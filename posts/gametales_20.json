        "text": "**Day 16, Tarsakh, 1489DR**\n\nAnother week passes. During breakfast Grimgar the half-orc appears in the common room. Along with his donkey Horace and a cart carrying a large chest. The party notices he is carrying a note similar to the one they were given so naturally the invite him to breakfast. After breakfast manage to get the Horace and the cart outside by dismantling it, the cart, not Horace. The party explain to Grimgar what's been going on and share their limited knowledge of the Paladin. Bittersweet is nowhere to be found this morning and Corrin guesses his probably passed out in a ditch somewhere.\n\nIt gets busy by mid-morning and Zing happens to look over his shoulder down in the common room, the party are dining upstairs on the second floor, he spots four thugs entering the inn. He recognizes one of them, a big half-orc with a small halfing sized mace tucked in his belt. Half his faced is burnt. He motions to the others and Corrin suggests he go down stairs and ask for his mace back. The others are completely against it and while they are discussing a commotion occurs below them.\n\nA pair of merchants, a dwarf and human, are arguing below them. The human merchant cries out \"if you want it so bad you can have it!\" He draws forth an odd shaped dagger and plunges it into the table. Suddenly electricity arcs out and strikes the man, he convulses but doesn't lose his grip from the dagger. The dwarf falls back off his chair and scrambles to his feet. The inn irrupts into chaos.\n\nThe party see the chaos as their queue to exit the inn so Zing and Gidyan race down stairs. Alas one of the thugs spots Gidyan. \"Hey Blanco! Isn't that the gnome that burnt your face?!\"\n\nBlanco the half-orc spins around. \"Yeah it is! Get him!\" The thugs draw weapons and the party decide to fight now and explain later.\n\nGrimgar and Mitch not being a part of the issue with the thugs, race downstairs to aid the human merchant. Grimgar reaches him and tries to grab the dagger. An arc of electricity lances out and shocks him. \"Ouch!\"\nCorrin races down to try and heal Grimgar but is noticed by Blanco. \"I think this belongs to you!\" He draws forth the small mace and swings at the halfling but Corrin blocks with his buck and a quarter staff.\n\nMitch jumps over the bar and tries to hide. The other thug standing next to Blanco prepares to attack Corrin but Mitch tosses a bottle at his head. \"Pick on someone ya own size!\"\n\nThe thug rubs the back of his head and turns around. \"Sounds good to me!\" He leaps over the bar and attacks Mitch.\n\nGrimgar moves to aid Corrin but Blanco is a skilled combatant.\n\nMeanwhile Zing and Gidyan are forced to deal with the other two thugs. Zing miss judges a fire bolt and sets fire to a woman's dress. Gidyan is struck several times by the thugs and is not looking good.\n\nGrimgar sees an opening to take Blanco's head off and swings his blade. At the last second Blanco ducks and the blade goes flying out of Grimgar's hand and across the room. \"Crap!\" Grimgar draws a dagger.\n\nMitch draws his warhammer, the thug rushes him but stumbles and Mitch is quick to shatter his skull. The thug drops to the ground dead. While the commotion continues Mitch decides to loot the body.\n\nCorrin breaks off from combat to help put out the burning woman's dress. At this stage, patrons are screaming and starting to flee the inn except for several who a frozen with shock and indecisiveness.\n\nBlanco turns his back on Grimgar for a moment to chase the halfling and that is all the other half-orc needs to stick a dagger in his back. Blanco drops the tiny mace and then drops to the floor.\n\nMitch jumps over the counter and seeing that the merchant is still clutching the dagger, brings down his warhammer on the man's wrist complete shattering it and separating it from his arm. The lightning arcs out and strikes an elven woman with a bow, a ranger by her garb.\n\nGidyan and Zing continue to fight the other two thugs. Neither gnome is faring well with their spells. \n\nGrimgar picks up the dagger and is shocked by it but holds on tightly. The electricity arcs out and strikes another patron, a half-elf. Not knowing what to do he slams the dagger into the table and just like that, the electricity stops.\nSuddenly Blackfist Guards burst into the inn. The thugs drop their weapons as do the party. Corrin rushes to help the man with the severed hand. \n\nExplanations are quickly made and backed up by the remaining patrons. The guards carry off the injured merchant and arrest the remaining thugs. They warn the party to not make it a habit of drawing weapons while within Phlan. The party ask if they can question the merchant since the dwarf he was arguing with has since disappeared. They tell them to come to the guard barracks later when the man has rested.\n\nThe other patrons leave and Madame Freona and her daughters begin cleaning up the mess. The two gnomes and halfling help clean up while Mitch and Grimgar examine the dagger. It appears to be made from a long tooth, probably a dragon tooth.\n\nGidyan confirms it while he's sweeping \"By its color and the blue sapphire attached to the pommel I'm going to guess blue dragon tooth. Also the electricity that was arcing around could be a clue.\"\n\nGrimgar not taking any chances removes the piece of wood from the table the dagger is stuck too and places both in a sack.\n\nMadame Freona is none too pleased and shoos the party out of the inn.\nOutside they ask some of the patrons who had been dining if they recognized the people struck by electricity. The human merchant is unknown to them but the elf was Syria, a ranger who frequents the Quivering Forest. The other half-elf was Schuyler, a food critic. The party decide to go to the barracks.\n\nAt the barracks they are allowed to speak to the merchant, his stump has been bandaged. His name is Trent. He tells them that the dwarf was an old \"friend\" named Yanna Hammerboud and he was selling the dagger to her but she didn't want to pay the amount she had originally agreed on - 1,000gp. He explains that he bought the dagger from a band of adventures outside Phlan who were looking to offload it for 250gp. They told him the dagger was attracted to metal and useful for fighting armored foes. He thanks the party for saving his life and they leave, heading back to the Tea Kettle.\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 4] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/51a0e5/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_4/)**",

        "text": "At the beginning of this summer, some of my friends and I started a D&amp;D campaign. None of us had ever played before, but we thought it would be fun.\n\nCharacters: Ulfgar, my brother's LN Dwarf Vengeance Paladin\nAoth, a Half-Elf CG Rogue\nGarrett, a NG Halfling Ranger\nFriophthiovr, a CG Half-Orc Barbarian (whose name we can't pronounce, henceforth known as Frito)\nIvellios, my CG High Elf Druid\nand Wombat Flurry, the jet black, white haired Gnome Bard, who was about the most chaotic thing I could imagine. Alignment was technically NE, but tended more towards chaotic. As you'll see.\n\nThe adventure began with Ulfgar touring a city square and seeing a wanted poster for a thief. That thief was Aoth, and he happened to be walking right in front of Ulfgar. Ulfgar then immediately attempted to arrest him. The problem with that was the number of ball bearings Aoth had invested in. Which was a lot. Which then caused Ulfgar to fall flat on his face. Aoth took advantage of the distraction and jumped up onto the rooftops. Or tried to anyway. He fell flat on his back. Then Ulfgar grappled him, only for Aoth to try to throw him off. Aoth had strength 8. Ulfgar had strength 17. This went predictably.\n\nAoth's player rolled a crit. \n\nUlfgar was judo-thrown through the saloon doors. Crashed into a table. And attracted the attention of Wombat, who was busy drinking at the bar. Who then decided to be very helpful. And cast silent image to make it look like the saloon was on fire. (It was at this point that our DM started giggling in horror). Then Frito chose to intervene, brandishing his greatsword at the rest of them. Then Aoth climbed onto another roof and started hurling insults and rocks at Frito. Garrett showed up, and then fired a warning shot. That promptly failed to intimidate anyone. Then the guards showed up, and tried to get Ivellios to help them stop the fighting. He refused, and climbed onto the roof of the saloon. \nWhich caved in.\nWhich dropped him on top of Wombat's drink. \nWhich led to Wombat holding a knife to his throat.\nMore guards poured into the square. Frito knocked Aoth out with a rock (not before he repeatedly insulted the Captain of the Guard's mother). Garrett tried to sneak away, only to frighten one of the guards into shooting one of his allies. Wombat screamed \"You'll never take me alive, and jumped out of the hole in the roof (displaying his amazing jumping skills) and landing in an alley filled with guards. He tried to stab one, and was then immediately cut down. The rest of the party surrendered, because the more psychotic of them were unconscious, before we were put into an enchanted sleep and taken away. \n\nIt was at this point that our DM gazed at us with shock and disappointment, shook his head, and prepared the next encounter. It goes about the same way, but that's a story for later.",

        "text": "So my friend was doing a campaign recently and he told me this story about the last session he'd done. The setting they were using was what we affectionately call 'Weebfinder' but I'm not sure exactly what it was. The GM was pretty tight with his story which only made all of this really funny.\n\nI'll be giving character rundowns as the story goes on.\n\nThe friend who told me the story (I'll call him BF) was playing a different version of a previous character who he'd played before. His character's Dad died at a young age so his mother turned to alcohol and to suppress the pain he watched anime all day and he eventually became a crusty-skinned weeaboo which made his mother commit suicide from shame. Then one day a giant lobster couple knocked on his door and said they were adopting him now and he became part of a lobster family. He got anxiety since he wasn't a real lobster so one day he came home with giant fake crab claws over his arms to become like them, but his parents were insulted because he got crab claws instead of lobster claws and so they started beating him. He ran away from home and then ran into a wizard who said he'd take him under his wing. The wizard turned his hands into real crab claws then dropped him right into a boss battle and that's where our story begins.\n\nThe boss was tough so they just barely managed to beat it with BF's help. Since they beat him, now they can return to the capital city which is basically the center of the world. They have to go through it every time they go somewhere so it's a significant place.\n\nWhen they enter the city they go to a general store and they start playing out their characters. DJ plays a little girl character who's supposed to be really young and naive. He pairs up with BF's character to do special attacks which they've done one of so far.\n\nIt involves using BF's character's flabby underarms to generate lift when DJ's character uses wind magic on them both, then flying as high as they possibly can before purposely falling at the enemy. Since they're falling DJ's character is put in danger and when that happens BF can take out a normal steel katana (he can only use a wooden one unless DJ's character is in danger) which he then puts in his mouth and they divebomb the enemy with the increased damage from falling. It's called the 9/11 Special because they do it twice.\n\nAnyway, they're in the general store and since DJ's character is supposed to be really naive she takes a chocolate bar and walks out without paying for it. So naturally, the guards try and arrest her, but BF's character comes in to defend her because she's tied to his sword and he's a bit useless without it.\n\nIn an effort to convince the guards to let her go he starts convincing the townspeople that the chocolate shelf was the 'free shelf' and all the citizens had the right to take from the free shelf. Within 5 minutes a fat crusty skinned weeaboo with crab claws for hands incites a revolution with the people who all start chanting 'Free Shelf! Free Shelf! Free Shelf!'\n\nPF nopes the hell out like he didn't know anybody as soon as it all starts. I wasn't told what PF's character's story was but he had a special ability which blinded, weakened and stunned, dealt 1d12 x2, was ranged and had aoe on it so it was basically a God Hand.\n\nDJ and BF's characters become the ringleaders of a revolution and since the GM didn't get what was going on, he arrested BF's character without giving him a chance to escape, but someone dropped a smokescreen and he manages to run away. But unfortunately BF's character is supposed to be vengeful and vindictive so as soon as he escapes he runs back into the general store and starts stealing handfuls of chocolate bars and then gets arrested again.\n\nNow that BF's character is gone, DJ's character is in trouble and the crowd is looking for the real ringleader of the Free Shelf revolution. So another friend, JK, uses his special ability which allows him to make bubbles of water (which were pretty strong by the way) to lift people up and whatnot. So he lifts DJ's character above the crowd but then suddenly pops the bubble and shouts that DJ's character was the culprit and the crowd converges on her.\n\nThe GM finally gets enough and says that God comes down and wipes everyone's memory of the past 24 hours because they'd just gotten almost everyone in the capital city they were supposed to go to every time they did anything to hate them and he asks what the deal was.\n\nThen they spill the beans.\n\nMy friend had organized a fun little activity they were going to do that session. They decided that they were going to play like DJ's character was Jesus and this session was when he was being crucified, and the only ones who weren't in on it were DJ and the GM.\n\nBF was playing the role of Thomas who was jealous of John who was the closest to Jesus, which was why his character tried inciting a rebellion in the populace\n\nJC which I hadn't mentioned in the story was playing the role of John (He's playing spiderman by the way)\n\nPF played the role of Peter who denied Jesus three times by noping the hell out right at the start. The GM wasn't in on it though so no one asked him if he knew DJ's character\n\nAnd JK's character played the role of Judas who betrayed Jesus by dropping DJ's character into the crowd to get crucified.\n\nThe best part was none of it was planned beforehand. BF just said \"DJ's character is Jesus and we're all the disciples.\" And they googled which disciples to do literally just before they walked in the door. They didn't know what was going to happen but it ended up working perfectly. At some point DJ had even said that JC was the only person he trusted in the campaign.\n\nSo yeah. That's how my friend ended up playing out the Crucifixion of Jesus during the Chocolate War.",

        "text": "Well, I have not written anything in this sub yet, but last weekend, when I was playing a solo session with my bf /u/Silmacil gming, we had a nice, unexpected thing happening, which lead to a spirit being summoned, which lead to a story quite fit for this sub.\n\nThe two of us are playing Shadowrun a lot. In two alternating groups every second Wednesday and in a duo campaign (with us gming alternating). In that duo campaign my character has gotten into a conflict with one of the best founded local gangs after a run went sour and made a deal with local law enforcement to help her get out of the shadows, if she helps them to get rid of the gang. So a two sided vendetta started.\n\nDuring this campaign the character had become aware of actually being magic – even though her magic is really weak (in game terms her magic is 2) and she is aspected. \n\nSo much for the backdrop.\n\nThe evening started right where we left of before. She finally had managed to catch the toxic shaman of said gang and hand him over to local law enforcement. It had been a long night and as she did not want to endanger her normal home, she decided to spent the night (or more: The early morning) in one of her save houses. \n\nWhen she woke up around noon, she wanted to drive home, but discovered, that somebody (most probably a sentient ghoul, as her save house is in the middle of a ghoul zone) had stolen her cars wheels. So she had to phone a contact and wait, deciding to shower, while waiting.\n\nNow there was a problem. The save house, which used to be a graveyards morgue, had no proper heating system. Not for the rooms, not for the water. And it is one of the coldest winters Hamburg had ever seen. So she decided that while she was waiting, she could as well experiment a bit with the magic. Being aspected as a summoner she decided to try and summon a force 2 fire spirit, which she did and asked it whether it could help her heat the water. \n\nThe spirit, introducing itself with the name of Pukk (which is probably not it's real name), was overjoyed that it had been summoned and gladly obliged, even though not without poking a hole into the wall. Details... It was released after the shower and left a burn on the table cloth, when returning to the astral realms. \n\nThat was it with that, the character thought, went home and did nothing much for the rest of the day. \n\nNext day she gets up only to find the spirit waiting in her bathroom, asking whether it should heat the water again. A bit taken by surprise (after all most spirits tend to only do their services begrudgingly) she allowed the spirit to heat the water, as she could not bring herself to explain to the little guy, that the flat she is living in, has an actual heating system, and offered to give it some sort of payment. Maybe something it could burn or something the like. The spirit gladly accepted.\n\nYet another day passed and she went after the last mage that was known to be in the gang. She already knew his hide out, which turned out to be a pretty normal flat, and decided to just wait there and observe – sooner or later he would show up. She used some drones for the observation and became bored. So she decided to just try and summon the little helpful fire spirit again – this time succeeding quite well in it. She talked a little with it, while it offered to keep her coffee warm. Being addicted to coffee, she obviously agreed.\n\nFinally the mage showed up and Pukk, the fire spirit, asked to help. “Fine”, my character agreed, “but do not act, before I have made my move.” After all there were normal people on the street all around and she did not want to create a scene. \n\nWhile the mage walked home from a garage, she followed him and tapped him on a shoulder – with him reacting as shocked as she had hoped for. Well, of course for Pukk, the fire spirit, this was her move and he attacked the mage... And ended up critically wounding him, due to the mage being really bad at soaking the damage. Not so long story even shorter: Two attacks from the force two fire spirits later, the mage was toast. Literally. My character did not even get a chance to act. ~~(In game terms: The mage just rolled badly, even when he used edge to correct a critically glitched evasion roll, he just glitched again and soaked as badly.)~~\n\nShe handed in the mage with local law enforcement and really had to give it to Pukk, that he had basically managed that fight on his own, and be it thanks to luck.\n\nSunset neared and the spirit actually became sad, that it would have to go. As it had mentioned that there was a certain tree with wood, that burned really neat, she offered him, to bring him there before sunset. The spirit agreed and on the way, my character asked, whether it wanted to stay. The spirit said yes. She explained to him, that it would mean to bind him. He was okay with it. As she had not the slightest idea, how binding a spirit works, she just made stuff up – but it worked, somehow.\n\nSo... Now my character, that really does not have a proper idea yet, how the magic deal works, has a bound Force 2 fire spirit named Pukk, that is more then happy to heat water for showers and help her make coffee – and that only, because a sentient ghoul stole her car's wheels.",

        "text": "Sticks prided himself on always making good decisions. He always seemed to know just who to talk to in order to get ahead in life,who to side with, who to oppose, when to oppose them. He never made a \"bad\" decision in his life. So when he saw an abandoned gas station near an equally-abandoned settlement, he felt complete confidence in his decision to raid it and use it as a base of operations.\n\n\"C'mon, Stones,\" he appealed to his partner-in-crime, a meat mountain of a man who he wasn't entirely sure if he was a Super Mutant or not. \"Think of the possibilities! We've always said we deserve more than scavving around, picking at other Raiders' leftovers like a couple of fuckin' vultures! This could be the perfect foothold for our climb to the top!\"\n\n\"I guess,\" Stones nodded in agreement. \"I'm not saying I'm on-board yet, but lemme hear more.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" conceded Sticks. He never could persuade Stones on the first try. The man was as bullheaded as a Brahmin. \"So here's what I'm thinking. We hit up the settlement first; you, me, and a few of our best guys. That way, if things somehow go south when we decide to take over the gas station, we have a base of operations to fall back on without having to trek halfway across the Commonwealth. Then, we can build defenses between the two until they're linked up.\"\n\n\"And what is at these two locations that would make them worth overtaking?\" Stones asked.\n\n\"For one, the settlement's pretty big,\" Sticks explained. \"When I scouted it out, I counted out at least six houses, there might've been more. Looked pretty undermanned, too. Plus it's right by a natural river, so all we'd need to do is build a purifier or two and we'd have clean water out the wazoo!\"\n\n\"And the gas station?\"\n\n\"Well, it probably has some materials we could use, and we could probably use it as an office, maybe?\" Sticks added hopefully; he knew how much Stones wanted his own office. To Stones, an office was a sign of importance to the world.\n\n\"Fine,\" Stones acquiesced after a minute of silent thinking. \"I'm in. On one condition.\"\n\n\"Name it, pal.\"\n\n\"I want the gas station as my office. You can use one of the buildings in the settlement for yours if you want, but the gas station is mine.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Sticks didn't want the gas station as his own office anyway; it was on a hill, had hardly any defenses (that he'd seen), and it probably smelled like gasoline. \"So, when are we doing this?\"\n\n\"I'd say tomorrow, but if you wanna give it a week, that's fine too,\" suggested Stones.\n\n\"Nah, who knows what could happen in a week? The sooner we hit it, the better,\" Sticks replied. \"We'll do it tomorrow, crack of dawn to get the jump on anybody who might be bunking there.\"\n\nAnd so it was planned; they would hit the settlement first. They would hit it hard and fast, not giving any potential squatters a chance to mount any type of defense. Easy prey.\n\nBy that time the next day, more than 2/3 of the group Sticks and Stones had brought along, including Stones himself, were all dead.\n\nIt had happened so incredibly fast. Sticks noticed a guard tower near the entrance to the settlement, so he gave the order for weapons free. He sent one of the group's snipers up to the tower to give surveillance and pick off any potential ambushes. They were halfway down the street when they heard the explosion, and turned around to see the tower crumbling down in a burning heap.\n\nAnd just like that, all hell had broken loose. Gunfire suddenly erupted from every house on the street, and Sticks tried to fight back, drawing his rifle and taking potshots while running for cover, to no avail. He took a bullet to the thigh and went down hard, sprawled out in the dirt. He got up just in time to see Stones collide with a gigantic orange robot. It had the head and body of a Robobrain and the arms and legs of a Sentrybot. It blindsided Stones with a rushing tackle, then blasted him away with a wall of concussive force that sent him tumbling into the river.\n\nSticks looked around him. Half of his crew lay dead or dying, and the settlers were picking off more and more by the second. Sticks lobbed a grenade in their direction, but one of them knocked it back at him and it exploded, sending him flying back. When he got back up, he once again saw Stones assaulting the orange Sentrybot.\n\n\"Sticks, ***RUN!!!***\" his old friend shouted as he wrestled with the robot's arms. He got knocked back and pulled out a Super Sledge, swinging it full-force into the robot's head. The robot's arms drooped and the legs buckled from underneath it, and it stopped moving entirely. Stones raised his hammer to shout victoriously, but he was stopped by the sound of rapidly-approaching heavy footsteps. He turned around just in time to see a demonic-looking red robot charging him, buzzsaw arms raised and spinning ferociously. This one was all-red, every bit an Assaultron but the head, which looked like a demonic horned skull, and the signature red glow of a Sentrybot's eye gave it an even more ethereal appearance.\n\nStones turned to meet his new foe, and was rewarded for his bravery by the red demon carving off one of his arms like a knife through warm butter. Stones reacted by swinging his hammer at the robot's head like he did with the orange one, but with only one arm behind the swing the power behind the blow was lessened significantly, though the robot did stagger backward. Sticks suddenly remembered that Stones told him to run, and run he did, not turning back to see the wound that caused Stones to cry out in pain like he did.\n\n\"Dammit, how did the day go so fucking *wrong*?! he berated himself later on. He'd planned everything perfectly, from how many people he brought along to who he brought along to where they'd enter the settlement. What had he missed?\n\n\"Thoughts for later,\" he decided. For now, he had to make his way to the gas station. He would be damned if he came away from this incident empty-handed, and he needed a safe place to fix himself up besides, so he headed southeast to the Red Rocket station.\n\nWhen he finally arrived, he saw a sight that made his stomach drop; a man standing outside, holding a rifle, which was pointed right at him.\n\nAs the bullets ripped through him, his last thought was, \"I never make good decisions...\"",

        "text": "A fairly normal Chicago day, sometime in the near future, in a world very much like ours ' and yet oh so different, a group of gamers enter the local game store to try out the overhaul of Ogres and Oubliettes, a VR RPG system that actually allows you to experience your character's thoughts and feelings while playing. They meet up with The Game Master, a player who acts as a moderator for a small group of players. The Game Master can be petitioned at any time to provide extra information about the world, but his primary job is to control certain NPCs as they interact with the party.\n\nThe group enters the store, excited to try the new equipment, and even more excited for the new \"points\" system, which ranks the players against every other in the world. With the help of the GM, the players don the new VR headsets and enter the game world.\n\nThey were shocked as they entered this imaginary world. The reality around them was just as real to their senses as the one they lived in. The ground was hard beneath their feet, the air filled with the sounds and even smells of some big city. The mind of the characters merged with that of the players, and they then truly felt as one with this strange world.\n\nOur story within a story begins with Simon, a human bard. He owns a small shop in a part of town with an unsavory reputation. Simon spends his days sitting and waiting for someone to show interest in one of his many exotic rarities, today being an important looking gentleman examine a \"Stallion's Rod\" to assist him with his marital problems. Eyeing a sucker, Simon, now controlled by the player Joey, convinced the man that what he really ought to purchase are these \"rare herbs from Nepal\" (simply ground willow leaves) that would cure his problem over the months to come. Knowing Simon might be interested, the man pays his fees in the form of a tip about some expensive product. Simon closes his store, finds a street urchin, and sends him off with a message.\n\nThe next character to spring to life is Arson, a human saboteur. He begins the game by merging with his player, Ted, and noticing he is located in a rather seedy bar. Without even waiting long he eyes his mark, a drunk lass sitting by herself, and steals her purse all while looking her in the eye and flirting. A young man, clearly not belonging in this tavern, casually slips him a message. He pickpockets the boy as he leaves, taking a dagger and purse. \n\nThe two men meet up near 22nd street, a neighborhood mostly occupied by poor humans and the beastfolk, and also where Simon owns his shop. The two discuss their plans, and agree to assemble a team to steal the goods, revealed to be tens of thousands of dollars worth of rare dyes.\n\nSo the team is slowly gathered. A Drow Wizard, Zu'ul, a Goblin Alchemist, Bogrot, and the final player being a Sylph Rogue. Upon her entry into the world, she was arrested by moderators for previous actions as a different character.\n\nSo the team must break her out of prison. The cutpurse watches the streets from the roof, waiting for a signal that might never come. \n\nThe wizard crouches in shadow, waiting for the Bard to come back out. It was agreed that they were allowed one hour to complete the prison break. At the end of that hour, the Mage would create a distracting explosion, bringing the jail's only two guards outside.\n\nAs for the bard himself, he likes the diplomatic approach. He worked for hours to craft himself false credentials that said he was working with the governing council. He even has a signet ring from one of the councilmen, and a false mustache. \n\nHe enters the building casually. Introducing himself as Burt Reynolds, esq, he demands to speak with the prisoner on behalf of the council. The two guards are actually convinced by his incredible performance, and they allow the meeting. The two leave the prison peacefully, the guards wondering if that was stupid.\n\nThey spend the day gathering information on the warehouse the heist is to take place at. They learn the patterns of the guards, they question witnesses of a previous robbery attempt, and they even gain the permission of the goblin mafia to go through with the plan.\n\nThey didn't even have the slightest chance of failure. They learn every part of the building flawlessly, thanks to \"building inspectors Dolph Lundgren and Christina Aguilera\". \n\nAnd the heist goes well, no lock can protect the goods, no guard will ever notice them, and no trap could catch them unaware. \n\nThe A-Team succeeds at their mission, the players remove their helmets, and the game master chuckles and goes home to post about his experience on Reddit.",

        "text": "Synopsis of Shattered Sea\n\nCharacters:\nDwadda (Halfling Rogue)\nCaede (Sylph Sorcerer)\nDavick (Half Orc Barbarian)\nDavayne (Human Shaman)\nTahn (Human Wizard)\n??? (Catfolk Rogue)\nLater \nBim’Notten (Gnome Bard)\nKinora (Lifespark Construct Fighter)\nBelladonna (Strix Cleric)\nKouko (Kitsune Swashbuckler)\n\nThe setting I’ve created is of a chaotic archipelago that used to be a continent. Hundreds of years ago there was a great cataclysm, and the continent and the Empire spanning it was annihilated, and this collection of strange eldritch islands is what remains. \n\nParty awakens as prisoners aboard a pirate ship, bound to end up as slaves in the next port. As they attempt to fight their way out, the pirate ships is engaged in combat by an Aurelian Man o’ War, which was tasked with purging pirates from the region. Aurelians are colonists from the mainland, with deep water ships and imperialistic attitudes.\n\nAfter the pirate crew is slaughtered as the superiorly armed and trained Aurelians board the ship, the party are discovered. After a brief exchange with the captain, Lord Pierre Trudeau, the party are forced off the side, instead of being executed for piracy. \nThe party swims ashore on a tropical island filled with massive insects, with no food, water, weapons, money or armour. After finding food and water in the jungle (think dire strawberries), the party decides to climb the mountain, which appears to have a large cave entrance near its peak.\n\nThe party is happened upon by a giant toad, which decided that the party will make a juicy meal. Dwadda runs, and the party are nearly defeated by this hulking monster. Davick manages to impale the monster on some makeshift spears he’d fashioned earlier. The toad then vomits out its last meal as it dies, an unconscious human shaman named Davayne. He decides to join with the party, as he has nowhere else to go.\n\nDuring this adventure, Dwadda attempts to befriend a giant spider near the caves edge. She succeeds and is carried inside by it. The party watch, baffled, unsure of what just happened. They decide to rescue her.\n\nAfter entering a cave filled with horse sized spiders, they party nervously walks though, surrounded on all sides, though the spiders don’t seem to attack. They meet a friendly elderly Drider inside, who describes the spiders as her children. Dwadda is perfectly safe, drinking tea in the Lady Lydia’s library. After spending a pleasant afternoon chatting and reading books, she informs them of where they can find a human settlement on the island, and the party says goodbye, with the giant spider Rupert in tow. \n\nLydia gives the party some parting gifts to the party, an enchanted map and a compass that points east. The map, who refers to himself as Skri’Bel, considers Caede to be its master.\n\nIn the village on the islands eastern shore, the party encounter a town afraid of a strange malady that has affected a young girl. Believing her to be possessed by a demon, the towns clerics are desperately praying for their god (Deus Rex) to save her. Deus Rex is considered the One True God by the residents of the Shattered Sea, much the same as Jehovah from Judaism. \n\nIn the town, the party also meet a human wizard named Tahn, who was the only survivor from a recent shipwreck. He agrees to tag along when the tavern owner hires the party to get revenge on a giant crab who took his wife away from him. The party are baffled when said crab beats the snot out of Davick and then challenges them to a game of rock, paper, scissors, loses, then challenges them to noughts and crosses (which it wins). The surprisingly intelligent crab then takes the unconscious Davick with it to a nearby cave. The party follow. \n\nInside the cave, the party meet a woman who appears to be leading the crabs. The innkeeper exclaims that it is his wife who was taken last month. She informs him that living as his housewife was the most boring fate she could think of, and is much happier amongst the crabs. The party is then informed Davick is now her captive, and to free him they’d have to beat her champion in an arm wrestle. This champion was a massive crab named Petunia. The party immediately chose Davick. She honoured their choice and revived him, so he could fight for his freedom. It was a tough battle, but Davick eventually beat Petunia. Caede then attempted to befriend the devastated crab whilst the party demanded compensation from the innkeeper’s wife. \n\nIndignant, she refuses, so the party jump her, killing her and taking her crown, which as it turns out allows one to enslave crabs. Davick breaks it under his boot, and the party loot her treasure. Free from her control, Petunia is convinced to follow Caede and they take her with them. The innkeeper returns as well, shocked by what happened.\n\nBack in the town, the catfolk realises that the little girl is not possessed, she merely has rabies, which can look like possession to superstitious villagers. Pretending to be an exorcist, she gets Davayne to use a cure light wounds spell on her, which eases some of her symptoms. She then pretends to have banished the spirit, and the town throws a celebration. The little girl is still dying of rabies however, Davayne only bought her a few hours. \n\nMeanwhile Davick, Caede and Dwadda have decided to ransack the only decent ship in the harbour, which is owned by an itinerant Warden of Veritas, (think a medieval Brotherhood of Steel). They burn it down afterwards, regretting it nearly instantly. They attempt to tie some fishing boats together with spiderweb to make their escape.  When he discovers what they are doing, they murder him and flee the village, in their makeshift craft.\n\nParty sails to a nearby island, which it turns out has an orc village upon it. Inside, Davick is welcomed, and the town celebrate that one of their brethren has returned to them. The rest of the party meanwhile sneak to the docks and murder some porters and crew unloading a caravel, and hijack the ship, abandoning Davick, whose player had to leave the campaign for personal reasons. The catfolk was killed attempting to befriend a wild pterosaur while she was at one hitpoint.\n\nThe party sail off, and find a couple of strange things in the hold. One is a burlap sack which is rolling around on the floor. Inside, they find a bound up and gagged gnome named Bim’Notten. In a large ebony crate in the hold, they find a disassembled construct. Touching her soul gem, she pleads them to reassemble her. The party get into a heated debate whether the reassemble her or just steal her soul gem as a power source. Kinora, the construct, is eventually put back together and the party make land at a nearby island, where Kinora’s master’s lab had been constructed.\n\nFinding the lab infested with kobolds, the party go on a murdering spree. Kinora understands Draconic, and knows that these kobolds were merely villagers who were currently celebrating a birthday, but refrains from telling the party that they are slaughtering innocents.\n\nCutting their way through the lab, the party ends up killing its chief, stealing a kobold egg and a kyrana egg. Kinora finds the aged bones of her master in the rubble, and the party deciphers a puzzle and finds a scroll which confers a soul binding spell on those who read it. After pillaging every valuable the kobolds owned, they then left.\n\nThey decide to travel to the closest city, Port Marcarth. On the way they are ambushed by Draugr Pirates. After a tense battle, Dwadda takes the captains hat and declares herself captain of the ghost ship. They take the still animated Draugr captains head and replace the wooden mermaid figurehead’s head with his. They tie both ships together and investigate the other ship. They soon learn that all the skeletons and zombies who are taking up the oars are trapped souls, who can only be freed by having another person take their place. \n\nAfter some more sailing, Dwadda “accidentally” crashes into another vessel. The party rescue the survivors and their cargo, and Dwadda tricks a few of them into taking up the oars. Two particular rowers are freed to roam the ship as Draugr, Scab and Valerie (both male). \n\nAfter a few days of sailing, the party reach Port Marcarth, a bustling city in the Meridian Confederacy. After docking, Bim uses a charm spell on Dockmaster, waving off the need to pay their docking and protection fees. \n\nThe party decide to hire a cleric of Deus Rex to decurse the Draugr ship, without informing Dwadda of course. Meanwhile, the party do some shopping and investigating for a shipment of stolen soul gems which were supposed to have been sold here, since Davayne had left his home to search for them. Kinora decides to leave the party.\n\nDavayne and Dwadda learn that the resident private security firm, Vanguard Security, is currently in possession of these gems at one of their warehouses in the Typhoon District. Vanguard Security of course, is the organisation who owns the docks. Meanwhile, Caede and Bim are attempting to have some documents forged, and Caede agrees to have dinner with a half orc from the docks.\n\nIn order to find the information, Dwadda and Davayne went to a house in Argus District to ensure that the owner pays up on her many debts, as she’s been running a few fraud scams against an information broker the party were talking to. They end up killing her and taking her house for themselves. Dwadda frees an enslaved unicorn she was keeping. \n\nThe unicorn, Persephone, appears to have an eating disorder and has a generally defeatist attitude. While the party were out doing these this, Vanguard Security noticed that their ship’s docking and protection fees had not been paid, so they boarded the ship, kidnapped their pets (Rupert, Petunia and a Pterasur named Palf) and trashed the ship. Kristy’s new character, Belladonna (Strix Cleric), a devotee of Orphan (Fallen Archangel, King of Hell), joins the party after sensing Dwadda’s overwhelming chaotic aura.\n\nThe party were naturally outraged when they found this out. Bim attempted to assault on of the Vanguards and was arrested and imprisoned. While this happened, a massive Warden galleon pulled into the harbour. That night, the party planned to storm the vanguard compound where Bim and their pets were being kept. Beforehand, Davayne started trying his hand at proper necromancy, and tasked Dwadda to find him some animal corpses, cats in particular. Dwadda went on a killing spree for any cats she could find, from old tabbies to kittens. She even murdered a couple of wolverines fossicking in the garbage and added their bodies to the bag of holding. During this time Bim escaped from jail with the assistance of a young vampire, promising her Persephone in exchange for her help escaping.\n\nBack home, as Davayne prepared for the ritual, Dwadda decided to use the dead animal’s blood to make a circle around the pile of corpses, making it an offering the to god Deus Rex, though she wrote in the circle, “Love from the Wardens.” The blood seems to drain into the floor and the lines of the circle turned to ash. A few seconds later an earthquake started.\n\nNow, when I rolled for the magnitude of this earthquake I rolled a 100 on the d100. This was a category 10 earthquake on the Richter scale. A good portion of the city sank into the ocean and property damage was widespread. Many lost their lives.\n\nGoing outside, the party decided now was a great time to hit the Vanguard compound. On the way they encountered some ratfolk who appeared to be burning down buildings. The ratfolk, or Skaven as they called themselves, had apparently built a “Shakey Shake” weapon and were deciding to conquer the surface after centuries of persecution at the hands of Port Marcarth. The party took advantage of this and showed them where the Vanguard compound was located. \n\nThey snuck in during the ensuing assault on the compound. They freed their pets and crushed the Vanguard troops.  Meanwhile, there is the sound of battle coming from Typhoon district. The party decide to head there, and Bella flies ahead. Bella assists a priestess of Ourabouros, a demon lord of Wrath, who is in town for her own reasons, assault a team of Wardens who are moving a massive container from Typhoon to their own ship. Ursula storms up the Wardens, ready to annihilate them. Unfortunately, Bella had lied to Ursula about the Warden’s actual numbers. The Wardens began to overpower the underprepared priestess, and she was forced to flee, swearing vengeance against Bella. \n\nBella began to fly back, but stops at an alchemist’s shop, where the shopkeeper had sold her a bag of cats the previous day for ~70gp. The shopkeeper never lied about the contents of the bag, Bella bought one that had three cats inside, and decided she’d been ripped off. So she flew inside and tried to loot the place, but the shopkeeper had left a note on the desk of an empty shop, which was slowly sinking into the ground. \n\nThe note simply said, “I hope you enjoy the explosive runes looter.”\nBella is knocked unconscious and the building continues to sink into the ground. Bella eventually escapes the sinking building, though her player decides to leave the campaign. Bella dies drinking an expired potion.\n\nThe rest of the party continue on their merry way to Typhoon, to rescue Davayne’s soul gems from the warehouse. Unfortunately, they are two late, and a three pronged war between the Wardens, Vanguard and the Skaven is underway. The party talk to a Skaven oracle, who agrees to take them under the city to be judged whether they are worthy of meeting their god. \n\nIn the sewers, the come to a chamber with glowing purple water, with a number of rusty barrels floating in it. Through it, a makeshift city can be seen. In order to enter, the party must drink the water, which the oracle refers to as the Waters of Life. Bim grows a pair of beautiful fairy wings, Caede is feebleminded, Tahn gains 3 intelligence, Davayne catches fire, Dwadda is turned into a toad.\n\nBim and Tahn are judged worthy and allowed to enter, though Tahn refuses. Bim keeps Dwadda in her backpack and travels to the Skaven Cathedral, where she meets the Skaven’s God, Rakshasa. As it turns out, Rakshasa is merely a powerful demon serving the Demon Lord Avarice, King of Greed. He agrees to cure Caede and Dwadda in exchange for Bim’s service, though prior to this he’d spoken with Dwadda, and was impressed by her actions, and gave her an infernal reward for her crimes against Deus Rex from Orphan. Dwadda gained a fiendish template and was restored to her true form. \n\nThe party returned to the surface, where Davayne died from his wounds (player left the party). Kouko, a kitsune swashbuckler, spots the party, with their myriad of pets. She waits in the shadows for a moment, gauging their strength. A couple of moments later a beautiful woman with feathery wings and platinum hair stumbles into her from behind. She asks for directions, and Kouko points her over to the square where the party is standing. \n\nShe reveals herself as Celaena, an angel sent to hunt down the blasphemer Dwadda. Dwadda, having recently gained the visage of a demon, demanded that Celaena show her proof that she was the one she was looking for. Growing flustered, the party continues to taunt her until she starts crying and teleports away. Kouko introduces herself to the group.\n\nA male angel shows up this time, claiming to be Celaena’s boyfriend. After the party then begins making fun of him for having such a stupid girlfriend, he begins crying as well, shattering the illusion. It was just Celaena in disguise, pretending to be her own boyfriend. Eventually her temper snaps at the party, and they defeat her in combat. Bim manages to steal a few vials of the Waters of Life, one of which she gives to Kouko and Palf. Kouko is now unable to lie and Palf has polymorphed from a pterosaur to a medium white dragon.\n\nThe party leave the city after killing a couple of trolls (one of which was undead). Skri’Bel tells Bim how to find the Great Library of Antonidas, in exchange for signing a contract to free him when it is found. The party sets sail northeast, where the compass now leads.\n\nThe party is sailing along, and they decide they want to go fishing. Instead of using the rods down in the hold, they fire a bunch of lightning into the water. A plethora of dead fish rise to the surface, as well as a stunned Sahuagin. After conversing with the Sahuagin after it awakens, they learn that they just destroyed this particular tribe’s food source for the next year. \n\nThe party meet with the Sahuagin shaman, and Caede challenges him to a duel. After a bit of goading, he agrees to fight three of the party members at once. The Shaman is defeated and killed, and Caede inherits his title through victory.\n\nCaede is then escorted to the Sahuagin village, since she has an amulet of water breathing, which appears to have been fashioned from the remnants of sunken ships. There, she is taken to the Shaman’s quarters, as she has decided to train the village’s next shaman. Inside however, the walls move, strange colours never before perceived by the mortal eye shine into being, the room is simultaneously too big and too small for its container. Dark shapes watch her from corners blacker than the abyss. In that place, she allows a small tendril of an ancient being to enter her ear. Its voice speaks only to her, and offers her great power, for a terrible price. \n\nIn the room, she finds a large chest, filled with bars of solid gold. They’re pressed with the seal of the East Aurelian Trading Company, and the chest is far too heavy to lift. She returns to the party and gets them to sail over the village. From there they drop the anchor on the village and ride it down. Sahuagin were already busy picking up gold bars, and they’re fairly spread out as the dust settles. The party all grab armfuls of gold and ride the anchor back up. They drop down again for more gold, crushing one of the villager’s houses. \n\nThey do this several more times, destroying a good section of the settlement before the militia mobilises, and the party are caught underwater while shark men surround them, wanting vengeance for the destruction they’ve caused. Caede offers a portion of her sanity to the tendril, whom she has named Gary, in exchange for her rescue, as well as all the stolen gold to be returned. After that session, Caede has become paranoid and untrusting of others, and is starting to hallucinate. Kuoko takes a level in Dragonrider and bonds with Palf.\n\nContinuing on, the party encounters an Aurelian Man ‘o’ War. Caede bargains with Gary to assist them in taking the ship, so he ‘helps’ by teleporting the party from their ship onto the Aurelian vessel, completely surrounded by Aurelian troops. After some negotiation and likely the captain, Commodore Remington Noir, developing a crush on Caede, the Aurelians offer to sail them back to their own vessel, which ran ashore due to having no one but a giant spider to drive it.\n\nMeanwhile, the only crew member still aboard the player’s vessel is Tahn, who was tied up for his own good to not chase after sirens. After the ship runs aground, a horde of small, bipedal doglike creatures clamber aboard. He recognises them as gremlins. They go about stealing everything they can get their hands on, including Tahn’s spellbook and the gold bars. When the party arrive they notice all their shit being stolen, so they naturally try to get it back. They see a gremlin eat an entire gold bar, and promptly kill the gremlin. They soon realise with horror that the gold is not inside the creature. Indeed, its gullet doesn’t even lead to a digestive system, but to the Dreaming, the realm of the Fae. \n\nIn the meantime, Dwadda is accidently swallowed by a gremlin, which places her in a beautiful, flowery meadow in the dreaming. A nearby satyr notices her and mistakes the halfling for a child. He then ‘escorts’ her further into the dreaming, though eventually she escapes his clutches. Inside the Dreaming, Dwadda searches desperately for a way back to the meadow. She eventually encounters Rupert (the giant spider), as Rupert allowed himself to be swallowed to save her.\n\nThey soon learn that salt water causes these creatures to dissolve and set about butchering them before they can eat any more of their stuff. Further in, they fall into a gremlin’s pit trap, and are accosted by a small army of the critters. Caede solves this problem with a simple fireball, wiping them out bar one. She then tells him he’s her property, and so Wampi became Caede’s new minion.\n\nWampi then leads them to the gremlin village, to the chief’s hut. The party propose a solution the to gremlin chief that if they all ate eat other they could return home, to the fae realm. The chief agrees, and Caede demands that Wampi stays behind, as there has to be a last gremlin. The entire tribe are then coerced to shove each other down their throats.\n\nThe party search around and manage to get some of the gold back. They then retreat to the ship to wait for Dwadda to return.\nDwadda and Rupert meanwhile, are coercing the satyr to guide them back to the meadow. After an encounter with a hostile fae, Rupert devours the fae’s corpse. Rupert then undergoes a metamorphosis, turning into a full drider. They eventually reach the meadow, and the gremlins have already build a small wooden village here. They find the chief, and Rupert pushes Dwadda down his throat before jumping in himself. They arrive back in the Gremlins original town. \nThe party on the other hand, attempted to craft using the Aurelian gold as a reagent. When they tried this they set off an alarm spell which signalled to the closest Aurelan warship that the gold is in danger. They desperately tried to break the spell, but to no avail. They then decided to wait until Dwadda returned, or the Aurelians arrived, whichever came first. \n\nIt wasn’t until three days later that Dwadda reappeared on the material plane. A tense race starts as the party spot an Aurelian battleship approaching on the horizon. They buy some time with a silent image, but luckily Dwadda and Rupert make it back safely.\n\nIn the next session, the party encounter a colossal dragon turtle whilst sailing west, making for the Kashkuri Isles. The Turtle demanded some kind of tribute for passing through its territory. The party offered one of the vials of the Waters of Life they’d been saving. Accepting it as tribute, the Turtle allowed them to visit its lair, where a fortune rivalling that of empires was being stored. Its centrepiece is a wreck of a flying ship that Kregorax sunk himself.\n\nMoving on, the party sail west to Kashkur, in order to sell their pile of gold. While sailing, in the early hours of the morning they are ambushed by Kaskuri privateers. The party manages to fight off the pirates, destroy one of their ships and plunder the other, pressing the crew into service. They then sail through the treacherous reefs of the Kashkui Isles, making for the capital, Drakensport. The party are currently enjoying this picturesque, peaceful city, and have learned that their gold is cursed to teleport them and the gold should they attempt to tamper with it again. The only way to unlock the Aurelian gold? Take the key from the captain of an Aurelian warship. They have left the gold deposited in a Kashkuri bank, who will charge a fee for how long it’s kept there. \n\n",

        "text": "About a week passes and the party take full advantage of free food and board. During breakfast Mitch the dwarf appears in the common room. The party notices he is carrying a note similar to the one they were given so naturally the invite him to breakfast. Before they can finish eating they hear screams coming from outside. Corrin, the heroic halfling cleric, leaps out of his high-chair and rushes to find out what's going on.\n\nThe rest of the party finish breakfast and go outside.\n\nOutside a hysterical woman holding a child is trying to get the help of the local constabulary, the Black Fist guard, but they don't seem to be interested in dealing with a problem outside the city limits. The party approaches the woman, Millivent Moss, she tells them that her husband, her older children and a few of their hired hands where attacked by goblins while farming peat in a bog outside Phlan. Her husband told her to flee and she jumped onto the wagon and headed back to Phlan. She could see the goblins rounding everyone up at sword point before she lost sight of them.\n\nThe party gather their gear and Corrin purchases a buck and a quarter staff to replace his lost mace. The jump aboard the wagon with Millivent and head off to the bog. They reach the bog and tell Millivent to stay put until they return. The party scatter and look for tracks and eventually they find the goblin and victims footprints in the mud. The tracks lead to a small hill with a cave opening. Outside the hill the party spot a goblin talking to a human-sized figure dressed in heavy cloaks. Corrin feeling conflicted about whether eavesdropping is considered lying takes his time decided what to do but is coaxed into sneaking up to the pair by the others.\n\nThe heavy cloaked man tells the goblin that \"his people friends will pay lots of coin and give lots of gifts for all of the dragon artifacts you can find. And kill any other humans who you find near your home.” The goblin agrees and goes into the cave, the heavy cloaked man speaks a magical phrase and vanishes.\n\nThe party formulate a plan and decide to sneak into the cave. They fail to spot some arrow holes in the wall opposite the entrance and Zing stumbles over some rocks piled up in the passage way causing a mini rockslide. And a hell of a lot of noise!\nA pair of goblins opens fire on the group hitting Bittersweet and Gidyan. Mitch runs up ahead followed by Corrin and runs across a tripwire that triggers a trap which drops rocks from above behind him. Corrin and Bittersweet a hit by the rocks and a little bit annoyed and in some pain.\n\nZing trades Fire Bolts, and Gidyan his Ray of Frost with the goblin archers as the rest of the group enter a room with three more goblins and a pair of wolves in cages. Battle is joined and two of the goblins attack the party while a third releases one of the wolves. One of the goblin archers turns and fires at the group while his buddy hits Zing with a nasty arrow to the gut. Zing rushes outside and Gidyan joins him sticking with his gnomish brother.\n\nThe battle starts to go poorly for the group as the goblin releases the second wolf. Cautiously Zing and Gidyan sneak back into the cave now that the goblin archers are focusing on their friends and open up with spells. Alas all this commotion alerts the occupants of the room beyond that the lair is under attack and three more goblins emerge followed by a large Bugbear armed with a spiked morning star.\n\nThe party manage to down several more goblins and one of the wolves when suddenly Gidyan launches a poorly aimed Sleep spell. Two of the goblins drop to sleep as does Corrin the halfling cleric! Mitch also drops from his wounds and it's up to Bittersweet and the two gnomes to drop the rest of the goblins and the remaining wolf. Trying his best against his much larger foe, Bittersweet fights valiantly but his clubbed into unconsciousness by the bugbear. Zing and Gidyan look at it each other, and run! The bugbear gives chase hurling javelins at the two and scoring hits to both. \nZing is delirious from blood lose but he stands his ground and casts Burning Hands at his much larger foe. When the flash of flame clears there's nothing left but a fowl smelling, burning mound of fur. The two gnomes return inside to revive and awaken their friends, thankfully none have succumbed. Mitch and Bittersweet tuck the sleeping goblins into a more permanent sleep.\n\nIn the remaining room they find Millivent's family and staff in cages and a bald man dressed in black clothing. He explains he's just an adventurer travelling in the area investigating the of dragon black dragon in the area but learnt that it had been since killed, it's treasure taken and its body harvested for parts. The party take what little treasure and salvage weapons the goblins had a leave. They escort the prisoners back to Millivent. She tries to reward the party with coin but Corrin refuses. His companions do not.\n\nThe next day a pouch with a note arrives the inn. It's from the adventurer they rescued from the goblins, it's a pouch with 100gp in gems and a potion of climbing.  The note reads \"Thank you for saving my life, the Zhentarim are in your debt. - Chaab\". Zing is none to please that they just helped an agent of the Black Network.\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 3] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/515y9i/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_3/)**\n",

        "text": "Some things I should mention about my character to you guys before I start: He is a tiefling rogue named Brynn, and my DM and I worked on his background so he could be a bounty hunter, and his main goals are to find a purpose in his life, as he has been abused by nobility and the upper class all of his life for being a tiefling. This is why he resorted to bounty hunting.\n\n\nSo anyway, to the tale, I joined a campaign that is running Curse of Strahd (SPOILERS AHEAD), and after finding Rose and Thorn in Barovia, we decided to check out their house they said was inhabited by monsters.\n\n\n\nAfter finally getting up to the third floor, and defeating the animated armor and broom, our skeleton barbarian named Shade went into the nursery, with our khajit ranger named Bastet and I heading up to the attic.\n\n\nAfter we heard a screech from downstairs, Bastet decided to remain vigilant on the attic stairs while I picked around the rooms. The spectre of one of the maids was murdering Shade in the nursery, when my DM (through very light railroading, which I didn't mind) led me to a door in the attic. I found a defiled grave within a trunk. \n\n\nOnce we realized the corpse was a woman, we made the connection it was the servant who was murdering our poor skeleton friend. We had found a Bless scroll earlier, and I thought using it on the defiled corpse would perhaps help with the situation. After fumbling with the scroll, a sudden burst of divine energy shot out from the scroll. Brynn was shot back into the wall, and suddenly the spirit was in peace, and the corpse disappeared.\n\n\nBrynn, after seeing this miraculous event and speaking with Shade about saving him, Brynn is very interested in the deities of light, Lathander and Helm, and is interested in making his life's purpose protecting and healing the weak with divine power.\n\n\nI just thought I'd share this, as this is the first time a character of mine has had such an impactful change, and it was a really tense but really cool moment in our session. Thank you for reading everyone, and happy gaming! :)\n",

        "text": "Alright, hello there. I was Snidley Whiplash, and now I'm DMing for the wacky campaign. Well, today, I found out what the wacky characters were. But before that, I want to make names for my players:\n\nOD: Original DM. Smart, studies often. Really started this group. DM in last adventure.\n\nOB: OD's Brother. Can be immature at times, but we keep him because he's a good player. Monk Shrek in last adventure.\n\nFG: Fat Guy. OB's best friend, he's 2 years younger than me but he weighs 100 pounds more than me. Paladin Shrek in last adventure.\n\nGF: Great Fighter. Was friends with OD since grade school. Talkative, and really has nothing else to do. Fighter in last adventure.\n\nBB: Best Bro. My best friend. Loves TF2 and plays video games a lot. Super cool. Played Scout last adventure\n\nSG: Skinny Guy. Another one of my friends. He looks like a toothpick, and has a squeaky voice. Nice. Played Pyro last adventure \n\nTH: The Host. He has a big house and he hosts us. He's another one of my friends and introduced me to this group in the first place. Cool, but loves to be the center of attention. Played Soldier last adventure.\n\nOG: Only Girl. GF's girlfriend, since he's the only one here that's above 6/10. Either bipolar, or just a massive b****. \n\nNP: NonPlayer. He's another one of OB's friends who shows up occasionally and just watches. He mains Kirby in SSB4, effing cheater.\n\nAlright, now that that's done, I'll introduce you to the squad of characters they threw together.\n\nGF made \"Captain Pirate\". He's a \"pirate\", despite the fact that he has no idea what a pirate is. He has a pirate ship, which is actually a random mercenary ship that he stole. He drinks so much, he actually starts to hallucinate. He has three crew members, all of which he hallucinates. He is a fighter and has a maul that he named \"Scott\", and it has a face drawn on it, he talks to it like it's a real person.\n\nOD made \"Doctor Wilson\", a rogue that is clearly not a doctor. All it takes is one look at his character sheet to know he's a complete psychopath. He's even CE, for crying out loud.\n\nOB made \"Patrick Star\". He's a Wizard, but all the spells he has are fire. He is quite clearly a pyromaniac. Better double down on fire insurance.\n\nFG made \"Pepe\". I'm not even kidding. He is a \"Frog Person\", and his class was called \"Dank Memer\". Other than that, though, it was a pretty good class.\n\nBB just recycled Scout from last adventure. When I told him he needed a new name because Scout was already the king, he just changed it to \"Blue Scout\".\n\nSG made \"Demoman\" which was a Snidley Whiplash ripoff, except it was a fighter. He even traded all his gear for bombs.\n\nTH made the only serious character, an LG Tiefling Paladin who's name I can't remember.\n\nOG used some random Homebrew site to make a \"Genie\" Druid. I took one look at it and a little part of me dies inside. Racial perks were including, but not limited to:\n\n&gt; being able to cast Wish three times per short rest\n\n&gt; resistance for pretty much any type of damage you'd encounter before level 10\n\n&gt; major boosts in pretty much every stat\n\n&gt; auto-success at Charisma checks and saving throws\n\nThat should just give you an idea about the bull I was dealing with here. Seriously, she wouldn't even need a class and she could take on the full campaign by herself.\n\nI tried to balance it, I.e. get rid of a few racial abilities, and she went into rage mode, yelling about how \"Snidley was OP too!\" and crud like that, even though Snidley gave up all of his gear for his bombs, and she actually got EXTRA gear from her racial perks. After a good 2 hours of arguing, we realized that the time we had was up and we had to go home. I told GF to help OG balance her character.\n\nWell, we meet again next weekend, so let's hope OG has her crud together by then.",

        "text": "In our second session of the campaign, my party at the request of both the Thieves' Guild and the local governance was tracking down a notorious thief known as the Spider. While we were searching for the Spider's base, we rescued a half-elf woman who we belatedly realized could be the Spider and some of us took chase while the others went to talk with a cool dead guy. Since I was a good friend with the necromancer and the bard at the time, I hung out with him while the paladin and the fighter took chase.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the fighter, who was the first one to exit the sewers, couldn't find the suspect and took the logical next step of running after a grandmother and her child, yelling \"WHERE IS SHE?!\". The grandmother ran into a mob of tough guys, and before you know it, a mob formed, chasing our fighter and paladin down. Both of them had taken 12 damage before I was able to intervene.\n\nKrug McKrug was never one for subtlety and I tried to cast fear on the entire mob. I walked up to the edge of the crowd and declared my intent to the DM, rolling the dice for the Wild Magic chance.\n\nObviously, I crit failed, and I rolled again for the effect. I rolled a 08.\n\nI knew what it was before I was able to look at the chart, as I had memorized this particular effect. This casted fireball on myself. So what ended up happening was that I calmly walked up to the crowd and immediately suicidebombed the entire crowd.\n\nSince I was a Half-Orc, I survived at 1 HP (thanks relentless endurance) and no one went after me until my next turn- either they were shocked, injured, dying, or dead. My next turn I immediately ran back into the sewers while 4 people chased me. My DM generously ruled that they were all within 20 feet of each other, so Krug McKrug, the Half-Orc and now arsonist and murderer, continued his killing spree by launching another fireball. He then ran all the way to the edge of the city and escaped through a secret entrance in a tavern, screaming \"The sewer people have attacked! Run for your lives!\" before anyone in the tavern knew what was going on. \n\nAt the end of the day, I became a fugitive, the paladin and the fighter were jailed for assault, and the rest of my party more or less want me dead. I meekly requested my DM to create a new character.\n\nWild magic is a hell of a ride, yo.",

        "text": "My group is currently playing through the first PDF of the Defiance in Phlan series. I will keep the sessions notes updated here for my personal reference as well as to share them with the community. I've enjoyed reading other sessions notes and only to happy to share my own. The party currently includes the following characters:\n\n\n**CORRIN GREENHILL**\n*Male Lightfoot Halfling Cleric of Ilmater*  \nA naive pacifist who is unable to tell a lie.\n\n**GRIMGAR**\n*Male Half-Orc Rogue*  \nOwns a donkey named Horus, a cart and a large chest filled with vampire hunting equipment.\n\n**BROTHER BITTERSWEET**\n*Male Tiefling Monk*  \nA drunkard with an iron shod mug which he uses as a weapon.\n\n**MITCH**\n*Male Mountain Dwarf Fighter*  \nA cobbler who loots bodies in the middle of combat.\n\n**GIDYAN VERSAAD**\n*Male Rock Gnome Sorcerer (Wild Magic)*  \nAn amateur alchemist, historian and tinkerer.\n\n**ZING**\n*Male Rock Gnome Wizard*  \nA pyromaniac with a strong sense of self preservation.\n\n\nBorrowing heavily from [Sagiro's Story Hour](http://stevenac.net/sagiro/StoryHour.htm) I decided to start the party off each receiving a mysterious note from a platinum haired boy. The note read: \n\n*You will appear at Madame Freona’s Tea Kettle in the city of Phlan, at sundown on the first day of Tarsakh, the year 1489DR.  \n- The Paladin*\n\nSo on the appointed day each character (minus Mitch and Grimgar) is magically teleported to Madame Freona’s Tea Kettle in the city of Phlan. Quick introductions are made and one of Madame Freona's daughters approaches the party. She tells them that a chap downstairs \"wishes to exchange gold for an easy job\". At this stage the party also learn that their food and accommodation is being taken care of by \"the Paladin\".\n\nThe party meet with the mysterious cloaked chap and ask if he is \"the Paladin\". He tells them he is not and asks them to deliver a pouch of diamonds to a location known only to him and a seller of a rare red dragon egg. He wants to party to make the exchange and plant a magical pin on the seller which will allow \"his people\" to track the seller back to their lair. At this point Gidyan notices the Harper pin that the mysterious cloaked chap wears. He acknowledges he indeed works for the Harpers and explains the faction's goals. The party are only interested in the 200gp payment for the job.\n\nThe travel to the meeting location, an old barn 20 minutes outside the city of Phlan. The scout out the barn but decide to not investigate the rafters. Zing and Gidyan decide to wait outside and hide while the others wait inside. Bittersweet decides to pose as the buyer since he was told by the mysterious cloaked chap that the seller had not met the buyer as yet. Corrin tries to hide in the barn.\n\nThe seller, a sinewy female elf in grey clothes, arrives with three human body guards. She easily spots the hidden Corrin and asks him to step out. The exchange is quickly made, the pouch of gems for a sack containing a large egg shaped object and the seller leaves. At this point the party remember the magical tracking pin and Gidyan quickly uses a Mage Hand spell to plant the pin on one of the guards. Inside the barn the party check on the red dragon egg.\n\nOutside Zing spots another group approaching the barn, a mean looking half-orc ruffian with his two accomplices. He waits until they are close to the barn then blasts them with Burning Hands. Quickly he ducks into the barn and warns the others. Corrin decides to barricade the barn doors with the handle of his small iron mace. Suddenly two ruffians that were hiding in the rafters open fire on the gathered characters. Zing retaliates with a Fire Bolt catching one of the ruffians in the chest and blowing a hole clear through him. The others rush outside the back of the barn and run off into the woods. Just before closing the back door, Zing fires another Fire Bolt at a pile of hay and runs off cackling into the night.\n\nThe party return to the inn and meet with the mysterious cloaked chap. He takes the egg and takes a small hammer to it. It shatters into the clay forgery that it was. He is satisfied with the party's performance and pays them the agreed sum. He offers them future work with the Harpers but the party ignore him, he leaves. Corrin takes a piece of the \"dragon egg\" shell.\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 2] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/500b92/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_2/)**",

If you haven’t, click here https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4zmtzw/the_sprawl_we_dropped_a_space_elevator_on_god/ to get caught up. If not, please enjoy reading about our misadventures!\n\nWe Dropped a Space Elevator on God; a Storytime in 5-ish Parts\n\nEpisode 1: Tate Green AKA The Time We Learned Throwing Grenades Indoors Was a Bad Idea\n\nOur story begins (for real this time) at Nacivo Headquarters, which isn’t too far from the University of Alberta. Noose’s direct superior, Mrs. Parker, called her to board room 12a to discuss her next assignment. The corporation’d caught wind of all the under the table stuff she’d been up to, but instead of firing her they decided to make use of her connections.\n\nShe tells Noose that the former star quarterback of the Edmonton Executives (former meaning, like, two decades ago) was attacked at a press conference in Calgary a few days ago, and since he’s basically been the poster boy for Nacivo biomods for the last twenty years, that won’t do. Because of Tate’s reputation with the company, however, it can’t look like the corp is messing with the investigation, so Parker asks Noose to build a team not associated with Nacivo to find out who wants him dead.\n\nNoose calls Turkish, who brings in Gill (fairly easily considering he’s passed out on his bar (at 12:00 PM)) and Paul (who’s first response despite Mrs. Parker’s most descriptive feature being her indescribability is “she single?” Fucking hell Paul.) Despite their vested interest in the operation, Nacivo gave the team very little to work with, the dicks, so the group goes to their only real lead: Tate Green’s apartment.\n\n*\n\nTate Green lives in this swanky apartment on the south side, and walking in you could instantly tell this guy was an athlete. Whatever surface wasn’t being taken up by the support systems for his biomods was covered in layers upon layers of sports memorabilia. Turkish was in love. See, unbeknownst to anyone else, Turkish was actually Tate’s biggest admirer back in the day (leading to some pointed questions about how old the Merry Man was vs. how he looked, especially considering he was a purist.)\n\nWe needed a way to gather information but Green wasn’t having any of it. I have no idea how this guy was ever a professional football player because talking to him now, even roided out as he is on mods, he was the biggest pansy imaginable, coming up with the most ridiculous excuses to be unhelpful despite the fact that we were clearly the people the corporation he’s payed to make look good sent to solve his problems. God. We needed some angle we could work, or at least a way to keep him busy while we scoped out his mods and did some... “research”. Turkish was maybe a bit *too* eager to be the distraction, but whatever. So while Turkish was busy gushing over Tate and his career, Paul and Gill got busy cross-referencing their archives to find out who might want to hurt Green and Noose took a more intimate (read: privacy invading) look at his gear.\n\nHere’s what we all learned: Gill and Paul found that Green had been involved in a cheating scandal back in the day. Specifically, people suspected him of having used an undeclared biomod near the pinnacle of his career. In passing, Turkish managed to get Tate to let slip the name of the cop who’d interviewed him after the attack (some guy named Ryan Fitzpatrick.) Finally, Noose managed to corroborate Paul and Gill’s findings because, as she was sizing up Tate’s implants, she noticed evidence of a synthetic nerve hub in the back of his neck, just barely visible under his skin. Specifically, this mod didn’t look like anything Nacivo provided. It wasn’t clear who made it, but he definitely got it somewhere else. We didn’t chew him out on it (I think the guy would have died of a heart attack if we called him out on his not-so-secret cheating device) but something bigger was going on.\n\nSo with that, off we went to our next destination. See, thanks to some string pulling and corporate bullshit, jurisdiction of the investigation had gotten transferred over from the police department where Tate was attacked to the one where he lived. So, thanks to our glorious corporate overlords, Detective Fitzpatrick worked in the 37th precinct here in Mill Woods. CONVENIENCE! So instead of an hour trip on the maglev to Calgary, we took a fifteen-minute drive down the street to the police station.\n\n*\n\nThe Station’s your average underfunded mildly corrupt law enforcement office. Guys running around with hands full of paper, angry looking folks going in and out of what looked like interrogation rooms, bored looking desk cops talking with little granny down the street about why it’s wrong to savagely mug people in the street at 75. The usual. Despite this, however, we managed to get a hold of Ryan Fitzpatrick pretty easily. He, thank the stars, turned out to be *leagues* more helpful than Monsieur Green and answered all of our questions like a decent and helpful human being. Well, he was to Turkish at least, seeing as how the Merry Men were the police’s sortof allies to keep the streets clean of all the abominations Lapti Nek were cooking up, in exchange for turning a blind eye to the extortion and the violence and the cronyism and the whatever other illegal shit the Merry Men were up to these days.\n\nSo, apparently, we were right on the whole secret biomod conspiracy thing. The police had long suspected Green of having illicitly acquired mods to give him an edge in his sport. But who? Nacivo seemed like a good candidate, but Noose was adamant that they only provided Green with mods to get him back on his feet after a career ending car accident two decades ago. They, according to her, have a pretty strict anti-doping policy. Regardless, that nerve hub was too crude to look like Nacivo tech. The more likely, and worrisome, suspicion was that Tate Green had gotten mixed up with Lapti Nek. But why would they wait this long to take him out if that was their goal? \n\nGreen had apparently been associating with one particularly nasty Lapti Nek enforcer, a guy named Shark. Noose and Gill instantly perked up when Fitzpatrick mentionned that name. To Gill, Shark’s the guy who traumatised Coleen, and he doesn’t take kindly to people fucking with his girlfriend. To Noose, Shark is the one that got away after he robbed her lab at Nacivo HQ. If you want to know what Shark looks like, think Jarred Leto, but give him Titanium teeth, gills, metal bones, and muscles that’d make an Olympic weight lifter second-guess his life decisions. Oh, and the attitude of a British school yard bully for good measure. Lastly, we also learned that among other things, a small dart was found not too far from the crime scene, and trajectory analysis confirmed it had narrowly missed Green. Paul was the first to pipe up.\n“Duh, they’re trying kill him like secret agent style, poison darts are pretty legit.”\n\nBut then we were reminded that all four of Green’s bodyguards were gunned down pretty mercilessly during the attack. If Lapti Nek wanted him dead, why didn’t they just shoot him?\n\n“Because they never wanted to kill him, we’re looking at a kidnapping!” \nsays Noose. Then a long silence at the sudden realization. Gill breaks it,\n\n“Which means they might try again.” And with that, almost by magic, Noose’s phone rings. It wasn’t a person. Instead it was an automatic message from Tate Green’s apartment, wired through Nacivo, with a robotic voice saying security had been breached. We could hear gunfire in the background. Great. Did I also mention it was rush hour?\n\n*\n\nWe ended up taking Cargo the worm back from the police station, a fact which Paul was much too excited for. While Noose was at home psychically driving her equivalent of a vat grown truck, and Gill and Turkish were by no means excited to ride around in the gut of something out of Dune, being inside the moist innards of a giant worm with his crush pleased Paul in a way that made the rest of us more than a bit uncomfortable. To make matters worse, Turkish ended up getting a phone call partway through the ride from Det. Fitzpatrick, saying that the station was suddenly *also* under attack. Decisions had to be made about who to save and whatnot. We ended up settling on this: Noose would drop the boys off at the apartments and call Hunter in to give them support while she doubled back to the police station with Cargo.\n\nSo after a few phone calls we had a decent amount of backup to help us storm the castle. Turkish got a whole lot of his guys over, and Hunter was already there making the Merry Men nervous. The doors to the apartment were already busted open and the lobby evacuated so at least we didn’t need to worry about collateral. Despite the emergency situation, Tate lived in the penthouse and no one felt like climbing the stairs, so everyone crammed into the elevator and up we went.\n\nWe were about 2 floors from the top when Hunter (controlled by Noose) stopped the elevator. Somewhat confused, everyone got off and followed the animal off. Noose was till just within controlling range, so she briefly possessed her pet to scratch “LOTS OF GUYS, DON’T USE LIFT” into the wallpaper for the others to see. Instead of instilling caution in them, it started to give them ideas. The group took the biggest grenade they could get their hands on, suspended it in front of the elevator door via duct tape and belts, slapped as many more grenades as they could onto it, and sent the thing two floors up.\n\nWhen we got to the penthouse, the elevator had no doors. There were some Lapti Nek goons in there, probably guys from further down trying to figure out what happened. Gill blew one guys head off while Hunter ripped out the other’s vocal cords.\n\nAlong with bloody, the entire hallway was also blackened, burning, and riddled with holes. Gill smiled, so were the bodies. The boom’d easily taken out half a dozen, and a few more were crushed further down the hallway under the two large slabs of metal that used to be the doors. \n\n*\n\nMeanwhile, Noose had just arrived at the 37th precinct. To say it looked a little worse than it did an hour ago was an understatement. Apparently the cops here *really* sucked if they got obliterated that fast. The door was wide open and there was no one at reception, so our intrepid scientist used the incredibly advanced technique of using the front entrance. It didn’t stay empty for long, though, as a guard came right around the bend before she had time to look at anything. She ducked under the desk and thankfully he didn’t see her. Then a thought crept across her mind. She was a scientist, not a soldier or spy; she didn’t stand a chance sneaking into this place.\n\nCursing under her breath, she tucked her Nacivo ID under her shirt and used her elbow to bump the desk. She heard the clicking of a rifle and an inhumanly deep voice.\n\n“You’d better come out now.”\n\nNoose made her best scared employee impression,\n\n“Don’t hurt me please, I’m just a receptionist.” She replied as she slowly stood up from under the desk, hands up. The guy sized her up through glowing cat’s eyes. He scoffed and, saying nothing, lumbered towards her and grabbed her by the shoulder.\nAs the goon escorted her through the police station, Noose set her neural implant to record everything that she saw. The station was crawling with men and women who were unmistakably Lapti Nek. Chrome clashed with mutated flesh on their largely exposed skin, the ones that looked more important seemed to have quality cyberwear and biomods installed, while the less lucky ones had body parts crudely replaced. One guy even had a whole tiger leg sewn onto his stomach, which he was using to hold up his comically oversized gun. Where he got it and how it was still functional were questions that intrigued and horrified Noose in equal measure. \n\nIn the various interrogation rooms, she saw apparently important officers of the 37th precinct being “questioned”, and she made sure to get a very good look at their interrogators. No sign of Fitzpatrick though. Additionally, she also saw nestled in a briefcase on a desk what she could only assume was the dart that had been used in the attack on Tate Green.\n\nNoose was finally lead into a storage room at the end of the hallway. Her escort shoved her into the room, locking the door behind her. The guard inside rose from her chair and trained her gun on Noose, but soon lowered it when she decided the so-called receptionist was harmless. She ordered Noose to sit down with the other hostages. Sure enough, Noose wasn’t by herself, because it looked like any staff that weren’t being actively interrogated were being kept here. They looked thoroughly beaten.\n\nNoose took a seat and laughed to herself. The goons hadn’t even bothered to tie her thumbs. She scanned the room until her eyes finally rested on a humanoid shape lying face down on the ground. He was bloodied, bruised, and it looked like he had cybernetic arms… or used too. The stumps made it look like they’d chewed off. Besides that, though, he was still breathing; Detective Fitzpatrick was alive.\n\n*\n\nBack at the Green apartment, the boys were standing in front of the door to Tate’s place trying to figure out what to do. Hunter’s wonder nose had told them that there were either spooky scary skeletons or very bad men on the other side of that door (with Noose out of range, his charades game wasn’t very strong.) Mean goons was probably the right answer though, and putting his cyberears to the wall, Gill could hear what sounded like a couple of Dudes hanging out and standing guard.\n\nWe ended up sending Hunter up through the vents to act as a scout, which ended with the poor cat-dog-fish falling out of the vents with all the grace of a cat that just saw a cucumber. The dudes from the front and the ones in the back trying to get into Green’s panic room came running. Hearing the commotion, Gill kicked down the door, and everyone who was out in the hallway piled into the apartment. Everyone just kind of looked at everyone else for a second and no one really knew what was going on. Then the shooting started. TL;DR: Massive Clusterfuck.\n\nThe fight was surprisingly easy. These guys were less like trained professionals and more like hired guns. Hell, they didn’t even have any freaky Lapti Nek mods, just decent guns and maybe a little bit of chrome. Whoever didn’t get dragged away by Hunter or had their head blown off by Gil got their ass dogpiled by the Merry Men. It got really bad after one of Turkish’s guys got killed. The Men that were left absolutely unloaded on the goons. I’d never seen an area get cleared so fast. We had the last of the guys surrounded in the living room, but then Paul had a brilliant idea as to how to get rid of them. He takes one of his grenades—a Bob-Omb amiibo— and lobs it into the middle of the group. Again, he threw a *grenade* indoors, in crowded *luxury* apartment full of *REALLY EXPENSIVE THINGS*!\n\nThe good news is that he took out the rest of the bad guys. The bad news is that he ended up blowing a massive hole in the floor, damaged priceless medical equipment, and destroyed thousands of dollars in sports memorabilia. By the end of the fight, we couldn’t tell if Turkish was crying for his lost man or at the complete annihilation of a temple to the sport of football. Well, at least Tate was safe.\n\nSpeaking of the guy we were supposed to protect, he was still locked in his little panic room. So while Gill and Turkish ran around trying to cover up the mess he made, Paul wandered over to the big metal door that was very poorly hidden behind a painting of Mr. Green and knocked.\n\n“Hey… uh… we killed all the guys. You can come out now.”\n\nThere was no response.\n\n“Dude, it’s me, Paul.”\n\nStill nothing. Paul shoots the door, but the bullet ricochets off and onto a little suitcase by one of the bodies. After finding the key in one of the guy’s pockets, Paul opens it to find a syringe full of purple goo. His reporter instincts must have kicked in, because in an act of genuine intelligence and foresight, Paul took the syringe and held onto it for later.\n\nIn the living room, Gill and Turkish had decided that the apartment was a lost cause. They’d tried everything to conceal the damages the explosion had done, but the burn marks wouldn’t come out. The Merry Men had no idea how to fix complex corporate technology, and the carpet they’d use to cover up the hole in the floor just ended up falling through. They were about to conduct a complex and intricate operation to retrieve said carpet, but then Turkish got a phone call.\n\n*\n\nNoose’s objectives were twofold: 1. Get the cops out of the station and 2. Get that dart. Being not all that confident in her boxing and not having her patented murder machine Hunter nearby meant that there were *way* more goons in the station than she could hope to take on by herself. She was going to need to get crafty. Another benefit of not having been searched was that she still had the gas grenades she kept in case she ever lost control of Hunter hidden away in her coat. They were old and kind of crusty, but they’d do. Under her breath, she whispers a few heckles to get the guard’s attention.\n\n“The fuck’d you say?” the guard barked as she stomped towards Noose.\n\n“So sorry, let me try again: D’you just like the butch hair or is your boyfriend that into guys?” \n\n“D’you want to say that again?!” Says the guard, picking the little scientist up by the collar. The guard saw something round in Noose’s hand, there was a hissing noise, then black.\n\nNoose was reeling from the gas. Even if she’d aimed it right in the guard’s face, there was no way she’d avoid breathing a little in if she was that close. The room went blurry for a few seconds, and she could swear she could hear a phone ringing for a few minutes afterwards, but other than that she was fine. Onto phase two.\n\nShe pulls out a small device resembling a long dog whistle with a sharp end, plants it into the ground, and blows into it. A few moments later, a man sized fleshy tube emerges from the ground; Cargo’s boarding canal. A little coercion later and all of the captive cops go down the tube and into Cargo. Awesome! Just as she was starting to think her precinct adventure would be a perfect 10, there was a knock at the door.\n\n“Hey, is everything alright in there?” Well shit. Noose immediately grabbed the downed guard’s chair and shoved it under the door handle. That’d buy her some time. She helped the last of the staff into Cargo and made a pretty painful choice. She could stay and try to go for the dart, but the situation was about to get really fucked really fast. Besides, without her to pilot Cargo, the staff were stuck here. There was a loud bang and holes appeared in the door where the first shotgun shells had pierced it. The dart would have to wait until some other day. She hopped down the boarding canal, neurally linked up with her giant worm, and drove the hell out of there. \n\n*\n\nOnce she got was far away enough to deem safe, she dropped off the police staff at the nearest hospital and gave Turkish a phone call.\n“Hey Noose, everything alright?” He asked, using his free hand to anchor Gill as he lowered a Merry Man down the hole to retrieve the carpet.\n\n“Well, when I got to the station Lapti Nek had already trashed the place. Oh, and I lost the dart.”\n\n“What?” He lost his grip, sending Gill and the poor gangster flying down into the apartment below. Noose recapped what had just happened. “Well… uh… shit. Things went about as well on our end.” He replied, doing the same for Noose. Just then Paul caught a glimpse of what was going on.\n\n“Oh my god is that Noose?” He wrestles the phone from Turkish. “Hi Noooooooose.” There was a click on the other end.\n\nAfter wrestling the phone back from Paul, Turkish managed to get Noose back on the line. After peering into the hole to get Gil’s opinion, the team agreed to meet back at Nacivo HQ.\n\n*\n\nAfter a bit of deliberation, the group decided that they could *probably* call mission complete and go bug Parker for payment. I mean, they did manage to find out that it was Lapti Nek after Tate Green, that they wanted to kidnap him, that it was likely to discredit Nacivo in some way, and they managed to fight off another kidnapping attempt. They even had proof that the fight at the Green apartment was another attempt and not simply a hit because the purple goo the goons were apparently going to inject Green with was revealed to be, after a quick analysis from Noose, designed to disable cyberwear and biomods, rendering someone who depended on them like Green temporarily incapacitated. On top of that, they saved (and therefore indebted to Nacivo) a whole police station from angry Lapti Nek grunts trying to destroy the evidence. Sure we lost the dart, but we did save the case’s lead detective, which had to mean something. Plus, we even had a recording proving it was Lapti Nek that did it, which the corporation could find some sort of use for.\n\nSo, *decently* sure of themselves, up the group went to see Mrs. Parker.\nWhen they got to Parker’s office, however, instead of a nondescript woman in a black suit and sunglasses, they were greeted by a nondescript *man* in a black suit and sunglasses. Noose barely recognized him.\n\n“Mr. Parker?” She asks, “What are you doing here? Isn’t your sister overseeing this assignment?”\n\n“I’ve been wondering the same thing. It seems as though she went missing shortly after your meeting yesterday,” he responded. We couldn’t see his eyes behind his shades, but we could definitely feel him judging our motley crew with every second he felt we were worth his gaze. “But that’s above your paygrade. I assume you wish to speak about your current job?”\n\nNoose began to open her mouth.\n\n“No need, it’s all over the news. You’d better have something good to tell me.”\n\nAnd with that the negotiations began. Between ass kissing from Noose, threats from Gill, bullshitting from Turkish, and promises of good publicity from Paul, we managed to convince Parker to pay us. After the cheques had been written and hands shaken, Parker opened his mouth one more time.\n\n“Between who this Shark person is, why Lapti Nek is moving against us, and my sister’s sudden disappearance, your story still leaves many unanswered questions. Questions this corporation wants answered. Keep in touch kids, Nacivo may have more work for you soon.”\n\n*\n\nThe air is thick and hot. The room smells like fish. Accompanying the sound of a distant river, there is the percussive sounds of flesh and bone pounding against meat. Through the darkness of the room, the outline of a large man punching a large heavy object dangling from a meat hook. In the dim light, another man becomes visible.\n\n“Mr. Shark, sir.” The large man stops punching. “The attack on the 37th precinct was a success, we managed to secure and destroy evidence linking us to the Green incident in Calgary.” \n\nThe large man laughs. “Good.”\n\n“There were… uh… complications. The detective, he got away before we could interrogate him… along with everyone in the station.” The large man’s smile fades, his face is expressionless. “And to make matters worse, someone stopped our attempts to capture Tate Green in his apartment. He’s since been moved to a secure location.”\n\nThe large man pauses, then turns around, still stone-faced. He walks up to the speaker, casting a shadow over him. He grins with big titanium teeth and ruffles the other man’s hair like a child.\n\n“Heh, interesting. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.” The large man cracks his neck, then his back, then leaves. The other man follows after him.\n\nWith the large man gone, the object he was punching is more clearly visible. The swinging thing isn’t a thing at all, but a person. Skewered through the abdomen by a meat hook, the body of Mrs. Parker limply dangles in the air.",

        "text": "To whom it may concern: This story contains adult language. Without further ado:\n\nWe Dropped a Space Elevator on God; a Storytime in 5-ish Parts\n\nEpisode 0: The Cast AKA Who the hell are these People? I Was Promised Space Elevators!\n\nThis is a record of an excellent Sprawl campaign me and my Drama buddies spent the last few months playing. The Sprawl’s this cyberpunk as-noire-as-you-want-it DungeonWorld-like game and it’s amazing, check it out! So, for those of you who haven’t played The Sprawl before, when a new game is started, everyone sits down and creates the setting collaboratively, with each player and the GM creating an all powerful corporation that the game centers around. We then create our characters and decide \n\n1. How they all know each other and\n\n2. A previous job they’ve done in which they’ve interacted with one or more corporations (usually by fucking them over.)\n\nHere’s what we came up with:\n\nThe Setting: [Clears Throat] Our story is set in the now sprawling city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The year is 2096, and the city has evolved into a downtown core slum with spires dotting the skyline swallowed by an endless expanse of suburbs. The whole thing is then bisected by a network of parks and river valleys collectively known as “Eden.” At the heart of the city is a massive space elevator, the largest of its kind, granting trade access to the now colonized and terraformed Mars.\n\nThe Corps:\n\nNacivo Environmental: Focuses on environmental renewal and clean energy solutions. Supplies power to the city, maintains Eden, and runs the largest genetic engineering program in the country.\n\nMetro News: Yup, even in the gunky sprawls of 2096, there are still poor sods dressed in green handing out these damned newspapers. Nobody quite knows how they’ve done it, but they’ve become the most important player in Edmonton’s journalism industry.\n\nLapti Nek: Mutant Mafia specializing in the harmonization of cyberwear (slang for cybernetic augmentations) and gene-mods (AKA Bio-mods, slang for genetic/biological augmentations.) Also a doomsday cult. Also run by douchebags.\n\nBioWare Arms:  After ultimately folding as a game studio in the wake of the UN ban of the AAA industry, the studio became a weapons manufacturer assembling the weapons in their games. Which means, yes, there was a lightsaber hidden somewhere in the campaign. Spoiler: We never found it, pretty sure the final boss swallowed it at some point.\n\nRe/Max: Fucked off somewhere, apparently, because they didn’t do shit the entire game despite being the richest of the five and owning the space elevator.\n\nAnd now for what you probably came here to see, the characters:\n\nTurkish: Our Fixer, runs a gang called the Merry Men who are literally Robin Hood &amp; Co., gangster edition. Basically run Mill Woods (a suburb district where everyone’s an immigrant) out of a bar called The Mill.  He’s also a member of the “Purity Movement,” which advocates abstinence from the use of cyberwear, and is uncertain of the ethics of bio-mods. Oh, and he’s not Turkish at all, he’s, like, East Asian. Gill (PC) is frequent patron of his bar and runs a hefty tab. Paul (PC) has had a running deal with the Merry Men to keep their less than legal exploits out of the papers. His leader, Robin, has interacted with Nacivo through their representative, Noose (PC), who even gave him a bio-mod under the table.\n\nGill: Our deadbeat Hunter. A loner and an alcoholic (and patron of The Mill), he’s real sunshine and lollipops material. He’s a damned good PI though, despite his obsession with his PTSD girlfriend, Coleen. His most notable feature is how nondescript his nondescript sedan is. He also speaks in an overly grizzled voice that would make Scruff McGruff proud, which his player actually managed to pull off whenever he opened his mouth. He uses Paul’s newspapers to dispose of bodies and bring Noose “materials” (and sometimes he’ll read an article or two.)\n\nPaul: Our “Reporter”. That feeling when one of your players is https://1d4chan.org/wiki/This_Guy but his character is https://1d4chan.org/wiki/That_guy, that’s Paul. Fuck him. He’s a fat neckbeard weeaboo who lives surrounded by his extensive vintage amiibo collection and spends his evenings watching shitty anime until his eyes roll back and his spine slides out of his anus (bonus points if you get that reference.) A world renowned authority on Creepypasta, he holds the world-record for a speedrun of Sonic.exe, which he attempted to prove his “edginess.” Oh yeah, and I guess he sometimes does some decent reporting for the Metro. He’s never seen without his comically overlarge fedora, “cool” trenchcoat, anime tee, and ninety something year old orange gamecube controller in the back pocket of his khakis in case he needs to play Melee (he never does.) His work’s been read by all the characters, and he has this creepy crush on Noose, having asked for just a few too many interviews before crossing from dodgy reporter over into creepy stalker. Again, fuck this guy.\n\nAudette “Noose” Van Beuren: Our Tech. A young doctor of genetics and aspiring mad scientist, Nacivo basically owns her. She doesn’t mind, though, considering she’s their biggest cheerleader. She has three abominations… um… “pets” that are neurally linked to her: Radar, A chipmunk-bat, Hunter, a whatever the hell this thing is http://i.imgur.com/e9ooxRK.png, and Cargo, a literal Thresher Maw she uses to get around town. When she’s not committing crimes against nature, she boxes at a club downtown. Also, she’s adorable; short, blond, thin, freckled, and wears her hair in two long pigtails dyed orange and blue shaped like DNA helixes. She’s implanted a gene-mod in Robin, Turkish’s gang leader, been hit on by the creeper Paul despite numerous attempts to tell him she likes women, and has used Gil as her personal Igor to procure body parts and DNA samples from less than reputable sources.\n\nSo that’s the cast, and all the setup I need to do before we get started! We originally had more people, including a Driver and a Killer, but because of a scheduling nightmare we had to take a size reduction. So, because of that, we went from a generally well-rounded and well-balanced team to a bunch of nerds that could come up with a really great plan but couldn’t execute it worth a damn. Anyways, join us next time for Episode 1: Tate Green AKA The Time We Found Out Throwing Grenades Indoors Was a Bad Idea.\n\nNext time is apparently right now though, so moving on: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4zmzey/the_sprawl_we_dropped_a_space_elevator_on_god/\n",

        "text": "Hello again! Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThis is a continuation of the previous tale '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 9', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4xhmpa/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Last time, our lawless desperados managed to evade capture by the forces of Pinnacle. Diving into the sewers, they utilised Patterdemalions telekinetic abilities to open a passageway through the tunnels and make their way through the cordon. Rising up into an abandoned costume shop, the group encountered Electric Boogaloo: A creature composed of pure electricity that was possessing a store mannequin. Tensions rose until violence broke out. Managing to drive away the creature, and seal up the sewers behind it, the super-villains spent some time formulating a plan. Event Horizon contacted the Resistance while Kitsune proposed his scheme: Infiltrate and claim one of the Zel'tan capital vessels for use against Pinnacle. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\n\"I just want to go on record that this is a terrible idea.\" Pilot spoke with the aggrieved tone one might expect of the only reasonable person in a group of teenagers instead of someone co-opted into a suicide mission. He was ignored, much to his chagrin, as the rest of the team continued to plan.\n\n\"If the mother-ships are anything like that prison vessel we hit, there should be access points here and here.\" Event Horizon pointed them out on the rough diagram they had sketched out. \"We could always just blast our way into the main hanger but I think that might fuck the element of surprise.\" Minato hummed in assent, stroking his chin contemplatively. The con-man finally shook his head with a growl.\n\n\"No. We wouldn't gain anything from a frontal assault, even with the Zel'tan under my command. Commander, care to help us out here?\" He turned to the leader of the Resistance, standing off of his shoulder with a blank look in her eyes. Even Patterdemalion cringed as life returned to her vacuous form and she began to speak as if she had been part of the conversation the entire time. \n\n\"I agree. No matter how good you are, we don't know what's waiting for you inside. A direct assault would only lead to unnecessary deaths. If we do this, we do it quickly and quietly.\" She swept a hand across the map until her hand fell on a crudely drawn hatch. \"This is so obvious that it must be a trap: You leave a hole in your defences, small enough that it would be difficult to spot but not impossible. Once the enemy takes the bait, you spring the trap.\" Kitsune winced self-consciously; he had been proud of himself in locating the potential flaw in Pinnacle's fortifications. \"The other hatch will be exactly the same, I wager.\" \n\n\"Perhaps we could simply sneak aboard?\" Patters finally pipped up, his demonic visage scrunched up in concentration. Minato had been surprised that the imp continued to offer them his aid but the help was appreciated. \"How did you breach the prison vessel?\" The surviving villains looked at each other uneasily, remembering the puddle that Barghast left when he died.\n\n\"Safe to say that it's not an option anymore.\" Event Horizon hummed as a rare contemplative look crossed his face. \n\n\"Maybe we're overthinking this. Pilot, any idea if those Talons have some kind of Friend-or-Foe programming?\" Pilot sighed and turned to one of the many glassy-eyed Zel'tan, steeling himself for the conversation to come. They had discovered that the lizard-men were, to put it politely, roughly of the same intelligence that one might attribute to a brain-damaged puppy dog. How Pinnacle had programmed them to perform such tasks as piloting incredibly advanced aircraft and operating long range flamethrowers, none of the group could fathom. Event Horizon kept talking, more to hear the sound of his own voice than anything. \"If they do, then is there any reason that we can't just fly one of the damn things in there?\" \n\nSilence reigned over the impromptu war council as they considered the possibility of such a simple plan actually working. Minato raised a hand and opened his mouth to speak, though no words came out. All of his schemes amounted to the same thing: They all died in a glorious but futile assault on a floating fortress without ever even seeing their actual enemy. If Event Horizon came up with a plot that got them a little closer to Pinnacle, then who was Kitsune to object. With a little small talk being made among the team, time passed until Pilot returned with an aggravated growl.\n\n\"I hate those fucking things. There's so much tactical knowledge crammed into their tiny brains and I can't even begin extracting it. Long story short, yes. The Talons have a rudimentary F.I.F system that should get us into the Capital Ship without any issue.\" His gloved fist was twitching violently, trigger finger clenching around a non-existent weapon. The mercenary operative took a steadying breath before continuing. \"So, what was your plan.\" \n\nMinutes later, a single Talon soared through the skies. Others of it's kind, accompanied by jet-black V-TOLs, paid it no mind. The Talon began to drift upward in an easy approach to it's target: The Capital Ship hovering above New York City. The trip itself was a picture of serenity. The inside of the Talon, not so much.\n\n\"This is so fucking stupid. We're going to die.\" Event Horizon grumbled quietly to himself, being shushed yet again by the rest of the crew. The interior of their vehicle was cramped: A dozen Zel'tan shock troopers stood patiently in the deployment bay, their mammoth frames bumping into the significantly smaller forms of Minato and his coterie. The humans were being squished against the cold hull by their mindless foot soldiers, a situation that did not sit well with any of them. Event Horizon shoved a Zel'tan off of him with a growl, receiving a short-lived snarl in return. \"Have I mentioned recently how much I hate this plan?\" \n\n\"Nine times in the last six minutes. Shut up.\" Pilot piped up from his unfortunate position, sandwiched between two of the scaly saurians. Minato grinned in return, having found himself mercifully free of smothering. Event Horizon continued to grumble until Kitsune commanded one of the Zel'tan to smack him. The speedster glared over at him, rubbing his sore cranium.\n\n\"It was your idea anyway, you idiot. Stop complaining about it and get ready.\" Minato earned a lewd gesture in return. The reptilian pilot hissed out that they were docking now, prompting the strike team to ready up. Moments after the Talon gently dropped to the hanger floor, the assault force exploded into motion: Zel'tan dropped free from the vessel and unleashed devastating gouts of flame while Event Horizon rocketed out of the transportation module. Pilot emerged with his Ultra-violet cannon seconds later, Patters creating a telekinetic shield for the both of them. Kitsune was the last to vacate the landed Talon, desperately hoping that things had gone their way. He certainly did not expect what awaited him.\n\n\"Where the hell is everyone?\" Event Horizon paced anxiously, his vibrating form humming like a hive of murderous wasps. The hanger bay was completely devoid of movement or life. Dozens, if not hundreds, of inactive Talons lay across the bay in perfect rows yet there was a conspicuous absence of hostile lifeforms. \"Remember how I said this was a bad plan? I take it back.\" The caffeine addict spun his staff with a speed and precision that would make a circus performer green with jealousy. \"This is a fucking shitty plan and we're all going to die.\" No-one silenced him this time, each of them unnerved by the situation. Patters tried to calm everyone's nerves.\n\n\"Perhaps they're simply all terrestrially bound, hunting us?\" The diminutive demon had a hint of apprehension in his tone. Pilot chirped back immediately, his weapon following the sights of his rifle.\n\n\"Or they're laying in wait, prepared to ambush us.\" Finding himself on the receiving end of several impressive death glares, the mercenary amended his statement. \"As an example. I mean, the entire crew might have been deployed to track us down thus leaving one of their most valuable assets completely unguarded. Sounds like acceptable operating procedure.\" His voice was thick with sarcasm. Kitsune pinched his nose in response before barking out orders.\n\n\"Alright, enough chit-chat. Whatever the case, we're here now and we might as well get the job done. Event Horizon, scout ahead but keep within communication range. Everyone else form up as a perimeter around Patters, Pilot and I.\" The Zel'tan shifted into a loose phalanx around their commander, moving in the eerie unison that Minato's puppets always did. The con-man's declaration was firm, his voice sharp as steel. \"Let's see what we find.\" \n\nThe ramshackle team progressed cautiously, Event Horizon sweeping each room and corridor before allowing them to move on. This vessel was significantly larger than their previous conquest, though they at least knew which direction to head in for the bridge. The only sounds were those of their marching and the oscillation of the giant fans occupying the intersections. By the time that the group had reached their halfway point, they had yet to see a single soul or genetically modified killing machine: The chitinous corridors were completely devoid of motion or life. The longer they continued without contact, the more apprehensive the group became. It was only after passing through yet another identical corridor that Minato realised something.\n\n\"Wait, wait. Didn't we have twelve Zel'tan?\" His question was met with a snort of ridicule from Pilot, the mercenary continuing to sweep left and right.\n\n\"Did you just learn to count? Yes, we have twelve lizard people.\" He stopped, realisation hitting him. \"Now we have ten...\" Minato glared at the freelancer in irritation.\n\n\"That's what I was saying, you ass-hat. How did we lose two giant killing machines?\" It was Patters who answered, facing forward with wide eyes. \n\n\"Five.\" The bickering duo turned to him questioningly. \"We've lost five. The vanguard is smaller than it was.\" Sure enough, the formation's arrowhead had devolved into a vaguely defined square of protection. The Zel'tan pressed closer together, shielding their commander from whatever threat may come. It was as scaled bodies closed in around him, Minato felt a gust of wind behind him. Spinning on his heel, the con-man noted the conspicuous absence of his rearguard. With only four Zel'tan remaining, the atmosphere took on a distinctly frightful quality. Event Horizon had yet to return and insidious thoughts were beginning to worm their way into the team's heads.\n\n\"We need to figure out what's hitting us. This horror-movie shit's getting old fast.\" Minato snarled, trying to project anger instead of fear. Patters giggled manically, his wings beating a frantic tempo.\n\n\"Horror movies were actually why my brother and I were summoned to this realm by the director. I must admit, this certainly feels like one of his tales.\" There was the faintest sensation of something moving past them and the trio were alone. Zel'tan ichor stained the floor around them, leaving the team safe inside a perfect circle of sterility amidst the carnage. Throat suddenly dry, Minato put a hand on Pilot's shoulder and pointed weakly down the corridor. The mercenary followed the path of his shaky finger down the corridor before stopping on a solitary figure. The woman, as it so obviously was, watched them with a predatory air. More concerning was the long blade held lightly in one hand. \n\n\"Uh...hello? Did you happen to see where our lizard-folk went?\" The question was a half-hearted one from Minato but it drew an answer: The woman curtsied with a flourish, her sword slowly dripping viscera into a pool on the floor. \"Oh. That's...that's lovely. Would you mind standing down and leaving?\" The woman shook in silent laughter before assuming a familiar sprinter's stance. \"Is it just me or does she look like...\" He was cut off as she vanished, reappearing at the other end of the corridor. Pilot's weapon split in half and his helmet shattered as if struck by an extreme force. \"Fuck me, she's a speedster!\" Minato wind-milled in place violently before jamming a finger against his comm-link. \"Get back here, you bastard! We need you.\" \n\nOne of the walls was torn asunder in a flurry of motion as Event Horizon exploded through it. The two speedsters battled each other in a whirlwind of violence, sparks erupting across the corridor from their clashes. There was a collision that sent the two of them skidding across the passageway, leaving twisted metal in their wake. \n\n\"So, who the hell is this and why does she move like me?\" Without waiting for a response, the woman turned and disappeared. \"Where the fuck are you going? Where the fuck is she going? Get back here!\" Event Horizon growled furiously, chasing after his wayward opponent. It was only seconds later that he returned, brows furrowed in aggravation. \"The little gutter slag gave me the slip. I'd be impressed if I wasn't so pissed off.\" His grudging statement was accompanied by a vicious strike to the wall, crumpling part of it. Minato leaned against what precious little hallway remained and breathed deeply before speaking.\n\n\"Alright. Pinnacle has a speedster. That's...really quite bad. Any idea who she is?\" Event Horizon thought for a moment before shaking his head.\n\n\"There aren't that many of us and none that look like that or use a fucking sword. Goddamn LARPing pissant...\" Pilot finally spoke up, tossing aside the fractured remnants of his weapon.\n\n\"Whoever she is, she's dangerous.\" He preempted the flow of 'No shit' with a raised hand. \"I don't mean because she's fast, though she's really damn fast. I mean because she's a hunter.\" The mercenary gestured around him with a deft hand. \"She picked off the guards one by one until there was a manageable group for her to take out at once.\" Pilot knelt down and traced the circle around them. \"This is clinical precision. She left us completely untouched inside a circle of gore. She's well trained, incredibly skilled and a show-boat to boot.\" The freelancer tilted his head to look at the group. \"Now who does that sound like?\" Event Horizon snorted incredulously, trying to mask the unease he felt.\n\n\"Speculation won't do us any good. We need to press on, otherwise this was for nothing.\" Minato took command of the situation, smoothing out his suit. \"Can you stop her if she returns?\" Event Horizon shrugged. \"That's reassuring. Let's move.\" They moved as a group now, unwilling to separate lest they suffer the same fate as their guardians. Patters kept a telekinetic shield around them as they travelled, the barrier crackling to life every time a gust of air from the fans buffeted it. With no reliable method to discern their location, the team relied on gut instinct and very subtle hints.\n\n\"Are we seriously following the blood trail?\" Pilot swatted Event Horizon across the head, drawing another sigh from the speedster. \"It's just so cliche...and a trap. Like, it's really obviously a trap.\" His fellows shushed him as they stalked after the smeared residue of their foot-soldiers. It finally ended at a door, larger than the rest. \n\n\"I concur with our quick-footed friend. This is incredibly cliche.\" Patters sighed mournfully, bony shoulders drooping in sorrow. \"It simply makes me miss the Director even more.\" Event Horizon rolled his eyes before moving to the door. He leaned against it, putting his shoulder to the cold metal, and looked to Minato. The con-man nodded in assent and, with a grunt of effort, the door was torn free. A faint light flickered from the chamber, painting the team in a dull glow. Patters reinforced his shield once more and the villains charged towards the illumination. Their assault petered out in mere moments as they gazed upon the contents within: Hundreds of large glass containers, each housing the floating form of a superhero or villain. \n\n\"Fuck me sideways.\" Event Horizon breathed in awe, eyes flickering between the dimly shining tubes. \"They're all naked.\" Pilot struck him without looking, his own attention swept up by the floating forms of Kitsune and Event Horizon. \n\n\"It's a cloning lab. Pinnacle...he cloned all of them. Everyone of the supers that died, he took their DNA and made more of them.\" The mercenary was trembling, his body weak. \"If he does to them what he did to the Zel'tan...Pinnacle would have an army of fanatically loyal super-beings.\" He cradled his head between his hands and muttered quietly to himself. \"There's no military in the world that could stand up to a force like this.\" Patters lay one tiny talon on Pilot's shoulder in consolation. \"We need to blast these things into space or kill them here and now. There must be a purge command somewhere.\" While Pilot searched for a command console, Patters floated over to Minato's shoulder.\n\n\"You've been awfully quiet, my dear medium. What troubles you?\" Kitsune barely noticed the concerned tones of his demonic friend; his vision was locked on a larger container near the back of the room, different from the others. Inside it floated the costumed, battered form of a woman. Minato trudged to the pod, unable to comprehend what he saw.\n\n\"River Fox.\" There was a note of wonderment in his voice as he gazed upon at the superhero. She was injured but alive, given the steady rise and fall of her chest. He traced the glass affectionately. \"I thought she was dead. I thought they were all dead.\" His face scrunched up in confusion, glancing between her pod and those containing naked clones. \"She looks different from the others. Why doesn't she look like one of the Uncanny Valley floating science-babies?\" Realisation dawned on him and Minato spun on his heel. \"Check the pods! I need to know if there's a clone of River Fox or anyone else still in their costume.\" The group scattered, moving between the containers and taking note. Event Horizon zipped through the pods before laughing.\n\n\"Holy shit, there's not. I think those are the real ones!\" The speedster crowed jubilantly. \"We've got River Fox, Stonewall, The Scarlet Sentinel and Doctor Paradox. That's one hell of a team.\"\n\n\"Makes sense. Pinnacle still needs the base DNA to work off of, I guess.\" Pilot mused quietly to himself. He moved to Minato, standing off of one side. \"So, what are you thinking?\" Kitsune smiled, his pleased grin at odds with their current situation.\n\n\"I think we've just found an equaliser. Let's wake up the superheroes.\"\n",

I just want to share some cool stories, earn that sweet internet points and show some mistakes we are making. This post is barely an intro, as I really want to avoid anything too long to read  and there are some things I want to mention beforehand :P.\nWe've set some simple rules.\n\n* there isn't a neccessity to have a big, overarching plot\n\n* Players may have multiple characters\n\n* it is a continuation of a previous campaign, played in similiar way, albeit in other location, and some of the players have changed characters since then, and some PCs stayed as \"A-team\" for high level games\n\n* we have rotating GMs, we give them XP based on performance, so they can level up their characters along with us\n\n* we *borrow* a lot of things from many works of fiction, see below\n\nOur heroes all live in city of Bazaar (*Marketplace* in our language). The city is home of a heroes guild called, just because we could not find a better name, *Shield*. It is led by paladin named Lotheris (big, black bald guy, without an eyepatch, for now) and it has loads of personnel, most of it PCs. Think Fairy Tail, but with less wizards. \n;)\n\nPCs include banished son o Loki(long story), an arcane duelist(armed with very Dresden Files-like Holy Sword) and stepsister of the banished guy, a cross between Alex Mercer and Thing, wannabe Hawkeye whose bow was stolen, Alphonse Elric as a Deathbringer(giant suit of armor killing things for Death), a Druid that is in pact with a Fire Demon, a loli Geister with ghost onee-sama, dimension hopping teenager thinking with portals and the City Thief who is remarkably unremarkable.\n\nNext episode: We meet some of protagonists, Al-Druida shows its ugly head and our heroes find an evidence of a dastardly necromancers plot.

This takes place right after the last one, so nothing really happened between, other than the Scout (he just remade his character) somehow getting arrested by existing.\n\nBecause Snidley sold a bunch of wenches to the king, he was invited to a \"thank you\" feast. We go to his castle, which is super fancy, and we were going to go to it anyways because we heard the BBEG was gonna assassinate the king.\n\nSo before I continue, I'll talk about the DM's magical items. He just pulled off whatever he wanted and see if it worked. Some were useful, like the Dagger of Truth or the Bomb Defuser Gloves. Some were like the Elemental Towel, which would emit a specified element when a keyword was said, both of which nobody could identify.\n\nWe started cramming our items into the Bag of Holding in which Snidley kept his explosives, mostly because our backpacks were full and it was the only Bag of Holding. In retrospect, it was a bad idea.\n\nNow, one of the guys tells the king he's gonna get assassinated. The king laughs at this idea. Insert basic king talk here. Then the king said \"I hope that your time here was excellent\"\n\nRemember that towel? The keyword was \"excellent\" and the element was fire, and we were keeping it in Snidley's bomb bag, which he was hiding on his person \"just in case\". \n\nKABOOM\n\nThe king died. The whole party died (save for Scout, who was in prison). The BBEG, who turned out to be the prince, died. The whole castle is leveled and half the town is crushed.\n\nThe DM erupts into laughter, since he was going to have a BBEG fight and we just \"made it better\". Apparently, Scout managed to use his association with the party to become the new king. The campaign ended there.\n\nYou see, the way the group works, when one person finishes DMing, the next one in the cycle starts. Now I'm going to be the next DM. This was a week ago. The former Soldier texted me and told me that the former Fighter is encouraging everyone to make wacky characters. The next session is this weekend. Anyone have any tips?\n",

The party is as follows:\n\nCireasa \"Cherry\" Avere, a human magus,\n\nRendus, a human summoner with Seril as his demon cat/eidolon,\n\nLenny, a human alchemist,\n\nVictor, a dhampir inquisitor,\n\nand me as Siegfrid Stardust, the half-orc changeling bard with magician archetype.\n\nIt is day 3 of the party's stay in Ravengro and the party has split up in the morning to prepare and/or learn. Lenny and Siggy went off to the Temple of Pharasma to research the 5 most notorious criminals locked in Harrowstone while the rest went to the town to get the feel of it. Siggy didn't have much luck in finding out about Father Charlatan, so she decides to head to the tavern to blow off some steam. When she goes in, she exclaims that she is going to \"perform some magic. And music. Mostly music\" to the whole bar. Now, the items used in this bit of performance were a pan pipe and a vial of alchemist's fire (with the trait Stage Magic in order to not incinerate her pipes and give a +2 bonus to perform checks) to make the played note expel fire. She also used the spell Alter Musical Instrument to make the flutes sound like a guitar. After that came the perform roll.\n\nA nat 20.\n\nCombined with +10 due to skill ranks, charisma mods, and the alchemist's fire. The DM determined that this was worthy of the Uprising Harrow Card (for fantastic use of fire), which in his words, will scale to whatever scenario it is finally used in and is just bullshitted up.\n\nAfter this, Siggy proceded to get hilariously drunk due to her negative CON mod.

After every session the DM writes a bit of our journey in the form of a bard who's watching the party's adventure unfold and explains the adventure from the bard's own opinion to be held in the history books of this homebrewed land. The following tales will be minimally edited and have been posted with the DM's permission.\n\nAs the bard doesn't know the PCs names, or more appropriately doesn't care for them, he has given everyone a pseudonym.\n\nPseudonym | PC name | Race &amp; Class\n---|---|----\nCaptain Grumpypants | Soren | Human Monk\nTentmaker | Rogina | Halfling Rogue\nNaive Girl | Hannah Clearwood | Aasimar Summoner\nHorsedude | Garth Vancer | Human Cavalier\nShort Loose Cannon | Laras \"Jorybar\" Thorngauge | Halfling Rogue\nRockthing | Chroma | Oread Warpriest\n\nSome of the DM's own characters make an appearance in Bingle's Tale.\n\nFred - The god of Freedom, Time and Alcoholism; Mainly Crippling Crippling Alcoholism.\n\nYoseff - Human Bard. To get an idea about Yoseff, think cover of any trashy romance novel\n\n**Day 01**\n\nI met the strangest people today. They all had that “Just had a totally not prophetic in any way shape or form dream” look about them! There was Captain Grumpypants, Tentmaker, Naive Girl, Horsedude, Short Loose Cannon and Rockthing. Captain Grumpypants looks like he needed to spend more time in that state… These guys messed around for awhile, even looking at that crazy job board thing that lead them to the most terrifying of locations… the dreaded DMV! They seem determined to take out those bandits on the way back from taking out those yucky greenskins.\n\nThose guys actually survived being a crocodile’s lunch! Then they ate the crocodile right back! It was SO COOL! Even better, that awesome guy Fred stopped by and gave them a boat, some pills, and a keg! He even made a random sword totally cool looking with like, flame decals and such! I heard Captain Grumpypants performance troupe saying bad things about him missing a show.\n\nThose guys had a tragic occurence. Tentmakers dark past of tent-related deaths caught up to him, leading to her being eaten by a shark. RIP Tentmaker.\n\n**Day 02**\n\nThose crazy fellows took a boat across the shark infested lake. It was so nuts! There was like, krakens and sharks fighting everywhere! They were like WHOOOA and WOOSH and SHAWOOM, but they eventually landed safe on a beach near the ick greenskins “home”. \n\nThose idiots decided to sneak in one by one and get captured by greenskins, culminating in Horsedude going in last and having to fight a Rancor to free them all! Short Loose Cannon got hybernation sickness! There was a large greenskin campfire that they all sang songs around after the dumb dumb tallthings left.\n\nTurns out those greenskins wanted a bigger campfire! While the dummy group was figuring out that they had mythical “Sober pills”, them greenskins made this awesome fire that left the forest DEVASTATED! Oh yeah, and Captain Grumpypants is in a lot of fire with his fellow performers. He better make his last minute appearance tomorrow or one his fellow actors is totally going to DIE! HE NEEDS TO COME IN AT THE LAST SECOND TO SAVE HIS LIFE!\n\t\n**Day 03**\n\nOh man, you should have seen it, a single coconut from tree-greenskins was enough to send these guys all running. Sadly Short Loose Cannon found a totally not significant stone key of some sort in the field. Once again they split up some, but not as badly this time, they managed to almost not die this time but Captain Grumpypants got lice from greenskin doges! Some absolutely sexy man named Yoseff showed up to save the day after that.\n\nYoseff lead the band of morons into this room that the greenskins could explode by playing a drum where they killed this crazy fire-wielding greenskin. After that they ran off after some slightly larger greenskin and a holyguy instead of playing with the explosives like any sane person would have!\n\nApparently this fort was like, a greenskin school or something. Know what they learn at greenskin school? HOW MUCH GNOMES ARE BETTER THAN GREENSKINS! Apparently one of them knew some spell or something to suggest things to a large mass of people and hid it behind a room that shot fire out of the door! Oh, and they met my good friend swordogre, someday I hope to meet him myself to make him aware he’s my friend.\n\nThey killed that taller greenskin who made himself WAY TALLER and the holyguy who kept screaming stuff about Rovagug not keeping his promise. That’s mean of Rovagug, he should keep his promise. Oh, and there were some really gross looking worms.\n\nCaptain Grumpypants seems to have incurred the wrath of an entire acting troupe for having missed an entire stops worth of shows. They uttered an actor’s curse upon him and everything!\n\nThe group of dummies (Led by Rockthing obviously) slept amongst a bunch of rocks, they slept so well that they had no watch awake to notice the awful things done to them during the night! I swear one of them softly caressed another one while they were asleep and it wasn’t me! Nono! I wasn’t there, I was in town doing the drunk or something!\n\n**Day 04**\n\nEveryone woke up annoyed at Short Loose Cannon for being asleep instead of making sure sneaky Gnomes didn’t softly caress their supple cheeks in their sleep. I mean, ignore that part. When everyone woke up, Rockthing apparently didn’t feel so good and had their face ripped apart by temporal distortions and a new Rockthing from another dimension took dead Rockthings place. Their dimension was almost identical to ours, but instead of being a smashypriest, new Rockthing is a froopy normal priest. Oh, and in that world the wonderful midlife crisis Tentmaker was still alive, and Short Loose Cannon was lightly roasted at a barbecue and fed to the band of morons, aah, good times, to bad that dimension collapsed on itself right after the portal closed…. OR SO THEY THOUGHT!! DUN DUN DUUUUN!!! Captain Grumpypants totally soiled his grumpypants.\n\nThen our band of intrepid heros marched out and confidently walked past the Goblin party, once again leaving that interesting drum where it was.\n\nThey returned to their boat, I was really hoping I’d get to taunt them about forgetting a keg of beer a god told them to hang onto… though they lost one keg of beer to a random dwarf… maybe he hatched from it? Everyone knows that’s how dwarves are born! Also it turns out the boat Super Awesome and Shiny Fred gave them can turn into a wagon.\n\nSneaking around the fort, the party got cornered by a pants obsessed goblin! OH NO! THIS IS THE END FOR THEM! ...oh wait, they gave Tentmaker the Awesome’s pants to the Goblin, jokes on them, THOSE WERE PANTS OF AWESOME! \n\nOn the way back to town, the party met the bandits, sorry, “Private Security Company that collects tolls for their services”. Miss Prissy Rich Noble Face gave them her parents contact to “legitimize”, oh that’s going to be hilarious.\n\nShort Loose Cannon commited a party foul, and then promised double the regular payment after returning. Naturally, he did not. There is absolutely no way that that’s going to come back to haunt him.\n\nI GOT TO SING THE TALE OF GRUMPYPANTS TO GRUMPYPANYS!!!!!\n",

        "text": "This is a game I played at a con this summer so I can't take credit for the premise.  There were four of us at the table, not counting the GM. We started with character creation, which was a little unorthodox. All of us were, of course, Musketeers. So rather than choosing different careers, we all had to choose different specialties. They were:\n\n**MONTAGNE:** the player directly across from me made a Musketeer that was essentially Porthos, if you're familiar with the book. If not, he's the typical braggart soldier- big, bold, hot-tempered, and supposedly a hit with the ladies.\n\n**GERVAISE:** The player next to Montagne. He made a charmer, a fellow with a blandly honest face.\n\n**CHANTEUSE:** The player closest to me, a fat guy who must have been nearly 45 and had a bad moustache created a lady Musketeer, whose name I don't need to make up because I still remember it- \"Chanteuse de la Boudoir\", or in English, \"The Bedroom Singer\". He didn't say anything about it directly, but he drew a corset with cleavage bursting out of the top on his name tag. Just in case we would forget, I guess.\n\n**DUVALIER:** As for me, I rolled up Duvalier. Duvalier was a gambler, but in my mind he was the sort of person who really thought of cards as games of skill. I created him to be a schemer and a student of human nature. He was also handy with a set of pistols, which I hoped might be useful to the group.\n\nThe game opens with our characters tied up, some kneeling, some standing, in front of His Eminence, Cardinal Richelieu. If you're unfamiliar with the Three Musketeers books, Richelieu is one of the main antagonists and is the last guy you want to piss off- cunning, powerful, rich and with a small army at his command, he has it in his power to make things very uncomfortable for fun-loving Musketeers such as ourselves.\n\n\"Gentleman,\" the Cardinal says, \"I thought you would have had the wits to come quietly.\"\n\n\"If this were a movie-\" the GM said, interrupting the narrative, \"The subtitle would say 'Part One: The Man in the Red Suit'.\" We all chuckled appreciatively. The cardinal went on to explain that he had heard- through confidential sources, no doubt- that the infant daughter of King Louis XIII was about to be betrothed to the young son of the Prince of Conde, a second cousin and heir to one of France's great dynasties. If the union took place, it would put a great deal of power into the couple's hands and the hands of any children they might one day have. Power that threatened the monarchy, and of course he wanted us (without being able to explicitly order us) to put a stop to it.\n\nAfter some snooping, we found from one of my friends at the court that the Condes had in their possession a necklace of diamonds and sapphires that was a traditional betrothal gift for the family. Nobody was married into the clan without it, and the King had every right to expect that it would be presented to his daughter when the announcement was made.  We also discovered that the hall had been decorated with the colors of the Condes- they were coming to Paris for the Christmas festivities. The betrothal would no doubt take place officially very soon.\n\nWasting no time, we asked for and obtained a leave of absence from M. de Treville, captain of His Majesty's Musketeers. We rode down towards Burgundy with all haste, stopping one night at an inn where Chanteuse, in her male clothes, was refused service. It was an insult to all present and nearly caused a row- until Chanteuse convinced the innkeeper to discuss theology with her. They retired to the innkeeper's quarters and talked about Bible verse all night. At least, that's what Chanteuse told us the next morning. Duvalier had won some coin (in real life, some \"bennies\"- points cashed in to affect the plot)  in a card game, so he paid little attention.\n\nComing to the city of Dijon and its palace, we had to find out if the Prince of Conde was inside. It seemed at first we would have to infiltrate the city, but I (or Duvalier) had a simpler idea. \n\n\"The flag,\" I said, \"On the palace. Is it flying the Conde standard? That would mean they're in residence.\" The GM looked a little put out. I sensed that he had \"inside the palace\" material that was now effectively useless.\n\n\"Yes, the standard is flying,\" he sighed.\n\nWe devised a plan. The first thing we did was ask the GM if our characters knew of anything that King Louis hated. \n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"He doesn't care for the Germans.\" This encouraged us to by some german sausages in town.\n\n\"But dry, cured sausages,\" I said, \"like landjaegers or something.\"\n\nSome leagues away from the city we would stage a fake highway robbery. Chanteuse would play the damsel in distress, and Gervaise would pretend to be her brother. Montagne and I were to be the highwaymen. When the Prince's caravan arrived we would make our escape and follow at a distance while Gervaise or Chanteuse looked for the necklace.\n\n\"And,\" Montagne said jovially, \"We should kill a few of the Prince's guards- to make it look real.\" The rest of the group agreed that verisimilitude was of paramount importance.\n\nThe plan went off without a hitch and Duvalier, dressed as a highwayman, did not retreat before firing his pistols at the Prince's guards, wounding one. By nightfall the caravan made its way back to the inn where we had stayed previously. There was a tense moment when we feared Chanteuse would be recognized but, dressed as she was in a gown instead of her male Musketeer's garb, she went unnoticed.\n\nThat night Gervaise did his part to get the Prince's guard good and drunk. Chanteuse took it upon herself to search the carriages, but she could not find the necklace. There was only one more logical place for it- on the Prince's own person.\n\nNow the Prince was a single man, his wife having died in childbirth. Chanteuse thought, naturally, that she could have her way him and search him while he slept. To affect this she took a bottle of the inn's finest brandy and two cups- one of which she laced with laudanum, or some other opiate she had tucked away. Mounting the steps to the Prince's room, she knocked upon the door. The Prince, weary with travel, opened it.\n\n\"I thought, your Grace, that you might enjoy a nightcap? The brandy is very good, but I do so hate to drink alone.\"\n\n\"There are many patrons still downstairs, madame.\" The Prince replied, unimpressed with Chanteuse's transparent seduction attempt, \"Perhaps you can find some company there.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I think that company a bit too rough for a lady like me. Haven't I been through enough? What kind of woman do you take me for?\" (This is the part of the story that I must remind the reader all these lines were being spoken by an obese man of middle age who did not have all of his teeth.)\n\n\"I take you for the kind of woman who can take a hint.\" the Prince said, coming as close to bluntness as good breeding allowed. \"Now, goodnight, madame.\"\n\nChanteuse (and the player, who had rolled suspiciously high stats for her) were at a loss. Nobody could be immune to the female Musketeer's charms! But if she could not get into the room with guile, she would have to do it... with climbing. After waiting until the prince would be asleep, she shinnied out her window and across a narrow ledge to the Prince's. She pried it open as quietly as she was able and searched the room until she noticed a bulge beneath the Prince's nightshirt. It proved to be a leather bag containing the necklace! Carefully she opened the bag, slipped the necklace out and replaced it with its same weight in sausages. This went much better than her botched seduction, and she emerged into the night triumphant.\n\nAfter that, events went fairly quickly. Chanteuse and Gervaise took their leave of the Prince and met up with Montagne and I. We returned to Paris without incident. The only question that remained was what to do with the necklace. We could give it to the cardinal. We could keep it as a memento, although it wouldn't do to show anybody. A necklace worth hundreds of thousands of pistoles in the hands of some poor Musketeers would no doubt raise questions. I'm proud to say it was I who thought of what was to be done. I cashed in all of my \"bennies\" I had and laid out my plan:\n\n\"I know a certain money changer...\"\n\nMy thought was that Duvalier, being a gambling man, would know all the most important pawnbrokers and moneylenders in Paris. It stood to reason, therefore, that he knew one with the means to buy the necklace.\n\nThe GM agreed and, taking my bennies, said that Duvalier likely knew a Dutch Jew who was trustworthy lender who would not ask questions. We took the necklace to him and he made us an offer. His people back in the Netherlands would have to pirate the Spanish to acquire all the gold needed to pay for the necklace, but pirate they would, and the fortune they obtained was all ours!\n\nAfterward, the GM said that in all his time running this adventure, we were the only group to have figured out a way to sell the necklace. Most groups, he said, just give it to Richelieu. That surprised me, and I was proud that Duvalier's character made it possible to profit from our Yuletide thievery.\n",

        "text": "I'm bored, so I decided to write down another one of my Snidley Whiplash stories. Some of the things that happened in between was Peter Griffin killing half of the world's supply of chickens, Engineer convincing the owner of a magic school to give them most of their items and Spy stealing the rest, and Snidley burning down an entire forest because he was \"kinda sure\" the BBEG was hiding there.\n\nSnidley Whiplash won't actually appear in this story, because he was now the owner of the fighter's brothel and wanted to \"try out\" all of them. So the rest of the group went to the place that we were pretty sure was the BBEG's headquarters.\n\nNew characters include the dwarven fighter's new Half-Elf Druid, his GF's new Half-Elf Sorcerer (a ton of romance happened here), Demoman (Fighter), Spy (Rogue), and Engineer (Wizard) because former Paladin Shrek wanted to be a TF2 guy.\n\nSo they get rekt by the fortress' forces, and end up almost dead at the throne door. Behind it, is the BBEG's new 2nd-in-command. He starts monologuing about how the country would fall, evil would rise, etc, etc.\n\nEngineer decides \"Screw it\" and uses one of his magic items, a freezing orb, on him. Frozen for a turn. The group unleashes a crit chain on him, with Engie going last, and using his turn to deploy another freeze orb on him. Eventually, he dies.\n\nSo they're all relieved, but Scout decides he wants to take a number two in his dead mouth. Okay, we let him.\n\nSuddenly, he gets up and kills the scout with a Burning Hands to the face. He was somehow faking his death. So the group beats him within an inch of his life and interrogates him. With super-high Charisma rolls, he tells us everything before we kill him. All the while, the DM is face palming because he was going to reveal that info in at least 6 sessions.\n\nWhen we get back, the brothel had turned into a crater, and he had sold all the wenches to the corrupt king.\n\nA little short, I know. Next I'll tell about the end of Snidley and Friends' adventure. Spoiler: it's a little anticlimactic.",

I introduced him as a taller than your average dwarf nearly as tall as a normal human so he was mistaken for a human sometimes, whenever his beard like the Niagara Falls of beards didn't tell people otherwise. Oh and my character NEVER took off his armor ever. ANYWAYS. we started off on some podunk ship going to some podunk town called River-Ville or whatever because it was on a river or something stupid like that. Now as I try to mingle with the other characters Maravik notices something under the water, but just as he notices it we crash into it. So Turns out its a blockade specifically made to stop boats that go by Rivers-Ville because nobody docks here anyways. So we hop off and yell at the locals for a while until we find out who messed up our ship. We figure out it \"Were dem damn'd gobins.\" so being the group of rag-tag adventurers we are we go out into the woods with no hints on the direction of the goblins hideout basically just hoping to be ambushed. Wow whats that an ambush? Didn't expect that, as a group of 15 mook gobins and a gobin leader and his bodygaurd all jump out the bush screaming hoping to get the jump on us. Unfortunately for them they were across the field when they started screaming so of course they didn't get the jump on us. This is when my new to D&amp;D brain thought \"I can do anything I want\" So I take out some goblin skulls we found on the road put them between my thighs and scream \"I AM VENYIL TOFFER SLAYER OF GOBLINS!\" and crush a skull betwixt my thighs. Natural 20. The Dm says that 10 of the 15 mooks run off into the forest yelling that they definitely heard of me before and aren't going to die for their leader that turned out better than expected. then we proceed to roll the worst I've seen ever and that includes in the 2 and a half years I've played D&amp;D since then. first we kill 1 goblin mook then the rest of the party gets stuck trying to fight the leader and his bodyguard and they leave me to deal with this group of 4 mooks and since I was before the goblins on the initiative tracker I decide hey lets move to engage the goblins! DM says \"Roll Perception\" I didn't roll a 1 but I didn't pass either. I step into a trap set by goblins and get strung up in a tree. While in said tree I proceed to get battered by goblins like a pinata while my character screams from getting his eyes gouged out with sticks with pointy ends and such. I being the genius new player I am don't even think about cutting myself down and swing blindly with a penalty trying to hit these goblins. The party manages to kill everything while I flail wildly in the tree basically blinded. My friends cut me down and we proceed to take one of the goblins prisoner. This is where the first session ended (Spoiler: my DM in the future likes to describe how badly I get hurt whenever I do something stupid but then somehow my body is pristine besides the armor stank in the next 10 minutes)\n\nWell I don't know this is my first post so tell me if you want more Venyil stories. I'm doing these chronological order so future stories might be better when I become well, better.",

        "text": "It's been too long. Welcome to the next Snidley Whiplash story. A lot happened in between this story and the last one: including but not limited to: Scout landing all of us in prison by flipping off a Dragonborn, Soldier getting in a debate with SpongeBob over whether or not a certain patch of territory belonged to a goat that ended in the destruction of an entire city, and the fighter accidentally buying an entire brothel. But let's move on.\n\nSome new character were the former Pyro's Sniper (Ranger), Monk Shrek's SpongeBob, later replaced with Peter Griffin (Monk), Paladin Shrek's Mr. Bones (Wizard) and the girl's new dwarven Cleric, Hera (the mayor's daughter died in the SpongeBobocalypse).\n\nAfter the dragon incident, the fighter started enforcing two rules:\n&gt; 1. Snidley must be 30 feet from his explosives sack at all times\n\n&gt; 2. One PC must always be next to Snidley to enforce Rule 1\n\nMore often than not, the Fighter ended up next to me while Soldier carried my explosives sack. The Fighter gave me a crossbow so I wasn't completely useless in combat, and Snidley was a pretty good skill monkey as well, making him the one who was often disarming traps.\n\nBefore I continue on to the next part, I'll tell you that the DM always used the same world for all of the campaigns he ran. TL:DR there have been 2 world wars, each of which our characters had at least participated in.\n\nNow, we had managed to find out a lot about the BBEG. He was definitely royalty of either the country we were in or the next one over, and he wanted ours to be eliminated.\n\nWhile we were storming one of his outposts, Snidley leveled up to 6. He had been going full Rogue all this time, but the group wanted him to be part Bard so he could be a better skill monkey. Instead, I made him go Cleric, so he could blast better. The group gave some grumbles, and (at-the-time) SpongeBob said \"That's a bad multi-class!\" Well, I was about to prove him wrong.\n\nTo skip a lot of plot, the fighter had to fight the BBEG's second-in-command 1v1 on a town on the border of our country and the adjacent one. The rest of the group was off helping the fighter grind and get levels, and because they didn't want another Snidley incident (they knew for a fact Snidley still had bombs on his person) and left him under the care of a guard NPC.\n\nThat wasn't a problem for Snidley. He got rid of (read: poisoned, tied up and threw off a cliff) the guard. He has quite the negative opinion of the fighter, and put together a plan to take it into his own hands.\n\nHe went to the library to do some research. He found out about a gunpowder mine where he could get some good stuff. But he was broke (the group didn't trust him with money), so he formulated a plan. \n\nHe stole a horse and cart from the local stable via what was left of the bomb supply. I rode to the mine, which was under some decent security. No matter, I used Sacred Flame to blow up an entire barrel of gunpowder. While they were investigating this I used my Stealth skill to load up a dozen barrels into my cart. I fumbled one of the rolls, so I had to cap it at a dozen and make a quick getaway (being in Light Domain with gunpowder everywhere helped with that). \n\nYou see, while he was in the library, Snidley found out about a hidden tunnel system under the border that was put in during the war (thanks to Scout's player). So he found the entrance, went to the place directly under where the fight was going to be and spent quite a while loading enough gunpowder to arouse Micheal Bay into that spot. He also set up a trail of gunpowder going there, so he could activate it from afar. And I had managed to set up a private session with the DM to do this, so nobody else had any idea.\n\nThe day of the fight comes. I'll admit, for a while it was actually pretty epic. The fighter was a Battle Master and had some sweet moves. But after a while, it got repetitive, so I set off the fuse with a well-placed Sacred Flame and booked it.\n\nThe Scout was the only one who made a perception check high enough to see the little spark, and ran at 160 feet per round (he was multiclassing as Monk now) to get away. Peter and Soldier ran after him. The Fighter, Mr Bones, Sniper, and the new Cleric didn't notice. You can imagine what happened next...\n\nKABOOOOM!!!\n\nThe DM decided to make it a save-or-die. The Fighter and Sniper managed to succeed, but they each took 10d12 damage, which killed both. Scout and Peter were outside the blast radius enough to take a measly 2d6 damage, and all the others (save for Snidley) got insta-killed, including the boss. The DM decided to reveal that he was going to have the boss kill the fighter because he was getting a tad powerful and annoying, but this was much better. \n\nBut that wasn't the end of it. The town was turned into a crater, and both countries got into a dispute about who's town it was, which escalated into war. The DM also told us that he was going to start a war anyways, and I saved him a lot of work. In fact, he revived all of the characters, with different names, of course. Snidley pretty much became the party face after that.\n\nNext time, I'll tell you about how Scout cut 6 sessions from our game.",

        "text": "This is a sequel to my last gametale, \"Blaze the Exploding Snail\". The members of our party are as such:\n\nRakus: An extremely strong dwarf who isn't afraid to rush headlong into danger. \nBlaze: (me) A charismatic wizard who acts depending on how the wind blows. \nGerus: A teafling who hates everyone and everything about the whole world.\nTalion: A sharpshooter who is famed all across the land with his elven shortbow and seemingly limitless arrows and patience.\n\nSince our last session, Talion had been captured by an evil fire mage whose name we never had time to find out (more on that later. We stumbled around in the sewers for a bit, before we entered a supply closet, at which point the ground began to lift up beneath us. Suddenly, we were in an arena, hemmed in on all sides by ten-feet-tall walls that we were told were insurmountable.\n\nThe man who had orchestrated this was someone we'd met before, and he told us that we were to play for our lives against ten waves of horrible monsters. He said that we were to take on these monsters one at a time. \n\nAt this point, our DM broke character and put on \"Death By Glamour\" from Undertale - every single person playing the game loves Undertale - and I played along. When the man asked for volunteers to take on the first monster, I stuck my hand up and waved it around like I wanted nothing more to fight to the death against... an OGRE!?!?! Meanwhile, my two friends were shackled and held above some boiling oil/acid/whatever. \n\nRound 1: I cast Burning Hands, hit for something like 12 damage. Ogre takes a swipe at me, hits me for 7. (I now have 8 health, ogre has 30). In the meantime, Gerus and Rakus both struggle to escape.\n\nJokingly, I turn my heel and pose for the audience. Then, I start dancing as I cast Magic Missile, and direct all 3 at the ogre. They do a pitiful 8 damage, and I continue to dance as the ogre smashes me into the floor, having enough time for only a half-hearted \"woo\" before I collapse.\n\nIn the meantime, Gerus has wriggled free, battled off a guard, and freed Rakus from his bindings. Together, the two of them beat off the ogre, eventually emerging victorious. The evil mage then told us that the second round would be... a bear! By this time, I'd successfully rolled 3 saving throws and was back on my feet. I cast Magic Missile again, Rakus sledgehammered it, Gerus stabbed it, and thankfully it didn't go for me. We had another go, and this time the bear DID target me. I was only on 1hp, but thankfully it didn't send me critical. I fainted again, still dancing, and the two others ripped it to shreds.\n\nAt this point, the mage told us not to worry, as there was no possible way that we could defeat his next, and final wave... final? I asked him about the whole ten waves thing, and he said \"Oh that? That was just a bluff. Nobody's ever made it past the first wave, let alone the second. But now, you will face off against my head guard, who has such strong armour she is invulnerable!\"\n\nA vaguely female form detatched itself from the mage's cohort and leapt nimbly down onto the battlefield. The DM changed music, from \"Death by Glamour\" to \"Power of Neo - Ikarus Remix\" to let us know that s*** just got real. She taunted us - \"Haha! The only thing that can get through my armour is fre, and your mage is unconscious! I am invincible!\"\n\nMistake number one: taunting a mage\n\nA flashback is necessary at this point. While we were exploring the town we found ourselves in, we stumbled across a weapons merchant at a market. He had swords, axs, and all sorts of artful killing tools - incuding something called a \"rifle\". It had no bullets, just a mystical powder that acted as both the propellant and the ammunition. Rakus bought a rifle for 100 gold, but I, sensing an opportunity, bought four bags of the mystical powder for future usage. See, the powder would cause explosions if thrown, and if ignited it would be even more devestating - just the thing for a mage like myself.\n\nMoving back to the arena, Rakus threw some of the dust in the woman's face and she reeled back, now ignited. She then proceeded to take down both of my friends, including one permanently (Gerus! No!). Her special skill was that she could attack thrice per turn, which devestated the both of them. \n\nI successfully rolled a saving throw yet again, and shakily got to my feet. She laughed in my face, saying \"Do you want to die that eagerly? Well then, for your bravery, I shall let you attack first.\"\n\nMistake number two.\n\nTaking a bag of powder in each hand, I cast flame hands, which normally dealed 3d6 of damage unless they passed a dexterity saving throw. The DM told me that each bag of powder I used would double the effectiveness of a fire spell, meaning that at the cost of 2 gold per atack I could effectively quadruple my damage. She failed her dex saving throw, and I rolled the 3d6s - giving me 15 damage total.\n\n60 damage. In ONE attack. That's even better than the 42 damage Rakus can do with his hammer! The woman was seared off the face of the earth! Havng performed this action, I turned to the crowd, and, posing dramatically, shouted \"Glamour, b*****s!\"",

        "text": "[On a tiny little comet, whizzing around in the upper atmosphere above a big old world of fantasy bullshit, there was quite a bit of commotion over a hotdog cart.](https://redd.it/4jo9rv)\n\nThe party, a motley group of 'adventurers' under the loose direction of the [reasonably-sane ranger Ling Ling](http://imgur.com/2SwMf0l), had managed to extract themselves from a spot of bother involving a murderous lich running on pure, unbridled hatred and a flotilla of airships cruising at orbital height by simply hurling their dreaded enemy over the edge. And then there was the business about getting imprisoned, accused of some things, and wouldn't you know there was a trial by combat, go kill this thing, mysterious airship holding an entire forest of ravening plant creatures, cold iron elemental, friendships were made, tearful goodbyes, and then everyone got bored and went off for hotdogs.\n\nGranted, there may have been some pig in them at one point, but the fact of the matter was that they were mostly reprocessed corpses of the sapient variety. [Jello Shot, the magical slime](http://imgur.com/oNuhhTF), did not see anything particularly wrong with this, but [Loki the half-elvish rogue](http://imgur.com/LFK6CyZ) most certainly did. Clearly, the suspect nature of the meat meant that they were entitled to discounts. And, by any chance, would the vendor be willing to make change for this mysterious beetle amulet that had suddenly appeared on his doorstep, personally addressed to him?\n\nLing Ling showed up in time to ruin the fun, insisting that NO it was not alright to eat reprocessed human meat, yes, even if it was grilled, and no, that didn't apply to Jello Shot *as such*, seriously why are you encouraging this hot dog vendor who is clearly using their business to dispose of troublesome corpses? The hotdog vendor objected that, no, of course this wasn't the case, people were killed SPECIFICALLY FOR the making of these fine hot dogs, to enhance the flavor. This did not help matters.\n\nWhen Ling Ling finally pried the troublesome Loki away from his arguments about the proper price of artifacts and their relation to premium 'pork' sausage values, Ling Ling asked the obvious question of where the hell Loki had gotten the little green scarab. Loki, of course, helpfully told the story of the unmarked box addressed to him left on his doorstep without any sort of postal service being involved. Which was clearly perfectly innocuous, as the incredible sleazeball that was Loki was sure to have a myriad of devoted fans. Ling Ling loudly wondered if there was a saving throw versus stupidity, or just rampant and unbridled ego. She insisted that the damn thing SHOULD NOT be worn until it was properly examined, because after all, there was a powerful undead lich out there who very much wanted to messily kill all of th-\n\nAt this point, the little green beetle sprang to life and started burrowing directly into Loki's chest, towards his heart, through his armor and his ribcage. That's right. The creature of unimaginable hatred, who was stuck in another dimension and at the foot of a rather large climb through hundreds of miles of rather unforgiving thin air, without a single spell to his name, had nonetheless found a way to continue the wholesale murder of his targets- by fedexing Loki a [Scarab of Death](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/cursed-items#TOC-Scarab-of-Death). And as the horrible beetle burrowed into Loki's heart, the panicking party was very nearly helpless. Except, of course, for Jello Shot, who knew exactly what to do and wasn't terribly bothered about how to do it. He reached in with a slimy tendril, grabbed hold of the horrible burrowing creature, and wrenched it out amidst a fountain of blood.\n\nThere was a problem. Jello Shot's ranks in Heal were about equal to his ranks in Craft: Underwater Basket Weaving, and the \"surgery\" had just left a gaping, bleeding, acid-scarred hole in the rather vital organs of the rather agonized Loki. Technically the wound wasn't *fatal*, but it also wasn't the sort of thing you ever fully recovered from. The scarab had done its work- Loki would never adventure again.\n\nLoki locked eyes with the jiggling mass of Jello Shot, and asked one last thing of him.\n\n&gt;&gt; \"Fire me out of your cannon, you jiggly bastard.\"\n\nAfter a great amount of sorrow-laden argument, Jello Shot obliged, stuffing Loki into his favorite- and most dangerous- cannon, and aiming it in the right direction. Then, he casted True Strike, and fired.\n\nLoki flew over the short expanse of the comet, and came down exactly where he needed to be- an open rift to another dimension. As he tumbled through, legs breaking from the impact, he flopped over the rail of an otherwordly airship and began to fall a long, long way, toward a growing patch of ice on the distant grount below.\n\nAnd as Loki slammed into the Lich, he detonated every single bomb he had on him. Every alchemist's fire, every pellet grenade, every rogue talent and class feature, every damn one, in one final \"fuck you\" to the creature responsible for killing him.\n\nThere was a long, long moment of silence for the departed comrade.\n\n-----\n\nA fe weeks later, a local NPC questgiver informed the party that, hey, there was a crazy tendency for things to suddenly catch fire in the local area, almost as though some arsonist was randomly walking past flammable things, and hey, this hypothetical arsonist was walking toward places that we all care about! Ling Ling, Jello Shot, and Krag the well-spoken orcish fighter were sent out to make it not be happening, and the rather downcast party practically jumped at the chance to find and murder some arsonist to take out some emotional pressure.\n\nOn the way there, Krag ran into another party of orcs, and the warlord seemed to recognize Krag. Suspicious. The greasy warlord helpfully pointed out the way to the burning building, and encouraged the party to hurry before the place collapsed completely. Sure enough, at the end of the path there was indeed a building that was very much at fire, and from inside was the sound of a young girl crying. Well, that settled that, they were going in! Ling Ling and Krag took the stairs, while Jello Shot took the balcony. And there, at the heart of the flames, was a small, waifish girl, crying inconsolably in the heart of an inferno, with fire streaming out of one of her eyes.\n\nWell, despite the odd circumstances, things had to be done- Krag barreled in, scoffing at the pathetic damage caused by the nonmagical fire, snatched up the confused child and darted for the stairs- only to be intercepted by the shady orc warlord from before, stepping out from a shadow and smashing Krag very hard in the kneecap with a greathammer, just before vanishing once more into the smoke and flames.\n\nThe entire building was a rat trap, but Krag had focused HARD on his greatsword specialization. He passed the child on to Ling Ling, found a nice, reasonably non-flamy corner, and prepared an action to murderstab anything that presented itself. The warlord darted out of a shadow, and was very surprised to find a giant hunk of metal traveling very fast into his arm even before he could get off a swing. Swing he did, though, and Krag's leg gave way under the abuse as the warlord poofed away again.\n\nLing Ling, in the meantime, was having a difficult time getting out of the burning building. She would go for a window, and find arrows and spells whizzing toward her. And jumping was a non-issue- someone had grown spiky poisonous brambles all around the place. The enemy had a ranger. Well, Ling Ling was  a ranger too, and she employed her own magic to clear a patch of bramble and soften the ground enough for a decent leap to safety. She did so, and came face-to-face with the enemy spellcaster, right before his turn- and was completely surprised when the little girl she had been carrying raised a hand and shot two Scorching Rays into his face, point-blank.\n\nJello Shot, largely unconcerned by things like \"brambles\", \"poison\", \"fire\" and \"arrows\", made his own way down the building to lend some assistance by chasing away the enemy ranger at cannonpoint.By which I mean, he fired his seige cannon directly into the enemy ranger, and the enemy ranger went away at a very rapid speed.\n\nKrag was still having trouble with his shadowy opponent, who kept darting through shadows to deny Krag the opportunity to make a full attack. But Krag had the Hit Points and the Armor Class to make him an incredibly difficult target if he was on guard, and eventually managed to convince the enemy warlord to go after easier game. Path finally cleared, he leapt out of the window and onto his injured leg, cursing all the while. When he hit the ground, he was in a prime position to see Ling Ling getting whalloped with a monstrous blow from the warlord's hammer.\n\nThe little girl dropped from Ling Ling's arms, and might have made a very appealing target indeed if she hadn't immediately summoned up a wall of flames around herself that completely killed any chance of shadowjumping or even approaching, and Ling Ling's followup volley with her rifle was enough to put the already-injured warlord on the ropes. And when he used the last of his shadowjumping to regroup with the rest of his team, he found that his subordinates were on fire and being chased away by a very irate Jello Shot, repsectively. Whereupon Jello Shot dropped his cannon and proceeded to introduce the struggling warlord to a world of hurt, and by extension, a world of burning acidic dissolution.\n\nBut all of this was beside the point- there was a collapsing house and a roaring great fire going on, and the party hastily decided that they would be better off elsewhere. Krag grabbed the mysterious fiery girl, Ling Ling whistled up her Hippogriff mount, and Jello Shot devoured a trail of plant life through the woods as they made a hasty retreat, with Jello Shot brandishing the unconscious warlord (having not killed him for the sake of Ling Ling's conscience) and Krag struggling to hold a very hot little girl who kept insisting that Krag was \"new Daddy\".\n\nAnd thus, the party met [Cinder Sparks, the changeling oracle with a fiery streak and an unfortunate habit of burning down the homes of people who tried to be nice to her](http://imgur.com/Emday0T). Oh, and being generally unchildlike and vaguely creepy. She browbeat Krag into effectively adopting her and permanently adding herself to the team, because apparently they occasionally needed some help destroying things and **BOY HOWDY WAS SHE EVER GOOD AT THAT**. Their considerable wealth also meant that the party could afford protective equipment for young Cinder, as well as a fire-retardant room for her to sleep in when she wasn't dragging people in to attend creepy tea parties and get second-degree burns.\n\nAnd so, the adventures continued, and though there was sadness, life went on.\n\nEspecially for the Lich, who had not been killed by the explosion but was now literally incandescent with rage.

        "text": "Right. So me and a load of friends were in a dungeon. I'm a human wizard, and I got split from the rest of the group along with another human, an archer named Talion.\n\n(I'm Blaze, by the way.)\n\nTalion and I are walking down this corridor, and both of us fail a perception roll. I walk straight into a spike trap; bleeding out on the floor, I get handed a sickly yellow potion as a last-ditch attempt to live.\n\nI turn into a snail. 1hp, but I can still use all my spells. Talion picks me up, puts me in his bag, and then walks forward... into ANOTHER trap, this time a wall-crushy trap. He manages to escape, though. He takes one step forward, and triggers YET ANOTHER trap, another spike trap, which ratchets down his health.\n\nFast-forward to slightly later, where we have freed another member of our party (a dwarf, Rakus). We're now facing off against a wyvern and several human cultists. Rakus clubs the wyvern, Talion shoots one of the humans and kills them, and now it's my turn. I elect to have Talion throw me at this huge flying lizard, at which point I will cast flame hands, taking out the wyvern and the 2 other humans. Thankfully, I pull off the maneuver, and I'm on the floor with a dragon on 1hp hovering over me.\n\nLet me just say that again. I'm a snail, sitting underneath a wyvern that's about 700 times larger than I am, that is very, VERY aware of my existence. If so much as one talon scrapes my back, I'm dead... for good.\n\nThe wyvern rolls a 5. I'm safe.\n\nThen Talion shoots it in the eye, and it howls and rears back, giving Talion enough time to scoop me up before I'm crushed under the bulk of the sky lizard.\n\nThe potion's effects were only temporary, however. Still, the legend of Blaze the Exploding Snail lives on in infamy to this very day.",

The door was locked. Our fighter decided to bluff a secret knock and rolls a nat 20. The door opens. We are greeted by a 10 ft 650 lbs ogre. He asks what we're doing there. I roll to disguise as an ogre and bluff.\n \"We're here for the party\"\n\n\n\"Welcome in, I was wondering when people would start showing up\"\n\n\nUpon entering we find a huge buffet and 3 tier cake that said \"happy birthday to my best friend Bark\" Knowing full well that every other ogre in the encampment was dead we decided to stay and see how far we could take our little joke. I get him drunk and get him all hyped up for the party, the wizard sets up a noose, and our fighter shuts the door. A couple hours pass and no one shows up. While I stay with the ogre the wizard starts writing up a runaway note from the ogre whom the party is for. The note says \"I can't believe you ever thought we were friends. I can't stand you. I'm leaving with the others. By the way my name is Bjork jackass not Bark. You've been saying it wrong for years you dumb fuck.\"\n\nAfter reading the note he becomes extremely depressed and begins to eat the entire cake. While he does this I run off and create a harness around my chest that will support my weight. I return without saying a word and set up my own noose. I look at the ogre and say \"This party sucks no wonder Bjork left.\" I kick the chair out from under me and bluff dying. The ogre, heartbroken at my words and the desertion of his best friend, looks up to see the noose the wizard set up earlier. He decides life isn't worth living and hangs himself. I cut myself free and we loot his body.\n\nWe killed the big boss without ever drawing our weapons.",

        "text": "I'm just copy and pasting the post here.\n\nFought a half Orc where the other half was part ogre. He was a king of a country that revolved around being the strongest fighter possible. Also one of the few places where half breeds were fully welcome (playing as a half Orc bloodrager who wandered as a vagabond because nowhere wanted him my character felt at home there)\n\nUnfortunately we needed his kingdom to join us and fight the supreme King. He said beat me in a one on one fight. Being the party damage dealer I had to. Luckily before hand out party thief sneaks into the kitchen disguised as a maid. He poisons the Kings food with 3 black lotus extract that had been given to us by the rebel leaders to help us in the inevitable fight. (The King solved every argument with a fight. You committed a crime? Fight the judge. You and you're neighbor are in a land dispute? Fight your neighbor. You were dissatisfied with a glass of ale? Fight the bar maid and the brewer. ) the poison did 1d6 Con damage per round. Our thief sneaked it into his keg of ale. Luckily. \n\nThe King had a character sheet and everything. \nHP: 567\nSTR32\nCON41\nDEX23\nINT:8\nWIS12\nCHA:4\n\nI was a level 9 bloodrager with\nHP:107\nSTR:29 while raging (with belt of ogres strength)\nCon:16\nDex:14\nInt:12\nWis:8\nCHA:15\n\nHe had a myriad of weapons on his back with wood handles (all huge size to fit him). The wood handles broke easily (my character seen him fight the day before. I luckily managed to guess he had some feats that revolved around him breaking his weapons)\n\nFor round 1 I cast my two highest damage spells doing 77 damage (He has high reflex so managed to dodge it but the spell is either full damage or dodge and take half damage. He avoided both castings of lightning bolt) one of my team mates from the side slyly casts melt armour on his face plate. He now takes 1d6 damage per round of fire. \nHis turn. He charges but his movement is just not enough to get me. (This includes his 20ft reach with a hand mace)\n\nRound 2. Team mate casts bungle on the King. \nThe King starts groaning. He hunched over a little. \nI use meteoric collision dealing 24 damage and successfully make him flat-footed (we decided that it would be impossible for me to knock him down. )\n\nI then strike him with my weapon (3d6 slashing 2d6 lighting  [which had an extra half die roll extra so it was 3d6 because of his armour]) and get a crit. He receives double damage. 1d6 of bleeding AND my GM goes \"you also slice right through his weapon. You find that the wood is extremely frail. \" this cemented the thought that he will have weapon sundering feats.  Overall he takes 66 damage. \nHis turn. He takes a further 2d6 Fire and bleeding damage. He draws out his great hammer. (Size of a fucking building.) rolls 1. I am send flying. His weapon is lost from his grip and sent into the crowd. I also receive half damage. I received 66. :(\n\nHe then starts clutching his stomach he is now in visible pain. \n\nRound 3. I am now 60ft away. Luckily I landed on my feet. I use scorching ray twice sending 6 beams at him (my DM rounds up with numbers. So I got the third Ray at level 9) so I deal 24d6 of damage here. I deal 89 damage here\nTeam mate casts melt armour again. His chest plate starts burning him for an extra 1d6 per round\nMy thief uses her daily ability to blind enemies. Rolls a 1 and blinds herself. (She had used this spell 3 times now. Every time blinding herself. )\n\nThe King starts coughing up blood. It is visible that his stomach is in agony but the crowd believes it to be the melting armour.  He charges at me again. Now with a spear. He manages to pin me to a wall dealing 33 damage. \n\nThen the fucking feat takes effect. He can break any weapon he has and his attack is now a critical. \n\nWe roll the generator. Lost limb. My left arm is severed. Raggedly. I'm now taking 2d6 bleed a turn. \n\nAs a last ditch I use bloody ripost. I deal 31 damage. \nAnd a further 1d6 of bleed\n\nRound 4\n\nI am now unconscious from the bleed. But Orc ferocity gets me one last action. I have no spell uses left. I use devastating rush and get another 2d6 damage. I score another 35 damage. \n\nHis turn. He takes 4d6 of bleed and fire. He pulls out a great axe. But before he can do anything he drops to the ground. He grabs at his semi liquid helmet and rips it off gasping for breath. Then begins to froth at the mouth. \n\nThe crowd is silent. I realise I will not be able to survive. I can't stop the bleeding and no one can get to me in time. I then reach into my pocket and pull out a small scroll of paper. And clench it in my hand. And then I finally collapse. \n\nParty then finds the scrap of paper. They read the name on the scroll. The thief feels some weight to it. They hand it to my chronicoller. She was also a skald and a badass , built like an Orc but was completely human. She opens it up and reads silently. She had a key in her hand that fell out of the scroll. Starts crying and runs to our caravan. She finds my cart and opens up a chest with the key. Pulls out a great axe that was crafted by Griffanies (parody of Tiffanys). Jeweled. Gold inscriptions and linings. Masterwork. The party asks what the fuck? Turns out my character hadn't been spending any of the loot we were getting. He had been saving it up to buy a wedding ring for the skald. Realised that a ring was pretty useless for a skald. Decides to buy a badass weapon then. Was planning on marrying the skald and running off together away from the war. (I was going to retire the character either way. The DM was cool with it. ) \n\nTwo days later the skald is packing up and leaves. Before she goes hands the note to the group. They read it. I wrote out an entire thing but the gist of it was this. \n\nMy character had become tired of everything. The fighting. The xenophobia. The frequent near death encounters. He says he was wanting to run away with her. That this was to be his last fight. Either way it turned out. He then apologises over and over for not winning. That he won't be able to live the last of his Orcish days with her (my half Orc was only 18 but began being a vagabond at 9. He had no idea how old he was. Only knew that half orcs have very short lifespans like orcs. Legitimately thought he had a couple years left in him). \n\nThis was a couple weeks ago. Kinda glad he didn't get retired in the initial way. The story was far better this way",

        "text": "It was raining when Blue finally came home to Red Rocket. He was soaked to the bone, and the outfit he'd taken to wearing recently was riddled with bullet holes, though whether Blue himself had taken any damage she couldn't tell.\n\n\"Blue, come on, doll, get inside before the cold snaps all my favorite parts off of you,\" she said, ushering him inside. She took off his sodden clothes and hung them over the fire in the workshop, then turned back to check him for injuries. Nothing too major, but something about the look in his eyes worried her; they were half-glazed over, out of focus, like he was far beyond the point of exhaustion. He looked more than tired; he looked *beaten*.\n\n\"Blue?\" she asked him, cupping his face in her hand. \"Baby? What's wrong?\"\n\nHis eyes roused at the sound of her voice, and he looked at her for a solid minute, saying nothing, before getting up and grabbing a change of clothes.\n\n\"Nothing,\" came the monotone reply as Blue pulled on his shirt and pants, \"Just tired from the long walk home. We can't all make a living behind a typewriter, y'know. I'll be in the shop.\" he added over his shoulder as he grabbed three beers from the mini-fridge by his desk.\n\nThat last part stung Piper, but she shook it off, attributing it to his exhaustion. \"Well, maybe next time you can take me with you,\" she called back playfully, to no response. She didn't bother thinking about it and set about checking the plants outside, making sure none of them were too badly damaged before coming back inside and fixing herself a nice hot cup of coffee.\n\nThree hours later, the rain had stopped, and Blue came back into the bedroom, dragging behind him a bright-red doghouse, with \"Dogmeat\" etched onto the front of it in stylized letters. He sat down on the mattress with a creak, and rubbed his face, running his fingers through his hair with a sigh that sounded like the death rattle of an old man who had seen too much of the ugliness in the world.\n\n\"Hey there, tiger,\" Piper cooed, sidling next to Blue and wrapping her arm around his broad shoulders. \"You've been acting odd today. Everything alright?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just tired,\" Blue placated, but his eyes were screaming *\"No I'm not fine, I am about as far from fine as I can be!\"*.\n\n\"Blue, please. I've known you long enough to see when you're hiding something from someone,\" Piper cajoled. \"C'mon, spill it. I promise I won't try to spin a story out of it. Unless it's really juicy,\" she added with a playful smirk that vanished as soon as she saw the look on Blue's face.\n\n\"Fine,\" Blue acquiesced with a long, deep sigh. \"You wanna know what happened? I failed someone, Piper. They trusted me, they *relied* on me for help, and I failed them, and now they're dead and it's my fault.\"\n\n\"W-what are you talking about?\"\n\nAnother sigh. \"I was in Goodneighbor on a job. I picked up a radio signal on my Pip-Boy, told me to come to the Memory Den. I went and met a guy named Kent. He offered me a job, asked me to help clean up Goodneighbor's crime problem. Have you heard of the Silver Shroud?\"\n\n\"Silver--you mean that old radio show?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Blue nodded. \"I used to listen to it before...well, before the shit hit the fan. It was campy as hell, but I loved it. Anyway...they were planning on making a Silver Shroud television show, too, before...y'know. Kent wanted me to go to the studio where they were filming it and get the costume they were using, and run around shooting bad guys while shouting the Shroud's catchphrase.\"\n\n\"Sounds like an interesting fellow,\" Piper chuckled.\n\n\"You don't know the half of it,\" Blue nodded in agreement. \"Aside from the whole 'shooting and getting shot at' part, I actually had fun playing the part. I...anyway...I get back after one of his contracts and I hear a different message on the radio. One calling out the Shroud...calling *me* out.\"\n\n\"Oh, God...\" gasped Piper.\n\n\"They wanted me to come meet the guy behind all of the smaller criminal activities I'd been stopping, and if I didn't, they were gonna kill Kent. So I went. I went, I all but kowtowed to the guy, I told him he could do whatever he wanted to me, just let Kent go, Kent had nothing to do with it...and the bastard shot Kent right in front of me. I...my memory goes foggy after that, but when I came back around, I looked for Kent. I found him...three bullet holes in his head. He always sang my praises when I killed some chem pusher or mob enforcer, but when it came down to it, I couldn't...\"\n\n\"Shh, shh,\" Piper said, rubbing Blue's back. His head was in his hands, his eyes steadily dripping tears. \"You did what you could, sometimes it can't be hel--\" she was cut off by Blue standing up suddenly, staring at her like she'd just said his mother smelled of elderberries.\n\n\"You don't *get* it, Piper!\" he exclaimed. \"I *failed*! It's not about Kent, it's not about the Silver Fucking Shroud! Someone put their life in my hands, and I let it fall through my fingers like sand! I...I...\" Blue's shoulders slumped, and he sank into a crouched position. \"I...It's...It's Nora and Shaun all over again. I was in the perfect position to save them, and I couldn't measure up, and now Nora's *dead*, and Shaun's probably been sold into slavery...and...and I can't...I can't even begin to think of where to even *begin* to look for him...\" Blue buried his face in his hands, sobbing quietly. \"All I've done since the bombs fell was fuck up. I couldn't save my wife, couldn't save my kid...my biggest success has been managing not to die. It's just...I can't...I don't know if I can keep going, Piper. I just, I can't.\"\n\nPiper looked at the man she loved, huddled into a ball, sobbing like a small child, and it hit her; she wasn't the only one who had lost someone to the Wasteland. Blue had lost so much more than she could ever hope to have. She knelt down beside him and squeezed him tightly.\n\n\"You're going to keep going,\" she assured him, stroking his hair and rubbing his back. \"That's just the kind of guy you are. No matter how much you may be hurting on the inside, you patch yourself up and soldier on, because you'd rather die than let anyone else feel the kind of pain you're feeling. I think that's why Kent asked you for help. He saw that in you. I see it in you, Cait sees it, even MacCready sees it. That's why we're all so drawn to you. Just...You need to realize that we're here to help you, too. You don't need to shoulder the full weight of everyone's burdens. That's what friends are for, doll.\"\n\nBlue could only sit there, sobbing brokenly. Piper didn't move, either. They both sat on the floor, holding each other, as the sunset turned the sky outside a magnificent mixture of blood red and deep violet.",

        "text": "WARNING!! THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE HOARD OF THE DRAGON QUEEN CAMPAIGN. IF YOU HAVE NOT KILLED PHARBLEX, DO NOT READ!! If you do, and you metagame, horrible centipedes will emerge from the nail beds of your toes and consume your skin. Be warned!!\n\nTl,dr: Check EVERYTHING for traps. Clerics? Prepare Lesser Restoration every morning. Make that a mandatory spell.\n\nSo, as the warning says, I'm part of a party that is running the Hoard of the Dragon Queen campaign in 5e. Today, we were missing three people for various reasons, so the cast only includes the following:\n\nMe, Dwarven cleric of Liira. The guy keeping everyone alive, barely.\n\nHuman ranger specializing in swords.\n\nHalf dragon sorcerer. She casts spells.\n\nThe Gnome Wizard. This guy has a wisdom score of 8, and he plays it. Oh, how he plays it.\n\n\n\nSo, as we're playing through, we stumble across Pharblex and his entourage. Since we're missing half a party, we take some time to talk amongst ourselves and decide whether or not to try and take him. Our gnome rolled a 21 on initiative, and busted out his 4th level fireball. This clears out the entourage and heavily weakens the boss. Long story short, in one round we cleared out a huge fight that should have been a challenge.\n\nFINAL SPOILER WARNING! THINGS GET SPOILERY AFTER THIS!\n\nAfter we kill the froggy thing, and give the gnome a bitchin' sweet hat made of a crocodile head, we move into the next room and see a box. The ranger opens it. No investigation, no search, no nothing. Just \"Hurr durr, box has a lid!\"\n\nHe opens it.\n\nSix ceramic jars fall off the ceiling, two break, and everyone has to make a constitution save against poison. Being a dwarf, I make the save. Everyone else? They immediately begin hallucinating. Everyone they see is a horrible frog thing. Each round, they roll a die for even or odd. On an odd roll, they have to flee to the water and submerge themselves. On an even roll, they attack the nearest thing to them.\n\nHoo boy.\n\nThe wizard and the sorcerer immediately scream in abject horror and flee to the central cave, where there's a huge lake thing. The ranger? He attacks me, the cleric. \n\nHe rolls so high, guys. So high. He dealt almost three quarters of my health in one round, filleting me with two attacks. \n\nI barely survive, and on my round, I make a touch attack for a Lesser Restoration spell, and tell him, \"Stop tha gnome an' tha dragon!\"\n\nThankfully that's enough to get him going.\n\nNext round, the gnome continues fleeing as fast as his stubby legs can go, but the sorcerer rolls even, and gets an attack of opportunity off. Gnome has a reflexive spell that gives him an AC of 20, so no damage. I fire off a Hold Person, and stop the half dragon, using my last second level spell slot to restore her, again telling her to stop the gnome.\n\nNow, in this central room, there is a giant frog. Every time we've walked through this room, that frog has eyeballed the gnome in a hungry sort of way.\n\nThe gnome now has line of sight on the frog, and rolls even.\n\nHe must attack the giant frog.\n\nHe gets a fireball off, but rolls mostly low. The frog survives, and swallows the gnome. The party helpfully informs me that the gnome has been stopped.\n\nOur ranger manages to get a clean arrow off on the frog, and kills it. I hold my actions until the sorcerer can manage a strength check to open the frog enough so that I can get line of sight on the gnome, and cast another Hold Person on him, followed by a Lesser Restore.\n\nThis single trap cost me six spell slots. All of my second and third level spells, gone. Poof. I have no idea how we would have survived if I had failed that first touch attack. After the fact, we were told that the poison would last for ten minutes. Ten. Alternating between drowning ourselves and killing ourselves, there was no coming back from that.\n\nMoral of the story: CHECK FOR TRAPS!! KNOCKING ON THE LID DOES NOT CONSTITUTE CHECKING FOR TRAPS!!",

        "text": "Big fan of Dishonored, so on my 3rd play through, I decided I'd go for clean hands, not killing anyone. \n\nFirst mission starts, need to assassinate High Overseer Campbell. Whatever, I think, I'll brand him, and maybe save that Currow guy.\n\nSneak all the way to the meeting room, \"accidentally\" knock over the wine, and hide under the table.\n\nAfter a brief conversation about how terrible the maids are, Campbell and Currow are unconscious.\n\nDespite this being my 3rd play through, I was absolutely sure that if the guards found the bodies, they would wake Campbell and kill Currow. So it was time to hide the bodies.\n\nI planned to save Currow first, so I left him where he was to take care of hiding Campbell. I decided the safest place for Campbell would be on top of the cabinets in the very same room.\n\nI blink up there, crouch down, and gently lay down Campbell. To my horror, he starts slipping. For a few seconds, I can only stare in awe of what is happening. Then I burst into action, trying to grab him\n\nShit, shit, shit, shit, shit\n\nI fail. Campbell's body falls head first off of the tall cabinet to the ground. I hear a thump as he lands. For a split second, I think it will be alright, he didn't die. Then, much like Campbell's skull, my hopes are shattered as a sign pops up in the upper right corner: Target Assassinated.",

With aliens and marines trying to win it out with a dealthmatch.\n3 upcoming servers, one just went live today, it's a fallout themed thing, it's really early on. 2 other ones are based off FTL.\n\nAnyway, back to the story. The story starts within a small server of yogstation 13. I get the job of Research Director, a head of a department, that department being the science area of the station. Now there is things called antags within Space Station 13. It's a role where you get objectives, and maybe some special something something in order to do those objectives.\n\nI got traitor antag, traitor get a uplink passcode and if they imput that into there PDA then they can buy items with TC's. Everyone get's 20 TC's. As i was RD, i thought i should get a hacked law up loader. See there's this AI that can access almost everyone onto the station, the AI also has borgs that are controled by the AI. See where i'm going with this?\n\nAs RD, i have access to a AI law uploader, so i build it, i upload a law that the AI is under my control, and also the borgs. Now i got the AI on my side, i send borgs to kill the shaft miner that my objective says i have to kill. All goes well in till the Chief Engineer  (the leader of the engineer's and repairs and stuff), try's to make a new AI.... The current AI is the best AI, under my control and ready to do my bidding.\n\nI stunned him down, threw him into the AI core, and then i just murdered him. My borgs threw him into space, but not before he told the crew i was rogue.... damn it. Thank god no one cared. Got searched because people said i was rouge. My borg's find my target dead in space. Due to something to the murder bone rule, i couldn't order the AI to kill everyone... \n\nThat's not even touching the top of how many rounds i have played. I played this round today. I played so many rounds and every round is different.\n\nSpace Station 13.... the ride never ends. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4xrwni/how_my_party_died_from_a_joke_or_its_just_a_prank/",
        "text": "To start of, I will preface with a few things to properly introduce the backdrop to this now colossal misunderstanding. We have a Rogue (Noren), a Barbarian (Snek), two Bards (Vrock and Kainsly), and an Eldritch Night (Ballsi). Also have one other character that lives for literally 30 minutes in game. Noren (the Rogue) is the only character that has survived from the last campaign arc, and is now on a quest for Redemption because of the actions he took (leading to 2 Party Member deaths). All other characters know his deeds, with varying levels of disapproval except for the Barbarian, who has actually bonded with the Rogue over their 2 months journey to the city.\n\nSo the characters are on the outskirts of the city of Esgaroth, currently helping the Sentinels, who are Demon Hunters currently employed to seal a Rift that has opened up near the city. While down in the catacombs beneath an ancient Temple complex, they run into the cavern that the Rift is open in, after a brief fight with a Bone Devil, Chain Devil, and some Barbed Devils. They are about 100 ft up on the edge of a cliff overlooking the cavern below, which is described as to have 'about a 100 demons of varying sizes.' Vrock mentions that he casts fly on himself, drifting out over the cavern, and makes a perception check to see if he spots anything abnormal. Rolls an 8. Tell him he sees the army below, but he fails to notice the Erinyes up near the roof, who was scouting out the terrain. She sees him. Vrock is a squishy bard, AC 14.\n\nShe hits all three of her attacks with room to spare, and immediately knocks Vrock unconscious. He starts plummeting and I roll some die, decide that he plummets into the portal, being taken to whatever is on the other side. Party immediately goes into crisis mode. They like Vrock, would even be willing to do a lot of things for him, but after some discussion, it seems jumping into Hell after him isn't one of those things. Then Ballsi jumps in after him, deciding that he can do two things; help the Sentinels and help the Bard. The rest of the party reluctantly follows suit, all making the 150 ft drop.\n\nVrock's player proceeds to roll up a new character, a Battlemaster called John Bastille, as Vrock has perished from the fall. Decides that his character is trapped in Hell as punishment for trying to lead a Revolution against his liege-lord. This is session 1 of 2. And the short part of the story.\n\nNext week, we start off with every character noticing that they are alone, in a different part of the first level of Hell. Snek is on a smooth plain, next to the River Styx, which I descride with varying bits of Flotsam and decayed flesh and a very, very acidic smell. Noren is on a rocky outcrop, overlooking the ancient battlefields strewn with dead and broken pieces of armor and weapons. Ballsi is in a howling cave, with the wind biting at his skin. None of them have any idea where they are, or where their party members are. John Bastille is currently locked in a prison in Hell, being tortured by a rather large and disgustingly ugly beast.\n\nNoren immediately starts picking out equipment in the battlefield that he can wear, and uses his disguise kit to hide himself. Rolls a 23 to make it convincing that he belongs here. Proceeds to skirt around the edge of the legion of devils, searching for the portal that he had come through. Manages to make my hordes of devils and demons look like children playing hide and seek with a trained spy.\n\nSnek decides to follow the river downstream, hoping it would lead him to some sort of civilazation. After a few miles walk, he spots the basalt citadel of Zariel, with the river splitting and acting as a moat for the fortress. Asks if there is a bridge that spans the gap and sees one, covered with enemies currently marching out of the gates. Decides that he will try and swim, so sticks his hand in the water to see if its safe. Ask him to roll a Con save. Nat 1's it, but has a +8 modifier, so I ask him to make an Wis save (his Wis is 9). Rolls a 2. So it takes him a moment to notice that his skin is starting to dissolve (ever stick your hand in hot water, and it feels cold for a second?), and lets out a huge howl that echoes across the landscape. He goes down to about 35 HP.\n\nBallsi lands in a pitch black cavern (no darkvision). Can't see, so decides to use dancing lights to illuminate his way. Spends quite a bit of time tumbling every which way, before finding the exit, but not before being ambushed by 3 Hell Hounds. He manages to kill them, but they take him down from 85ish to 30ish HP. Drinks a couple health potions as he steps out into the light of Hell. Sees he is on the edge of a mountain range, with no river in sight, but a contingent of demons marching Eastward.\n\nJohn Bastille is chained up to a wall, being tortured. While he is there, uses his ability Know Your Enemy to find out the demon torturing him is cocky and sure of himself, so he challenges him to a game of Dice, for his freedom or his soul, rolls 17 for persuasion. Demon relunctantly agrees, promising HE would let him free. Game is best of Five rolls. First two rolls go to the Demon, with John taking the last two. On the fifth one, the Demon rolls a 15 to John 11, so he asks if he can sleight of hand the result. I say sure, and he rolls a 16, managing to get past the Demons 12 perception and rerolls his dice. Nat 20's it. (These 20's get ridiculous by the end of the night.) John books it, deciding to stop by the armory and try to pick up his weapons, but proceeds to run into Every. Single. Patrol. Books it to the exit instead. When he gets there, he manages to convince one of the guards outside to open the door (Guard 1 rolled a 16 for insight, Guard 2 rolled a 1), and barrels past out into the open, staring down the edge of a cliff, with a small goat path being the only way down the 500 feet. Decides he has nothing to lose, so starts picking his way down.\n\nAs Noren is scouting around, trying to find the way out, he hears Sneks' howl, and starts off towards the sound, also following the river.\nAs Snek is desperately trying to figure out someway to stop his arm from dissolving, 4 bearded Devils come over to investigate, managing to sneak up on Snek. He decides to Rage so he won't be surprised and we roll initiative. As a Barbarian, he gets advantage, and rolls 1's on both die. Devils go first, and knock him down to 23 HP. Snek pulls out his Javelins, and does a good job a hurting one of them. Next round, the Devils get him down to 14 HP. He decides to use reckless attack, and rolls a 14 and a crit on the first attack. 1 dies. Second attack rolls crit's on both die. Asks to make one more attack (House rule for 3 Nat 20s is instakill). Rolls a fucking 9 and a crit. Manages to kill the 3 unhurt devils in one round, and kills the other in a Opportunity Attack as it tries to run away. About a minute later, Noren runs up, sees Snek's now mostly fleshy arm, and cuts it off. Feeds him all their health pots. Ask Snek to roll a Con save against the shock. Gets a 25. (By this point I'm done with Snek and his stupid luck.)\n\nBack to John, he picks his way down the cliff, nearly falling himself but managing to catch himself before he plummets. All the Barbed devils chasing him roll below a 10 on their Dex checks, and he successfully kills them all by being the only one to hold on to the rock. He gets to the bottom and notices a human standing off about 100 feet away from him at the mouth of a small cave. Investigates and finds Ballsi, whom both become fast friends, being the only ones in Hell and not a demon.\n\nThey decide to follow the contingent of Demons Ballsi saw earlier, deducting that they must be marching towards the portal out of here. They decide to skirt around the edge, trying to stay out of sight and away from anymore patrols. Both roll a 6 for stealth. So as they are trying to duck down behind the small ravines and large boulders around the area, they run into a Succubus and Incubus . Neither side attacks right away, and John tries to skirt around them, being as diplomatic as possible. Succubus asks him to stay awhile and enjoy one more sin before he leaves, trying to charm him. John saves, and declines. Incubus walks over to Ballsi, offering him some beer. Ballsi fails the save. Then fails his first Indomitable. Then fails the second one too. Decides a beer is a great idea as it's fucking hot in Hell. Succubus realizes John isn't failing for it and decides to attack, but misses easily. John spends his turn trying to get Ballsi to snap out of it, before deciding to just attack back, managing to do some damage. Ballsi is next up, and attacks John six times, critting twice. Deals 70 damage in one round, dropping John to -3, killing the new player who had only been alive in this world for about 30 minutes. Two characters in two sessions for this player. Ballsi is then murdered by the twins, enjoying his untimely demise all the way. 2 of 4 out for the count.\n\nBack to Noren and Snek. Noren uses his disguise kit on Snek, dressing him up the same as himself. Rolls a 26 for it. On their way back up the river, Noren finds a War Pick, and decides that it'd be a great idea to tie it to Snek's now stubby arm. As they get closer to the hub of demon activity, they decide to climb up the side of the mountain to stay away from the hordes walking along the ravine, the only known way in or out of the valley up ahead.\n\nA few climb checks later, they managed to find the valley itself, and notice in the center, in the midst of a Stonehenge type ruin, is the Portal they came through. Surrounding the ruins is a small lake, with a single iron bridge connecting the two, on which a battle was currently being fought. They need to cross the river, so go back to a Rope bridge they saw earlier to try and cross, but run into a squad of demons guarding both ends. Noren goes up to convince the guards they are on important business, but as he has no idea about anything in Hell, I give him disadvantage. Rolls a 19 and a 20, for a 21 persuade. (While laughing his ass off \"I'm sorry for breaking your game DM. I'm sorry I'm not letting you kill me.\" Grumble grumble) Demons roll a 19 insight, so they let them pass, with a lot of dirty looks and unconvinced minds. On the other side, the are stopped again. Tells these guys the same thing, rolls a 19 for persuade. Demons roll an 18. Gets off Scot-free. Drags the Barbarian with him.\n\nNow they only have to get past the battle line. They manage to push their way to the front with some strength checks, and both take a 6th level Lightning Bolt to the face. Barbarian goes down to 1 thanks to Relentless Endurance, Rogue is now at 7 HP. Rogue dances his way over the line as the Barbarian charges through, ripping off their disguises and running into one of the Captains of the Sentinels, who is organizing the defense on this side of the Portal, trying to shut it down. Captain also happens to be Kainslys' sister (not mentioned yet) who has been searching for her for 3 years, and had just recently been re-united for a brief hour conversation. Captain tells the two to get through the Portal (they're useless anyway now, everything is spent), but before they do, the run into two Teiflings and the Erinyes, who have just stepped through. All of them are bloodied and breathing heavily. Noren asks what these two are doing here (as he had met them previously a few times and currently had a mutual beneficial deal with them), and they tell him they are hear on business. Offer to let Noren and Snek live, if he promises to fulfil his end of the bargain. Noren agrees, and they both jump through the Portal, which promptly shut behind them.\n\nNow Kainsly (whose player had not been here the week previous) was on the other side of the portal as it closed, watching Noren and Snek come through, both basically dead men walking. He is currently invisible, as he was not a fighter, and was trying to find a way through to save his sister from what he thought was a fate forced on her.\n\nHe waited until Noren and Snek were alone, and cast Sleep on Noren, asking Snek to trust him for the time being. He thens takes the three of them off to the edge of the woods, away from the Temple Complex. About 15 minutes later, they both hear a Dragon swoop down from the sky, destroying the Temple, and presumably burying everyone inside.\n\nKainsly casts Mordenkain Magic Mansion, and Snek promptly falls asleep. Kainsly then ties up Noren in a dungeon, and waits for him to wake up to interogate him. He then discovers \n\n* 1. Noren had gone into Hell with the rest of the Party. \n* 2. Noren had not come out with the rest of the Party. \n* 3. Noren had run into Kainsly's sister on the other side of the Portal. \n* 4. Noren and Snek had decided to not help his sister against the Teiflings and Erinyes \n* 5. Had known something 'big' (the Dragon attack) was going to happen during his meeting with the Teiflings and Dragonborn. \n* 6. Had not decided to share any of this information with the Party.\n\nAs Noren had already had plenty of blood on his hands, and Kainsly's inability to react rationally in regards to bad news about his sister, Kainsly killed him. (4th PvP death in this campaign.) Kainsly's then went and got a full nights sleep.\n\nAt breakfast the next day, Kainsly decided to break the news about Noren's death to Snek, who was the only person Snek considered a friend. As Kainsly was finshing up, Snek decided he had heard enough. His supposed 'ally' had executed his friend for things outside his control, and subsequently threw his handaxe at him. Fucker crits, again, dropping Kainsly 33 HP out of 90, to 57. Kainsly responds with a 7th level Lightning Bolt, doing a measly 25 damage, thanks to Rage. Snek then uses a bonus action to bitchslap Kainsly with his War Pick hand, and crits. Deals another 39 damage, dropping Kainsly to 18 HP. He then hits him twice with his Hand Axe, dealing 13 and 8 damage, effectively ending Kainsly, and my entire party. \n\nThe Mansion spits them out as the spell fails, and Snek gathers himself and some belongings, and walks off to \"Became a fucking Pirate, cause fuck this Good guy bullshit.\"\n\nAfterwards, we were talking about how this all started, and we all ask why Vrock had decided to float out over the Cavern floor.\n\nVrock's player. \"What? Because Snek said he pushed me, and I decided I'd just fucking Fly cause I hadn't used it yet.\"\n\nSneks' Player. \"What?! I was kidding dude; it was just a joke. I didn't actually mean it.\"\n\nVrock's Player. \"I totally thought it was legit. I was drunk, you can't expect me to know you were kidding.\"\n\nOur 1 year and 3 month campaign ended last night, all because of a joke that got taken too far.\n\nI feel dead inside, and now I've got to create an entire new campaign to start for next weekend.\n\nBecause of a bad joke.",

        "text": "It's the weekend and I have nothing better to do, so here's another Snidley Whiplash story.\n\nSo after we had formed our odd party, we ended up in the mayor's office because of Snidley's collateral damage. Long story short, he said he'd pardon us if we played diplomat for a while because a town wasn't trading with anyone anymore.\n\nAlso, the girl from last time was reincarnated into the mayor's daughter. Her character had \"mutual mistrust\" for me and wanted to kick me out (I wonder why...) But otherwise we managed to get the quest and a new member of our party.\n\nWhile everyone else was going to this dude's shop to get a cart, Snidley went into the market. When they met up, Snidley had double his original bomb supply, a special fire lighter that only took a bonus action, and some basic adventure gear (bedroll, torches, etc). The Scout asks where I got them, since I started with 2GP cuz bombs. I reveal that I was texting the DM. Snidley secretly looted Maryn and stole all of her gear, then sold it to buy all this crud.\n\nThe girl goes double the ape she was before, since her character had some decent loot and I sold all of it for bombs (I had actually saved some money, just cuz) After a 2 minute yelling session, we got back on track.\n\nIn the game, her character tried to sic the guards on me, but the town is poor af and has no guards. Eventually, we manage to actually carry on with the adventure.\n\nRandom encounters screws us over and we fight random guys 3 times in this trek. One of the guys was actually a neutral group of hunters but Monk Shrek managed to tip him off and we fought.\n\nSnidley had a particular strategy where he would stand a distance away, light assorted explosives and throw them. Now this was a very party-unfriendly strategy, for all of the party, save for the Soldier and occasionally the Pyro, attacked from close range. In fact, I'm willing to bet they were more damaged by Snidley's bombs than any of the enemies.\n\nEventually, we manage to make it into the town. We all take a long rest, but when we wake up we hear someone yelling \"Dragon!\" and some dragon drops into the town.\n\nWe get into a fight cuz Paladin Shrek is an idiot. The DM obviously lowered the dragon's stats a little, but it was still kicking our butts. The only one who was doing fine was the fighter; everyone else was getting p0wned. The girl was healing quite well, though, and we were making progress. \n\nThen I get another idea. I carry all my bombs in a single bag, separate from my main bag (which was about 1/8 the size). I light a torch, drop it in the bag, and shake it a little. I text the Soldier, and when his turn comes, he says:\n\n\"I take Snidley's bomb bag, swing it around, and throw it at the dragon.\"\n\nThe reason I had the Soldier do this is because he had a Strength of 17, despite being a wizard, while I wasn't worth squat in that category. He rolls to throw it, and gets a 16 in total.\n\nIt lands in front of the dragon, sizzles for a second, then...\n\nKABOOM!!!\n\nWith the damage already on it, the dragon got its head ripped off by the explosion. The Pyro and Paladin Shrek got completely vaporized by the explosion, and were killed instantly. The Scout, Monk Shrek, and the mayor's daughter were knocked into the red. The only ones who were still conscious we're Snidley, the Soldier (who was too far away from the explosion) and the Fighter, who had a constitution of 19. The Fighter immediately stabilized the mayor's daughter, part because he didn't want to face the consequences, part because his character had a crush on her, and partly because he didn't want his GF to throw a third temper tantrum. Monk Shrek failed his saving throws and died, and the Scout managed to crit his saving throw and started an argument with the Fighter which ended with him getting knocked (safely) unconscious. Everyone who's character died started rolling up new characters.\n\nBut no, that wasn't the end. All of the bombs didn't go off at the same time. A few flied all over the place, destroying assorted buildings and patches of lands. After all of this, there was a massive gorge where the dragon was and all sorts of holes around the town. \n\nSo what did Snidely do? After using his high charisma rolls to sort it out with the mayor, he convinced them to start trading again. Everyone was relieved that Snidley was out of bombs. So once they got back to the original town, he used his remaining money to replenish his entire bomb supply.\n\nBoy, I wish I could've shown you their faces. Next time I'll talk about how Snidley started World War 3.",

        "text": "So our DM has been running the Hell’s Vengeance adventure path for us, but with her own additions. Our party starts off with Baron E Sandres, a useless dorky politician who has the demon lord Shax bound to his soul, and turns into him when his anger gets out of hand. Basically he’s a Bloodrager. We also have Shel, who endlessly confuses me because I keep referring to Cheliax as Chel. Shel is a “big buff lesbian orc sorceress” in her player’s own words. I’m playing Nogling von Kromp, who is the noble goblin son of the Duke and Duchess of the shining goblin city of Scraphole Bog. He is a goblin gunslinger, with the siege gunner archetype, and an unhealthy obsession with rocketry. He has been described more than once as “Peridot the Kerbal.”\n\nBe warned. There are a lot of Adventure Path spoilers ahead.\n\nSo in our first session we raided the Louslick Tannery, and fucked everything up by killing everyone and getting covered in shit. Really it’s quite uneventful, except for the fact that both von Kromp and Shel manage to kill a dog each, which briefly overwhelms Kromp with emotion, given that “dog-killer” is a prestigious goblin title.\n\nIn session 2, we went to the town square to quell a muttering mob. In front of the Church of Iomedae, the high priest and her twin sons are showing off the helmet of the Angel Knight. While Sandres goes to talk to the High Priest, who has gone into the church, Kromp keeps watch over the town square from a high window, ready to fire a bullet if shit gets real. Shel goes to talk to the twin priests and find out about the helmet. She walks up to them, rolls to flirt, and nat 1’s. Makes sense, she isn’t into dudes. On the other hand, she fails so hard the twins are scared of her. She decides to go for intimidation instead, and… nat 20’s. At this point she has forgotten what she’s supposed to be doing, both in and out of character. She panics… and picks up the Angel Knight’s helmet and leaves. You will notice that panicking and doing things will become a running theme here. Also Shel meets one of the DM’s new NPCs, Lucia, who is based on Sans from Undertale. Shel arranges a date with Lucia.\n\nLater that very same session, we met three… jolly fellows. These were inserted into the adventure path by the DM to add an interesting minor boss. They were Qlippoth cultists, left there as foreshadowing for when we were supposed to fight them… ten levels in the future. Turns out they can sense devils. And demons. They nearly bust out and murder Sandres in the middle of the bar, but decide to invite him stargazing on the hill outside town. Next to the river. Prime body-dumping real estate. Shel is on her date. Cimri (the NPC designed to escort the players through the early parts of the adventure path) reckons there’s something suspicious with Sandres, and convinces Kromp to go with her to protect Sandres.\n\nWe arrive at the foot of the hill in time to see Sandres getting clubbed unconscious. Kromp drops down to fire at them, and immediately misfires. By the time he is done clearing the gun, the cultists are nearly there. He fires twice more and misses both times. One of the cultists raises an ice wall around the hill.\n\nKromp scales it, Cimri… is unlucky.\n\nShe is knocked out of a tree by Sound Burst. Then another cultist slits her throat in front of von Kromp. Kromp waits for the cultists to reconvene as one of them burns through the ice wall with Burning Hands. As they reconvene, Kromp hurls a barrel of gunpowder with a burning rag stuffed into it at the cultists, expending the princely gift he was given for succeeding in the previous mission. When the dust clears, the cultists are completely unharmed, and utterly fucking furious.\nKromp books it in the direction of the Whispering Woods, where he begs help from goblins, and from another custom NPC. He survives, and is eventually brought back to the town.\n\nIn Session 3, we go to see Archbaron Fex, where it is revealed that Sandres has Shax living inside him. And by revealed I mean it is revealed to the archbaron. And by revealed to the archbaron, I mean Sandres morphs into Shax and nearly kills von Kromp, until Shel grabs his lifeless body and jumps out of a window.\n\nThen we are given the task to put up three signs, fire the previous sherriff, then arrest the barman and his shitty bard. We put up all three signs and fire the sherriff without any issue. We even talk down the barman with a minute-long incoherent filibuster from Kromp. The phrase “I’m a goblin,” is featured several times, as is “I almost died.”\n\nWe have a party in the bar, along with three new party members. Paprika and Adelina are there. They’re the replacement NPCs. Also there is our kitsune rogue, Komori, who is played by my girlfriend, /u/sparksbet. We all roll to find more alcohol, and Shel, Sandres, and Kromp all roll nat ones. Kromp goes to catch rats in the storeroom with his jezzail, and Shel and Sandres come into the storeroom to get more alcohol just as Kromp’s jezzail explodes. We all nearly died.\n\nSession 4 begins fairly calmly. We’re made into the new sheriffs. Well, Kromp claims the sash, Shel claims the chair. Fairly soon afterwards, Inago (I think) shows up and hands us a letter, showing us that the hospice for old war veterans is behind 300 gold on taxes. Obviously, we go to check it out.\nIt turns out that the Sans and Papyrus based characters were adopted by the woman who runs the hospice, and they live there. The rest of the party agrees to go with the old woman to meet the notary, while Kromp stays behind. Kromp breaks into the basement, steals some gardening tools, then enters the rest of the house. He finds the sisters’ room, cracks the chests, loots their shit, and is halfway through reading a book about timeline weirdness when Lucia appears behind him. Speaking in goblin. Now, von Kromp is Charisma 8. This is attributed to the fact that he struggles to speak Common, but is incredibly fluent in goblin, so his response is first surprise, then angry blustering in goblin.\n\nLucia is not amused or entertained by my shit, and proceeds to slam me against the floor and ceiling until I realise that I am on the verge of death, and decide to stop being a smartass. I spend literally six minutes (Sandres’s player times it) describing my noble goblin heritage, and the geopolitical intricacies of Scraphole Bog, Stinkhole Sump, and Stinking Groundswamp. Lucia begins to tire of my shit once again. I panic, and offer a solution to the timeline problem, in return for not being killed. My solution runs as follows: “do enough weird shit that we find a timeline that leads out of the fracture.”\n\nSo, spurred on by still being alive, Kromp proceeds to lay down his plan.\n\nSpoiler: it fucking sucks.\n\nThe plan is that we fill the streets with coleslaw, Lucia disguises herself as a lizard and dunks townsfolk in the water trough, our party murders Archbaron Fex, and our new powerful fae ally hides the moon.\n\nDid I gloss over the murdering part? I should probably go into detail.\n\n(also, for reference, three cubic metres of coleslaw costs 1050gp to craft)\n\nThe plan requires us to drug the archbaron, gas the servants, rig the belltower to explode, and steal the archbaron’s spellbook and spell component pouch. Also we gave him a replacement spellbook which was a book of pornographic woodcuts.\n\nWhile Komori dumped ten whole marijuanas into the archbaron’s oil lamps, von Kromp rigged the belltower with 50d6 worth of explosives, and created a nightmarish abomination by lashing sky dragon fireworks and barbed arrows together. The other sundry explosives were also fireworks. Kromp loves fireworks. Adelina dumped several laurel logs into the fireplace, because I was once informed that they release foul, acrid, vaguely poisonous smoke.\n\nWe make sure to close the archbaron’s windows as well, because our plan revolves around forcibly hotboxing a powerful wizard.\n\nAn hour later, between our friendly time fae taking the devils on a journey, a journey throughout time (time is changing all the time, it’s time to go to tIME), and the poisonous smoke upsetting the guards and servants, Komori bursts into the now thoroughly baked archbaron’s room and informs him that the traitors are at the top of the bell tower. He smiles happily, gets half dressed, and saunters up to the top of the bell tower (with help). Nogling von Kromp heroically breaks cover and shoots the archbaron in the back with a barbed firework conglomeration. In retaliation, Archbaron Fex, a level twelve wizard, attempts to cast an erotic woodcut. Komori grabs Kromp and jumps out of the window. Shel, at the bottom of the tower, casts Abundant Ammunition to give me my rockets back, and, when we have fallen out of the blast radius (so nearly to the ground) she casts Feather Fall on both of us, and we survive.\n\nI should mention that Kromp was afraid that 50d6 explosion damage would not be enough to kill the archbaron, and had carefully arranged them to scalp the tower. Unfortunately he had rolled too well to do such and so, by the time the cheerfully-coloured stars and explosions had faded, Scarlet Crown simply did not have a belltower any more.\n\nAfter that we tentatively brokered an alliance of practicality with the Glorious Reclamation, but that was peanuts compared to the fuckery I have just described.\n\nTL;DR every problem can be solved with sufficient application of fireworks.",

I remember testing my transdimensional doorway, something that had taken years of my life to perfect, and then darkness. It can only be considered fortuitous that I had been wearing my Environsuit at the time, but that does not immediately change my situation.\n\nThe place I am currently stranded on appears to be some kind of savannah, but the place if frightfully cold. According to the tools I have found, it is -20 degrees Celsius. The ground is a deep, muddy red colour, though plant life is plentiful. The sky has this rather sickly orange hue, it makes me wonder what the air composition is. I best keep my helmet on while outside.\n\nI sit in this rather interesting craft as I write this. I have elected to keep my notes on page for the most part, for the sake of clarity, though notes created with expediency will be created in the most convenient format.\n\nI am in awe of the technology I have been stranded with. It seems so advanced compared to my standard equipment. Whoever the poor soul is that has lost their life in this location, I hope they do not object to me salvaging their technology. It appears that the craft they were in possession of was attacked, though perhaps it might have something to do with the glowing orb that had occupied a pile of debris nearby. It seemed almost sentient, wanting to lead me somewhere. It called itself Atlas, and was otherworldly in composition. I am, however, a man of reason, and despite my desire for guidance in this strange world, I cannot say that something so artificial yet sentient, to inspire awe as if it were a god, I cannot say that such a thing sits well with me.\n\nI spurned it, and waves of resentment and anger washed over me as it vanished. Such aggression from the denial of a stranger? It unnerves me, but I feel I made the right decision.\n\nI have, however, decided on a goal: I shall find my way home.",

        "text": "So my group had just finished a super-intense campaign full of hardcore role playing and battling. The DM, who was tired of the seriousness, encouraged us to make silly characters.\n\nThis dude that the DM had known since childhood and his GF decided to stick with their characters: a level 7 dwarven fighter and a level 5 dwarven cleric that were in a relationship (it got a little uncomfortable sometimes). Two of my friends coincidentally both made Shrek, one Monk and one Paladin. They made up the Ogre Twins. The other three were hardcore TF2 fans and thought it would cool to make a Soldier, Scout, and Pyro (Wizard, Rogue, and Sorcerer respectively).\n\nAnd me? I wanted to use my Level 6 Half-Elf Warlock, but the DM killed him off in the last adventure. So, I made Snidely Whiplash (I'll be amazed if any of you get the reference).\n\nHe was essentially your standard villain from a 70s-90s kids cartoon. He wore all black, with a black top hat and handlebar mustache. He was a rogue with maxed out Dex and Charisma, but he didn't use knives and swords. No, he used bombs. At the start, I sacrificed my starting gear (save for some GP) for loads of dynamite and big, circular bombs. The DM definitely gave me some strange looks, but we moved on.\n\nWe started in a stereotypical tavern. We were all at different tables drinking different drinks. What is Snidely to notice but the fact that the Dwarf Cleric has water rather than alcohol.\n\nHis NE instincts kick in, and he walks over and calls the Cleric a wimp. After a short argument, Snidley eventually does something that insults his god after an argument. The Cleric decides to challenge me to a duel to the death. IRL, the girl was looking at me with a super smug look.\n\nThen I get an idea. I agree to it, and we go outside. But Snidley says \"Wait! How about we shake on a fair fight?\"\n\nThe Cleric says okay and we shake hands. I text the DM a thing and roll Sleight of Hand under the table. I got an 11, but it went up to 21 thanks to expertise and my epic Dexterity.\n\nWe roll initiative. I roll a 7, and she gets a natural 20. She goes first.\n\nGirl:\n\"I charge at the hoodlum, wielding my mace.\"\n\nDM: \"Roll for perception\"\n\nShe rolls a 2. Little did she know, when we shook hands, Snidley stuck a stick of lit dynamite in her sleeve.\n\nDM: \"As Maryn (characters name) is charging, suddenly, there is a small explosion within your cloak!\" \n\nRolls 1d8 for damage. Gets a 7, about one-fourth of her health.\n\nShe rolls a Consitution saving throw. Fails, and she is knocked prone. So what is Snidley to do but drop a huge, 20-pound bomb right on top of her. Hit, 1d6 damage.\n\nDM: \"Now the bomb explodes.\"\n\nI wish you could see her face as the DM rolled 3d10 for damage. It was something around 16 damage, knocking her to low health. She failed yet another Constitution saving throw, and she was knocked prone again. Which means she could do nothing as I dropped another bomb on her that brought her to around -6 health.\n\nSnidley laughed evilly as the BF, who had suddenly heard the explosion and ran outside to stabilize her. She had already rolled a couple death saving throws, and had 2 successes and 2 fails. He was proficient with medicine, but he rolled a 3 and failed anyways.\n\nThe girl rolls the ultimate roll of destiny...\n\n...\n\n\n6\n\nMaryn dies on the outside floor from concussions from two extreme explosions. IRL, she goes completely ape, saying my character is overpowered. Her BF joins in too, saying that she was the group's only healer. After a good 5 minutes of arguing, the DM compromises: the girl got to make a new character with the same stats, but at level 3, and I would have my supply of explosives halved.\n\nIn the game, the BF's fighter starts yelling at me for killing his GF and tries to start a fight with me. The Ogre Twins come over to try and stop the fight. In the uproar, the tavern owner came out and asked who blew up his front yard. I blamed the TF2 guys, starting a massive argument.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, we had our party.\n\nI have more stories involving Snidley, just say if you want to hear them.",

Hope you do!*\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nSo I'm on my first moon, and man this place is brutal.\n\n\nI'm talking an average of 90 degrees Celsius, can't stay outside longer than a few minutes without my thermal shields hitting zero.\n\n\nAnd then there are the storms. Every five minutes or so one blasts across the desolate green rock terrain, temperatures rocket to a searing 300 degrees, and my thermal shield hits zero under half a minute.\n\n\nI love it. I love the challenge of it, the spontaneity.\n\n\nI station my self at a trade centre for some time, chat with a Korvax priest who is thrilled to teach me his language. Between the storms I barter for travellers starships, but no sales are made. It's okay, I'm saving up anyway.\n\n\nI decide to explore the moon a bit, knowing my trusty Domanish will keep me safe from this hellish environment.\n\n\nI fly a distance before spotting a drop pod. I land close by and sprint through molten winds, eager for the exo suit upgrade.\n\n\n17 slots, yes! This might not be huge for some, but it's thrilling for me.\n\n\nBack to Domanish, my thermal protection reboots after keeping me alive in the storm.\n\n\nOff to see what else I can find, off to adventure...\n\n\n*Launch Thruster Offline*\n\n\nMy heart sinks. What? I try again a few more times in sheer stupefication. How did I not check my fuel source, how was I so dumb? Dozens or docile, harmless planets and I've never let myself run low, but now, now *this.*\n\n\nI'm out of plutonium.\n\n\nA storm rages beyond the cockpit. I wait for the weather update, for the all clear, before surrendering myself to the intense heat of this moon.\n\n\nI sprint. The ground is barren, nothing but small rocks offering a sample of iron I don't need. I'm all too aware of the distance I'm putting between myself and my safe haven, my starship, but without fuel it's useless.\n\n\nI come to the edge of a canyon, is that a cave down below? Caves have plutonium. \n\n\nI jump, I hope, I soar. I land lightly among larger iron rocks and glowing trees. Wildly I search. Where was that cave entrance? I spin 360, my mind racing in horror, did my eyes trick me? \n\n\nMy thermal protection hits 50%.\n\n\n*Weather Warning: Incoming Storm*\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nI'm sprinting again, running into a desolate canyon, whipping my head for any sign of a cave, a hideaway, I need to escape the heat.\n\n\nThe winds are thick with dust, they blind me, my thermal shield depletes.\n\n\nI reach a wall of the canyon.\n\n\n*Thermal Protection Offline*\n\n\nAnd the heat bites into me, sinks through my exo suit. It's killing me.\n\n\nBut this will *not* be my grave.\n\n\nWhether it's ingenuity or madness, my fingers close around my grenade launcher. I blast a dent in the canyon wall. I launch again, again, again.\n\n\nI dig a crater 15u deep, a desperate final attempt at life, and, miraculously, inside this nook...\n\n\n*Temperature Stabilizing*\n\n\n26 degrees. Sweet, sweet relief.\n\n\nI rest. In awe I rest. The storm rages on and I watch with pure wonder from my small cave, my impromptu sanctuary.\n\n\nI write this from my refuge as I wait, as I ponder the workings of this universe.\n\n\nThe winds slow.\n\n\n*Weather Update: Storm Clearing*\n\n\nI must push on.",

        "text": "Hello again! Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThis is a continuation of the previous tale '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 8', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4tugd0/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Last time, our valiant misfits unravelled a sinister plot to conquer the world. The mastermind? None other than Pinnacle himself, having created the Zel'tan in a lab in order to create the facade of an Alien Invasion! Having removed the world's greatest heroes from play, Pinnacle could institute himself as the new protector of Earth. Having figured this out, Minato confronted Sarge with predictable results. Saved from execution by Pilot, Minato and his mercenary companion rejoined with Event Horizon. The speedster had barely avoided his doom at the hands of a high-tech weapon and was eager for some revenge. Finding Barghast destroyed by sunlight weaponry, the team was aided by Patterdemalion: A telekinetic imp searching for his brother and master. With enemy reinforcements imminent, the team fled through the sewers. With Lawrence slain by the traitorous soldiers, Pilot used his suit to clear the way before setting it to detonate. The explosion was potent enough to shake even the sewers the group took refuge in. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\n\"Wait, where the hell are we going?\" Event Horizon inquired, bewilderment on his face. The group had stopped a considerable distance away from the basement grating that had released them into the sewers, taking a short break to try and orient themselves. The speedster was a bundle of barely restrained energy, unable to vent any of his excess zest in the usual ways due to the less than hygienic environment. His comrades faired little better; Minato moved to brace himself against a wall before re-thinking his decision with a grimace. Pilot grunted in irritation, hefting the duffel bags once more as they stopped yet again. Patterdemalion flapped quietly next to him, suspended in the air with a pleased grin. The unusual alliance were relatively certain that there were no pursuers down this fetid tunnel, so they felt comfortable taking their time with things.\n\n\"We need to meet up with the Resistance. Pinnacle has significantly more men, better weaponry and a number of super-human allies. On top of that, he's probably the most powerful Augmented on the planet. If he was blind, deaf and dumb then we still couldn't take him in a fight.\" The charismatic anti-villain sighed in frustration, ghostly flames flickering into existence briefly. \"Hence, we have to link up with whatever Resistance fighters are left in order to have a chance.\" Event Horizon shrugged non-noncommittally but Pilot nodded whole-heartedly. The turncoat mercenary nervously readjusted his hold on the bags before speaking. \n\n\"He's not wrong. That island fortress we met at? The big man carved it out with his telekinesis and most of the technology inside was designed by him as well.\" The statement was said so matter-of-factly that Pilot's new friends almost failed to realise exactly what he was saying. When the significance dawned on them, there was a noticeable reaction. \n\n\"He fucking what? Hang on, he made a fucking castle on his own? Hundreds of tonnes of stone, metal and concrete and, and what? He just thought about it really hard and it just fit together?\" Event Horizon began to rant, descending into little more than hysterical bluster, before he was cut off by a a telekinetic slap to the head. Blinking with sudden clarity, the speedster turned to his newest companion with an appreciative nod. \"Thanks Patters. Needed that. Alright, so how do we handle this?\" Minato have him a half-hearted smile and a shrug.\n\n\"No idea. Logic would dictate that there's absolutely nothing we can do to win this fight. We're outnumbered, outgunned and so heavily out-powered that it makes us look like a poodle caged up with a pissed-off Silver-back gorilla.\" Minato sighed forcefully, cracking his neck with a satisfying noise. \"If he pulls it off, the whole goddamn world will be against us. If we somehow manage to thwart this bat-shit plan then we're still going to be looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives.\" Kitsune looked between Event Horizon and Pilot, a dark glint in his eyes. \"I don't know how to stop Pinnacle and I certainly don't know how we're going to get out of this.\" The con-man's smile turned hard and cold, Minato's fury painted across his face in sharp lines. \"What I do know is this: There's no way I'm just going to sit back and let that smug prick take over the world without at least bloodying his perfect fucking face.\" Event Horizon smirked while Pilot scoffed in disgust.\n\n\"Did you just monologue? You just monologued. Is this what it's like being a super-villain? Incredibly cliche moments between the non-stop panic and the occasional victory?\" The speedster laughed openly, clapping a hand on Pilot's shoulder.\n\n\"Yeah, pretty much. Welcome to the club, we'll cannonize your ass later.\" Pilot's head snapped forward from the accompanying slap, his helmet absorbing the majority of the heavy blow. Event Horizon chuckled to himself before turning to Minato. \"Alright then. We get to the Resistance, ram our foot up Pinnacle's ass without dying in the process and then go for a nice quiet barrel of coffee. Sounds like a plan to me.\" The caffeine addict bowed crudely, gesturing to the dark expanse of the filthy tunnel with his staff. \"After you, fearless leader.\" Minato rolled his eyes good-naturedly before slinking forward. \n\nThe con-man barely caught himself as a blurry form hurtled past him with an snarky comment. \"Too slow, catch up!\" The sewers were filled with the echoing laughter of Event Horizon, his passage throwing up clots of unclean matter. Kistune glared into the darkness, releasing a harassed sigh.\n\n\"I genuinely hate him sometimes.\" Patterdemalion giggled maniacally, miniature wings beating lazily as he passed Minato. The con-man remained still for a moment, allowing the remainder of their little procession to pass him, before following the rest of the group. The only sounds in the tunnel were the rhythmic footfalls and flapping of their group. Time passed without comment between them, as the gravity of the situation began to weigh in each of their minds. The utter immensity of the task before them, the scope of challenge required to complete their goal. \n\nKitsune's despondent musing was interrupted by a single, drawn-out squeal of pressurised air being released. He and Pilot stared at in mild shock at the hovering imp, a trail of obscenely viridescent gas pouring from his bony posterior. \"What...Patters, what are you doing?\" The demon turned with a cartoonishly innocent smile, his grin stretched to horrific proportions, and clenched it's infernal kegels. There was a sudden shriek as a cloud of shimmering rainbow mist gushed out and coalesced into the shape of a unicorn.\n\n\"Everyone has been so glum that I thought I should brighten the mood!\" The grotesque goblinoid giggled as the flatulence fog began to warp into other shapes. Pilot turned to look at Minato, his confusion noticeable even under the barrier of his helmet. \n\n\"Tell the flying demon imp to stop farting...Please. It's been a long day and I absolutely cannot deal with this shit right now.\" Whether it was because Kitsune simply felt the same or because he was moved by the note of desperation in his friend's voice, the con-man turned to their most recent acquisition of the weird and wonderful.\n\n\"Patters, I'm sure that we all appreciate the gesture but this tunnel already smells bad enough. Would you mind terribly if we simply push on for now?\" His words carried the tone of a diplomat, full of reassurance and good-will. Demonic agent of the Abyss or not, Patterdemalion recognised a command when it saw one. With a discontent huff and a surprisingly graceful mid-air bow, Patters dispelled his gaseous effluvial exhibition. The bereaved pair of survivors welcomed the returning silence with open arms and continued on their way. Eventually, Event Horizon blurred back to them with a grimace. His costume was smoking lightly. \n\n\"Bad news. They've got lizards hunting us upstairs. Looks like they've got patrols set up at all the nearest manholes, sewer grates and subway stations. Managed to take out a couple before the flames started flying.\" The speedster swatted away a few smouldering embers as he spoke. Minato growled in frustration, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"That's not all. Must have been a dozen birds in the sky, all of them with their own little friendship group of Talons.\" Pilot hissed through his teeth, grip tightening on the cloth straps. \"A few merc teams are over-seeing it all and it looks like they've got some nasty looking weaponry.\" The caffeine addict scowled, spinning his staff furiously; blood splattering the walls.\n\n\"Perhaps I may be of assistance?\" Patters spoke up with a gleam in his eye and a mischievous smile that revealed far too much tooth. The demon floated gently to one of the walls and pressed his tiny talons against it gingerly. A terrible noise filled the air, as if the sewers were screeching in complaint, and the brick simply began to part. Soon enough, there was a hole barely large enough for the group to squeeze through. \"I can simply reseal the portal behind us once we are through.\" Event Horizon immediately threw a hand into the air, his face scrunched up in confusion. \"Yes, to the young man in the spandex?\" \n\n\"Hi, yeah, thanks. When you say portal...\" Patters laughed shrilly, bobbing up and down. \n\n\"As in doorway, threshold or entrance. Nothing...sinister, I assure you.\" Event Horizon shrugged in acceptance before zooming away, heading through the make-shift door to scout ahead. Minato followed hesitantly, shuddering as his shoulders brushed across the edges. Pilot followed soon after and Patters floated lightly behind him. Minato winced as the cesspool screamed once more and the wall resealed behind them. The process was repeated a number of times, with Event Horizon zipping off to scout out the situation above. Eventually, the speedster returned with a large grin.\n\n\"The coast is clear. Looks like we've moved past their cordon, at least for now.\" Exhaustion was beginning to show for all of them now, even for the eternally energetic speedster. \"We can come up just ahead. Opens up into a costume store, which is kind of ironic...I think? Fuck, it's been a long day.\" He laughed tiredly before leading the group to their Promised Land, an innocuous hatch that had already been ripped free from it's mooring. True to his word, Event Horizon led them up and into the basement of a costume shop. Unused mannequins stood scattered across the floor while boxes of parts and spare costumes lay unattended. It was a rather depressing sight for the super-villains, this forgotten store of oddities a strangely appropriate allegory for themselves. Shaking off his maudlin state, Kitsune began to goad the group into moving. \n\n\"Alright, enough gawking. Let's salvage anything that we can use from the area and get the hell out of here.\" There were noises of assent from his fellows as they began to spread out in search of useful loot: Event Horizon sped off upstairs while Pilot and Patterdemalion rooted through the many abandoned crates, subtlety placed to the wayside. Minato himself began to trudge up the stairwell before a sound drew his attention. \n\nHis well-developed sense of paranoia suddenly rearing it's ugly head, the spirit medium began to hunt for the source. He moved quickly, hands tightly around the purloined pistol, and with the jerking motions of someone run ragged. He tossed aside several of the cardboard boxes in a flurry of movement before faltering; the only thing of interest in this corner of the room was a partially melted mannequin. Patters and Pilot looked at him questioningly but Minato brushed their questions aside with an easy shrug when the mannequin spoke.\n\n\"Hello.\" Kitsune leaped backwards in fright, arms wind-milling in a futile effort to catch himself. The mannequin moved robotically, shakily stepping forward from the corner. Pilot dropped his cargo and drew a weapon with practised efficiency. Patters cocked his head in mild interest, though several mannequin limbs arrayed themselves protectively around him. \"Please, do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.\" Raising it's plastic hands in a gesture of good-faith, the being stopped moving forward. \"My name is Boogaloo. I would like to be your friend. Will you be my friend?\" Minato exchanged confused, wide-eyed glances with Pilot before smiling; his characteristic charisma lacking from the expression. \n\n\"Boogaloo? As in the electric?\" With a spasmodic nod, the synthetic form erupted in pure electricity. Boiling liquid plastic splattered the walls with a hiss as the electro-morph crackled before them. Minato was vaguely aware that his jaw was sore, probably from how hard it had snapped open. He rubbed his eyes, hopeful that this was simply the exhaustion and trauma talking but the shimmering creature remained. The con-man could hear Patter's curious rumbling from behind him and conspicuous silence from Pilot. Trying to regain his composure, Minato smiled much more amicably. \"Well, that certainly is a wonderful trick but I'm afraid that you just roasted your...I don't want to presume but is host the correct word?\" The lightning snapped into the form of a smile. \"Host then. While I'm sure that we would all love to be your friend, being made of electricity is somewhat debilitating for our health.\" The smile turned into a frown before the energy hurtled into another mannequin with a faint pop.\n\n\"I do not like to be constrained. Are you sure this is more acceptable?\" While Boogaloo's tone was completely devoid of any emotion, it somehow managed to convey disappointment. There was a rushing of air as Event Horizon returned downstairs, prepared for a fight. Minato gestured for him to wait without looking, his gaze locked on the strange creature.\n\n\"Absolutely. I apologise for the precautions but we've had a very bad day and there are some very bad people currently hunting us. We would hate to make a new friend and then lose him because your real form is too noisy.\" Boogaloo nodded in understanding before cocking it's head, the vacant gaze of a plastic woman now incredibly disconcerting.\n\n\"Bad people? Are they the big green ones? Would you like me to deal with them?\" The question was met with widespread denial. Event Horizon was, as usual, the loudest of the group.\n\n\"Fuck no! Don't draw the assholes here, you silly bastard! We just got away from them, we don't need to pick any more fights until we're ready.\" Had he spoken to Minato or Pilot in the same way, they would have simply shrugged it off; Boogaloo was neither of them. The possessed mannequin drew itself to it's full, meagre height at the confrontational words. There was a tension in the room now, noticeable even by the typically oblivious speedster.\n\n\"Do not presume to command me. I am raw power and I will not be spoken to in this way.\" Event Horizon scoffed, spinning his staff. Ever the diplomat, Kitsune tried to keep the peace.\n\n\"I'm sure that he wasn't trying to command you. My friend here is just concerned about having to deal with the bad people again so soon.\" As reasonable as his statement was, it was clear that Boogaloo was unsatisfied. It was emitting a noise from the mannequin not dissimilar to a car engine idling. Minato frowned and tried a different tactic. \"I mean, it's hard to be friends if we're all dead.\" There was a high-pitched snap in response as Boogaloo regarded him.\n\n\"I would simply bring you back and then we could be friends forever. It would be easier then. Less rudeness as well.\" There was a moment of stunned silence and Boogaloo capitalised on that. \"I believe that would be best. Yes.\" Minato glowered at the entity, trying to immolate it with the power of his unyielding rage. Boogaloo noticed and whined in distress. \"I do not like how you are looking at me. We will be better friends once you are dead.\" \n\n\"Get him.\" The order was cold, devoid of emotion. Minato's team reacted with a violent enthusiasm, exploding into action: Pilot emptied his magazine into the mannequin while Patters bludgeoned it with his telekinesis. Event Horizon grabbed Kitsune and removed him from the firing line before diving into the fray. Boogaloo erupted from the shattered shell with a thunderous howl, his lightning form scorching away at the speedster's durable flesh. He gritted his teeth in pain, sliding back from the force of it. Pilot dropped his firearm and ripped open one of the duffel bags, extracting a large device from within. It took several seconds to activate, the long cylinder whirring to life. The mercenary aimed one end at the cloud of electricity and depressed the trigger. A bolt of sunlight lanced forward, disintegrating part of Boogaloo's scintillating mass. There was an otherworldly screech as the creature tried to retaliate until a solid wall of force slammed in the way.\n\n\"What a wretched creature you are. Even the fires of Hell would reject such a thing as you.\" The revulsion was thick in Patterdemalion's voice as he maintained his telekinetic defence. \"I look forward to consuming whatever counts as your soul.\" Unable to strike at those who had harmed it, Boogaloo retreated from the battle. The electro-form burned a path into the sewers, an enraged scream echoing throughout the subterranean tunnels. \n\nEvent Horizon wasted no time in barricading the entrance, slamming the metal plate back into place while Pilot fused it shut with a mini-welder. The group withdrew to the store above and Patters collapsed the stairwell with his mental might. Event Horizon blurred around, dropping security shutters and closing blinds. They would be shrouded in darkness had Pilot pulled a small lantern Finally secure for a time, everyone allowed themselves to relax. The quartet lounged behind the counter and shared a beer, with Patters giggling manically as he drained the foam away.\n\n\"Man, fuck that guy.\" Kitsune's words were met with a chorus of agreement, treating them as a toast. A few moments passed in silence before Pilot spoke up.\n\n\"Alright. How do we get to the Resistance from here? Because we just sealed up our best pathway there.\" Event Horizon booed and tossed his empty can at his head. The aluminium container bounced ineffectually off of Pilot's helmet with a feeble plink. Minato snorted in amusement before considering what the mercenary had said. \n\n\"How well do you remember the way there?\" Event Horizon lolled his head back and forth with a hum.\n\n\"I'm a little bit lost in the sewers but I should be alright above ground. Want me to go check?\" Kitsune gave him a nod, yawning. The speedster rose awkwardly, wandering over to the front door and unbarring it. Pilot accompanied him and, with a nod from Event Horizon, opened the door. As soon as it was ajar enough for him to slip through, the super-criminal vanished. Pilot shut it quietly afterwards, waiting patiently. \n\nAlmost ten minutes had passed when there was a gentle knock on the door. Pilot, with one hand on a firearm behind the wooden frame, cracked it open. \"It's all good. Pinnacle's fuckers haven't found them yet.\" Event Horizon shoved his way inside, brushing off the entrails of a Zel'tan as he went. \"They've still got your brainwashed lizards with them and even more refugees. If we can move everyone, we might actually have ourselves an army.\" \n\n\"Excellent.\" Kitsune allowed himself the luxury of a satisfied smile. \"Now, how do transport them?\" They looked at each other, contemplating, when Minato began to chuckle. It was a slow build-up that eventually erupted into full-blown maniacal laughter. His seemingly hysterical breakdown drew some slightly concerned looks from his fellows.\n\n\"I think he's finally lost it.\" It was difficult to tell if Event Horizon was worried or amused. Once the cackling had subsided, and Minato remembered how to breath, an explanation was put forward.\n\n\"We need to move hundreds of people and weapons, right?\" They nodded. \"So we either need a fleet of vehicles or a really big one, right?\" Once again, they nodded. \"Then how about we steal one of the goddamn Zel'tan capital ships?\" They nodded out of reflex before double-taking. \"Think about it. We could use the transportation, the weaponry and the cargo space. Where else are we going to find a way to carry so many?\" Minato gesticulated wildly. \"We board one, I control the Zel'tan and then we take the fight to Pinnacle.\" He finished by punching his palm, an excited smirk on his face. His audience was less than enthused, staring back at him blankly, before Event Horizon laughed loudly. He elbowed Pilot with a shit-eating grin.\n\n\"Remember that canonizing I mentioned before? This'll do.\"",

        "text": "The previous part of the adventure can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4to2nq/swnstellar_heroesstarvation_cheap_an_uncivil_war/).\n***\nWe rewind a little back in time as Specialist Daraju calls Col. Johar, the commanding officer of the AAB. He fills her in on the current status of the invasion force, which is taking dramatic losses. He and the few soldiers that have made it to the promenade are ready to blow open the bolthole to enter the temple proper. Dar gives the command after allowing the men to spread out into combat positions. As the engineers set the charge Dar collected all of the dog tags from killed Allied soldiers, eight in total so far. The charge explodes.\n\nIt scatters the Regz hiding inside the temple, some immediately killed by the blast and many dazed and wounded by the concussive blast. Alien blood both slick and vibrant is splashed against the floor and walls, one insectile occupier chittering madly as its legs vanish in the conflagration of fire and shrapnel. Both sides pour laser fire into each-other, and the Regz fight with the tenacity of a primal animal backed into a corner. Dar curses as he realizes his men are being killed and wounded, and orders them to fall back to a better position. He orders one of the engineers onto the mounted gun they had just used to clear the promenade, and turns it open the Regz that filter into the open air, shards of energy ripping through their carapace and innards. The battle lasts not much longer, and when the smoke and ozone clear Dar and one engineer are the only men standing atop the many corpses, both human and insect, strewn across the ancient temple grounds.\n\nReadying himself and reloading his laser rifle, Dar enters into the temple and clutches his light. The atrium area is relatively bare, with only a large Regztem statue sitting in a meditative or perhaps spiritual form. The two humans clear the space, deciding to check the left-most archway first, and find a large sanctuary room covered in time-worn banners and stone pews. Also sitting among the furniture is a box of grenades, which the two comment on. One appears to be missing, but three remain. Dar takes the three and they check the next room, heading into the atrium. He orders the sole engineer, Cpl. Dante, to administer a demolition charge to destroy the statue in an act of vengeance for his dead men.\n\nThe next room appears to be a bedroom for the priests, but set up in a more museum-like approach, with roped off areas and plaques carved with lines in the Regztem script. Dar takes a toxin detector from the countertop within, exits the room. The two exit the bedrooms and are surprised to find two Reg kids from the supply depot before, the ones stealing the crates. They are trying to pull the demo charge from the statue, and Dar moves to stop them.\n\nAs they approach the 'older brother' of the Reg pupas pulls out the final grenade in some sort of desperate defense, though it has no idea how to use it. Dar approaches to talk the kid down, but Dante shoots the child down with a grim face. The grenade is primed and rolls across the floor, deciding to save his companion instead of the child Dar grabs Dante and tosses him into the third room. The explosion rocks the temple, and the two clean themselves off to find that they're standing in some sort of Reg server room. Dar copies over some of the digital files onto his datapad, then used one of his grenades to explode the room. Dante, still grim-faced after his murder of the Reg child, follows behind Dar closely. The child is gone, a mere smear on the floor. Dar orders the charge blown as they exit the atrium. Dante triggers the demo charge, which obliterates the statue with a resounding thud. They're about to leave however, when Dante points out the hole created in the ground. It appears to lead into a cavern of some sort.\n\nThe duo slide down the debris field to find themselves standing in some sort of large Reg hive, eggs planted and gestating all along the walls of the hidden breeding ground, evidently why the Rebels put so much effort into defending this ultimately useless temple. They were breeding a whole new generation of fighters. Dar set the other two grenades he had onto timed detonation, pushing Dante from the hole as they scrambled outside, the fireball incinerating all of the Reg eggs within.\n\nThey stumbled into the smoky air, the sky above now empty of both human and Regztem aircraft. Dar took a breather on a fallen column as Dante patrolled the fallen, taking the time to answer a call from Col. Johar. Without and pretense or greeting she bluntly informed them of the incoming air attack, the Rebels were going to level the mountain in just a few minutes. The time for rest was over as they started sprinting for the freight elevator they had used to get up here just a scant half hour ago. There they found a tired and blooded soldier trying to pry the door open, complaining that it was locked down. Dar tries to piece together the Reg pictographs and lines that make up their written language, but can't hack the door. The three humans decide to take a more direct approach, throwing themselves off the side and tumbling down the mountain in a controlled slide.\n\nAs they near the base of the mountain, the trio are alarmed to find a large force of Rebels waiting with rifles ready, and before they can react hostile lasers fill the air. The soldier is killed in a solid blast, limp body still falling down the hill, and Dar rolled onto Dante to shield him from an expert shot from a Rebel marksman. The pain shooting through his side was intense as another bolt struck Dante's leg, and the men tumbled to a halt at the Rebels' feet, still and unconscious as stick-like hands dragged them to their fate...",

        "text": "A few weeks ago, a major arc with my D&amp;D group finally came to fruition quite beautifully. \n\nI like to give my players real power to influence the world, so I'm used to their upsetting my plans, and the villain frequently has to alter his own because of their actions. This time, however, things went just as I'd designed it.\n\nA small recounting of their escapades may be necessary. In my years of DMing, I have never seen such a calculated lack of guile from a party. They would uncover evidence, then bludgeon it to death as they pursued the mysterious Man in Black. Tannery with a hidden shrine to the Chained God? Torched. Warehouses filled with summoning components? Raided. Oni in the mage college? Dead. \n\nWhen they came across a powerful NPC wizard in a tunnel he shouldn't be in, they launched a grappling ambush on the wizard, gagging him and breaking his fingers before he could work out a single spell. In the struggle, they killed him - a secondary antagonist essential to my plans - while the warlock I had named Expendy in my notes made his escape. \n\nDMing can be hard.\n\nWhere this story starts, however, the party pursued a mage through the Feldam University, the mystical college at the center of town, fighting off nothics who were turning wizards into abominations. The university was floating in the ethereal plane, gently turning high above the city thanks to a fail-safe the magister triggered when the nothics overran his school.\n\nThe mage lead the party through series of magical elevators (say the right passcode and Levitate to the top, or don't and fall) to the highest level of the tallest tower, nicknamed the Lighthouse by students thanks to the massive glowing crystal, ancient and powerful, that floated in the center of the room. The party kept close and burst into the crystal chamber, seeing none other than a quite surprised Man in Black, the villain behind the recent chaos in the city of Feldam, flanked by his two chief lieutenants.\n\nThe bard, of course, immediately cast Hypnotic Pattern, but the mage Counterspelled it easily.\n\nStill staring at the party, the villains began to speak.\n\n\"My Lord, I--\"\n\n\"Failed. I am aware of this.\"\n\nThe party, down to a single spell slot between them, stood still as the Man in Black trapped them in the room with a Wall of Stone.\n\n\"These bastards--\"\n\n\"Do not concern yourself with them. Their deaths are now inevitable.\"\n\n\"As you say.\"\n\nThe party prepared for the worst. They knew the Man in Black was not human as he pretended, but they did not know how powerful he truly was. They watched, and prepared actions.\n\nThe mage, a member of the Cult of Chains, knelt before the head of his order.\n\n\"Do not worry, My Lord. With these fools dispatched, the Chained God shall surely rise.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you something,\" the Man in Black said as his devoted servant gazed at him. The mage had no time to think as a hand plunged into his chest. He looked up to see a man's face change, to see teeth lengthen, eyes brighten, and orange fur grow.\n\n\"Fuck the Chained God,\" the [Rakshasa](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/9/99/Rakshasa.png/revision/latest?cb=20150815080109) growled as he pulled his servant's heart from its cage.\n\nThe Fighter's eyes went wide. The Paladin shat bricks. The Bard shouted, \"I knew it!\"\n\nThe fiend tore into the heart, chewed thoughtfully, and turned to his lietenants. \"We need to clear out of the docks. You know where to meet. It can't come with us, so go ahead and set it free.\"\n\nThe grey-robed duo, each with his eyes sewn shut, bowed and touched the small gems on the clasps of their cloaks before vanishing from sight. One was immediately recognizable to his father, the party fighter.\n\n\"My boy Righton is such a good helper,\" the Rakshasa said.\n\n\"*Your* boy?\" the fighter asked, clenching his glaive.\n\n\"My boy now.\"\n\nNo one else spoke, so the Enemy, now known to them as the Laughing God - spoke more.\n\n\"You have done quite the thorough job at disrupting my organization. It will take some time to rebuild.\"\n\nThe paladin spoke. \"Well, if you had built a better organization, maybe it wouldn't have been so easy.\" He moved slightly closer, positioning himself to strike.\n\nTheir enemy grinned, but they could see his anger.\n\n\"Do you see this crystal?\" The Rakshasa gestured at the six-foot pink shard in the center of the cramped space. \"This artifact controls the resonance of the keep, allowing it to enter and leave the etherium at will.\n\n\"This was the heart of a titan slain in the Dawn War. Dwarves dug it from the mountains that formed over its corpse. Two dozen mages of incredible power worked on it for decades, shaping it, etching runes into its surface, guiding its power. Its control is both immensely powerful and incredibly precise. Truly, if anything in this world can be called precious, it is this.\"\n\nThe Rakshasa ran his hand gently along the crystal, then in a flash drew his black blade and plunged it into the titan heart.\n\n\"This is a corpse world,\" he snarled. \"Filled with maggots. And I will be rid of it.\"\n\nThe crystal exploded, scattering and harming the party as the Rakshasa shrugged it off.\n\nHe teleported away before anyone could land a hit, and the tower spun out of control, its shearing forces splitting apart its masonry as it jumped into the material plane and plunged to the city below. \n\nThe bard cast Featherfall with his last slot, and I played [Green Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJjnbhSTuqQ) as the party watched chunks of masonry rain down upon the city they were trying to protect. Buildings they recognized erupted into fire and gravel, and stones struck friends that were on lower levels. There, the potion shop is gone. Does anyone see Thudrick? Roll perception... no. \n\nAnd as they landed, badly wounded from the crystal's explosion, demoralized from their descent, and exhausted from the entire ordeal, they heard something roar in the distance.",

        "text": "  This was in a Call of Cthulhu game of the mask of Nyarlathotep.\n  \nOur group was in London after defeating some cultists in New York and we were investigating cultist activities in London that our good friend Elias Jackson had been investigating before his murder. The group had gone to Soho to investigate an artist with particularly disturbing paintings with my character getting plastered at his club. My character was an extremely rich Scottish officer that was incredibly snobby and had a bad experience in Soho that involved his most of the officers from his battalion a goat, and that was all he would say of the matter. The only people who knew of the tale other than him were his Batman Jenkins, his brother who was also his lawyer or, either killed in the war. As such he was not going to that damned place.\n\n  Unfortunately the rest of the party was too poor to be allowed to see the paintings. So Inspector Dan O'Dowd (Irish American police officer from New York) sent an Urchin to tell me to come to Soho. After 2 hours one of the other players went and fetched me. When asked to go to Soho the entire club thought it would be a good idea as well so a horde of Scottish officers chanting Soho descended on this mad artists apartment.\n\n  Now chanting paintings we all tried to buy paintings. I engaged into conversation with the artist and kept trying to buy a painting but he kept trying to tell me about other worldly horrors and eventually fainted and became comatose. Naturally I did what any man would do I stared at a painting. Dan, who had been here throughout the mayhem also looked at the painting. Dan did not make his saving throw and had his soul sucked into the painting.\n\n  Bemused at this my character decided he wanted to buy this painting and so after throwing some money at the artist left with it. Upon returning back to his house he was asked by one member of the party, who didn't want anything to do with my lovely house that happened to have weird things going on in it, where Dan was, I slurred back painting and asked Jenkins to hang it up in the Hallway.\n\n  And that was the second and last time my character went to Soho. He was killed shortly afterwards by a furry in the Valley of Derwent (all 3 of my characters in this campaign were played gung ho but none of them died due to my playing of them as gun ho).\n  \n\n ",

The players were trying to scout the ominous and accursed castle, and the wizard decided to Dimension Door into a room he saw, through the window while they were down at the gates of the castle.  He did the math, and after a few minutes of discussion, I ruled that he could do it.  He didn't know, but that was the room that the Tome of Strahd was located in.  I rolled secretly to determine what sort of random encounter, if any, the lone wizard would face...\n\nAs he popped into the room, who was there to greet him, but the First Vampyr himself?  Needless to say, both of them were a bit surprised.  The wizard, however, rolled high enough on his initiative to spot the tome, grab it, and Dimension Door back to his companions, then offer sagely advice to make like a library and book it.  Strahd made a show of following them for a while, before apparently pulling back.\n\nThe heroes managed to get to the village of Barovia and stopped in the Blood on the Vine tavern to regroup and plan.  The wizard happened to look out the window, to see Strahd giving his best wicked grin.  Before the party couldd react, Strahd cast Pyrotechnics on the fireplace, breaking the window and then flying in with a swarm of bats, then laid a few negative level love taps on the party, before flying back into the night, laughing as he went.\n\n/u/Dreadling was the wizard in question.

Group fills me in on what's happened so far; they're members of the Agency, doing secret agent shit like taking down dangerous vampires.\n\nGM tells me I can be a freelance monster hunter. Since I'm on a bunch of painkillers from the surgery, I decide it would be funny to be an insane German guy with a shotgun named Klaus. Basically a stereotypical Nazi, except for the Jew-hating (but he hates werewolves because they killed his family). Other party members are a sniper named John and an androgynous Asian named Fak Yu. \n\nAfter dealing with a bunch of Fey stuff, we're sent to some remote city in Utah to investigate a werewolf problem. There's gonna be a Blood Moon in a few days, so we gotta get that squared away.\n\nTrack down suspected werewolf alpha, tranq him, and take him back to our base (a bunker underneath a Mcdonalds) to find out what he knows. While interrogating him, we find out that the Blood Moon is sooner than we thought, and a shitload of werewolves are massing outside the Mcdonalds.\n\nRelease the alpha back to his people. Most of them disperse, but several stay behind and fight over who's gonna be the new alpha for the Blood Moon. I take advantage of the situation and mount a machine gun on the roof, load a chain of silver bullets into it, and mow all of them down like the beaches of Normandy.\n\nWerewolves are pissed.\n\nLiterally hundreds of werewolves begin attacking our Mcfortress.

        "text": "My friend and I were playing Age of Wonders 3 together, and we thought it was a good idea to download a mod where builders could build any building. At all. Dungeons, Lich towers, you name it, they'll build it (They even built Forgotten Cities. Don't ask how.) So of course, we just wanted to have fun and not care about losing horribly.\n\nSo then we made a fine gentlemen with a pink mustache, known for beating his troops into shape. Literally. This god among men was named Vangarre. You get a free internet cookie if you get the reference.\n\n**TURNS 1-20**\n\nSo simply put, our goals were to make builders, and make buildings, get free insane loot, and then storm the enemies beaches and kill them. Hard. Our first target? Whoever was idiotic enough to show their face. However, right now we just built our armies, and our Lich towers. Mostly Lich towers.\n\nBy turn 30 our general already became next to unstoppable, and we were also researching everything we could get our hands on. But it got better too. We found out we could constantly farm spells if we built Wizard Towers and Ancient Libraries. We learned how to summon dragons 101. As in 101 dragons.\n\nAnd we were also making all of our units maximum level... Things get better.\n\n**TURNS 50-70**\n\nSo then after all of our units (mostly consisting of manticore riders) were max level, we started going on a rampage with our general. The army consisted of General V, 6 manticore riders, 2 dragons and a handful of dire penguins (This was the best thing to come out of our spell farming), and then we came across Definitely Not Evil, someone who was designed to look like Sonic if Sonic was Shadow and looked way more evil, who ironically (Or fittingly depending on how you looked at it) was good.\n\nWe killed her army and overtook her throne city in 10 turns. After more searching around her territory, we found Stalin. Don't ask why he was there, he just kinda was. We killed his first city with 5 armies, the extra army were dragons we summoned while attacking Definitely Not Evil.\n\nAnd as soon as we surrounded his throne city, he surrendered. If he didn't, it would have been a mass killfest. Lastly..\n\n**TURNS 70-96**\n\nWe needed to look for Krenko, the final person on our map. We spent the next 20 or so turns looking for him. The battle, however, was anticlimactic. 6 manticore riders singlehandedly slaughtered both Krenko AND his city. He stood no chance in any sense of the word.\n\nAnd then we won and saw that the AI's power was a third of the size compared to us.\n\nThe man with the pink mustache destroyed the world with 6 manticores.",

He was certain that those of the metallic dragonflight were not predisposed to evil, unlike those that serve Tiamat, the goddess of the chromatic dragons. He knew first-hand the terrors of a red, which destroyed his druidic home of the Tangled Trees. He tried to stop the spell, but it was too late. The corpse lurched up from the ground, dragging itself towards its new master. Erevan glanced upon the symbol etched on the shield of the cleric, an upright black hand, thumb and fingers together. He gasped to himself, “Bane…” He continued aloud, and more specifically to the gold dragonborn, “Bahamut will not be pleased with that abomination! It is a perversion of nature!” Tu’Shan replied with a sneer, “I do not serve him anymore. Praise Bane!” Tu’Shan let out a menacing laugh. The trees rustled as the wind blew, in a bad Romanian accent that seemed only audible to the druid, “Even the noblest of dragons can fall to the whispers of tyranny! Muahahahahah.”\n\n***\n\nAfter the fight with the ghasts at the tar pit, the party decided to take a short rest. *We are at a dead end, again!* Erevan rationalised to himself, *the only way to get an answer, a correct answer, is through them…* He moved slightly away from the party and began to set up his ritual of Divination, kneeling down to prepare the tribute. As the ritual progressed, dark clouds began to gather in the sky, his movements became more frantic, though still seemingly with the grace of an elf. At the ritual’s climax, he gasped for air as his eyes rolled back, revealing the whites of his eyes, and beads of sweat dripped down his face. A rumbling voice emanated from his mouth, rolling across to the party, “One not of nature, one as translucent as her.” With that, the dark clouds dissipated and Erevan fell to the floor, drenched in feverish sweat. “What in Mystra’s name did you just do!” The arcana cleric, Earth, exclaimed as he rushed over to the druid. Erevan smiled weakly and said, “What I had to do. It was the only path to get the correct answer, to the other one who was with Regold…” With that, he let out a strange, crazed cackle, before coughing and laughing normally again. \n\nPerhaps some remaining spores from the Demon Queen of Fungi remained on the druid’s magical mushroom half-plate, invisible to the naked eye, slowly corrupting the druid. Perhaps the mists have addled the druid, the Dark Powers’ influence on the adventurers grows, the longer they continue to linger on the demiplane.",

        "text": "We started a couple weeks ago, with a fairly large group (6-10, depending on who comes). Each session runs for a couple hours (seven to nine). I DM, and hope to be able to tell the tale in a suitably dramatic fashion.\n\nOur party had been hired to escort a cart of rugs to a small town for market day, which was in two weeks. After we delivered the rugs, the game started. As we walked down the road, arms prickling in the cool of twilight, minds unsure, we heard screams echoing from the other side of town.\n\nBored, tired, and aching for something exciting we leapt at the chance for some action. As we passed the fountain in the town square, the Town Crier came out. As he rang the bell, tears streaming down his face, we heard but one word:\n\n\"Drow.\"\n\nWe moved as fast as we could, but even that was not enough. Breaking past the buildings blocking our view, we saw a most gruesome sight.\n\nTownsfolk laid dead, eyes misted over in the hazy white of death. The unlucky few were strapped to a wagon, their hands bound and their mouths gagged. Although we killed the majority of them, one fled, the wagon following.\n\nWe tried to pursue, but could not see where she had gone in the rapidly darkening evening.  \nWe broke, and slept for the night.\n\nCome morning, our Ranger, an Illuskan Human, managed to find the winding trail through which our prey had fled. It took the day and a fight with a vicious, bloodthristy, Dire Hare (designed by the DM after the mini for the monster we were going to fight was missing. A player had a small rabbit mini, and it went from there), but we found where they were stationed. Their numbers seemed vast, and we were ill-prepared to fight at that moment, when they were strong and us so weak from our wounds. We backtracked, leaving once again for sleep in a neighboring town.\n\nA happenstance encounter with the bartender, a retired adventurer known as Grok the Lichslayer, resulted in one of our group receiving an enchanted dagger of great power against those corrupted by necrotic or demonic forces.\n\nOn the third day since our fight with the Drow, we entered the camp, only to find the majority of our quarry dead to the fowl minions of a human man who we later found out was a \"Poultrymancer,\" whatever that is.\n\nThe enemy of my enemy is my enemy's enemy, no more, no less, and so we were cautious. The warlock of our number sent out an illusion to gauge the character of this strange being. Dressing it as a commoner, the illusion asked the Poultrymancer what was going on, only to be insulted and ignored.\n\nAs we watched, and later entered the fight, we noticed that the figure seemed to be healed whenever one of his chickens killed their enemy. Those of living stock were vicious, clawing and pecking, while those of a more... undead variety seemed to drain the health of their victims.\n\nAt the end of the fight, we were warned that, were we not careful not to cross him in the future, we would meet the same end as the Drow whose bodies now embraced the ground.\n\nDespite his vile attitude, he left a note within the main tent of the camp, the contents of which both subtly insulted our intelligence and gave us the general direction of the rest of the Drow.\n\nThe name on the note read Arwin, and the only other identifier we have of him is a complaint by the local bartender.",

        "text": "*\"It was looking to be such a beautiful day,\"* Blue sighed to himself, reloading his shotgun, as a cluster of Super Mutants slowly chipped away at his cover with suppressing gunfire. \"How'd it turn into this shit pile so quickly?\"\n\nHe sighed and thought back. He and Piper were looking for some materials so he could build a doghouse for Dogmeat. They had come across a house he hadn't seen before, so he decided to check it out. Of course it was filled with Raiders. Not that they stood much of a chance against him, a military veteran who was right at home with a reflex-sighted semi-auto rifle. Heads popped like overripe melons, bodies dropped like sandbags, spent bullet casings flew like hyper-active fireflies, and then silence. After scouring every corpse for precious ammo and other gear, Blue and Piper had reached the second floor, where more Raiders awaited, this time joined by a machine turret that gave Blue a harder time than he'd thought, but Piper dispatched it with a few well-placed shots from her trusty sidearm.\n\n\"Guess all those trips to the firing range did me some good, huh Blue?\" she joked with a smile, helping Blue up after the dust cleared.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Blue nodded in agreement. \"I'm surprised at how good a shot you are. I didn't expect a reporter to be such a crack shot.\"\n\n\"Well, a reporter's gotta protect herself,\" Piper retorted, mock-pouting. \"And with the way things are, going out into the Commonwealth unarmed is only slightly more preferable a way to die than wandering into a Yao Guai den wearing a suit made of raw meat.\"\n\n\"Can't argue that,\" Blue agreed.\n\nThey finally reached the top of the building. Piper opened the door to the outside without checking for traps, and stepped into one as soon as the doorknob clicked. Five motion-activated cymbal monkeys turned on and began their shrieking clanging cacophony, alerting a nearby cluster of Super Mutants, who immediately opened fire. Blue grabbed Piper and dove towards cover as the doorway where they stood moments before became riddled with bullet holes.\n\n\"Dammit,\" Blue spat, digging a bullet out from the elbow joint in his leather armor, \"Next time Piper, let me open the door, please!\"\n\n\"Deal,\" came Piper's reply as she reloaded her pistol. \"I'll try to draw some of their fire and head to cover over there...\"--she pointed towards what appeared to be a concrete road divider--\"...so you can take out a few while they're focused on me.\"\n\n\"No, Piper, that's too--\" Blue began to object, but was cut off by Piper's lips meeting his. \"Wish me luck, doll,\" she said as she prepared to run from cover. She poked her head out from behind the broken wall they were using as a shield, fired off a few blind shots, then broke into a run towards the divider.\n\nShe caught three bullets in her leg before she'd even made it halfway to the divider. She went down in a heap, reduced to crawling awkwardly to an overturned picnic table for temporary cover. Blue tossed her a Stimpak, but it fell short and was shot to pieces before she could reach for it.\n\n*\"Fuck, this got real bad real fast,\"* Blue told himself. He was almost out of ammo for his shotgun, and he was down to his last Molotov. He checked his bag to see if there was something, *anything* he could use...and that was when he found it. A single syringe of PsychoJet. Cait had given it to him before he and Piper had left, citing the tried-and-true reasoning of \"Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it\". An idea was quickly taking shape in his head, one that involved him taking the risk of becoming addicted to Psycho again, after having just been detoxed after his last bout of addiction led to him almost killing Preston in a blind rage. Was that something he wanted to give into again? He looked over at Piper, clutching her wounded leg and trying to hide the fear in her eyes.\n\n\"...Fuck it,\" he growled as he jammed the needle into his arm. The effects were almost instant. Time slowed down, and he was able to see things far more clearly; there was a path he could take that would get him right on top of the Super Mutants. Then the rage set in; these fuckers were responsible for hurting Piper, for hurting *his* Piper...their blood would be drying on the floor before the sun set.\n\nWith a roar, he charged out from behind his cover, pulling out his rifle and taking potshots, stopping just long enough to make sure Piper was still alive and giving her a Stimpak before rushing the Super Mutants. A point-blank shot from his Shotgun reduced the first one's head to jelly. The second one pulled out a large plank of wood and tried to take a swing, only to have its arm chopped off by a bladed tire iron, its head following shortly after. The third and fourth ones met their demise at the hands of Blue's final Molotov Cocktail. The fifth one was already on top of Blue when he finally noticed it, but he didn't care. He reared back his arm and drove the tire iron so hard into the Super Mutant's head that the monster's helmet cracked and broke apart like a cheap plate. The Super Mutant fell backward, twitching in its death throes, over the side of the building, right onto a car in the streets below.\n\nBlue ran back to Piper and scooped her up in his arms.\n\n\"PIPER! HURT?!\" he shouted, still under the effects of the Psycho half of the PsychoJet.\n\n\"I'm-I'm fine, Blue,\" Piper reassured him. \"Let's go home.\"",

        "text": "Yesterday's game session turned into the largest clusterfuck I have every had the joy of participating in. It was insane, but in a good way. Also we are using minor homebrew in this.\n\nCharacters:\nZer Rii'scar - Dragonborn fighter, previous general, current chieftess of dragonborns. Extremely racists towards elves. I wield a massive flaming glaive (Lawful Evil)\n\nHidetanner - A wandering Goliath (homebrew stone golem-ish race) whose whole village was destroyed by a Roc. (True Neutral)\n\nFirst we need a little back story and I'll give the heavily abridged version. Five years ago High elves and Dragonborn had gotten into a war. The war ended with nobody happy and many people were still tense. A little bit into playing a high elf showed up and assassinated my Chief and I was chosen to take the leadership role. I said \"if the elves still wanna fight lets fight\" and raised and army to go destroy  their capital and any elf in the way. I succeeded in flattening the city but couldn't kill the Elf Queen because she escaped due Hidetanner deserting and warning her about my army. At this point i was mildly peeved at his betrayal, like mount his skull oh my city gates peeved.\n\nThis session started after a successful demolition of the elf capitol city and a triumphant march home with my army of 40,000 dragonborn. As we come around the forest adjacent to our home city we see smoke rising from a large rubble pile that should be our city... and the elf queen... and Hidetanner... IT. IS. ON!\n\nThey ride out with a white flag and want to 'negotiate peace'. Negotiations go like this. Elf queen: \"Stop, do not fight us!\" Me: \"FUCK YOU ELF BITCH!\" Elf Queen: \"Listen you don't want to do this!\" Me: \"I THINK I WANNA FUCKING DO THIS!\" Elf Queen \"It wasn't us that destroyed your city.\" Me: \"LIES!!!!!!\" Elf Queen: \"I don't want any unnecessary blood shed, please leave.\" Me: \"YOUR BLOOD SHED IS COMPLETELY NECESSARY! PRAY TO YOUR GODS AND HOPE THEY ARE MERCIFUL, BECAUSE I WON'T BE!\" Elf Queen: \"You will regret this!\" Me: *obscene gesture*\n\nOur armies set up, she is in the forest with her troops i'm lined up in the field outside the forest. I order my catapults to fire flaming bundles to flush them out and cut of their escape by burning the back of the forest. The elves begin firing hails of arrows and the queen rides out with 1,000 horsemen. I ride out to meet her with my 250 elite guard. This is when the DM springs plot twist number one. \n\nRight as we begin to collide what feels like an earthquake begins. I look around an see 10,000 stone giants burst out in a pincer movement from the forest towards my army. My army begins charging the giants all hell breaks loose. The rest of the elves emerge from the burning forest and begin charging. \n\nAt this point the Elf queen tries lancing me off my horse and I try decapitating her, we both miss and ride past. Our horsemen begin slaughtering each other and in the chaos I see Hidetanner riding straight for me on a massive war horse. He tries using a chain whip to hit me and I jump off my horse and engage in some good old PvP.\n\nWe fight for a little bit and suddenly plot twists galore. The elves begin attacking the giants because it turns out the elves were being forced to work for the giants or else they would be killed. Then the sound of bird wings and cawing notifies everyone that a race of birdmen have joined the fray from the sky. The DM informed us that they only show up when the balance of the universe is thrown off. I got super excited that my war was causing that big of an impact! The DM looks at me and says, \"Oh , no they don't care about your petty war. They care about this.\" Cue a giant black smoke cloud emerge from the forest and it begins coming directly towards me.\n\nI issue a tactical retreat and begin booking it, to bad this thing can move about 3 times the speed of me. Hidetanner says, \"fuck this I'm out\" and rides in which ever direction he can. As I'm running an enormous giant skeleton hand reaches out and steals my flaming glaive from my hands. As soon as it grabs the glaive it grows to his size. Muscle and skin begin growing across the bones from his hand with the glaive. Turns out this was an ancient giant Hero-god and the glaive was originally his. It was the last thing he needed in his ritual to be revived. The birdmen army begins attacking him and his giant army. I turn around and yell that the glaive is mine and the giant god responds by killing half my royal guard in one swing.\n\nThe birdmen leader walks up to me slaps me in the face and starts bitching me out that I lost the ancient glaive and allowed an ancient evil to awaken. The birdmen army with the combined power of my army and the elves can't defeat him so we all issue a full scale retreat. Only half my army survived and two-thirds of the high elves are alive. We are now hiding out in the mountains with the bidrmen and are waiting to learn how to beat this guy.\n\nTo recap: I awoke an ancient evil god on accident by playing into the hands of an evil giant cult using my hatred of elves against me.

It was rather bitter sweet. I had gone off to breakfast after writing this morning, it having been roughly 7am. Everyone, but Kimaris, was there. It was then made clear that all of us would be receiving training. I won’t lie that I groaned within myself, not knowing quite how they would train me. But it proved to be rather pleasant- excluding the cries I heard from Kimaris.\n\nThe monk I had, Ahmiaus, was kind and firm. He took me to a part of the monastery where various classrooms were, along the way passing the many monks practicing their own martial arts. In a small room that could easily have been used for a study hall, Ahmiaus had me sit down and proceeded to ask me about what skills I had. Like a nervous girl, I smoothed my skirt as my mind quickly sifted through what possible attributes would be noteworthy. I ended up listing everyone that came to mind: I can sing, play music, read, write, dance, know my manners, but when I mentioned I could cook, he stopped me. \n\n“Might you be able to cook up rice porridge?” The monk asked.\n\n“Indeed,” I replied, though I wasn’t familiar with their kitchen and wares. Nevertheless, I was taken there and asked to make the breakfast item. It was in the midst of this, as I was stirring the rice, waiting for the water to boil, that I heard a shrill cry. It was Kimaris’s sobs, more intense than anything I’ve heard from him. Bordel’s voice, Daevri’s too, began to mingle in, which sent my hands to my ears and my knees to my chest. I demanded to know what was happening, in which my companions replied that we were now linked in thought. A mix of annoyance and fear swept through me. Would they be able to *hear* my thoughts? \n\nAhmiaus placed a hand on my shoulder. \"It would seem the link has activated,\" he said with a smile before instructing me on how I could turn it off. It took a bit, but eventually I was able to turn off the link and clear my mind of Kimaris’s agony. Before I could question the monk about what was happening to my friend, the sound of boiling water reminded me that I needed to focus on my cooking.\n\nAs I finished making the porridge (which was no easy feat with the added feathers along my arm and Bubbles offering his advice all along the way), I interrogated Ahmiaus about what has happening to Kimaris. [In short, the monks have a code of conduct they were to uphold and the boy messed up real bad when he and I fought in Bahamut’s home.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4bkn22/dnd_5e_great_bouts_of_change_pt_4/) There wasn’t an option for me to share the burden since I wasn’t bound to such an honor system. The information did little to ease the knot in my stomach.\n\nThen came the questions about how it was my mind was linked to my fellow companions. Obviously, it is another feature of being a primordial, and luckily the link only picks up what is spoken. That was a big relief. I will likely turn the link back on, now that Kimaris’s punishment is through.\n\nAhmiaus approved of the porridge and then took me to a training room that was vacated. It had a nice view of the mountains (which are easy to become mesmerized with). There he handed me a wooden sword. My shoulders drooped, the faerie dragon flying off to perch on a shelf. The monk told me to go strike the wooden dummy that was centered in the room. It had various pegs sticking out of it, as though one might try to climb it.\n\nI positioned myself and held the sword toward the post. Then with a swing of my hand I struck the highest peg. Unexpectedly the wooden stub twisted away from the blow, the bottom peg hitting the back of my foot and knocking me off balance. My butt wasn’t the only thing bruised as I quickly stood up. Avoiding my teacher’s stares, I attempted another strike and got a peg to my side. With my free hand I pushed the wooden stub away and got knocked in the back of the head.\n\nAt this point I looked back at the chuckling monk and demanded to know how to properly spar with the dummy. Ahmiaus came to my aid and took great care, showing me various techniques and ways to defend while attacking. I became so engaged that I had forgotten the whole point of the training: they're conditioning me to fight better. Though the monk said I was a natural, I can only hope that a portion of what I learn will be of use the next time a serious fight arises. \n\nOh! And Ahmiaus said that I’ll be taught in the ways of a Paladin! Part of me feels honored that I would be considered for such a rank. It's prestigious and I can only hope I can rise to the call.\n\nAt noon there was a quick break for lunch. I was given a uniform to wear the next time I came, as well as a copper token of sorts that I’m to keep on me. I went back to my room first to dress. As I came down the hall I could see Daevri looking into Kimaris’s room and as I passed, I noticed a dark figure. I paused mid step, backed up and peered in more closely.\n\n“Who’s that?” I asked the Human.\n\n“Dunno. Just observing what she’s up to.”\n\nI went in and asked if the girl needed help. She turned around and smiled at me. As soon as she did, I remembered her. She was the first Primordial of Space. It was confusing why she was there and so I asked where Kimaris was.\n\n“He’s with father,” came the girl’s reply.\n\n“When will he be back?”\n\n“I don’t know. But I was told to come help in the meantime.”\n\nI gave a shallow nod and backed out of the room, not sure what to think. Kimaris had offended me on more than one occasion, yet part of me felt abandoned that he left without saying good bye. Had the punishment the monks gave him been too much?\n\nOnce dressed in my uniform, I went to get lunch before returning for more training. The outfit is much different than what I’m use to wearing. It’s like being in a richly made pair of pajamas. The vest was loose and the arm holes big enough to put my arms through without catching any feathers. The pants billow out too, similar to what I’ve seen folk wear in the desert like climates.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon consisted of building strength and stamina. I ran, boxed, did push ups, planks, anything Ahmiaus could think of for roughly two hours. I happily flopped onto the mat when he said we were finished for the day. My muscles burned and my brow was dripping with sweat. I don’t think I’ve perspired, or put in such exertion, since the the time I had to help push a wagon that got stuck in a mire. The Monk sat me up and proceeded to massage my arms, legs, back, and neck. It was rather unnerving how touchy he was, but I trusted Ahmiaus as he channeled healing magics into my aching muscles, maneuvering my limbs in bizarre fashion that felt rather pleasant.\n\nMy teacher then gave me a hand up and instructed me to go to the Hall of Judgement. The Founder of the monastery wanted to meet with us in a few minutes, and so with haste Bubbles and I scurried through the hallways and up some stairs until we met up with the others in the court outside the Hall. \n\nSoon we are ushered in through the great doors. As we collected in front of the throne, a dozen other monks standing about, a low gonging sound rung. All the monks, and the little girl, dropped to their knees and bowed their faces to the floor. Daevri then mentioned under his breathe that the Founder is a Lich.\n\nA chill ran up my spine as a pit formed in my stomach. I watched as a skeletal personage approached the throne. It certainly was humanoid and to be fair, looked more alive than the pictures I’ve seen of such fearsome undead. \n\nMy eyes averted as the Lich sat down and made himself comfortable. They looked about at the many monks all bowed. A calm contended with my uncertainty. *Surely monks couldn’t be tricked into following a Lich*, I thought. \n\nThe Lich barely was able to welcome us back, when Bordel drew a sword on him. The Cleric attempted to silence the Founder, but he simply smiled and informed him that he wasn’t our enemy. In fact the monastery was made so us primordials had a place to train. But it mattered not how accommodating the Lich was, Bordel looked set on destroying him.\n\nCautiously I got the Cleric’s attention. “Do you think it wise to cause a fight, especially among them?” I dissuaded, pointing at the bowed monks. Bordel’s face looked conflicted as he took in the others. \n\n“But I’ve sworn my life to always try,” he whispered back. I said nothing more and observed as the Cleric took a knee. It took every ounce of control he had and part of me felt bad that I defended against his convictions.\n\nWith Bordel’s fight pacified, the Lich then finished welcoming us, reminding us that we would be trained to better access our primordial abilities. He briefly mentioned the copper tokens we each were given, saying we’d know when we’ve tapped into our abilities as a primordial once the copper token has taken shape upon our body. And with that, it now depends on us as to how long our training will take (I imagine most of the wait being on when our copper attunes to us). I predict we’ll be here a month.\n\nWhen we were dismisses, I watch Bordel storm off in a huff. Part of me was certain he wasn’t mad at me, but the other part figured I’d best go check on the Cleric to make sure all was well. I knocked on his door, but no answer came. So boldly, I turned the doorknob and announced myself. \n\nBordel gathered up some papers and quickly I stumbled over my words of apology. He brushed it aside, but tagged on that the situation at present with the Lich was conflicting. I agreed that it was certainly less than ideal. Daevri then entered and upon seeing me mentioned that he’d go fetch Zaren because he had something to discuss with us. I looked to Bordel, the two of us shrugging.\n\nOnce the four of us were in the Cleric’s room, the door being closed, the Human got down to business. He’s concerned that something bad is going to happen to us. One, Kimaris no long was here and had been replaced by the little girl. Who’s to say we all weren’t going to be replaced? Two, the monks all follow after a Lich. That certainly is a red flag and ought to be dealt with. That got Bordel’s support; killing the Lich.\n\nI was less than sure of our ability to take on the Lich, let alone we can’t be sure if he really is bad. None of the monks seemed troubled by him. Daevri mentioned how the monk who’s training him seemed fearful, quoting, “‘I would rather deal with your banter than fail and deal with the Lich.’ Do you think that sounds like a good guy? Ijoeni, clearly is afraid of him. It doesn’t sound like he’s all that good if the monks are afraid of his wrath if they fail.”\n\n“True. But then again, my mother is God fearing. She’s afraid of failing Heironious and receiving His disapproval. So perhaps that is what your teacher meant,” I countered. Daevri thought about it a moment before shrugging and continuing on about how we ought to get going. Our main purpose is to find the cups, so why stick around? Once more I piped in, mentioning how I was learning to fight and that I was going to learn the ways of the Paladin. \n\n“Certainly that is beneficial to all of us if I can become better with the sword,” I added. It stung a little as all the men agreed together, but they seemed convinced to stay for my sake. With that, assignments were given: while I focused on training, Bordel was to get close to the Lich (become friends sort of), Zaren was to learn all he can about the establishment of the monastery, and Daevri would look into finding the phylactery that harnessed the life force the Lich fed off of.\n\nThe final matter that Daevri wanted to address was the girl. He wanted to see if she was really on our side or not. And so we all walked a few doors down and peeked into Kimaris’s room. Whoever she was, she had taken it upon herself to paint murals all over the walls. I made our presence known to which the little human spun around and flung her arms up to create a black fire. The magic crept up the walls and she demanded to know what it was we wanted. Daevri went right on in asking her what her intentions were; whether she was with us or against us. Her dark frame leered at him as she spat out an oh too familiar stance about her hate for the Gods and the cycle of things. But she added, “I just want to go home.”\n\n“And where is home?” I asked. A calm overcame the girl and a hint of a smile played across her lips.\n\n“I’ll show you,” she said engulfing us in the black flames. Reflexively I protected my face with my arms and when I dared to peek, I found myself, with the others, standing in the universe. The girl looked about with such wonder and joy that it made me envious. When would I find a home like hers, where I could feel at peace?\n\nThen I heard something. A sound so sweet and familiar. I don’t know why it was, but it registered so warmly like a long lost friend or family who’s returned that I looked about for it. Where was it coming from? \n\nNo one seemed to notice and I asked them if they could hear it. There was a moment that their looks had me wondering if I was crazy, but the little Human perked up and said, “That’s your home!” My eyebrows furrowed as I wondered if she had heard my thoughts. The girl came and took my hand, saying, “This way!” We flew through the stars, I feeling much like a giant as the various specks of light fluttered by.\n\nThe music swelled the closure we got and soon I was face to face with a glowing sphere. The light from it pulsed to the rhythm of the song. An excitement, a yearning, and a joy, greater than anything I have ever felt, radiated through me. It was as though my primordial spirit communed with the place that it knew all too well. I wasn’t sure if my body would withstand the moment in its mortal frame. Still, I reached my hands beneath the orb and scooped my home to my chest. I wanted to keep it with me. I feared I would soon forget once we returned to the mortal realm we came from.\n\nThe little girl gently pulled my hands down and scooped my home into her tiny arms. She then closed her white eyes and focused. I watched as she maneuvered her fingers across the surface and soon the star shrank. I’m surprised I wasn’t more concerned, but it’s like I knew she was preparing it for me. Soon a glass casing covered my home and a silver chain was attached. \n\nThe little Human handed it back to me. As she placed it into my proffered hand, she said, “This is from Kimaris.”\n\nMiss. That is what I feel. I really miss Kimaris. And though I would have rather hugged him, I embraced the girl in his stead. Finally I asked her, “What is your name?” She looked puzzled for a moment before saying, “Destiny.”\n\nWith Destiny at my side, she lead me back to the others. She took the others to various places they desired and in the end, each of us knew that Destiny is very much on our side. Until Kimaris can return, she will remain.\n\nI like her and part of me knows I’ll miss her too when my friend returns. Until then, I have my home strung around my neck and couldn’t be more happier.",

        "text": "Calvin Burns took part in Operation Gatecrasher wearing nothing but an open vest, short-shorts, one spiked pauldron adorned with giant animal teeth, and a boonie hat. For obvious reasons, he quickly realized he was Australian, even though his initial papers had said he was from the U.S. \n\nBurns became a Ranger (Long War Perk Pack) and served with distinction from then on. In particular, thanks to his ability to fire twice in a turn, his commander outfitted him with a repeater, which has a very small chance to Execute enemies in one hit--but mostly his success came from his high level of skill and obvious fearlessness.\n\nA mission came along to investigate the abandoned, secret lab of Dr. Valen. Croc Hunter came along for the ride. If there were beasts to kill, he'd be the first to volunteer. And there were many beasts on this mission--serpent people. The squad waded through the feeble critters, and watched in awe as Central Officer Bradford killed about a dozen of the little fuckers in one turn, running around with his sword like a madman. But the worst was yet to come.\n\nIn the frozen chamber, the Viper King attacked. Half the group was frozen by its frosty spit, and Croc Hunter's faithful friend, Fridge, panicked as additional vipers surrounded the group. Fridge had a frail constitution, you see, a tendency to panic at the drop of a hat. Croc Hunter and others laid into the Viper King with all their might, and soon it opened a rift to try to escape. Fridge snapped out of his panic just in time to lob his magic freezing grenade and stop the king in his tracks. \n\nCroc Hunter took aim, fired. Executed. The King was slain.\n\nOf course, for killing such a formidable foe on his first encounter, Croc Hunter's legend was already assured...but Croc Hunter doesn't rest on his laurels. No. He is a man of ever greater achievement, and his legend had only just begun.\n\nOver the following weeks, Croc Hunter and his friends trained and fought aliens around the world. Fridge survived as well, though he never quite conquered his nerves--but who needs nerves when you have freezing grenades, a suit of armor made out of Viper King, and two flashbangs with a chance to stun? Another notable companion was the healer specialist, Sonar, who usually tagged along in case medical aid was needed.\n\nOne day, while kidnapping an Advent VIP from a city center, the squad caught sight of another alien ruler through a battle scanner. Oh shit. They only had a few turns to reach the evac, and this Berserker Queen stood right in their way. The group paused to consider the approach. Croc Hunter went on overwatch at the front line. The Berserker Queen wandered close enough to spot the group and immediately charged. Croc Hunter didn't quaver. He took aim and fired. Executed. \n\nNow, some of the team were beginning to feel a little underwhelmed by those alien rulers. It was a long time before they had to think about them again. The avatar project threatened to reach completion, the group was rushing to raid black sites with days to spare. Eventually a tense equilibrium was reached. XCOM was biding its time, opening up connections to reach distant Black sites, and trying to earn enough cash to finally upgrade the troops armor. \n\nA supply drop came in, this was it! They'd finally have some cash. But just as they flew to collect it, a mission alarm sounded. It was a chance to hit an Advent supply line. More money! They'd be sure to get their plate armor now! They suited up. It would be a routine run, no time limit, easy-peasy...and it seemed they were right for the first part of the mission. Sonar earned another promotion, Fridge made excellent use of Sting grenades to keep the enemies disoriented or stunned. Croc Hunter barely did anything, instead allowing his lower ranked comrades to earn some kills.\n\nUntil Sonar took a step forward and the Archon King appeared. Croc Hunter was far away, on the other side of a train. Sonar took aim and Ruptured the enemy with her special skill learned from the Advance Warfare Center. The beast would be more vulnerable to the squad's follow-up. In response, it swooped in and lifted her into the sky. Big Sleep, the sniper, shot it to release her, but that only made it angry. Fridge was too far from the action to land a freezing grenade, so he ran in, hoping he would get a chance...but instead the monster flew into the sky to drop missiles on everyone. The other grenadier, nicknamed Nova,  was knocked unconscious. Fridge caught on fire.\n\nSonar healed Fridge, but he still had no chance to freeze the beast—it wouldn't stay on the ground! She also woke up Nova. The archon responded to all of this by swooping Big Sleep into sky. Nova only had a 30% chance to save the sniper, and failed. The archon slammed him into the floor, knocking him unconscious. \n\nFridge finally managed to hit the beast with a freezing grenade where it stood up on the cliff. Finally, some control, he thought. But the archon was frozen for just one turn..one single action...Croc Hunter finally arrived to the fight, as Nova lit the beast with an incendiary grenade. \n\nThe archon flew up again into the sky. The squadie gunner had to flee, doomed to die if she remained. Missiles rained down again. Fridge was knocked unconscious. The squadie gunner panicked.  Nova was stunned. Croc took the blast and kept his feet. \n\nNow only Sonar and Croc Hunter were up, and the group had barely hurt the thing. The outlook was grim. The archon descended and flew right up into Croc Hunter's face, preparing to grab him. Sonar was too far away, her chances of hitting it to rescue him would be slim; but if he ran, it would easily catch him.\n\nAs if running was even an option. Calvin Burns had spent the entire fight on the other side of a train. He had finally arrived, he wasn't about to flee.\n\nHe took the shot, point blank.\n\nExecuted.\n\nIn 14 missions, [Calvin \"Croc Hunter\" Burns](http://i.imgur.com/tlNoP3W.jpg) has scored 9 executions with no better than an advanced repeater. Three of them have landed on alien rulers, and all in the very first time Xcom encountered them. He is a god. The aliens will no doubt vacate Earth immediately when they learn what's coming.\n\nAlso, enjoy this picture of his pal, [Fridge, and his fantastic strength of will](http://i.imgur.com/tLe5oP4.jpg).\n",

That's a story for another time), had chased after the cultists to the city sewers. Faced with a number of paths, the party decided to split up. With Redforge (the dwarven Paladin/Ranger), Norito (the human Bard), and Theoboras (elven Ranger) deciding to go together one way and the rest of the party the other. While exploring, the party (or just these three) manage to beat the location of a secret door out of some cultists that attempted to stop them. \n\nUpon finding and opening this secret door, the party descend the flight of stairs it conceals, finding themselves in a tunnel. They see a straight path, nicely lit by torches on walls, each home to a purple flame. The party follows this path, cautiously and slowly, only to find themselves back at the staircase they descended. Confused, they try many things. Leaving one of them behind as other runs to the end of the tunnel. They even try to leave a trail of breadcrumbs. Each time however, they end up back where they started, unable to understand what’s going on.\n\nTrying to come up with a solution,  Redforge looks at the torches with purple flame and says, \"I think this might be it\". He moves over to the torch, noticing how it gives off no heat and adds, \"I think... I think one of the torches is connected to some kind of a contraption to open a secret door\" (I am sure that was the secret of the path -chuckles-). When the first torch does nothing, the party move on to the rest of the torches. Pushing, pulling, and twisting until they break. Frustrated they gather all the torches together and douse them with  water till the flames go out. What happens after that? well I am sure you've already guessed it.\n",

Even Bordel seems to have succumbed to the pressure.\n\nThe other night, after traveling all day, and I being very sleep deprived, woke in the middle of the night to the Cleric muttering to himself about something. I think it had to do with demons. I didn’t want to say anything for I was still ashamed from [nearly killing him](http://iadumija.blogspot.com/2016/02/9192997-i-murderer.html), but I did anyways, asking how his throat was doing. He was rather kind to me in his tone, but the topic didn't last long. It turned to the dreams we had from the tea.\n\nBefore the incident between me and my companion, Bordel had drunk some of the tea, the Hermit having sent him away with a flask. Apparently his parents weren’t exactly his parents and it angered him. I sympathized stating that there’s a possibility that I’m the daughter of Remus Trophe, the Lord of my home town.\n\nThe chat had begun to shift back to his neck, I offering to provide more healing in the morning, when a familiar face approached. It was the beggar we saw in Asura. I wondered how he had found us and he mentioned being Bahamut’s scribe. He then looked at Bordel and offered to answer questions he might have, and anyone else’s for that matter.\nI went to wake the others, as the Cleric began to pester the man, Astarea, about what he knew of his parents and what Bahamut wants with him. It sounded as though the Platinum Dragon played a role in who raised Bordel... but exactly what I dare not ask since it clearly is a touchy subject.\n\nWith the Cleric upset, the Scribe turned his attention to me. I refused any answers since I didn’t want to hear second hand whether the vision I had held any truth. It is my intentions that if I ever cross paths with Lord Trophe to ask him myself. No need to learn through the grapevine. \n\nAstarea then had the audacity to ask if I had made up my mind concerning how I would participate in a fight. I flat out told him it was none of his business.\n\nThe Scribe quickly went on, giving the same attention to Zaren, Kimaris, and Daevri. Each chatted with Astarea and seemed ok with the advice given. Before I knew it, the Scribe was bidding us farewell and disappearing as quickly as he appeared.\n\nAll of us, excluding Bordel, barely made mention of catching a few more hours of sleep when the Cleric shouted aloud, demanding that Bahamut answered him. My shock with Bordel was punctuated as a lightning bolt struck where the Cleric was standing. For a moment I truly thought he had been killed for the tone and language used toward the God. He was gone and that set Kimaris off. He threw a tantrum, expressing his hate for who we were and the role the deities played.\n\nI couldn’t handle Kimaris any more. With my own wits at their end, the boy’s talk of destruction pushed me to offer myself up. If he was so mad, so sick of who we were and the order of things, so hurt from my lack of love, then he had my permission to kill me first. I was done. Part of me still feels done.\n\nAlmost as quickly as he had disappeared, Bordel reappeared. Seeing the state Kimaris was in, he quickly silenced the boy by knocking him out and threw him over his shoulders. He then instructed us to get a move on things.\n\nThankfully we made it to the stepping stone trials that day. We all barely managed to accomplish the task, what with Centaurs detaining us, trials that took us on more spirit journeys, nearly falling to our deaths as we jumped from stone to stone, and for much of the journey up to the monastery everyone fending for themselves. It is a miracle to say we all made it.\n\nAt the top, a Monk greeted us only to state we had one final test; two metallic statues came to life to fight us. Bordel sent one through the stone slab we stood upon and got sucked in himself. Daevri then teleported the Cleric to safety. I endured the scrutiny of Zaren as I used my spells poorly. It was another reminder of my inadequacy. The most damage I did was hauling a large stone into the Shifter’s gust of wind, but that won me a spear in the side.\n\nThrough the pain I focused on using the little magical energies I had left to heal my party. Keeping them alive ensured that the statue was destroyed. And soon we were taken in; battered, bruised, and defeated. Thankfully they were hospitable. Perhaps all who venture to the Monastery are expected to be in such a state of broken spirits.\n\nWe were shown around, taken to our rooms, and informed of the meal hours. All of us went and ate first, before I retired to lay down on my cot. My side continued to ache and I very much wanted to sleep it all off. Eventually Bordel knocked on my door asking to borrow some pen and paper. It was there that I realized my journal was missing. It had just occurred to me that the book Daevri mentioned at dinner was my journal!\nZaren came into the room as I swung around to go fetch my book. He handed out the leather bound papers toward me saying he figured I might have wanted it back.\n\nI asked Borel if he needed help with his letter, since he had mentioned not knowing how to write. He declined and I didn’t push it further. One, it wasn’t my business as to what he was going to do with the pen and papers. Second, some Monks came in to tend to my wounds. Once that was finished, I fell into a deep sleep, waking to the gong that has signaled the start of a new day. I can only hope whatever it was that Kimaris was summoned for will give us enough time to collect ourselves so we can pursue the other cups with more vigor.\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻ ",

        "text": "In our group's Star Wars game, I chose to make Dantooine my character's homeworld. I figured being from a backwater world that's out of the way would be fun, and decided to give my character sort of a lovable scrappy redneck quality. Recently, I turned my remote agricultural homeworld into a rallying symbol for the Rebel Alliance. \n\nOur campaign started about a year before A New Hope. 5 years earlier, the Empire began to occupy Dantooine and drafted all the able-bodied young people, including my character. He then spent the next few years trying to get back to Dantooine and free his world. \n\nA year into our campaign, the party gained enough resources to make it back to Dantooine. Unfortunately, this was around the same time where the Imperials were searching for a Rebel base that Princess Leia said was there. \n\nA few years later, the party joined the Rebellion and found themselves on Hoth. After sustaining heavy losses in the battle, the Rebels were beginning to lose support. They were in need of some quick PR by way of an easy victory. Having received some intel I paid a few Bothans to get for me a few months back, I suggested that we send a team to liberate Dantooine. It would have been easy enough. All we needed to do to liberate the planet was to free the single town where a couple thousand people lived.\n\nThe Rebel commanders sent us down to Dantooine. After some sneaking around, and a few heartfelt speeches, we convinced the Dantooinians to take up arms and fight back against the Imperials. With the help of some Rebel commandos we freed the planet and drove out the Empire. \n\nAfter taking back the planet, I did something that earned me a Dark Side Point. To drive home the message that I didn't want any Imperials to ever set foot on Dantooine again, I made a brutal execution video in which I blew the Imperial governor's head off with a slugthrower. I also hung the Dantooinian traitors who were now working for the Empire. In the video, my character issued another call to arms to other backwater worlds in the Outer Rim. If Dantooine could do it, so could they. At least 5 other systems rebelled against Imperial occupation as a result. \n\nSo in the end, I freed my world, but am now known as a terrorist across the galaxy. I'm a little worried now. I made Dantooine a symbol of rebellion in the eyes of the Empire. Dantooine itself is insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but it did create a domino effect in the Outer Rim. \n\nWe won't be moving into the events of Return of the Jedi for a while, but I'm worried that Dantooine might be a potential target for the test firing of the Death Star II. Much like the last planet that was well known for its acts of rebellion against the Empire. \n\nSo basically Dantooine went from being too remote to being a symbol that the Outer Rim can rally around. As you can imagine, there were promotions and medal ceremonies all around for our efforts. On top of all that, my character can now go home when the war is over. ",

The Dire Wolf asks for our aid to reach and free its pack, and we agree to help her out.\n\nAfter a bit of wandering we find our way to the room where the wolves are in cages guarded by a Ebony wolf golem, a wolf with ebony plates fused with its flesh.\n\nEveryone roles Initiative and the Dire wolf who came to help has the highest getting to go first.
