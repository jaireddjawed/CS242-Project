        "text": "As the title say. From all my research in google, an air-conditioning outdoor unit blows hot air to cool the condensing fluid inside. The air should be relatively clean (like outdoor air clean). Can you put the outdoor unit into a room to keep the room warm to dry clothes. The outdoor unit should have a intake air from an air duct from outside so it does not circulate the air inside and potentially over heating. The air duct can have a air filtration that clean the air as it enters. Also the room should have a vents near the bottom so the the cooler air will sink and exit out the bottom. \n\nI have tired drawing it with my terrible paint skills to illustrate my idea [here](https://i.imgur.com/N1MK3iE.png)\n\nHas this been implemented or is this idea a complete failure of a deaign?\n\nI live in a hot and humid country. It rains consistently but it is still hot. Most people in my country has a air-conditioning in their house. Since it is so humid, clothes dont dry. Most people end up using dryers which brun even more electricity. We end up have very bad urban heat island effect. If we can use some of the waste heat to good use, i think it will be good for the environment.",

I understand it, generally. This is the time at which 10% of the parts will have failed, or in other words, 90% reliability. \n\nBut what exactly is the benefit of knowing the time at which 10% of your parts have failed?  Generally speaking, that's a huge number of failures. You surely don't want 10% of your parts to fail within the expected life or duty cycle of the product. What, then, is the point of this metric? What value does knowing the B10 \"life\" of a component have, and how is that used in the way that it's designed? \n\n(Furthermore, if anyone has a quick rundown of how it's *determined*, I'd also love to have a more in-depth look.

I could buy one, but as a welder/fabricator I'd rather take on the challenge of building it. \n\nThe locking mechanism I've settled on is way more complicated than it needs to be, but I enjoy the challenge and think the final product will look nice. I've built half of the [mechanism](https://imgur.com/a/CONksVG) just to see if it will even function without binding. It works pretty well, but the locking bars only move 1/4 inch for 1 1/2 inches of movement on the nut. The safe itself will be 12 inches deep so I can afford a little space for the threaded rod to stick out but would rather not go over 4 inches into the safe interior. Is there a better way to take advantage of the movement of the nut to get the most extension of the locking bars? I'm already considering moving the pivot points a little forward of the nut, but was wondering if anyone knew a little better solution.",

I should add that it seems to me this isn't even so much a a stereotype as it is a genuine belief; some people, they don't necessarily need to be uneducated, genuinely believe mechanical engineering, for example, is about fixing the engine of a car. Why do you think this belief exists when it comes to engineering but not something like physics, for instance? Have any of you experienced something similar?",

He will be framing the vertical portion with 2x4 framing and 3/4\" plywood.  The room has a vaulted ceiling that goes from the wall at 130deg.  He was interested in trying to match that slope with a small 4' extension out from the vertical climbing wall to have a slight \"overhead\" climbing area.  The left side of this 4' wide wall would be fastened to a perpendicular wall to support the side and edge of the overhang.  But on the other side we are interested in seeing if we could weld a aluminum or steel bracket/frame to support the overhang only from the rear wall and not from the ceiling (In the end this is what will most likely happen, so this might be more of an academic question at this point).   \n\nSee This sketch: [https://imgur.com/a/nkV1FM1](https://imgur.com/a/nkV1FM1)\n\nFor fun, since I like welding, I build two 24\"x3\"x0.125\" brackets using a weld to join the sides to create the angle.  I knew this .125\" was way too thin, but that's what I had laying around. I sandwiched and bolted a 4' wood board between the brackets for a test.  Wow, my weight on this easily sheared and crumpled the aluminum. \n\nFun test: [https://imgur.com/a/DAJqkTS](https://imgur.com/a/DAJqkTS)\n\nSo, what would it take, material wise, and structure wise, to build a bracket that would support a load at 130Deg at 4'.  There would be a bracket (or Pair) at each for the vertical studs. Based on this fun experiment, I would now approach this with 2\" steel tube or some larger diameter aluminum tube. But as I said before this might now be more of an academic question.",
