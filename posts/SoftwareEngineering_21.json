For some reason, I may have missed something from the beginning of the design process, and I can't figure out some of the higher level thinking that is going on in these conversations. One day late at work I asked a few colleagues of mine that I felt lost at these talks, and I asked them if they could answer some of the most basic questions that I had. After they explained to me how some of the basic stuff was working, I was finally able to understand the advanced topics that was being discussed.\n\nHowever, I feel comfortable asking these questions to my colleagues, but I am a bit embarrassed to ask these basic questions to my technical lead or a higher level engineer. I was wondering if you guys had any tips for me to overcome this type of anxiety and how should I approach this problem?",

        "text": "I want to start by making it completely transparent about how serious this is to me right now. My current situation is having me consider a career change. I suffer from horrendous anxiety and depression so perhaps it is  blowing my current situation out of proportion. \n\nI have been developing software for going on 9 years now. I don't really count my first job as I was the only developer making applications. I dropped out of college to continue working here and since then I have little by little, worked for bigger and better companies. My second job was at another small software company where I was the second developer. This was remote and I didn't gain much from this. My third company was at a start up with 3 other developers and this is where I really started learning. We got acquired and everyone left or got fired except me. I ended up being remote again for a year and a half. Fast forward to now and I am now part of a 30\\+ engineering team. I started at my current company as the 4th in house developer and the company is skyrocketing. We moved from all working on our own dedicated projects to strict SCRUM principles. Needless to say things are not the same anymore. There are tons of politics but also tons of learning and opportunities to work on cool things.\n\nFour other developers have become team leads with me being next in line for the next round of hiring. This job has propelled my software career by lightyears and for the first time I am confident I can take anything on as I've had the opportunity to see first hand why good architecture, SOLID programming, and scaling is important to high throughput applications. \n\nThe problem is the environment is not stable. One minute people get fired without warning, the next minute we are changing the way we do things. There are tons of arguments all the time and work just stresses me the hell out. I got stuck with the one developer who rules his team with an iron fist. I consistently get asked for input and it immediately gets disregarded and the lead ends up doing what he wanted to do anyway. Needless to say, from going to owning my own projects to enacting the pod lead's will, I have lost my passion to work here. \n\nUp until now my career dreams involved becoming a team lead, maybe an architect or VP. Now I find myself thinking, if I need to move up in my career, I need to get experience with bigger companies and if this is how my company is now, there is no way I could handle something else. I recently got the chance to lead my pod for a month as our lead went to away for a month. We were even more productive than we are with him. Our feature releases went so smooth and the team worked like a harmonious unit. I took the approach as being a guide, not a leader. Everyone got to work on what they wanted to and we all stepped in for eachother when we needed eachother. It was great. So I know for sure I would like to lead.\n\nIn light of crypto I have recently started learning about the stock market and have taken up a passion for day trading. I'm 90&amp;#37; sure I want to switch to this career as it would allow me minimal work hours, working on my own, and freedom. I understand it's high risk, I've read about 4 books now and practice regularly with paper trading software. I'm actually doing quite good so it's not a fool's dream.\n\nWhat I would like from Reddit is, some insight into how other big teams work together. Maybe teams from bigger companies that aren't rapidly expanding. Or insight in regards to someone who may have worked in a great company but then took a step back and worked at a smaller company and possibly stepped down from a leadership role. ",

I am decent at coding in Java and I know some C# but I wouldn't consider myself a great programmer. How hard is it to get a good job or foot in the door to be a software engineer, without any experience? Thanks",

I had a couple of interviews but never got called back. If someone can give me a few hints on what to work on, as a recent grad with no job experience, in order to land that first job and to feel like I'm moving forward while unemployed, it would be really appreciated.

I'm wondering what books you would recommend. \n\nThis person will be working on web applications. These web applications are primarily ASP.NET MVC web applications, but there is one web service application written with ASP.NET MVC Core 2.0.\n\nThe intern will be with the company for roughly 3 months. After they leave, the books will stay with the company and possibly (hopefully) be used to teach C# to people with multiple (10, 15, 20+) years of experience in Java and various other languages. We are going to terminate a contract with a third-party company and will be needing to rewrite (most likely in C#) an entire web application (that still uses JSPs), so these books will be used by other member of my team.\n\nThe book I primarily used to learn C# was written in 2005 (I read it 3 years ago, so it was dated then) and I'm not too sure what has come out since then that would be good. \n\nI do know Jon Skeet has published a couple C# in Depth books, but I'm not sure if those would be good for an intern with no C# experience, however, they may be good for the other people (and me).",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm reaching the end of my computer science degree \\(I literally have a test tomorrow in advanced algorithms that will decide whether I graduate this semester\\) and I was wondering where I'll actually be able to apply the more advanced concepts that I've been taught. I've just signed an offer to a place near my home so I can save money for a while, and I'm writing a lot of full stack web development. Making apps/web apps is fun and I enjoy creating interfaces that people actually interact with and that solve real problems, but I don't find myself ever worrying about the types of problems I've been taught to solve throughout my degree \\(apart from just understanding networking, debugging, and how to write clean code\\). I really don't want this information that I busted my butt to learn to rot in my head.\n\nWhere can I go/what types of work can I do where I'll be working on things that require dynamic programming or creating solutions to NP\\-Hard problems that I can prove will work to some type of approximate ratio? Are these problems only found in contrived academic research? Or do I need to be at companies like the Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. to find problems that actually require this type of work?",
