        "text": "Hello,\n\nI have been massively over-thinking this, and need some outside perspectives please. I will try to be concise but please feel free to ask questions in the comments. \n\nI finished my PhD in art history at \\[top UK university\\] in 2017 and spent the subsequent 9 months on maternity leave. I really enjoyed my PhD and want to stay in academia. I have a solid postdoc project idea, and a book contract to publish my thesis with a respected university press (and other articles/awards etc). I am also luckily financially stable.\n\nBefore I started my PhD, I was quite keen on museum work and have done a few curatorial internships. I am less keen on it now for a number of reasons:\n\n* Being restricted by the museum collection and not being able to pursue my own research. I'm not knocking research done by curators - a lot of fantastic stuff comes from museums obviously.\n* My field is small and I've heard from former employees that a number of relevant museum departments have very hostile work cultures whereas (in my field) university departments tend to be quite friendly. \n* The idea of doing public events and dealing with high-level stakeholders is terrifying (I can handle conference papers but glad-handing does not come naturally).\n* Colleagues have said that it's difficult to switch between museum jobs and academia (maybe this is subfield-specific).\n\nI've been asked to apply for a couple of curator jobs (obviously not the same thing as being **offered** a job!) This is of course very flattering but I'm very hesitant for the above reasons. I'm sure there a lot of people who will say 'don't be stupid, just apply anyway, what do you have to lose' which I totally understand. However, the applications process is incredibly time- and energy-consuming especially if combining that with numerous postdoc apps which are pretty intense (as well all my other work plus taking care of my baby). And, it's just a waste of everyone's time if I'm not really keen on the job, right?\n\nWhat I'm struggling with is that I feel like I don't have the 'right' to eschew applying for these opportunities, given the horrendous state of the job market. At the same time, I know that I'm a strong candidate for a postdoc and want to hold out for what I really want. This is going to sound ridiculous but I guess I want 'permission' from internet strangers to just focus on postdocs and ignore museum opportunities. I keep second-guessing myself and it's exhausting as I'm normally a very decisive person! \n\nThank you for reading if you got this far. Please be nice, I'm trying my best.",

My work is theoretical and computational, thus I work on my computer most days--coding, reading, writing.\n\n**The situation:** To make a long story short, my girlfriend and I have been dating for many years now--mostly long distance (we met in undergrad but have since had to relocate several times separately for work and education). After a lot of discussion and hard decision making, we determined that she cannot relocate to where I am on the east coast for personal reasons. Thus, we are seriously considering the option of me moving out to one of the large cities in Texas, where she currently lives and works, starting at the beginning of my 4th year. I'm pretty comfortable accessing university networks and computing clusters remotely, so I feel good on that resource end. The plan would be to work remotely and visit campus every 1-2 months. My advisor advised against moving away, of course, but said she understood that happiness is important and would do her best to make it work should I end up moving away.\n\n**My ask**: *Does anyone have experience with finishing a PhD remotely in the last years of their program?* Any insights welcome.",

They have already given informal approval to continue the work.\n\nHowever, my results are not as expected and requires a lot of in depth research and concepts that I feel are probably (definitely) above my head. In our most recent individual meeting, my PI also says this will require him communicating with a previous colleague who he had a written a paper with (that my research is an offshoot of). I asked if I could just update him weekly on my progress (whatever that may be, reading papers, debugging code, etc.) and he seemed somewhat receptive to that, but he also said that he \"apologizes in advance\" because the semester gets crazy for him and he doesn't know how responsive he can be.\n\nI am aware that my project is low on his priority list as an undergraduate, especially from an external university. But I'm wondering if it is worth it to still be assertive about wanting to be involved with this project or if I should call it quits and find something to work on with my previous PI at my home university?

I applied for M.S./PhD with the intent to do a PhD, but I'll get to that later.\n\nI'm just going to toss some backstory here for context. I've spent the past three summers and part time during the school year in my undergrad working for national laboratories, which is where my interest in graduate school has come from. I like doing research, but sometimes it's not social enough for me and working in things like project management or infrastructure operations or supply chain still heavily interest me.\n\nAfter talking with some people already, I've learned that getting a PhD isn't necessary for national lab work either - but the idea of digging into a research field still has heavy appeal to me. So my plan that I was thinking about was trying to do an internship during the summer of my masters program (next summer) and then from there deciding whether or not to commit to the masters program.\n\nThe question arises is how to go about finding an advisor - there is still a heavy chance I would want to continue with the PhD, but I know that advisors are more keen towards PhDs versus masters students funding wise. (I was guaranteed funding for 5 years but I know that's assuming an advisor wishes to fund you) Also, from what I can tell it's preferred if you don't do graduate internships and instead stay at the university doing your research, but I really want to get my feet wet outside of national laboratory research work.\n\nSo, I don't really have a specific question, but if anyone has wisdom or advice that applies to this situation that'd be great. I'm pretty flexible when it comes to research area as a lot of things interest me at least so hopefully that won't add to a challenge in finding an advisor.\n\n**tl;dr Admitted and got fellowship to MS/PhD program, not 100% sure about PhD aspect though and want to do internship in first summer to experience life outside national labs/universities, how do I go about finding an advisor with this in mind? Is there a better way to go about the MS portion of graduate school?**",

All my data is collected, some of it is processed, and my thesis is about 1/4 written. I also have 2 incompletes to finish (due to this ongoing issue with anxiety and depression) and I do have more than half of both courses finished. The rest of my coursework is done. If I were a perfect healthy individual who was 100% willing to get to work and finish, I could probably defend at the end of September.\n\nHowever, I haven't done any work at all for two months. I've been extremely avoiding it. Every time I get close to working, I get so anxious about doing it that I walk away. I fear failure, and letting down my advisor. I feel like all my interest in my project has washed away. I have fantasies about quitting my MS and abandoning my field altogether to work in something completely different. The main reasons for me not wanting to quit are that I fear that it will kill my career before it starts, and I would be so ashamed and embarrassed. I also feel guilty because I'm being paid off a grant, and if I quit, I don't know what that will mean for my advisor and the timing/requirements of the grant.\n\nI have struggled with mental health issues all my life, so that is nothing new. It's hard to tell how much of my disinterest/lack of enthusiasm about my project is because of my mental issues, or if it is truly because I don't like it anymore. I'm not even sure how much that matters? I feel so stupid, like I am so close to being done, why can't I just finish? It seems totally ridiculous to think about quitting now. But my work is only creating anxiety and feelings of revulsion in me right now. When I started my MS, I was really happy. I felt challenged and fulfilled and loved my work and classes and was really driven to do well. That slowly turned to \"I just want to get this piece of paper\" and now I don't even know if I want to do that. I feel like I *should*, because I am so close.\n\nI would love to hear any advice you all have, and would be happy to answer any additional questions. Thank you.",

Is this a problem?\n\nWhich strategies do you use that go beyond reading the abstract but give you enough information to decide whether to devote 1-2 hours reading the paper in detail?\n\nIf there was a tool that turned your PDFs into  navigable review cards so you expand and contract each section, go straight to the cited sources without looking them up, and that gave you full-size figures, would you use it? Or would you just seek out the publisher's HTML version online (if there is one)?\n\nOr, if you could imagine something that would make it easier to digest the literature, what would it look like?\n\nHope it's OK to ask this here.",

For those not familiar, RAP is a new academic rank between postdoc and assistant professor (or lecturer in the UK). \n\nI try to analyse the pros and cons of the two options:\n\nPostdoc in Oxbridge:\n - prestigious\n - access to international datasets (I'm in public health and this potentially affect the research output) \n - explore and learn in new environments\n - more focused in the research area that I'm interested in\n - higher degree of freedom\n\nRAP in the original lab\n - a step ahead in the academic track\n - more than a double of salary than the postdoc in oxbridge \n - staying with family and SO\n - familiarity with research environment and the requirement of different research funding, etc \n - eligibility for applying research fundings \n\nI don't seem to see which options to be better than the others.

        "text": "I recently read the book [*The Lean PhD*](https://www.macmillanihe.com/page/detail/The-Lean-PhD/?K=9781352002829) and the book mentioned statistics about job placement that I think I have heard before but again make me very insecure about the fact that I'm not a Ph.D. student at an elite institution. See, for example:\n\n&gt; ... prestigious universities matter a lot. Consider that many PhD students are not particularly successful. A 2014 paper in the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* examined the research productivity of 14,300 scholars who received an economics PhD from 154 American and Canadian institutions. ... Unsurprisingly, they found that PhD students from the most renowned institutions can be extremely productive. ... However, they also found that the number of [high quality] papers of the median PhD student at Harvard and MIT is only at 0.2, whereas the top 1 per cent of students at non-prestigious universities manage to produce about as many [high quality] papers as those at Harvard and MIT. ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet it appears that the top researchers from non-prestigious academic institutions are usually not the ones that end up in academic jobs. Indeed, other research indicates that faculty hiring has little to do with performance during the PhD. ... Just 18 elite universities produce half of all computer science professors, 16 schools produce half of all business professors, and eight schools account for half of all history professors. Hence, ... a PhD student will face an uphill battle in securing an academic job ... if they completed the PhD, even if it was an outstanding one, at a second-tier university.\n\nThe author (Julian Kirchherr) even compares academia to a pyramid scheme later in the book.\n\nEven just glancing through journals, I feel insecure when looking at the institutional affiliation of the authors and seeing they're coming from the Harvards and Berkeleys.\n\nI'm at a mathematics department studying mathematical statistics. My advisor has published hundreds of papers, some in top-4 statistics journals. His past students have seen good job outcomes. The department itself was ranked 32 in the nation. My advisor and I are looking at publishing a paper in a good journal; I'm working on final referee-requested revisions right now.\n\nThe fact that I already knew someone with a good reputation at a school I was at, who I clicked with, who's research interests seem to align with mine, lead me to stay at my school. And I heard that the advisor is more important than the institution anyway.\n\nStill, I'm very nervous.\n\nAs Kirchherr suggested, good publications may not be enough. So let's suppose that I was going to be super ambitious and I wanted to set myself up for a tenure track position at UC Berkeley (I was recently there for an MSRI workshop). In addition to buckling down and start writing papers, what else should I consider doing?\n\n* Should I try to go to more conferences and network with people from Berkeley?\n* Should I try to gear publications to align with those already there?\n\nOr in general, is there any way I can overcome the fact that I'm not at MIT?\n\nEDIT: Also, I've taught a class every semester (even summers) since fall 2015, from a minimal stats course to a calculus-based course to R programming labs. And I keep a blog that gets over 500 views a day.",

He sent me papers to read over the course of the month, but also said he wasn't expecting me to finish them all since finals started in mid-May. He also said if I'm in town for the summer I can do research throughout this period.\n\nI told him in May that I can stay for the summer by dorming here and would be happy to continue the research through this time, but my dorm wouldn't open until June 1st. My professor was fine with that and said we could meet starting then.\n\nThe first month or so was rather good; we would meet and discuss papers, he would give me more papers, etc. We even talked about me continuing this research in the Masters program if I applied and got in. However, around June 20th he just disappeared. I emailed the PhD Student under him and he told me the professor was out of the country, but he'd be happy to take questions. I went with him for questions for the rest of June, but he ended up leaving town prior to the start of July. I never heard anything back from the professor until July 16, who asked if we could meet at a certain date/time. I told him that due to my summer job I couldn't meet at that specific time , but I could definitely meet at another date/time.\n\nI never got an email back, and with work and all I was too busy to follow up immediately. But I followed up the next week telling him my dorm stay would be coming to an end in a week and I was hoping we could meet before then or meet once classes resumed. He emailed me back saying he decided to cancel the research because his fall/summer semester is too busy and he doesn't think he can advise new students any more, and encouraged me to reach out to other professors for research.\n\nI'm not sure if he cancelled research for another reason, or if he genuinely realized he doesn't have time for the research with new students. I feel for investing time and money for my summer to do research, for him to cancel without at least providing a reason or giving me some sort of advanced heads-up is really unfair. How should I proceed with this issue? There was another student doing research alongside me, I plan on emailing him to see if the same thing happened to him. I told my parents and they were pretty mad and said I should take this up with the school, but I want to at least clear this up on the ground before I do anything like this. I won't get reimbursed and I effectively wasted my summer (although I did make money through a summer job, so there's that), but should I just let this die or pursue it?",

This is understandable, and I am not opposed to going elsewhere for my graduate work, but as an *adult* student, I am established in my area in the ways the typical undergrad isn't, and so going to another region to do an MS is not a trivial proposition for me.

Unfortunately, you can't exactly explain that in your resume or cover letter, so I haven't disregarded the prospect of the black mark.\n\nThat being said, with data science and AI being fairly emerging fields, I gather that in lieu of a degree in those subjects specifically (which mostly don't exist yet) many do some combo of a technical degree + a degree in statistics.\n\nTo your knowledge, if I went on to do master's work in statistics at the same place as my undergrad in CS, would this help mitigate the strike against me?

Supporting family and my studies while committing 40 hrs/wk seems daunting but I’m up for it.\n\nHow did you go about juggling your other commitments (work, family, other hobbies)? Is it really just losing out on sleep?\n\nAnything you wish you did differently? I’m thinking of stress management or how you prioritized coursework vs research for dissertation, etc.\n\nHow did you go about finding your topic? I have a few floating around (financial aid being linked to “degree applicable” hours impacting perceptions of majors, defining free speech on campus, mentorship or coaching and its effects on resiliency in a limited access or challenging major) but can’t commit to anything just yet.\n\nAnything else I should be mindful of in my pursuits? I don’t really care about job prospects beyond my studies. I like my current position. I’d also like to publish and continue to work in higher ed, and I assume this will help should I ever want to climb the latter.\n\nThanks for any insight or advice!",

        "text": "I  am an Indian literature student. I completed my Masters in English  Literature and have Junior Research Fellowship. I recently joined PhD in  another university in India. Both the universities that I did my  Masters from and where I am pursuing my PhD are public universities,  centrally funded and considered among the top choices in humanities  education as well as in general.\n\nI had  aspired to apply for PhD in one of the renowned universities in US/UK,  but I couldn't prepare my application initially due to some personal  issues, and later decided to apply in India and work on my research  problem, as the application process for PhD is takes a long time and I  needed admission as soon as possible (Switched to literature after  B.Tech and a job of two years, so a little late in years as compared to  average age of researchers in India). Recently, I have been having  conflicting thoughts about my decision. I'll lay out my conflict below:\n\nOne on hand-\n\n* I  like it fairly well here in my university, both in terms of faculty and  students. Generally, humanities education is the most neglected and  dilapidated among different disciplines in India as all the focus is on  professional disciplines and employability.\n* I  am financially secure. I have a central fellowship, tuition and  accommodation fee is minimal, and cost of living is extremely cheap.  There is decent scope for saving. I feel that in US/UK, there'd be no  scope of any savings, and I'd want to have some financial base by the  time I finish my PhD (probably will get married somewhere in between as  well). I also prefer it here as I'm closer to my parents, although  that's not an overriding factor.\n* I  want to stay in India and teach here. I have no intentions of settling  outside, even though humanities education doesn't offer the brightest  careers here.\n\nOn the other hand-\n\n* US/UK  universities dominate in all the rankings and ratings when it comes to  literature. This is all the more relevant, since all literature I'll be  working with is also in English language (native or translated). By all  accounts they are the best that there is. And not just the top 10-20,  but even the universities comprising top 100 outrank Indian universities  heavily(I understand that's mostly because our faculty/student ratio  sucks, but other factors also favor them generally).\n* In  India, foreign education has a glamor which apparently makes your CV  stronger than your Indian counterparts, and makes it easier for you to  apply to and get positions in top universities which would otherwise  demand stellar research CV or networking and clout for Indian  researchers. I said 'apparently' because I have no proof of this, but  this is the general feeling shared among student body.\n* Having  aspired for it once, time and again I feel that I have compromised,  settled for less, and didn't try hard enough, even though I have no real  complaints in my current place. This keeps coming back to haunt my  conscience and my self-conception.\n\nI  have engaged in endless arguments and counter-arguments with myself in  my mind, and now I don't know which voice is true and practical, and  which one is voice of my external influence. Am I rationalizing my  decision to settle for less and stay in India, or am I chasing the  fantasy of foreign education like a star-struck Indian even as my  rational mind rejects it? Does the truth lie somewhere in between?\n\nI  would love to know the opinions of researchers studying in universities  in US/UK, and how their has experience been, in terms of academic  quality, financial burdens of fees and expenses, and career prospects.  How different did you find it from research environment in universities  of other countries? Any Indian scholars who did their PhD in US/UK (in  literature or humanities), I would love to know your opinion and  experience.\n\nThank you for reading this long post patiently.",

        "text": "**How do the people of reddit deal with difficult work relationships in research?** **I’d like to hear from people in academia who have dealt with difficult supervisors and coworkers.**  I've worked in science for many years. I recently started working in a new lab this past spring. It's in a new field of study with a well-respected PI with a huge list of publications and grants. The interview process was very encouraging and we saw eye to eye on some key points that are very important to me. One important point was that I would no longer be involved with lab management, something I’ve done in the past and hated basically because people treat lab managers like idiots/indentured servants. I was so relieved on that point when they told me they already had a lab manager. However, upon starting the position I have been really disappointed in the stark reality of the lab. The lab is in violation of many rules and regulations that are required in research, purposefully violating regulations in terms of storage of hazardous materials, chemical waste, animal protocols, and just plain dirty to the point of finding animal droppings from the animal room that were routinely transferred to and from the facility in a common use equipment box that was stored in the lab.  Yes, I know labs are messy and no, I don't expect a clean environment in a research lab at all times but seriously? We also haven’t been audited by health and safety for many years. I don’t know how that’s happened.\n\nWhen I saw all of this, I sort of just played the idiot with the lab manager saying, “Wow, it really seems you need some help here. Do you want to work together to take care of chemical waste?” While I didn’t want to do that, it worked and things have been better in that area. Basically, if these things don’t get cleaned up it will affect all of us regardless of who made the mess in the first place. It’s amazing the number of people who don’t understand this but let’s get back on track. **Why have I seen so many researchers in my background that know there are important tasks that need to be done yet decide not to do them** **simply because they don’t want to, and why does it seem like an impossible task in research to get people to do their job?**\n\nWith my background, I was really excited to work in this area of research. I saw it as a learning process, giving me the ability to learn new techniques is what I love best in a new field that is a tangent of my previous work.  I was placed with an Associate Professor who I was told to work with and shadow to pick up new techniques that I would use. These new techniques are completely foreign to me, in a separate field that usually involves post graduate work. I’ve worked hard to cultivate these techniques even though it feels out of left field, wasn’t something that was discussed in the interview, and was not part of the job posting. Associate professor does not let me shadow, saying I need to be independent and that everyone needs to optimize these experiments for themselves. Associate professor also doesn’t use a lab notebook and does not value them. When I try to ask general questions I’m told to ask someone else, google the answer, or even watch a video on YouTube to teach myself. He won’t look at the results I produce, leaving me confused on what it all means and what I’m even looking at. He gives me samples that I use as practice, the results look awful but he shrugs it off saying the samples don’t matter anyway. It’s difficult to get even the simplest questions answered**. Why is this acceptable behavior in research, while anywhere else asking for training is an important part of any job?**\n\nThen I have a two month performance review with the head PI, which is great. He couldn’t have given a more glowing review. I discussed my problems with Mr. Associate Professor and long story short I was asked to work with the lab manager more in terms of technical help. The lab manager has decades of experience performing these techniques and in general she is very helpful about answering questions. I don’t fault her in anything that happened.\n\nAfter the review, I was filled with determination. I made it through my PhD and gosh darn it I felt I could make it through this.  Every week I discussed all my problems in lab meeting, making powerpoint slides with images and bullet points and everything. Communication is key, right? I discussed technical issues with other researchers in my lab and even with Mr. Associate Professor in a face to face conversation. I researched my ass off in this field, reading as much as I could and I got better over a three month period. The samples looked so much better in fact, he gave me some of his own precious samples asking me to process, analyze, and image them for him. This was on a Monday and I was set to take some time off later on in the week. I jump into it, getting the samples done before I leave. They looked great in my opinion, and I hand them off to him the next day. He comes back saying I need to repeat everything because I didn’t use the correct slides. (Horrified silence) Me: “I’m confused. I discussed the slide issue in the lab meeting several times. I discussed it with you in a face to face meeting. I discussed ordering different slides with the lab manager.” Mr. Associate Professor: “You didn’t discuss it with me.” (Angry, horrified silence).\n\n**Okay, so apparently no one fracking pays attention during the fracking lab meeting.** Apparently, more than one person in the lab knew that they lab already had specific slides for this experiment yet for some reason me discussing the issue in lab meeting and in face to face discussions made no difference. The lab manager knew we had these slides. I became really upset and just in anguish asked why didn’t you say anything this whole time? He says he had no idea I changed slides and that I need to repeat everything. At this point it’s important to mention that we use shared equipment, and that I had already discussed with the equipment manager when I could perform these experiments and was told I would only have that one day that week to do it which is why I jumped on it ASAP. I tell Mr. Associate Professor that I can’t repeat the experiments because the machine isn’t available and that since I’ll be gone I won’t be able to do it that week. He rails some more about how I didn’t inform him. At this point, I’ve had enough and I say I think its best you work on processing these samples yourself from now on. He’s pretty furious with me, saying we need to discuss it with the head PI. I agree that it’s time. He disappears from the lab. I wrap everything up for the day, sitting there trying to figure out what to do. I talk with the head PI about what happened, discussing how upset I was and my reaction to his request. He seemed to blow it off as a simple miscommunication. The next day was my last day before taking some time off. I don’t know what happened but there was a meeting between the lab manager, the head PI and Mr. Associate Professor. I chatted briefly with the head PI about some other work but that was it. And then I left for some time off. \n\n**Situations like this are so incredibly common and it’s not even relegated only to research.** **Working in academia can be so incredibly frustrating.** **People are condescending, rude, selfish, and create an environment I don’t necessarily want to work in.** **I’d like to hear from anyone who went through something similar and how you dealt with the situation.** \n\nTL;DR: Why can’t I work with responsible scientists? Is that too much to ask?",

It didn't use to be like that, up until today.\n\nI'm using Mendeley 1.19.1, Windows 10 Professional 1803, and Microsoft Word 2010 version 14.0.4734.1000 (32-bit).\n\nThanks!\n\n**EDIT:** I've narrowed it down specifically to making adjustments in the online style editor, to the font for the inline citations, eg. clicking \"underline\" and saving the style, makes the code appear. Simply copying an existing style, making another modification (eg. to \"et al\" usage) and saving it, works no problem for in text citations. Maybe an issue with how the on-line editor translates me clicking the \"underline\" button into actual code?\n\n**EDIT2:** I've tried manually changing the code by adding \"text-decoration: underline\" to the relevant field, but unfortunately the bug persists when using this altered CSL code as a style in Mendeley. Sigh.",

        "text": "Hi AskAcademia,\n\nI would like to begin by letting you know that this is a long post and the tl;dr is at the bottom :)\n\nI am a second year Chemical Engineering (ChemEng) student this fall and I am asking for your opinions and advice on what my second major should be - either Chemistry (Chem) or Computer Science (CS) and the choice that is not picked may become my minor. As of now, I have plans to pursue a PhD in ChemEng in either the energy or polymer field. The reason why I am looking to pursue Chem as a double major is because my school's ChemEng program does not require too much Chem courses such as PChem, Inorg, or Analytical Chem and I think it is very useful in the field that I am looking to do (Plus, I enjoy doing Chemistry!). On the other hand, I also really enjoy coding (still a beginner though...) and it seems to be a powerful skill to have in research, at least I have the preconceived notion that it does. In addition to that, I am actually intrigued in machine learning and computer security. It'd be interesting subjects to learn! The list of core courses that I have to take for the individual majors are in the tables below:\n\n|Chemical Engineering|Chemistry|Computer Science|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Thermodynamics I, II|Physical Chemistry I, II|Data Structures|\n|Material &amp; Energy Balance|Physical Chemistry Lab I, II|Systems Fundamentals I, II|\n|Numerical Methods|Organic Chemistry I, II|Theory of Computation|\n|Fluid Dynamics|Organic Chemistry Lab I, II|Computer Networks|\n|Heat &amp; Mass Transfer|Inorganic Chemistry I|Fundamentals of Software Development|\n|Reaction Engineering &amp; Chemical Kinetics|Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy Lab|Analysis of Algorithms|\n|Process Engineering Design I, II|Research in Chemistry (2 Semesters)|Software Engineering|\n|Molecular Modeling|(2 Specialization Courses)|Research in Computer Science (2 Semesters)|\n|Organic Chemistry I||(3 Specialization Courses)|\n|Cellular Biology|||\n|(2 Specialization Courses)|||\n\nIf I were to double major in CS, I am pretty much done with the Chem minor by the end of this Fall. Whereas if I were to minor in CS, I would have to take more CS courses until the end of my junior year. The courses I have taken so far are: \n\nMath: Calc I, II, III\n\nChem: Gen Chem I, II. Orgo I\n\nCom Sci: MATLAB, Intro to Oriented Programming (Java), Data Structures\n\nResearch: Polymer Science for 1 semester.\n\nI fully understand that this ultimately boils down to me choosing which I like doing the most and the reason I am asking is because I don't know what it feels like to be in the specific fields that were mentioned. It is also because I am the first generation in my family going for higher education and also the only one doing STEM, therefore I do not have many people to ask for advice. I'd really appreciate any advice at all or different points of views from people that have more experience in the respective fields. I would also be glad to clarify any questions you might have regarding any of this. I will be glad to discuss this through PMs or through the comments! Thank you very much everyone!\n\ntl;dr - I am second year Chemical Engineering Student. I am unsure what to double major in as I have interest in two other majors, Chemistry and Computer Science. Looking for advice from experts in the respective fields. :)",

When I had applied, I was unable to secure an advisor and was given an offer for a course based program.\n\nA few weeks after my admission, a professor had replied back and said he could take me on and transfer me over to research based degree a few months after I’m there, as he’s waiting for some funding. I was all set. The work is exciting enough. I have had minimal contact since where he just mentioned he definitely needs a student by fall and advised me on courses. \n\nHowever, another professor (at the same school) emailed just now and asked me if I’m still interested. This professors work is much more inline with what I want to do.\n\n1. Is it considered unethical to switch? I’m an international student and I’m unaware (outside of plagiarism) what sort of things are considered unethical.\n\n2. Should I email my department dean for advice?\n\n3. Right now I don’t have any info on what the potentially new advisor has lined up project wise. Is it ethical to ask beforehand?\n\nEdit: wanted to add, I may save a significant amount of money by going with the new professor as then I wouldn’t have to pay the course based programs tuition fee for the first semester - as he would transfer me over before I arrive.

        "text": "A while ago, I realized that, compared to research, I feel more satisfied when learning. If this is true, why should I aim to be a researcher? Below are my thoughts on this.\n\nLearning and research both give us the satisfaction of 'knowing' something. The difference might be that, when learning, we consume old knowledge; while research produces new knowledge. Thus, when researching, much work should be done before we can enjoy the satisfaction of 'knowing'. In other words, only research can be a career. Learning, like watching movies or playing games, is to some extent a hobby or a service where you buy products (e.g. movies, games and also *knowledge*) from others' work. If learning simply cannot be a career, the above question vanishes and research might be the only career with the aim of 'knowing'.\n\nOn the other hand, research could be regarded as the next stage of learning. When we are very familiar with a topic, we know the main problems and their solutions, and at certain point, we will naturally come up with an new idea which we believe better, than we deliberate and justify it. And this is research. A major reason why research makes us frustrated might be that, as researchers, we push ourselves to produce more papers, faster, to the extent that we are actually (and perhaps intentionally) not well prepared for the task at hand, and even do something that not really contributes to knowledge.\n\nThus, we are not really more 'satisfied' when learning, but it is the manifestation of two major human weakness: inability and laziness. \n\nDid you also feel this 'satisfaction' and how do you think about it?",

Members of the Coalition for Responsible Sharing include: the American Chemical Society, the American Medical Association, the American Physiological Society, BMJ, Brill, Elsevier, Future Science Group, IEEE, International Water Association, Oxford University Press, Portland Press (wholly-owned by the Biochemical Society), Wiley, Wolters Kluwer, and World Scientific Publishing.\n\nElsevier will send TDNs to ResearchGate to request that they remove PDFs of the final version of papers published in Elsevier Journals. Any articles published as Gold Open Access will of course remain unaffected.\n\nIt is important to note that the TDNs are directed at ResearchGate not at authors. We understand that you may not have personally uploaded this article. This situation requires no action on your part however we felt it important to inform you as a courtesy and to point out that if ResearchGate wrongly hosts a PDF of the final version of your article, it might not be available via the site in the future. We do not take this action lightly and recognise that ResearchGate is a popular platform for researchers.\n\nPublishers have offered user friendly solutions to ResearchGate that would make sharing via its site seamless and easy for researchers while bringing the platform into copyright compliance. ResearchGate has shown no interest in these solutions.\n\nHosting final published articles without permission undermines the long-term sustainability of journals. We are also concerned that ResearchGate undermines the integrity of research by, for instance, altering articles and missing important retractions and corrections.\n\nThe Coalition for Responsible Sharing has provided a statement explaining the action in more detail and has published a list of FAQs. Information on how to share your articles can be found at How Can I Share It.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us at Author-Copyright@elsevier.com.\n\nThank you for publishing in our journal and we look forward to continuing our partnership with you.\n\nKind regards,\"",

Additionally, I dislike the atmosphere my mentor creates around the lab: she is domineering (telling me what I should think and shutting down ideas she disagrees with), and talks badly about other people in the lab behind their backs. However, I have kept my mouth shut regarding my views of her and the work, to the point where I may have hidden how uncomfortable I am too well and she is making plans for future research I could be doing with her.\n\nAs soon as I realized I wasn't planning to move forward with this research, I began attending lab meetings led by another faculty member whose research I am much more interested in. The atmosphere couldn't be more different: everyone listens to each other and builds each other up, and almost immediately accepted me in a way I still haven't really felt accepted in my current lab. This is not just a case of \"the grass is always greener\" - the difference is like night and day. I have talked with the faculty member about a position there in the fall and he says there will definitely be one open if I want it.\n\nSo how can I tell my mentor that I don't want to continue with her research and that I intend to switch into this other lab? I am very conscious of how this could play out as far as letters of recommendation for future positions, because I have worked more closely with my mentor than anybody else and she is highly regarded in this field.
