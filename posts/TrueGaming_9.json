The gameplay isn’t really much to brag about in elden ring except wow its just like Dark Souls. Same with the story for its basically isnt there. THe whole game is just a theme with Bosses, not really a world builded game, just a game with bosses thats it and saying \"Yeah but there are lore written in items and piece of paper\" - *Elden D Riders*. Isnt real world building or story. Its bare f-ing minimum. The map isn’t cool, the bosses are bare minimum and many are just reskinned as other bosses.\n\nWhile GOWR did flesh out a story fitted for the game and even managed to subvert expectation from the previous game. There are fleshed out stories from all characters. Real personalities and actual world building. The Game checked every box and Elden Ring has nothing on it, but still won the GOTY for no real reason. It didn’t have to force you to farm, you actually need to be good in this game. For Elden Ring you can just farm and not do a lot thats not a game thats just stupid.\n\nThats just my Facts for you.",

        "text": "The last The Game Awards was a great thing. I was doubting in it, and indeed, so many awards were taken by God of War: Ragnarok... but Elden Ring having the game of the year award was a beautiful mirror to TGA 2018, when Red Dead Redemption II took all the awards, but the main one was given to God of War. **Even though everything was great, I noticed one thing: the most of the categories were mostly made after more cinematic standards while** ***game*** **awards could be much deeper.**\n\nI mean, games are games because they're interactive. They offer different playstyles, different levels, different game mechanics. People not just watch them or listen to them, but actually play them, interact with them. Different game award events don't pay attention to it almost completely. **The idea of my post is that there should be nominations that would award games for being good in certain game mechanics, both stable and traditional or new and groundbreaking.** For example, there could be nominations of:\n\n* The best melee combat;\n* The best shooter mechanics;\n* The best stealth;\n* The best craft;\n* The best user interface;\n* The best linear level design;\n* The best open world design;\n* The best endgame content;\n* The best unpredictable game mechanic;\n\n...and so on - and I also tried to be realistic about what categories are important or not. \n\nInstead, we have also good awards such as the best writing or the best music which are also important, but, as I said, they're more into cinematic field. There are even awards which reflect the modern idea of inclusivity and care, such as awards for social message or awards for accessibility. However, almost nothing of this reflects the gameplay itself. **Still, there are many developers who do their best to experiment with gameplay or who bring joy to people through it's details - and both.** \n\nI'm not trying to change the world with my post, but I simply think that rating the actual details of gameplay may be interesting, fair and maybe even changeful. **Many people are expressing an opinion that modern big games do not experiment, so maybe these categories can be a motivation for them to do so.** Even if not, however, it's still can be a good guide through \"points of gameplay interest\" of a certain year.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zslamb/im_very_optimistic_about_the_future_of_game_dev/",
        "text": "We aren't there yet, but this is my vision of my (closer than you may think) future of gaming...\n\nImagine you wake up one day and had this amazing idea about the concept for a game regarding a monkey with a funny hat that fights against an evil empire composed by antropormophic crocodiles. But you aren't a programmer, you aren't an artist, modeler, sound technician nor writer and definitely not a millionaire, how could you bring that concept into a tangible product?\n\nWell, you start by going to an AIChat specifically trained into game concepts and discuss and fine tune the idea with its help.\nThen you go into an image generator AI and produce some conceptual arts. It feels great to see your idea evolving and becoming a possibility. \nYou then feed the concept arts into another AI, that gives you 3D models with perfect topology, UVs and textures. You fine tune the models it using some AI tools in Blender (I imagine it as painting a zone of the model and then add a textual prompt like \"give it bat wings in this zone\" or \"goat's horns here\"). Then you think for a moment what kind of shader you'll like and decide the one that suits your game better is a hyper realistic one. You create it easily with a few clicks.\nThen, you bring that model into a more advanced version of Cascadeur, that works though text prompts for creating realistic animations. Something like \"give it a walking cycle\" or \"make him scratch his back while making a funny gesture with the mouth\".\nAfter that, it's programming time. A specialized engine powered by AI helps with that. You just choose the genre and decide the mechanics, in minutes it creates the necessary scripts, databases, everything you may need. The final step is music, sound effects and voices, all created by AI with a great quality indistinguishable from a AAA studio. \nAnd you have it, you created the game in a few days of work instead of the years it currently would take, and the result are of an excellent quality.\n\nNow, that version of the future makes me very happy and excited. Why? The first reason is a very personal one, as I have always wanted to create games since I was a kid, but life took me into a different path and now, as a 37 years old, I lack the free time to learn to use the required tools to make it a reality. I have some ideas for concepts from time to time though, and it saddens me the fact that those concepts live only in my mind and die a few years afterwards. But it's not only me in that situation, I believe most gamers have at least once in their life had an idea for a game, correct me if you never have one, at least something like \"wouldn't it be cool if this game I'm playing did X thing differently?\" I believe that thanks to AI technologies, we'll be able to make these ideas a reality. \n\nNow, wouldn't that create a over saturation of the market? What would the long term effects of this be? In my opinion, it will bring only positive changes to the medium, let me explain.\n\nCurrently, the gaming market is divided in two. In one side you have the AAA studios that invest big money and own recognizable IPs. Their target audience is the broader amount of gamers posible as they need to recover the money inversion, thus don't take risks where they can't have guaranteed sucess and generally won't satisfy gamers that have niche interests. But thanks to the amount of money these studios invest, these games have huge production value, photorealistic graphics with the latest advances in technology, reallife like animations, voice actors from Hollywood, excellent/famous writers, etc\nOn the other, you have indie studios/solo devs. People that have a passion for gaming strong enough that they endure years or decades making reality their dream game. They understand the community like the suits never will, have novel ideas, take huge risks and target niche audiences. But since they don't have the skills or money, they don't have as big production value as the big studios. They have to resort to graphic styles like pixelart or low poly or make the voices of the characters themselves or use low quality music, etc \n\nI know some developers do choose those styles because they do indeed like them. I too have nostalgia for the SNES, N64 and PS1 era of gaming and they can definitely look great, that's not what I'm saying here, I'm speaking about those that would like to use a different more realistic style but literally can't because of skills, time or money constraints.\n\nOne of the positive changes in the industry this technology will bring, is the democratization and globalization of the game designer rol. As a citizen from a Third World Country (Uruguay) it is no surprise that the biggest gaming in the world are from First World Countries: China, Japan, Wester Europe, USA and Canada. Yes, there are some AA or indie companies from other regions, but that is due to change thanks to this technology and it's something extremely positive. Imagine the diversity (true diversity, not the woke American use of it) that would come to the medium once everybody who had an idea and access to a computer with internet (I know in some regions of the world that is still a high bar, but much lower than the current one) could easily create by themselves their dream game. How is this not amazing? People from India, Eastern Europe, Africa, South America creating high production AAA games? It's a dream come true for us.\n\nNow, about the saturation of the market. I don't see as intrinsically a bad thing, the AAA will invest millions on marketing and try to suck their IPs as much as possible, while those batch of AI generated games will earn fame thanks to the mouth to mouth and influencers suggestions. Gamers that like niche genres will have plenty of high quality options to choose and the competition for the general casual audience will be brutal, we as gamers will only benefit from that! Big companies will need to adapt, reduce their prices or actually develop excellent games that people enjoy when the competition becomes this big...\n\nAnd then, a new niche will be born, it will be called \"human-made assets\" or something like that. Games that don't use AI technologies, they will surely have a following and some great developers will release masterpieces in that style. \n\nThis is what I envision, and it excites me a lot that is a very close future, I give it no more than 5 years to happen as a lot of the things I mentioned are already in the year 2022 happening and it's a technology that it's advancing really fast.\n\nThanks for reading, and excuse me if my English isn't perfect, as I said, I'm Uruguayan and English isn't my first language. Let me know what you think about this, am I being naivety optimistic? Is there some fault in my logic? You agree with what I said?",

This is a franchise that despite being in it's infancy at Sony, not the studio they've been at the helm of their own Killzone franchise at Sony.... Has already greenlit and is working on a Horizon universe. HZD + HFW + VR + a co-op and then I think 2 other games also in  research/production, there's even an official podcast. This franchise has already created a looming shadow on GOW\n\nSo when it comes to the whole GOTY nominations and its the least discussed game Im a little confused. I mean this is the game that redesigned a middle-earth adventure with our own planet, hauntingly beautiful alt-history in the future. The game that let traverse the map however you see fit, expansive underwater coral reefs, descending into caves, deserts, islands, forests, city ruins, frozen wilds ;) \n\nAlso you can fly, not just glide with glider like BOTw, you can mount a pterodactyl and traverse the map, so much more meaningful than fast-travel. This studio let you traverse the land, sea and sky in an already deeply lored rpg game. And I think they will obviously get their flowers soon, if not with their current games maybe the 3rd game in the entry will do it. Their upcoming DLC also happens to be PS5 only, so we can expect the unexpected for their future third-installment",

        "text": "Capitalism is not something that is often discussed in the gaming community but should be. If you press a gamer enough you'll most likely find anti-capitalist tendencies at least related to games.\n\nThings like loot boxes, yearly ish releases (COD, Assassins Creed, etc.) with little difference to offer, unfinished games, content behind paywalls/dlc roadmaps announced with release, crunch on the workers behind the games, lack of creativity from many larger studios, attempts to appeal to wider audiences in turn leaving a void for specific niche type games that indie studios may lack the budget.\n\nSomething like the patent on the nemesis system (a system that has been built off many other systems over the years within a game that takes ideas and mechanics from others) or the recent ousting of the main people behind Disco Elysium which unless they regain the rights back will have any sequel or media (TV show apparently) totally void of what makes the game a masterpiece.\n\nDo gamers need to accept that the majority of the industry is actively out to rip us off? Now yes we do get some great games but much of the industry is anti-consumer. Games leaning into addictive mechanics/aimed at specific audiences like young kids who will not be able to see or resist such tactics (how often have you heard of a kid spending money on V bucks or Shark Cards?). Or why is it I can pre order Vampire The Masquerade 2 that has been in development/canceled for years now? Or the fiasco with Bethesda selling a cheap bag that was marketed as a quality item. I'm sure others can provide all types of examples. \n\nWhat would the gaming industry look like if it were to be for the gamers by the gamers? Would approaches to game development such as public funding or cooperative groups yield better gaming experiences? My point of view is that aside from the capitol used to build AAA games, these investors have no idea what or how to create games that are more than mere distractions. \n\nGames can be art, they can express different human experiences or connect people who would otherwise may never engage with, not that having a simple fun time with little thought is inherently wrong but the industry being controlled by capitalist interests does not provide much room for anything more. The continued acquisition of studios by Microsoft and others may appear to bring more to the table for gamers but are only monopolizing the industry further and not mean better quality games. Gamers need to be more political conscious to what is going on or we will fade away into the freemium/microtransactions/glitched/poorly written abyss.\n\nAlso if this somewhat triggers any pro-capitalist gamers in the community, feel free to give a different take on the topic.",

        "text": "I've watched a bunch of streams; videos read a lot of reviews; discussions; comments. And the consensus is very clear. High on Life isn't a game for everybody. And while that's true, I think a lot of that all hinged on the decision to give players the freedom to choose the pace of the story.\n\nTake for example the office of moplets in the Krubis bounty mission. After finishing a qte of document signing, you are told that you may continue forward to see Krubis. Naturally, you walk forward and out the door. Most will go on none the wiser that they skipped over a great amount of strange dialogue involving a love triangle in the office &gt;! Inevitably ending with your decision of whether murder them all.&lt;! This decision seemingly comes to return later on when you encounter the &gt;! moplet who witnessed everything and calls security on you.!&lt;\nAll of that effort on a comedic payout that all bet on the player patiently seeking dialogue.\n\nIt made me realize something. Many RPGs aren't about watching a story play out, you aren't a spectator to the outcome, you are one of the actors who helps push the story forward. Another character building the immersion of this universe. And for better or worse the freedom that's become the norm in so many games, when applied to a game like this, it places too much faith that a person playing the game will play it as it was intended. Playing their part in the role they're given. \n\nThe result? A game with so many hidden gem moments; tongue and cheek interactions with fantastic dialogue... That can be completely cut from the game all depending on how willing you were to not pull the trigger or not continue forward and instead just wait. Not to mention the warp disc's which I didn't even know to collect Crystal for until at least halfway through the game.\n\nRegardless, I enjoyed many of the payouts for the waiting or comedic timing on shooting npcs. Which makes it difficult to give a solution. The content that was hidden or easy to skip was the most rewarding to encounter. But when a single decision in game design can change the perception of a game so much, it makes me wonder if it's just inexperience in the dev team or the reason why so many game companies resist making the player struggle and hard games have a specific dedicated fan base.\n\n\nI really enjoyed High on Life. It was very flawed, but if you can sit down and really take time to enjoy the details, it's very fun.\n\nThe shooting was stale for me though.",

        "text": "I’m currently playing a game that’s desperately in need of a fast travel system (Technomancer), and it’s got me thinking about how RPGs could implement fast travel in ways that don’t discourage players from exploring their worlds.\n\nMany modern games let you unlock fast travel once you’ve visited a location, but then you can just teleport to that place from anywhere from then on. I think this could be implemented in a more intelligent way by tracking the paths you’ve taken (think BotW Hero’s Path), and only allowing you to skip travel that retreads these paths (possibly with a travel montage a la RDR2 to retain immersion).\n\nFor example: you’ve trekked a path from the starting zone of an RPG to a village to the north, bought some provisions and made your way to pillage some ruins to the east of town. Once you’re done with your quest there you can skip the trek back to the village, but in order to get back to the starting zone you’d need to walk there, or fast travel from town. You’d have to implement some kind of cost to fast travel to give the incentive to forge new paths to keep it efficient of course.\n\nThe goal is to avoid retreading the same ground over and over (if you want), while encouraging players to explore the world between travel points. It’s half baked, but there it is. Let me know why this is dumb, or if you have any other creative ideas to solve these types of issues!",
