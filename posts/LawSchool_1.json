Obviously this tech brings up new, necessary questions about the bar (why isn‚Äôt it open book and not a week long take home test).\n\nI think what it‚Äôs signaling is that lawyers will have larger work loads and more clients. And depending on the cost (there‚Äôs no way GPT is going to stay free) it might help smaller firms produce more content.

I don't think I'm overloading myself (only 14 credit hours), but I would like some input to help me gauge if I'm making an alright decision with the information I have. Thanks!! \n\nI current have the following class in my shopping cart:\n\n1) Evidence (4 cr) (Required at my school) (Not sure whether the final is open/closed, but the professor comes recommended and has a good rating on Rate My Professor). \n\n2) Criminal Procedure (3 cr) (Likely open book/note for the final, and I have this teacher currently for Criminal Law and like her). \n\n3) Trial Practice (3 cr) (Likely paper as a final) (Will also count towards my 6 cr experiential learning requirement to graduate). \n\n4) Law Review Candidacy (2 cr) (Will also count towards my writing requirement to graduate) (Obviously contingent on me getting on Law Review).\n\n5) Professional Responsibility (2 cr) (synchronous) (required at my school) (I've had the teacher before and she was pretty cool). \n\nThe only required course that I would have left after this fall semester is Administrative Law, which I would take the following semester in spring 2024. After that, I was thinking over my final 3 semesters that I would take electives + around 3 bar courses, a bar prep course, finish out my experiential learning requirement, and a directed reading with one of my favorite professors, which we already discussed doing. \n\nAgain, thanks for any feedback!",

        "text": "Hi guys, I'm taking the MPRE in the next few weeks (March 2023 test), and I had a few questions about MPRE prep.\n\nI initially planned to use Themis but after speaking with law school friends and looking through MPRE-related posts on Reddit, I decided to switch to Barbri for learning the MPRE content (seems like it's more comprehensive) but do practice questions for both Themis (seems more similar to the actual MPRE exam) and Barbri. Does this seem like a good plan?\n\nFor those who have used Barbri, did you find it necessary to also read the substantive outlines in addition to watching the lectures? So far, the lectures feel pretty comprehensive, and I was wondering if I could just skip reading the outlines and just watch all the lectures and move onto the practice questions for Themis/Barbri. Any thoughts/insights would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "Is it really worth going to law school if you‚Äôre not actually sure you ever want to practice?\n\nInterested to know everybody‚Äôs thoughts. I‚Äôm located outside of the US so not sure how common this is in countries other than my own, but I know of so many people with law degrees who never practiced, and ended up in a totally different field of work, or they pursued law as a degree simply because it‚Äôs a prestigious qualification, which means it opens a whole bunch of doors other than just becoming a practicing lawyer. \n\nI‚Äôm just curious to hear if people think it‚Äôs actually worth going through all the trials and tribulations of law school only to end up not really utilising the degree to what some people might consider to be its ‚Äúfull potential‚Äù.\n\nFor the record, I‚Äôm not talking about people who began their degree with the intention of practicing and then changed their minds part way through but got their qualification anyway, and then went into another field of work with it. I mean getting a law degree either without the intention to practice at all, or without really knowing what you actually want to do with it, but just getting it for the sake of having a distinguished degree that will give them a wider expanse of career opportunities. \n\nAny thoughts?",
