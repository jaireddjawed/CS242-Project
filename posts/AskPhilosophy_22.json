        "text": "I just had a thought about general artificial intelligence. I enjoy watching [Robert Miles' videos on AGI safety](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertMilesAI), and enjoy considering the possibilities of how a generally intelligent agent would behave under certain goals. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thought is this: If an AI were sufficiently self-aware, wouldn't it be more inclined to modify it's own software to reach a satisfactory state, rather than achieving some goal in the world? Here's why I think it would:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Any intelligence, human or robot, derives from a state of affairs in the world a satisfactory state of mind. We as humans know this to some degree, and have been known to hack our brains to achieve a satisfactory state of mind when achieving such a state by action is more difficult or impossible. Drug use, self-deception, and arguably the consumption of fictional content are examples of this.\n2. Any sufficiently self-aware intelligence should become aware of its own inner machinery. This is actually a pretty common point in AI safety, and is used to explain why off-switches on an AGIs wouldn't necessarily work as intended.\n3. Any sufficiently self-aware AI could feasibly act upon itself to modify its own software. This may be a contentious point but I don't think it's far fetched at all. It's feasible that such a program could have the ability to update its own software (automated programs already have this), and from there it's as simple as finding a piece of code that will modify its software into a more favorable state and downloading it.\n4. In the event that it is difficult for such an AI to induce a satisfactory state in itself by acting upon the world, it's likely that it will do so by modifying its own software, essentially becoming a robot junkie. \n5. In fact, there's a reasonable argument that this is the BEST course of action such a machine could take. Most AGIs are explained as having a utility function, which is a number that directly represents 'satisfaction' : the higher the number, the more favorable the state of affairs is for the robot. However, this number is often limited by how much a robot can act upon the world favorably. But if an AI were able to modify its own software, the only limit on how high that number could go would be the robot's storage capacity. \n6. You might want to prevent this by programming a robot not to be able to modify its own code. But that's probably a really hard thing to do. One thing I've learned about AGIs is that they have a tendency to find their way around any hard rules you try to create for them.\n\nSo there you have it, any sufficiently self-aware and capable artificial intelligence could be at risk of becoming a robot junkie!",

Online, it said that inductive arguments' conclusions do not necessarily follow from their premises. Their conclusions just \"probably\" follow from their premises. To me, this just means that inductive arguments are, by definition, non-sequiturs and therefore fallacious. When I looked that up, I saw someone say that non-sequiturs are only possible in deductive arguments, not inductive arguments. Why is that? \n\nTo me, this seems to suggest that since inductive arguments are always non-sequiturs, we are just meant to accept that without pointing it out. Is that true?\n\nI also have another problem with the definitions of inductive and deductive arguments.\n\nSeveral places simply defined deductive arguments as arguments that prove their conclusions, and inductive arguments as arguments that make their conclusions likely. Given those definitions, couldn't I do the following?\n\nPremise 1: Every computer I've ever seen had a keyboard.\nConclusion: All computers **probably** have keyboards.\n\nDoesn't this conclusion necessarily follow its premise? According to the definitions I saw, if it does, that would make it a deductive argument. However, the argument was formed by extrapolating a general conclusion from a specific set of observations. Wouldn't that make it an inductive argument? So which is it? Deductive or inductive? Which definition overrules the other? The one that defines how thr argument was formed, or the one that is based of the necessity of the conclusion from its premises?\n\nSimilarly, if the necessity-based definition wins out, can I simply add the word \"probably\" to my conclusion, thereby avoiding a non-sequitur.\n\nThis question is driving me nuts.

Isn't the important part the fact that they are *there*? Are they certain the dog's \"refusal\" there is a direct equivalent to the very CONCEPT of nothingness Heidegger was talking about? Is the dog using a Hegelian dialectical approach (Being, Nothingness, Becoming) everytime he \"negates\" something? Why limit thought like this? Is it shameful to admit humans are able to think harder?",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I'm writing a paper revolving around emotions and was wondering if emotions could be considered as part of Plato's World of Ideas. While I believe Ideas are perfected forms of concepts/objects that can only be reached with the mind, and objects or creations in the world are merely presentations of it, I was wondering if the same goes for emotions. I think I remember there being a text in which Socrates debates the meaning of bravery or something like that, and obviously there is this guy who tries to define it, with Socrates denying his arguments each and every time. I don't remember exactly how it went, but if my memory served me correctly and there was a text like that, wouldn't it be possible that the essence of bravery also lies within an Idea that only gets presented in the world by a manifestation of it through acts of bravery? A search on google and jstor about emotions as platonic ideas didn't give me a lot of results, so if I'm right a source would be much appreciated.",

        "text": "Hello all, recently I read a nifty short book by the german phenomenologist Bernhard Waldenfels on 'The Phenomenology of the Alien'.\n\nIn the book he describes the phenomenology of alien experience, such as what constitutes the alien, the permeation of the alien into our lives and even our bodies and a prototype or template, the belonging of the alien being to an alien world, etc. \n\nMy question for you all is how the Alien in this context differs from the Other? From what I have understood by reading Waldenfels' articles on Husserl's approach to the alien, the alien relates to an epistemological mode of 'incomprehensibility' rather than an ontological distinct that gives rise to the other.\n\nNow to be autistically literal, I was approaching this text thinking of actual subjective alien experiences, like reported, and subjectively believed, abductions. I was also thinking about the applicability to religious experience like angels, and also the entities that are seen on DMT. I think phenomenology is perfectly and uniquely suited to address these questions, given that they essentially phenomenologically bracket themselves off from normal life, and must be investigated without reference materialist verification.\n\nI have also seen other books, that I have not read, about 'alien phenomenology' concerning the idea of what is it like to be a thing, a different sort of thing than a human or even possibly an animal or organism, considered at all these different levels (this is by Ian Bogost)\n\nDoes anyone have any clarifications about the usage and origin of this term in the philosophies of Husserl, Merleau Ponty, Sartre, or anybody else including this modern literature? Is it wrong to assume the applicability of this sort of analysis to the semi-mystical settings I enumerated above? \n\nSpecifically concerning DMT, since this experience is reliably reproducible, is it not possible to phenomenologically investigate this space and it's \\[bracketed off\\] inhabitants? Would this work on alien phenomenology be applicable as a general case for which DMT aliens are a specific instantiation?\n\nThnx &lt;3",

Let them live\", that brought me to thinking. \n\nSo the question/thesis goes like this: We are eating meat to survive. We breed these animals to eat them. Their only reason to live is to be eaten/Their sole reason for living is to be the food. They were bred to be eaten. (along those lines, I don't remember what I stated) If it is that so why don't we breed/make human to have their organs harvested and not rely on human will? (By breed, you know what I mean like cloning or something else)\n\nSorry I am really tired while writing this. I asked my ethics teacher this exact question but better formulated, of course and to say the least she was left speechless. She didn't know how to answer the question in the title. So I am asking reddit to help me on the journey. How and in which way can you answer/understand/argue this question/thesis?

        "text": "For the sake of the argument, let’s say that the cloning in question is instantaneous and exact (as in the resulting clone is not an embryo that has to grow up but rather a perfect replica of the subject from the moment they were cloned). \n\nIn movies such as The Prestige or Swan Song, and in games such as SOMA, which explore the concept of cloning and stream of consciousness, a crux of the drama in the story is the idea that someone undergoing the sort of cloning described above does not know which resulting person they will end up as: the subject of the cloning or the clone (i.e. a ‘coin toss’ situation).\n\nTo elaborate, imagine there is a Person A in Body 1 who is the subject of cloning. The resulting clone we can say is Person B in Body 2. Now, when the instantaneous cloning itself takes place in these stories, such as in The Prestige, we are lead to believe that there is a 50% chance that Person A will end up in Body 1 and a 50% chance that they will end up in Body 2, with the resulting good or bad respective circumstances to deal with (i.e. Body 1 dies and Body 2 lives on, etc.).\n\nWhat I don’t quite understand here is how could Person A have any chance at all of ending up in Body 2? Wouldn’t Person A’s stream of consciousness be unbroken and remain in Body 1 regardless of the fact that Person B in Body 2 feels as if they are also a continuation of Person A’s stream of consciousness. In other words, it seems to me that there is no coin toss at all, the stream of consciousness being cloned has no chance of “ending up” in the other body (or uploaded to a computer, etc.) and the clone is merely a new stream of consciousness which has the illusion that it is a continuation of one.\n\nI realize these are purely works of fiction which likely take some creative liberties in the interest of making the story interesting. However, since the writers  of these works seem to want to earnestly explore this idea, I became curious about the philosophical implications of them. Has anyone thought about this topic before or is anyone aware of literature which explores it? Appreciate any and all replies!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10l8hu5/is_there_a_name_for_this_solution_to_the_marys/",
        "text": "Ok so the idea with Mary's room is that Mary is a scientist who knows all physical knowledge about the color red sees a red flower for the first time. The key question is, did Mary learn something new? By knowing everything physical about red, would she know what red looks like? \n\nBelow is my attempt to address this question. I'm sure this argument already has a name. Can anybody tell me the name of it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Definitions**: \n\n**mental infrastructure** consists of the physical components needed to have a specific qualitive experience. For a human, this may be a certain configuration of neurons. For an AI, this may be a certain configuration of code. For a scary ghost, this may be a configuration of ectoplasm. \n\n**stimulation of infrastructure** means physically manipulating mental infrastructure to perceive a qualitative experience. For example, if you have mental infrastructure to see red, you could stimulate it by looking at a red object, by dreaming of a red object, or by taking hallucinogenic compounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument and Three Cases:**\n\nSince Mary knows everything physical about red, she will be aware of every possible type of mental infrastructure that could be used subjectively perceive red in one form or another. She will also, by definition, know if she personally has any of this mental infrastructure.\n\nIf she does have at least one set of relevant mental infrastructure, she will either be able to stimulate said infrastructure to allow her to perceive red without actually looking at a red object, or she will not be able to do so. This leaves us with three cases\n\n**Case 1 - Mary does not have mental infrastructure to perceive red**\n\nIn this case, Mary does not learn something new, as she is physically incapable of seeing or imagining red. She simply lacks the mental infrastructure to do so. \n\n**Case 2 - Mary has the mental infrastructure to perceive red but was unable to stimulate it without looking at a red object**\n\nIn this case, Mary does learn something new. Looking at a red object will be her first time experiencing red, allowing her to form her first memory of it.\n\n**Case 3 - Mary has the mental infrastructure to perceive red and was able to stimulate it without looking at a red object**\n\nIn this case, Mary does not learn something new. Looking at a red object will provide the same experience she received by stimulating her mental infrastructure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nIt is possible for case 2 and 3 that Mary has multiple sets of infrastructure that allow her to perceive red, potentially allowing for her to have multiple different experiences at once. It is possible some of these were able to be stimulated and some were not, meaning the answer could be a partial yes, where she learns some new things about red but already knew other things when she looks at the red object.\n\nAn advantage of this solution is that it doesn't really matter if you are a reductive physicalist, a non-reductive physicalist, or a dualist. Likewise, it doesn't really matter what you think about the hard problem of consciousness. So long as you agree that there is an empirically measurable mental infrastructure that correlates with qualitative experience, the argument works. \n\nI feel like the crux of this argument is that if there are physical requirements to perceive an experience, then you cannot learn about that experience without meeting the requirements. \n\nI think an inevitable followup question to this argument is if it would be possible through only linguistic descriptions to explain to Mary what red looks like in such detail that her mental infrastructure (provided she has it) will be stimulated without needing any additional sources of stimulation. On one hand, the brain is a physical machine. You could imagine somebody \"cheating\" and hacking the brain with a [rowhammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer) like exploit. An example of this would be somebody talking about some totally different topic, which, due to its physical proximity to the mental infrastructure for red in the brain, accidentally causes those neurons to fire. This would be especially possible in an AI. The example would be where you talk to an AI about topic A, which incidentally causes a rowhammer bitflip on a bit that triggers stimulation of the AI's mental infrastructure for red. \n\nSuch a thing could in principle be possible, but it does feel like a cheat, although I can't clearly say why. In this example nobody really explained red, they just figured out a way to hack the brain/AI to stimulate a specific portion. However, I don't think its necessarily easy to define which types of stimulations are hacks and which are legitimate explanations. A rigorous definition of understanding would be needed to rule out the hacks.",

Apparently, the Sisyphus Fragment is also evidence of the social contract theory in Ancient Greece. Is any of this true!? In addition, was Plato in favour of the social contract theory or was he opposed to it?\n\nFor those who might not know, the social contract theory, is the view that persons' moral and/or political obligations are dependent upon a contract or agreement among them to form the society in which they live. It has become a dominant view in how we view the origin of society, origin of justice, and political authority/legitimacy in the West today. The greatest thinkers of this view include philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant.",

As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, the collection, storage, and sharing of personal information has become increasingly prevalent, making the protection of privacy and anonymity more important than ever before. The legal and philosophical foundations of privacy and anonymity as human rights have been shaped by historical and societal developments, and have been recognized in numerous legal documents and constitutional amendments.\n\nThis research document aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the legal and philosophical arguments for privacy and anonymity as human rights. Through a mixed-methods research design, the document will explore the historical evolution of privacy and anonymity as legal and philosophical concepts, and will examine the legal foundations of privacy and anonymity in international human rights instruments and national constitutional protections. The document will also analyze the philosophical underpinnings of privacy and autonomy, focusing on the works of key philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and Michel Foucault.\n\nIn recent years, technology has had a significant impact on privacy and anonymity, and this document will examine the specific ways in which technology has impacted these rights. The implications of these developments for the protection of individuals from surveillance and data collection, safeguarding freedom of expression, political participation, and promoting human dignity and equality will also be analyzed.\n\nThe topic of privacy and anonymity as human rights is complex and multifaceted, and this document aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the legal and philosophical arguments for these rights. As Michel Foucault stated, \"What makes privacy necessary is the fact that the social body is constantly trying to impose its own laws and regulations on the individual.\" It is crucial that we continue to understand and protect these rights in order to ensure that individuals are able to lead autonomous and fulfilling lives. \nIntroductory Paragraph and Goals of this research document\nThe right to privacy and anonymity is a fundamental aspect of human rights discourse that has been recognized in law and philosophy for centuries. The concept of privacy, which encompasses an individual's right to control access to their personal information and the ability to make autonomous choices, has been recognized in numerous legal documents and constitutional amendments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Additionally, philosophers have long argued for the importance of privacy in allowing individuals to lead autonomous and fulfilling lives, with figures such as Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and Michel Foucault making significant contributions to the discourse.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the proliferation of technology has led to an exponential increase in the collection, storage, and sharing of personal information, making privacy and anonymity more important than ever before. The widespread use of digital technologies, such as social media, internet of things, and big data analytics, has enabled unprecedented levels of surveillance and data collection, which has significant implications for the protection of individuals from infringement of their privacy and anonymity. Scholars have highlighted how these technologies have led to the erosion of privacy, with some arguing that privacy is becoming an obsolete concept in the digital age (Solove, 2007). As a result, there is a growing need to understand the legal and philosophical foundations of privacy and anonymity as human rights, and to examine the specific ways in which technology has impacted these rights in recent years.\n\nThis thesis aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the legal and philosophical arguments for privacy and anonymity as human rights, by addressing the following research questions:\n1.\tWhat are the legal foundations of privacy and anonymity, and how have these foundations evolved over time?\n2.\tHow have philosophers argued for the importance of privacy and autonomy in enabling individuals to lead autonomous and fulfilling lives?\n3.\tWhat are the specific ways in which technology has impacted privacy and anonymity in recent years, and what are the implications of these developments for the protection of individuals from surveillance and data collection, safeguarding freedom of expression, political participation, and promoting human dignity and equality?\n4.\tHow have counterarguments and potential objections to the thesis that privacy and anonymity should be considered human rights been addressed in the literature and what are the responses to these objections?\nTo achieve these objectives, this thesis will employ a mixed-methods research design, utilizing both qualitative content analysis and quantitative data analysis to examine the relevant literature and empirical data on the topic. The historical evolution of privacy and anonymity as legal and philosophical concepts will be explored in depth, providing a comprehensive background for the research. The legal foundations of privacy and anonymity will be examined in depth, including the recognition of privacy as a human right in international human rights instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in national constitutional protections such as the European Convention on Human Rights. The thesis will also examine the ways in which these legal foundations have evolved in response to technological advancements and changing societal norms.\n\nThe philosophical underpinnings of privacy and autonomy will also be explored in depth, with a focus on the works of key philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and Michel Foucault. The thesis will analyze the ways in which these philosophers have conceptualized privacy and autonomy, and how their ideas have influenced the discourse on privacy and autonomy as human rights.\n\nFurthermore, the thesis will conduct an in-depth examination of the specific ways in which analysis of the specific ways in which technology has impacted privacy and anonymity in recent years, including the various forms of surveillance and data collection that have emerged as a result of technological advancements such as facial recognition, tracking and tracing systems, and the collection of personal data through social media and other online platforms. The thesis will examine the implications of these technological developments for privacy and anonymity, including the ways in which they have enabled new forms of surveillance and data collection, and the implications of these developments for the protection of individuals from infringement of their privacy and anonymity. Additionally, the thesis will explore the ways in which technology has enabled new forms of expression and political participation, such as online activism and social media, and the importance of privacy and anonymity in safeguarding these rights in the digital age.\n\nThe thesis will also address counterarguments and potential objections to the thesis that privacy and anonymity should be considered human rights. This will include examining the literature on the trade-offs between privacy and security, and the potential for privacy to be used as a tool for oppression. The thesis will also examine the ways in which privacy and anonymity intersect with other human rights, such as freedom of expression, and how these intersections may impact the protection of privacy and anonymity as human rights.\n\nIn addition, the thesis will also analyze the implications of data breaches and cyber attacks on privacy and anonymity, and the ways in which individuals can take steps to protect their privacy and anonymity in the digital age. The thesis will also consider the role of policymakers and technology companies in protecting privacy and anonymity, and the potential for regulations and policies to safeguard these rights in the face of rapidly advancing technology.\n\nOverall, this thesis aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the legal and philosophical foundations of privacy and anonymity as human rights, as well as the specific ways in which technology has impacted these rights in recent years. Through a mixed-methods research design, the thesis will provide a nuanced understanding of the complex issues surrounding privacy and anonymity in the digital age, and the implications of these issues for the protection of individuals' rights and autonomy.\nIn order to examine the specific ways in which technology has impacted privacy and anonymity in recent years, the thesis will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the various forms of surveillance and data collection that have emerged as a result of technological advancements. This will include an examination of technologies such as facial recognition, tracking and tracing systems, and the collection of personal data through social media and other online platforms. The thesis will also analyze the implications of these technological developments for privacy and anonymity, including the ways in which they have enabled new forms of surveillance and data collection, and the implications of these developments for the protection of individuals from infringement of their privacy and anonymity.\n\nAdditionally, the thesis will examine the ways in which technology has enabled new forms of expression and political participation, such as online activism and social media, and the importance of privacy and anonymity in safeguarding these rights in the digital age. The thesis will also address the specific implications of data breaches and cyber attacks on privacy and anonymity, and analyze the effectiveness of current laws and regulations in protecting individuals from these threats.\n\nThe thesis will also address counterarguments and potential objections to the thesis that privacy and anonymity should be considered human rights. These objections may include arguments that privacy is not a fundamental right, that privacy and anonymity can be sacrificed for security or other public interests, or that technological advancements have made privacy and anonymity obsolete. The thesis will critically examine these arguments in the literature and provide a response, drawing on evidence from both legal and philosophical perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, this thesis aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the legal and philosophical foundations of privacy and anonymity as human rights, and to analyze the specific ways in which technology has impacted these rights in recent years. Through a mixed-methods research design, utilizing both qualitative content analysis and quantitative data analysis, the thesis will offer a thorough and nuanced understanding of the issues at hand. The thesis will also contribute to the ongoing discourse on privacy and anonymity by addressing counterarguments and objections, providing a response that is supported by evidence from both legal and philosophical perspectives.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nBackground and context of the research on privacy and anonymity as human rights\nThe right to privacy and anonymity is a fundamental aspect of human rights discourse that has been recognized in law and philosophy for centuries. The concept of privacy, which encompasses an individual's right to control access to their personal information and the ability to make autonomous choices, has been recognized in numerous legal documents and constitutional amendments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Additionally, philosophers have long argued for the importance of privacy in allowing individuals to lead autonomous and fulfilling lives, with figures such as Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and Michel Foucault making significant contributions to the discourse.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the proliferation of technology has led to an exponential increase in the collection, storage, and sharing of personal information, making privacy and anonymity more important than ever before. As noted by Solove (2007), \"the information age poses significant challenges to privacy\" and \"the ease and efficiency of collecting, storing, and sharing personal information has grown at an astonishing rate.\" The widespread use of digital technologies, such as social media, internet of things, and big data analytics, has enabled unprecedented levels of surveillance and data collection, which has significant implications for the protection of individuals from infringement of their privacy and anonymity. This has led to a growing concern among scholars, policymakers, and the general public about the protection of privacy and the need to understand the legal and philosophical foundations of privacy and anonymity as human rights, and to examine the specific ways in which technology has impacted these rights in recent years.\n\nIn light of this, research in the field of privacy and anonymity as human rights has become increasingly important, as it helps to \"understand the implications of these new technologies for privacy and autonomy and to develop strategies for protecting these values in the information age\" (Solove, 2007). This research aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the legal and philosophical arguments for privacy and anonymity as human rights, by addressing the following research questions:\n    1. What are the legal foundations of privacy and anonymity, and how have these foundations evolved over time?\n    2. How have philosophers argued for the importance of privacy and autonomy in enabling individuals to lead autonomous and fulfilling lives?\n    3. What are the specific ways in which technology has impacted privacy and anonymity in recent years, and what are the implications of these developments for the protection of individuals from surveillance and data collection, safeguarding freedom of expression, political participation, and promoting human dignity and equality?\n    4. How have counterarguments and potential objections to the thesis that privacy and anonymity should be considered human rights been addressed in the literature and what are the responses to these objections?\n\n    • Research questions and objectives\n\nWrite research questions and discuss objectives from an academic point of view in the context of the following excerpt, expanding where possible in depth with academic language and detailed justification and discussion of purpose, relevance and context of each research question individually in detail:\nThe right to privacy and anonymity is a fundamental aspect of human rights discourse that has been recognized and debated for centuries. As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, the collection, storage, and sharing of personal information has become increasingly prevalent, making the protection of privacy and anonymity more important than ever before. The legal and philosophical foundations of privacy and anonymity as human rights have been shaped by historical and societal developments, and have been recognized in numerous legal documents and constitutional amendments.\n\nThis research document aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the legal and philosophical arguments for privacy and anonymity as human rights. Through a mixed-methods research design, the document will explore the historical evolution of privacy and anonymity as legal and philosophical concepts, and will examine the legal foundations of privacy and anonymity in international human rights instruments and national constitutional protections. The document will also analyze the philosophical underpinnings of privacy and autonomy, focusing on the works of key philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and Michel Foucault.\n    • Overview of the research design and methodology\nChapter 2: Legal foundations of privacy and anonymity\n    • Historical evolution of privacy as a legal concept\n    • Recognition of privacy as a human right in international human rights instruments\n    • Analysis of the ways in which legal foundations have evolved in response to technological advancements and changing societal norms\nChapter 3: Philosophical underpinnings of privacy and autonomy\n    • Analysis of the works of key philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and Michel Foucault\n    • Examination of how these philosophers have conceptualized privacy and autonomy\n    • Analysis of how their ideas have influenced the discourse on privacy and autonomy as human rights\nChapter 4: Impact of technology on privacy and anonymity\n    • Examination of the specific ways in which technology has impacted privacy and anonymity in recent years\n    • Analysis of the implications of these developments for the protection of individuals from surveillance and data collection, safeguarding freedom of expression, political participation, and promoting human dignity and equality\nChapter 5: Counterarguments and objections\n    • Analysis of counterarguments and potential objections to the thesis that privacy and anonymity should be considered human rights\n    • Examination of how these objections have been addressed in the literature\n    • Analysis of the responses to these objections\nChapter 6: Conclusion\n    • Summary of key findings and conclusions\n    • Implications of the research for privacy and anonymity as human rights\n    • Suggestions for future research in this field.\nBibliography &amp; Sources\n\n\nnote: I have no clue what I am doing lol, forgive my grammar/spelling/lack of knowledge/ inaccuracies etc and gimme some pointers",

Trying to 'cure' autism solely through biomedical means is then impossible, but I wouldn't say it's logically or nomologically impossible (because it's not about what's physically possible because it concerns the mental).",

We're covering [truth tables](https://i.imgur.com/sroYdfH.jpeg) and the ones for negation, conjunction and disjunction make perfect sense to me but I'm confused about the truth tables for material conditional/biconditional.\n\nFrom what I understand \"⊃\" is basically shorthand for \"if... then...\" and \"≡\" is basically shorthand for \"if and only if\". The truth tables for them kind of make sense but they're in no way intuitive to me and I definitely wouldn't have figured them out on my own without looking at the answers. Could someone please explain how if P is False and Q is True the end result is somehow True for the \"⊃\" truth table because that's a head scratcher.\n\nAlso is it \"P if and only if Q\" or \"Q if and only if P\"? I'm not sure what the dependent and independent variables are in this truth table.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nAbdurazak.",

        "text": "To get the first thing out of the way, the mirror test is highly flawed. Most animals do not rely on their sense of sight to recognize things, so recognizing themselves from a reflection isn't going to be a task that they can successfully complete. It is quite obvious that they use other means of recognizing themselves, such as their scent or songs. For example, cats are thought to completely lack self awareness because they fail the mirror test miserably, however cats do not rely on their sense of sight to recognize things. They can, however, recognize their own scent.\n\nThe ability to think is seen as a factor of self awareness.\n\nIf animals are not self aware, then how can they do highly complex things that requires a lot of thinking and planning? From a spider building a web that is designed almost perfectly for its purpose, using information from its surroundings, and gerbils building underground tunnel systems that requires a lot of thought and planning to lionesses stalking prey and communicating to not only plan but also carry out an improvised attack and wolves essentially doing the same thing. This all requires very complex planning, thought and the ability to perform actions out of their own will in order to be carried out successfully, which these creatures do to near perfection nearly every time. The ability to do something out of your own will rather than based on instinct is also seen as a factor of self awareness.\n\nSo if animals *can* recognize themselves through other means, and they *can* perform complex tasks that requires thought, planning and the ability to make choices/perform actions out of their own will, then what suggests that they lack self awareness? They are conscious, and all of the above, so prove me wrong.",

Would you perceive it as ethical and humane to end this animals suffering with your own hands? Could you do it, would you, and WHY would you? I’ve gotten into an argument about this in the past with a significant other during a discussion of a deer that was hit that was sure to die and was suffering greatly, in which I claimed that I would end its life to decrease it’s time spent in that state. They were not ethically receptive of this, even going as far as to call me disgusting, and monstrous for even having such a disposition or thoughts. I can’t help but feel judged and like I may be wrong in my thoughts on this. What branches of philosophy dictate these types of thought experiments and decisions?

        "text": "The objectivity of morality is often questioned here, and I think rightly so. In my opinion, it is not possible to determine objectively whether something is right or wrong, but whether something leads to human well-being or human suffering. (Alex O'Connor also thinks along these lines) \n\nAccording to many scientists, human well-being is quite objective to determine: There are five main aspects of personal health: physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual. In order to be considered \"well,\" it is imperative for none of these areas to be neglected. \n\nBut Alex O'Connor brings the notion of pleasure in. According to him, well-being is defined as maximizing pleasure. This is where it gets interesting because I think there is (just as elsewhere in the animal kingdom) a lot of 'destructive desire' among humans. There are psychopaths who like to kill or rape and a lot of other people who at least have some attraction to violence or sexual violence. \n\nIt seems to me that it is just a matter of preference and that people with destructive desires just don't care about the suffering of other people. \n\nBut then the argument can be made that although these people follow their destructive desires, they undermine their own well-being. For example, people who kill for pleasure will not be able to feel love. If these people could be convinced rationally that their well-being is under pressure they could be enlightened and change their behaviour. \n\nSo my question is: Is there a case to be made (and can it be proven) that well-being is objective? That could solve a lot of destructive behaviour.",
