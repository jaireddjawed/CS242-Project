Here are some of the things he thinks and says:\n\n\n. Thinks the Muslim world has problems because of high rates of incest which causes Muslims to be stupid and violent \n\n. Thinks the prymids of giza were actually power plants and that the ancient Egyptians had light bulbs\n\n. Former military, has girlfriend 30 years his junior\n\n. Thinks Trump is a literal genius and didn't care when MLK was assassinated because, \"it didn't effect me, so why would I care?\"\n\n. Extremely suspicious of Vietnamese people and seemingly dislikes vietnamese culture, yet still lives in vietnam\n\n. Yelled and berated significantly lower paid Vietnamese teachers because he was white and therefore he's better\n\n. Immigrate to America, hates non white immigrants\n\n\nI could on but this should give you an idea of the kinda person I had to put up with. There was a post a couple days ago about  expats and for those who are unaware or didn't see it a lot white expats are straight up parasites.",
