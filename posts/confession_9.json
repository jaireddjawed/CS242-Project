        "text": "I want to share my story with you, a story that has been a major part of my life for the past few years. I have been battling dental problems for as long as I can remember, and unfortunately, it cost me my teeth and mental sanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had been experiencing severe dental pain for years, but I kept ignoring it, thinking it would go away on its own. However, I was wrong. The pain worsened, and I started to lose my teeth. Not only did it affect my oral health, but it also started to take a toll on my mental well-being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became increasingly anxious, depressed, and isolated from the world around me. I stopped smiling, stopped eating my favorite foods, and avoided socializing. My life became a living nightmare, and I didn't know how to break free from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until I started seeking help that I realized the extent of the damage. I had to spend years and a lot of money to bring my oral condition to an acceptable state. And even though I am finally able to smile and eat with confidence, I can't help but think about the years of pain and suffering that I had to endure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut instead of dwelling on the past, I decided to use my experience to make a difference. I turned my back against my family and started using technology to make preventative oral care free. I want to ensure that no one has to go through the same pain and suffering that I had to endure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough my work, I have been able to help countless people prevent dental problems and maintain good oral health. It has given me a sense of purpose and fulfillment that I never thought was possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I want to encourage everyone to take their oral health seriously. Don't ignore dental pain or discomfort, as it can lead to severe problems that could cost you your teeth and mental well-being. And to those who have suffered the same fate as I did, know that you're not alone, and there is always hope for a better future.",

So the first few times this happened i tought \"oh well it is what it is\", but after some time i noticed that these pants are \"unlucky\". So i decided to test that today, i went to work in them (i work as a barman) when i got to work i told my co-workers that i have my unlucky pants on today, they laughed it off at first. Well i broke 3 glasses in the span of 10 minutes, broke a vodka bottle while trying to open it and while i was trying to clean my glasses they fucking snapped in half, but that is not the worst part. After my glasses snapped in half i was like \"okay this is a easy fix\" so i got some super glue and tried to glue them together, that did not go too well and i ended up with super glue on my lenses. That shit is not coming off. Now im sitting at work, blind as shit and my co-workers laughing at me. Needless to say im never wearing these pants ever again.",

The real reason why we are seeing this growth in price is because our exports of Ag products were cheap and we supplied a good portion to China, Russia, Europe, and Africa. Well our biggest competitor (Ukraine) is right now in a war and is not planting the fields useable for fear the crops might get damaged by the war. Well we actually are now holding crop insurance and other subsidies against farmers if they don‚Äôt waste the product to jack up prices. Since the US are once again the only main provider of most food sources we now are taking advantage of that tariff and business wise by telling farmers to destroy product they stored in excess supply in order to make more money by creating a false shortage until the war is over, Ukraine can start their production again, and we have sapped the last cent out of China(all experts point to this decade being the last the CCP will be able to survive). There is actually no real shortage in anything it a fiction created to maximum gain of the dollar gain because of the crisis.",

Long story short, she didn‚Äôt but this bothered her and somehow she put it together it was me (no concrete proof cause of #). She called to end things saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúabusive‚Äù ‚Äúshe knows it‚Äôs me‚Äù and still cares about me but we can‚Äôt be together. I deny this but we go our separate ways.

I‚Äôll say that I was brought up with a mother with borderline personality disorder and substance abuse issues who would often switch between saying I was the only reason she was alive to saying I‚Äôd ruined her life and that she wished I was dead. She would often let her partners bash the fuck out of me, I actually have a fractured skull from the constant hits to the back of my head. My father was emotionally absent and regardless of how afraid I was or how much I‚Äôd beg and cry he‚Äôd keep taking me back to her, every damn weekend. Until the age of twelve when my mother claimed I was demonically possessed and couldn‚Äôt put up with me anymore. My nan told me a few years ago even as a baby my mother would scream at me and leave me to cry for hours. Anywho back to the first bit i remember I use to genuinely look forward to being molested by my cousin, it‚Äôd happen every school holiday whenever I was at my nans and it honestly went on until I was fifteen. It actually makes me feel so ashamed, at the time it felt like we had a special bond and a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù. As an adult I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD along with a variety of anxiety disorders and also depression, I have really bad intimacy issues and will often only get with people I deep down know that I‚Äôll never care about. I can‚Äôt ever see myself being happy in a relationship because of how afraid I become when I do get with someone I genuinely do care for. Everything just feels better when I‚Äôm not invested and I don‚Äôt know how to change that.",

I was so irritated that others were joining in too instead of taking my side.\n\nSo I went to the physics lab's room where the lab assistant keeps the final copy of all our practical experiments. To my astonishment , that day, the room was empty , the stuff went outside as it was tiffin time. I just went and started looking for that classmate's exp.-book. All the papers were bundled in a rope so I just went with the flow and carried those 2 huge bundles of papers and got out of the room.\n\nI felt like a gangster that day. Let me explain, classs 11 to 12 , 2 years , more than 15 physics practical exams , so their details , how exp. was done , data ..............all infos were written in those pages. Students have to submit them to pass college at the end of 2nd year.\n\nI just took the bundles , went to the place where the college's manual laborers burn the cut out grass of the fields (campus is quite big so college authority employs people to do manual tasks). I felt like God is helping me to take revenge. There was nobody in the fire place. \n\nI just went , threw those 2 bundles and started whistling .\n\nThat day I understood what it means : Nero fiddles while Rome burns.\n\nTill this day , nobody found out how one day those practical exam sheets got vanished. We had to , including me , redo all those practical exams within 2 weeks. It made our life hell. Writing pages after pages for each exp. It takes 30min avg. to collect data as no. of instruments is small in the physics lab , 20\\~22 pages to write per exp. ; so yeah figure out yourself what a disaster I created.\n\nDo I repent ? Idk. But I'm sure if my classmates ever find out , they will , if they have to , dig me out of my grave.",

        "text": "So this was a year or so ago. Me and my grandfather use to be very close. During covid he had falling out because he would  constantly verbally abuse me, often times calling me fat and other things related to my weight. Anyways a few months after the fallout I got a birthday card with a check in it. I believe it was a 100 dollars but I really dont remember the exact amount. Anyways I got a lighter and a shitload of WD 40 and made like a flame thrower type thing and lit the card and check. Ive never told anyone about me lighting it on fire mainly because if I would have told my mom is because she would have been pissed and said well I couldve had the money. Anyways my grandfather who still keeps in touch with my mom asked if I ever got the card and I said no. I told my mom he can keep his money and I dont need it. Now I may have lost out on a 100 dollars but I atleast I still have my pride.",
