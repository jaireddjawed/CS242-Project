        "text": "Earlier I went to the grocery store to pick up a few things and when I entered the lot I spotted a good parking spot. When I got closer I realize the Mercedes that was parked on the right had its entire wheel in the spot, which is why no one else was parked there. They were parked next to a curb, so it's not like they parked like an ass because they \"had\" to. Usually when someone is over or on the line I just make sure I'm in the spot on the other side and get as close as I need to to the asshole parker, but after I backed in I realized there was no way to open my door. Our doors were less than 4 inches apart. So rather than move to another spot, I decide to wait.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I see the lights on the rearview blink and the trunk pops open and I know it's about to go down. After the guy puts his groceries in the trunk he stands at his trunk and motions at me me \"Wtf?\" so I roll down my window\n\nMe: Yeah, what's up?\n\nDouche: Can I get in my car?\n\nM: You're over the line.\n\nD: So? I know I'm over the line. You just park like this to piss me off?\n\nM: You just park like this to be an asshole? You should park in the lines.\n\nD: I'm didn't park like this to be asshole, I was in a hurry. So can I get in my car?\n\nM: Yeah I was in a hurry too and I want to go get my groceries, but I can't. Why should I move just cause you park like an asshole? You got a passenger door.\n\nI let my window up and go back to my phone as he yells out \"Fine, I got all day!!\" and he goes around and gets in the backseat on the passenger side, and the waiting begins. I was thinking about just climbing over out of my passenger side and walking home, but about 8 minutes after our standoff started I see his left leg shoot in my line of sight, and hes climbing into the front seat from the backseat.\n\nD: Hey!\n\nM: What?\n\nD: I hope you had fun. \n\nM: Oh, I had a lot of fun. Next time maybe you'll park in the line.\n\nD: I had fun too!! I'm a driver, I got all day!\n\nThen he backs out and pulls in front of my car for a few minutes before finally driving off down the whole aisle, I decide I'll get groceries later and turn out in the opposite direction, so when he comes up to exit the lot I pass in front of him and he is piiiiiisssed.\n\ntl; dr. Car is parked in two spots and I park so close he can't open the door forcing him to get in through the passenger door. He wants to play chicken so we wait it out and when he finally leaves I leave too and pass by him before he can exit the lot.",

        "text": "This one is thanks to my amazing girlfriend (GF) and the ass (ASS) that sat next to me (ME) on our most recent flight. TLDR at bottom. \n\n\nWe were on a long international flight, GF was going to have a window seat and myself the middle. When we got to our seats though there was ASS, sitting in the window seat. I asked if he could check his ticket and he moved to the aisle albeit begrudgingly, and a dramatic effort to move his bag from under the seat.\n\n\nWhen the flight attendants came past she asked him to move his bag to the over head, because it didn't fit under the seat properly. I took the benefit of the doubt when his bag hit me in the head... twice. \n\n\nASS tried to shove his bag in the space that was left in the overhead and a bunch of stuff fell out of one of the pockets. Some things landed on me and his seat, mostly paper and wrappers. As I moved them off me and added them to the pile, he snapped at me to not touch his stuff. \n\n\nSo needless to say it wasn't the best start to a flight, especially knowing we were stuck together for the next 10 hours. Nothing to deserve petty revenge yet, but I wanted to give you an idea of what ASS was like. \n\n\nWell were a few hours in and GF is fast asleep, I'm watching movies and the dinner service is about to start. My GF is unlucky to be lactose intolerant, not bad but she'll need the toilet a lot the few hours after eating milk products. Lucky for her on flights this means she gets her food before everybody else. \n\n\nMy GF and ME have an agreement not to wake the other up for food on these flights, as sleep &gt; food. The flight attendant delivers the food and I accept it for her, then ask ASS if he minds letting me out to use the toilet. He's clearly annoyed by this. I normally find this is perfect timing because once the full trolley service starts, getting to the toilet or back to your seat is a pain, and the line for the toilets is always short just before food service. I leave GF's food on my tray for if she wakes up, and go to the toilet. \n\n\nI'm gone for a couple minutes and when I get back I can't believe what I see. ASS is filling his mouth with GF's food.\n\n\nME: What the hell mate, that's my girlfriends food. \n\n\nASS: Well she wasn't eating it, besides allergies are all in the head.  \n\n\nME: You're a f***ing ass.\n\n\nGF wakes up and people start looking, can't blame them it's in-flight entertainment and I'd look too.\n\n\nGF: What's going on. \n\n\nME: This d**k is eating your food. \n\n\nThere was then a bunch of name calling from both sides and few people around us chime in too. A flight attendant rushed over and was able to calm everybody down. She makes ASS get up so I can sit back down. My GF with a cool head asks the attendant to check if there are any options she can have and that \"may contain or processed in a facility with milk\" is fine. \n\n\nASS looks like he's enjoyed my GF's meal and the flight attendant offers GF the chicken which  comes with a dessert that may contain milk. \n\n\nTime for the petty revenge.\n\n\nThe moment my food hit my tray, GF sneakily grabbed the cheese packet and ate it with the the biggest smile on her face. 20 minutes later she was asking if ME and ASS to get up.\n\n\nShe comes back. 10 minutes later she asks us to get up again. \n\n\nShe comes back, and the process repeats again.\n\n\nASS eventually snapped and said he wouldn't get up again. GF asks if they could swap seats. ASS seams to have forgotten our first interaction was he didn't want to give up his stolen window seat. He refuses to swap seats and tells her to \"f**k off\".\n\n\nASS is living up to his name and continues to refuse to move. People are telling him to get up and the flight attendant comes over. Just so happens to be the same one from earlier.  We explain the situation and GF bluffs that it must have been the dessert forgetting to mention the cheese she stole from me. \n\n\nThe flight attendant offers to move ASS and he accepts with a shit eating grin on his face. GF goes to the toilet and I enjoy some extra leg room. When GF gets back she looks a bit too happy. She went on to explain that when she came out of the toilet she saw ASS again. He had an aisle seat right next to the toilet. I hope he thought eating my GF's dinner was worth the annoying toilet light, flushing, smell, and people constantly standing inline next to you. \n\n\nTLDR girlfriend poisons herself with milk to wage biological warfare on a asshole that ate her allergy free meal.\n\nEdit: some spelling mistakes. \n\nEdit 2: I want also add that I like to think the flight attendant was also taking some petty revenge for ASS making her job hard.

        "text": "Back story: I am divorced, and for the first few summers after the divorce, my kids would spend two months with their father and step-mother.  As of a couple of summers ago, I put a complete stop to the summers and filed to end all visitation - unless supervised - because apparently my ex has NO CLUE about boundaries and what is and isn't appropriate to do with your wife in a hotel room with three kids - aged 12, 10, and 8. (You can use your imagination from here.)\n\nSo, fast forward to this summer, and my ex-in-laws asked if they could take my kids on vacation for a week or two.  They did nothing wrong, so I was happy to let them go - on the condition their father was not involved.  They agreed, we finalized the plans, the vacation comes and everything is going well.  \n\nWhile the kids were gone, my guy and I decided to go on vacation as well.  Unfortunately, while we were on our vacation, our dog passed away. (Wasn't entirely unexpected - she was having heart and lung issues and the stress of the trip was just too much. She had a heart attack and passed in my arms while we were driving through a severe thunderstorm/tornado and couldn't pull over.) We were having a really hard time, cut our vacation short, and we ended up getting a new puppy a few days later - an 8 week old Jack Russell Terrier.\n\nAt the end of the kids' time with their grandparents, my son started texting me saying he was getting extremely frustrated with his grandparents because they kept asking why he wouldn't just forgive his dad and visit him and how his dad loves him so much and just doesn't understand why the kids won't talk to him.  Now, since I had put a halt to the visits, my ex had not once, in any way, shape or form, attempted to contact his children.  He has a home phone number and address.  4 birthdays, 2 Christmases, and multiple other occasions to reach out, and not a single peep.\n\nMy son was cool with it at first, knowing there was no way his dad had told his parents the truth, and he didn't want to make waves. My daughter was so happy to see her grandparents that she wanted to stay with them a little longer. They called me and asked if they could buy my daughter a ticket to fly home with them and go to a couple of family weddings.  They knew the rule was that the kids are to stay away from their dad, so I reiterated she could go on the condition that her dad was not involved.  They said it was cool, they understood and ex would 100% not be involved.\n\nFinally, on the drive home from the airport, my son had been guilted enough and finally went off.  He told them everything.  He left nothing to the imagination.  He then went off about his dad not even trying to contact them and basically told them the truth about every single lie they were told. He then texted me and let me know that they were lying and his father WOULD be at the second wedding. I immediately called them and said NO WAY! and that she was not going with them. But, I didn't lose my temper. No point.  They'll just be told no if they ask to take the kids again. That's worse than yelling at them.  My ex is an only child and these are the only biological grandkids.\n\nOf course, before he finally lost it, he checked with me to make sure I would have his back, which, of course I did.  He then texted me during the whole conversation with them.  Suddenly, it wasn't \"your mom just doesn't like \"step-mom\" so she's making you want to hate your dad\" blah blah blah.  Nope, now it's \"we knew your mom wouldn't keep you away without a good reason!\" \"Your mom is a great mom and we always thought she was the best!\" blah blah blah\n\nThe pettiness: My ex-mother-in-law absolutely LOVES animals.  She goes to the pet store just to socialize with the pets people bring in.  Just a picture of a cute puppy or kitten can reduce her to tears.  She's mush when it comes to any baby animal.\n\nI go out to the driveway to meet them as they pull in to drop off the kids.  My ex-MIL knows about the puppy because I posted her on FB after we got her.  (Just to make sure you can picture this pup, she is white with brown on her head and one spot on her tiny tail and she weighs a very wiggly 2.5 pounds.  She's tiny and adorable.) \n\nI wait until the kids have all of their things gathered and inside the house, and wait for my ex-in-laws to get in the car and just as they start the car, I walk outside with the puppy.  She's so excited and wiggling all over my daughter and my ex-MIL opens her window and says \"she's so cute!\" and looks at me expecting me to pick her up and bring her over to the car.  I just look at her and say \"aw, thanks! Have a safe flight!\" and I watch her face fall as I pick up the puppy and walk back into the house with my daughter.\n\nTL;DR: Ex loses visitation and lies to his family about it. Ex-in-laws ask to see kids and proceed to try to guilt them into contacting their dad back and lie to me. I refuse to let ex-MIL pet adorable new puppy.",

        "text": "Okay, so I posted this in response to someone else's comments and it was suggested that I post it here. Here goes.\n\nWhen I was a kid, we lived on the 2nd story of a two story condominium in Wisconsin. It had a shared lawn with an apartment complex..the layout was like this l  \\_ l the lines being the buildings, the center being a lawn. The far left building was an apartment complex that had it's own strip of lawn but nobody really complained when people would walk their dogs on ours. There was a woman from the apartment complex that would never take her dog out on a leash OR pick up the poop, to add to it, she would SHRIEK the dog's name to try to call him back. Apparently he wanted to be as far away from the woman as well. She would take her dog out in the middle of the night, early morning, daytime..didn't matter, and she would yell \"JAAAAAAKE!' over and over while leaving huge Labrador dumps in our yard. My step-dad tried asking her nicely several times to leash her dog, stop yelling and pick up the poos, she said okay but then ignored him (my mom worked nights as a nurse and he worked varying shifts as a maintenance mechanic so this lady disturbed my mom ALOT). He then started simply telling her to \"shut the fuck up\" out of his bedroom window...that didn't work. Finally, one morning in the winter of Wisconsin, my old man had enough. She woke him up with her screams at the dog, so he waited and watched for the dog to finish pooping and for her to go inside, he then ran outside, picked up the huge dump and took it over to her car and wiped it underneath her door handle and inside her intake vents, so that when she started up her car and kicked the heat on high she would get a fresh blast of dog poop. The best thing is, even if she turned off the heat she would 1. be cold as hell and 2. still get the scent from the vents. Unfortunately, he didn't get to witness the aftermath BUT she stopped taking her dog into our yard and we never heard her shrieks again. We did get to watch her come home drunk with some dude one night, throw up all over the place and then proceed to make out with the guy. She was a classy lady.",

        "text": "I always just lurk this thread as well as petty revenge.  However I’m at a point in my life where I feel like I can share my experience, and hope you can get some satisfaction from them.\n\nI used to serve in the United States Air Force working in ground transportation.  To close the gap I won’t use military acronyms or ranks.  \n\nThis is kind of a long read.  \n\nThis Jewel takes place when I worked nights as a dispatcher.  My primary job was to support base operations man power and vehicles.  Apart of that was renting vehicles to flight crews.  \n\nWe had about 30 vehicles we could give air crews to rent. There is an online forum you can fill out or call us directly.  This lets you see what we have available. However sometimes we don’t have any vehicles for them to use and they have to just deal with being dropped off and picked up. Basically they can’t travel around the city on the governments dime.  \n\nIt’s a normal quiet night liken most.  I get a call giving me information on a plane about to land.  Ok no problem I dispatch a driver and the proper vehicle to pick them up.  Instead of the driver taking them directly to the hotel he comes back to the shop.  I’m confused as it’s made clear we have nothing to lend the crew and they have to be taken to the hotel directly.  \n\nIn comes this lets call him Jim.  Now Jim has a high rank as high as you could consider someone of upper management one rank from being a general. He walks up to me with an angry look demanding that he receive a vehicle for him and his crew.  \n\nI asked to see his request form.  Jim looks at me as if I have just insulted his honor.  “I DON’T NEED PAPER WORK,  you will give me what I want or there will be problems. “  I just want to make something clear most people I run into are very very civil.  Sometimes though you get Jim.  Jim likes to use his position to get what he wants and to threaten others if he doesn’t.  \n\n“Ok Jim this isn’t how it works there are procedures and regulations I have to abide by if you don’t have the request then I can’t help you.” He snorts literally snorts his nose puckers up and I thought he was going to shoot snot at me.  \n\n“Give me the paper work to fill out then damnit!!”   Jim at this point is trying to posture over me as much as he can to make himself appear more threatening.  \n\nI hand him the paper work and watch him fill it out.  As soon as he hands it back to me without missing a beat I look at him and say.  “I’m sorry sir but we bony have any vehicles at this time to give you.  If you don’t mind I can get my guy to take you to your hotel and we will pick you up tomorrow morning.”  Honestly my smile at this point was clearly one of satisfaction and I was holding back laughter.  Took this guy 10 minutes to fill the paper work out.\n\nAt this point he is furious he starts yelling and screaming at me at the top of his lungs.  All the guys get out of there seats to come into the dispatch area but I wave them back into the lounge.  I let him yell for a solid 15 minutes. I honestly was impressed \n\nAfter he calms down a bit he leans over the counter might be about 6 inches between us and he says” Your mouth just wrote a check your rank can’t cash.”  \n\nSilence just fills the room.  After a few moments I say “Did you just reference top gun?”  He takes a step back and I’m not sure what was going through his head but I think he had a lot of miss fires at the moment.  \n\nHe begins to start up again telling me that I’m just an airmen and I have to respect the chain of command and that if he gives me an order I have to obey.  I’m not going to muck up the story with explanation about chain of commands. At this point I had enough. \n\nI stood up”Sir I understand your frustration but I run this shop, I am the dispatcher and what I say goes.  I have told you we can’t give you a vehicle and stated the alternatives.  If you continue to cause me problems I will call the police who will be happy to escort you from this building, and tomorrow you can explain to the boss why you felt the need to scream and shout for the sake of a vehicle.  This is what’s going to happen you are going to get onto that bus and one of my guys will take you and what is very obviously a tired crew to the hotel.  What is it going to be?”  \n\nHe was stunned and his posture changed instantly.  He looks back at the crew who at this point have turned their heads away as if pretending not to hear.  \n\nI sit back down in front of the computer slide the paper work and information he gave me. I look down at my rank and back at him and said”Check cashed.”\n\n\nGist: Man names Jim tries to abuse his power while referring to top gun. Only to be shot down in the same way. \n\nEdit:spelling\n\n\n\nSome are asking if I got into trouble.  I didn’t my commander found the story hilarious and left it at that.  ",

        "text": "TLDR: No thank you, you’ll just have to spend the whole 3 minutes to read, but hopefully you’ll enjoy. \n\nMy wife and I attended the Juke Box Heroes tour at the amphitheater venue in our area yesterday. I’m not usually petty or revengeful, but yesterday was just a “perfect storm” of dysfunction for me so I was primed and ready. I was tired, had two knees that were excruciatingly painful because they were due for cortisone injections (done today thank you). To top it all off the venue owners (think opposite of “Dead Country”) had closed the grass section of the amphitheater, forcing us from our position of comfort laying on our concert blanket, stretching our legs, etc and into their cramped uncomfortable stadium style seats. So anyhow...\n\nBy the time the main act came to the stage we had sat through the first act, that we didn’t care about, and the second act that we disliked. We had to come for the whole show because of the change in seating and had to exchange our seats early. We couldn’t come later for just our band, oh well that’s life. \n\nThat’s the setup, now for the guy sitting next to me, we’ll call him Phone Douche (PD) because well, that’s what he was being. I know many people are recording parts of the concert. Phones are out everywhere, including my wife’s on my other side. The difference is that most folks were being decent about it, if not courteous. Not PD, no he’s taking Panoramic shots. You know the ones where you have to stick your arm out and pan around you. Your big hairy, in a white tank top arm. Hairy arm that you have to stick in my face to start your photo with on the left. During the first two acts I didn’t worry about, didn’t say anything because I really didn’t care. \n\nWhen the main act came out I politely asked if he could please not stick his (hairy) arm in my face. I explained a second time that it was really annoying and I had refrained from imposing all night. He didn’t care, just kept it up. \n\nWell finally I’d had enough. I decided to do what people at live concerts do, sing along with the band. You need to realize that I am not musically inclined in the slightest. That didn’t stop me from enthusiastically singing very loudly, directly into is phone when it was in my face. I would love to be there when he shares his masterpiece recordings on Social Media. Some classics included  “You’re as old as vice,  willing to crack the ice”,  “Well, I'm snot flooded, check it and see, got a fever of a hundred bees.” I think my favorites were probably  “Feels like the third time” and “Juke Box Zero, got cars in his thighs”,  My wife even leaned over and whispered in my ear “what’s wrong with you, you’re singing the wrong words.” Oh yes I am baby, yes I am!\n\n",

The pay was good, and all I had  do was drive in a little circle on our small campus for a couple of hours. Generally the people who rode the bus were all fine, it was those who didn't who were the problem.\n\nOne apartment complex parking lot where I picked up passengers was horribly designed. I only had a small circle of space to pull in, drive around to pick people up, and pull out. At the end of the lot there was a space clearly marked no parking, and without fail there was always some jerks parked there on my shift. I couldn't always see them in time and would have to back out and do a seven point turn to get out of the lot. \n\nThe thing is, I worked the early shift. 7-9 am, where most people are still asleep. When I had to back up the bus it was nice and loud. So whenever people made it difficult for me to do my job, everyone in that apartment complex got an early morning wakeup call. ",

She’s an alcoholic who has stolen various things from me (think things like my debit card or social security number), but given she’s the only family I have within a 12 hour radius, I live with her because I’m not even 20 and my part time job prevents me from being able to afford anything. \n\nSo this time last year she promises me that she’s going to give me her car when she’s finished paying it off in 2019. I’m stoked because it’s a fairly nice car. But as time goes on, and after one large fight she and I had last month, she decides that I no longer get to have her car. I’m pissed, if I had known I wasn’t getting her car, I would have been saving up for one this whole time! So she’s completely screwed me at this point; but a few weeks later when the turbulence settles, instead of saying I can have it, she tells me I can ‘borrow’ it, but refuses to let me use it for long periods of time. This is where the plan hatches. \n\nSince she’s started letting me use her car, I’ve done nothing but drive it for as long as I’m allowed to. I don’t even stop and go anywhere, I just get on the highway and book it. I’m racking up the miles and tearing up the engine as much as I possibly can every single day so reselling it will be that much more difficult when the time comes to do so. \n\nShe has no idea I’ve been doing this because I’ll put some gas in it before I get it back to her, it looks like I drove way less than I actually did.

My cousin listens to some really bad mumble rap. On top of that, he likes to play his music when she drives him and his friends around town. One day, she got so sick of his music that she hatched a nefarious plan. \n\nSince my cousin loves his music so much, my aunt figured that he wouldn’t mind if a diehard fan decided to rap along with the filth coming through the car stereo. She slowly learned the lyrics to a bunch of his songs and waited for her time to strike. \n\nThe day came where my cousin and his friends needed a ride that lasted longer than normal (~30 min as opposed to the usual 10-15 min). My aunt warmed up her angelic voice and flawlessly rapped every tune that my cousin put on the stereo. The misogynistic melodies flowed from her motherly mouth so well that Lil Wayne would’ve spilled his lean in disbelief. When my embarrassed cousin scrambled to change the song, she used the steering wheel controls to start the song over thereby putting him and his friends right back at square one. \n\nNeedless to say, my cousin played some more friendly music in the car from that moment on.

We order our food, and when the waiter leaves she pulls it out again clearly texting.  Being someone who doesn’t like to have a misunderstanding I tell her that I don’t like the fact that she is on her phone.\nShe apologizes and says she won’t do it again. \n\nOk fine glad I said something about it and I relax.  The food comes and everything is seems to be going well... except that her phone is on vibrate and she has it on the table.  It’s going off every 5 seconds. It almost sounded like she was getting called.  \n\nI asked her if she could put the phone in her purse as it’s distracting.  She gives me this smug look and said “You should just be happy I’m willing to be here with you.”  Ok well that’s just mean I think to myself.  After her comment she instantly picks up her phone and begins to text.  \n\nI ask what is so important that she has to text so much.  She told me that she plans to go out after this dinner with some friends to a club. \n\nI’m taken back by this considering I had tickets to see a movie, and it hits me.  She was just here to get a free meal.\n\nI tell her I need to use the rest room.  I find our server and tell him that I need the bill and it’s separate.

        "text": "So to set the scene I work in a failing restaurant. People are jumping ship left and right and I'm one of them. Or trying to be. I'm a cook and the last \"good\" one left.  In total there are 4 cooks left. \n\nSo before so many jumped ship I was working a morning shift with a cook who I will call R for this instance. \n\nWell R , to give some idea of the type of person she is. She's a very short, angry person that can't do her job  and apparently shits nice smelling flowers. \n\nShe likes to cook on the egg station but can't due to needing someone to hold her hand. (Call every order of eggs). I refuse to do so since she refused to do anything else. I'm running around the kitchen cooking everything from pancakes to steaks while she sits on eggs and misses every other order. I simply don't have time to call them to her and run the rest of the kitchen. To top it off, when a customer complains about said eggs she yells at the server who asked for a remake. Overall she is a bitch to everyone and refuses to do anything beisdes eggs. She does so and leaves. \n\nWell finally that shift ended for her and she was on her way out. She hasnt done any cleaning, any stocking, absolutely nothing. So I politely ask \n\n\"Hey R can you please change the trash out before you leave?\" \n\nAnd she replies yelling ,\n\n\"You see this is why we don't work well together. You don't cut my paycheck and I don't need no KID to tell me how to do my job!\" \n\nShe yelled other stuff but it's not important and mostly random babbling. \n\nWell to start. I am young. I'm younger than the majority of cooks in a restaurant and definitely younger than most for a cook lead position. But I do not take kindly to people pulling an age card especially when I have more experience, in a leadership position and definitely not from someone who can't do a simple task. Give respect get respect. \n\nSo fast forward to the present. I'm moved to night shift due to a cook unable to do so anymore and others leaving. And I happen to see on the schedule that R is the morning cook. \n\nThus begins my revenge. I clean the required places. But oops. I forgot to change the trash, stock the line or brick the grill. So she walks in with nothing on the line, trash overflowing and the icing on the cake, a party of 24 walked in as I walked out. \n\nShe seen this and before I left yelled again saying x and x Is supposed to be done. And that I need to stay and help with the party. \n\n\nMy reply \n\n\"I'm sorry you don't cut my check. And I dont need some little bitch telling me how to do my job.\"  And I walked out and went home. \n\nEdit: damn this blew up! My highest rated post is about me getting revenge on a idiot coworker. \n\nEdit: for those interested in the aftermath\n\n\nI come in for night shift again and hear from a coworker that she got slammed. It was a mess but got cleaned quickly since it wasn't busy the rest of the day. \n\nMy manager pulled me into the office and asked what happened since I never left the line before without that happening. I truthfully explained the situation. I got a slap in the wrist and had a good laugh about it. From now on the manager is going to keep a closer eye on her. The next time she screams at a server she's fired since we hired a few new people. And can afford to replace her. \n\nSo all in all I got my revenge , and manager that also wants her gone is looking for the reason to put on the paperwork. ",

        "text": "Hi y'all, I've long been a lurker and this is my first post on reddit ever, so my apologies if I don't get all of the rules and acronyms down, and I hope this is the right place to post this!\n\nI've been going through some shit with a greedy litigious neighbor who basically instigated my corgi to nip at her son, and now is trying (somewhat successfully) to sue my insurance for $40,000 (btw his medical bills were... the amount of an office visit). But thats a story for another time (or the RevengeIdeas subreddit, lol). The frustration of this has made me become, well, a JusticePorn, PettyRevenge and ProRevenge addict. And so, I've been thinking about the karmic justice in my own life, and I realized that I have a good story of my own! Here goes.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was about 6, and my mom dated a few men, before meeting someone... who I shall call \"Bob\"... They met when I was around 10, dated for a couple years, and then got married. Now, \"Bob\" was nice to me at first, but he quickly showed what an narcissistic psychopathic ass-douche he was. He would do things like count how many squares of toilet paper I used, and then yell at me for using too many. He would time my showers. He would yell at me to be considerate and keep the window open when showering (to let the steam out), then yell at me for being inconsiderate enough to have the window open when showering, because some family friends came over and caught a glimpse of my bare belly through the window. He (and my mom) would only let me drink juice as a dessert. Water is a beverage. Juice is a dessert. He criticized and berated me for things like \"making mouth noises while eating\" (mind you, not chewing with my mouth open, or making loud smacking noises, but just the tiniest of noises would set him off). He was cranky, snarky, critical, and always saying things to make me feel like I was worthless. Everything that went wrong around the house was my fault. Everything that I did was wrong and dumb and bad and disgusting and inconsiderate. And also, I was an ungrateful tramp who should be thankful that I had a place to live, dessert to drink, and that they had taught me how to take the bus so that I could get around by myself.... Anyways, I could go on. But long story short, somehow he had a special type of meanness that was  reserved just for me. As an adolescent girl, this led to me having very low self-esteem, contemplating suicide often, almost dropping out of school, running away several times, etc.\n\nNow, my mom was mostly on his side, but when she wasn't, she was pretty much complacent with what he did and said. She kept trying to justify everything and blame it on my actions. I admit, yes, I was an adolescent teenager and was not completely perfect. But she was completely blind to his craziness. And nobody else realized what a piece of cockcheese \"Bob\" truly was. My grandparents, my aunts, uncles, etc. all thought Bob was \"super-dad\" (literally, in my grandmas own words).\n\nIt's funny, my mom always told me \"You need to have your own career, never depend on a man\" but yet, when I went off to college, she left her job to become a housewife and focus on her hobbies, knowing that she would be supported by \"Bob\", who was having great success and wealth with the software company he had started. Oh, also... in spite of his wealth and the Tesla he was driving, and the multiple iPhones and MacBooks that were all around the house, somehow it was important for me to 100% pay for myself and support myself, as soon as I moved out. When I came back home from college for the summers, I wasn't allowed to stay at our house (because I needed to be \"independent\"). If I ate food from the kitchen while I was hanging out at their house, I was expected to pay them back for groceries. I don't think Bob even got me a Christmas or birthday present after my 16th birthday.\n\nAnyways, fast forward 10 years or so (to \\~2017). I had completed a graduate degree, lived far away from my family, and didnt have to see my mom or \"Bob\" very often. When my fiancé and I did go back home, we preferred to stay in a hotel/motel, but yes, we would still buy groceries to pay back my mom and stepdad for the food that we ate while we were at their house. I generally avoided \"Bob\", and overall just made my peace with the fact that he's a fecalnugget but that he made my mom happy. However, I was still a bit resentful of all the fucked up shit that I had been through, and the fact that my mom continued to blame his behavior on me and my actions, without taking any accountability or giving any fault to him.\n\nWELL, last year, 2017... it all changed. My mom found out that \"Bob\" had been cheating on her for several months with his flight instructor (yes, he was taking pilot lessons as a hobby, and has since bought his own airplane, I'm told). She was a fugly, frumpy horse-tooth woman, but the funniest part, is that she is my age. Yep, she is the age of his own stepdaughter. \"Bob\" said he was still in love with my mom, but also loved \"Anne\". He strung my mom along for months, while she gave him a choice. Either leave \"Anne\" and go to marriage counseling, or get a divorce. \"Bob\" couldn't make his mind up after about a year, so my mom finally served him the divorce papers. On my birthday. As a present to me (I think?).\n\nMy mom finally realized what a boogerworm \"Bob\" was, and she has now admitted that she did see how cruel and awful he was to me. She regrets marrying him, and is now re-examining her life and her behaviors, actions, beliefs, etc. BOOM! Karma.\n\nNow, about \"Bob\" and \"Anne\".. rumor is that she may be pregnant, although the divorce is not finalized. While they haven't received their own justice yet, I know that someday they will. Maybe if I post a picture of their awful faces and expose them for the horrible people they are, that would be karma enough? Nahhhh.\n\nTL;DR: Mom marries narcissistic man who treats stepdaughter like shit... 20 years later mom gets cheated on and left by the man for a fugly woman the same age as their daughter. Mom regrets life decisions.",

This guy (Brent) seemed cool at first but within days showed himself to be very very strict.\n\nFor example, Alan only moved in a few suitcases and accidentally brushed part of the wall in his bedroom as he dropped one, leaving the tiniest mark (not even a scratch) on the molding.  The next day while Alan was at work, he got a text from Brent that the huge scratch on the wall was unacceptable and he would be taking a portion of the security deposit to repair.  The other fact we gleaned from this was that Brent went snooping in Alan’s room despite him closing the door.\n\nSome other rules were no guests ever for any reason, and no scents, which included no cooking, only using unscented laundry detergent and soap, etc.\n\nYesterday Alan asked me if I could drive them to the store because I live nearby and Alan’s car was getting fixed (Brent doesn’t drive).  I’d only met Brent once prior because of the no guests rule, but I live nearby so sure.\n\nHonestly just to see if it was as bad as Alan said, I unwrapped an old pack of strawberry car fresheners, stuck them on the dashboard, and left my car in the sun until the afternoon when I had to go pick them up.  When I got in the car it was boiling hot and strawberry scented air BURST out. It was even a little overpowering to me but it smelled so good.\n\nI picked them up and Alan immediately goes “wow it smells so good in here” and Brent visibly gags before getting in.  He literally plugged his nose for the 5 minute ride to the store but the air was so heavy with scent that he could probably taste it.\n\nI parked in the sun so I could enjoy Round 2 on the way home.",

It was adjacent to the busiest laundromat in town, and two doors down from a house with 7 or 8 college kids that all had their own cars (and no driveway for those cars). It was always a battle for a parking spot.\n\nMy building was on a corner that had about 6 feet of yellow curb where parking wasn't allowed, followed by about 14 or 15 feet of space before the driveway - where parking was legal. I usually got one of the two spots in that area, but sometimes things got interesting...\n\nOne night, I parked directly in front of the yellow curb in hopes that my girlfriend would be able to park in front of me later that night. Instead, one of the college kids parked there. Eventually, another college kid parked behind me in the illegal space - they both parked so close to me that it was nearly impossible to pull out. The following morning when I finally noticed, I was running late for work and didn't have time to go knock on their door and tell them to move their car(s), I ended up doing a 15 point turn (no exaggeration) to get out of that space. But I didn't want to let that be the end of it.\n\nI ended up calling the non emergency line for the police station, and told them about the car that was parked in the yellow curbed area. They slapped a ticket on his window. I wasn't there to see it, but my girlfriend told me that he eventually went out to his car and was swearing and yelling about the ticket. Sweet petty revenge. ",

        "text": "When I was young, our street had a lot of young kids. We would always hang out on the street, usually with a ball. \n\nA new kid moved in a few houses down, and we invited him outside early on. We realised very quickly that we started to lose balls. They would just vanish, and he’d turn up the next day with a ball pretty similar to it, to which he’d respond he had for years. It was clear he was a thief but we had no proof, because the balls were pretty common, and lots of kids had them. \n\nOne day my mate lost a brand new soccer ball worth like 40 bucks. A few days later we saw that kid again, and he had that ball. We asked him about it and he said he had just bought it. Later on, when we all went inside, I messaged my neighbour who had lost his ball to meet me outside. We jumped the fence of the kids house, snuck into his backyard and stole the ball back. \n\nWhen we got it back, we wrote the name of the original owner on the ball. The next day, when the thief came outside, we made sure he saw us playing with that ball. We played dumb. We acted really excited, showing him that we found our ball, and that we knew it was ours because our name was on it. When we asked him to bring his ball out, he said he didn’t know where it was. At this point it was a Mexican standoff. He knew that we were lying, because he did in fact steal the ball and there’s no way we found it anywhere else but his backyard, but he couldn’t mention it, because then he’d be admitting to his theft. We kinda just never talked after that. \n\nHe was pretty confused, we could see it in his face. A well executed plan. \n\nEdit; to everyone saying it’s a stolen repost... no. I’ve posted it before and it got taken down by prorevenge. \n\nEdit2: check my post history. I have a post on findareddit asking where a more suitable place to put this story would be, and someone suggested this. ",

        "text": "My brother and I fight a lot but this just might be the most petty I've gotten. My brother wouldn't quit complaining about me not doing anything and how I should do more chores around the house because I don't work, now I feel like I should say this I'm 19 he's 25 he left home already and moved back in with his wife and kid and said they needed a place to stay for a month or two that was five months ago.\n\nWe had no problem with the amount of work that was being distributed before he moved back in but I guess with our mom and his wife breathing down his neck he feels the need to deflect the blame. I don't like that. One day he got real pissy because mom asked him to mow and weed eat the yard about half way through he started complaining that I wasn't out there helping him. One I didn't know they were mowing the yard today and two if they had asked me I would have but instead of asking me he just complains to mom about how I do nothing so she comes into my room and tells me to weed eat I was a little confused because I didn't know why she seemed angry at me so she sees that and explains. I go outside and see my brother he's now avoiding eye contact and already weed eat half the yard I say \"Mom told me you wanted to show me how to weed eat\" so he says yeah and hands it to me. So I pick it up kinda quick it's not that hard I get about half way done with what's left and he says \"I'll get this side of the fence\" I said \"no I can do it\" and he responds with \"no I'm already on this side\" and he never gave it back. So he edges the whole side walk and I tried to take it back but he kinda just ignored me so this is what pissed me off not that he doesn't want me to do more things but the fact that he clearly wants me to not do this so he can complain. He finished edging the side walk and mom heaps the leaf blower to get rid of the grass he then takes it from her hand and says \"I've already done everything else I'm gonna do this to\" no in a angry way but like in a matter of fact way. \n\nThis is where I've decide I've had enough of his attitude so this is when I decided to spend four hours to find a program that worked to cut off his laptops wifi. Because the irony in all this is he doesn't do much he mainly sits in his room and plays fortnite all day. So now I have a program that let's me cut off the wifi to any device connected to our router. Now it's not really cutting off the wifi but is does do something that stop the information.\n\nTLDR: My brother wants to complain about me not doing anything when all he does is play fortnite.\n\nEdit:This isn't the only thing my brother has done and this is not the only thing I've done. This was just a kinda tipping point and this is also the most \"extream\" thing I've done to him\n\nAlso for anyone asking what program I used I'm gonna say I don't recommend it because it's shady af but it's called netcut.",

        "text": "I am a Paramedic in an urban EMS system, and the day can be great or miserable depending on how things go with your partner. Last week I was working with what I would describe as a drama king and is how I will refer to him. Its been awhile so sorry for vagueness but the work days all run together and some details fall away as I recall from memory. He is the typical overly alpha/macho type and controlling. Weightlifter and talked about the good deals he gets on creatine while shopping online. Single and probably frustrated, more on that below. I have had some issues with partners in the past, but today it got to the point where I decided to get back at him.\n\nWe have student ride alongs on occasion, but that day our rider was an already certified EMT who works in a clinic on a nearby military base. The clinic is slower so they spend time with us for more patient contacts and variety. She had been deployed to field hospitals in the middle east and had dealt with some serious situations. I was not worried about how she would handle herself in any situation during the shift and she was clearly competent and professional, but my parter continuously referred to her as a student. Our rider is married and obviously very intelligent but drama king was trying to flex his game and didn't respect that she was unavailable. Spoke to her in a condescending way during patient care. \"Get me a blood pressure and heart rate.\" Shit like that.\n\nDrama king would make backhanded comments at me and try to \"establish dominance\" even though as the only medic on the truck I am responsible for what happens. Making personal comments about patients and referring to nursing home and the homeless as, \"people I don't care about\" when the call was over (I wish I was joking). Yelling \"OMG WTF THIS IS BULLSHIT\" each time we got a call or moved posts.\n\nBy chance drama king had three patients in a row from nursing homes which was an unusual increase in his workload. He kept getting more and more agitated and making comments as each call went on and was soon, at least in my mind, promoted to King of the Douchbags. (KD from now on lol)\n\nI can work with most anybody, but these traits especially piss me off: Laziness, being an ass, and being incompetent. One trait is fine. If someone works hard and is competent but an asshole thats OK. If someone is nice, works hard, but are at times incompetent, thats alright. You get the gist of it. Now if my partner has two of those traits at a time were gonna have problems, and three traits shits gonna hit the fan. All three were clearly on display so it was time to act.\n\nThe dispatcher at the time and I are friends and have known each other for years. I call him up after call three in a row for KD and ask him to \"Put us on the top of your transfer and Bravo alone (non-emergency transport) list cause my partner is getting more and more agitated and its making me smile inside\". I said that on a recorded line haha! Dispatcher goes, \"Oh, your partner needs more practice? No problem.\" My smile goes from an inside one to out because I know the pain thats coming KD's way.\n\nWe run four more back to back transfers for various non-emergency situations like hospital discharges to rehab, nursing home patients returning to facilities post hospital admission etc. KD is getting more and more agitated after each and starts saying \" I don't get paid enough to work like this\" and \"I'm putting in my two weeks.\" Starts venting to other crews about how he ran \"SEVEN CALLS OMG IVE NEVER HAD SO MANY FCK MY LYFE BRO. SOMEBODY MUST BE FCKIN WITH ME\". He had no idea that the dispatcher and I were in on it.\n\nHe looked miserable so I figured he had enough. I call up the dispatcher to tell him \"well played\" and we had a good laugh. It was close to end of shift so it was time to drive the lesson home to my partner. I tell him that bitching and moaning about having to work only makes his own stress go up and makes everyone else's day miserable. He seemed taken back by my comment but replied with comments along the line of \" Thats just who I am\" and \"Cant handle me at my worst then you don't deserve me at my best\" horse shit. OK, whatever homeboy. At least I tried.\n\nAs I was finishing writing reports at the office he comes up to me and says that he has a new respect for us medics because we transport 8-10+ patients that are much sicker than his every single day. He mentions he has been working too much lately and needs to work on his attitude. To his credit he actually apologized for making our day harder than necessary, which I did not expect. I said something like keeping things relaxed will only help you in the long run and they have us for 12 hours so fighting it will only make it worse. Also to advocate for himself and take time off if he needs to. Things we have to do to stay sane and have long careers in EMS.\n\nI hope he can find some balance in his work and home life and that he can have some satisfaction with his situation or change it for the better. Maybe this was the catalyst for him to change. I hope so. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "Picture it: I'm working full-time as a warehouse aid/forklift driver which means lots of hard work, heavy lifting and coming home utterly exhausted and covered in dust/dirt/grease. I'm also doing community college part-time online, which means working late into the night and often into the early hours of the morning to get everything done. The cherry on top is my Asshole Stepfather whose constant passive aggressive attacks and general asshole behavior have me so on edge and anxious that I developed a chronic stomach illness because of it. Add the to misery a trio of serious psychological disorders (undiagnosed at this point) and I think you get the point; not fun times. It should come as no surprise that I coveted sleep above all else.\n\nOur story begins on a Monday when Asshole Stepfather's asshole son and co. arrive on motorcycles to stay the week. By some miracle I'm asleep when they get in (very late), but because my room is located directly above the garage, I'm woken by the noise and the reverb and then the all the talking and laughing and loud conversation. As I hadn't yet acquired a spine I wait out the noise and try to make light of it with everyone the next morning. I also ask them for a little consideration and tell myself the rest of the week won't be so bad. Poor me. Poor, stupid me.\n\nTuesday I put off college work and go to bed early to try and catch up on Monday's lost sleep. It doesn't happen. Loud engines, reverb, talking, laughing... the usual. Only this time I can't get back to sleep. So I get up, go downstairs and get on the computer to try and get some work done and study for final exams. Because there is no door separating the kitchen/computer area from the TV room where everyone is sleeping I'm having to creep around quietly and study in shitty half-light so 'the boyz' can get their beauty rest.\n\nBy Wednesday an additional visitor has arrived without warning, and at this point the noise and chaos at home has reached critical and so has my tolerance for inconsiderate bullshit. I'm barely able to keep awake during the day, there's classwork to be done that I simply don't have the energy for, finals are fast approaching, I'm stressed from trying to get everything in order so I can transfer schools, and I'm convinced I'm losing my mind but why should anyone give a good goddamn? I'm just an angsty moody teenager so fuck me, I guess.\n\nNow, something that must be noted real quick: my family wasn't rich. This meant that just about every appliance we owned was old and loud as hell. We're talking industrial levels of noise here. I think you know where this is going.\n\nEarly morning Thursday... something has happened. The alarm sounds and my eyes fly open. I rip the blankets off of me and in a minute I'm dressed and stomping down the stairs just as loud as I can with a purpose and a black rage. I give the light switches a loud smack... *all of them*... and suddenly the place is lit up like a pro football stadium.\n\nAlready I can hear stirring in the TV room, followed by the telltale grumble of disturbed rest.\n\nOh, y'all wanted some sleep? COCKA-FUCKIN-DOODLE-DOO, ASSHOLES!\n\nThe kitchen is transformed into a whirlwind of noise and clamor.\n\nMicrowave? On.\n\nDishwasher? On.\n\nRadio? On and cranked up to max.\n\nExhaust fan? I'm convinced they installed a small jet engine by mistake. ON!\n\nAnything and everything that could generate noise found useful employment that morning. I threw open cupboard doors and rattled cutlery and flushed toilets and ran water and stomped around until it was time for me to leave for work, and you better believe I slammed that front door hard enough that the windows shook.\n\nOf course I get chewed out for it later on, but I couldn't help but notice how quiet it got after that. It's called Karma, fuckers, and it's spelled 'ha ha ha'.\n\nTL;DR: Inconsiderate guests disturb my sleep; I return the favor.",

I asked them to “bring it down a notch” without raising my voice or trying to embarrass them. They obviously didn’t like that because I heard them talking about “this bitch is telling us to shut up” and just going over and over it. \n\nI noticed when the flight attendant came by to offer drinks they bought some beers. When the flight attendant asked my drink order, I told her that those women had a bunch of drinks in the gate area and if they had more it would be overserving them.

        "text": "This past spring, I had the amazing opportunity to go to another university in the country on a language-based exchange (French) for a month. To put it briefly, you basically live as a student there, going to classes in the morning while they had activities at night. Another important point was you had to speak french your entire stay, or else you can be penalized! However, you were free to speak English during events such as emergencies or talking to your family on the phone. And of course, this included Karaoke.\n\nEvery Tuesday, the university bar would have a karaoke night where you can sing songs (of any language) and just have a good time. Technically it starts at 10, but if you want to get up onstage early or not want to wait for hours, you'd probably have to get there around 9:30. However, as some people pre-drank before, you can imagine many would be there later, and therefore would have to wait it out to sing their song. Being one of the only events to really stand out, one can only imagine how much the place reeks or showboating and desperation.\n\nThis particular Tuesday, my friends (Lisa, Emily, and Katie) and I have been planning since last Tuesday to sing Bohemian Rhapsody, to the point where we have been practicing every day after class. It was the last Tuesday of the program, so it's definitely going to be packed and the best chance to leave our legacy. At around 9pm, we decided to practice a bit more and quickly take some shots before heading there at 9:30 and reserve a good spot. One thing led to another, and we ended up showing up at 10:15, buzzed. While late and already busy, we still were able to get our song up on the queue. It was a bit busier than average, but we estimated our time to come around 11 or so. We just watched from the audience, dancing to songs and living out the night. \n\nMost songs are on average 3-5 minutes (unless it's Mirrors from Justin Timberlake). Anyways our 11 pm Showtime was pretty guaranteed, if it wasn't for a girl who kept coming onstage, dancing wildly to distract the current singers or even trying to steal the mic! Let's call her Karen. Karen was those type of cheerleader-wannabees girls who believes she is Marilyn Monroe incarnate and that her daddy can give her anything. Of course, this came with an air of \"I-am-more-important-than-you,\" whether it means butting in a busy line at the local café or loudly talking on speakerphone in the halls. It irked me throughout the program but I steered clear.\n\nWith Karen continually sabotaging each performance, it takes longer for each song to get through. My friends and I were visibly annoyed, and so was everyone from the crowd to the DJ. However nobody can really do anything about it and just let her have ALL the time in the spotlight, this one guy even left halfway and she just continued where he left off. \n\nBecause of this, we had to wait 2+ hours for our time, which is already bordering 12:30. But when we got onstage, we were so happy and relieved. 2 important details: 1) If it was a really popular song, some people other than the intended singers would also come onstage and sing along WITHOUT obstruction and 2) There were only 2 microphones; wired to a speaker. \n\nWhen we got onstage, I shared a microphone with Katie, while Lisa shared the other with Emily. Our friends were in the background for support, and so we started it off with perfection; the crowd dug it up and attention was all on us. It was bliss.\n\nAt least until hecking Karen came onstage. Before I even got to the first \"Mama,\" this little [insert garden tool here] SNATCHED the microphone from Katie and I and proceeded to go to the other side of the stage and start singing. Some people started booing and Katie even tried to ask her for it back, but she simply put her hand up and regaled in the moment. I was furious. We waited 2 hours thanks to her for our limelight, only to be stolen by her again. I was fuming, but I can only continue singing.\n\nBy the time we got to \"So you think you can stone me,\" the crowd has built up from all the excitement. Seeing this as a perfectly reasonable time to ask for the mic back, I stretched my arm out to her with an open palm, asking for it back. Of course, she simply slapped it. This triggered Emily who had already enough of her crap, so in a fury, she marched to the speaker and tried to unplug her speaker. The wires were very thick and we weren't 100%, so we couldn't do it. I tried helping, but at this point, I tried instead to unplug the cable from the mic. So I marched up to 3 feet away from her, and tried pulling it. Again, nothing. So, with one last try, I put all my strength into one last pull.\n\nDid I mention the cable was very very thick? In my last pull, to get more momentum, I slid my hand loosely up the cable and then ideally, that would be enough to pull it out with a stronger grip. But thanks to the thick wire, I instead pushed the microphone up, and then down.\nKaren was so obsessed with having her voice heard, the microphone was centimetres from her face. So, the microphone smashed her face. Then, it fell down and made a huge thud thanks to the feedback(?).\n\nAt this point, I knew I screwed up since this is beyond of what I wanted. As such amidst the confusion, I quickly slumped into Katie's arms and acted really really drunk, asking to be taken home before I whispered, \"We have to go now\" to avoid suspicion. Confused and it's almost 1 am anyway, we all headed home.\n\nTomorrow at class, Karen did not show up and at lunch, it was evident why, and why everyone was talking about her and how some unknown person \"served her right\" last night. Let me fill you in.\n\nWhen I pushed the mic up, it hit her nose and mouth, causing her nose to bleed and I think left a mark I'm sure. When she dropped it, everyone literally stopped and looked at her. Of course, I'm sure Karen didn't want attention at that point in time, especially with a bruised and bleeding nose and her shouting obscenities. Embarrassed, she apparently tried to get offstage while people were avoiding her, when the true hero of the day stepped in. Literally. Lisa had enough of her antics and as Karen tried to move out, Lisa gave her a slight shove forward. This caused Karen to lose balance and fall into some girls, who took one look at her and said, \"Ew. Gross.\" She then reportedly started crying and quickly left the bar.\n\nLast time I saw her was the second last day before departure day at the bar. There was some impromptu dancing and singing to speakers onstage, but that day I'm pretty sure she stuck to just sitting down with some beer. I smiled.",

        "text": "This happened in March of my senior year of college, during spring break week. I was flying to a job interview on the dreadful pre-dawn 5:00 AM flight, wearing a suit and tie and crammed in the middle seat of the last row because the interview had come together at the last minute. The plane’s door was just about to close with all the seats around me empty when here they came: about 6-8 guys my age, all wearing bro tanks, board shorts, and flip flops (it was about 30 degrees outside), totally plastered and reeking of booze. They made it clear to everyone else on the plane that they were heading for a frat spring break party in Cancun.  \n\nFrom the get go they were loud, yelling, swearing, the whole deal. As soon as we reached altitude they start crushing the cheap beer from the beverage cart. People around us are starting to get pissed and I’m getting a little self-conscious because I hate that this is everyone’s impression of college-aged guys. The guy next to me is the worst, hitting the call button for no reason every 10 minutes, obnoxiously macking on the flight attendant, making some racist and misogynistic jokes to his bro across the aisle. Then he passes out and slouches over on my shoulder, literally drooling on me, with his bare foot up on my leg, overpowering me with the stench of stale beer. I’ve had enough. It’s time for the pettiest revenge imaginable.\n\nNext time the flight attendant (God bless her for putting up with these types of people every day) comes past, I order a cranberry juice. When she’s reaching over to hand me the cup filled with juice, I oh so accidentally fumble it onto Brotastic’s white board shorts. He wakes up and is like, “What the fuuuuuckkk?” Then as he stands up to go to the bathroom, all his friends look at the red stain on his crotch and almost in unison: “Oh my God bro, are you on your period???”\n\nBest part of the story: The flight attendant felt bad about spilling my drink (although I assured her it was no fault of hers), and she moved me up to an empty seat in the first row of coach. I ended up making my connection by about 30 seconds—would have missed it from my original seat—and got the job.",

        "text": "Santa's petty revenge, not mine.\n\nI had a summer job at the end of high school taking photos of children with Santa at shopping centres. The Santa visits were free and paid for by the shopping centres for promotional/marketing purposes. Families had to pay for photos if they wanted us to take them, but otherwise the experience was free, and the kids got a small gift from Santa when they left. Some smart person in upper management thought it would be a good idea to order plastic recorders as gifts for the children! Well ... that went down about as well as you can imagine. After lots of complaints, the management eventually ordered some small toy cars and animals and things of that sort. Everyone was much happier.\n\nWhen I stated my shift one morning I was going through the room I'd been assigned and was making sure everything was set up for taking photos and the kids and everything. I filled up Santa's bag with toys and was ready for the room's first visitors at 8am.\n\nIn walks Santa with a spare Santa bag with a few things in it. From the bag's shape it looked like there were some plastic recorders in it. I mentioned that management had provided us with some alternative toys due to complaints from parents. He chuckled and let out a jolly, \"Ho, ho, ho! And the children just \\*love\\* them!\" I knew right away I had the always-in-character Santa. I'd heard about him, but not worked with him before. He was one of the few Santas with an actual long white beard, which was kinda cool. You could tell he really loved his job.\n\nThe first few visits went really well. The families in line had waited for 1.5hrs that morning (LPT: visit Santa in the afternoon, it's always quieter) and the children were all very well behaved and really excited to meet Santa. When each of these children would arrive, this Santa would pull out a clipboard and consult his \"list\" of whether the children had been naughty or nice (spoiler: Santa would joke with them sometimes, but they were always listed as 'nice'). I was impressed with how much effort he put into the character and the acting for the children - they all loved it. Santa was giving out the new toys, too, not the plastic recorders.\n\nOn about the fourth or fifth visit we had a family with a mother (we'll call her Naughty Mother) and her two children who were dressed up in formal attire. The children were about 4 or 5, I guess. After a few minutes of the children interacting with Santa, Naughty Mother turns to me and says, \"Do you know how to take a good photo?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I mean, I've been taking them all summer, so I hope so!\"\n\n\"I'll be the judge of that!\" says Naughty Mother.\n\nSanta gave me a subtle look as if he overheard Naughty Mother and disapproved. Santa was making his list ...\n\nNaughty Mother announces in a high-pitched, giddy voice that the children will have a photo with Santa now. She begins rearranging everything. Moving the tree, moving bags and other paraphernalia to \"make it look Christmasy\". After a solid 5 minutes of this nonsense, with her repeatedly bossing everyone around - her children, me, and even Santa! -  she finally takes a seat next to Santa and without saying anything else just says in the same high-pitched, giddy voice, \"Cheese!\"\n\nI take the photo. It looks terrible because she has moved the tree and other things which are now blocking the lights we have set-up. Also, the children look bored because they've been sitting still for too long. The Santa had a wide grin, but he was a pro!\n\nBefore I can even look up to explain that we need to move some things for better lighting, Naughty Mother has got up out of her seat, saying, \"Let's see!\"\n\nShe sees it on the screen and basically has a complete outburst, cursing me out before I can even explain. She starts going on about how I must not know what I'm doing, etc. etc. Santa steps in at this point and says, \"Now, now, this little helper of mine is quite good at taking photos! Why don't we try taking another one?\"\n\nMomentarily embarrassed, Naughty Mother puts on a fake smile and agrees. I quickly grab a small ladder and change the angle of some of the lights and move the tree slightly. I get the children to jump up and do a big stretch and then get them back into position, tell them a dumb joke, and take the photo. It's perfect - everyone smiling, good lighting, all good.\n\nNaughty Mother, not to be outdone and still perhaps a bit embarrassed, says, upon coming up and looking at the screen, \"That's better! Why couldn't you have just done it like that the first time, dear?\"\n\nAs I'm apologising to Naughty Mother for the inconvenience, Santa reaches into his bag and produces three plastic recorders. He gives one to each child and starts teaching them \"Jingle Bells\".\n\nNaughty Mother's fake smile got really wide.\n\ntl;dr Santa gave plastic recorders to a mother's children after she was rude me",

You'd wake up hoping to eat your leftover pizza for breakfast and you'd find an empty box next to the sofa.  Ramen noodles for lunch.  Gone.  Chef Boyardee for dinner.  Gone.  When he ate a full length \nSubway sandwich I'd left in the fridge for dinner, that was the final straw.  My \"real\" roommate and I were eating at Buffalo Wild Wings and came up with a plan.  We ordered 6 of their Blazing wings to go.  Then we went to the store and bought some Dave's Insanity sauce.  At the time, this was the hottest stuff around.  I remember on the back it said something like \"Add one drop at a time to your food\" We COATED the Blazing wings in this stuff.  We got home and wrote my name on the box and put it in the fridge.  When we got up the next morning, the box was on the table in front of the couch.  Open.  One wing had one bite out of it.  He never ate our food again.",

        "text": "This is my first post EVER! So I apologize if this is in the wrong area, formatting or anything else I screw up. Wasn't sure where this story fits but I feel like this is a good home.\n\nTL;DR at the end\n\nThis story is close to 15 years old so I can't remember all the details. I do remember the important parts though. I was a sophomore in high school refereeing for a our local PAL.\n\nThis day I had to do a 6th grade boys championship game with a friend. Most of the refs in our town played sports together. It so happened this other ref was on the high school basketball team with me. So we know the rules and we understand how the game is played.\n\nThis game in particular was worse then normal.  It felt we could have called a foul every other play. Being a championship game, parents were very vocal. Nothing crazy in the beginning but by the end it got out of hand. One fan in particular. We will call him Fanny for the rest of this.\n\nDuring a trip to the scores table to report a foul Fanny stands up points at me and I don't  remember his words but I do know it got my attention. So I calmly go over to the coach of fanny's team and ask him to control his parents. Coach was great  he immediately turns around and asks everyone to calm down. Most of the parents get the hint and don't say a word. Fanny though won't stop he gets louder. Takes a step down to get closer to me. I tell the coach final warning before I issue a technical foul on him.\n\nCoach says something to Fanny, Fanny sits down. Next play I call another foul on fanny's team. That is it he has had it. He goes off on me, Coach is trying to calm him down. Now I could have issued the Technical foul. But the coach was trying and I thought that might make the situation worse. So part 1 of the petty revenge. I kick out fanny of the gym. Takes him a minute to leave but he goes realizing the game won't continue until he leaves.\n\nThe outcome of the game was not in question Fanny's team was going to lose. I know you may think I was calling it this way. I wasn't, to be honest I was nervous because of the interaction with Fanny, I was doing the best I could. Game ends.\n\nA player from Fanny's team unleashes slew of foul words at the other ref and I. I mean it was impressive for a 6th grader. When something like this happens we can't do anything for that season since its over but we got his name and he would have to sit out next years first game. We reported it to the person running the league.\n\nTurns out the player was fanny's kid. Part 2 of revenge not knowingly. We get his son suspended from games in the next season. I never followed up on this so I don't know if this actually happened. But I like to think it did\n\nNow I went out of the gym to the common area/concession area. Fanny is waiting for me. He b lines it for me. Screaming this was harassment and we is going to sue for me and my family for everything we are worth. He is inches away from my chest. Mainly because he was 5'5 and I was 6'3. He doesn't touch me but is very close. I try walking away into a separate room where the refs leave their stuff. He follows and continues with threats and just trying to belittle me. Now I wasn't scared or even annoyed I actually was laughing because of how crazy all this was at the time.\n\nOut of nowhere a parent of another ref comes in and gives it to Fanny saying he is calling the cops get out of here. He tells me I will be hearing from his lawyer and leaves.\n\nOk so my parents here all this and get pissed. Then they get even more pissed. He actually tries suing me. A few weeks later they have a big meeting at the PAL building with Fanny his lawyer and about 12 other PAL officials parents and coaches at the game.\n\nI was not allowed to go. Meeting goes how you would expect after reading this. Everyone is defending me and my actions. To the point where they were discussing pressing charges on Fanny with my parents approval. Part 3 revenge.\n\nFanny had to stand up apologize for his actions and was not allowed to step foot in the building for 1 year. We never even thought of pressing charges just used it as a ploy to get him realize is mistake.\n\nLast but not least part 4 revenge.\n\nSenior year refereeing a 8th grade game. I get Fanny and his son's team. He is allowed back in the building since his ban is up. I foul out his son by the third quarter. Not a beep from him or his son. I gave him a quick smile after the final foul...….That is where the petty revenge comes in I think. What I did was not fair but it felt good and I don't regret it.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFan gets rowdy, fan gets ejected, fan tries to sue ref. Ref gets apology and then fouls out son next game!",

        "text": "The company I work for relies on a 3rd party vendor to host some of our systems and websites. One day back in February a bunch of employees lose access to some of the vendors websites and I'm tasked with contacting the vendor, identifying the issue, and getting it fixed. \n\nI send some emails, make some calls, get bounced between a few departments, and finally get referred to a network tech named John. I feel like I know what the issue is so I email him with some specific questions about the VPN connection between our respective offices. No response. I send the same questions to a few other people but they just keep referring me to John who, after a few days, still hasn't responded.\n\nAfter some significant troubleshooting I identify the issue and make some changes internally that fixes the issue.\n\nIt's July, 5 months after the issue was resolved, and guess who I get an email from. Fucking John. This motherfucker replied to my email 5 months after receiving it. And apparently he was the right guy to contact because he provided all the information I needed to solve the problem 5 fucking months ago!\n\nHe ended the email with \"Was this information helpful?\" and I'm torn between ignoring him or tearing him a new one for wasting my time. \n\nThen it hits me. \n\nI write a very professional email thanking him for taking the time to reply but mentioning that the information would have been much more helpful back in February when the issue was ongoing. Before hitting send I set up an email delay. He'll get my reply 5 months from now.\n\ntl;dr Asshat replies to a 5 month old email with info that was critical 5 months ago. I set up a delayed email to thank him 5 months from now. ",

        "text": "Not sure this is petty enough but here it goes!\n\nOne day I came back off my weekend to find out my department screwed up bad. What I was told is that a file with very strict performance guarantees arrived 8 hours late to the client causing about a $15,000 fine. The reason it was late? We did not call the on-call group about this problem.\n\nNow, I already don't like this group because their boss has a habit of making temporary processes permanent. So I message my friend on our voice team and have him pull our call logs from that day. Low and behold we did call them about 30 seconds after sending them an email with info. By this time it is too late to damage control this so all our big wigs think we are inept.\n\nSince this teams manager passed the blame off on us we got a new requirement. This team now requires us to open a ticket to them, send a page through our paging program (which goes to the on-calls cell phone), send an email with the ticket and a description of the problem (done automatically when you open the ticket so this is a 2nd email), and call 4 people on their team. One of them being the manager I do not like.\nEvery single time I start the phone calls every single one of them complains to stop this. I inform them that this is because a problem they ignored for 8 hours and incorrectly blamed us has created this rule. It's especially satisfying because the person that put this in place and complains the most about it? The manager I do not like. I call her last that way it's slightly later in the night.\n\nTL;DR - Manager who lied and I don't like put in a process that she doesn't like and I follow the process to the letter.",

        "text": "I had driven my big 40' RV into town and was checking on my property there. It was late and there were no campgrounds even close by so I just parked it in front of a green space around the corner from my property and went to sleep in back. \n\nAbout midnight I hear a commotion and voices and within seconds I realize that there are four teenage guys climbing up the back ladder of my bus sized RV and jumping around on the roof, which is about 12' off the ground. Not only stupid but there's a lot of stuff up there that can get damaged easily including the roof itself - which is VERY expensive to repair.\n\nIt took a second or two to fully wake up but without hesitating, I made a plan. I knew from all the talking they didn't suspect there was anybody inside. I was in my 'old man tighty whitey' underwear but without hesitation, I grabbed a baseball bat, threw open the door, ran to the back, and with the loudest voice screamed, \"GET THE FUCK OFF MY ROOF YOU ASSHOLES!\"\n\nFor half a second they froze and only one of them actually glanced my way. \n\nThen all four of them JUMPED from roof to the ground, 12 feet down and they hit the ground running for the nearest alley. The last one down actually turned his ankle on landing and his run looked pretty limpy but he still booked off at high speed. It was really satisfying to see how scared they were.\n\nI am more than sure that if they ever see an RV parked there again, they won't be climbing on the roof!",
