        "text": "I experienced some mild downvoting in a subreddit ostensibly devoted to pure discussion, which caused me to reflect on the nature of discussion on Reddit. I feel like Reddit is built for, and thrives on, oppositional dialogue.\n\nIn each thread of conversation, you may either (a) agree with those above you, producing the circle jerk, or (b) disagree, producing a chain of upvoted/downvoted comments. Because response to comments is indicated by a dichotomy (up or down), it seems natural to approach a comment with this dichotomy in mind - that is, do I agree or disagree? Each comment is considered with this in mind.\n\nOver time, Redditors are trained to think in this way: \"Is this comment 'good' or 'bad'?\" In subreddits this can take the form of establishing group identity - \"Does this comment reflect the ideals of our group, or is it from an outsider who must be scourged and driven from the premises?\" This partitioning occurs in many settings on the Internet, but it seems to me to be encouraged by the upvote/downvote mechanism in particular on Reddit, so that people naturally look for the cracks or hooks in a comment - minor quibbles on which they can hang their decision, to upvote or downvote?\n\nOr is this merely a feature of certain subreddits that are already oppositional by nature? In places where the need for a group identity is strongly felt (say, /r/politics) outsiders are scourged with the downvote, but in places where there is no good sense of group identity (e.g. /r/science) the dichotomy is not enforced.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2fv542/addressing_the_false_ideal_of_online_free_speech/",
        "text": "The following is an edited-down and more neutral version of [a blog post I wrote here](http://enduringbeta.com/2014/09/08/reddit-and-the-false-ideal-of-online-free-speech/) about Reddit's answer to the nefarious behavior on their site. I'm very interested to have a discussion about how much sense it makes and what should be done.\n\n---\n\nReddit was ground zero for a significant portion of the proliferation of the stolen celebrity photos that occurred last week. I didn't follow the events as they happened, but they caused a lot of internal strife within the Reddit community. Save a few select subreddits I am much more withdrawn from the website than I was a year ago.\n\nReddit administrator yishan wrote a blog post announcement in response to the issue. (alienth made further clarification that doesn't change my opinion of the original very much at all.) In it, he makes several statements that I find indefensible or profoundly weak answers to very serious problems on their website.\n\n&gt; Last weekend, reddit was used as one of the primary centers of distribution of private and unlawfully obtained images of celebrities.\n\n&gt; In accordance with our legal obligations, we expeditiously removed content hosted on our servers as soon as we received DMCA requests from the lawful owners of that content, and in cases where the images were not hosted on our servers, we promptly directed them to the hosts of those services.\n\n&gt; While current US law does not prohibit linking to stolen materials, we deplore the theft of these images and we do not condone their widespread distribution.\n\nYeah, Reddit was a major distribution zone. That's a big problem. Good, they responded to DMCA requests as legally required. Feels like they could have done more, though. Let's read on.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, reddit’s platform is structurally based on the ability for people to distribute, promote, and highlight textual materials as well as links to images and other media. We understand the harm that misusing our site does to the victims of this theft, and we deeply sympathize.\n\n&gt; Having said that, we are unlikely to make changes to our existing site content policies in response to this specific event.\n\nThey're addressing this problem... in no way at all?!\n\n&gt; The reason is because we consider ourselves not just a company running a website where one can post links and discuss them, but the government of a new type of community. The role and responsibility of a government differs from that of a private corporation, in that it exercises restraint in the usage of its powers.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; The philosophy behind this stems from the idea that each individual is responsible for his or her moral actions.\n\n&gt; We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you - the user - has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so. When you know something is right, you should choose to do it. But as much as possible, we will not force you to do it.\n\n&gt; You choose what to post. You choose what to read. You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce. We will try not to interfere - not because we don’t care, but because we care that you make your choices between right and wrong.\n\n&gt; Virtuous behavior is only virtuous if it is not arrived at by compulsion. This is a central idea of the community we are trying to create.\n\nReddit \"deplore[s] the theft\" and they \"do not condone\" the distribution. They \"deeply sympathize\" with the harm done by it. But they will take no action?! That renders their words as nothing more than platitudes. They are pointless and useless.\n\nTheir defense of inaction is an appeal to a visionary plan of democratic utopia. Do they not understand their pet project is at the expense of the well-being of people both in and outside of it?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Let's talk about what's so wrong with this answer.\n\nA functioning democracy needs to allow as much speech as possible to prevent tyranny. It's a necessary right the people must have to be able to express grievances. To start imposing censorship laws on the people beyond what is necessary (preventing \"fire\" in a crowd, for example, is necessary) may invite more and more restrictions infringing upon important, productive speech.\n\nThis speech is important because it influences the rights of individual citizens. Toying with actual free speech can have severe consequences, risking the stability and well-being of people and their nation.\n\nA private website, community, business, or home, in contrast, does not hold the same risk and is not obligated to the same standard. The collapse of any of these institutions would not result in a loss of personal freedom or risk the destruction of the country itself. A website going down, a group of friends dissolving, or a company folding does not impact an individual's rights or ability to express oneself. It may deny them an audience, but that is not a right.\n\nI would argue that these private institutions are not only unobligated to espouse free speech, but that they should impose behavior restrictions to create more habitable and welcoming environments. I believe this is where the future of positive online spaces will be.\n\nHow is it a virtuous pursuit at all to create a work environment where any type of speech is allowed? Human resources departments exist for a reason. It's not up to individual employees to pressure individuals into better behavior. They should face consequences or leave.\n\nWhy is it better to tolerate assholes at your house party in hopes that they eventually change their ways? Why should you subject your other guests to this process?\n\nWhy is the ideal of a group of people who could act badly but don't (which will not happen at Reddit's current trajectory anyway) more important than creating and cultivating an actual, positive environment with protective rules?\n\nEven within Reddit we see successes and failures along these lines. /r/AskScience and /r/AskHistorians are fantastic subreddits because their moderators are tireless in deleting asininity. (/r/TheoryOfReddit, as well.) Over time I have no doubt this fostered a culture of more intelligent discussion. In contrast, /r/spacedicks remains one of many fetid warts on the underbelly of the website, allowing anything legal.\n\nAgain, there are costs to what Reddit is experimenting with. Racism, homophobia, sexism, abuse, hate, and entitlement all receive safe haven on Reddit. Reddit is a platform for hate groups to organize, grow in number, embolden, and take action. These groups don't just invade other subreddits and create horrid environments. They cause harm outside of the website's community: contributing to a culture of spreading and popularizing child pornography, breaking traffic numbers by linking to stolen photos of celebrities (Ashamedly, alienth says, but with no action.), and providing space for racism. Reddit also slightly profited off of each of these situations with user-paid gifts of gold to other users.\n\n---\n\nI get that policing Reddit is hard. There are millions of users and even more posts and comments. It's a game of whack-a-mole. But the answer is not to relinquish responsibility. It's not to pass the buck down to users, either. And it's absolutely not to appeal to some high-minded project as a pitiful excuse. This ideal will not materialize, and Reddit needs to understand the costs of this fruitless endeavor. 4chan is not a model to look up to.\n\nI believe Reddit should create stronger rules and hold volunteer mods accountable to them. They should take stances on issues and make choices on what they'll tolerate. Over time the abusers will find other places, hopefully less convenient, to gather. It's either this or Reddit will continue to slink down into the hole that other online communities exist in: going down with its ship of idealism.\n\nI believe that by discussing this, and by more people coming to this conclusion, change is more likely to happen.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR: Reddit uses the ideal of free speech to excuse its inaction in removing horrible content. I believe in any private institution, it is far, far better to rather extol the virtues of a more positive space by restricting hateful speech. The harm Reddit does reaches beyond its own borders, as well, pointing to an irresponsibility of its administration.**",

These canaries provide the ability for *every single user* to verify - to some degree - that what they are seeing has or hasn't been censored or compelled.\n\nHow do we know that reddit isn't being censored by some government or other large entity?\n\nHow do reddit admins verify that another admin hasn't compromised the integrity of reddit?\n\nHow does a subreddit moderator know that a reddit admin hasn't unfairly played with their subreddit?\n\nHow does a reddit user know that both reddit admins and moderators aren't censoring the content they are posting?\n\nI don't know if all of these questions have feasible answers to them.\n\nBut if reddit's users came up with some code based off of [reddit's source code](https://github.com/reddit/reddit) and asked reddit developers to implement them, and there was no good reason to reject this code, then isn't reddit's philosophy such that it would adopt those changes? (from what CEO yishan has said, the answer is: yes)\n\nIf you're still following what I'm saying and you're agreeing, then how about our first canary? If we ask reddit to put up an official page that says \"we have never been served a National Security Letter\", and this request is either ignored or denied, then wouldn't that answer our question about whether or not reddit is or has been censored?\n\nIf there comes a time when a majority of reddit (or internet) users say: \"don't use reddit any more, it is being censored\", then we can take reddit's source code, change it to be more free of censorship, and start another version of reddit. That's one of the reasons why reddit is open-source. The community can come together and improve upon the foundations that have been laid.",

This is common in mid-level and developing city subreddits, where a significant number of posts come from new arrivals following economic opportunity. New arrivals (and subscribers) are generalized as being the reason the city and subreddit are declining in quality. These subreddits tend to treat tourists a bit nicer, but are discouraging of those who actually want to move to the city. A lot of this comes from fear of economic instability and the idea that an influx of new residents is going to severely mess up their idealized image of the city they live in.\n\nHate: In these subreddits, subscribers can largely be broken into two distinct groups. First, the incredibly self-loathing \"I hate this city\" types who view where they live as some sort of prison that needs escaping from. Second, the \"real city\" folks who see themselves as more truly representing the city itself. They usually balk at the complaints made by the first group and view them as not really understanding or fitting in with where they live.\n\nIts interesting because if you think about it, the cities that fall into the Hate end of the spectrum are normally ultra-developed and major global hubs.\n\nIn other words, the Hate subreddits have sometimes started off on the Pride end and evolved over time. The self-loathing types end up being original inhabitants who couldn't score as much economic opportunity as the new arrivals. They get bitter, the newer, more successful arrivals then tell them they're wrong, and it cycles out as they become even more bitter and feel a sense of possession that they aren't reaping the benefits of economic success in \"their\" city.\n\nI understand that this is all really sweeping generalizations and I haven't named specific subreddits, but I wanted it that way as to keep the discussion a bit more academic and not have it descend into a flamewar.\n\n",

Why is the \"improved\" post failing?  (Is it the perception that it is a repost,  the popularity of the other background, or just bad luck?)\n2. Should /r/AdviceAnimals mods try to enforce thematic standards for the memes?  It seems like the right move for the jokes to make sense in the future, but the overuse of a popular meme regardless of relevance seems to draw more attention from front page users, perhaps interested in a background they haven't seen yet.   \n3.

They are all worth 0G. There is also an achievement for subscribing to the subreddit /r/xboxone. \n\nI have personally noticed that since the release a lot valid of posts are being downvoted over at /r/xboxone and other members have suggested to go in certain threads in other subreddits and downvote/upvote every post (or downvote then upvote 500 post) to get the achievements.\n\nCould this be seen as vote manipulation? Especially when people start suggesting to downvote/upvote in other subreddits.  \n\nI doubt the intend of the developers was to encourage people to go in threads and downvote/upvote all the comments to get the achievements but more to make users use the app more by visiting to their regular subreddits and vote like normal, giving a nice reward when using the app. \n\nShould apps give rewards for voting/subscribe to specific subreddits or should they refrain from doing it? What are good measures against these kind of rewards (if you do not agree with them) besides removing them all together?",

        "text": "So the reddit [about page](http://www.reddit.com/about/) shows some statistics including **unique visitors** over the last month. This is interesting since this is on of the better metrics to measure how many people visit a website since it is based on things like ip address so someone visiting reddit is only counted once. There are some limiting factors but it is a much better measurement than say subscribers of large subreddits (which does not include inactive accounts and ignores lurkers) or pageviews (where every single visit is counted including you refreshing that page 10 times since something will not load properly).    \n\nWith the help of the [Internet archive wayback machine](http://archive.org/web/) I decided today to see how far back it did go. Below you'll find the results. Some notes: \n\n- The past two months are not available since the stats have not been updated since July, so the last month available is June. \n   -  I have no idea if this an error on reddit's side of things or intentional. \n- I could go back as far as July 2012, before that the page did show different statistic. \n\n# **lets start with a nice Graph**\n\nWith the help of excel I plotted the data into [a nice looking graph](http://i.imgur.com/C7orLmf.png), I am not that familiar with statistics so I just went with a simple line graph and the full numbers in the side axis. \n\n# **The raw data**\n\nMonth-Year | Unique visitors\n:--|:--\nJul-12 |\t39.747.323\nAug-12 |\t43.318.026\nSep-12 |\t42.245.981\nOct-12 |\t46.839.289\nNov-12 |\t46.441.295\nDec-12 |\t49.035.105\nJan-13 |\t56.060.331\nFeb-13 |\t55.024.811\nMar-13 |\t63.743.366\nApr-13 |\t69.879.749\nMay-13 |\t71.435.935\nJun-13 |\t70.017.371\nJul-13 |\t67.328.706\nAug-13 |\t73.293.644\nSep-13 |\t81.431.088\nOct-13 |\t85.901.746\nNov-13 |\t90.946.972\nDec-13 |\t100.744.653\nJan-14 |\t112.809.633\nFeb-14 |\t112.163.255\nMar-14 |\t114.943.104\nApr-14 |\t109.744.040\nMay-14 |\t113.479.741\nJun-14 |\t114.540.040\n\n\n# **Conclusions?**\n\nI mainly did this because I was curious but there are some things I found interesting. I have no idea if they are statistically significant though: \n\n- Reddit's traffic is not always growing, a few times in the past years traffic was **less** than the month before. \n- The past few months the amount of visitors seems to have leveled out and in April we even see a slight drop. I have no idea how significant this is since it is only a period of 5 months. However looking at the growth before that I thought it was interesting. \n\nI am interested to see what others make of these numbers. \n",

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/2ebls1/people_doing_something_that_makes_themselves_feel/) thread discussed the harsh criticism Reddit gave but did not touch much on *why* it existed.\n\nThis small debacle has got me curious, as negative atmospheres on threads seem to be not uncommon.

Can Reddit admins pick a sub to be default without permission?\n\nTo me, if /r/gaming is undefaulted, it will still be a very active and growing subreddit. Just not as much as it would be if it were a default. If you take out the playground at McDonalds, you still will have kids running around -- just not in a dedicated place.\n\nAs much as I like the idea of  /r/gaming undefaulting -- we may still need a place where people can talk about their girlfriend's Mario cake and post pictures of boxart and their Skyrim memes -- but should that place be a default, here?",

I've always been a bit disconcerted with the fact that serious discussions generally go a couple comments deep and then joke threads take over with low level comments. \n\nI thought of a proposal to make two comment threads. One that would be virtually unmoderated. The only moderation that would occur in this comment thread would be for user privacy and extreme comments. The other thread would feature strict moderation, deletion of joke threads, punny comments, and try to keep the conversation directed at the topic at hand. Similar to /r/askhistorians in the frequency of moderation, probably less intense with regard to sources. \n\nI wonder if any one had thoughts on the viability of such a scheme. Obviously, one thread would be bigger than the other. This would primarily be for bigger subreddits that can sustain two parallel comment threads. If you had any opinions, I'd love to hear. It may be a silly idea, but it could 'save' and foster more meaningful discussions. ",

They gathered their data from stattit, which is now no longer running.\n\nFor this update I gathered data from [redditlist](http://redditlist.com/). While I used the section entitled \"All Subreddits\", it appears to only include SFW subreddits. Therefore, this is a list of the 200 most active SFW subreddits (Edit: Some subreddits are not listed as NSFW, but may still contain a large proportion of NSFW content), while /u/douglasmacarthur's post was a list of the SFW subreddits that were among the top 200 most active subreddits. Because of this, my list includes more subreddits. There are 72 new ones and only 46 knocked off the list, for a net gain of 26. \n\nI have kept the original categorization scheme and tried to place new subreddits where appropriate. ~~A positive change indicates that the subreddit is less active, while a negative change indicates it is more active (relative to other subreddits, and limited by the difference in data sources).~~\n\n**Edit:** Based on community feedback, a negative value now represents that the subreddit dropped places (became relatively less active) while a positive value represents that it became relatively more active.\n\nActivity Rank - Subreddit - Change\n\n**Discussion and Stories**\n\n11 - /r/AskReddit -6\n\n29 - /r/IAmA -20\n\n55 - /r/talesfromtechsupport (new)\n\n67 - /r/bestof -48\n\n72 - /r/TalesFromRetail +76\n\n99 - /r/relationships (new)\n\n143 - /r/offmychest (new)\n\n172 - /r/CrazyIdeas +20\n\n186 - /r/fatpeoplestories -118\n\n*Out:*\n\n/r/pettyrevenge  (91-&gt;206)\n\n/r/DoesAnybodyElse (149-&gt;277)\n\n**Emotional Reaction Fuel**\n\n4 - /r/aww +8\n\n5 - /r/WTF +6\n\n27 - /r/cringepics -5 \n\n53 - /r/oddlysatisfying (new)\n\n65 - /r/creepy +58\n\n76 - /r/mildlyinfuriating +42\n\n101 - /r/nosleep +64  \n\n107 - /r/interestingasfuck (new)\n\n125 - /r/creepyPMs +4\n\n126 - /r/nostalgia +40\n\n135 - /r/cringe -78\n\n*Out:*\n\n/r/JusticePorn  (69-&gt;298)\n\n/r/MorbidReality (78-&gt;NSFW)\n\n/r/rage (106-&gt;225)\n\n**Entertainment - Gaming**\n\n8 - /r/gaming -4\n\n10 - /r/leagueoflegends +11\n\n22 - /r/DotA2 +19\n\n25 - /r/pokemon +/- 0\n\n30 - /r/smashbros (new)\n\n31 - /r/Minecraft -4\n\n35 - /r/Games +4\n\n40 - /r/hearthstone (new)\n\n41 - /r/GlobalOffensive (new)\n\n51 - /r/xboxone (new)\n\n59 - /r/wow +35\n\n79 - /r/tf2 -5\n\n80 - /r/magicTCG +2\n\n85 - /r/mindcrack +12\n\n90 - /r/skyrim -39\n\n91 - /r/GrandTheftAutoV (new)\n\n93 - /r/roosterteeth +19\n\n97 - /r/starcraft -63\n\n105 - /r/PS4 (new)\n\n119 - /r/pathofexile (new)\n\n129 - /r/gamegrumps +16\n\n130 - /r/dayz (new)\n\n134 - /r/Fallout +23\n\n136 - /r/runescape (new)\n\n144 - /r/GameDeals (new)\n\n146 - /r/DestinyTheGame (new)\n\n149 - /r/civ (new)\n\n151 - /r/KerbalSpaceProgram -59\n\n155 - /r/Guildwars2 (new)\n\n161 - /r/Smite (new)\n\n163 - /r/2007scape (new)\n\n165 - /r/Planetside -46\n\n198 - /r/DarkSouls2 \n\n*Out:*\n\n/r/battlefield3 (169-&gt;

As of now, the post has 3,649 points with a 92% rating, which is pretty high for an AMA. I figured it must be a good one, so I decided to read some of it.\n\nI was surprised to find that the comments in the thread have relatively few upvotes for what seems to be a popular post. The top comments only have a little more than 300 points, and the scores drop quickly as you scroll down the page. It looks like an AMA that didn't get much attention, yet somehow the post itself was highly upvoted and was kept on the front page all day.\n\nFor comparison, see [Pierce Brosnan's AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e3av7/pierce_brosnan_keep_it_simple_actor_activist/) from the other day. 3,617 points with a 92% rating, very similar to the Lightfoot AMA. But the top comments in that thread have a few thousand points, which I would expect to see in such a popular AMA.\n\nSo why did Lightfoot's AMA seem to be popular on the outside, while the content within got so little attention? Did users upvote the post because he mentioned Elvis in the title, then they got bored by the comments and left without upvoting anything else? I don't understand the disparity here.",

        "title": "What is the appropriate timing for an AMA with a band/musician that will maximize exposure and perceived quality?",
        "author": "astarkey12",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2e3qbp/what_is_the_appropriate_timing_for_an_ama_with_a/",
        "text": "In /r/music, we work with Victoria of reddit on scheduling and coordinating AMAs that are taking place in the sub, and recently, we were discussing with her the pros and cons of timing in the sense of when the question answering actually begins in comparison to when the thread is initially posted. For example, this is /r/IAMA's guidance on the topic:\n\n&gt;The moderators suggest that you post your thread link no more than 15-30 minutes prior to your schedule AMA time. This is more than enough time for redditors to start populating the thread with questions. Then, when you’re ready to start, you can jump right in to answering questions. Also, this is helpful for social media sharing / promotion – you need the actual thread link to be live to direct followers.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;Time your AMA. Don't start right away; wait a few minutes for bad questions to filter down and good questions to filter up. But don't start too late, because then you get \"Why isn't OP answering questions??? RAMPART!\" And set aside enough time to answer enough questions. I would recommend waiting 15 to 30 minutes to start answering\n\nI've noticed that many of our music AMAs don't follow this rule and often leave several hours between posting the thread and answering questions. For example, [the Joyce Manor AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2e04dy/hi_were_joyce_manor_from_los_angeles_california/) was posted at 1:54 PM EST yesterday, and they didn't start answering questions until 6 PM EST. The reasoning behind the 4+ hour gap is simply a matter of convenience. By allowing that much time to pass after the thread is posted, the votes have time to sort out the \"best\" questions, and the situation where a late-comer question rises to the top after the artist has stopped answering is avoided. They can just come in, answer all the top-level comments and maybe a few follow-ups, then head out.\n\nDespite that, I don't believe the most convenient route amounts to maximization of exposure or quality. By doing it this way, the opportunity for follow-up questions is reduced, and the responses generally receive less attention than if they were made sometime closer to when the thread is posted.\n\nI made this post because I think we could deliver a better product with these AMAs - most of the musicians that host them don't have universal name recognition like a [Mark Hoppus of Blink 182](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/pdluf/hi_my_name_is_mark_blink182_hoppus_on_music/) type where timing is almost a non-issue due to overwhelming popularity, but the middle-of-the-road artists would benefit from improved timing. \n\nWe're also tailoring music-specific AMA guides for /r/music and /r/listentothis, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/music/wiki/amaguide) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/wiki/amaguide), respectively. In making this post, I hoped to nail down what the appropriate timing is so every musician (and their management) is properly informed going into the AMA - we currently have it worded like this for both guides until a better conclusion is reached:\n\n&gt;Please do NOT post your thread more than 2-3 hours ahead of answering questions because users will get impatient that you are not answering questions, and the post will fall off the front page before anyone can actually see the answers to the questions. This is more than enough time for redditors to start populating the thread with questions. Then, when you’re ready to start, you can jump right in to answering questions. Also, you need the thread to have been officially posted in order to share a link on your social media accounts. \n\nThese guides haven't been provided to artists yet as they were only recently drafted, so the wording right now is more of a placeholder as we make revisions and get feedback. Unfortunately, I don't have much hard data on this issue, and everything I've described is my perception as a mod and consistent reader of these threads. So, where is the perfect balance, and how can we deliver a higher quality AMA to the subscribers in this aspect? The end goal is to make the experience as beneficial as we can for all parties involved, so any suggestions, feedback, etc. is greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: One thing Victoria mentioned in our talks with her was that the bands are extremely grateful for the convenience of waiting a few hours, but there must be some way to convey to them the \"you get out what you put in\" aspect of AMAs.
