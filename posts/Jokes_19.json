As he approached him, he could see the reflection in his boots. His eyes widened as he stared up at the soldier's chest full of medals and combat ribbons. He tried to speak, but he couldn't. Finally, he took a deep breath, and managed to say, \"Excuse me, Sir. Are you an Airborne Ranger?\"\n\nThe Ranger replied with a thunderous voice, \"Why yes, I am!!
