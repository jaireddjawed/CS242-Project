I’m sure there’s a few more i can’t remember that i once wrote down, but i want to see if anyone knows anymore i may not have heard of outside of the youtubers who do video essays of off beat movies.\n\nMaybe its because if a movie does over use of color now it doesn’t have that same effect so that’s the reason why these older movies that never really became mainstream did it so well? But it’s hard to find these movies because i feel alot of them are also maybe foreign films? (House comes to mind).",

As a child born in Spain, I originally watched this movie in Spanish and I recall rather clearly that the movie's opening song was Walking On Sunshine by Katrina &amp; The Waves (a quite nice song if I may add).\n\nIn an attemp to rewatch this childhood favourite, I only found it in its totality in English and Latin Spanish (Spanish  spoken in South America, which is a different dub). Both have a song called Summer Sunshine playing in the opening. I managed to find however a clip of the opening of the Spanish dub (Spain's Spanish) in which you can indeed hear Walking On Sunshine.\n\nIdk if this is the right place for this but I'm just curious about the studio's decision of not including what I've learnt is the original soundtrack \"Summer Sunshine\" in the Spanish version and replacing it with a classic like \"Walking On Sunshine\".",

However, does it really count if 2 of the killers are completely and utterly ineffectual and one of them delivers his lines so hammily as to be utterly hilarious instead of scary. Decent enough motive but identities and motive were telegraphed in the first 10 minutes. \n\nTruth be told, it was a decent film with a lot if good kills, excellent acting from its leads and excellent pacing. But it was completely derailed by its final act with the aforementioned useless killing squad and the fact that they didn't put up much of a fight (or any fight whatsoever, let's face it) and they're kills were just stupid.

Rope by Alfred Hitchcock is a good but not perfect example, where the characters are getting more and more stressed due to the possible discovery of their crime. Definitely movies in the film noir vein !   \n\n\nNOt as interested in movies where the protagonist is just normally guilty about something (in bruges, manchester by the sea) but specifically where they're in danger of being found out.",

They sometimes show seemingly random films that aren't related to a new release or the season eg Christmas or Valentine's Day and are not experiencing a significant anniversary so for example recently they played Donnie Darko and Legally Blonde. (If anyone on the inside at Odeon knows why they sometimes do their so I would love to know because my best guess is it's a staff competition and the prize is that they get to choose a film to be shown on the big screen.)",
