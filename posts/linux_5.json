That said, GNOME is very heavy and I would like something lighter. I would like the option of having a full screen app launcher which is installable separate from the DE itself, so even if I install something lighter like XFCE I could still get my preferred style of app menu. I'm a very visual person and I like to see my apps displayed graphically rather than listed vertically in a windows-style start menu. Most of the results I get when I search are for generic app launchers like Albert and ULauncher, which are not what I'm after at all.",

I always kept a windows drive in my PC as backup and if I ever needed to use a program that only worked in windows. \n\nFast forward to about 2020, I installed Arch and used it and windows for close to 2 years. Then, in my complete brilliance, I managed to accidentally delete my home directory (pure stupidity) WHILE I WAS MAKING A BACKUP OF IT. Anyway, that got me to decide to do a deep clean of my PC, both physically and digitally. I decided I wanted to try something new, so I decided to do a complete swap over to PopOS as my new daily OS, and I deleted and removed my windows drive from my Pc. \n\nI’m amazed how quick and easy installation of PopOS was, and I had everything configured and ready to go in under an hour. Here’s to a fresh start! 🥂",

What are the gotchas should I be aware of?\n\nThe work is about devops. Various CLI on terminal, web browser, IntelliJ, VSCode, communication tools Slack, Zoom, Teams. \n\nThe machine is an HPE workstation z840 + a low end AMD Firepro W2100 graphics. It is currently working fine. With some minor annoyances \n\n- Sync of Gnome calendar is not very good\n- The notification tray is unreliable\n- The system update with many different paths is a bit confusing: the `sudo app update` I do manually some times. Software Updater app, and from time to times, Gnome pops up a screen notifying system update. Snaps apps seems to have a different life cycle.\n\nWith time I accommodate to these. But one thing that annoys me the most is the Gnome theme where every window is the same color (dark in my case). I find confusing to distinguish overlapping windows. I prefer the old style where the windows have a colored titlebar, with the windows in focus having a brighter color titlebar. I do use Gnome custom theme where I edited the `gtk-3.0/gtk.css` to force the color on the titlebar. But I find this hack tiring.\n\nAnother annoyance are the snap apps. I don't mind the slow start time. It's just that their update is not convenient (must close the app to update). And worst yet: on my playaround Kubuntu 22.04 machine, each time the snap app is updated. The taskbar shortcut no longer works, and the app starts fresh losing its former config (Firefox, Bitwarden are the most notable)\n\nAs this is a work machine, I would like to lower the migration risk as much as possible. I would make a few rounds of practice with KVM before going for a real switch.\n\nWhat I am looking for are the showstoppers issues such as multi-monitors (2 have two identical Dell 27\"), audio, webcam, troubles like making screenshot, drap drop files from app1 to app2, etc.\n\nAlso this is going to be my first time trying Debian. I wonder if the installer is OK with UEFI boot mode, Secure Boot, LUKS encryption works OK with custom partitions (/efi/boot, root, /home).\n\nThanks you very much for any advice.",

Is there a linux solid state distro that boots from a harddrive that can be unplugged at a moment's notice and restarted without risk.  I am imagining a machine with a ram drive that loads all config and userspace and one can run a command to update changes to a template profile on the system.

Dash no  longer looks glorious, it's flat because that's \"modern cool flat look\"  (basically just for the sake of being flat i think), flat desing can be  good, but it's poorly implemented. The wallpapers that they ship is  nowhere near the official ubuntu wallpapers, same goes to their theme  and icons.  \nAlso I think that Ambiance theme looked much better on  Unity than Yaru theme: improving Ambiance would be a much better move  than moving to Yaru IMO.\n\nI'd love  to go back to Unity desktop, I like its way of doing things so well. But  because of the way it is kept now I can't really do that. Don't get me  wrong, I respect the their efforts: the fact that there is a person who  decided to bring it back to life is very cool. That being said, it's  still not so polished in terms of bugs and usability (last time I tried  was 22.04).\n\nI think making it more  usable and fixing bugs (and maybe porting it to other distros) is a  much higher priority than new features. I miss Unity, yet I hope that  some day in the future it will become what it needs to be. It's truly  incredible that some 13y.o kid has gone this far.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it possible. Is my critique valid?",
