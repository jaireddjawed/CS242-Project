        "text": "I guess I was in the right mood or something but \"Behind The Sun\" by Odesza hit me hard recently. Anyone know of similar songs they would recommend? I don't want any \"Good vibes\" or \"chill\" type shit. I want something that's kinda powerful but with futility if that makes any sense. (The following is unnecessary background)... I dunno, I have been in a real rut lately with music to listen to. I usually listen to anything from Death, Thrash, and Prog metal to EDM, Pop, and Trap. I haven't been able to find anything new that I like and don't want to go down the dusty road of listening to old stuff (I have heard enough of that shit). I was super excited for the new Periphery album but either that shit is not for me or it hasn't hit me in the right frame of mind yet. C'mon help!",

I was very insecure about other guys checking my girlfriend out and talking to her, even if they were her friends. It made me wonder, why don't I get the same reaction from other girls? I decided to write my experience down and turn it into a song that people can relate too. \n\nIf you enjoyed my original song, it would be helpful if you would give me a like or follow to help me grow as an artist.
