        "text": "So, this isn't the most unexplainable story maybe, but i think it was kinda interesting. \n\nThis happened near my parents' house, three years ago. They live in a neighbourhood located in the outskirts of our city, a few blocks away from their house it's just unpopulated fields. It's near the beach, a lot of houses aren't permanently occupied since they are just vacation homes, so, you don't really see lots of people on the street during winter.\n\nMe and my  then gf went to buy some groceries, and we were heading back to my parents' house when we both saw a large black dog, extremely dark but shiny short fur, big and muscular but skinny (i don't really know much about breeds, but it's body was kinda like a greyhound but bigger and more muscular). Before we said anything about it, we both got the same feeling, as soon as we saw it we were extremely creeped out by it. It kind of gave off this weird evil vibe I guess. There was something about it that felt off. Something about the way it moved felt kind human but also fiendish, I couldn't stop looking at it. We looked at each other and i guess our facial expressons confirmed that we both got them same weird feeling about it and continued walking back to the house, now at slightly faster pace and talking about what we just saw. I guess, yea, you could say it was just a creepy looking dog, but i feel that doesn't completely explain the sensations i felt looking at it. I don't think i would normally get that feeling just from a weird dog, I'm not a strong believer in the paranormal and she wasn't either, and I'm not normally creeped out by animals, but that dog emanated some kind of evil energy or something i guess, and we both felt it.\n\nWhen we got back home, we started telling my mom about what we saw. I thought we would probably sound like madmen talking about some evil devilish dog and that she would just laugh.\n\nExcept, she also saw it. It was a few days earlier I think, she was alone at home at night. She heard some noise coming from the yard. At first she thought it was her dog, until she realized her dog was laying on the couch inside. She then saw this black blur run past the window, and when she opened the door, there it was. As soon as the dog saw her, it ran towards the front of the house and jumped over a 1,60m (5,24 ft) tall gate without even grazing it, and ran off.\n\nShe also got this weird feeling when she saw it, and was shocked about how it could just run towards a pretty tall gate, jump and continue running, so fast and so smoothly. She said at first she didn't understand what had just happened and thought she was going insane lol.\n\nShe never saw that dog around again, and i never saw it either any time i went to visit them.\n\nSo, yeah, i guess you could say it was just a creepy looking extremely athletic dog, but it felt like something else. Some time later I read about the black dog legends from english folklore and it seemed kinda similar, no glowing eyes tho, that would've been cool :( (I'm Argentinian, i had never heard of those legends, I originally related the experience to The Hound of the Baskervilles, which apparently is inspired by those legends). I understand they can be bad omens, guess that explains me and my ex-gf's break up a few months after we saw it lol\n\nSo, I posted this because I was wondering if anyone else had any weird experiences involving strange black dogs, or cool stories related to those legends.",

        "text": "I remember in kindergarten one day I kept running down the hallway and jumping and belly flopping on to my bed while thinking I want to and can fly like peterpan and superman. I must have done this dozens of times and I distinctly remember on my final attempt jumping towards my bed and then rising to the ceiling and flying around the room for about 2 to 3 times in a circular motion and then had the thought how is this possible and immediately fell from the ceiling onto my bed. This wasn't a dream or an astral projection nor was I on any type of medication. It was 30 seconds to a minute of being in the air. \n\nIm 38 now and I still trying to wrap my mind around it. The movie What the Bleep deals with quantum physics and the power of thought and is the closest explanation that I have found besides reading other peoples stories of levitation. Eric Clapton's son thought he could fly like Superman and jumped out a skyscraper to his death and Clapton then wrote the song tears in heaven. \n\nIt hasn't happened since but I do have reoccurring dreams of levitation and in my dreams when I question how this is possible I then wake up. I know this is way off but what if our DNA is like an embedded algorithm and you get certain quirks from your ancestors experiences. I'm supposedly a descendant of Paul Revere and my grandfather was in WW2. What if traumatic experiences help shape evolution in humans. I hear about people who shine and from a logical perspective you can pass them off as crazy but maybe telepathy, telekinesis, or levitation has actually occurred. Moses supposedly split the red sea but that's supposed to be from the power of god. What if X-Men wasn't far from the truth. I don't know if it was before or after the incident occurred but my dad's friend professionally drew Wolverine for marvel comics and stopped by to visit and drew me a Wolverine real fast which was really cool of him. As a substitute teacher kids are stunned when they see me kinda like in the movie kindergarten cop and they randomly call me Beast and Thor.",

        "text": "      I used to live in a home that was old. This house backed up to the woods, lake, and other places to explore as a little kid. Everything was there for a kid. Anything you could ask for. But there was one thing that bothered me the most, the secret door in my room. \n\n  I am going to try and paint a picture for you. \n\n\n     There was a white picket fence that you would walk into. After opening the door you would head into the main entrance. Looking inside the house from the main door you would see a staircase that was going upstairs in front of you. Walk upstairs and there would be the split - left to right - guest room 1 - bathroom, guest room 2, guest room 3. \n\n    I grew up in the 3rd room. \n\n    Inside this room it was stained wood everywhere. Ceiling, wall, and floor. There were 2 windows. Everything creaked and made a sound. You knew exactly where to walk not making sound. \n\n    One thing in this room bothered me. There was a closet, with shelves. You had to open this door to see it. Under the bottom there was a loose fitting board. If you moved it there was a hole. Inside this hole was crawl space and a lot of it. Apparently the parents found notes inside this crawl space and told me nothing about it until I was older. They just said, “We found notes.”\n \n\n This creeps me out just typing this. I can feel my hair standing up. When I was younger I felt my bed shake. I hardly slept because my bed was shaking at times. All I could think about was the door in my room. Keep in mind this whole room was wood everywhere. It was the only room like that in the house. I would have dreams and horrible dreams. \n\n  One night I would have a dream of the door opening and I was lifted off the bed. There was a black cloud and red eyes watching me. This cloud would bring me outside my room. I would try and run down the stairs but was thrown back up the stairs. All in a slow motion. Once I would wake up the bed was shaking. Not from me shaking the bed. The bed was shaking. A wooden bed was shaking in a wooden room. It was a horrible sound. \n\n  This happened over and over. To this day I do not like talking about it. I do not believe in ghosts but I think back to this moment and question everything sometimes. \n\nWhatever was in that room didn’t not want me there. \n\nI am glad to be out of it.",

        "text": "Ill start by saying to not be afraid when you read this stuff. Ive barely noticed any weird things in the last few years but its started up a little after finding this sub. Seems the more i think of these things and feel fear and paranoia, these things start happening again. Seems to me the best way to approach these things is to not feel any fear at all. Hell, idk why im still even on this sub but i figure i could finally share my experiences with people who'll understand what i went through.\n\nIll start from my childhood until now (im 27)\n\nOne of my earliest paranormal experiences i can remember was waking up at night seeing my blanket slowly being removed from me. I grabbed the blanket and held on as tight as i could. I didnt want to yank the blanket up as i wa afraid some monster at the end of the bed would jump up with the blanket. Somehow while this was going on i instantly fell asleep.\n\nSome time later, maybe a couple of years i was sleeping in a different house and woke up to the same thing. Exactly as before i held the blanket with all my strength and then instantly fell asleep.\n\nOne night i ran into my great grandmothers bedroom to get something and i saw a whole bunch of shadow people. Completely black human shapes just standing there. I freaked out and ran out of there.\n\nI used to sleep in my great grandmothers bed with her as a child, and woke up in the middle of the night, noticing she was gone. I got scared and looked around the room. In two corners of the room where gray see through men in suits just standing there emotionless. There was a dresser in one of the corners so one of these figures had his lower half going through the furniture. I looked out of the room to the living room and saw my great grandmother sleeping there. In the hallway leading to the living room was a massive shadow of an old man walking with a cane. I sprinted past it and woke my great grandmother up and begged her to come back to bed with me. When we went back to the room it was back to normal.\n\nI woke up one night to the sounds of walking in the attic. It sounded like someone with heavy boots on.\n\nOne morning i was half awake in bed shuffling my feet around lost in thought, and heard a small bang on the closet door. I stopped moving for a few seconds, then went back to it. Heard a louder bang, went back to moving my feet around and then a very loud slam on the door and i ran out of there.\n\nIn my dads apartment, we were watching a movie one night when the voice of a girl whispered my name directly into my ear.\n\nI was at a cottage with my family, sharing the bed with my sister. She woke me up freaked out looking at a shadow of a side view of a bald man on the ceiling. You know how lamp shades create a circle of light on the ceilings? The shadow of the head was in the light. Somehow once again i instantly fell asleep.\n\nThe next year we were back there, and my other sister was sleeping in a different room. In the morning she told us she saw the same exact thing in her room. She never believed in any of this stuff so i knew she wasnt just playing around.\n\nYears later i was in the pool with my sister at my great grandmothers house. I saw the exact same shadow on the side of my neighbors house. We screamed and ran inside. Thats the last time we saw anything like that.\n\nNot much happened then for like 10 years. In my teenage years things started a little bit then when i was around 16 things escalated like crazy.\n\nAround 13 years old i was sitting in the basement on my computer when i suddenly felt extremely paranoid and it became very quiet. I turned around and saw the gray see-through figure of a man in a suit. As soon as i saw it it disappeared. Whats very strange about that is that it was only his top half floating in the air. I think this thing showed itself to me like that to tell me it was the same one i saw as a kid in the bedroom, where i could only see its top half.\n\nI didnt spend much time in the basement after that lol.\n\nAround 16 i became religious. One time i was praying in the basement and when i opened my eyes i saw an orange orb that disappeared as soon as i saw it. The best way to describe it is like a mini sun, with what looked like energy around it.\n\nI started hearing constant cracking noises on the walls and ceilings. You can try pushing against your wall and youll hear cracking, might not depending on what kind of walls you have. But its the same sound. \nI was in my bedroom reading scripture one night when i heard cracking on the walls in the hallway outside my room, coming closer to me then into my room. \n\nI was trying to sleep one night when i heard what sounded like something slithering on the walls with claws. Another night i could hear something shuffling in a box of books next to my bed. Another night i was in the bathroom and heard something moving in the laundry basket directly behind me but nothing was there.\n\nOne night i was in the bathroom and told myself \"im going to take a bath\" and the voice of a girl whispered behind me \"ok\".\n\nOne night i was reading scripture in my room when i heard a very loud slam on the ceiling above me. This happened a second time in the living room. \n\nAt this point i thought i might be going crazy but my great grandmother was literally woken up by the slams on the ceiling.\n\nOne day i was in the living room with her talking anf we both heard a girl scream in the basement. My great grandmother asked me what the hell that was and somehow i just shrugged it off without a care. Ii guess by this point it didnt bother me too much anymore. Another morning we both heard slamming on the door leading to the garage. No one could have done that.\n\nOne day i was in the basement and heard the cracking sounds on the walls, wood, anything around me. Something was flying around me.\n\nThings slowed down from there. \n\nIn 2013, my great grandmother passed away, i became very depressed and suicidal and moved in wjth my sister in a different province to get a fresh start. My dad would come to my great grandmothers house every day to renovate. He once randomly told us the house was haunted, that he arrived at the house and saw a ball of light flying in the house. He went in to investigate but nothing was there.\n\nLiving with my sister things became much worse. It wasnt just noises or seeing things, now it became a spiritual attack. \n\nOne while i awake lying in bed, the image of a shadow of a man with horns and goatee just flashed in my mind. At night id be trying to sleep, having my eyes closed and id see faces in the darkness, monsterous things like black evil angels or horror movie looking faces. I realized that if i kept my light on this completely stopped. Still to this day at age 27 i sleep with the light on.\n\nI had a nightmare where an evil being in a black hood was standing over me next to my bed. It grabbed me causing some kind of electrical shock throughout my body. I woke up mid shock still jumping in bed.\n\nI started hearing what sounded like drumming on my walls. Very fast tapping? I guess that would describe it. One day i noticed my name had been carved into the wall next to my bed. But only the first half of my name. The rest was gibberish. \n\nMy sister had a nightmare that i was standing in front of a mirror with a serpents tongue, and that she was at my funeral. \n\nI was seeing orbs constantly at this point in different colors. The scariest was when i was talking with my elderly landlord when suddenly i looked at him and black orb was floating over his forehead. Thats the only time i saw a black orb.\n\nI stupidly tried to get into third eye crap and Buddhism, trying to meditate and connect wjth the spiritual realm while all this madness was happening and it got even worse. One day i saw writing forming on my window in some unknown language. My mind was a complete mess.\n\nI ended up becoming religious again which saved me from my suicidal thoughts and saved my life. Things got better after that though i still saw those evil images in my mind if id try to sleep with the light closed.\n\nI ended up moving back to my hometown in 2015 and things really calmed down since then. \n\nEvery now and then id see an orb or hear the cracking. \n\nNothing really happened until a few months ago. I woke up and at the end of my bed was a gray see through boy. Again as soon as i saw it it disappeared. I really didnt give a shit and just fell back asleep.\n\nNow recently i found this sub and the cracking noises have increased a bit. I guess because reading these stories makes me afraid and paranoid. So ive got to control those emotions or just avoid this sub entirely.\n\nAnd thats pretty much it.",

Thoughout the movie a song played and I kept tearing up and I wasn't sure why. By the end of the movie I realized it was a remix of a song that played throughout the Lost Boys. The name of the song Cry Little Sister. Once I connected the dots, I had a good cry and said hi Dean (my brother) I hope you enjoyed the movie with us. I have never heard that dong other than in The Lost Boys movie. \n\nDoes anyone else believe in \"signs\" that their loves one's send them ? Please share ..  \nI have so many",

It's not the most exciting story, but it's one of those things that absolutely happened in plain sight and consciousness but defies logic and reason; and it creeped the heck out of me. \nI always wake up in the middle of the night, every single night. It's not a big deal because I usually fall right back asleep but last night I woke up around 2:40 ish and couldn't fall back asleep right away so I decided to just scroll on my phone a little before I dozed off again. \nI have two windows in my bedroom but both were closed (it's getting colder), so there was no draft of any sort, no fan, completely still and completely silent until suddenly in the corner of my room I hear the sound of items shuffling and the sound of an item hitting the back of my mini fridge. I have a junk pile of things on a long desk in the corner of my bedroom and they were not at all set up in a way that would make anything fall over in any way. It just didn't make sense how those could have been moved around without anything touching it.\nIt is one of those moments when you sit there dumbfounded and think \"did that seriously just happen?\" Like there is absolutely NO rational reason why this would happen. No pets in my room, no wind, nothing. It honestly kind of freaked me out but I didn't allow myself to dwell or get too scared over it. I said a quick prayer and turned on my laptop to fall asleep to videos for a light source.\n\nThis exact kind of thing has happened before in this room and I just can't explain either instance away. It makes no sense and makes me feel like there could be something but otherwise I never feel scared down here or like there's a presence. But I just wanted to share this because it is fresh with me. I'm no stranger to a few other paranormal happenings but like this, they are unexplainable and kind of smaller things that happened. Except for one of them but that's for another time.",

It went something along the lines of hoping she is at peace and that she is no longer in pain, and that we miss her here in this world.\n\nThe next morning at 5:55 am, I got a call from my mom. She asked me why I was calling her, and I asked why she was calling me. Neither of us made the call. Confused, we hung up and went about our days. When speaking to her about it today, she was confused how it happened since it showed outgoing call on her end, but her phone was in her purse as she was leaving to go to work. She then mentioned that she took it as a sign that her mom (my grandma) was giving us both a call to say she was okay. Unsure what the time 5:55 means but we both thought it was a bit eerie.",

One day I was walking along the hallway and passed my parents room. The door was open, the lights were off, and the room was pitch black (no light from the hallway emanating inward). I found myself looking into glowing green eyes at my eye level. I stood there frozen for what likely just a moment, but it felt long. I felt a sense of terror and ran away crying down the stairs to my mom who was dismissive. We didn’t have any pets, my dad was working, and both my brothers were in school. I never saw them again.

One night I’d dream it’s my mom, the next night it’s my brother. And then a week or two later we get a call that an uncle died. \n\nIn February I choose to cut contact with my real dad, he’s always been manipulative, controlling, using threats to get his way, obsessive. I needed to get out of that. Since then I’ve felt free, he was a burden in my life and I was (sometimes still am) scared of him. \n\nA month or two ago I started getting a gut feeling, and started questioning, what would I do if he died? It would obviously fall on my shoulders to arrange the funeral and stuff. I had a very strong feeling he would die soon. And I know it sounds sickening, but it gave me a comforting feeling, like I would finally be free.\n\nThe feeling passed, I didn’t think about it at all for a while, and since a week it started again, now also with dreams that he’s in critical condition in the hospital, and my guts are telling me he’s not living much longer. \n\nI don’t want to get back in contact with him to see how he’s doing health wise, when I cut of contact he still used emotional abuse, trying to make me believe he always was a good father and I was a bad daughter for abandoning her dad like that. \n\nSo I don’t really know what to do with this, I’m fairly new to getting into contact with my spirit guide, is there a way I could find out how he’s doing without actually getting into contact with him? \n\nSorry for the long text, it’s just a lot that I needed to get off my chest.

My mother saw a UFO, although this was across the state and many decades ago.  \n\nI've never actually seen anything. I can't tell if this is because it's just not my time or because I'm rather daydreamy. I wonder if a ghost could walk right on by and I wouldn't even notice. I'm also the one who's read most about these things. Sure I'd jump out of my skin if an alien came by to say hi, but man do I long for something of my own. Something not scary tho... maybe they watch me and see how jumpy I am and say \"oh no, I don't want to haunt her, she screams at the slightest jump scare on TV.\"\n\nThoughts?

        "text": "Hello, I [25x] just want to start this by apologizing for the long story ahead. It's just been a series of instances that have been itching my mind and last night was just another experience that seems very sus. \n\nI currently live in my parents house while they live in another state. I grew up in this house, we always joked about there being a ghost being around us. It started in the house we were in before this. There were orbs and cold spots and shadows, even a couple times where my phone had disappeared and reappeared in the closet. I was yound enough at the time to think 'well maybe I did lose it in there' if it weren't for the strange recordings put on the phone after each time. If I can find the phone and record the recordings I'll put them on here for you. In that same house I took two photos of my cousin, one perfectly normal, the other with a man in the mirror behind her behind me. I'll add those to this post. [Edit: I can't figure out how to add photos? Are they not allowed in this reddit? Oh well]\n\nYears later and I'm now in this new home living on my own with my two partners and there is some very suspicious things happening about the house. It began with things just going missing too often, never to reappear. There was a point where I woke up one night to multiple noises in the room like tapping the spines of the books, flicking the items on the headboard, tapping on the dresser, etc. And it really scared the shit out of me that time until it abruptly stopped. \n\nI cannot remember if this was before or after the ring was brought into the house. \n\nThe ring was given to us by a mortician friend of mine who had cremated this man one day. When they cremate someone they take off all jewelry and clothing, however when my friend cremated this one guy, he had found a melted family ring in the ashes. The family didn't want it so he took it home and eventually make it into our hands. We kept it in the house under the bathroom sink for a few months, but things kept disappearing and shit kept happening (rooms got trashed. Doors could open, etc) so we buried it in a ceremonial box outside in our strawberry garden beds. There has not been much activity since other than a shadow figure. Until now. \n\nHere's where the sleep paralysis comes in. I get sleep paralysis and the first few times having it in the house has been fine, but has gradually gotten worse. I'd hear lots of things like music or tambourines or clapping what have you. There was one time I was stuck in sleep paralysis and wanted to see if I could astral project for shits and giggles. I've done it before and I could recognize the feeling of it in sleep paralysis so I figured, what could go wrong? I got to the point where I was pushing myself up into a sitting position before an overwhelming force actually hit me in the face and knocking me completely out of sleep paralysis. I took that as a warning not to do it that night and accepted it and went back to sleep.  \n\nI have a few witchy friends who warned me the next day to not go into astral projection without protection so I took that to heart. A few sleep paralyses later I have one tonight. Tonight was particularly special because there were actually two distinct voices this time. \n\nSo there I was frozen in bed listening to the tambourines and plastic lids being thrown around the room (obv there was nothing actually happening this is sleep paralysis) but suddenly I heard this voice call out to me as if it were standing next to my bed leaning over me. I couldn't make out the gender but they sounded young like I am. They asked me questions I now don't remember but I could answer them through my own thoughts. This has never happened to me before in a sleep paralysis event. Ever. So I entertained the person. Eventually they brought up astral projection, but they didn't say those words. Again I don't remember exactly the words but they meant it. That's when I felt the heavy feeling of projection starting. It was so strong that I felt that if I did do it I would actually get somewhere. But they WANTED me to do it. I got suspicious and backed off. Told them no. Then the second voice chimes in, sounding furious and telling me to do it. This new voice definitely sealed my decision not to do it without protection.. an adult male, gruff voice. Very scratchy and somewhat elderly. Not at all like the younger voice. It took about an hour or listening to them beg for my projection before I could finally snap out of it and get up. I quickly created a sigil and drew it onto my hand and tried to fall back in, but it all completely went away. Silence. \n\nNow I want to know everyone's personal thoughts and experiences on the matter of paralysis and paranormal activity.\n\nI'm thinking of tattooing a sigil to my hand for the next time this happens because I want to know what they wanted from me. \n\n\nIn short: had sleep paralysis in a haunted home. They wanted me to perform astral projection which was very sus and then one of the two got very angry when I decided not to. Also sus. Drew a sigil on my hand and everything went away. Now I'm curious and want some answers. \n\nThank you for reading this far and that k you for your help. I hope I get some answers.",

I hadnt heard anyone come down the stairs so I looked over and I saw this dog type thing.

I got up and my dog got in frount of me, leaving the room after I turned the lights off he stayed behind me and waited for me to be half way up the stairs before he even started going up the stairs.

Afterward things felt better and calmer, but I was still nervous so I had my eldest niece stay with me(16.)\n     It was 2 am and she ran in my room crying saying she woke up to feeling like someone was running their hands up and down her legs. She said she could feel the full hand wrapped around leg going up and down. She said she began saying the Lord’s Prayer, and that’s when she heard someone whisper her real name in her ear. All of us call her “Booney” which is a nickname that started when she was a baby so it was very strange that it knew her real name. She slept in my bed for the rest of the night with all the lights on and my cats were at the foot of the bed alert with their ears up all night. \n  In the morning I investigated the guest bedroom, and all I could smell was a strange odor that smelt similar to urine. I have a picture of lighthouse that hangs on my wall in that bedroom and it was on the ground, the glass fully shattered. \n    We went out for the day running errands around dinner time we got home and my niece was cleaning up. Someone began banging on my front door and ringing the door bell over and over again, while banging on the door the same time. I looked out my window and no one was at the door Step or in the yard. My niece and I started to pray together and after a few seconds it stopped. \n  I can’t afford to move out, and I can’t keep staying away from my own home. Im trying not to be afraid, but I feel defeated. I know this is a lot but I promise im truthful, and don’t know where else to turn.

        "text": "This has stuck with me ever since I was a kid when it happened. I was resting in the car as my mom and brothers went into our local movie store with my eyes closed, it got pitch black in my eyelids, but I see something even blacker moving, it turns to look at me and then it meows and I see these eyes and white teeth in the blackness. I realize it’s a black cat and then I suddenly open my eyes as if the trance had broken. The entire way home I’m telling my mom and brothers to “Watch out for a black cat.” We get home and as I’m walking through the gate I notice something laying next to it in the grass, a dead black cat. I was freaked out and started crying, my brothers are weirded out and my mom is telling me to calm down because it’s just a random dead cat. \n\nStill no clue what or why it happened. I’ve had the odd dream come true every so often, also seen things but I was later diagnosed as schizophrenic in my life. But the black cat was real, my brothers and mom saw it.",

As I was looking around the room I noticed a man standing by the wall leading into the house. He was very handsome, longer hair, wearing a simple white robe, no shoes, he was glowing but had this stern look on his face. He never looked at me, not entirely sure he even knew I saw him - he had this warrior like facial expression that I recognized as stunningly handsome at pre-school age. Has anyone else has seen this man? \n\n# 2\nLater in life I saw two orbs dancing around one another (sighted them outside at nighttime). Upon staring at them in shock they started scanning me and my stepson who was the first to see these orbs and brought them to my attention. We both couldn’t deny what we saw and still cant explain it to others without being told it was just our eyes adjusting to light etc etc. What we saw was not an eyesight issue, it was as real as it gets! The orbs looked tadpole like in appearance and about the size of a baseball (cant recall the exact coloring unfortunately). What experiences have you had with sighting orbs?",

        "text": " \n\nI am a student, I am not very athletic nor am I in any way sporty but rather more of an academic, so when we had sports day qualifications at school for the first time in three years, I was forced to truly exert myself and I was fortunately able to win first place in the hundred metre sprint and qualify. I was quite proud of my victory but hated it just as much, I should have prepared beforehand by doing some stretches or warming up because the next day my body ached a lot. Despite the physical discomfort, went to school which was actually a lot of fun but we were forced to end the day with a practice march-past for the actual sports day next week. Which would have been fine had it not been 32'C (89.6'f) and if my body hadn't been aching and in retrospect I realized my throat felt somewhat constricted and I had some trouble swallowing. After school I went for a tuition which wasn't so bad because I went in my friends car and I was able to sit down during it, and I was able to find a taxi relatively easily.\n\nAs soon as I got home my father started getting ready to leave for the hospital for an appointment and my mother was already home out at the time visiting her sickly mother. However I wasn't alone at home, I had three cats my only complaint was that it was loud because my neighbors who lived directly above my house were renovating however all sound ceased at around seven or so and that is when things start to get weird.\n\nI was studying when I noticed I was feeling warm, so I went into my parents room and got a thermometer to check my temperature which read 100.7f. I did tell my parents because they had their own problems and instead decided to finish the chapter I was revising and then go to sleep and I had just sat down when I heard a peculiar sound. Before I go on I must confess I am a fan of short horror stories and being alone in the house at half past seven in the evening my mind began to wander and I entertained the idea of a ghost. Despite this I am a realist and instead tried to figure out what made the sound, it couldn't have been the construction workers doing renovations but it could have been my cats. Still, it was a peculiar sound it sounded like someone was tapping with their fingernail against wood with their pace increasing with each tap, I was sitting at a wooden desk at the time and I almost recreated the sound and a few seconds after I did I heard the sound again slighting louder than the one I made. For the second time I recreated the sound, this time what I heard was different, instead there were two taps maybe five seconds apart.\n\nMy mind began to race as I tried to consider each possibility but my churning grey matter formed a horrible thought. I was hearing the sounds coming from what sounded like my parents bedroom, in it the only wood was the bedframe, a table a display case and their cupboards which were up against the wall separating our rooms. They were made of wood. I stopped echoing the sounds and when I did or rather didn't they stopped but then I wanted to test, to see whether or not what I was hearing was still there and so I tapped recreating the first sound to which I was met with the creepiest of all the sounds I had heard that night. I was like somebody was rolling marbles against the cupboards, I immediately covered my eyes and began to recite what I was studying mentally whilst i was doing this, there were more sounds, like another tapping but this one sounded deeper (I don't know how else to phrase it). Eventually the sounds ceased and I opened my eyes and began to look around my room for my cats. One of them was on my bed, the second was somewhere around the house, and the third (who was blind in one eye) was sitting at my door looking in the direction of my parents room. It was only when I saw the third that I realized she was meowing more than usual that night despite her food and water bowls being full.\n\nMy mother came home soon after that and went into her room into which I followed her, noticing the third cat laying down in the hall. In her room I saw a pet toy in her room, it was plastic with a smaller plastic ball in it which made a sound when you shook, so I thought I had found the source of my sound. However as I was typing this, I began to realize that certain details do not add up, the toy was on the bed, not on the floor which wasn't wood and even if it was the ball, I doubt the cat could recreate the same sound twice and with the same toy and even deeper sound and the sound of rolling marbles.\n\nThis is the creepy part, this just happened about two hours ago, I want an explanation if anyone can give me one, please do. I swear I am not lying, I considered that perhaps I was hearing things because of my fever or maybe it really was the cat toy and maybe the third cat wanted affection from the only human in the house at the time, I don't know. Perhaps this is not the creepiest story on her, but it is most definitely true, I swear it. I just posted this on r/Creepystories and I know it is strange to ask a sub about the paranormal for a reasonable explanation but please give me one, I am not lying and am rather creeped out by this.",

We have prior experience co-founding paranormal research groups and have decided to turn our attention to our new project, e.c.p.r.\n\nWe are not your typical paranormal investigators. We do not take on a case with the immediate thought that someone is having a paranormal experience. We do whatever we can within our means to prove otherwise *before* investigating the experience as a paranormal phenomena. We are both in our 40's, we are both well educated, and we both have steady careers. We do not do this \"for fun\"; we do this because we genuinely want to help people with whatever it is that they are experiencing. We approach each investigation from a logical and rational viewpoint.\n\nWhere we are just getting our new project up and running, our purpose is twofold with our first post: 1) If you live in NB, NS, or PEI, and having a current experience that you can't explain or you want help in determining what is happening, we would love to hear from you. Initially, we will have a video meeting with you to hear more about your experience, ask questions and determine if an investigation is necessary. 2) We are looking to add 2-3 members to our team. In my next post, I will be listing criteria we are looking for in potential team members. The criteria may seem in depth and highly specific but again, we are not your typical investigators simply looking for anyone interested in the paranormal.\n\nWe are looking forward to interacting with the Reddit community!\n\nJill",

I was watching TikTok sitting alone when suddenly all the hairs on my body stood on end. I look around and see nothing, but can hear rocks being pushed around by something walking on them. \nI go back to watching TikTok when the sounds of the rocks start getting closer, within 30yards of me. I get a dangerous feeling. I start looking around and see a dark shadow moving slowly. It walked on all fours, and it's back coming up to my head while I'm sitting down. Once I notice it, it slowly moves behind a cabin out of my view. My first thought was someone's dog got out and was roaming.\nAfter roughly 4 minutes, I get the sensation of being watched again and look towards where I saw the creature. The creature bolts down by the river into some bushes, just 10 yards away from me. While it was  running, I caught a glimpse of it. It appeared fairly smooth, Grey, and moved quickly on all four legs. I immediately got up and moved onto the front porch of my cabin. \nAfter moving, I still had the sensation of being watched and everything in my body told me to go inside, so I did. I continually heard noises coming from outside the cabin the rest of the night. Did I see a skinwalker, or was it something else?",

The next time stuff happened I woke up to my dad screaming at me because I was being way too loud in the middle of the night when I had been asleep for hours. I saw other posts about people communicating with these spirits and stuff getting better so I went to the local Wicca shop for a pendulum. From the minute I started using it that thing would spin almost sideways and it said it was positive which I now know is wrong. I started giving offerings to it because I thought that would make it nicer but all it did was make it way worse. The last time I did the pendulum I felt tugging on the back of my shirt so I asked it to show it self nothing happened except for a door closing I kept yelling it until I got this extremely vivid vision of this black and yellow monster that looked like it had cut burnt hair and flesh and it’s eyes almost had this oil dripping out of them from its eyes which had like nothing inside I lost my shit and called my Christian friend to pray with me it’s kept getting noticeably worse and my parents are getting more and more upset to the point my dad threw everything out just for it to be where I left it after I got home from meijer. I called that friend over and we walked and prayed through the house he said this afghan blanket I had gotten wasn’t good so I took it to goodwill. The activity greatly decreased but I don’t know how to get any energy left out I feel so lost and don’t know what to do.",

There wasn’t any real reason I was so anxious when I went near them, they are completely normal stairs. I would always feel observed or as if there was someone with me. Their toilet were directly at the bottom of it and it got to the point where I would ask my mom to stand behind the door so I wouldn’t go alone.\nI’ve always expressed what I felt to my family but they never said anything at first. Years later when I was about 12/13 I spoke out about them again, saying something along the lines of “those stairs will be the death of me”. I had felt a presence behind me as I walked away from them and ran to the living room where my family was. That’s when my dad went “well dad didn’t something happened to grandpa there ?”, he answered “well he fell down those stairs and died so yeah”. Needless to say I hated them even more. \n\nBtw for those who would say they made it up : my grandpa had cancer which made him weak and not in the mood for that and my father struggled to come up with stories when I was a child so a ghost story ?

Maybe a prank, user error, or electrical malfunction? \n\nMy grandparents worked for a few theaters in Austin, Texas. One night there was maybe five of us left in the Paramount theater (venue +100 years old). I cannot remember the show we worked. A group of us were sitting talking in the main theater with just the house lights. Without any of us moving the stage lights come on, change colors, and move oddly around the theater. We call out and get no reply. Call out again still no reply but the stage lights turn off. My grandfather and I inspect the three story building. Leaving my grandma, another usher, and the usher’s granddaughter in the lit area in front of the sound booth on the first floor. Due to the balcony we could see them on the first floor from the second and third. Maintenance closet on first floor by women’s restroom is locked. When we checked inside the custodian’s cart was up and he had left. The projectionist had left for the evening. I think it was a movie screening so it required no one in the A/V black box. Found no one so we all left together creeped out and walked the usher to her car. \n\nI told myself it had to be a practical joke played on me by my grandparents. I never convinced myself. Fast forward I think about this happening once a week since I was maybe 12 or 14. Cannot be sure when it happened. Big mama was on home hospice this time last year. She had been barely able to speak,  but I had to ask or I’d never know. My memaw visibly shifted she was more alert and we had one of our last conversations. Memaw said the adults were terrified because they thought it was a break-in and they had no way to defend themselves or their grandchildren against intruders. Thankful it was just a friendly ghost, but still gives me a chill. She went on to explain the constant rotation of overnighters quitting or refusing to work alone. Due to their cleaning carts moving, footprints in freshly washed floors, cold spots, cigar smells, etc. Most long-term staff reported strange occurrences. She went on to pass a couple days later.",

If this is the wrong sub and be posted in r/ghoststories, i will do that.)\n\n\nThis is a true story. This was back in like 2017/2018. So, about a good five to six years ago. It happened when I was over at my cousin's house. We were just getting ready to go to bed. At the time I was putting covers on the couch to go to sleep, when my parent asked me to go do something.\n\n\nI go around the couch, and do the task at hand. Most of the time I walk looking down, so I don't pay attention to much. But this time I just happened to look up to see a little girl standing there. At the time, it was just me, my siblings, parent, cousin and auntie in the house. She didn’t belong on the family roster to say the least. \n\n\nI'm looking at her and she is looking at me. And I'm a little confused because this was my first time seeing an actual ghost. This was not what I normally see. Most of the time it’s just shadow people. The little girl had black hair that went to her shoulders and wore a white dress that went to her knees. She wasn’t that tall, and if i had to guess her age was around nine. Which is sad because she probably died young. I didn’t get to see her face because it was blurry looking. And what was weird is that her whole appearance seemed to be blurry. Like a flickering image or a very fuzzy picture that was illuminated (or is it translucent the word I'm looking for?)\n\n\nShe wasn’t there for long. As quickly as I saw her, she left rather quickly as well. If I had to guess again she just wanted someone to see her (like most things that i see).\n\nAfter she left, I asked my parents “did you see that?” And She says “See, what?” I then proceeded to tell her what I saw. And she tells me it probably was something there. She already knows that this is a natural occurrence for me seeing spirits.\n\n\nShe then proceeds to tell me that the apartment that my cousin lives in used to be a church…….\n\nAnd I'm like \"Huh, what!?\" after she told me that.\nWhich makes a whole lot of sense since I saw the little girl ghost. After staying with my cousin for a while I never saw her again. Only once she was seen.",

When I woke up I had blood all over my hands, face, and arms. I used to have very bad nose bleeds due to abuse and honestly maybe just having a sensitive nose. It's been over 7 years since I've had a nose bleed in my sleep. I'm honestly shook rn and have run around my house with sage half asleep and covered in blood. Tbh for a moment I was scared that I some how attacked my family in my sleep. Thankfully it was just me who was injured. Do y'all think that was just a coincidence or..........???",

        "text": "Hello everyone.  Here is a true ghostly incident I experienced.  \n\n   While working as a night dispatcher for an alarm company, I received a frantic call one midnight.  It was a janitor from an elementary school we monitor.  We spoke often.  In tears, she asked we send the police because an intruder was in the school.  This woman was hysterical.  My partner called the police as I stayed on the line with her.  I asked for a description of the intruder and where she was for the police.  She replied, \" I'm hiding under a desk in the main office!  This was serious.\n\n   In my seven years as a dispatcher, I handled bank robberies, guns to the face, break ins, arsons etc.  I never heard anyone so scared.  After calming her down, I asked her what happened.  This was her reply.\n\n  She was done for the night.  Alone in the building with all doors and classrooms locked.   \nShe was gathering her things ready to exit and set the alarm. The building was silent.  Strangely, she heard a metal garbage can rattling.  She looked to see a young, red-haired woman standing over a garbage can looking at her.   She was wearing a dress, pumps, a coat with a mink collar, and looked sad.  Her clothes seemed old fashioned.  My janitor friend said to the woman, \" Excuse me, but the school is closed; you must leave.\" The red-haired lady calmly turned down a hallway without saying anything.  The janitor followed close behind wondering who she was and how she got in.  As she turned the corner expecting to see the trespasser down the long corridor...... nobody was there!  She checked all the doors along the corridor all the way to the exit and all doors were locked.  Not to mention there was no sound of any door being opened in the quiet building.  Fear set in and she ran to call me.\n\n   The janitor began to cry and said... please send the police hurry.  I said, what do you mean, \"she wasn't there?\"  She replied through tears, \"There was nowhere for her to go!  I turned the corner, and she was just gone!\"     The police notified us they were outside, all doors were locked along the outside perimeter, and they wanted in.  This poor terrified janitor didn't want to leave the office.  I convinced her to let the officers in.  They did a thorough search and found no signs of entry or anyone. No one was observed in the vicinity.   The janitor quit and never called me again.  This was twenty-five years ago and there were no cameras monitoring the school at that time.   \n\nBackstory:  I later found out a young teacher employed at the school had taken her own life several years earlier and was rumored to haunt the facility.   \n\nThis was a true story, and the school is in Farmington, Michigan.  Hope you enjoyed this and were spooked.   Thanks for reading.",

I looked up, and there was something that looked like a blue spark, like the sparks when you plug something in an outlet except much bigger, or a Polaroid camera flash. I don’t think it’s electrical, because there are no plugs nearby and yes it happened under a light… but the light has a glass globe on it so I don’t think any spark could fall. It also happened lower than the light, literally right in front of our kitchen sink, and I don’t smell anything. After seeing it, it looked like it zoomed away toward the front door (past where I was laying) and I got goosebumps as it disappeared. I am a little frightened, or feel crazy.

She says she's a spirit who follows her around, and always shows up when things are difficult, or when someone is about to die. She looks exactly like my nan, pale with an olive skin tone, long, dark, wavy hair. My mom refuses to talk about the Lady, and will leave if anyone is talking about her. Nan has stated that the Lady was instrumental in finding her 1st husband's body after he passed away from home. \n\nI've never spoken about the Lady in a public forum, and haven't mentioned her to many people. It sounds wild, but I've seen the Lady multiple times, mostly from afar. Almost every instance has been a time when I've thought she was my Nan, but Nan wasn't actually around. \n\nGrowing up, my family lived next door to my Nan, on the same property. Our houses are separated by just a driveway, basically. I've usually seen the Lady over at my Nan's house from the house I grew up in. One of the most memorable times was when I was about 16, and my great-grandpa lived with Nan at the end of his life. I kept seeing who I thought was Nan through the big window in the kitchen, but quickly got a call from my grandpa asking me to help him to the bathroom. \n\nNan said she doesn't know who the Lady is, just that she's always been there. She wonders if the Lady might be her sister who passed at a couple of days old. \n\nI've not been able to really find much online in regard to similar stories, aside from things like banshees. I've been thinking about the Lady and feel like I've been seeing her in places that don't really make sense lately. I live about a 2 hr drive from my Nan now. Has anyone had any similar experiences?",

There was no way the girl could have gotten out of the cot because she had never even attempted it, she always banged on the cot when she wanted out and she would have fallen and hurt herself if she did get out. My grandma was downstairs and went up to see the girl but she wasn’t in her cot. My grandma searched the whole upstairs and found her in the bathroom, stood up leaning on the bath. \n\nAfter this my grandma didn’t think much of it and she went on with her day, until she went outside and talked with some friends. She told them what had happened. Both of them instantly blessed themselves (crossed themselves for Americans) and said a Hail Mary. My grandma asked what the problem was and the older of the two said to her. The last woman who lived in the house died of suicide in the bath. That chilled even me to my core listening. She asked what she should do and they told her to go to the parish priest. She did and she asked him about the house being holily cleansed which he did. \n\nThe one thing he made sure to tell her was this. “Nothing bad happened to the child” My grandma still hasn’t told the girl (my aunt) this story. She said after that she never left my aunt upstairs in her cot alone again.\n\nI did some research and apparently ghosts of women who died by suicide can try substitution. To free their soul but trap another. I wondered if the woman drowned herself in the bath which was common in suicide apparently. Was the spirit going to drown my aunt? The story has deeply shaken me unlike any other. I think what helps is that my grandma would never, ever tell a lie and I know it’s true. \n\nPlease tell me more if you know anything useful",

        "text": "So, I say this because I've had numerous experiences where I have been physically reminded that there are things I don't understand in this world and to pay heed to the powers they have.\n\nMy first experience, I have posted in another post about my experiences working in a Haunted hotel.  I was taking pictures in the 12th floor attic area, when I got the sensation I should not be doing that.  As I walked down the stairs, a little voice in the back of my head told me to be careful.  Later that day, I was pulling a big laundry cart through a door way, when somehow, my little finger got caught between it and the doorframe.  I had to wear a splint for a few weeks.  I apologizes to what ever was up there and took care not to record videos or take pictures.  \n\nA second time, was a little more my fault and I payed for it.  Nothing serious, just really unlucky that day.  I was feeling like something was messing with me and I told it to not be a little bitch.  Kept getting things thrown or knocked off my table as I worked that day.  I realized what I had said and apologized again.  \n\nThe third time, wasn't intentional on my part.  I was having a rough day because the previous shift dropped the ball on the job.  I made a comment to myself about whatever was there messing with them.  It didn't take too kindly to that.  I went down to the break room to check something on the computer and as I was going to sit down, it felt like the chair was just rolled out from under me just enough for me to slip and fall on my ass.  I was okay, quickly righted myself, and muttered that I wasn't being serious, but once again, said I was sorry.  \n\nSo, take heed from this story, when you think you are in a paranormal location or something is trying to get your attention, be respectful, be open minded, and be careful.",

I've seen figures that others didn't see and although it still scared me as a child, I never spoke about it since they left me alone.  \nHowever, these recent encounters have left me feeling completely drained and terrified.   \n\n\nMy family have all gone on vacation overseas and I'm the only one at home. I'm experiencing strange encounters like finding locked doors unlocked, noises downstairs when I'm upstairs, the feeling that I'm being watched constantly. I woke up last night in complete sweats and terror with every inch of my body alert. There was a huge rumbling noise in my ears which stopped the moment I woke up. My whole body is tingling and it's so intense it almost feels like a separate outer layer of skin. I check to see if I'm experiencing sleep paralysis but I can move my body. I sense something in the house.   \n\n\nI felt the same experience two years ago. I had previous horrible experiences of an evil presence which gave me absolute hell for months when I was alone overseas for work. This entity would wake me up at 3:30am on the dot every night and whisper threats and even scratch me. I would wake up to find the sharp digging of a knife(?) pressed against my neck and the presence right in my ear muttering about how if I made a noise it would slash me then and there. The worst part was it would follow me even if I travelled elsewhere. Didn't matter if there were people in the room with me, I would wake up at 3:30am to find it hunched over my friend's bed as if it was searching their faces to find me. It only disappeared after I was gifted a priest blessed protection charm that I kept it with me as I slept. (I know it sounds so stupid and cliche, trust me. I was the most surprised when it actually worked).  \n\n\nI am terrified this entity has somehow returned since I am alone in this home. I feel like one half of my brain is trying to reason with logic and tell me houses normally 'creak' and move like this. But the other half of my brain knows that there's simply no way to explain the way I feel. I feel like I'm losing my f\\*cking mind and no one believes me. I hate when people tell me 'it's just stress or you're imagining things'. Like that's supposed to do me any good when I experience these horrible things.  \n\n\nIt's so isolating to experience this by myself. I looked at myself in the mirror and I look like my soul has been drained. I feel so helpless.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, if anyone has time to read my story, I'd appreciate any help, thank you!\n\nI am currently here looking for anyone that might have knowledge or experience with identifying an supernatural haunting. This story's crux is my great-grandmother and her property. She lived to be 101 years old and in her final months, my older sister, who was the closest and oldest great grandchild of hers which there were 12 of at the time, began noticing that my great grandmother was more and more uncomfortable staying with herself. She began to try every way to prolong the time my sister spent with her and it was because she was supposedly scared of a certain woman in black. I'm not sure the exact extent of the haunting my great grandmother endured but I know she was a certainly healthy woman up until her final year or so when her health started to deteriorate and the sightings occurred.\n\nNow the second part to this story concerns my younger cousin and her family who recently constructed a house on my great-grandmother's property. My Uncle and Aunt decided to build a house on the property as it would be better financially for them so there is now effectively two houses on my now deceased great-grandmother's property. Less than a month ago, my cousin was having a nightmare in which she awoke with a stinging pain in her shoulder and when she finally awoke her shoulder was subject to 3 scratch marks. They were not deep enough to leave a scar or deep enough to cause bleeding however, the marks were clearly red. Whether it was coincidence or not, she felt terrified and she had never had anything like that occur before so it raised my eyebrow and the eyebrows of a few of our family members. Now my Uncle has also reportedly seen my great grandmother in his home, in **their** kitchen, standing still on Easter morning before we had our first Easter gathering there but it a positive so we believe dearly she is still with us helping us fight.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Hit enter on accident and posted too soon\\*\\*\\*\n\nnow the third and final part to this story, and the reason i decided to post today is because,  I had just been told two nights ago, that my uncle was informed by the neighbors of a sighting. Now these neighbors have lived here long enough to have become family friends with my family because of them being so kind to our family and our great-grandmother. So after some time, the neighbor decided to come forward and tell my Uncle that she has regularly seen, for some time now since their arrival in their new house, an all black witch with fangs who patrols and goes up and down the property of my great-grandmother's house at night hovering. Just typing this makes me feel sick and for some time now I myself have been down on my luck but not like before, it feels rather like a void around me and certain family members, could this be something affecting us all as a whole in real time? I'm not sure if anyone has had any similar experiences but I certainly feel like I am the only in my family who acknowledges the possibility that this is something that must be dealt with so as not to prevent leakage into our other aspects of life which I feel like it potentially has the power to do. Thank you for reading if you have.  \n\n\nsome more to add: after speaking with my mother, she'd told me of the lady in black and some of the things she said to my great-grandmother, a week before she passed, the lady in black told her \"you will go to the hospital and never come back, and your son will follow you\" she died that week and a week after that, my great uncle was diagnosed with late stage terminal cancer, he passed shortly 3 months later. He told my mother on the way back from the diagnosis \"I think that lady my mom was talking about was right.\" To me this seems more malevolent than a peaceful presence , as I said any help is appreciated. We are now currently looking into our options in terms of having someone qualified come out to bless the house accordingly.",

I astral project like most nights and I wondered around. I didn't go too far, in my opinion. I did this for a while until I decided It was time to go back. That's when I saw it. It was this large black mass of a thing. It had no facial features. The only detail that I could make put were the ram like horns. It looked down at me and said \"Get ready, it's coming.\" \nThat was it. I found my way back to my body. \nA few days ago though I had a dream. The figure showed up. This time it said, \"Always watching.\"\nI believe in different realms,demons...all that jazz, and I not too afraid when it comes to things like this, but this one kind of rattled me. \n\nP.s. it wasn't short...",

        "text": "Around one year ago, me and my friend decided to bring her Ouija board on a field trip. We were going to Greece to visit some of the museums and other typical historical things like statues, we were gonna have outdoor lectures on Greek mythology, etc.\n\nOur class was going to stay there for three days in a hotel somewhere, I genuinely forgot the name but I know it was somewhere at the end of the capital city. If anyone here knows which hotel I'm talking about, then good, I guess. As soon as our outdoor lecture was over, we were sent to our rooms. Three of us were staying together in one room: two guys and me.\n\nMy friend kept her promise and decided to visit our room that night with the board, and we began to play. Everyone was in except the second guy who basically went off to study on the balcony (this part of the story is important). So there was only one guy, my friend and I now.\n\nWe began the \"first round\" as my friend, who I will call May, called it. The guy was the first one to ask the board something, and he chose to ask a common question:\n\n„Are you a demon?”\n\nAnd then nothing happened, of course. We waited around five minutes before asking the second question, and I was the one that decided to ask the board, „Is there a ghost that would like to speak with us in this room?”\n\nStill, nothing happened and May suggested that we should leave the board because it was getting late, but the guy, who I will call Paul, and I refused. So then we made the most stupid mistake of our lives, we continue and started to threaten whoever was responding to us.\n\n„If you don't give us an answer, we will burn the board.”\n\nMay said that, and Paul looked petrified. Not because what May said shocked him, but because our hands were off the board by now yet the damn planchette was moving.\n\nI quickly stood up in fear and looked down at the board, which was in the middle of spelling something out. It just said:\n\n„No.”\n\nWhat I remember specifically is that it did not hover over to the no already written on the side, but it spelled out the word by itself. We said goodbye, closed the board, put aside the planchette and tossed it in my friend's backpack. She scurried away back to her room, terrified and pale.\n\nNot even ten seconds passed before the guy that went off to study on the balcony bursted into the room yelling that he just saw someone's leg falling from the floor above us and into the bushes. We told him what we did and he had what looked like a semi-panic attack.\n\nAfter that, we ended the night by going off to sleep. The next morning after we got breakfast, May convinced me and the other two guys to come with her to check if the \"leg\" was in the bushes after she asked the people above us (an elderly couple from Germany) if they dropped anything, and they happened to say no. \n\nSurprisingly, instead of a \"leg\" like the guy who studied described, we found an old, black torn-up boot that was around knee-length and looked really old. It was actually pretty big, and we assumed that it either belonged to a man or a woman with a bit bigger feet. \n\nWe never found out anything else about this strange occurance and when we asked the staff, they joked that the hotel may be haunted assuming we were just a bunch of lying kids that want to mess with them, I'm guessing. \n\nAnyone can explain this? Would appreciate if you tried to. \n\n",

My roommate was awake and watching a movie beside me in the same bedroom. So, as i was trying to sleep, and almost fell asleep, I felt something like a strong breeze of something pressing on my belly as hot as lava. \n\nIt was intensely pressing against my belly. I thought It had something to do with food poisoning and that I was going to die. There was no pain, but at that moment I was sure that the hot lava is melting my skin and I couldn't move a muscle. It just faded away and I came to and felt my stomach it was as usual in normal body temperature. Roommate was right beside me laughing, watching a movie. I told him What just happened and he said he didn't see any movement from me or around me at all. It's one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had. ",

        "text": "So I've just got home from a ghost tour of an old quarantine station near me and my mum bought me tickets for my birthday and it's hosted by a medium. I'll give you a rundown first and then add my spooky encounter.\n\nMum and I felt like the medium has lost her power because we felt super sceptical (mum and I have had heaps of paranormal encounters so we usually arent sceptics at all) and some stuff she said like stories sounded like BS or exaggerated at least. She is a legit medium though shes been on tv and helped with murder cases etc I just think shes lost her touch over the years.\n\nThere was like 15 of us so there were too many people for anyone to focus on any paranormal activity.\n\nAnd then she made us all sit and sing like 10 songs to try get the energy up to communicate and mum and I were like... they dont need that if they wanna be known they can just use other energy such as lights, phones, people etc\n\nSo anyway at the end while they were distracted we went off alone and we picked up MEGA negative energy\nLike it was way easier just us. We didnt need no damn medium\nAnd like behind the crematorium was a mini one for kids and she didnt take us there so mum and I were like screw this let's take ourselves and we felt a horrible feeling there too.\n\nBUT something spooky did happen to me\nWe were in one room and I was immediately drawn to it\nI felt drawn to the back left corner and was just chillin and I wanted to just hang out for some reason.\n\nThen mum decided to walk out and I went to follow but the door shut infront of me when mum walked out\nSo I'm like wtf and opened it and mums like wtf\nSo I went back in and it started closing again\n\nDid it twice and it was fine to open but then i walked in and out one more time and I was like ok I'm going and the door effin locked itself from the inside. I was able to unlock it but I was in a panicky rush to get OUT and fumbling all over the show. First we thought maybe the door was shonky and wouldnt stay open or something but it was open when we walked in and we ended up going back just by ourselves and looked through the window from the outside and the door stayed open just fine.\nI do have video footage I'm just not sure how to link it or whatever so lemme know\n",

Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nI used to work at a popular sandwich shop about nine months ago, and I frequently did closing shifts which meant I would spend 25 minutes or so alone. It always creeped me out- even with all the store lights on, I always felt I was being watched, but I never had anything happen until Christmas of last year. \n\nI got a text asking me to swing by the store and prep bread for the morning. No biggie, it wouldn’t take more than ten minutes. As soon as I walk in, I get this overwhelming feeling that I’m not alone. I brush it off as just being creeped out because I’m working alone and get to prepping, putting on music to help distract and motivate me to keep working, but I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched. \n\nIt feels like time has slowed considerably. It feels like twenty minutes, and at least six songs have gone by. I’m turning off the lights and clocking out when I see someone much taller standing behind me, in the reflection of the drink cooler. I’m 5’1 and the figure looked about 6 feet. I feel my fight or flight kick in, and I freeze. I don’t want to turn but I have to. Everything is my body is screaming at me to run.\n\nI about-face and turn to see nothing. I grab my phone, turn the radio off and race to shut the lights down. I escape through the back door and slam it shut. I told a few characters, but nothing more than the door bell going off when it wasn’t opened ever happened. \n\nCreepy. ",

        "text": "This post might get long, so I apologize for that and for some errors in the text (I'm not an English native speaker);  \n\n\nA few months ago, from January to February, I began having the feeling that something in my house was wrong. I live in a countryside of Southern Italy, in a zone sorrounded by hills and woods. Just after New Years' Day strange stuff started happening.   \nOne night I was coming back home and as I opened the front gate I could see a sort of slender figure running on top of my house' roof  (which is roughly 10 meters tall). It seemed odd because it had a very clear colour but the neighborhood's full of stray cats so I didn't pay it too much attention at first.   \nThen a week later, as the night came around 6 p.m. my dog began barking at something in the backyard and did so for at least 15 minutes. I was studying at that time and after the first few minutes I started feeling unnerved. It wasn't fully dark yet but my dog barking so loudly was very unusual; I quickly rushed outside. Chiro (my dog) was pointing the roof and as soon as she saw me, started snarling. I looked there myself but the only thing I could see were the branches of a nearby tree. The barking went on and when I checked the second time, Chiro was whimpering and this time she cuddled inside her doghouse in a hurry.   \nAround St. Valentine my dog became even more scared by our roof. She would bark constantly even in the middle of the night. At this point, I saw something again, running on top of the roof, again during night - I think it was around 2 a.m.- a skinny figure with some sort of clear colour or coat on it. This time I ran inside and shut the door behind me. As soon as I did so, I head some scratching noise from the upper floor and my dog barking again. I couldn't sleep all night. \n\nDuring the last week of the month snowed an incredible amount (the last time it snowed was in 2010) and the whole zone for several kilometers was white. Around the 21st I noticed some footprints in the last night's snow, footprints that came all over from the metal fence on the edge of the property all the way to the right side of the house. They were child sized and not much apart from each other. That night again I got no sleep and even my brother said that he had heard some scratching noise coming from the upper floor.   \nThen, the morning of the first of March, my mom used some of the soot from the chimney to draw a stickman on one side of the fireplace. She said that she'd done so every year as soon as March came; she added that her father did so and told her to do so using a rhyme in our local dialect which could be roughly translated as: \"Paint March for March paints you\".   \nEverything I mentioned so far stopped immediately after. No scared barking at the rooftop, no strange figures running on top of it, neither strange footprints nor scratching noises.   \n\n\nI'm truly lost about it. I thought it was simply folklore but it's so confusing. Any ideas on what could have been and why it stopped?",

        "text": "Reaching out to everyone here for some feedback. So I grew up in what I believed was a haunted home. I had a lot of awful experiences with paranormal sort of activity. However I always remember watching documentaries and such and adults saying they knew there was a paranormal presence in their home but it didn’t try to scare or hurt them so they were good with it. That never made sense to me until now. So I’ll get to the point. I’m 28, married to a wonderful and stable woman. We have a 8 month old daughter and in her room and her room only, I’ve felt a strong presence of something or someone being in the room as well and I feel like it’s just watching me. I have not had anything to confirm that feeling by way of noises, or anything making itself known, it is just an overwhelming feeling. My wife has been voicing since February of this year, when our daughter Sadie was born, she’s noticed a strong presence in there and it scares her. She said it scares her because she doesn’t know what it wants or if it means any harm and it’s just creepy. I was in a paramilitary academy from February to July and it was really strong when I was gone, according to my wife. \n\nSince I have been back, I’ve noticed when her bedroom door is open, I always have an overwhelming feeling of something or someone standing in the doorway watching me. It doesn’t coincide with the negative vibes I got as a kid. It’s strange because it feels like it’s there but I get no jacked up vibe from it so I don’t feel any fear, just more of a feeling that it’s there. \n\nLast night at around 4, my daughter woke up and was crying, as babies do through the night. Her door was cracked and I still was going to have to open it and she quit crying before I could completely open the door and I heard a very distinct and audible shushing noise that was gentle and soothing. It came from right beside her crib. I felt a really strong presence in the room but again, I wasn’t afraid. At the end of the day, I’m thinking that whatever or whoever the heck it is means no harm and is trying to comfort and or possibly protect my child (sorry if that seems corny) and I’m good with that. I’ve talked to my wife and she tends to agree. Just wanted some feedback from this subreddit maybe to validate that I’m not crazy. Thanks for the read and any feedback is greatly appreciated. \n\nTLDR: I’ve felt a presence in my kids room for a while, only just confirmed last night by hearing something shush my crying child. Doesn’t seem malicious, and I’m lookin for feedback. ",

        "text": "NOTE: I will be editing this post gradually to make it more concise and hammer out the details. Ideally my first attempt to experience the paranormal will begin this October- somewhere within Canada.   \n\n\nNOTE #2: Feel free to PM me if desired. If you know of a home, a person, a location, a ritual, that you believe can help me understand and believe in the Paranormal - send it my way.  \n\n\nORIGINAL: Inspired by comments on this subreddit; I have been asking myself how to best convince a skeptic? I feel I'm a good candidate to explore this, and I'd like your help.   \n\n\nWhat I'd like to do is completely personal. I don't have a website or a youtube channel. I'm not looking to PROVE to society that paranormal entities exist. I'm not here to debunk anything. (However I will share my experiences/findings with this subreddit and related forums as desired). I mainly want to adopt users experiences, and replicate them or discover my own. To experience something paranormal that will affect me and I can't fully explain. It doesn't even need to be 100% certain. I will develop a more precise list as I go, but will also accept anything that challenges my belief since science and paranormal are sometimes at odds. Since this is personal - I mainly want to experience it. So I don't need to be tossed across a room or see a full figure.  But it has to be more than \"a feeling\" or seeing a shadow. Something as small as a real time voice or an object move on it's own would do the trick. A mild to severe traumatic experience that cannot be explained through rational thought or science would be helpful.   \n\n\nBACKGROUND: I've been reading/watching/writing about the Paranormal for 15 years. I've \"ghost hunted\" a few times, but ultimately I don't believe. I WANT to. I am open to the possibility. However, I begin from a place of rationality and scientific facts. I work with testing equipment, so I can measure temperature and barometric pressure, light, take audio/visual recordings, even gases. I'd have to rent a Geiger counter. I can travel around North America. I also have no fears that I know of. \n\n  \nPROJECT PLAN: I was thinking I could spend the next year, visiting 15-20 places (or trying \"events\"), attempting to replicate the scenarios others have experienced. Eg: Time of day, time of year, items, precise locations... and follow whatever the tales, experiences, legends suggest. Stay overnight? Call out to certain entities? Bring an offering? I'll try it all. Where possible, I will also try my own methods. I will not consume drugs or alcohol or anything that will alter my natural perception of the world. Some of you may think that \"limits me.\" I disagree and won't waver on that.   \n\n\nINVALID/VALID EXAMPLES\n\n\\- Walking into a concrete tunnel from outdoors, and the temperature drops drastically. That's not an indication of a haunting. Initially that can be explained by atmosphere, humidity, condensation, lack of sunlight, etc. If all my alarm bells start going off - I'll explore that. If it's a pocket of warmth - that doesn't mean paranormal, but I will explore it.   \n\n\n\\- If I record an EVP and have to massively edit it to get it to sound remotely like anything; not valid. I didn't experience anything, and it had no effect on me or my surroundings, or perception. If I play it back and fully hear another voice over mine, when I was completely alone - that would do it. I get goosebumps just thinking of it.    \n\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts. Thanks for the assistance. ",
