So everybody, regardless of political affiliation, can now play the next round in the Trump game of musical chairs!\n\nPick [one senior figure](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXK5cVlW0AAOaxD.jpg) and the date they leave, and the first person whose pick loses their job or quits wins! Winner gets a no-expenses paid trip to Ken Ham's [Ark Encounter \"theme park\"](https://arkencounter.com/) in beautiful Williamstown, KY, courtesy of our prior winner /u/cyph8. In addition the winner will get other fabulous prizes and flair of their choice.* \n\n**Major RULE: Only put a name as a top level post if you're the first person to suggest them.** Otherwise reply to that post with other dates. This will make it easier to see who has been picked and when. If you start a new top level post on someone who already has been picked then your pick doesn't count. Try for a week's separation between picks of the same person. \n\nThis is not the place to brigade or attack the President or defend him, merely to guess who will be the next to depart to \"spend more time with their family/join an ashram.\"\n\nPrior Winners: \n\nDeath Pool IV: /u/cyph8 with Scott Pruitt\n\nDeath Pool III: /u/tanjasimone with Ronny Jackson\n\nDeath Pool II: /u/available_username2 with David Shulkin (TO THE DAY!)\n\nDeath Pool I: /u/greyscales with Joseph diGenova\n\n^*Prizes ^do ^not ^exist ^and ^would ^not ^be ^fabulous ^if ^they ^did, ^flair ^will ^probably ^be ^by ^mod ^choice, ^void ^where ^prohibited.\n\nWinner: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/8wkpvg/trump_admin_death_pool_v/e3x5udt/\n",
