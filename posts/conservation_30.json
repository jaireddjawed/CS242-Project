        "text": "Hi everyone! I’m Italian, I live in Veneto, the beautiful place that include Venice and a part of the Alps. On the Alps, we have a small population of wolves, conserved in some special areas, thanks to Project wolfalps. Project wolfalps has been created with European funds, and coordinates many areas, in Italy and in nearby countries. In Veneto, the president of the region and the environment assessor have decided to shut the project, and to hunt, sterilize and put into captivity the wolves. I can’t see such an atrocity and simply let it be, so I’ve created a small petition on change.org, to try to change their minds. I know that residents are the first people that should sign it, but I also think that wolves are an important source of biodiversity for that region, and that they could be an important source of tourism, so everyone that is interested, please sign it! I, but mostly the wolves, really need ALL OF YOU! The petition is in Italian, I know it isn’t easy to read, but you can try with google translate, if you want to understand better what’s this all about. After that, I kindly recommend all of you to read life wolfalps site, they can explain everything better than me! And, please, if you agree with me, and you know anyone else that could think the same, let them know! We are never enough. Thanks everyone for your patience and attention.\n\nPetition link: https://www.change.org/p/presidenza-regione-veneto-it-salviamo-il-lupo-salviamo-il-progetto-life-wolfalps?source_location=minibar\n\nProject wolfalps homepage (in English): http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/en/progetto-life12-natit000807/",

I do volunteer stuff, but I don't see what career options there are for someone who can't do intense field work. I have BSC in physical geog and some GIS&amp;remote sensing, but I don't want to be a developer/IT person. Coding is work, not fun. I can do it in R and python, but conservation is the only thing I can really get excited about.  Sorry for the dumb question, but I feel like September is coming up fast and since I can't seem to get a job, maybe some specific schooling would help prepare me - and I just don't know what schooling that would be. (That's question2) I only have a few bio and biogeography courses. I will never be a biologist.\n\nEdit: wow, I'm surprised no one has comments on this. Obviously biologists and field techs go out and deal directly with ecosystems and their members, but not everyone can do that. What are the other fields of work that contribute to conservation? No one has any ideas? I guess a \"green infrastructure planner\" can contribute to some relatively natural spaces and process, as well as contributing to us using less, which could help conservation, theoretically or at least in the short term.",

At this crucial point in history where humanity is poised to either undermine the life-support systems of the planet in the name of short-term profits or change course to a regenerative future that will support future generations, maintaining the integrity of the Amazon ecosystem is of critical importance.  Home to one-fifth of the world’s freshwater and provider of one-fifth of the air we breathe, the most biodiverse part of the planet has been under attack by industry for decades and there’s little or no time left to save it before irreversible ecosystem changes occur.  On this episode, Leila discusses what is happening on the ground in the Amazon, what needs to happen and what you can do to help.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. This is all just a bit of a pipe dream at the moment and not to be taken too seriously, but i thought i would ask for some advice all the same. I would like to set up a not-for-profit focused on stag beetles. The main aim of which would be an increase in the construction of stag beetle larval habitats across the UK. For reference created stag beetle habitats can be seen in the following link https://ptes.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Build-a-log-pile-for-stag-beetles.pdf\n\nMy very basic initial plan is as follows: I have just finished uni and am heading back to my parents (where i saw my first stag beetle for years recently). From there my plan is to is to create lots of stag beetle habitats around my local area in my spare time. Once i have constructed a reasonable amount of my own I will try and get some local schools involved, and use social media to encourage some others. By this point i will hopefully have a website (got a few developer friends). This website will feature a map of the UK with the locations of known created stag beetle habitats pinned, and will encourage members of the public to create habitats and let me know so i can add them to the map. People could be credited on the website for their habitat if they wish. Any stag beetle sightings could also be logged on the website, and of course it would have general stag beetle info.\n\nI have a couple of specific queries, but i welcome any advice whatsoever. 1) Is getting schools involved in something like this difficult? I imagine i would need a police check or something like that too. 2) Advice on how to expand this past my local area and across the UK?\n\nThanks.",
