        "text": "Consumer drain cleaner is pretty weak stuff, mainly because manufacturer's are terrified of being sued for chemical burns.  (the stuff pros  use is stronger, but this tip still applies).  So typically, if it even works the first time, it only clears enough of the clog to let water pass thru.  Many times you have to use a 2nd treatment (remainder of the bottle) to get a (more) clear drain.  It's probably not 100% clear, and within a couple weeks, will clog again.  Fortunate for the drain cleaner companies, as you'll probably have to run to the store and buy another bottle.\n\nThe best thing to do is use a plunger.  I will actually remove the clog!\n\nBe sure there's at least 1in of water sitting above the drain (add some if need be)  then place the plunger over the drain hole and slowly press down all the way (even a bit further than all the way if you can).  While pushing down, try to let as little of the air escape as possible.   Then once all the way down, quickly pull up on the handle, while still holding the plunger in basic place.  This creates a suction and will pull the hairball out of the drain.\n\nYou might have to do this 2 to 3 times, but eventually you will have a large hairball come up.   Be sure to catch it with either the plunger itself, or reach in and grab it.\n\nIf you don't want to tough the hairball, you can use the plunger, to keep pushing it further away from the drain until you get to a dry spot where it will stick.   Then use a paper towel to wipe it up, and throw away in the garbage.\n\nThis will keep your drain clearer much longer.",

Doing a lot of research, I found that one way is to literally convince yourself that you want to do that or that you like that.  \n\nMy question is what is the best way to do this? Should I just keep repeating something like \"I love studying\"? Should I try to convince myself with arguments maybe? Or even try something like hypnosis?  Has anyone ever done something like this? \n\nNot necessarily with study, it could be with any other activity.",

It’s sad to watch my early-20s friends just stand by and watch as their bosses, landlords, etc slowly bend the rules and make their lives hell. Younger people tend to let people in positions of authority walk all over them because they’re scared of the repercussions. Well as a seasoned non-shit-taker, I’m here to let you know that it’ll likely turn out in your favour. \n\nIs your boss not giving you breaks? Are they trying to make you do more work than you’re paid for? Is your landlord trying to illegally keep your deposit or make you pay for general wear and tear? \n\nCALL THEM OUT. \n\nThe sooner you let them know that you are NOT to be messed with, the sooner they’ll back down. Read up on your rights. They will likely cave immediately because they need you more than they don’t. It’s more effort for them to find a new employee, tenant etc or risk getting in trouble with higher ups than for them to just comply with the law. Don’t let people walk all over you! They’ll just get more and more audacious and then it’ll drive you insane.",

I want to get out of this mess and I want to fix my life and I've been saying this for months but nothing comes out of it just empty words and promises to myself. I don't know what's exactly holding me off from changing this situation sometimes I think that it might be some sort of unconscious fear of socializing I built over these last past years.\n\nAnyhow, I really want to change my life and get out of this rut, any suggestion or advice on how to step up to the world again and start having fun and meeting new people, doing new activities etc anything really that will get me to go out of the house more and feel more alive in a way ?",

Get them nice and trimmed up, maybe grow them out a bit, and get them painted a flashy, pretty color.  I recommend gel polish, since it lasts longer and will protect your nails.\n\nYou will find that you get a lot of attention from women complimenting your nails, asking where you got them done, and asking how you found the color.\n\nObviously, this is not an invitation to hit on said women, just a little bonus set of compliments to boost your mood.  Be flashy and show off, even if you're a schlub like me, you'll get some praise.",
