I actually work as an undergraduate researcher in his wife's lab, not that it matters, but they're both amazing researchers. Should I mention this in my personal statements for PhD programs? I'm applying to computational biology and stats programs. Some of my peers have told me it's a good idea because it exhibits how I've \"learned from one of the best\", but I also feel like it's kind of riding coattails. Does this kind of stuff even matter for PhD programs? The course is pretty difficult, but super engaging and one of my all time favorite courses (granted I'm only one week in). Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

It took me way too long to get the data entered and analyzed and the thesis written. I eventually got it done and passed a semester later than everyone else in my cohort. Throughout the program, the advisor constantly reminded me of how inadequate I was, at one point wondering out loud how I even got a bachelor's degree.\n\nIs my degree a sham? The university's reputation is otherwise pretty good, and their graduates are mostly competent and respected. The other students who passed did just fine and are having no trouble getting jobs. I can't find one and I have been trying for years. \n\nDoes this happen? Some one just slips through every now and again? Some one who doesn't deserve the degree? Does this reflect poorly on the advisor? Would they allow some one through who doesn't deserve to pass?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who responded. I'm sorry if anyone found my hand-wringing to be frustrating. There were some good answers here and this did help.",

So what kind of job I could realistically get if I graduate from this PhD program, both in academic and non-academic fields? And what should I do now to improve my job chances after graduation?

        "text": "Just a little background. I’m going into my fourth year of university, studying psychology. The past few years in school, I’ve done very well by focusing literally entirely *only on school.* I have a 4.0 GPA, but really do not have much of a life outside of school and studying. I’m at the point now where I have so many opportunities coming my way because of how hard I’ve been working the past few years. I have multiple profs wanting to work with me for my final thesis, and for similar research practicum courses. My grades don’t come easy to me… I put in long days of studying hours on end (10-12 hours, most days). I make a point of going to the gym everyday, but in terms of a social life or relationship, things have certainly been lacking for the past few years in these areas. My goal is to get into grad school – I’m not totally sure what program yet, but clinical psych definitely interests me.\n\n​\n\nLast month (over the summer) I met this guy that I’ve been seeing since then. A week ago, we made things official. But as the start of school comes closer, I find myself becoming more and more unsure of this relationship. I don’t want to sacrifice my school success and future career goals all for a guy. Ironically, this guy is not an academic whatsoever, which also makes me question the practicality of this relationship. I think that I irrationally worry that his lack of interest in school will sway me in this same direction. He completed a 2-year college program, but it’s definitely hard to have any sort of intellectual conversation with him.\n\n​\n\nAt the same time, though, I catch myself finding little, insignificant things about him that I don’t like, probably just to sabotage this relationship. I just seem to be distancing myself from him emotionally as school approaches. It seems like a catch 22: I want to maintain my 4.0 and get into a great grad school program, but honestly, focusing only on my studies in the way that I have been is… straight up lonely. Yet at the same time, I’m nervous to spread my attention and time across multiple domains in fear of doing poorly in school. I just don’t know what to do here. Is it possible to balance a serious relationship while maintaining really good grades? Thanks.\n\n​\n\n\\*TLDR\\*: Is it possible to balance a serious relationship (with someone who is not an academic) while maintaining very good grades in uni? School is still my #1 priority, but I’m tired of feeling so lonely.\n\n​",

This appears to be consistent with all the universities in France. They also all appear rather low in any rankings. Are French universities just bad, or are they not playing the rankings system?

        "text": "Hi. This is a throwaway account and likely very vague, but I think I may have inadvertently messed up. \n\nBACKGROUND: I recently transferred programs for family reasons and was able to come into my new PhD program with some credits—so I’m trying to finish coursework early. The department I am in requires you have two concentrations. There are only two courses (apart from my required course) offered this term that I could take to stay on track to take comps when I would have originally. I was registered for both, but the professor for one emailed the class and stated she was moving class up by 1.25 hours which is smack dab in the middle of the required course for me. I went and talked with her, and she was more than happy to let me come in 1.25 hours late and said all I needed to do was the readings since she won’t lecture, and likely ends class early. She was a bit dismissive about my concern that I felt like I wouldn’t be getting what I need out of the course if I’m only there for 30 or so minutes. I profusely thanked her for being so accommodating, but that I would likely not take her course so that I could take a different course not in my track with hopes it would be considered to be part of my track since there is overlap. \n\nPROBLEM: In said non-track class, the Prof happens to be the Chair of the department. After class, I asked if there would be any way his course could satisfy a requirement and he told me that it would not and asked why I wasn’t in the other class. I told him that I had a conflict since it was moved up, and he was shocked (and a bit annoyed) and went on a little spiel about how she isn’t supposed to do that, and asked me if he “fixed that” if it would “fix” my issue. I paled because I realized I likely just ratted out the other Prof to her boss without realizing it because I figured the department KNEW she changed her class-time. I stressed to him that it was my choice not to take it since she made me an offer to still take the course without really coming for all of classes. He dismissed that and said he was going to talk to her. \n\nQUESTION: This whole thing wouldn’t be an issue if I hadn’t transferred in with credits to let me finish early in this program. So, now I have no idea what to do. I’m more worried about my potential relationship with this Prof. Should I reach out and give her a heads up this happened? How do I even approach that? Do I ignore it and play dumb hoping she never figures out it was me? Now I’m realllllly hesitant to register for that course even if it does get pushed back to its regular time because then she (and the entire class) will know it was me, and everyone will likely hate me because it’s at a TERRIBLE time (super night class). Not taking it means I may have to take an extra semester which would thankfully be paid for, but sets my own timeline back. \n\nMORE PROBLEM: I wish I didn’t know this, but apparently this professor was hesitant about letting me transfer into the program given my research interests. I was awarded a research fellowship outside the department so I was admitted— and I think there may be some beef between the department and my fellowship institute. But knowing this professor already has some type of concern about me academically makes this much more awkward!!! \n\n\nHelp! \n\nEdit: A word ",

I've only just finished the Masters bit and about to enter the PhD part with a new supervisor I actively requested to transfer to.\n\n**My feelings:** I'm not really interested in continuing the PhD programme. This is not a case of a mid-programme slump or anything that can possibly be worked out by a conversation with my supervisor. I'm only at the beginning and I already see that the kind of output that's expected out of people in academia is not for me, impacts my mental health negatively, and most importantly, I don't see myself having a passion for it. I'm interested in the subject matter and applications of the tech I'd be working with but don't see myself investigating the deep theoretical aspects of it.\n\n**My current plans:** I'm in no rush to leave. I am planning to work for the PhD, as I would normally, but at the same time semi-actively be open to any opportunities of employment. As it stands a company in my area which I'm very interested in applying to.\n\n**The dilemma:** I'm not sure if the intent to apply to jobs outside the course and subsequently leaving it is something I should communicate to my supervisor. On one hand doing so creates an awkward situation where they'd be aware of my lack of long-term plan to stick with the programme so they might as well stop wanting to work with me now. On the other hand, should I get a job, it's also awkward to drop an *\"I'm leaving. BYE\"* bombshell out of nowhere without letting giving your advisor a chance to, well, advise. Luckily funding is not a part of the conversation because I have external funding. Does Internet have any thoughts on this situation? ",

I should add that this in the field of the performing arts/cultural theory/aesthetics.\n\nThere are two reviewers. One has provided a glowing response to the changes, and suggest that only a very short passage (of a very long piece of writing) needs revision before publication. In particular, they say I've brought together different theories in a productive way. They say it's a very strong piece of writing.  (Which is always nice to hear!)\n\n*However....* The other reviewer says the opposite. They say the writing needs work (I don't think they got on with the style). More fundamentally, they want me to either big up or excise one aspect of the theoretical framework. The message seems to be: make this a central theory within the pool of ideas on which you draw (and they are explicit about the terms in which they think this should happen). The aspect of the theory they refer to is one that the first reviewer mentioned specifically as an area that I've integrated well. So this has confirmed for me, in my mind at least, that its currently place in the argument works well.\n\nI've emailed the journal editor to ask their advice, but given that it's the summer I've got an out of office reply, and due date for my revisions is before their return, so I'm not expecting a response.\n\nWhat do you think? What do others do when peer reviews are in direct conflict with one another?\n\n(My first thought is that I'm going to following Reviewer 1's recommendation, while adding a few signposts for Reviewer 2, to make it clearer how this aspect of the theory functions within my argument as a whole. This will hopefully constitute an adequate compromise. In my response to the feedback I'd explain why I've done this. But I don't know if this would be satisfactory?)",

I'm not a TA, I'm the full-on teacher - I don't share any responsibilities with anyone for grading or lesson plans, it's all on me. \n\nI had my first two classes today, and I was so nervous that I blew through the syllabus both times and let them out half an hour early. I'm naturally a very quiet and introverted person who also struggles really badly with anxiety when it comes to speaking in front of others. So not only am I intensely dreading teaching two hordes of freshmen six times every week, but I'm also struggling to balance this with my own three highly demanding 600 level seminar courses. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips for a very shy, anxious person for teaching lectures completely on my own for the very first time? How to make the classes more at ease for both me and my students? Also any tips for balancing being a teacher and a student at the same time? Lesson planning for teaching every MWF while attending my own classes and doing the couple hundred pages of reading for homework every week is sending me into a bit of a panic, and it's just the first week.\n\nMany thanks in advance.

In my field (physics), my choices would probably be limited to China (+HK), Taiwan, Korea, Japan, or Singapore, but it'd be great to also get some views about other places around Asia.\n\n​\n\nI've heard that the situation of academia in China is steadily improving, but I also hear many academics complain about the difficulty to get grants and the salary being quite low to encourage publishing, since bonuses are often paid on a per-publication basis (which I find a bit ridiculous). On the other hand, I've heard that academics do quite well in Japan, but getting tenured at the vast majority of universities would require you to teach classes in Japanese - I'm curious about how universal of a requirement this is.

I would be glad to find a more efficient way.\n\nLet me explain it with an example.  \n\n Assume that I have to learn a topic  X ,   and it is explained it very well in some book which I don't know let's call it A. And, if I study X from A, assume that it only takes me one hour to really understand the topic., but unfortunately most of the time I am unaware of the existence of A.  So this is how I try to learn X,\n\n1. I google X check some Wikipedia articles\n\n2. I google X lecture notes, X.pdf\n\n3. I randomly choose one lecture note and study it\n\n4. Most of the case the lecture note was not at all good are not very relevant but it seemed relevant at first \n\n5. So I jump from one lecture note to another,\n\n6. I try to find relevant articles and they usually have one line that mentions X\n\n7. Usually, up to here, I don't find anything that explains exactly X  they only explain a topic related to X.\n\n8. In the end, I try to compile every piece of information I get from different and not very related sources. By using them I try to derive X by myself. Basically trying to reinventing the wheel.\n\nSo after these eight steps, I usually end up not learning it very well at all. I end up spending several hours if not days.  If at first, I had A all of this energy sucking process would end in an hour and I would understand X very well. I had the energy to progress.\n\nSo because of this inefficient way I waste a lot of time and energy, I lose weeks sometimes even months just because of not finding a correct material.  I would welcome any idea. I hope I explained the situtation clear enough.",

I have 4 papers worth of work from my PhD (3.5 years in UK), 2 of which were published during my PhD and 2 currently being edited for submission. Since finishing my PhD I have been working on publishing those last 2  papers but am currently embroiled in the following situation with my coauthors/old PhD supervisor over writing the first of the 2:\n\nFor the entire investigation, I planned the experiments, carried out all the measurements, collected all the data and did all the data analysis, and I also wrote an initial draft of the paper, which I have now passed to two senior postdocs within the group for comments etc. The problem however is that they have proceeded to completely take over my paper entirely,  tossing out pretty much everything I have written without any comment (besides a few paragraphs of the introductory section.) and even rejigged over half of my figures. I am not allowed by my PI to even politely contest any of those changes they have made to the paper (and they ignore everything I say during discussions) otherwise they will refuse to continue working on or submit my paper. Trying to submit the paper without their contributions will lead to the paper being withdrawn by the PI. \n\nI know well that comments and any amount of criticism on the paper, especially from more experienced researchers, are usually necessary to get a paper draft in good shape. I've also nothing against including the aforementioned senior researchers as co-authors, especially as one was my sub-supervisor/mentor throughout the investigation and the other I have had a couple of discussions with (at the insistence of the main PI). My main concern is **whether I still have a claim to first authorship of the paper, given that my coauthors have now rewritten a substantial part of the paper and even edited a large portion of the diagrams?**\n\nI cannot discuss this politely with the coauthors/PI because I know they would highly likely think of me as rude for bringing this up whilst they are supposed to be helping me. However this issue is constantly on my mind, as I fear that by taking this paper more or less out of my hands they will eventually try to demote me from first author also. \n(They have already even made a few decisions behind my back regarding the paper which they then make me acquiesce to!)\n\nWould love to hear what you all think about this issue please. And also if any of you have experienced something similar. Thanks so much for your time.\n(Apologies if you think I'm being too uptight or conceited in fixating over what seems a trivial issue; I am hoping to continue in academic research and so first authored papers are extremely crucial for my research profile.)",

My GPA is also not great (2.7). \n\nRegardless, my goal is to eventually go to grad school and hopefully get a PhD. I truly love the subjects of biochem/cell science/molecular bio, and have matured and have gotten better grades the past couple semesters. I love science. I just wasn’t always disciplined. \n\nI have a little research experience (no publications, yet) and a few impressive extracurriculars, but I still don’t believe this will be enough to get me in. So I’m thinking about doing a couple years in industry first. \n\n**But how should I utilize this additional senior year? I plan on volunteer researching with a couple  labs. But my course loads are very low since I’m just trying to graduate. Should I add a couple more and get good grades in them to prove myself? Or will grad schools only care about research? The classes I had in mind were something relevant like microbio, or biostats. I don’t wanna waste money on them if they’ll mean nothing. \n\nI already took a Python class and am taking a Bioinformatics class because I enjoy programming and I hear it’s important in biochem now. Should I take/do something else this year too? \n\nAny and all advice would be appreciated. I’m open to brutal honesty. Thank you! ",

I'm asking this question because I do a lot of software projects on the side and recently have been interested in developing tools that could potentially help academics and researchers to be more efficient with their work.\n\nI really value the work academics like yourselves do. However I have very little experience and knowledge about **how you conduct your day to day work, what common problems you face, things you find tedious to do**, and so on. Most of what I know has been through interactions with professors and lecturers throughout my B.Sc and M.Eng  programs.\n\nFrom some basic research (google and reddit) it seems like the big tools used in academia revolve around managing references (zotero/mendeley), note taking and organization (evernote, onenote), and collaborative writing and publishing (overleaf/authorea). Other tools for mind mapping (xmind) and project management in the form of simple kanban boards (trello?) also seem to be quite popular.\n\nWould really like to hear first hand opinions and experiences from academics about the current offerings of tools that are available to you. And even if you have none, would still like to hear about your general workflow and how you get shit done (or things that slow you down?). Feel free to PM me also!\n\n**EDIT:** Hacked together my own take of an integrated PDF reader and annotation tool over at [https://quicknotes.app/](https://quicknotes.app/). At the time of posting this edit, I made this tool in about a day so please mind any bugs and lack of features. If you have feedback feel free to PM me.",

        "text": "So I got accepted to present a paper at a research conference.   \nI've never been to a professional conference (just High School level science conferences) and I'm feeling a little out my league.  \nSome background: I'm just starting towards my undergrad degree 5 years after leaving high school, and have been put in a position where I'm now writing and assisting with analysis on 5+ papers all at once, all prior to taking any courses in the field I'm publishing in. \n\nThe conference is primarily PhD students or those working post grad school.\n\nTL;DR I have anxiety and feel extremely unqualified to present at this conference and I need some advice  \nSo my questions,\n\n1) What do I wear? I'll be presenting in a 90 minute session with 3-4 other presenters. I'm a woman and loathe make-up, and I have no idea what exactly the dress code is for these type of events.\n\n2) How do I deal with the situation of being in a conference with a bunch of people I don't know, in a town I'm not familiar with? What is the scope of \"networking\" that I should do? And should I try and do some beforehand?\n\n3) In general, what's the best way to deal with nerves/anxiety in this situation? As far as I can find, I'll be the least \"qualified\" presenter at this conference, and I'm sort of terrified of someone just pointing out a major flaw in my research and being *embarrassed* by that.\n\n4) I'm also dealing with IBD and arthritis stuff, so, is it just okay to be like \"I gotta leave real quick\" whenever I just *have* to leave and deal with pain or other stuff? And given this, I don't have that much energy to do stuff. I see people referencing lots of dinners and stuff, but that sounds exhausting, and I'll probably not have the energy for those activities, is that okay?\n\n5) How do I get myself in the mindset of \"I am the expert on my research\" when I am outranked by everybody else in the room I'm presenting to? Is there some trick that I should know?\n\n6) How many of the events at the conference should I be expected to attend? How much break time should I take to myself throughout each day?  \n\n\nAny other stuff I should know going in? I know this is long, I really appreciate the time if you have advice.",

Since then I've only had survival jobs unrelated to my training. I've found a few research analyst job postings in my area and am very excited about them, but I don't want to get my hopes up. I've looked at some very interesting publications and articles on the profession and it seems to be very common for people to come into IR from other areas of academia or industry. That is, most people don't obtain a specific degree to become a research analyst. But many of the narratives and studies I've read say that people had much more work experience with academia (e.g. registrar, director of advising) or in the private sector.\n\nI have three questions below. Insights or advice on any or all of the questions are very much appreciated.\n\n(1) aside from my degree, the collaborative work I did with my advisor, and the teaching I did in grad school, I don't have much relevant work experience. The job I'm most hopeful for asks for a BA and two years experience or an MA and one year of experience. I meet the minimum requirements, but I'm not sure if I'll be competitive. I'm sure that people with much more experience will be applying for this job.\n\n(2) Are anthropologists a good fit for this kind of job? The post lists business, statistics, psychology, sociology, economics or related field as appropriate. I have plenty of training in statistics, but would my qualitative skills be a good thing to emphasize?\n\n(3) The posting also asks for database management skills, which I don't have any experience with. I've read up a bit on SQL and Access, but it's not something I'm proficient in. How much of the job involves proficiency in this? Is it something I can pick up if I were to get the job?",

I am looking into transitioning to research in computational statistics / data science, particularly in the area of social network analysis. I have been closely following the work of several university labs I am interested in and have a good idea of the type of topics I want to pursue, which tie well with my business background.\n\nObviously whilst there are links between my original field of education / work and the field I want to research there are also considerable differences, particularly in  the prerequisite knowledge of advanced statistical methods and programming in the latter. Having already received some feedback from potential supervisors and a couple of unsuccessful applications to funded \"1+3\" programmes (preparatory MSc + PhD), I suspect that whilst I have developed stats and programming skills at a very good level  primarily through work experience, this and my current educational background simply do not seem to be adequate to secure funding in the field and/or develop a compelling thesis particularly on the methods side of things.\n\nI am therefore considering taking an MSc in Statistics before proceeding with any further PhD application in the hope that this will allow me to get more up to speed with relevant skills, hone my thesis, and have a better shot at securing a funded doctorate at a good lab. While I realise that there are direct and hidden costs to doing an MSc that may deduct from any subsequent PhD funding, the latter does not only interest me in terms of finances but also as a necessary CV perk in the saturated academic job market in the UK.\n\nI was wondering if others have found themselves in similar situations. In this particular case, does a second master's make sense or are there perhaps easier or different ways to achieve this? And more generally, are two master's in different fields viewed negatively by academic commitees and the academic world at large or do they perhaps denote a lack of focus ?\n\nMany thanks for any thoughts or suggestions!",

I've tried LaTeX, but I feel distracted by the LaTeX commands when I'm writing and editing.\n\n[Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) is super clean and makes writing and citing simple. But, cleaning up or manualing coding formating is a pain. Authorea uses both LaTeX and HTML, which you can edit manually by going into the data files for each document. Overleaf makes editing the code much easier, since you can just toggle back and forth.\n\nAuthorea also has problems with copy-paste functions, moving figures within a document, and citation formatting when you export to PDF. I've talked to them, and they say these things are under active development. \n\nSo, Authorea, Overleaf, or something else? Do you normally start writing in a program like these or copy material drafted elsewhere into a LaTeX editor?\n\nThanks for sharing your perspectives!",
