Is there something specific to now about academia in Czech Republic? I would be happy to receive any info! Thank you Reddit :)",

I'm having a tough time deciding which opportunity to pursue, and would love to hear any insights or perspectives you might have.\n\nHere are some of the factors I'm considering:\n\n* The research projects at each location are similar and equally interesting to me.\n* The compensation package is better at ORNL in terms of salary, but Sweden has a better pension plan and more holiday time.\n* Professional development opportunities will be better at ORNL.\n* Health insurance is equally good at both locations.\n* I don't have a strong preference for location - both Stockholm and Oak Ridge would be fine for me.\n* I ideally want to work in industry, but I'm not sure which opportunity will help me achieve that goal.\n* The research culture and work-life balance at each location are important factors for me.\n\nIf you have any experience working at either a thinktank or ORNL, or if you have any general advice for someone",

Things are good for me overall. But the darkness creeps in and I often feel there’s nobody I can turn to. I bombed an R1 job talk.

Not coauthors - supports. \n\nI’ll add one other thing: research finds that friends can be our greatest source of both support and conflict, including being the sources of rumors spread against us and attacks on who we are. Figuring out the people who can be more the former than the latter seems so hard in our small fields, where the incentives to stay closed off and keep up a positive image are strong.",

Research productivity is a key component of professional success, and publishing papers and securing grants are crucial steps toward achieving tenure and promotion. However, balancing these research demands with other responsibilities such as teaching, advising students, committee work, and service to the academic community can be challenging. Many academics struggle with finding enough time and resources to pursue research while still fulfilling their other professional obligations. Furthermore, different academic institutions and departments may prioritize research and teaching in different ways, adding to the complexity of the situation. Finding a balance between these demands is an ongoing challenge for many researchers in academia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of that, I have the following questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- How do you manage your time and prioritize your tasks to ensure that your research receives the attention it deserves while also fulfilling your other obligations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- What strategies have you found to be effective in maintaining a productive and sustainable work-life balance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShare your experiences and insights on managing the demands of academia in this thread.

One reason is that I feel that there is no right or wrong in lots of issues in academia, so I am not a big fan to convince others of my point of view, which makes me feel like I am projecting my ego to others and try to change them. I don't want to change anyone. I know this is not the right way to view academic argument. I might confuse the concept of academic argument and personal conflict. \n\nAnyway, I always meekly accept other people's views on the surface and disagree with them inside. I am not brave enough to express view probably because I feel these views are just opinions and are not well supported by evidence. But I know that people feel bored if I just blindly agree with them and not arguing against them. People favor and think highly of those who challenge them.\n\nGradually, I realize not being able to defend myself is a huge weakness and can hold me back in lots of occasions, such as networking, finding jobs, leaving impressions for others, etc. People seem to naturally trust those who speak confidently as if they know their stuff so well regardless of the real content they say. If someone like me  who speak so meekly and quietly, people tend to think I am not trustful with the things I say. I am hesitant in answering things confidently is because I worried too much about the complexity of questions. Nothing can be answered with several simple answers, and I usually end up saying nothing interesting.\n\nWhat should I do to improve?",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm having some difficulty trying to decide between an MD or a PhD in Neuroscience. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post!\n\nFor some context, I just graduated from university a semester early in December, and I'm now working full-time as a Research Associate for a well-known neuroscience institute in the US with very accomplished PIs. My plan throughout college was to go to medical school (I took all the required classes, did all the activities, was in research for 3 years, got 1 publication, etc...) but now I'm having doubts about whether I actually want to get my MD. I've taken the MCAT twice, and my most recent score is fine, but not great (I think I'd have some trouble getting into MD schools given that I'm ORM). I've taken some time to really think about if I want to retake it again before this upcoming cycle, but I just have no motivation whatsoever.\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, I've tried to draft my PS for med school apps, but I'm realizing I don't actually have a straightforward answer as to why I want to be a doctor/go to medical school. It seems like I'm trying to force an answer to align with what adcoms are looking for in a future doctor, and now I'm worried I haven't really given med school serious thought. It just seemed like the go-to path for an undergrad like me who loves neuroscience and the brain. I should also add that I kinda skimped out on clinical volunteering in undergrad -- I got clinical experience through activities other than being a medical assistant in the hospital or being an EMT, and thinking about doing those things doesn't really excite me.\n\nI've shadowed psychiatrists, a neuroradiologist, and a neurologist, and while they were all rewarding experiences, I started asking myself if I'd get bored of the routine/monotony of seeing patients every day. I also should note that every single one of these doctors told me \"it wasn't too late to change my mind\" about med school, and while I thought they were joking, I am now wondering why each doctor made the same comment. Some people really like the stability and predictability of being a practicing physician, but idk I feel like I would get bored easily.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\n**About me:**\n\n\\- I love writing, the brain, neuroscience, passionate about mental health/illnesses, also interested in criminal justice (thought I wanted to go to law school my first year of college lol)\n\n\\- comfortable being around people, I like being social and giving presentations gives me some anxiety but I'm able to do them fine\n\n\\- terrible at memorizing facts (this worries me if I were to go to med school), especially memorizing things I'm genuinely not interested in\n\n\\- bad at bio (I find some things interesting, but I don't really understand the bigger picture sometimes)\n\n\\- my undergrad research was in an autism lab, and my honors thesis was also about this population but using neuroimaging techniques/fMRI scans and data (I LOVED working on this project and got the highest distinction after review)\n\n**Reasons FOR MD:**\n\n\\- job stability, very good pay\n\n\\- neuroradiology/neurology could be interesting specialties\n\n\\- be able to prescribe medicine (idk if I really care about doing this tho?)\n\n**Concerns about MD:**\n\n\\- lot of debt and so many years of schooling including residency and fellowships... also I don't think I'm going to succeed if I have to memorize and recall things I'm not really interested in\n\n\\- dealing with patients every day would wear me out I think\n\n\\- idk if I really see myself directly helping people every day\n\n**Reasons FOR PhD:**\n\n\\- I'll get to work on what I know I'm passionate about and be intellectually curious\n\n\\- be at the forefront of science -- a step ahead of just prescribing patients medicine/drugs -- helping future individuals indirectly rather than providing immediate care as a physician\n\n\\- not as much schooling/time, also won't really be in debt (hopefully)\n\n\\- working in my job right now I'm seeing firsthand how well-connected neuroscientists are, and the community is really spectacular. I love how PIs collaborate with each other across the world and each one of them kinda has a \"brand\". Idk if this is a good/correct way to think about this, but being a great neuroscientist is appealing to me because I'll be well-known for my work/papers, whereas being a great doctor kinda makes me well-known in my community for helping others? (Don't mean to offend anyone I'm just thinking through my values and how I find myself being fulfilled)\n\n\\- eventually will get to speak at conferences and I can see myself being really proud of my work and discoveries and wanting to speak about them\n\n**Concerns about PhD:**\n\n\\- job security? Maybe I don't want to be a professor for the rest of my life? I know some people go into consulting, I could see myself maybe going into biotech, but how likely is this? Maybe starting a company?\n\n\\- pay isn't that great? Although one of my thesis mentors who has a PhD makes close to $400k...but not sure how\n\n\\- will this degree actually be worth it? I've heard/read mixed things\n\n\\- worried maybe I'll get bored of the *process* of research (not that I'll get bored of neuro interests, but grant writing, admin things like that)\n\nAgain, sorry for the lengthy post but I really wanted to give the full picture here. I'm really conflicted and not sure what to do... I also am just now starting my gap year and I don't know if I want to take another one. MD apps are due this June, and PhD apps wouldn't be due until Decemberish. Any and all advice/insight would be super helpful!! Thanks everyone in advance!!",

I accepted because I liked the course, and the scholarship gave me the financial freedom to live alone, and travel, an experience new things.\n\nMy MA thesis there got a great grade, has won a prize offered by a humanities journal, and will be published in it. Another scholar has also approached me to contribute to a related collection he's writing. \n\nMy MA supervisor has encouraged me to pursue a funded PhD opportunity at this university.  I like him a lot, he is very supportive, and I know he would advocate for me and use his connections to help me. He has published plenty of reputable work in areas I'm interested in. I'm also sure I would have freedom and support to choose a topic that I'm passionate about.\n\nHowever, I also feel conflicted because of the ranking of the University. Some people have told me not to sell myself short, that I should be applying to Oxbridge. I don't want to be an academic star, but I also want to be respected once I graduate and given the opportunities I feel I deserve. Others simply say follow the funding and with my passion success will come regardless. \n\nIf anyone has any advice, I'd be very appreciative.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/11hwrxy/how_to_remove_selfishness/",
        "text": "  \n\n**REMOVAL OF SELFISHNESS**\n\n: To retain the identity of self is the fundamental and is not wrong. It is also the basic requirement in the absence of which you may be misled to think that you are God.\n\nThere are devotees who have even forgotten the livelihood in the context of God. If you are interested in some topic, you will forget taking meals. *To remove the selfishness completely, the attraction to God must be intensified to the top level.* The power of attraction to God will break the power of your attraction to yourself and other related selves.\n\n*Selfishness is different from self-awareness.* Self-awareness means the knowledge of the reality of yourself and other selves. If you are aware that you are not God and that you are only a self created by God, this is self-awareness. Selfishness means your attraction to yourself and other selves. Generally, it is thought that *if you are attracted to yourself and few other selves only, it is selfishness.* It is also thought that *if you are attracted to all the selves in this world, it is not selfishness.* This point may be correct in confined view. But, with respect to deep and broad view, this is also not correct. If you are attracted to yourself, few other selves and all the selves in the creation, it is selfishness only.\n\n*If you are attracted to God, then only, it is not selfishness.* If you rise above yourself and a few selves and get attracted to all the selves in the creation, then, you will get temporary heaven only. You will get the permanent place of God, if you are detached from the all the selves and get attracted to God only. Therefore, in the attraction to God, there is no attraction to any self including yourself other than God. Hence, the selfishness totally disappears in the devotion to God only. But, you must have the self-awareness during the devotion to God. \n\nIf self-awareness is absent, there is a danger that you may think that you are the God. Earning the livelihood comes under the self-awareness only and not selfishness. You must maintain yourself and other selves in the family so that all of you shall be alive to be in the devotion to God. Without livelihood the self disappears and you must maintain the self to have at least the self-awareness. You can also help any hungry soul by providing the food so that the soul will maintain itself and get devoted to God. God created the souls for the sake of His entertainment. *The life of His entertainment is the devotion for which, the maintainence of the soul is essential.* Therefore, God created the natural instinct in every soul to earn the livelihood for the maintainence of its life. If any soul resists this instinct and does not act as per the instinct, such a soul will subject to the displeasure of the God. If you follow the instinct, you are co-operating with the maintainence of the drama of the entertainment of God.\n\nSelfishness is involved in the unnecessary extra earning for the sake of luxuries. The environmental sciences prove that any luxury is harmful not only to the individual but also to the society. The science also proves that absence of luxury, maintains perfect health of any human being. Therefore, selfishness is born out of the ignorance of scientific knowledge. The knowledge of science in real sense can eradicate the selfishness and spiritual knowledge is not necessary for this purpose. *Selfishness is the harmful love towards yourself and other selves.*\n\nSacrifice is the best medicine for this disease of selfishness. Selfishness is the excess of love to self, which is the extra love. *The love to self required up to the maintainence by earning livelihood is appreciable to God also.* The attraction to luxuries indicates the extra unnecessary love to the self, where the love to God finds no place. When the water tank is full and is over flowing, where is the space for more water to pump in? Therefore, the heart must be vacant to fill with the love to God. The minimum water level, which is the instinct for livelihood is essential. To make the pump work for sucking the ground water, some water must be poured into the pump. This poured water is the essential requirement for sucking the ground water.\n\n**How to destroy selfishness?**\n\n**The service to God with selfishness will not fetch you the real grace from God**\n\nSelfishness is not some material to be blown away applying some physical instruments and physical forces. It is conceptual nervous energy existing in the mind and the concept is totally wrong. A wrong concept can be removed by right concept only. A diamond can be cut by another diamond only. Of course, *while cutting the diamond, not only another diamond is required but also the force in the process of cutting is required.* Another diamond is knowledge and the force in the process of cutting is devotion. Therefore, the right concept associated with devotion to God can only succeed in destroying the selfishness. \n\nWhen the selfishness is cut at the root, your service to God will be perfect and will please God. The service to God with selfishness will not fetch you the real grace from God. You can only receive some boons to satisfy your selfishness. *In fact, the selfishness grows more and more by the boons just like the fire grows more and more by receiving the ghee.* The process of pacification of selfishness increases it more and more. You can never subside the selfishness by such process of pacification. The selfishness really subsides when it is cut by knowledge associated with devotion. Then your service to God without selfishness will fetch you the real and immense grace from the God.\n\nwww.universal-spirituality.org\n\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace",

Math is not my strong suit. I could probably make it through an econ or statistics course with some help/struggle, though.

Because I don't have that. Just some run of the mill marketing jobs.\n* I think a few of the professors I had good relationships with are dead/retired now. Are schools really going to be wanting LORs from professors who may or may not remember me from 10 years ago?\n* Is there anyone out there with a business PhD interested in talking more?\n* Why is it so hard to find general info about business PhDs online (other than directly from specific schools)?

My writing process has been super slow and it doesn't feel possible for me to finish the thing by then. The work i have is in really good shape, but i still have one more chapter to finish and then do the introduction and final revisions. I've had a lot of good feedback on my work and they seem to think i have a chance at a job. I did a really limited job search this year and got an interview, but ultimately didn't get anything, although I'm submitting to some postdocs with spring deadlines. \n\nThe problem is that I'm so burned out that the thought of anything beyond my dissertation fills me with dread. I've been living in a pretty constant state of stress since the beginning of the pandemic and I think I've finally hit my breaking point. My body is physically revolting and mentally I feel like an absolute basketcase.\n\nI'm basically so clouded by emotions and stress that I don't know what i want and i think I need to be finished before I can lucidly plan next steps. I wanted to do a postdoc next year and give the job market one more go, but to do so I would have to relocate to a city far away from my spouse.  given my current mental state, the thought of being away from her fills me with dread. She's been my rock throughout this whole process and I'm afraid that the distance would be really bad for my mental health given my current state. At the same time, I'm really worried that if I don't try for these temporary jobs then I'm basically shooting myself in the foot if i want any chance at a TT job - and at this point I do want to try again, or at least see how I feel after i graduate before ruling myself out of that career path. \n\nWith that in mind, i wondered if anyone here had advice. (I've tried to broach this topic with various faculty in my program, but I really struggle to articulate that I'm having such a hard time and get them to understand.)\n\nHow did you manage mental health issues at the fend of your dissertation? do you have any advice about what helped you get through it? \n\nHow do you handle burnout in general when you have really important deadlines or milestones? \n\nWould I be sabotaging my career chances to stay local this year and join some local lecture pools while I recover from burnout rather than pursuing the postdoc route right away?\n\n\nI know some people might say that maybe this isn't the career path for me, but if you could refrain from that type of advice at the moment, that would be great. I am currently thinking very carefully about that question, but would like to wait until I am done and starting to recover from the stress and burnout before I think in earnest about that, as the constant worry is making it harder to focus on writing.",

Between the other instructors and the students' need to work on assignments, there should be a reasonable amount of non-instruction time. Prep time of course will vary. The small class sizes are typically rewarding. Best of all, no endless stream of emails about nonsense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a cost comparable to tuition, the students would get a very personalized education. Lots of opportunity for quick growth. Even for those less ambitious, private lessons are a great way to receive instruction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not necessarily see this as a four-year thing. There's a certain breadth of subject matter which would be missing (unless maybe instructors rotated \\~yearly). Plus there's the social aspect, physical labs, and credentialing of a traditional college. But one year of intense instruction learning the ropes and intricacies of your major? That sounds like a win-win here. Provided a like-minded and interested adjunct could be found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow there are certain realities opposed to this. Loans. Credentialing/Degrees. High hurdles which would take a determined effort to resolve (though I have ideas...).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut is it too much to hope for a business model which will serve as a disruptive innovation. Which will put more emphasis and money towards the teachers actually providing the product until the colleges too are forced to adapt? Or is such a pipe dream?",

I emailed my professor about it 6 days ago because spring break was approaching quickly. I got no response, so I emailed her again with no response. Now, our midterm is listed as due this Saturday, so we have a day to prepare. I work 50 hours a week minimum, and I'm really pissed about this.\n\nNow that being said, I don't know if I'm right to be this angry. Are online classes just like this? Is this what I should expect?

I made the postdoc institution aware of my situation, and they said I should ask to defer my faculty start date by 1 year during the negotiating phase, if I get an offer. Apparently a 1-year delay is not uncommon.\n\nHow much of this should I tell the TT interviewers? Should I be totally transparent and say that I accepted a postdoc offer, so my preference would be to delay the faculty position (the reason being that another year as a postdoc would make me an even stronger/more experienced researcher before I start as faculty)? Or should I only bring this up during the negotiating phase?\n\nThanks for any advice you can give!\n\nNote: If I got the TT position and they refused to delay the start date, I would take the TT job, since it feels too valuable to pass up. However, I'd feel badly about it since that would burn bridges with the postdoc institution (since I already accepted) so I'd really like to avoid that.",

Are they common in your country?\n\nI'm from the UK and I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees there, and also worked for 3 years as a technician there. During my studies I was completely unaware of the existence of lab shoes. I never saw them and never heard about them. We always wore our regular shoes in the lab.\n\nWhile working as a technician I encountered lab shoes for the first time - I met 3 people who wore them - 2 Austrians and 1 Ukrainian.\n\nFor anybody confused, lab shoes are slippers, similar to Crocs, but usually made with a waterproof fabric top and rubber sole.\n\nI then did my PhD in Germany, and around 50% of my colleagues wore lab shoes. They would change their footwear in the morning and wear the lab shoes around the labs and offices all day unless they went outside. The other 50% wore regular shoes. On my brief visits to other institutes I noticed roughly the same lab shoe population dynamics.\n\nNow I'm a postdoc in Austria, and the lab shoe situation is out of control here. Not only are lab shoes mandatory in the lab, but almost all of my colleagues have \"house shoes\" as an additional intermediate step between their regular shoes and their lab shoes. They arrive in the morning and exchange their regular shoes for house shoes, which they wear around the offices, and then when entering the lab, change the house shoes for lab shoes. There's a small changing area at the entrance to the lab where everyone's lab shoes are stored, but regular shoes are forbidden from entering the changing area, only house shoes... So far I'm resisting getting house shoes and instead running from my office to the changing area in my socks.\n\nSo, do you wear lab shoes? I suspect it may be a common thing in central and eastern Europe but I really have no clue how widespread it is.",

They already had enough RAs for fall but said I could do desk work and join in the spring if there are any openings. My fall semester was alright. Although I wasn't doing any research, I got a general sense of the clinic and the people there.\n\nI'm a bit quiet but will try to strike up a conversation (though I'm a bit awkward at it at times) as I should do my best to represent the clinic as the first person participants see when they walk in. I've still struggled to connect with the people at the clinic and have been cordial for the most part. This Spring I was excited to finally join as an RA. I know most of the research is data collection and the \"cool stuff\" is scattered throughout, nonetheless, I thought I would get a lot of hands-on things to do. \n\nOne of the recruiting grad students forgot to give me instructions on doing training material in the fall when I was free, and I was given a week to complete this right at the beginning of the spring semester, that too on a time crunch. Along with my other classes, it did take me more than a week for me to finish up the training, and there was a lot of back and forth between me and another supervising grad student to get all the necessary certifications in. She seemed pretty understanding of it for the most part. She also felt more like a peer to me, as she was in one of my classes as a senior the previous year.\n\nIt's 2 months in, and tbh, I haven't really been doing much at the lab. I'm supposed to shadow them in data collection during participant trials, and have been given some menial number calculation tasks to do. Also, scheduling isn't very stringent. I've asked around, and the general consensus is I come in whenever I'm available. I'll show up, but most of that time is spent sitting around. I'm also very quiet and awkward, so it's been hard connecting at a personal level.\n\nToday a midterm grade popped up for me online and it was a B. The classmate grad student said this grade isn't a reflection of the final grade but a check-in for the semester. Her reasoning was that she would like to see improvements in overall organization/time management. Commitment and productivity will likely improve with better organization/management of deadlines and expectations. \n\nI can understand her perspective but would like to reach out and talk about it in person. I don't believe I've been given any task of importance and I feel like the organization from the lab's end also plays a role in my overall performance. But, I also would like to wholeheartedly improve as an RA. How do I approach this situation?",

During my first year, she helped me navigate graduate school / our group / and gave me helpful pointers about my research and provided hands-on coding assistance. By the end of that first summer, I had put together the manuscript and sent it out to co-authors for review. I had no understanding of what qualified someone as a co-author, so initially the paper had about 20 authors - anyone who was even tangentially related to the work was a co-author. My advisor trimmed the list down to 7 and my friend was taken off. \n\nWe weren't on talking terms at the time (stupid stuff), but I gave a group meeting update and when she saw her name in the acknowledgements and not the co-author list, she almost melted down in the group meeting. I didn't see why it was such a big deal - and tbh I still don't. As students, we are evaluated almost exclusively on our first-authored publications. I did include her name in the acknowledgements.  \n\nWe rekindled our friendship and things went back to normal. I would talk to her about my projects, she would give some discussion, etc. Again always in the acknowledgements. Didn't have any problems. \n\nAfter a few years of post-doc, she became a faculty at a top-5 program. We would still talk frequently, but she always brought up how she felt people were taking advantage of her and not giving her proper credit for her contributions. As a faculty member, where her time is on admin stuff, but her evaluation is on publications / getting grant money, I can again sympathize with her frustrations - her time is finite and valuable. But again, her evaluation is on publications from her group. \n\nI had two papers going on a few years ago that again she and I discussed, but it's not like she provided any real input to any of the work. She wouldn't be able to describe any of the methods or details of the papers either. Once again don't think it warranted co-authorship. Not to mention at this same time, I would literally review her group's papers pre-submission. Did it twice. 0 co-authorship invitation and not included in the acknowledgements. (not like I cared, just pointing out the hypocrisy). Well she got super upset about the whole thing and we haven't talked since (been about a year and a half...to be fair there were other things that contributed to the 0 communication)\n\nOh and she's also a black woman and uses her twitter account to discuss how she's a \"hidden figure.\" Naturally, everyone in the field agrees with her publicly. \n\nIdk why I'm posting this exactly. Not sure exactly what type of feedback I'm hoping for/expecting. Maybe it's just frustration of how irrational and delusional people can be - the only way it's hurt me is losing a friend (which isn't a great feeling, but professionally it hasn't adversely affected me).",

I am uninterested in it, the course is confusing and the textbooks for the course are pretty damn expensive. I am currently sitting at a D and I have no hope that I can turn my grade around in these coming months. I've tried to suck it up and push through but the class drains a lot out of me mentally. I understand that since I am dropping it past the refund date a W will appear on my transcript. This course is unrelated to my major and career.\n\nMy question I bring to you all is that is it a good idea to just drop it? Other questions I am curious about:\n\n1. What are the negative downsides to this?\n2. Will this negatively impact my FAFSA? Could they deny my next application?\n3. Will I have to refund the class?\n4. Will I *have* to redo the class later on (though I would like not to, will I be forced to?)\n\nI honestly just need clarity before I spiral down my rabbit hole of insanity. Thanks in advance.",

        "text": "Hi all! \n\nI am hoping for some advice on completing a PhD in the US vs the UK as a US citizen. Last application cycle, I was accepted into 2 clinical psych PhD programs, and I ultimately realized I just wasn’t passionate about psych. My background is more behavioral neuroscience, with post-bac work in CNS/neurodegenerative population via EEG and MRI. I’m also currently now in industry doing neuromodulation interventional research and loving it but looking for more ownership in the scientific process. \n\nWith that being said, I applied this cycle to Cambridge for a Clinical Neuro PhD, (without having a masters). They’re a hub for TBI research, which is a main interest of mine, and I love the ability to just focus on research, rather than teaching/coursework as additional responsibilities. Additionally, the ability to do research fully in a hospital setting seems to be more limited in the US, particularly for TBI (most PIs I’ve been in touch with in major TBI centers only take post-docs + a lot of neuroscience PhD programs are micro-focused, which led me to investigate clinical neuro.) The shorter timeline is an added bonus. \n\nI just received a conditional offer (fingers crossed funding comes through), but I’m wondering how a PhD at Cambridge would look coming back to the US? I have, along with my potential mentor, identified a collaborator in the US to maintain some networking in the US. Career wise, I see myself either in a hospital setting full-time research or back in industry, definitely not teaching/going for tenure. Thus, would greatly appreciate some perspective here!",

I’m a Canadian graduate student currently completing my MA in sociocultural anthropology who plans to continue with a Ph.D. (most likely also at another Canadian institution). However, I was born in the UK and grew up there before my family moved to Canada when I was 6. I’ve always been close with friends and family in the UK, visiting most years and remaining in contact with them. As a dual Canadian-British citizen, I’ve always wanted to move back, at least for a time, to see which country I prefer to live in. I’m curious to know if there are many differences between British and Canadian academia. I know in Canada, it’s relatively common for British-trained academics (at least in the field of anthropology) to teach at Canadian institutions. Would a Canadian degree be regarded as equivalent to a degree from a British university when applying for UK-based academic jobs, or would it be regarded as less desirable?",

I'm starting to think I've gone about my organization all wrong and looking for others who have been through this.\n\nMy problem: I remember articles that I know I will cite in the future, but it takes hours to find them. I can't remember 500 different authors and titles across multiple substantive areas. I started out organizing within folders in Zotero, but as that grew into subfolders with overlapping topics, I started using tags. Then that too became large and unorganized. \n\nI'm looking for something like LiquidText or MarginNote3 (although these look a little complicated) that has a workspace where I can move excerpts from multiple PDFs to a single page or space But these don't seem to sync very well with Zotero. I've been using PDF Expert for years for annotation, which syncs flawlessly with Zotero where my PDFs are stored, but maybe I shouldn't have been using Zotero for PDF storage to start with???\n\nTips? Suggestions? I don't mind paying for apps, but I'm having a hard time finding something that syncs easily with Zotero. So unless I move my files out of Zotero and organize them elsewhere, not sure not sure I have many choices. Most recently I just started keeping separate word documents for excerpts for each related topic, but then I have to open up 10+ different word documents continuously. I've heard others use Excel, but Excel doesn't seem ideal for something like this.",
