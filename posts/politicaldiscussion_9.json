Russia was [repeatedly cited as a likely culprit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/world/europe/pipeline-sabotage-mystery-russia.html), spurred on by calculated leaks from the White House—but without ever establishing a clear motive for such an act of self-sabotage, beyond simple retribution. A few months later, when it emerged that Russian authorities had been quietly getting estimates for the cost to repair the pipelines, the [New York Times described](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/world/europe/nordstream-pipeline-explosion-russia.html) the news as “complicating theories about who was behind” the attack. No major American newspaper dug into the earlier threats to the pipelines made by Biden and Undersecretary of State Nuland.\n\nWhile it was never clear why Russia would seek to destroy its own lucrative pipeline, a more telling rationale for the President’s action came from Secretary of State Blinken.\n\nAsked at a press conference last September about the consequences of the worsening energy crisis in Western Europe, [Blinken described](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-canadian-foreign-minister-melanie-joly-at-a-joint-press-availability/) the moment as a potentially good one:\n\n&gt;*“It’s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs. That’s very significant and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come, but meanwhile we’re determined to do everything we possibly can to make sure the consequences of all of this are not borne by citizens in our countries or, for that matter, around the world.”*\n\nIf true, will this cause dissonance with some of our allies and how will the world at large respond to this?\n\n [How America Took Out The Nord Stream Pipeline (substack.com)](https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/how-america-took-out-the-nord-stream) \n\n [White House says blog post on Nord Stream explosion 'utterly false' | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-says-blog-post-nord-stream-explosion-is-utterly-false-2023-02-08/)",
