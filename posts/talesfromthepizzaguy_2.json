I was coming down it like any other day to go back to the store and I get near the stop sign and see a guy sprawled out in the middle of the road blocking the way. First thought is “what the hell is this crazy guy doing....” \n\nUpon coming closer, I see he’s very hurt. I jump out of the car and run towards him. He apparently was coming down the hill on a bicycle (without a helmet) and hit a curb and flew off.\n\nThis guy had a horrible gash on his head. He was bleeding out reaaaaally bad. It was honestly a very traumatizing event. I legitimately thought he was gonna die, the sounds he made were just... *shudder*. He was clearly in a great amount of shock and bleeding heavily. His bike was mangled in the road. A few other people ran over and we all tried to calm this guy down and he kept trying to stand up and walk away and he stumbled onto his ass and almost smashed his head on the pavement.\n\nMeanwhile, cars are coming down the hill and getting backed up because we’re all trying to get this guy to the sidewalk. I ended up getting a towel from my car and they tried to calm him. The samaritans were asking the guy his name and he was in such shock, just moaning and groaning. It was petrifying. He couldn’t even speak or walk. I parked my car a few yards up the road to get outta the way and run back. Ambulances finally came but damn, such a traumatic experience. ",

        "text": "Originally posted on r/TalesFromYourServer was told to x-post here!\n\nI’m a waitress at a Chinese restaurant. \n\nWe had a normal day of orders and such. The restaurant is in neighbourhood that has mostly low income blocks so we have ran into trouble before. Many times the kids/teenagers will run in and scream even if customers are there, they will say “GIVE US OUR CAT BACK” or even meow really loudly and they would be with a group of people just filming. The worst is when these kids would throw things at our window every weekend for a year. The owners are in their 50s who do 12/h days 7 days a week, like how almost all Chinese restaurant owners do. \n\nThey have also come in and steal the utensils on the tables close to the door, or stole the candy on the desk etc. This time though, it was different, we never had this happen with a delivery.\n\nWe got a call for two of the ‘dinner for’ package meals, it resulted to about $79. They gave us an address to an apartment but said they would wait outside. It seemed normal as they were call on the phone and answered all questions and it was all normal. \n\nUntil the delivery driver came back and told us what had happened.\n\nThe driver pulled up to the building and there were two teenagers sitting outside. The driver was kinda known in the area because he often hung out at the park there, so those teens recognized him and started walking away. The driver thought nothing of it but saw no one else around so he decided to call the number that was with the delivery and it didn’t ring, turned out to be a fake number (it was also the caller ID but it was off a text app or something). That’s when those teens came back and asked if he was the delivery driver for our restaurant. They admit to him out of ‘respect’ that they were hoping a Chinese man was gonna do the delivery so that they could rob him. I don’t know if this matters but the driver is white. \n\nMy blood boiled so bad about this because most likely they thought Chinese people are weaker, maybe with the language barrier and such. But these kids are just teenagers, planning to do something this stupid. They apparently said they were hungry. That’s still no way to act. The kid got tackled by an officer at the park a week later for assault on a younger teenage female. \n\nOn days there are no available drivers, the cooks will do the delivery themselves. So I just keep imaging what if the 50 year old man in the kitchen did the delivery instead. It’s disgusting how all the participating teens treat a business, with vulgar words, trespassing, damaging property, and now attempted robbery? ",

        "text": "Lets start by saying that when I first started this job, I thought I’d only have one manager. However, there’s a total of three managers at this Pizza Hut. For this post, I’ll be referring to the manager that interviewed and hired me. The other managers are good too, but I’m talking about that one manager specifically. She’s been working here for seven years.\n\nMy manager (lets call her, Sarah), reminds me of one of my teachers in high school; and that’s good because I actually like that teacher (lets call him Bill).\n\nBill is the type that will joke with you, pick on you (playfully of course), not as uptight and not as strict. He is a joker and is pretty laid back on some of rules. He really doesn’t care what you do, as long as you’re not bothering anyone and as long as you’re getting the work done. And that is the same for Sarah.\n\nFor example, I was sitting in the office with one of the other team members (a CSR). He decided to train me on how to answer phones and how to enter orders on the computer. \n\nWell, my manager overheard the little training session. She walked by and said, “You know damn well he won’t answer the phone” then laughed. Note that she is right. I’ll rarely or never answer the phone, but I never actually told anyone that. Not sure how she knew I wouldn’t answer the phone, but I think I know. \n\nEither because I’m more laid back than the rest of the team members, there are other people that are scheduled that will answer them, or the fact that I will do literally anything else (or a combination of those three reasons). Either way, she knows I won’t answer them but I never told anyone that.\n\nAt first when she said that, I thought that’s a bad thing. But then again, I do literally everything else extremely well. Drivers here are given a bank of $20. And just yesterday, I took so many deliveries back-and-fourth on my third closing shift in a row, that I only owed the store 10 cents of the $20 bank when I banked out. Lets also keep in mind that during one of those closing shifts, I was the only driver that stayed from 10pm-12am.\n\nAnd just last week, she bought us all bottle sodas/water from the vending machine because we all had to go back-and-fourth in the HOT heat; especially in the military base for half of the deliveries and lets just say that there’s no elevators in the military base housings and buildings.\n\nI could go on with all these stuff that I will do besides answer phones, but I’ll leave it at that to make this post not as long. Anyways, who does your manager remind you of?\n",

        "text": "My store closes (stops taking orders) at 1am on the weekends. We usually start closing duties at midnight so when it's 1am we only have a few things left if there aren't a lot of orders. Tonight we had done everything except put away ingredients and mop the floors. It's been slow the last couple hours so I'm thinking that there won't be many orders during the last hour. There was one last delivery to a regular, very cool and always tips $5+. It's 12:54am and I head back to the store. As I'm driving back, in a good mood, I'm thinking that I walk in, cash out, mop, and leave at 1:01am (it's been done before, and closers usually leave around 1:30 to 2am). When I return there are 4 more deliveries. They were all ordered as I was making that last delivery. The other driver will take a double and I will take a double. I'm thinking no big deal, my double is bagged and ready to go and they're right across the street from each other. The first one is to a lady sitting outside of a bar in a shopping center. Transaction is quick and smooth. It's 1:08am when I finish the first delivery. I head to the next one which is at a Marriott hotel. The customer's instructions were to meet him in the lobby. I get there but no one is there. I call the customer, doesn't answer. 3 more calls, no answer. Text, no reply. The front desk even tries to help me out by calling the guest's room phone, but still no answer. I wait there to see if anyone comes. No one comes. I exit the hotel and head back to my car. I call one more time and he answers. He says he'll meet me in the lobby in 2 minutes. I go back to the lobby and wait. 4 minutes later he arrives with a girl. I hand them the pizza and brownies and say $23.74. They thought they paid with credit, but did not. Neither of them have cash on them. The girl goes back up to the room to get cash. She's taking a long time. I try to make small talk so there isn't awkward silence. He says he's grateful to me because no one was serving food at this hour. The girl has been gone for at least 4 minutes. He spots an ATM and gets money from there. Takes him 2 more minutes. At this point I'm thinking I'm going to get a big tip. They made me wait a long ass time, I'm the only one who has food, and they're staying at the Marriott where rooms are $285 average per night. He comes back, hands me two $20s, and asks for $14 back. I went to elementary school and know math, so I'm immediately pissed. I ended up clocking out at 1:47am. P.S. I wasn't even scheduled to close. I just stayed late to help the real closers thinking I could get them out at 1:01am. Nope.",

        "text": "Yo what up pizza people. I'm pretty new here, and I'm also new to managing, even though I've been working at the Great Hut for about a year.\n\nRecently I've become a shift manager, splitting my time between driving and running shifts, and most of my time has been spent closing. Over the past couple of weeks, I've been working on shortening the time I spend closing up shop so that I can leave on time. \n\nFor reference, the two closing drivers and myself are supposed to shut the store down an hour after we stop taking orders. But I haven't been able to beat an hour and a half. After tonight, I've realized that there pretty much has to be a tradeoff between thoroughness and timeliness. My boss wants me to clean and restock everything to a certain standard, but he also wants me out by a certain time, and I don't think there's time to do both.\n\nTo break it down (so maybe someone can give me more pointed advice) I'm supposed to clean and restock the maketable, clean out the fryer oil and wipe out the grease inside, wipe down cut table and wingstreet, refill all wingstreet sauces and cut and maketable shakers, close down the registers and finish the paperwork for the night. I've also got to make sure I do inventory sometime during the shift, or else I'm stuck doing that at the end as well. \n\nThe maketable is by far the most time consuming thing to clean, usually taking me about 45 minutes to put up all the sauces, toppings, and cheese, then cleaning it out. I always leave the thing spotless, which is how my boss showed me how to do it, and how I assume he expects it to be, but it also takes up three quarters of that hour. I talked to one of my drivers tonight, and he said that the other managers aren't as half as thorough as I am, and they're the ones who have been here for a while. Similarly, the fryer also takes a while to clean properly. \n\nOther managers: How do you handle the balance of doing things thoroughly and doing them quickly? Do you think I should skimp out on cleaning to get out of the store on time, or do you think that I'll learn how to do everything more quickly with time? Plus, I'd love to hear your managing experiences and new manager blunders and successes. \n\nThanks for reading my post pizza people. Stay saucy. ",

This one was a little more intense with it being the 1st and all. \n\n1. Dear Customer, if we’re busy and we’ve told you that wait times are high but you place the order anyways, please please please, don’t spam the store with phone calls looking for your food. Someone has to answer the phones, and we just told you that our drivers are busy...Why would it make sense to keep calling, and interrupting the efficiency of our make line?? \n\n2. If you’re on the edge of our delivery zone, and you order when we say we’re busy, chances frickin (can I swear on this sub) are, that you’re going to be waiting for about an hour. Come get it yourself if you can’t wait.  (I’m in a rural area and country back roads are filled with potholes, animals, and the occasional drunk along the sides of the road. So, ~45 is the max you can go if you wanna risk a ticket) \n\n3. This is an old one but definitely needs to be repeated, before shorter days get here. TURN ON YOUR PORCH LIGHT AND PLEASE HAVE VISIBLE NUMBERS! I went to a retirement community tonight, they had no street lights, NO number on any of the Apts., and when I called the man, he told me just go to the last building on your right and head to the apt. With the TV playing loudest. . . Like are you actually serious, my guy. \n\n3.5 and a half.  -If you do decide to place your order with high wait times, don’t fucking(who cares, the mods r probably sleeping) forget that you ordered food! There were several deliveries tonight, where I just waited for 5-7 minutes after knocking because I could hear movement or people talking, but no one making any action to answer the door. \n\nI’ve definitely had better Friday nights than this, let’s hope Saturday’s shift goes better. 👍🏻🤞🏻",

The daughter stopped me and said they didn't order and have received numerous fake orders to their house the last few days. They were real nice and wanted to find out who it was so I gave them the name and number on the ticket and went back to the store.\n\nI tried calling the number from a store phone but got no answer. I felt bad for the family and was a little pissed this kid wasted my time so I called from my cell and the kid answered. I told him I'm from pizza place and he made a fake order and needed to pay. He said \"oh shit\" laughed and hung up on me. I was pissed and bored so I tried googling his number to get a name or address but couldn't find anything. \n\nI decided to try and scare him. So I sent him a text saying if he doesn't call and pay the cops will be at his house in a little bit. It worked. His sister called back crying and saying please don't send the police her parents will pay when they get home from work and she will make sure her brother gets in trouble.\n\nLater that day his parents called and payed for the food and I'm pretty sure that kid won't make any more prank orders after this. \n\nI also got free pizza and wings out of the whole thing.",

Even with enough points on my account to cover one pie, I have to pay a delivery fee and tip on the regular price, so I may as well just got get a pizza.\n\nWe used to get \"Roman Emperor\" Pizza pretty regularly, and when we saw an add for \"meat-pie meat-pie\" on TV, figured we would give it a shot.\n\nOur local shop is never well stocked with \"Hot-N-Ready\" pizzas, and yesterday was no exception. There was nothing ready when i walked in, and a pair of older ladies in front of me, frustrated that they could not walk in and get a couple of pizzas without having to wait, but ultimately they ordered a cheese and a pepperoni, and sat to wait.\n\nI ordered my 5 Meat Treat and joined them in the waiting area.\n\nThe cashier goes to the kitchen and comes out with 2 boxes, and gestures to the two ladies as he sets them down on the counter.\n\nThe older lady pulls the top box off the stack and lifts the lid to expose a cheese pizza, as the younger woman checks the other pie, which I could not see.\n\nOL= Older Lady, YL= Younger Lady, C= Cashier\n\nOL: This isn't right. Is yours right?\n\nYL: No. \n\nOL: I can't believe they messed up our order! *closes box*\n\nOL: Young man (the cashier)! This is not what we ordered! I asked for one cheese and one pepperoni.\n\nC: Hang on. Wait. What did I give you?\n\nYL: You put pepperoni on mine! *shows him*\n\nC: Oh! Let me check.\n\nAt this point, I start to think these women know the kid and are intentionally messing with him. He was new the last time I went there, and was easily confused. In fact, the manager had to have the kitchen STOP making pizzas and start all of them over due to the confusion he had caused, so I thought it was kind of mean.\n\nI watched his face as he opened the box the older lady had pushed across the counter at him, which contained a cheese pizza.\n\nC: I don't know how this happened. I'm so sorry.\n\nI just busted out laughing and the kid looked confused, while the ladies just looked mad. Suddenly the older lady has this \"lightbulb\" moment, grabs the box back, and stacks them back up and picks up the stack.\n\nYL: But...\n\nOL: Get the door. \n\n\n",

        "text": "So I delivered yesterday to a bar.  Not to the staff, but to a drunk AT the bar.  1:30pm, he was the only customer in the bar.  \n\nMe, walking in - \"Hi, i've got a delivery for XXXX\"\nDrunk Customer (sitting at bar with pile of bills in front of him) \"How'd you know my name?\"\nMe - (looks around at empty bar) \"Just a guess man.  You order pizza?\"\nDC gets up, gives me a hug, says he loves me and my pizza, asks me to open the box and show it to him.  I do.  He compliments me and my pizza and hands me the stack of bills on the counter.  His total was 26 and change, i saw at least a 20, a 10, and a couple singles, I figure it's all counted out and ready.\n\nI thank DC, take the money, and start out the door.\n\nBartender (one of two, i later find out this one was the owner) stops me.  \"Hey, how much was the total?\"  GRABS the money out of my hand, looks at the receipt and hands me back 31.  Puts the rest back in front of DC, I can see there was a 5 and a few more ones.  \n\nSo basically, the bartender just got involved in my transaction, and decided how much of a tip I got.  On the one hand, he could be looking out for his customer, who was obviously too drunk to be fully functioning.  On the other hand, he could be trying to keep the money in the bar for himself and the other bartender.  DC might have been legitimately trying to give me a $14 tip (i guessed pile of cash was $40 originally).  \n\nAs a bartender, serving drinks to take money from drunk people is your game.  As a pizza guy, getting drunk people to give you money is ALSO your game.  I walked away feeling like I'd been stolen from (although i did get my average, $5 tip, so can't really complain).\n\nThoughts, fellow drivers?  What would you have done in my spot?\n\nEDIT - In response to the folks saying \"you suck caz you're too slow putting away money\" i had maybe 3 seconds to check it was there before he grabbed it out of my hand.  Then, rather than make a fuss in front of the customer (because i respect my store and my job) i chose to walk out confused and a few bucks shorter.\n\nUPDATE - Today, I called to ask for the owner, asked if I could come in to talk to him about the situation.  He started yelling that I was taking advantage of his drunk customer.  Then said I could come in to get $5 from him to make it right, but that I was never allowed into the bar after that, even for deliveries.  Then he called my store and started yelling at my manager that i was trying to steal from his customers.  Then he called me to explain that the pile of money was meant to cover both the pizza AND the two drinks the customer had bought, spinning it so that if I had taken the entire pile, he would have not gotten HIS money.  Then he said that I was NOT allowed to come to the bar, that he would instead come to my restaurant and leave the money for me there, and that I was never allowed into his bar again.  This all happened at the end of my morning shift, he hadn't appeared when I clocked out.  Hopefully more updates to follow. ",

        "text": "I've been interacting with customers in the service industry for 20 years, and one thing I've noticed change during that time is that customers in general seem to have a greater sense of entitlement.  A certain percentage of customers seem very easily offended.  It's now more common to see customers become offended and angry over relatively inconsequential and trivial things.\n\nI take pizza orders over the phone.  I can usually quickly gauge a customer's mood, so I know if I should act more friendly and lighthearted, or keep it strictly professional.  And most customers are perfectly fine, and we have satisfactory interactions.  But some people have a suspicious, adversarial attitude from the moment they get on the phone, like they're looking for trouble.  And then if we do encounter a problem (if, for instance, I refuse to let them order a half thin crust half thick crust), they go ballistic.  It's a surreal situation, because the response is so out of proportion to the problem.\n\nThis weekend I had a customer become angry because I ask her to repeat a list of toppings.  I got on her wrong side right away for some unknown reason, so she was talking down to me, speaking fast and not making an effort to enunciate.  When I asked her to repeat the toppings, she accused me of being disrespectful.  I denied intending to offend, but she actually got mean.  At the end, she said she'd have my job, and asked to be transferred to my manager.  All our calls are recorded, so I'm sure my manager listened to the call, but I never heard anything back, so I guess that means I still have to go to work.  :P\n",

        "text": "Ok, I know posted here earlier today but MAN I just had a weird night and have to share.\n\nIt all started well enough, first few deliveries were fine. Things started getting weird when I got to a house and a girl answered the door with one boob hanging out of her tank top. I don’t know if I interrupted something or what, but it was real awkward. She quickly noticed and pulled her shirt back up, but by then my eyes were glued to the ticket because I couldn’t make eye contact anymore.  She wordlessly handed me a wad of money and I quickly left.\n\nA few normal hours went by and it got dark outside. A ticket came in and I ended up taking an order (boneless wings and a 20 oz sprite, only like $14 of food) to a sketchy neighborhood. The ticket said “go around to the in-law apartment on the left,” but I couldn’t even find the house at first. I had to park on the street and wander through two front lawns until I found the right house. It’s important to mention I had locked my phone in my car at this point. \n\nI go around the side and knock on the door and a heavyset (and very clearly drunk) woman answers the door and says, “He’s just getting the money! He’ll be right down!” before closing the door again. My driver senses are already tingling- this doesn’t feel right at all. Also I can’t see my car or the street from the side of the house, which is something that always makes me uneasy.\n\nFinally this guy comes to the door with no shirt on, reeking of the devil’s lettuce. Dude seems real jittery. I tell him the total and he hands me bill and says “Here’s 20, can I get $2 back?”. Immediately I doubted that it was really a $20 bill, but because it was pitch black and I had left my phone in the car, I had no light source and had to give him the benefit of the doubt. Of course, after I got back to my car and looked, I saw that it was actually a one dollar bill. I didn’t go back to ask for the correct amount of money because the whole situation felt so sketchy, and when I got back to the restaurant I explained what had happened to the manager. \n\nShe ended up calling them and they claimed I dropped the $20 on the ground, which is bullshit because I had the bill that he had given me IN MY HAND when I got back into my car. The manager eventually sent another driver to collect the money (which I thought was totally inappropriate and potentially dangerous), and apparently this other driver somehow strongarmed them into paying up. I should mention this other driver is a very tough, strong willed lesbian woman who doesn’t take shit from anyone, so the mental image of her heading over there and exacting some justice is pretty funny. (She’s a great person and a great coworker, just to add.) \n\nShe ended up bringing me the $20 and I did all her side work for her. It ended well and now I can laugh about it, but what an odd night it was. \n\nTL;DR: Saw boobies and then someone tried to pull a fast one on me. Coworker ended up bailing me out. ",

They came to the door right away and left it wide open while the guy went to get the cash and their dachshund came out to check me out.  Then I heard them talking back and forth and saw them repeatedly crossing the end of the entryway. The dog kept moving to walk away from the front door and I would tell him to go back inside. He would but then he would come out again.\n\n   So like 7 minutes of this and the dude comes out and runs to his car, and the girl tells me she had a 20 but couldn't find it, they had the total(38.70) but nothing for a tip.  Then the guy comes up holding this glasses case overflowing with quarters and asks if I want it, it's all quarters. I'm no dummy so I say \"Sure!\"  They toss it in a baggy and I head back.  I counted up the quarters and gold dollars(!) And it ended up being $35.55 total!  Not sure they knew how many quarters fit in a glasses case.\n\n   Then the other driver got back and asked if I enjoyed his delivery to which I answered an enthusiastic \"Yes!\" And he bragged he got 8 dollars from my regular and how much did I get? I answered 35 bucks, mostly because I don't like him much. He called me an Asshole, and I went out on my next delivery. \n\nMy best tip was 40 from the dad of a rich girl turning 21, but that was on a 14 pizza order.",

Always getting drugs delivered to his place though.\"  (note, CB didn't work here back then as I used to take this guys order /all/ the time and he would always ask for a discount. Cut a brotha some slack etc.)\n\nLittle did I know TB was CBs brother. Oops.\n\nLater on as we finished up closing, CB approached me tossing his shirt on the ground. I ignored the action and walked past \"What? You just gonna talk all that shit about my brother and not fight me? Fucking pussy.\" I ignored him, got into my car and with the door open so that I could talk to the driver next to me as we all usually sit outside together.\n\nCB began to circle my car as we talked, still throwing out slurs and names at me as I ignored him, as he began to approach my car on the side and near the door  I calmly turned my phones camera on and pointed it towards him and caught a little bit of his anger, before he spoke out \"Aw man this little bitch gonna record me, what a fucking pussy.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't expect management to be much help, as there really isn't any management. It's a mom and pop shop that is ran rather poorly. The money is just too good here to pass up.  Not sure where to really go, I don't feel like police would be any help.",

I tried looking it up online too but can’t get a straight answer. So my question is, do you guys get paid below minimum wage while on the road? Where I live, I make 9.25 while in store and 6 while on the road. I worked at a few big chains and they seem to be all the same around where I live. But do you guys make minimum wage all the time +tips? And if so, how much is your minimum out there. I’ve heard some places it’s $13 and others it’s $10 so I’m just looking to get a little more info before I move out there and transfer to my new store. Thanks in advance for any info",

I'm usually a chill guy, but if I'm forced to stop delivering and work the oven, I can get short with people. \n\nFridays are usually hectic but the morning was nice enough that we got prep done quick and even had time to just kick back and watch some TV for a little. I work in an Italian restaurant that does slices to order, but from 6 to 8 during our rush, we don't, cause it's a bitch to go make a slice when I can just stretch a pizza fast enough, plus if someone comes in and can't get a 4 dollar slice, they'll pay for a 14 dollar pizza.\n\nAnywho this counter girl was fucking up all day and was starting to get to me. She was constantly failing to send tickets through, getting orders terribly wrong, and pulling down tickets from the makeline that hadn't been made yet. \n\nDuring the worst of the rush, two guys come in and try to order slices, one girl tells them, sorry we don't do slices right now, they're cool and say they'll just get a pizza, when the dingbat chimes in and says, \"oh I'll just take the order and make them myself!\" \n\nNow we're a small restaurant with an even smaller kitchen. For her to get into the make line between me and the other guy stretching would be an extreme inconvenience, I tell her how dumb she is to have done that and that she should've just sold the pizza, to which she hisses, \"the customer is here and they're going to leave, and I said I'd make them!\" \n\nWhich, bitch, they're eight feet from me, they didn't say shit, and get your grimy ass back, you don't make pizzas, you don't even have your food handlers card, due to a recent shutdown over a non existent owners permit, an infraction over no serv safe is the last thing we need. \n\nI make the goddamn slices, deal with her bitch attitude, and the pizza guy tells me he's sick of the girls shit and is gonna talk to the owner. Now I agree in full, but we were cool in the past til she became dead weight about a week ago. I was like, \"look ill talk to the owner about her fucking up, and maybe hell just cut her hours back.\" I walk out back and make the call. \n\nCue the phone ringing, her answering and just screeching, \"YOU CAN'T JUST FIRE ME FOR FUCKING UP! FINE! FUCK YOU I QUIT!\" \n\nI was like damn, didn't mean to get her fired, and id feel bad if she weren't such a total bitch. \n\nBut then I got back to delivering and caught an 18 dollar tip, so I was like yeeeee.",

I decided to take a quick shower and equipped my younger sister with the cash, just in case the delivery man arrives before I'm out. He a few minutes before the expected delivery time and although I was out of the shower, I wasn't presentable so my sister went ahead and paid him $20 while the order was $19.80. Silly me forgot to put the tip next to the door and by the time I got downstairs, he was gone.\n\n​\n\nMy sister is telling me to let it go and not feel guilty, but I can't help but feel horrible. I can't call right now because the store is currently closed. I was thinking of possibly stopping by the store either tomorrow or the following day to see if I could leave a tip (it's not really out of my way since it's very close to the Gym I go to weekly). I obviously don't know his name or how he looks so I'm not sure if the individual will get the tip even if I were to stop by.\n\nI'm rather anxiety prone so these type of things can keep me up at night.  I have also heard tales of some employees do to those who don't tip (i.e getting the delivery cold, possible immoral actions towards the food)\n\nAny suggestions on what I can do? Also, how much do you think I should tip him If I am to get a hold of him.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated\n\n​\n\nUPDATE: I wanted to resolve the issue before University started for me again, because I knew I'll most likely be too busy to drop by that general area. Today I went to the location, I ordered a deal from the menu and then explained the situation from that evening. The manager was very nice and took at least  5 minutes looking through the computer to track down my order and who took the delivery. After getting the name of the delivery man, I asked when is he next expected to show up for work. Given that I do have class during his next work shift, I asked if I could leave the tip for him. The manager was kind enough to allow me to leave the tip in an envelop with a receipt from that night and a small note.  Another employee was there as witness. The manager was very thankful that I came in and seemed like a decent person, I also tipped him for his helping nature.. Hopefully the tip gets to the delivery guy. Thank you for all the advice.\n\n​",

Well the competition noticed my work shirt hanging up and asked if I would be interested in making a switch. I had admittedly thought about it, but I didn't think any offer would come right to me. An interview later, our competition offered me a set schedule, a mix of shifts, and a raise in pay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took this offer back to my current employer to give them a chance to match for the sake of fairness, and they agreed to match everything, except for the pay.

I accepted this and was weighing my options, and it was a fairly close competition, until last night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night they stuck me with a new guy, because training is so much easier during dinner rush apparently. During the course of conversation we were discussing pay and I found out he is making $3 more per hour than me. That sealed the deal for me, I was just told the day before they can't more pay, and some random guy with no experience starts off making more than me.

        "text": "So there I was yesterday at Lizza Jut when we had been getting constant deliveries all day on top of all the other stores being inspected so we were quite busy making sure that everything was up to snuff. \n\nOne of my orders that I’ve already delivered to, 10 minutes driving away, decides to call us and say we forgot a soda even though they never ordered one. Manager says screw them and have me take the soda last on my next batch of deliveries. I finally do the others and get about $5 each so that paid for my gas all the way to this lady’s house. \n\nI get there and no one is home. I knock 3-4 times and no one answers. I call my manager and say that I’m leaving the soda on the doorstep because I’m sick of driving so much to this one persons house. 40 minutes of my shift shouldn’t be for one order. He approves it and tells me I got 2 more deliveries when I get back and they’ve hit an hour each. \n\nI pickup the next 2 deliveries and make my way to the first house. Thankfully they are within 5 minutes of the store and within a minute of each other. Now this is the part that could’ve gone wrong in a lot of ways. \n\nI show up to the first place and see a good sized group(3-5) of those “let me speak to your manager” women and I sign so hard driving up. I get out and they have their arms crossed and look pissed. I’m at about an hour and 20 minutes late so I prepare myself to be yelled at. \n\nI do my normal “hey how’s it going? Nice weather huh?” And they sort of grumble and one of them, who is holding a large Hank Williams Whiskey(?) bottle says that she’s leaving and will see them later. I hand the payer the credit slips and when things are tense I try to diffuse the situation by cracking a joke. \n\n“Dude, I was really hoping that that alcohol was my tip”. I smile and begin to take the pizzas out and wait for the light chuckle I’m usually met with but all these ladies just began cackling so hard. The lady took back the credit slips and changed the tip from a $3 tip to a $5 which is considered great at my store. They all wish me a good day and I book it to my last delivery, who gave me a $6 tip, and then head back. \n\nI get back to the store and sort of brag about my joke to my dope ass manager and he was laughing just as hard as the ladies were and then told me “you got 2 more deliveries in the oven.” I smiled and went back to driving with a large grin on my face the rest of the shift.

I think this is pretty odd, and try to shake him off; but he literally walks me to my car and tries to open my door for me.

I deliver to this hoarder woman 2 to 3 times a week (I know her by name now). She opens the front door of her apartment and a waft of the most putrid stench hits my face. I see behind her stacks of hundreds of 32oz styrofoam cups from various food establishments. I can smell the alcohol on her breath. Every time she asks for the same total in her slurred voice and every time I tell her the same total. With the same two sides of ranch and extra cheese and peppers on the side. She always gives me a dollar or two in coins for a tip though, bless her poor straining heart. I can't help but wonder how many others are out there like her. To date, she has spent over 8,000 dollars at our pizza place, not including the tips, in a span of a year and a half. This job has been eye opening in that regard. I have met some pretty unpleasant people and some really nice people. The extremes of which are jarring however. I think about this regular a lot. About how we came to have this weird front door relationship. How is this crossroad in each of our lives going to end? Will I see the day she stops ordering? What will have happened to her? I want to ask her how she got to that point in her life. Where she is satisfied with the way things are going for her. I have drinking problems as well. I feel like I understand her in many ways. But in others I am at a loss. I am probably thinking too much about my part time pizza delivery job. I just wanted to share.",

I’m the only one who speaks English as a first language between the kitchen/ management. I started in January driving, but recently I’ve been cooking more. I still take deliveries but I also cook to help out when things get hairy, my hourly increases to a nice $12/hour plus whatever tips I receive when driving and cooking. \n\nSounds decent right? May I add that this is the worst store of the 5ish stores, it is poorly managed, things are very unsanitary, and to be honest it’s all kinda shady.. but I’ve also knocked doors in the dead of winter as a salesmen for the experience, I can play ball.\n\nI heard back from an awesome job that I’ve been waiting on that requires a 3 month residency in Monterey CA, which is huge for myself and my better half as we’ve been running a production company on the side and with this job we can finally start a life.. \n\nI’m moving out of my parents house, we’re looking at houses, and things are looking up a bit. \n\nAt the store, I’m serving out my two weeks because thats what I always do, but my boss is making my life miserable.. I’m no longer cooking, my checks are getting smaller, all my deliveries are 15-20 minutes away with very small orders (one small pie at $11.65), and he’s assigning me some pointless nonsensical tasks, it feels all out of spite. I don’t need the job, I’ve treated this guy with nothing but respect, I’m always 15-30 minutes early, and can say I’m one of the more reliable people there.. \n\nToday was the last straw. I stayed late and prepped a catering order last night, over $300 worth of food for the first delivery of the day.. I arrive early to find it’s been given to the other driver, who wasn’t even there yet... I brush it off because it’s my last day. \n\nI go on a couple runs, shit-tips galore.. but behold, another catering comes through, this time for $400. Right under a $50 order that I knew was going to be the other guy’s, or so I thought. I look at the ticket, and look at the manager and tell him I’ll be back. I had time, it was a lot of food.. but I come back only to find that I’m being given the $50 order and the other driver (as his second delivery) is waiting on the $400 one. \n\nI looked at my manager, looked at the queue, looked back at the manager, took off my work shirt, threw it in the trash, told him I’d see him payday, and walked. \n\n\nEnd rant. \n\n\n\n\n",

So I give him another dollar thinking he'll go and get 56 cents in change to give me. I've already accepted the fact that I'm not being tipped. When I give him the 4th dollar he says, \"have a nice day\" and starts to close the door. So I lost 56 cents on that order.\n\n2) No show. I knock on the door for 2 minutes. Then I call 3 times. No answer. So I drive back to the store. A coworker offers to call him again. The customer answers on the first ring. I have another order ready for me but it's going in the opposite direction. I tell my coworker he can take my no show if his next order is near his direction. It ends up being so and he gets tipped $10.\n\n3) My next delivery mentioned in #2, stiff. No tip. If my no-show delivery had gone smoothly, I would have made it back in time to the store to take the delivery before this one. \n\n4) Delivery to an assisted living facility at 11pm to one of the nurses. I get there and the entrances are automatic sliding doors that need a code to get into at night. Fortunately, an employee let me in with her code after I stood there for a minute. Then she calls the nurse that ordered the pizza. I wait another minute. The nurse pays for the pizza and I turn back to exit the building. The sliding doors won't open. Apparently you need a code to also exit the building as well. I assume so the residents can't leave the premises at night. I turn around to see if the nurses are there but they all left. I go to where I think she went to and open the door but a loud alarm goes off. So now I assume all the doors are connected to an alarm. I'm stuck in the building. I keep knocking on all the doors to get someone's attention. I'm there for probably 4 minutes knocking on doors like a maniac. Finally, someone hears my knocking and let's me out. The tip was $4.25.\n\nI get back and an order is ready for me. It's near the end of my shift so I tell my manager to cut me. With my recent luck, I'm done with deliveries for the night. I do dishes as my side work and someone else takes my delivery. When he gets back, he tells me he was tipped $12.\n\nI made $3.69 in my last 2 hours of work.",

        "text": "Hello, \n\nI am a 24 year old white male who moved to a town 10 min out of Detroit. I have decided to become an Uber eats driver and last night was my first experience. Detroit is a predominantly black community. The high crime is due to the poverty there and is no way shape or form because of their race. Just making that clear. I was concerned last night though because I was in some super sketchy neighborhoods and for a 11 pm on a Tuesday night there were a surprising amount of people outside and on porches. When I would get out to deliver people would stop what they are doing and just stare at me. One guy even started to walks towards me from across the street while looking at me before I got in my car and drove off. I am not sure if this is because I’m white or what. Maybe they didn’t recognize my car. I suppose I just want to know if anyone has experience in crime ridden area like this and if I am endangering myself. Please don’t take this as me being racist, I only mention skin color because I think it makes me stick out. ",

        "text": "So I work for a big pizza chain and recently have been getting very annoyed with customers. Normally answering the phone is no issue for me. But just within the past month or so, We’ve been getting a lot of calls from people. They call and as soon as I pick up the phone, they’re asking “what deals do you guys have?” “What specials are on for today?” “Do you have any pizza and ____ combo deals?” Now I normally wouldn’t get upset about this, but ALLLLL of our deals are listed on our website. Most of them are online only so you HAVE to order online to get the deal. A simple google search of just our company name will bring you to our website where deals are literally thrown in your face. I can understand if you don’t have access to the internet, but pretty much all calls we get are off smartphones so there should be no excuse. I’m just a little peeved that I’m having so much of my time wasted giving people info they have at their fingertips. Literally about 30 minutes of each day is wasted just telling people what they already know. Just yesterday, someone calls and it goes like this “Hello thank you for calling (big chain), how can I help you?” \n“Do you guys have any super deals??”\n“Um....I’m not sure. But all of our deals are listed online and most are online only, so you have to order online to get that deal”\n“Oh. Ok. Well, what about that $7.99 large pizza??”\n“it says on the website it’s online only, carry out only”\n“Oh OK! Thanks!” *click*\nThis happens at least 10 times a day, and most calls usually last 3-5 minutes because customers want each deal explained to them in detail. Anyone else have this problem or get annoyed with it? Or is it just me? Haha\n\n\n",

        "text": "Driveways are a major hazard on deliveries, because backing out of them can cause problems, especially at night when you can't see the mailbox or the ditch. Sometimes, though, you get forced to because it's a busy road or something, which just reaffirms why I hate it. \n\n1. There's this customer that orders occasionally that tips 2 bucks each time. She lives in a duplex up a hill off the side a kind of busy road (double yellow line) where there's nowhere to pull off. I always end up scraping my bumper backing out of her driveway because it's so steep and my car is low to the ground. The last time I delivered to her she didn't arrive until after I did, so I had to wait for her to back out before I could leave. \n\n2. Another late night delivery, to a new customer. The delivery went smoothly enough, but after I'd backed out, I noticed a large dog had been sitting next to the mailbox that hadn't been there when I pulled in. Two inches off and I would've squashed him. That one still haunts me.\n\n3. This last guy orders fairly frequently, and he lives down a hill off a busy road. There's no easy way to get out of his driveway, so you have to gun it in reverse to get back up the hill. I overshot the power I needed one time and had one tire go in the ditch on the other side (no damage). So that was fun. ",

That caught my attention, but I completely forgot she said since I was busy with dishes.\n\nSo I thought no more of it until I got paid. I literally got paid just a few minutes ago, and it is not that big of a difference from my first paycheck and I suspect that I did something wrong when it clocked out.\n\nI worked almost 10 hours more than my first pay check and it is not that much more in this paycheck. \n\nMaybe something about entering in my tips at clock out, or selecting yes/no for a certain question at clock, etc etc. I don't know. I don't know what it is, but I'm hoping that one of you guys might know this possible trick.",

        "text": "Hello fellow drivers, I am a petite girl in my mid 20s who’s been delivering pizza for 5 1/2 years. My mother owns the pizza shop and I’m lucky enough to choose my hours and days, however she has been trying to get me to quit ever since I started. I originally filled in for someone who had left and I just begged to keep the position because of the insane tips and freedom from the kitchen. \nShe definitely needs me because we are short staffed and I work four 12 hour shifts per week as the only driver on those days  (I also go to school full time.) But her and everyone else keeps saying how dangerous of a job it is and while I do agree, I think I’m savvy enough (and armed enough) to handle it. \n\nA few years back, a drunk man ran past me and took my keys out of my car and would not give them back. He yelled at me for almost an hour and said he was going to “teach me a lesson” because I didn’t follow his vague parking instructions perfectly.  Eventually he gave me my keys back and luckily the events didnt escalate further than a screaming match in the driveway.  I made a rookie mistake and wasn’t aware of my car while it was running but I had no idea he’d jog past me off his porch and straight to my car. \nAnyways the police ended up coming and I didn’t want to take him to court cause I’ve never been and don’t feel like its worth the hassle although im almost positive that taking someone’s keys and not allowing them to leave  counts as kidnapping in my state haha\n\nThere’s been a few other weird occasions but over the years I have created a set of rules for myself. We don’t really have a strict policy since my family owns the place.  I carry a sweet bat in my passenger seat, a few knives, pepper spray and a taser although not all at the same time. I’m applying for my LTC in a few months but that’s a whole different convo.  \n\nAnyways to get to the point I was just wondering if anyone wanted to share their thoughts on this topic or has a dangerous encounter they’d like to share! \nThanks! ✌️♥️🍕",

        "text": "Just found this sub and this happened to me about a year ago. \n\nSo i was doing a delivery, really standard stuff. The order said the customer wanted to pay by card so i bought the EFTPOS machine to the door. Then i heard the shouting behind the door. At that moment i knew what i had to do. Get them to tap the card, hand over the pizza and get the fuck outa there. \n\nSo i knock on tbe door and this woman answers, she shoves a $50 note at me, i tell her i'll have to go to the car and get the money bag. She yells at me screaming \"why the fuck didn't you do that first!?\" Another woman came up behind her, pushed her asside (pretty violently too) and shoved her card out \"here! I'm paying!\" I handed back the money and held out the EFTPOS for her to tap it. I had to get out ASAP. \n\nThey were both yelling all the while. But the card was tapped, the woman who wanted tok pay wuth cash was yelling at me and insulting me as i handed over the pizza which the card woman took. After this i just turned and went back to the car. \n\n5 minutes later im back at the shop and the boss is just hanging up the phone from that last delivery. Apparently they said *I* was being rude and yelling at THEM! The boss just facepalmed and said she'd have to talk to me about it at the end of the shift. I knew i was in for it and understandably angry that i was being lied about by a customer. So i did the next couple deliveries. 15 minutes later i'm back at the shop (i dont mess around, i value efficiancy) and apparently that bitch called again and claimed the pizza gave her food poisoning!... this was less than 20 minutes after it was handed to them. And it was cooked to the same degree as every other pizza and we never before got such complaints. So either she ordered something shes violently alergic to, or she's talking out of her ass. \n\n15 minutes to closing time one of them came into the shop and started yelling at my coworkers. Accusing us of being thieves, poisoners and the like. Thankfully her antics attracted the attention of some cops who were getting some fish &amp; chips next door. And after they came in she left. Apparently she seemed to have a history with them. \n\nAt the end of my shift the boss realized i wasn't being rude, she's just a crazy bitch so i didn't get the lecture i was told i'd get. And their address has been blacklisted from future deliveries. \n\nSo... yeah. Some people can go fuck themselves. ",
