        "text": "You won't believe how many years all I've thought about was how alone I am and no one liking me. It got to the point where I developed the assumption that no one likes me, and I don't trust people enough to really open up to them.\n\nScratch that - I do open up to people, but I listen. I'm always seeking reassurance, approval language, and always trying to grab their interest towards me. I'm so use to people in the past convincing me I'm such an idiot, that I developed the habit that socializing is like taking a test. I have to win their approval before I can feel truly connected to someone. \n\nIt's not until recently I realized how inconsiderate I am. A coworker friend opened up to me a lot, and all I ever did was share how I had similar experiences or trying to solve their problems. I'm always trying to come off as a problem solver or like I want to be looked up to. My biggest mistake I realize is about what they are seeking. I don't compliment them, or empathize. I never say anything that makes them feel heard or approved of, in a way I don't show how much I care about them. All I care about is their approval, and so that's why I never feel a real connection. \n\nI'm so bad at this though, it's hard for me to find the right thing to say to make them feel respected and heard. If I did, it would come off insincere.\n\nI make everything about me, and in a sense all I worry about when I make a mistake in the relationship is \"do they hate me now?\" \"how can i stop them from hating me?\" \"am I going to get in trouble?\" etc. you get the point. \n\nThat thought process is constant in my head. It brings me back to times when I met a truly great person, and what they said to me to make me feel heard and cared about. I do none of that myself, because I'm so insecure all I focus on in socializing is \"winning\" the person over... It's as if I'm playing a game to get the prize of this connection, in which I will be able to feel like a friend and do said things that make me one. \n\nI always fear coming off like a creep, or too desperate, instead of just realizing that that person or persons is a human being who is willing to share headspace with you on something. I should appreciate that. \n\nPlus, this fear easily turns into not liking people, and becoming a hermit.\n\nI've had multiple friends yell at me \"not everything is about you!\" and I use to take offense to that, because I felt it was a dismissal of my issues or problems in the moment, especially pertaining to my friend. They may be having a bad day, or got fired, or are embarrassed of something they did or said, or are depressed... Here I am, being the stupid asshole wondering if I did anything wrong to upset them.\n\nYou know what sucks about learning social skills? You can't just buckle down right away and train yourself. I could go out and learn to skateboard right now, but when it comes to people you can't just grab them and ask them to waste their time talking to you and giving you experience to try new things. Also, when you do go out, if you mess up it can really make things more difficult to even socialize more, like your place of work or a group of friends. \n\nWhat's the best way to keep track of all of this, and things you've learned? I thought about keeping a journal, but there has to be a better way to keep track of epiphanies that you can use when the time arises...",

        "text": "Hey all. First time poster so if this belongs somewhere else then just let me know. But here's my dilemma.\n\nSo, I was contacted by my advisor that there was a cancellation for the annual retreat that they go to every year. I'm flying there, and since I took the spot of girl who cancelled, I will be in my own room due to pairing issues (rooming isn't co-ed even though this is for a graduate program). There's around 60 of us going.\n\nMy problem is, I'm horrible at making new friends. I just don't \"draw\" people towards me and I'm not the most extroverted person there is. I'm more standoffish but I am very warm and open once you get to know me. Idk if it's social anxiety or what, but I am not looking forward to the fact that I don't know anybody who is going to be there, and I don't want to be in this resort town alone without anybody to hang out with for five days...\n\nI'm the kind of person who won't introduce themselves to others because I don't want to trouble/bother them, especially if they're already in a group. But I also don't know if I'll even be able to find other people on the retreat in the first place because I'm in my own room, so by default I'm already on my own from the start.\n\nI've kept high school friends up to this point mostly. I've made friends in other places (I've done seasonal work) but we were constantly around each other, so it was easy, and it was for several months. The problem is, we all were from different places so those great connections I made are now just digital. This is a 5-day retreat, and nobody is obligated to socialize with me. Does anybody have any tips as to how I could approach people to make myself seem welcoming/not aloof/standoffish? I know it's just my personality, but I don't know how to be extroverted without being annoying. This applies to my life in general as I never get invited to do anything with the friends I do have because we have different priorities now but we still talk over text and such. I just need tips to be more social so I don't feel like an outcast on both this trip and life in general. Sorry it's a rant, but I always feel better when I type out my exact thoughts as they come through my mind. Cheers.",

        "text": "I   have a classmate named Jack. We were once good classmates, but as time     went on, we drifted apart. I've now noticed that Jack tends to act   much   friendlier with me while working together outside our classmates'    views.  He's willing to talk to me and laugh with me, unlike when   we're  in  class, where he would sometimes insult and mock my behavior.   Jack  acted  entirely differently when we were in school, and for some   time, I   couldn't figure out the reason why. Maybe he needed someone  to  laugh   with during work, but as I thought more about the topic, I   realized he   was manipulating me.\n\nWe   weren't reasonably close in 8th grade a few years ago when we first   met; I   couldn't indulge in online games with him and his friends due   to the   restrictions my parents put on me. He would advise me on how to   act   socially, and I took his advice, assuming he had no intention of   giving   me bad advice. I took him for a friend, but he didn't   reciprocate. A  few  years passed, and nothing much changed; he would   tell me jokes and make  me laugh at times, but we were never friends.   However, friend-like  his  behavior was.\n\nDuring   work  this  year, he was hot and then cold. His treatment made me look   forward  to  working with him. My dopamine levels would rise and then   fall,  looking  forward to the rise again when we would work together.   The  weirdest  thing Jack would do was speak highly of me during  school,   which was a  complete 180 from what I was used to. He was   unpredictable  and made me  feel special at times. We once even gave   each other  personal information  about one another in a long   conversation about our  troubles, which led  me to believe we became   closer and more like  friends. I was wrong to  think this. Lately, he's   decided to act nice to  me, by supporting me  when being annoyed by   others, but consider this  as anything special,  seeing his past   behavior.\n\nAs I said above, the   thought lingered, but I didn't want to commit to anything without   evidence. It was a youtube video on manipulation that   led me to   believe Jack was manipulating me. It was truly eye-opening,   realizing I   was right about his actions.\n\nNow,    I aim to understand what I can do to stop this manipulation and show     him I'm no longer interested in his games. Are there any books or   online   resources that I can use to better myself on this front? Should   I aim   to get back at him or keep my distance? How should I act  around  him now   that I know this?\n\nTLDR:   I am  being manipulated by a classmate, who I've known for some time   now,  during  work he treats me like a friend, we tell one another   jokes,  while at  school he tends to mock and insult my behavior, lately   he has  been  supporting me, but I don't consider this as noteworthy,    considering his  past behavior. I'd like to be guided in what way I  can   better myself.",

It seems like most of my coworkers spend more time chit chatting then doing anything productive.  Pisses me off truthfully, and I expect my boss to expect less work from me as I become more friends with him, as that seems to be the trick. \n\n2) Do you hop right from one cubicle to the next?  Or do you get up, walk to a cubicle, talk, then walk back to your cubicle, pause for 20 minutes, and repeat?  Or is it more start at row 1A and just keep walking and circling around at random until you run out of folks to talk to?  Because I sit in my cubicle all day I don't see the normal movements of the social folks.\n\n3) Is it worth taking notes about people?  Like birthdays, anniversaries, kids names?  I know there are social butterflies at the office who have asked me if I am married and/or have children multiple times...it's actually kind of annoying that I have to tell them more than once, is this a common thing to just ask the same question over and over again?  Is there like an unwritten rule for how often you can ask someone if they are married...would they not be impressed if I remembered their kids names and ages and what color hair their wife had, or does that come across as way creepy from the antisocial coworker who has started to talk to you all of a sudden?\n\n5)  This is like the 4th place I work where everyone shares memes and stuff between each other on their cell phones, but I have never even been asked for my phone number to become part of the meme chats...does that just come naturally with making work acquaintances, or is it like something you have to ask to be apart of?\n\n4) Feel free to drop any youtube videos, podcasts, websites, books, infographics, whatever that you have on work socializing, especially for the purpose of going from a worker bee to a leader bee.  I have busted my ass to become an amazing programmer, and will put forth the same effort in succeeding in being an amazing leader, so anything you share with me will be put to good use. \n\nI understand I am a very boring person, with no hobbies outside of going to work and coming home.  I feel like this is what engineers used to be, it was expected, but now all of a sudden it seems like social skills are more important than knowing how to write code.  So, it's time to change with the times. \n\nThanks all!",

        "text": "I made a group of friends at the start of 2021. The four other girls know eachother since 10+ years ago and they are 2 pair of best friends.\nI never had many drama and was comfortable in the group. \nA month ago we planned a summer trip. I had a good time but I felt a lot of stress in the trip. It's different things to hang out for a couple of hours than being 10 days together. \n\nThere where some small disagreements over trivial things like I felt it wasn't fair to wash the dishes alone because in their logic I was the only one that didn't help with cooking(they had made plain store bough spaghetti with olive oil and I had helped to set the table), or when  I asked to not pay a share of a fruit they bought and I don't eat and was extremely expensive(they knew I couldn't eat it before buying it) etc. \nI don't feel I was extremely in the wrong or in the right in this, I felt like they knew eachother for a long time and knew their downsides of their personalities and were far more accepting of them and they weren't so much of my personality. \nI tried my best to give my opinion without it being a tense situation but I felt everything was understood as an attack while they were able to say exactly the same things and be seen as the friendliest reminder. \nI honestly ended the trip feeling like I needed some time away from them but that after that everything would go back to normal. We said our good-byes friendlily.\nWell, three weeks went by and they were barely talking on the group chat and hadn't hang out once. I started getting suspicious but didn't do anything. \nFinally yesterday my suspicions were confirmed as one of them posted a picture of them all eating together. \nToday the group chat looked like this:\nme: are you hanging out without me? \nfriend one: yes \nfriend two: yes, everything ended up a little weird after the trip.\nme:why? \nfriend three: I didn't like some of your attitudes on the trip and it's sad but I rather take some time apart.\nfriend two: yeah, the same with me, I felt uncomfortable with some things that happened. \n\nHonestly most of the time when three people agree that a fourth one is in the wrong my first guess would be that the fourth is in the wrong but I've talked to everything that happened on the trip with a lot of people surround me that we have trust to be completely honest and they all agree that nothing that happened was that bad and that even I was in the right. \nI've went on longer and more stressing(camping with almost no money and no internet ) trips with friends and I've never had one issue, I go camping with the same 3 families for years and never had a disagreement, I've lived with a lot of people in small places and never had a fallout like this. \nI can take the blame that I could have handled some situations better but I still feel like this is vastly unfair. \nThe not talking to me until I realized was so immature and unnecessary I don't want to make an effort to fix things. I had a really good time hanging out once a week or so but a lot of times I got bored of how non negotiable was the fact that they never wanted to leave their confort zone with anything.\nI still have a hard time finding closure. I want to leave the situación amicably and be like alright! let's not hang out anymore.\nBut also I want to express that I feel like is unfair how unforgiving they were with me and also the \"I didn't like some of your actitudes\" is so vague?? Is it worth explaining my feelings or asking for a longer explanation or should I just leave it at that?",

        "text": "Hi, I have a bad time at communicating naturally on text or by email, (including social media/forums like reddit). I always put far too much thought into paragraphs or even just sentences and double/triple check to make sure it sounds 'normal' or 'friendly' enough or whatever the target audience expects. \n\nI don't do either often, but when the occasion happens, I can end up procrastinating pre- and post-sending the messages. I just find it so hard to come across naturally, I just want to stay true to myself, but is that not always the best way if you're clinically depressed? Like I can't fake happiness or express happiness for someone else unless I totally fake it, and then they'll see right through it anyway. Or the opposite end, if I'm writing a complaint about a product or a company, I find it hard to put my anger into the words, like if I want a refund for something, as a product arrived broken, but I feel very little emotion either way, and I find that this detracts from my ability to get the refund, if that makes sense?\n\nAlso, I can type/text quickly and don't mind not using text speak, but again, does that come across as unapproachable?\n\nI sometimes think I should just try and override my self-consciousness and reply with whatever comes first and avoid changing words etc. Another thing, I'm by no means a grammar expert or someone that knows loads of big clever words, but sometimes I might instinctively put in a word that I feel might come across as pretentious, especially if it's an informal messaging between someone else. Is it right to tone some words down to avoid this, and yet I think who cares why not, but again... these are social skills and perhaps putting whatever comes first isn't the best way.\n\nIt just feels like I can't have real communication with others, I'm scared of rejection or being viewed as not caring or boring, but then I avoid replying to people or wait several days until I feel I'm in the 'right' mood. Like if I'm feeling low, and I need to thank someone for something, I'll wait until I feel more genuinely happy, so I can put that across in words.\n\nI wasn't always like this, but 10 years of severe social anxiety takes its toll.",

I have this belief in my head that I’ve already ruined so many potential relationships/friendships and now it’s too late for me, I’ll never find people again to fill in those gaps, people to care about me and what I got going on. my shyness and depression led to all of this, things I’ve experienced in my past that traumatized me, obviously there’s more but just to sum it up. someone tell me that it’s not too late for me to start over, that I still have a chance to build my own family. I’m tired of feeling unloved, not enough, and like my past defines me. I wanna move on once and for all. I have terrible social skills, I always assume people are judging me before even having a conversation with them and that causes me to judge them and act weird towards them closing myself off even though they could’ve just been admiring me, I wanna learn how to stop projecting and open up to people and thinking everyone’s out to get me, I wanna learn how to hold a conversation and genuinely feel that connection. the lack of human interaction is killing me, someone please help…idk where to start.",

        "text": "I moved to a new country in a different continent to do study and I haven't been able to make friends. At all. I mean, there's a handful of people I very seldom hang out with, but I haven't found a proper group of people with whom I can share the experiences you live when living abroad. I'm saddened by this but not entirely shocked; I am very, very bad at making friends (hence me posting here). \n\nThe one exception is this one guy who lives in my same building, let's call him John. So John and I have done a lot of things together, like trying out new restaurants, cooking, movies, etc. He's really the only person I've ever made proper plans with. He's also a foreign student. \n\nJohn is christian, and he's part of this Christian group of people who gather every Sunday. They don't really preach with the Bible, they mostly have discussions about life and spirituality. He'd been pestering me to join them since like, October, but I only plucked up the courage to do so until last Friday. So I went. \n\nAnd it was absolutely lovely. I met a group of entirely lovely people and we engaged in an extremely fascinating discussion about a variety of topics. It was fantastic, and not to brag, but I got great feedback - everyone later told John that they loved me, they found me super clever, and that I was welcome to join them again whenever. I was beyond feeling excited. I'm not religious, at all, but these discussions were not about christian faith - they were about literature, culture, philosophy, feelings... I LOVE reading, and I was showing off all the books I've read, people were laughing with me, nodding, agreeing, embracing me. I felt at home.\n\nToday was their second weekly meeting. I had already said I'd go, but I stupidly did not take anyone's number last Friday. In my defense, no one really pulled out the phones during the meetings cause it's pretty rude/seen as a distraction. So I depended entirely on John for the details of today's meeting.\n\nJohn told me in the morning that today's meeting was at 4. He told me he'd text me his location later in the day so that I could drop by.  \n\nI went about my day and about at 2, I texted him asking him for the address. Nothing. 2:30 rolls by. Nothing. There's still time though, this is a tiny city, I could've left my place at 3:45 and made it on time. 3 comes. I text him again. Nothing, nada. I see he's online, but he's not answering me. 3:30. 3:50.  I've given up hope. I took off my make up, the outfit I had so meticulously planned, and go back to doing my assignments for next week. \n\n5 pm. John finally texts me. He sends me the address knowing well it's over an hour late. The discussions last maybe 1:30 mins tops. It was already too late. \n\nI was extremely excited for today and John knew that. But I didn't want to make a big spectacle of how sad I was feeling. So I calmly asked him why he hadn't texted me on time. He started sending me random emojis and random songs, telling me to listen to them (we exchange music a lot), and completely ignoring my messages. I finally text him like, please be serious, I'm honestly upset. He then finally says he \"forgot\" to text me because he was busy.  I know that's a lie, because he was online when I was texting him. He also *knew* how excited I was. He *knows* how hard it is for me to make friends whereas he's a social butterfly. And he's always hyping me up telling me I'm amazing, and I shouldn't be shy, and that I'm charming, and people like me and like spending time with me... Well, apparently not... \n\nAnyway, I don't know what to do. I don't know what I did. I thought things had gone great last meeting, but maybe people were just lying. Or maybe he was lying, I don't know. I feel so sad and miserable and dumb for getting my hopes up for this group of people. The way I see it, there's two options: a) Friday was a lie and people didn't actually like me, they all fake-laughed at my jokes, they all thought I was a disgusting, idiot loser with nothing interesting to say or b) John doesn't want me to keep on going to those meetings but doesn't have the guts to tell me. \n\nUltimately I want to know if I should:\n\n1. Accept John's half-assed apology about \"forgetting\" and pester him again for details of next meeting.\n2. Give up on this whole thing and not go to any more meetings every again. Maybe try to find my own group of friends somehow. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm sorry if I'm being hypersensitive, I know I am, but like... Listen, I'd never connected with anyone so quickly before. I *genuinely* thought these people liked me. I know a lot of you can understand how difficult it can be to bond with people, and I struggle like ***hell*** to do it. Friendships don't come easy to me. And for once, I thought that they did. But apparently my perception of reality was completely skewed...",

My patience for others has gone up tenfold because I understand that people who seem \"off\" are usually deeply damaged inside.\n\nThe problem is that my old tendencies of being distant towards others are still deeply ingrained.  \nIt affects my ability to form friendships with others (usually, casual friendships like ones at work). People automatically think I dislike them/aren't interested. My ability to be forthcoming with others is flawed.\n\nWhen im in a better place, I think I want to somehow help others who have felt the same way as me. The people who stood out to me the most were the ones who kept trying, even when i was distant. Every interaction where they went out of their way, even to just say \"how was your weekend\" was enough to not make me feel like an alien.\n\nHow do I learn to heal and become warm to others again?

I think generally that means I’m around a lot of young people of around 18-22 and as a result I think my somewhat out of touch mind struggles to keep up with their usually very quick witted and sometimes mean and snarky humor. \n\nLast time I was around people of this age was when I initially did undergrad back in 2015 or so and back then I didn’t usually experience the things I experience these days. I feel like everybody was much nicer and more accommodating. I was a bit weird but it was never a huge point of contention in my life. Things were manageable.\n\nThese days it feels like the smallest behavioral mishap can result in a snarky joke or a cruel snicker. I guess I should probably grow a thicker skin but to be honest it feels a bit dehumanizing and I get gradually worn away by the repetitive and predictable nature of these experiences. As of now it’s late at night and I keep reliving the memories of these experiences and I feel like it’s making me a bit bitter and overtly toxic in some ways because it makes me feel alienated from everyone around me. I don’t have that many friends so I guess I don’t have people to talk about this with other than the Reddit community. \n\nIf you have advice I’d be grateful.",

So you don't bother and it continues to stay with you.\n\nInstead, if we take small steps, talking to the cashier, that coworker about the weather, texting that friend again, the ball starts to get lighter. With enough practice it gets smaller and easier to move each time. Now you can go invite people, or accept invitations, or try something new.

I was indifferent to him until he sided with the bullies to call me names so I began disliking him as well. I guess he was sick of being picked on.\n\nIn high school there was this guy who was always sitting next to me. I thought it was a coincidence until my slow ass realized the ‘casual’ sitting order that was extracted monthly was hardly casual…they made fun of us and that we were a couple. We went along with the joke as it did not seem malicious in the freshman year but he had told me he did not like the class and there were douchebags (they were indeed).\n\nThe year after people started avoiding me and sending hints I was gay or a loser, not wanting to sit next to me and this guy was the only one who did not refuse and kinda treated me normally.\n\nI was skipping school due to anxiety and depression and school was hell for\nMe. I was also hated for that.\n\nRegardless, in my third year I dropped out and I remember he msged me saying we should talk and when I was confrontational (he never took my side even during bad moments and i was so jaded) he said i should fight back and begged me to come back at least one day so I could tell me how shitty they were and how they sucked etc but i just dropped out. I had to repeat one year as homeschooling did not work.\n\nI remember a couple of girls in specific made fun of us and teased that we were a couple, he even snapped and told her to stop. He was nice to him and I was to him but there was nothing romantic, we barely knew each other tbh\n\nThey were doing it in a mean way, like ‘how would you be with that thing’ sort of.\n\n\nEventually I finished HS and all…\n\nNow I am mostly average but get some attention and compliments but i am still insecure that I was somewhat repulsive?\n\nI doubt he had a crush on me tbh, he was one of the few people that was civil with me.\n\nWhat form of bullying is this?

We were just talking and he was like \"um yes I'll be gone for a moment\" left the talk and then came back 5 minutes later with this person and expected us to chat normally that was really uncomfortable because I don't want this person on this server. I do not want that. So after a while I left and then immediately kicked them off the server. And I just have to tell the whole thing to someone. Did I do the right thing? I'm so insecure What can I do to stop coming into contact with this person? I'm sorry to bother you with this. It's just like that person doesn't pay attention to the people around them, their emotions or opinions or anything at all. It's all just \"oh im so cool. what did you say? You disagree with me? NO! You're my friend you NEED to have the same opinion as I do\"  apart from that this person is like realllyyyy racist and says the N-word all the time and really sexual and I am like the complete opposite so its really uncomfortable cause I'm not interessted in sexual stuff at all.

        "text": "  hi all, I'm a 25 year old gay male who is also 400 pounds, who thanks to my own actions in life has knows nothing but the four walls of my bedroom in my mothers house for the last eight years or so. as you can imagine i don't work, or go anywhere, so i have plenty of time to just sit and think, and after several 3 a.m. crying sessions over the last years I've finally realized and accepted i was the problem.  \n\n  i think I'm severely emotionally stunted and to put a estimate on it, id say I'm 25 and act and think at most like an eleven year old starting middle school.  i do not meet society's expectations of social behavior for someone within my age range.  some problematic behaviors i exhibit are that i simply cant be disagreed with or criticized. whenever met with the slightest resistance or disagreement i feel attacked and will respond with name calling, yelling, cursing, or threatening people. if I'm online when this happens because people usually don't know what i look like i get mistaken for a child trolling quite often and people refuse to believe I'm a full grown adult acting like this. I can hold a grudge for an infinite amount of time over something as simple as someone looking at me wrong and may even want to get violent over it. I react disproportionally to situations and have a tendency to express emotions without restraint and become very unhinged. i have a hard time considering others feelings and wants its all about me and when i want something, i want it now and exactly how i pictured it in my head. \n\n  i have also been delayed in forming relationships or finding intimacy which really hurts me the most. i am a 25 year old virgin and never had 1 friend either. also due to all this other parts of my brain suffer due to functioning on a lower level. my sense of reasoning and cognitive ability are limited. i have a hard tie learning new things, feel dumb etc.\n\n  I'm considering therapy but i don't trust them anymore because my last ones were very mentally abusive towards me and called me names like dumb, the r word, and basically told me i would amount to nothing. i also question why i never matured or developed social skills in the first place like everyone else and think maybe this is permanent, which scares me. i also have been like this so long to the point where this behavior feels like a part of me on a deeper level and I'm attached to it  and feel as if its too late to try and change.",

I feel conflicted and a bit bad about this.\n\nA guy send me a friend request, and since I don't like to ignore people, I send him a message asking who he was and why did he add me. I'd like to know something about the person before accepting the friend request.\n\nUsually, if I add someone, is because minimum we had some exchange. For example, in a comment section from a group. Something they said was fun or interesting, so made me want to know them more. And usually, I say something about it: if not in the comments \"hey, can I add you?\" later, I send a message like \"hey, I'm from x groups\" or \"I saw you like x and I think that's cool, I love it too\"\n\nSo I feel a bit confused when someone does it out of the blue without saying anything at all like, why did you add me?  \nAnd I want to give people a chance bc, maybe they are interesting, maybe we like each other, maybe there's something there.\n\nOk so, I started talking to him and he asked questions. I know that is a way that people use to get to know someone like \"Where are you from? What do you do for a living? What music do you like? do you have siblings?\". But I don't like to talk to someone when the conversation looks like a questionnaire, I feel it draining. It makes me have to think of an answer and I don't always have the energy for that.  \nI much rather when there's a topic that I can join, or when the other person tells me stuff and I can comment.   \nMaybe it's s something personal, but I feel like when people only ask you questions like \"How are you? what's new?\" etc is kinda lazy, like... I have to entertain them.\n\nSo I stopped replying to him and felt guilty.   \nYesterday I did send him a message saying that I'm not really looking for new virtual friendships because they took too much energy for me. But I apologize if I was being inconsiderate\n\nDo you think that is mean to delete someone's friend request or not responding messages if you really don't feel like talking to them? IDK maybe is someone who doesn't know how to make friends and is trying their best. Or sometimes a guy just adds a bunch of random girls to see what he can get.\n\nSomething like this happens to me in person too, sometimes people ask me questions when I don't want to talk about myself or I'm tired and people say that is unpolite to not reply, so what can I do then?  \nI have the impulse to withdraw myself and it is difficult for me to verbalize what is happening at the time, and I feel like I'm being mean or inconsiderate to others.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Even the more social people are like not very animated. Everyone seems somewhat awkward (I’m a little awkward too but in a different way). Obviously not everyone fits this archetype but it’s common for people here to just be more standoffish and academically focused (I care about my academics but I’m most definitely not gonna talk about school at a party)\n\nI’ve been getting the vibe that people generally feel uncomfortable with me here. I can just kinda see it in their faces. Like I’m this high energy alien creature. \n\nIt’s just weird because I’ve never struggled so much socially until now. I literally did an internship last year and my social life was glowing and I had great friends. Now , nothing. Like I don’t even get invited to things anymore .\n\nShould I change to fit the culture more ? I’ve been joining clubs and I’m noticing similar results.

        "text": "I'm 20F and I'm cripplingly introverted and socially awkward. Taking up many suggestions and advice from the people around me I've been trying to get out of my comfort zone recently and socialize with people. I attended a two day hackathon through my uni. I knew 0 people there and struggled a lott to not just stay in a corner by myself. Every other person seemed to have someone they already knew and although it felt like I was very hard at work putting my maximum possible effort and energy into socializing I had not much to show for it at the end of the day. \n\nThe process was extremely nerve wracking and it left me with even lesser self confidence than I had in the first place. I broke down completely at the end of the first day curled into a ball and slept for like 12 hours straight. I do have a lot of technical skills and potential (at least I think I do) but I wasn't able to perform at all due to my social anxiety. \n\nI had some random teammates I was assigned and we did manage to pull it together and get away with it the second day. But I definitely couldn't give it my all. I wasn't able to think clearly, my head was a blur, I couldn't speak coherently, I was always at a loss for words. I knew I lack people skills but I never realised I was this suuucccckyyyy. I'm really desperate to get out of this and get better. \n\nThere were a lot of mentors and great ppl really pushing us and motivating us. I almost didn't want to go back the next day but I convinced myself I would regret it if I didn't. Now that I did go, I'm not sure how it actually helped me with my anxiety. Of course I would have never known what I am capable of and not but just putting myself out there without any preparation about how I should navigate through things and handle people at all was really vexing and my self confidence has definitely taken a huge hit. The whole day I answered my mentor's questions with just a yes or a no and never touched the mic once. Of course getting on stage is a goal that's far far out of reach right now. \n\nSo what can I do to better equip myself in life situations? I've been in a shell all my life and I'm coming out only now. I have a lot to learn. Do I read books? Should I look up YouTube videos? Do you have any suggestions for me?",

But we get on well, although it’s a little awkward on shift between us sometimes but we normally smoke a joint after work if we finish at the same time so I figure she doesn’t hate me at least lol. \n\nBasically I’m autistic and was a late bloomer socially so I’m still learning all this and I’m especially not too experienced with girls, only time I ever have done anything with girls are on nights out when I’ve been wasted. \n\nSo as I said I kinda like this girl but I’m not really sure if I’m looking into things too much but even if it doesn’t work out with her I still want to learn about this sorta stuff, especially the eye contact. Growing up I was fat and bullied and shy as fuck so up until like a year ago I couldn’t even hold eye contact with anyone never mind understanding it. \n\nI’ve noticed with her she can be kinda forward with it sometimes like if we’re talking sometimes she’ll fully hold it, other times she take quick glances away then look back. I’ve also noticed once or twice that I’ll turn around and notice she’s looking at me and she won’t break the eye contact or some times as I’m walking towards her she will just look at me, but there’s also times if we’re walking past each other she won’t even look at me just like looking off to somewhere else. \n\nAlso what does it mean when someone looks at you with like a side eye, for example when we smoke we normally sit on a wall together side by side and when I talk she won’t turn to look at me but she look out the corner of her eyes at me, we actually had a massive joke about it where she was messing with me that she had like 200* peripheral and I was so high I believed her lmao but that’s irrelevant. \n\nSorry if this all sounds fucking stupid but like I said it’s all new to me and I’d really appreciate any help from someone who isn’t a social fuck up lol",

Obviously, in reality, I'm an introvert, so it's simply about acquiring assets, and it might also make sense to come up with stuff that would justify such behavior: \"I'm gregarious because I've always enjoyed assisting others (some fake backstory).\" VS \"I'm gregarious because you could benefit me.\"\n\nAnother benefit of this would be further improving my theory of mind (I'm young so trying to max out my neuroplasticity potential), and the fact that I have few avenues for relating to people (e.g., my past was tragic and ppl don't like to hear about unpleasant stuff)",

But got called a liar because I couldn't give any proof of declining some invitations (because I was travelling). Lost friends on both situation of otherwise a tight-knit community. Damned if I do, damned if I don't 😰\n\nNext week I will go on a trip of a lifetime to US for more than a month, how often should I post about my vacation? Is 5 ig posts, 10 fb pics a story every 3-4 days too much?",

        "text": "CW suicide (not attempted, just threats), bullying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR for 6 years of school, I had two incessant bullies who spent their entire time isolating me from anyone else in my class, spreading rumours about me despite the fact that I never once spoke to them, telling me to kms, insulting my face, body, etc. and my behaviour (for context, I've got ADD and ASD - probably didn't help)\n\nWhile I feel like I've made improvements with my confidence since (it's been a year and a half since school ended and I got away from them), I still can't stand photos of myself. I've tried to put myself out of my comfort zone and add some people from work on Snapchat, but the few times I've sent photos with my face on them, people have saved them in the chat, or set them as profile pics on other social media, etc.\n\nThe few decent ones have respected my wishes when I've asked them to change it. They don't know my trauma, but the least I can expect them to do is change it if I ask.\n\nHowever, a couple have revealed themselves to kinda be complete dicks, and refuse to change pfp even if I ask repeatedly, over and over again. I feel like the only way I'd be able to get them to change it would be if I told them my trauma, the therapy I've had to undergo, etc. but these are clearly not the type of people I want knowing that. Yet, it's also not something I can complain about to work because they're doing it on non-work social medias. \n\nAt this point, what do I do? I want to work on coming out of my comfort zone and being able to \"fit in\" a bit better, but when I try to - it must seem so \"out of the ordinary\" for them that they need to do shit like this as a result. I know ultimately my face being on their profile doesn't actually mean much and no one likely cares a huge amount - but Jesus, it hurts for me and I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "Long story short, I’m going through a bit of a rough time right now. Lost my job and all sorts of things have just been going wrong since. My mental health has taken a serious decline in this time. I have had friends send me well wishes and check in on me, but what I really needed/wanted was quality time with them and I’ve just been feeling really sad and lonely recently because I feel like no one has really reached out to spend time with me. I understand everyone has their own stuff going on and are busy so I’m trying not to take it to heart, but I can’t help feeling a little hurt. \n\nI also recognise that I never communicated that that’s what I need from them so I understand that it’s  unreasonable for me to feel this way. The one person I did tell that I really needed plans to feel better ended up cancelling last minute before we were supposed to hang out and I just feel sad because I was looking forward to this. I almost want to say that to her but I don’t know what the point of that would be, really. \n\nI have been struggling to initiate plans because of my mental health but since no one is coming to me I want to go to them. \n\nI have a hard time speaking up for myself and communicating my needs because of how I grew up. I tend to just act like I’m fine and deal with things on my own. In the future, how can I express that what I need is time with friends? And how can I stop feeling hurt when I never told anyone that this is what I need?",

        "text": "I'm in my early 20s and probably just about have a handful of friends. This isn't a problem in itself as I've always been happy with a small group of friends, but I don't really make new ones (or know how to) so my concern is about what may happen when friends drift further away as many tend to do as we all get older. \n\nI think I'm a pretty normal person, definitely more introverted than extroverted but not to any kind of extreme extent (e.g. I enjoy going clubbing and have been into all of that since way too young). I don't have trouble being social at work and my job relies to an extent on having social skills as I'm regularly talking to and meeting new people professionally. I've also almost always had girlfriends so I'm fairly sure I don't have any kind of massive red flags that would cause people to want to avoid me. \n\nI'm beginning to think at least some of my future friends will be people I meet at work especially due to the amount of time spent at work in this industry. As I said, I get on with colleagues quite well, some I'm closer with than others, but I have no idea where the line is drawn between people being friendly in a polite professional way and where there is the opportunity for genuine friendships to be formed. Even if I did know where this line was, I would have no idea how to go about 1) instigating this friendship 2) transferring this relationship to outside of work and 3) maintaining it should one or both of us move on to another company. \n\nAny advice?",

All this left me with 1 close  friend and barely any acquaintances till 1st year of college. \n\nWhenever i tried to talk to someone  my mind would just go blank and i wouldn't know what to talk. My life isn't really that interesting so i don't have many experiences to share with them either . I wanted to improve my social skills So i've been taking inputs , reading posts and comments from this and some other subreddits from past few months and tried applying them. \n\n I got mixed results , was successful in making quite a few friends (6-7) in my batch  some of them were my classmates in high school but i had never interacted much with them , others were strangers. That aside i made many acquaintances from my batch as well as our batches in the college too . I got to  hangout with so many friends for the first time and had lots of fun , began getting invited too by some people which made me super happy. Well there were times when i  Got ignored , ghosted by some others also  i failed terribly in interacting with some people making it awkward for both of us but i guess that's a part of the process i'm just glad i broke out of my shell and put effort into this. \n\nI'm still not very good at socializing but it is atleast   much better than before.I still feel socializing is pretty exhausting since i have to keep a lot of things in mind , not to mention there aren't many people around me who have common interests with me  . I'm not kidding , since school it has been a problem since i generally don't like stuff that's popular among people around me and they aren't interested in stuff i like . Eg: Cricket and Football is very very popular here but i'm interested in badminton which barely anyone wants to play. I tried putting effort to learn their favourite sport, music etc so that i can keep up with conversations but i wasn't liking it because nobody was doing the same for me ,  so i stopped doing it .\n\nJust wanted to thank people  who helped me and i'm glad i found this subreddit.",

I was indifferent to him until he sided with the bullies to call me names so I began disliking him as well. I guess he was sick of being picked on.\n\nIn high school there was this guy who was always sitting next to me. I thought it was a coincidence until my slow ass realized the ‘casual’ sitting order that was extracted monthly was hardly casual…they made fun of us and that we were a couple. We went along with the joke as it did not seem malicious in the freshman year but he had told me he did not like the class and there were douchebags (they were indeed).\n\nThe year after people started avoiding me and sending hints I was gay or a loser, not wanting to sit next to me and this guy was the only one who did not refuse and kinda treated me normally.\n\nI was skipping school due to anxiety and depression and school was hell for\nMe. I was also hated for that.\n\nRegardless, in my third year I dropped out and I remember he msged me saying we should talk and when I was confrontational (he never took my side even during bad moments and i was so jaded) he said i should fight back and begged me to come back at least one day so I could tell me how shitty they were and how they sucked etc but i just dropped out. I had to repeat one year as homeschooling did not work.\n\nI remember a couple of girls in specific made fun of us and teased that we were a couple, he even snapped and told her to stop. He was nice to him and I was to him but there was nothing romantic, we barely knew each other tbh\n\nThey were doing it in a mean way, like ‘how would you be with that thing’ sort of.\n\n\nEventually I finished HS and all…\n\nNow I am mostly average but get some attention and compliments but i am still insecure that I was somewhat repulsive?\n\nI doubt he had a crush on me tbh, he was one of the few people that was civil with me.\n\nWhat form of bullying is this? It’s so humiliating",
