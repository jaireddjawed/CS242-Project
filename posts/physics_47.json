Making the assumptions that the Sun doesn't move, and that all the orbits are perfect elipsies. \n\nI had this question the other day, and have been thinking about it, but since the moon and year cycles aren't completely linked, that means that even if the earth returns to the same location in orbit, the moon doesn't, or does it anyways because of some harmonic aspect of orbits?\n\nA simpler way of asking the question may be, if we had a lunar eclipse, when would the next lunar eclipse occur during the same day of the year?",

        "text": "Right. When I was little, Carl Sagan told me that if I traveled at the speed of light, time would pass more slowly for me then it would the people I left behind. Several other TV physicists have reiterated that, so it must be true. I accept it. But I sure as hell don't understand it. So maybe someone can explain something to me?\n\nLet's say that I'm going to travel at the speed of light to the nearby star of Doohickey.  Doohickey is exactly one light your way. And we will throw out any unnecessary concerns, such as inertia food and such. So I set out towards doohickey. I'm traveling at the speed of light and I'm traveling a distance of one light year. So it takes me a year to get there. And a year to get back.  Two years total, right? But for who?\n\nWhen I get back, my wife is a crone.  Time has passed faster for her than it did for me. Or is that incorrect?\n\nIn other words, is it two years from the perspective of the people that are left on Earth? Did they see me travel outward for one year and then travel back for one year?\n\nOr is it two years of travel time for me, the actual traveler? And if so, how long was I gone from the perspective of the people I left behind? It seems that one or both of us are not actually traveling at the perceived speed of light?\n\nI see two scenarios. The first is that I traveled for a year out. Bought something in the Doohickey gift shop.  Them traveled back for another year. Two years total from my perspective. But if that was 80 years from my wife's perspective. That I must not have been traveling at the speed of light from her perspective.\n\nScenario 2 is that I did travel at the speed of light from her perspective, made the round trip in 2 years, but then when I get back barely anytime has passed. And if so, then it must seem to me like I traveled well in excess of the speed of light.\n\nSo which is it? Or is my question flawed and there's some sort of \"relative\" answer? :-)",

I understand the relativity of simultaneity and how things which appear to happen ‚Äúat the same time‚Äù in one frame of reference may not appear so in another.  Where this becomes paradoxical is when I think about what happens to something that is moving at the speed of light. \n\nFor a photon, it would seem that it‚Äôs entire existence is compressed down to a single point and all events happen ‚Äúsimultaneously‚Äù from its frame of reference or perspective, is this correct? If so, the paradox here would be that from our perspective a photon comes into existence at t=x then ceases to exist at t=y, yet things continue to happen long past t=y‚Ä¶ Things which, according to the photon, occurred simultaneous to things that occurred during the photons existence‚Ä¶ this seems impossible.  How can things which happen *after* a photons existence appear to happen simultaneously with things which occur *during* the photons existence (from the photons perspective)? \n\nWhere have I gone wrong?
