        "text": "When I was a teenager but not old enough to drive, (13-15 maybe), my stepmom decided that we couldn't keep dog that we had. She didn't take it to a shelter and I don't remember why. Maybe she said \"They're all kill shelters around here.\" We all got in our van. It was in the middle of the night. She made me and my stepsister accompany her. I did NOT live in a household where I could refuse ANY commands from my parents. It didn't feel right to me at all. She took us and the dog to an affluent neighborhood nearby and said \"someone around here is bound to take him in.\" I do not remember if I was the person who opened the trunk. I do not remember if the dog jumped out or if one of us took it out, and I will never let myself remember. It wasn't cold that time of year. We drove off. I never knew what happened to that dog. I would have never EVER done that if it were up to me. I feel like a monster. I frequently consider ending my life because of regret. I have saved several dogs in my life and none of it makes up for that. I will never forgive myself or my stepmother for that. I am a terrible person and the only reason I don't kill myself is because my biological mom needs my help because she is disabled.",

I vividly remember taking the neatly folded toilet paper my mom was handing me, wiping, then throwing the shit covered paper around like those dancers do with string. \n\nIt got worse when I got older. When I was 6, up until I was about 15, I would quite literally paint the walls in piss behind the toilet. Would try to make the shapes of animals with the splatters on the wall. Usually it was a lot of camels with too many humps and too many legs. \n\nOne day I turned on a sink and ran the water for 4 hours straight. Running it over my hands, putting whole rolls of toilet paper into it, stuffing the drain, etc. Did that on multiple occasions, ended up doing it with the bathtub too. Would literally sit in the bathtub with the water running right into the drain, but I would cup my hands under it and just dump water EVERYWHERE. Of course, as it gets under old tiles, they start to come up. I have a vivid memory of like 11 year old me RIPPING EVERY TILE up out of my bathroom floor. Right down to the sub floor. I guess it was the sub floor, whatever it was. I was really stressed out about it while I was doing it too so I ended up pooping over a bit of it. \n\nI would fill shampoo bottles up with water/piss/whatever. That was the biggest ordeal, because it could have even been a brand new bottle of shampoo or conditioner, completely ruined in like 5 minutes. \n\nOne day I got really obsessive about it and started collecting the water, filling all the bottles I could find (pretty much anything that could hold water in the house that I could move.) My poor mother got off a 10 hour shift, came home and even stopped for McDonald's for me, only to see that I had like 5 hours of work out into filling containers and putting them in my (CARPETTED) room. Most of the containers buster/broke and completely drained into the carpet.",

I didn't hesitate and smoked. It was fun while it lasted but once the high ended I sunk into a very deep depression, so I smoked more. It was intense. I eventually moved on to harder drugs as the high wasn't as strong as the first time. By the time I realized I was doing damage to myself I had overdosed. It was during a red rocks amphitheater concert. In the middle, I felt light headed, but a different kind of light headed. The type that'll kill you. When I woke up I was in the hospital, my mom was next to me and asked why I had lived like no one loved me. It pissed me off, because it was true. No one loved me because it was never shown to me if they had. When I got outta the tub (they put me in a tub with water) I left and explored. Found some place that had a lot of glass. A small business looking place, but capable of fixing damage and I vandalized it. \n\nNo glass survived my assault. Nor did the clothing behind the glass. I didn't realize how significant the clothes was still I read one of the signs. But I didn't mind. \n\nI'm no longer in debt though. All physical damages paid for. Except for the other kind. No idea why I thought they would've paid for damages they didn't cause.",

It was just beginning so no it wasn't weird that he didn't put anything about it on SM.\nSo we begin a relationship and end up sleeping together. \nI go back home to visit family when he tells me he actually is about to propose to another woman. \nI was pissed and hurt that someone I had been friends with FOR YEARS would do that to me. \nSo I tell him it's okay we can still have a sexual relationship as long as he wants and I'll keep quiet. \nSo when I got back to the city, he was on his way over and I set up my laptop camera. \nI recorded our sexual encounter as disgusted as I was to have him touching me.\nHe didn't believe me when I told him so I sent him a screen shot.\nDid I ever do anything with it? Nope.\nBut I could. \nBut every now and then I send him that picture to allow me to live rent free in his head.",

        "text": "I(29M) met her(27f) when we were little kids (7 and 5). she was that annoying little girl that always wanted to tag along with her brother to every game we played, even though she sucked at it. When she turned 10, she started having a crush on me.\n\nIt was a huge thing. Our parents were thrilled. Me, on the other hand, not so much. I was a shy 12 yr old and was embarrassed she went around declaring her love for me. Everyone in our little town knew about it. People would tease me constantly, and I would try to scare her off, but she didn't budge. When I turned 18, I finally realized my feelings for her. I wanted to be with her, and I wanted to be the person she woke up to every morning and the last person she saw every night before she slept.\n\nWe started dating. We were in love. I was the happiest man in the world. Until she graduated high school. We are from a small country in Southeast Asia, and my girl wanted to move to the UK for her studies. I didn't stop even though I wanted her to stay with me. I had no money and didn't want to stop her from chasing her dreams. She's the most intelligent person I know, and I wanted her to pursue her dreams. So I let her go. We tried LDR for one year, but the time diff complicated it, and we eventually broke up.\n\nI wasn't interested in anyone else after her. I stayed single and celibate because I couldn't imagine being with another woman. Three years ago, she moved back after completing her studies, and holy fuck, she was and still is so beautiful. I remember not being able even to utter any word. I was afraid she had met somebody else there. But no, she cried when she saw me, and we hugged. I missed her scent; I missed her.\n\nOne year ago I proposed to her and five months ago we got married. And I still love her, my beautiful Riya &lt;3",

        "text": "I checked my Facebook for the first time in months. One of my college dorm friends had become FB friends with another guy on our floor. That guy's roommate was a complete fucking prick who did just about anything he could to make my freshman year a hellscape whenever I was in my room or on my floor. Classic bully bullshit.  Shove me, steal or fuck with my stuff, say all kinds of rude shit about me to any girls I brought back.  One day he came in to talk to my roommate and just started ripping my stuff off my wall for no reason other than to get a rise out of me. I told him if he ripped off one more thing I was coming at him. Now this guy probably had two or three inches and 30 lb on me but he defiantly ripped down a poster and stared me down as he did it, letting it float to the floor. I jumped up and flew at him in a rage, got in a very lucky punch to his left eye that knocked him down and proceeded to lose my shit as a bunch of guys in our hallway pulled me off of him. I will totally admit that it was a lucky shot and that if he had actually gotten on top of me I think I would have been in a lot of trouble. I gave him a really nice black eye. For the few remaining weeks of the semester dorm people just made fun of him about it and tried to egg him on for revenge / another fight but he left me alone and then moved off campus the following semester and I never saw him again\n\nAnyway, I knew his hometown and he had an unusual last name so I grabbed a sheet of paper, wrote down all of the things that I knew it would hurt him to read. Fat, hairy, fucked up teeth, couldn't get laid in a whorehouse with a suitcase full of cash, personality based on nothing other than being an asshole. Real eighth grade kind of stuff. Tucked it into a birthday card I had laying around, found his address online, verified with the County tax records that he was the owner of that property, and mailed it to him. Our little fisticuffs was 30 years ago. With the way he acted I can't imagine that he didn't spend a lifetime collecting enemies and would have no reason to believe that letter came from me. I wore gloves and used tongs and tweezers. I don't have a criminal record but people getting pinched decades later because of 23andMe profiles of their brother who knows. I didn't threaten him, just said insulting things. Anyway, I hope he gets it on Friday and it fucks up his weekend thinking about it.",

        "text": "My life is dreadful, dull, boring, and shit because I caused it. Am I here to gather sympathy and forgiveness? Maybe but the truth is I don't know what a confession like this will gain. Maybe I was just an underage teenager who made stupid decisions.\n\nAt 12-14... I had a friend who loved me to death and guess what I did. I fucking tormented him and probably put him through therapy. I created a phrase that run around everywhere even though I didn't distribute it.\nMy only friend who stuck by me... I tormented.\nI made him cry countless times and looking back at nearly soon to be 19 years old.. I can't live with myself. I honestly believe I lacked something genetically... maybe empathy and compassion? I really don't know. You wouldn't understand how ai treated him. It was horrible and I honestly wonder if im a visual reminder of his painful undeserving memories.\n\nGuess what though? Karma is a fucking bitch. I got things handed to me worse and I was hated amongst everyone. Everyone seemed to be ignoring me and I fucking deserved it. I'm honestly glad I got justice knowing the agony I caused people. People spread truth and non truthful rumors around me and I'm glad I got a taste of my own medicine. No one wants to be hated, but I now understand how much I deserve it. Maybe all this toxicity stems from childhood verbal abuse? It was horrible because God I wonder the trauma at such an age that I've created for those who stuck around me. \n\n\nAt nearly 15 years old I developed \"empathy\". When I did I wondered why I never was like this to begin with? Did I develop this beautiful sadness due to development or trials? I don't know but I believe my empathy that was non existential is a gifted curse. I fell into severe depression following this. I wish I was normal and not underdeveloped during puberty. When I was young at 14... I can't believe how much of a sexist, misogynist, racist, homophobe I was. I'm glad I changed. My developed personna and empathy due to bittersweet depression changed my life.\n\nAt nearly 19 years right now, I'm apologising to those I've heart and my dpdr is slowly getting better. At this moment as I speak apologising to them all. Redemption is beautiful. Thank you red dead Redemption.",

So we have the feel and operational skills of a small business but the support and pay of a big business. No one knew how to use excel.\n\nMy job is simple data entry. It used to take more than a week to do a weeks worth od data entry. So there was a growing backlog, hence why i was hired. I took over all of it. I am young and i didn't graduate college (for many reasons) so i was just happy to be employed. I would work late every week to meet my deadlines. I refused to complain or tell people i couldn't handle my job responsibilities because i needed the job and i needed to be seen as capable. I refused extra responsibilities with the very real explanation that i wouldn't be able to handle them. \n\nAs time went on, I would spend time googling excel fixes to problems i was facing. Over time I made my work load easier. At first i was just working my 40 hours and doing no over time. Then i had abiut 3 free hours every Friday to catch up on emails and organize my files. Then i had almost every Friday free. I used that time to improve my excel skills and make a brand new data tracking excel sheet that was implemented in the new year. There were a bunch of minor fires that my branch needed to put out so i had a backlog of data entry again in the new year. I just got caught up 3 weeks ago. \n\nNow that i am using my new sheet. My job can be done in 2 days if nothing goes wrong. 3 days is more accurate though. I just haven't told anyone. I make sure to offer help to my coworker but its never enough to fill 2 days. My job is remote so i work from home. I thought about telling my manager abo the new system i implemented but id just get more responsibilities pushed on me. My coworker is amazing. She is more competent as our manager than our manager. She keeps getting more work piled on her and no raises. Our manager is trying to make her do stuff she isn't qualified or paid for. I don't want that for me. There is no room for upward movement in our company unless we move. I highly doubt that i would ever be paid enough to move. Not only that i don't want to work here forever. I like many things about my job, but my actual job is not one of them. I feel guilty for staying quiet but i don't see actual benefits to saying anything. No one but me knows how to write any type of excel formula. So i am necessary to maintain the documents i created. No one else would be able to do it.",

        "text": "It happened at around 7pm. I was heading home from work, it was really dark, and it was raining to the point where visibility was hard. I was driving on a long 45mph limit street along with other cars around me. When I tried to lane change, I accidentally side tapped another car (total of 2 taps) but instead of pulling over, I freaked out and sped and took a different direction home. When I got home, I checked my car but there was no visible damage anywhere. No scratches or bumps. Still, I freaked out because the guy (or girl?) I hit may have a dash cam or witnesses (cars behind us) might’ve had one. My family and I have been struggling financially and Im freaking out. I told myself I would never flee the scene again after. Forgive me redditors for a scumbag like me driving on the streets.. I wish I could go back in time fix my mistake of fleeing.\n\nAgain it was dark out with nothing but street lights and it was pouring. This happened in California. Any advice on what I should do next? Im assuming the person I hit had no damages either since I didnt have any but who knows…",

I personally think that racial segregation wouldn't be that bad if spaces were truly separate but equal \n\nThe main problem with segregation is that the spaces made for minorities were usually inferior to those made for whites. In Apartheid South Africa, elementary and high schools made for blacks were far inferior to white schools and only existed to train black people how to do cheap manual labor, and blacks were banned from attending universities. In the US, black spaces were almost always inferior to white spaces. If you could ensure that white and black spaces were genuinely completely equal, I would have no problem with segregation.",
