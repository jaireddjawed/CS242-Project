        "text": "At the moment I'm on an outbound campaign. Prospective customers will submit their details on our website, we call them back and try to sign them up. Easy. Of course there are quite a few existing customers who also submit their information, probably thinking they'll get through to us faster then calling directly (and depending on what time of day they're calling they're right.) I usually follow up on these calls on the off chance they're moving or want to add an additional property but 8/10 just a customer service inquiry that I have to transfer anyway. \n\nYesterday I call an older bloke (born in the 1940's) who just wanted to confirm he was on the best plan and advise us he got a new concession card (which we already knew because it automatically updates.) Obviously I tell him before I can discuss his account he'll need to confirm his full name, d.o.b and address. His response? \"Oh I can't be bothered going through all of that.\" Um, ok. Then I can't discuss the account. I suggested he call back if he's still needing to discuss the account. He asks another account specific question and I reiterate that I can't discuss his account unless he confirms his details. \"But you already have all that information!\" \"Yes, I do, and I need you to confirm them so I can verify I'm speaking to the right person before continuing.\" He eventually yeilds, I transfer him to customer service and get on with my day, but he spent more time complaining about the process than it would have taken to just verify his identity.",

An hour later I get a call from someone complaining that there is no reception is his store, and he had reception the previous day. I followed the script, found out his store is close to the burnt tower and told him that the tower near him was damaged and we were sending teams to work on it. His response was \"I know it was damaged, I burnt it\". I was a but shocked, but managed to collect myself and thank him for his call, and that I will forward the information to the police.   \nI did notify my managers, and they did notify the police, but I have no Idea if anything happened to him. The tower was rebuilt a couple of times, and then moved to a different spot.",

        "text": "Yet another old timer story, but I saw a comment on another post and it reminded me of this. Not about a particular call, but a trainee. Hopefully this is ok to post here.\n\nWay back in the early 2000s, I worked for a cell phone company in the US and was doing welcome calls for new customers. On these calls we'd go over what the customer's current rate plan was, as well as how much of it they'd used so far. This was still early enough in the days of cell phones that people hadn't had them before, you actually paid for a number of minutes you'd planned to use each month, texting had just become popular, and we still had plans that you could get charged extra for roaming while traveling within the US. Combine this with the first month's bill always being prorated and it's a recipe for a really high first invoice with a panicked/pissed off customer that would either pay the fee to break their contract or just stop paying the bill altogether and let it roll to collections (costing the company even more money).\n\nI was pretty good at these welcome calls. Good enough that, somehow, when new hire classes would come out to the floor to job shadow, the trainees would actually ask to be placed with me by my name.\n\nThe trainees we were getting were all temp-to-hire, so they'd be a contractor for a few months to be trained and then work on a \"nesting\" team for a bit before the company decided to hire as a permanent employee. This made it a bit easier since we were bringing on a lot of new people, because if it wasn't working out for whatever reason, it was less paperwork for the company to cut the contract for a person. \n\nFor the most part, the trainees that would sit with me were alright. It was a lot of information to digest within the first few weeks of starting a job, but we had a handy flow chart document (that actually was accurate and helpful!) and the systems really weren't too difficult to work with compared to some others I'd had to use. It was also comparatively low-stress, because it wasn't an automated outbound dial; there was a queue in the system that would bring up accounts, we (technically) had all the time we wanted to review the account, calculate the customer's usage and what rate plan they should be changed to (if appropriate), and then you manually dialed out to the customer with all that information in hand. Basically each account and call was like a fun math word problem and then you got to help someone not have a high bill, so usually calls ended with a happy customer. And like I said, most of the trainees caught on, but it was a lot and some didn't, which is ok and to be expected.\n\nHowever, some trainees were there just to collect a paycheck for as long as they could (I presume so they had an easy path to unemployment after they flunked out of training), and others just shouldn't have even been sent to us due to lack of qualification. One person sticks out, a (probably) middle-aged woman, I can't remember if she'd told me about her previous job(s) or work experience because red flags starting flying up within moments of her sitting down. \n\nAfter we introduce ourselves to each other, and I bring up the first account and show her how I organize my windows (because the system would default to stack them all instead of putting them side by side on the screen so you could see everything), step through the account (luckily, the first one was super straightforward , the math could be done in our heads...well, mine anyway) and then it's time to call the customer, so I ask her to plug in her headset.\n\nTrainee: \"Oh that's ok, I can just listen to you and watch.\"\n\nMe (and I can only imagine the look of \"are you f-ing kidding me\" on my face as I realize that she doesn't even have her headset with her): \"N-No, you need to go get your headset.\"\n\nThankfully she didn't argue, and without complaint went to the training room and came back with her headset. She plugged it in, I dialed out, talked to the customer, took care of things, hang up, and start to break down why I did the things that I did on the call. We move on to the next account and work through it similarly. She's not really asking any questions and we've all been told that at this point in the training they really just need to get a feel for how things are paced and what real-life calls are like, so I'm not expecting a ton out of her. But it wasn't until we got a really complicated account, multiple lines with a shared minute plan, had to use the special spreadsheet tool to break everything down, that things started to really break down.\n\nI'm showing her where I'm copying and pasting data between windows to calculate the current usage across all the lines, flipping between screens using alt-tab (which I had to tell her about) and pointing to different things as I'm stepping through how I'm working the account and making the calculations work.\n\nTrainee: \"Wait, where did you get that?\"\n\nMe: \"Oh\" (moves mouse pointer and waves it in a circle around the data in a window on the side of the screen) \"right here. So you take this and...\"\n\nTrainee: \"I didn't see that, can you go back?\"\n\nMe: \"Uh, right here.\" (brings window to the front, waves mouse in larger concentric circles around the data) \"So from here you...\"\n\nTrainee: \"No wait, I still can't see how you're getting that.\"\n\nMe: \"It's...\" (completely confused I turn to look at her because literally it's a number that I'm matching up between two different windows that are fully visible on the screen and discover that she's not looking at the screen \\*she's looking at my hand on the mouse\\* so I lift my hand from the mouse and point at the monitor with my index finger and watch her eyes follow) \"right here.\"\n\nTrainee: \"Oh I see.\"\n\nI start to go on, struggling to hide my disturbance, and she mentions...\n\nTrainee: \"Before today I didn't know you could move those.\"\n\nMe: \"Move...what?\"\n\nTrainee: \"Those.\"\n\nMe (thinks back through everything I'd just done): \"The...windows?\"\n\nTrainee: \"Yeah, those boxes.\"\n\n😳\n\nI couldn't tell if she genuinely hadn't ever used a computer before, or if the placement agency had told her that we'd provide her with ALL training, or if she was just playing dumb until she got booted... but I stayed late to go to my supervisor and tell her that she needed to be cut because she didn't know how to use a computer.\n\nMe: \"Supervisor, I know you're going to think this is ridiculous, but you have to have Trainee cut.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"Oh AvgHeight510, you're overreacting.\"\n\nMe: \"No Supervisor, she does \\*not\\* know how to use a computer.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"Just because she's not at your level...\"\n\nMe: \"No no no, seriously, she's never used a computer before, she was watching my hand work the mouse instead of the screen to see what I was actually doing!\"\n\nSupervisor: (shaking her head) \"You have to learn to give people a chance.\"\n\nMaybe my supervisor was right, but at the time, I knew from having to try and teach my mom how to use a computer that she wouldn't be able to pick this up before the end of training. With management so on top of us to find ways to reduce costs wherever possible (if I remember right, the office supply cabinet would only be opened once a month, and we were allowed to have only one of any particular item we asked for - one pen, one pencil, one notepad, one thing of post-its...literally if you needed two different colors of something you had to ask for it the following month), we continued to pay this person and eat up our time that we could have spent working through accounts more quickly (and therefore saving the company more money) when it was clear she would not pass training. \n\nAnd I was right, she had to be cut before the end of training because she wasn't able to work on her own. Thankfully they didn't place her with me for job shadowing again.",

Luckily I found Tech Support for a US based Telecommunications company here in Mexico. \n\nTech Support is quite a nice job. People call you, so you don’t have to go around annoying people, they request you. I see the queue as cases that need a resolution. I know 60% of the calls are regular broken lines and stuff. But 30% require a fine tuned job that took me around a year to master. And 10% is just fun. \n\nYou do get the occasional sob story, angry customer, and racist people (am sorry for the not english proficient guys at my site), but by speaking to them and telling the situation from my eyes and digging as deep in each case even if it’s out of my hands they end up absolutely satisfied with my service.\n\nIn any case, i feel like I’m being paid to play a video game, a rather boring and repetitive one. The hardest part is waking up on time. In the meantime I’ve turned my life around, I have a good paying stable career. I get paid to work unlike college where you pay to work. I’m already a mix use employee, sometimes I take calls, sometimes I train, sometimes I just assist supporting agents. I get respect, and am seen as the know it all guy in the floor. \n\nI know Call Centers get bad rep, but I think I landed in a nice place. 2 years here and despite still planning on finishing Architecture (archi-torture), am fine at my current station.",

She wants everything to be perfect- making happy customers, the policies and procedures to be followed the way they should, and the representatives achieving their targets, meeting and exceeding the customers' demands NO MATTER WHAT coz how dare you not make an upset customer happy by the end of the call?!\n\nA week ago I got a call from a senior customer who wanted an update on their statements(physical copy because they could not do online banking). The customer asked why they had not gotten the statements lately. So I looked into their account details and assured them the statements were indeed sent out a couple of weeks ago and advised them to check their mailbox. Everything looked fine because we had their right address and the statements were mailed out. It might have been delayed because of snowstorms lately.\n\nI could have advised the customer to wait for another week and check again later, but if the customer calls back for the same issue, it will affect my and the team's score which my Manager will definitely dislike. I was compelled to make a new request. So I made a case request for mailing new copies of the statements. The bank charges $5.00 for statement reprints. I told them we will have to charge the reprint fees and then make reimbursement in the same amount as they never received the statements in the first place. The customer was fine with this resolution. I then got their consent to charge them the above-stated fees, proceeded to make the case request, issued the statements, and made the reimbursement. I could sense the customer was happy by this point in time. He thanked me for all my assistance. I wrapped up the call and proceeded with the rest of my day.\n\nSeconds after I clocked out, I got an email from my Manager saying my bonus will be deducted for the month because I did not charge the fees. I got my bonus docked for literally doing everything my Manager and the customer wants. :/",

I ended up with this dicksmack who ordered a treadmill and it only got as high as me bc he was flipping out on every person he spoke to, swearing/physical threats/making fun of and mocking some of our agents (because English is not their first language/they have an accent)/inappropriate innuendos and comments, etc because it hadn't been delivered yet - it had just been ordered 3 days earlier... 🙄 If anyone's ordered large workout equipment with full delivery and assembly, then you know typically a 3rd party handles the freight, not necessarily the direct company you order it from &amp; it arrives usually within a week of it being ordered. They source it out. It's stupid, but it is what it is. We received confirmation from the delivery company that not only was it delivered, there was a signature on file and a photo of the delivery. He says he never got it and they rescheduled a bunch of times, blah blah.\n\nI was getting real sick of his shit and the way he was treating my people so I told him to stop swearing and to talk to the agents respectfully, otherwise I wouldn't be helping him any further. He was yelling because I didn't get back to him for 2 days. I was out of the office due to a fucking death in the family and had my out of office on which said I was out with no access to emails. I receive an email from him telling me not to \"email him my feelings\" and me \"being out of the office with no access to emails is an embarrassing excuse\" regardless of the reason. He went on and on, \"don't tell me how to speak, you should've had someone follow up with me, i had no idea you were out, I have cameras, no one delivered anything, i don't give a shit about anything, you didn't refund me right away and purposely made me wait for my refund because you were mad, etc\". I told him the refund would take 1-3 days to process &amp; I'd notify him once completed. Our team didnt even process his fucking refund until the day I returned to the office (still within the 1-3 days btw) and i notified him as soon as I got in. I would have been OOO anyways those two days due to my work schedule and I don't have anyone to delegate to. The buck stops with me. There is no \"get me your supervisor\" or \"if you won't do it, get me someone who can\" shit, because there literally is no one else. Obviously i have a boss, but they dont deal with this shit. It's like that meme when they ask for the manager, and the same associate spins around and says \"how can I help you?\"\n\nHe received a full refund, with shipping refunded (over $2,000) AND got his fucking treadmill, and still was acting like this. I sent him the bitchiest, yet professional email I've sent in a long time explaining that i simply requested he speak respectfully since we are adults that no one made him \"wait\" for his refund, that my OOO provided an alternate contact while I was out. he definitely got the OOO msg since he sent me 7 emails within those 2 days, so there was SOMEONE he could've reached out to if he really wanted an update (the other agents can actually read so they'd be able to see the refund wasn't done yet and update him accordingly at least, even if they have limited visibility otherwise). \n\nI deal with angry, escalated crazies on the daily. I almost always have them eating out of my hand by the end of it, I'm very good at deescalating and making sure the customers issue is resolved in a way that makes them feel heard, validated and that they received a fair resolution. but boy oh boy he got under my skin. \n\nTo put the cherry on the sundae, he sent a survey (haven't gotten mine yet, cant wait) and another agent below me had the balls to email him &amp; be like \"I'm here to make sure you're 100% satisfied, i know the previous agent was unhelpful...\". I want to smack the ever living shit out of him. Way to make me look like an asshole.\n\nEnd rant. Just needed to get this off my chest and people who aren't in customer service don't always understand the kind of restraint you have to have with some of these fucknuts. i hope his treadmill malfunctions and he smacks his face so hard off of the floor he forgets his momma.\n\nHave a great weekend!",

(Which tells me she’s more than aware this isn’t happening)\nMind you, she’s been calling all day and bitching out various customer service people (I REALLY wish I reviewed those notes before I called)\n\nSo I start another spiel “I see in our notes that our clinical dietitian called your Dr office, dr. (Name) and—“\n\nHOW DARE YOU? How dare YOU call behind MY BACK and get a prescription without telling ME first? You broke hipaa laws!\n\nMa’am I don’t obtain the prescrip—\n\nYOU are not a clinician. You HAVE to go through me for anything I AM THE POA I AM HIS MOM. \n(At this point she’s ranting so I set my headset aside and start filling out for a manager call and alert the RD for her area)\n\n“We do have clinicians on service—“\n\nDid you HEAR ME can you put your LISTENING ears on?\n\n“I did hear you. I’m letting you know that we have” (at this point I’m trying to talk over her “clinicians who obtained this to ensure your son doesn’t go without”\n\nYOU ARE STILL TALKING OVER ME \n\n*sigh* yes ma’am. Ok ma’am. \n\nAt this point I say we are at a stalemate because we don’t have what you need and I can’t help you so I will have my manager give you a call and I will disconnect. \n\nYou know what? I don’t CARE if your manager calls because I AM going to the state AG for you breaking HIPAA laws!”\n\nOk ma’am. Yes ma’am. Thanks. *click*\n\nFun facts: If she would’ve hushed I could’ve explained that Boost VHC is nutritionally equivalent and her insurance has already paid for it. \nAlso her insurance didn’t cover his fiber supplement. Oh well. \nShe said she had receipts of all she purchased Bc we won’t send her formula (yeah we are causing the back order) good luck Bc your insurance already would’ve covered something else that was cheaper to boot. \n\nLast but not least, no hipaa laws broken so if she really goes to the AG they will laugh her out the building.",

        "text": "Just discovered this subreddit and even though I've been out of the call center for a little over a decade now, I'm sure some will appreciate my old-timer war stories.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I worked at a cell phone company in their fraud department. Our department wasn't staffed 24x7, so if someone called in reporting potential fraud during our off hours (or sometimes if our hold time was super long), whoever was taking the call would fill out a ticket that would route to us and then we'd investigate and call the customer/person who called back.\n\nI remember it was a beautiful summer day, back when that company had a relaxed dress code and guys could wear shorts and T-shirts in the office. I'd just started my swing shift and was sitting in an area where the night shift wouldn't arrive for a few hours, so it was empty and beautifully quiet, with about 4 or 5 rows of cubes to the nearest person or supervisor. The first ticket I open looks typical, with the person's name, the box checked that they aren't a customer, the credit card number and amount billed. But here's where it gets interesting, because the notes on the ticket say something along the lines of, \"DOCTOR WOMAN'S NAME IS 97 YEARS OLD. YOU MUST REFER TO DOCTOR WOMAN'S NAME AS DOCTOR. SPEAK LOUDLY. DOCTOR WOMAN'S NAME IS HARD OF HEARING. YOU WILL NEED TO BE VERY LOUD!\" And yes, this was in all caps, even though that field on the ticket would allow you to put upper and lower case in (this was the early 2000s, we still had systems that only did all caps). Plus, the other fields on the ticket were in upper and lower case, so I know that the person who entered the ticket wasn't the type to just leave caps lock on for everything (did I mention this was the early 2000s? People would do that for some reason).\n\nI steeled myself for what was quite clearly going to be the worst call imaginable. Every time I'd ever spoken to anyone that insisted on being referred to as \"doctor\" had been difficult/impossibly high expectations. Plus, whoever filed that ticket used all caps. So I dial out.\n\nCX: Hello?\n\nMe: Hi, I'm trying to reach Doctor Woman's Na-\n\nCX: HELLO? \n\nMe (louder): Hi I'm calling for Doctor Woman's Name? \n\nCX: This is she, but you're going to need to speak up! I'm 97 years old!\n\nMe (even louder): OK! My name is avgheight510 and I'm calling from the cell phone compa-\n\nCX: WHAT?\n\nMe (literally shouting loud enough that people are starting to look from 4 rows away): This is avgheight510! I'm calling from cell phone company about the charge on your credit card!?!?\n\nCX: Oh, we figured that out, I paid for my son's bill!\n\nMe: Oh that's great, I'-\n\nCX: WHAT?\n\nMe (as loud as I can without having someone come check on me): That's great to hear, Doctor Woman's Name! Was there anything else I could assist with while we're on the line?\n\nCX: WHAT?\n\nMe (practically screaming): Is there anything else I can help you with?!?\n\nCX: You wouldn't happen to have an extra pair of legs there would you? Mine don't work so good anymore.\n\nMe (laughing): I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we don't sell those here!\n\nCX: You know, when I was a little girl, we went to the world's fair in New York! And I remember when I saw television for the first time!\n\nMe: That sounds in-\n\nCX: WHAT?\n\nMe (so loud that out of the corner of my eye I see an entire row of people suddenly turn to look at me): That sounds incredible!\n\nCX: Oh I thought it had to be magic, seeing the man from across the room in that little box! (chuckles) Well, goodbye!\n\n\\*click\\*\n\nAnd that's why I call this the best most disappointing call I ever had at that place. Somehow not getting in trouble for literally yelling at a customer, getting to talk to someone who obviously had to bust through some glass ceilings to be a doctor in that era, and to have witnessed firsthand how our lives had changed since nearly the turn of the century... I genuinely wanted to stay on to hear more of her life story, but she hung up before I even had the chance to close the call!",

        "text": "Heya guys I've just had about enough of my co-workers and thought I'd rant here, sorry for this!\n\n\nFor context I work for a company that sells CRM software to potential clients and we just chat with them, I am also considered \"off-shore\" since I am working here in southeast asia (sorry not sure what term to use here!).\n\nWe have a tracker that we use to put in the customers info when they chat in and our QA takes his pick from here (fuck QA).\n\nSo when we take chats and after 48 hours the ticket gets routed to our 48 queue where we need to close the ticket, to make things easier we can go to our colleagues trackers and copy and paste it on ours and mark it as solved.\n\nThis is where my rant comes in:\n\nSome of my workmates DO NOT put in the full details of the customer and I need to manually search for it the info again! I complained about this to my TL and she talked to the offshore TL about this (amazing my TL actually did that!) and they brushed it off saying: \"So what? Your agents do it too!\"\n\nWhich isnt too far off, yes some of us forget to do it, but for the others its like 50% of the info no being available! To makes things worse the biggest offender was the ex-boyfriend of the offshore TL and a lazy single mother who gets \"overwhelmed\" when taking 3 chats at once (I'll rant about this bitch some other time and no shade thrown at single mothers! Just this particular officemate!) who get defended rendering our complaints invalid.\n\nMan, this really sucks especially if you have no say in it and the person committing these offenses was an ex or people in the same country as them! To make things worse, the offshore TL went through all the reports and found faults in all of us! \n\nThe infairness and bias is through the roof and god I wish I could fight these assholes on the street and give them a beating of a lifetime... Alas it cant be done...\n\nFuck biases, fuck this TL. Rant over.",

        "text": "I work for a cell phone company. This is a story for a customer that called in the other day. I figured this group would laugh at this.\n\nSo in the mobile phone wars, almost every company is giving out incentives to switch over to them, mine included. We had a lady that was ported for over a month previously, call me in asking about her rebates. 200 per line was owed to her that I can see in the notes and doing a little digging, they were deemed invalid. Huh let me take a further look. \n\nAfter doing some more intense checking it notated that her devices needed to be on monthly payments. I asked her did you pay off these phones at purchase? She said what, I didn't pay them off. Well it says here that you own them outright with no device payments at all, and the rebates are for devices that have payments. She states well I didn't pay them off. So after further checking there was an error in which yes she should have monthly payments but they were cancelled thus giving her two brand new iphone 14 pro max for free. (2400 in phones for free)\n\nWell during this time I'm checking because it's a very rare call to see this she starts getting antsy. She then starts to yell at me telling me she has to go and what's taking so long. You are trying to take my rebates from me, my bill is far too high. Your company is a lying sack of sh*t and I'm going to go back to the original company because you guys are trying to screw me over. I told her calmly that I am working to fix a few mistakes here and it's only going to be a bit longer. Now I have to place her on hold while I get help from another department to change back and put on monthly payments. She got mad and started going on again if I'm going to wait for you, you better fix my high bill and give me my rebates that I'm owed. I explained I'm going to do exactly that ma'am. After some huffing and puffing I got her on hold to fix all the things that needed to be fixed.\n\nI returned after a few moments with her of course fuming that I had to take the time to do this. Are you going to fix my bill and my rebates? Yes ma'am I got things fixed. Good I don't know if you are just not capable of doing your job but this is outrageous and I demand my bill be lowered. She started to be little me and basically act all high and mighty. So I let her continue her tirade for a moment, but then I butted in. She goes ok well what is taking so long then?\n\nHere comes probably the best revenge I could have gotten even though it's only a small victory. I explained that someone messed up and you were going to get your phones for free but since you were so adamant about calling in and getting your rebates, I put back on the monthly payments and got everything situated. You are going to get your 200 rebates on both lines. Oh and about your bill it's now going to be 50 more a month because there were no device payments on it to begin with. Your rebates are coming via email. Check for them in a few weeks. \n\nShe just sat there in stone cold silence for about 30 seconds. Ma'am are you still there? She goes yes so you mean to tell me that if I did not call I would have fully paid off phones and my bill would be less? That is exactly what I'm telling you ma'am. You have a blessed day.\n\nMaybe she will learn the lesson that if you are rude and going off about things you know nothing about, it might save you in the future. I hung up the call and laughed all the way until the next one funneled itself in.",

Absolutely pissed his home got flooded and wants to report his machine is possibly defective so that if needed after the delivery team comes back out to verify installation he can get a replacement. \n\nCX - I received my washer yesterday and the delivery team refused to hook it up. My mother in law was home for the delivery and they told her the tubes we have don't fit. When I got home I looked and they definitely did so they just didn't want to do the installation that I paid for. \n\nMe - I'm so sorry to hear that. Just for confirmation the installation was free and I do see you are on schedule for a service tech to come out to finish that installation. We're you calling to check on your service time.\n\nCX - No, I'm calling because my whole house was flooded because the water wouldn't shut off. I had to drain the washer myself and clean every room. I just got off with (brand name of washer) and they are refusing to see this as defective. But I want it noted that this problem is happening so if I need a replacement...\n\nMe - just to make sure I understand, the delivery team told your mother in law that the tubes didn't fit, by our notes they said they weren't long enough. You then proceeded to do the install yourself turned the machine on and walked away. And the machine as a result leaked so much that it flooded several rooms in your house. And you want me to notate it as that. \n\nCX - Yes because (Brand name of washer) is saying its an installation error. \n\nMe - (internally: it is an installation error it leaked from the damn tubes that weren't long enough...)\n\nAlso Me: I understand I will notate in your account everything you just stated one moment. \n\nCX - thank you. \n\nToday I go back in because I'm a little nosey and see notes that the installation ended successful but customer wanted to get compensation for damages or file a claim. Agent told them they couldn't do compensation for damage he caused per previous notes (my notes) and that if they filed an insurance claim the adjuster would see the notes that you did the installation that led to the water damage. \n\n(Some of that is assumptions based on notes agent left)\n\nFor me it's just hilarious that he spoke to the brand name that told him you caused this mess. I explained to him that your asking me to notate that YOUR FAILURE to listen to the delivery team caused flooding and you want me to notate this to protect you.... Okay buddy. I'm happy to assist. \n\nI just wish I could see his face or hear his voice when it dawned on him.",

We had an equal amount of reps staffed for day &amp; evening shift, so the calls were pretty consistent all throughout the day. Unless it was a really busy time of month, we'd have at least a 2 minute wait between calls pretty much all day. \n\nAbout 2 months ago, they hired some new guy to take over workforce management and scheduling. Since bringing him on, I've noticed a change in staffing. We're overstaffed during the day, sitting and waiting 6-8 minutes between calls. But on the evening shift (2-11pm), which I work, he has only about 10-12 of us staffed and we're slammed all night, with people waiting 30 min to and hour to get through. And when they do, they're pissed because they had to wait. I just don't understand wtf this new guy is doing...and why the higher ups aren't doing anything about his crazy schedules. I feel like this needs to be addressed, but feel like nothing will come out of me saying anything, so why bother 🙄 All I know for sure, is that I'm sick of it.",

        "text": "I work at a call center for an electric utility company.  This time of year is especially busy for us because it’s essentially high bill season for many of our customers.  People call in because their bills range anywhere between $50 -$200 higher in some cases that I’ve seen and that does alarm many people.  \n\n  Which I get it, a bill that high could be a bit too much for anyone.  And that’s what I’m here for, to help people pay off and/or explain their high bills to them.   \n\nThe things that drive me crazy is when people argue back with us for 20 minutes about how we are over charging them and gouging them as well.  I have to explain that my bills are high as well this time of year.  Winter is a rough time for us all.   I wish our furnaces were more electric efficient than they were, alas they are not.    \n\nThe equally frustrating and funny part of this time of year is that it seems as much as 80% of the customers I talk to apparently don’t use some sort of heating.  No one ever uses their heaters, no one ever turns on their tv, people barely flush their toilets so why should we be charging so much.  \n\nI understand too there are genuinely a chunk of customers that use those propane space heaters that don’t plug into the walls at all or use wood heaters, so we have to take those reports with a grain of salt.  But if most everyone doesn’t use their electricity then why does every single winter season cause your usage to go up?   Do you not remember last year at this time?   \n\nOh but your neighbor’s electric isn’t as high as yours?  I can’t speak about your neighbor’s house, I can only speak to you about yours.  There’s a handful of reasons as to why that could be.   \n\nAnother thing that drives me crazy is when people accuse us of gouging them in a regular basis.  They swear they made a payment with us.   I have to go over with them that yes, indeed we received a payment, but that was not enough to cover what was owed. Unfortunately this isn’t exactly a situation where just whatever you send us is good enough. We have to have exactly what’s how to make sure it’s not going to become past due later.  \n\n  Again, I am glad to go over this and help people have options to pay off what’s owed. Just the overall attitude and snippy nature that people have that so we are always in the wrong things to get to me every once in a while. \n \nWhat’s something about the customers you deal with that drive you crazy as well?",

So the main part of my job it to answer general questions about people’s accounts, helping people set up new ones at new locations, close their ones from the places they moved away from, etc.  \n\nThis particular customer called in, confused about her bill. I was glad to help and was able to help Dave into what she was confused about. Though it seems she was not able to unclench her teeth from what she was thinking what was going on.   \n\nC:  customer \nM:  me \n\nC:  hello, yes, I was wanting to make sure my account was closed back on the 30th of December when I originally called to close it.   I got his other bill and wanted to make sure I was not being charged anymore.  \n\n*we verified and pull up the account *\n\nM:  oh yes, this account was closed as you said on the 30th of December.  The bill for. $XXX was just the final bill. When the account closes when you take one final meter reading of what power was used since the last film we charge it for and then we see that you.  \n\nC:  oh, ok.  However the bill says it is due on January 20th.   I didn’t live there January 20th.  I already moved out by December 30th.  \n\nM:  yes indeed.   Even though this is a final bill it works just like a regular one.  We give you some time to be able to receive the bill and then pay it after we read the meter for you.  \n\nC:  But I didn’t live there on January 20th.  I shouldn’t be charged for January 20th.   \n\nM:  I understand.  We’re not charging you for January 20th.  Again, that’s just the date we issued as it was due before it is considered past due.   We’re not charging for the date.  \n\nC:  but the bill says for January 20th.   This bill should go to the owner of the place, not me.  \n\nCue this going back and forth with me stating this in different ways for a couple minutes before I realize I have to I have to take a different approach.  I direct her more closely on the bill.  \n\nM:  do you see on the left side where it says on bold letters, “term of service”?  \n\nC:  yes.  \n\nM:  do you see where it says from December 2 to December 30th?\n\nC:  yes.  \n\nM:  ok so that is the dates time period that we are charging for. As you recall, you said that you close this out on 30 December. That’s why that says the term of service ended on the 30th like the bill says.  \n\nC:  but the top of the bill says January 20th.  And also that this was for January 3rd.  I didn’t live there from January 3rd through the 20th.  \n\nM:  and what does it say about January 20th?  \n\nC:  the bill is due on or before January 30th.  \n\nM:  right, so that means that we would ask you to pay the bill by that date. That’s the only thing that the 20th is being referred to for asking you to pay the bill by the 20th because that’s when we set it to be due.  You mentioned the January 3rd.  What does the bill say about the 3rd?  \n\nC:  the mailing date of the bill is January 3rd.  \n\nM:  that means that is the date that we actually mail the bill to you. We were the meter on the 30th and compiled a bill for you and then mailed it to you on the 3rd.  \n\nA long pause is on the other end of the line.  After a while, I then finally tell her again  \n\nM:   So that’s what I mean.  We aren’t charging you for the 3rd through the 25th.   Those are other details about the bill, particularly of which when it’s due.    \n\nC:  I want to talk to your manager.  \n\n\n\n\nI then got her in touch with my manager and explain the situation and noted it as such. Why is it so difficult to get through to some people?",

Today I got two.  Both wanting to talk about their bills and are confused about them.  I may post the other on another story to keep this one reasonably shorter.   \n\n  So Normally I’m glad to help so I dove right into the issue and looked into these with them.   \n\nThe first customer was confused why she owed so much. Went like this:  \n\nM = me   \nC = customer    \n\nC:   Why does my bill show I owe $XXX? I had an agency help me out and got my account caught up last month.   \n\nM:  I’d be glad to look into this…. Ah yes, we did receive a payment on 12/7/22 for $XXX, however the whole account balance at that time was slightly higher at $XXX.  So they did pay off most of it, yes.  However also since then two different bills came out.  One on 12/13/22 we read your meter for the $XX that’s currently past due as well.  Also on 1/13/23 we read the meter again so that’s why the bill indicates $XX is also included.  But that’s not past due that’s owed by 2/3/23 so you have time to pay that.  \n\nC:   There’s no way I have a bill already for February!  That’s bull****!  \n\nM:  well we hadn’t charge you for February. We just give you some time to be able to pay the bill that just came out—-   \n*She cuts me off*  \n\nC:  That still can’t be right, the agency paid off all what was owed for me so I shouldn’t owe anything.   \n\nI went into again now the bills worked and cue me explaining the due dates and date we read the meters, that we don’t read her meter  for the bill on the first of the month, but she cuts me off again before I get very far.  She starts speaking in a slow condescending tone.\n\nC:   So here’s what you’re going to do.  You’re going to send someone out here to look at my meter so you can have my bill be right.  Now can you manage that at least for me?  \n\nI didn’t say much, just realized she isn’t going to let me speak, so I got her ahold of the department that we escalate these matters to after I explained that’s what I’m doing next.  And that department is the one that may be able to get someone out there.  \n\nI understand it can be frustrating",

She eventually called and complained so much that my team lead, with whom she was on a first-name basis by that time, had to file a restraining order on her. We were no longer escalating the calls, just hearing her rant. One day her son finally calls in and explains she has mental issues. Oh really? No kidding! She kept calling lol.",

        "text": "I work in reservations for a popular hotel chain, and ever since COVID hit, we've all been working from home and keeping in touch via a group chat. I've been with this company for 3.5 years, and though we do get our fair share of buttholes, they're still a dime a dozen and I love it here.\n\nSince I have experience, I like to keep an eye on the chat and help people out when needed. Our supervisors often get busy, and can't answer every question in a timely manner, so I try to help them out where I can. I also used to work in the complaint department, so I know the ins and outs of how certain things are handled. Sometimes even more so than our sups!\n\nToday was particularly slow which meant I was spending most of my time watching the chats, when I saw something very disterbing. One of our female agents posted how she's been waiting on this guy's card for over half an hour, but he claimed he couldn't find it. Instead, he was going on and on about how his wife would hogtie him, and would even imply that he wanted our female agent to hogtie him too! THREE more female agents chimed in saying they had the same guy, and he NEVER found his card!\n\nI remembered the last time someone had reported sexual harassment from a client in the chat, and they were told to sent a sup the phone# so they could be blocked. No sups were responding atm, as it was just 1 sup and her boss for the next half hour, so I took action. I advised her to take the guy's phone# off her caller ID and DM it to the sup, so they could have the guy blocked for sexual harassment. Four calls in a row where he supposedly doesn't know he needs his card to book the room, and spends half an hour searching for his card while going on about his sexual fantasies is CLEARLY intentional. I also tagged the sup, and she eventually took notice and said she would escalate it.\n\nI thought it was done, but a half hour later, ANOTHER girl was complaining about some client not providing their card. I asked her if he was going on about being hogtied, and she said yes! Two more sups had logged in by then(one was mine), so I tagged them and the first sup. My sup gave her his extension to have the client transferred to him, and the guy immediately hung up. I'm typing this up during my lunch break, so I'll update if anything else happens, since this last incident happened right before I left.\n\nDude, we are not THAT kind of call center! If you want THOSE kinds of services, there are actual hotlines you can call instead!",

Annoying, false personality, micromanaging, seems like a general snake in the grass.

I speak at as it is. So far, I’ve been promised a raise which hasn’t been actioned and I’ve passed my trial period, but no review/confirmation has been given. \n\n\nSomewhat concerned as this new management hails from a nation …not well known for its race relations and two of the others let go were minorities themselves. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any experience like this?",

Conversational authentication should happen instead, the note said. \n\nFeels  unrealistic. Ik I’m not a robot on authentication. Clients know the deal (well most do, some don’t understand why no instant access). \n\nOther jobs have reviews or coaching moments. I have pretty good surveys for the most part and am tired of feeling like I have to agree with managers in 1:1’s. Can push back a little or refute their takes mildly. But I feel compelled to nod and say yeah i see what you’re saying, I’ll try to do better! \n\nManagers say to ask more questions to expand the conversation also. I don’t feel like every call needs to be “expanded.” I personally feel its less scripted and more authentic to answer questions without smiley/folksky nonsense (being told to wow the client). \n\nCall reviews are demoralizing and unwinable, it feels like.

After my standard classroom training and Y-Jacking in to listen to calls, it's time for me to take one while jacked in with the existing team member. \n\nThe caller got escalated because he wanted 5 years written off automatic renewals for our software.  We used to beat customers over the head with auto renewal reminders. We'd send an email 90 and 30 days before the charge and you'd get a receipt the day of.  We also notified customers through the product of upcoming expirations. Also, i poitlnted out these charges would be on his credit card statement. So since he confirmed he was using the email address and we confirmed he was actively using the product we denied his refunds beyond the first year, but offered 1 free year as compensation. \n\nThe customer is furious demanding we give him back every auto renewal since he signed up 5 years ago,  claiming he had no idea he was being charged. I denied him,  again because he was using the product and he threatened to dispute the charges with his credit card company.  I told him that he's welcome to try but most credit card companies put limits on how long you can wait before you dispute a charge.  I told him that his bank word likely remind him that it's his responsibility to check this statements monthly to prevent this kind of thing from happening. \n\nHe got quiet and said \"OK, I'll take the free year.\" \n\nI processed his refund and free year and sent him on his way.   After I hung up,  the team member I was sitting with took off his headset and shouted to our manager \"He's ready.\"",

        "text": "I work in a call centre. It's a small-ish, family owned business, so we managers wear many hats.\n\nAnother post reminded me of this story from around fifteen years ago when I was just a team leader.\n\nOur sales team had sold a customer a landline phone package, as a verbal contract. \n\nAs a result the admin team had, as per the regs, posted them their contact pack. At this point the customer has, by legislation, ten days to change their mind and cancel.\n\nOn day 11, our team has applied to move the phone service from the big national brand company (who used to be the single publicly owned supplier before the government broke them up &amp; privatised them in the 90’s) to our service.\n\nThis leads to the customer phoning up, spitting their dummy out as they never signed the paperwork nor posted t back. It transpired that the customer assumed that they would have to sign. To be fair, we’d only had verbal contracts since the law was changed in 2000, so at this point a lot of people hadn’t interacted with them. However, as they didn’t want it, they’d simply binned the paperwork.\n\nI gently explained that they had a “common misunderstanding”, but legally, as a business owner, they where “reasonably expected to know” basically what I’d explained above.\n\nBut, we don’t want angry customers, they’re not worth it. So, I use my little bit of power to offer to let them leave back to big national brand company, and all they’d have to do is pay for the services they used while with us. To accomplish this, they would simply have to call big national brand company and ask to move back.\n\nThey refused. They refused to pay us at all under any circumstances. And they demanded we put them back with big national brand company as it was, apparently, our fault.\n\nThe thing was, you can’t unilaterally put your customer with another company. Otherwise, we’d just forcibly shift all out bad customers away. This lead to us arguing in circles, until the customer hung up on me.\n\nA week later, it was billing day, and the customer’s bill was posted to them, due for payment by the Thursday. No payment was forthcoming., so on the Friday our Collections team called them, only to be told where to go. All right then.\n\nWe closed for everything except for emergency maintenance at 1630. At 1629, the Provisioning team deactivated all services (except 999/emergency, and calling in to us to pay your bill) for all customers who had not paid or made arrangements with Collections. Including these jokers.\n\nNow, these where the days when the intermewebs where not quite ubiquitous, and businesses still relied on the phone a \\*lot\\*. \n\nThus, on Monday, the customer called in on a mobile, absolutely incandescent with rage. We where crippling their business. Fun times. We told them that once they had cleared their bill, they where free to leave, and we would refund any over-payment, but they would still need to ask big national brand company to take them back. I was hung up on again.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the customer, who was based around ten miles away, barged into out building, marched into the first office she could find, and picked up and threw a monitor at our Accountancy junior. A 21” CRT monitor. For those too young to remember such things, those things weighed around around 35-40kg.\n\nThankfully, it was wired into the PC under the desk and simply moved in an arc to smash onto the floor as it couldn’t get anywhere. Needless to say, the police where called.\n\nThe customer never did pay nor get their number released. Likely cost them a small fortune as they where too stubborn &amp; prideful to accept help.",

        "text": "**Prologue**\n\nWhen someone, anyone, customer or otherwise says \"I know more about *x* than you\" it is highly likely that the person knows next to diddly fucking squat.\n\nI am not sure how it works in call centres in other countries but here in the UK, everyone gets taught the basics of financial laws. Not every law, not even every part of all the laws but rather an overview. Each agent **MUST** pass their exam every quarter. Laws covered include, but are not limited to; [Consumer Credit Act (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Rights_Act_2015) (hereafter referred as CCA), [GDPR](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection), and the [Bribery Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents). \n\nYou should know that every so often your bank and/or credit provider will ask you to verify your transactions before they allow the transaction to go through. This is done for but not limited to; anti scam, anti fraud, anti money laundering purposes. \n\nWith that, here is a tale about a time when a customer informed he knew more about the CCA than I did because I was just a call centre worker. \n\n&gt; **Peace:** Hello and welcome to [credit provider]. How can I help?\n\n&gt; **Karen:** You guys are stopping my payments. I'm going to sue you!!!\n\n\"*Oh. Fun!*\" I thought. Let's go. The following was what happened after security was done.\n\n&gt; **Karen:** So *as* I was saying, all of my payments are being stopped! Do you know how embarrassing that is?! Do you?!!!\n\n&gt; Under the CCA! I CAN SUE YOU!!! IT'S MY MONEY!!!!\n\nNow, let's take a break here. Just to inform you guys of a tidbit you already know; when you are using a credit card it is not, and never will be your money. Anyway, back to the show.\n\n&gt; **Peace:** I'm sorry to hear that. Were all payments stopped and were they online transactions?\n\n&gt; **Karen:** Yes! You know I can sue you! Read the CCA!! It SAYS SO IN BLACK &amp; WHITE!!!!\n\n&gt; **Peace:** Well I mean, no it doesn't(?).\n\n#STOP! NEVER CORRECT A CUSTOMER WHEN THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG!\n\nOh lord. I just annoyed the customer even more. No payments were even stopped by us. I should have just said that. \n\n&gt; **Karen:** Don't you dare disrespect my intelligence! You're just a call centre worker. What could you know about the CCA more than me?! I don't even want to speak to your superior because they'll just be as dumb as you. Expect a letter from my lawyer!!!\n\n[*Click*]\n\nIt has been weeks. I have not yet been given info as to the ETA of this letter. Do you think her lawyers threw her out of their office? I'd certainly like to think so.",

        "text": "So today is certainly turning out to be a friday the 13th. I don’t know if my customers are just extra stupid today. If I’m just extra impatient today cause I got up early to do overtime or what. I had a customer argue with me about an escrow analysis that she wants ran when we have one being ran for her next month so we will not do one. I told her four times and she goes. Yes I heard you the first time but you’re not helping me so I want to speak to someone else and like I’m not helping you how? And she goes well. The other agents would help me calculate everything so I was like OK bitch I didn’t know you wanted me to calculate anything for you. I’ll do that.\n\nThen I had a customer that I told eight times that we are not his insurance agency. If he has any insurance related calls, he needs to contact them here then proceeded to ask me an additional eight times to update his policy. I finally told him so this is your mortgage company we work with mortgages we do not work with your insurance. If you have an insurance related issue, you need to contact them.\n\nThen I had a woman today that very well went up with her name stake. If you have guessed it Her name is Karen. She was upset about not being able to get into our website. I explained to her the issue and she just continued to yell at me and chew me out and tell me that I websites incorrect and that she’s right, so I transferred her.\n\nThen I had a customer who argued with me for about 20 minutes where her payment was miss applied. I explained that it wasn’t that it is correct and she went on to say that it is the age of anima Tronics and automation so we should be able to update her payment correctly so that she can see it on the website and she just chewed me out for like 20 minutes .\n\nMost of these customers did ask for a supervisor and at my company we’re not able to transfer them to supervisors. It hurts our metrics and we get put on a list stating that we can’t handle our calls.  \n\nPlease someone just shoot me.",

        "text": "This is going to be a quick short one, but I feel very satisfied about it.\n\nI have been working at this call centre working for a large retailer for about 11 months, with a contract for 12 months. This is my third call centre job and I wasn't really planning on staying. So I just kept my head low and did my calls. I am not a lazy person. I don't mind having to pick up a call 1 minute before my shift ends or having to clock my breaks by the exact minute. What I am, is petty. See at this call centre we are pretty overstaffed. So there is some time between calls. Sometimes it is minutes and the most I have personally had is an half-hour between calls. So I enjoyed those moments. One thing I noticed is when you clock back in from your break is that your are thrown in the front of the call queue and get a call immediately. This seemed unfair to me and as another way they try to squeeze another minute of productivity out of you at these centres even though there have been a dozen other agents waiting in queue. Well I figured out around 2 months in that if you just relog into everything when your break ends you get thrown at the back of the queue as you should. Well fast-forward to present time and I get a message from my manager asking to speak to me. She asks me why I have been logging out after the end of my break. I tell her I like to relog as our calling system sucks ass and I like a \"fresh start\". Well she sees right to my lie and tells me that she thinks I have been circumventing the queue. I act like I have no idea what she is talking about. She goes right to tell me that they won't be renewing my contract. I smiled and asked her if I can get that in writing (we talked a bit more, but just pretend I walked away here lol). \n\nYou see I live in an European country and while they have no legal obligation to renew my contract they do have to tell me a month before that they won't renew it. Which she was too late to do. I asked a friend of mine who works as a legal representative at an union to write me a sternly worded letter and I got a nice compensation from a job I was going to quit anyway.",
