Looking it up on Google doesn’t give me the info I’m looking for. \n\nI recently was discussing a possible client and asked if they were ok with C2C. She said yes but continued to refer to our arrangement as “1099”. I kept reiterating C2C just to be safe, but can someone explain the difference? How is C2C paid vs 1099? I know 1099 contractors get a…1099, but what does someone working C2C (single member LLC/one employee) get paid with?\n\nAnd what’s the difference between C2C as a single member LLC/single employee vs having more than one employee? Someone recently mentioned I should let potential clients know that I own my LLC and I’m the only employee vs just saying “C2C”, so what’s the difference? Why would one be preferred over the other?\n\nAlso, lastly, I recently spoke to a potential client and mentioned the above (C2C; single member LLC, etc) and they said they were ok with with that and actually “preferred” it over W2. Why would they prefer it? Is that a good thing for me (as in, is there some disadvantage for me that advantageous to them that I don’t know about)? \n\nPlease help, as I couldn’t find answers for these little nuanced questions on Google.",
