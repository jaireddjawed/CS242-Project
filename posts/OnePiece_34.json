        "text": "I didn't realize while I was reading Wano, but after the SBS revealed that Tama was a Korozumi, I think I'm starting to kind of dislike the entire Korozumi conflict. Tama being a Korozumi feels like Oda did a patch job to a story issue that goes against his normal writing philosophies. Let me explain:\nIf we ignore the SBS, then the only Korozumi's we know are evil as sin. Orochi, Kanjuro, Higurashi. All of them are evil. That by itself goes against Oda's normal philosophies, because he NEVER writes \"you are evil because of your family name\". There are good members of Vinsmoke and Linlin Even Celestial Dragons don't get this. There are good Celestial Dragons, as proven by almost every member of the Donquixote family we know. Until Oda retroactively told us about Tama, every member of the Korozumi family was evil traitors. \n\nEven the reasons for it make it feel like \"they're evil because they're Korozumi\". Orochi and Kanjuro were both taken in by Oden and treated respectfully by him. Orochi had Higurashi whispering in his ear, so I can look past that. But Kanjuro? He had no reason that we know of to betray Oden and Wano except for his name. He was named one of Oden's vassals, he was brothers to all of the Scabbards. The only reason given for why he is evil and betrayed Wano is \"my name is Korozumi\". That makes it feel like his family name is the reason he's evil. Also, ending Wano on \"Korozumi was born to burn\" is another thing that makes it seem like it is the family name, and not the fact that Orochi is an easily manipulated toady and Kanjuro is a traitorous snake.\n\nAll this to say, Tama should have been revealed as a Korozumi in the actual story, not in an SBS long after Wano concluded. That would have made it a lot better because it would show, just like every other evil family, they're not evil because their name is evil, they're evil for other circumstances (giving Kanjuro a real reason to betray Oden after everything Oden did for him would also help).",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11gohxx/the_lyrics_to_one_piece_opening_five_are/",
        "text": "Let's take a look at the lyrics in English:\n\n\"It's Alright! Now, let's move forward. There's always **a burning sun in our hearts.**  \n**Transferring Power** through our clasped hands, let's catch hold of **our desires.\"**\n\nBurning sun = Nika? Our desires, Transferring powers = How devil fruits are made?\n\nThis opening also came out during the Water 7/Enies Lobby saga, the first arc where the straw-hats are directly against the WG and we learn about the Ohara Incident, void century, and the ancient kingdom. From Egghead we know that the Ancient Kingdom was an advanced civilization that broke many scientific discoveries, like manifesting devil fruits through people's **desires.**\n\n\"Let's ride upon a huge wave, combining our Strengths.  \nLet's hurry towards the **beating pulse**; It's the signal to begin.\"\n\nDoes that remind you of anything? Kaido was announced [Victor](https://imgur.com/a/egZUoou) in his battle against Luffy, but then towards the end of Ch.1043, Zunesha hears the Drums of Liberation again for the first time in 800 years, signaling to Zunesha that JoyBoy has returned.\n\n\"Now is the time to set sail. When the anchor is raised,  \nWe’ll ride the seven-colored winds to the sea of adventure.\n\nThough it’s a voyage full of injury, something precious is there.  \nEven when we’re in trouble, no matter what, because I will protect you.\n\nIt’s Alright! Now, Let’s move forward. There’s always a **burning sun in our hearts.**  \nWhen storms come, Let’s stand shoulder to shoulder and **look at the light from before.**  \nIf we **gather** the shards of **our dreams**, **they will become a map for the future.**  \nAnd so, Let’s **stand together** **under the same flag,** and **catch hold of our desires.**  \nWe all are one, One Piece.\"\n\nWhen the storms come and looking at the light from before could potentially be a message the ancient kingdom is conveying after they realized JoyBoy won't come back anytime soon, but to keep hope and remember the Sun God and that things will be better in the future. This also goes hand-in-hand with the next line, of keeping their dreams intact because they'll be useful to take down the WG in the future.\n\nOn the flip side, this shows what the WG has done with their power as well. They've managed to get the whole world under the same flag, and catch a hold of devil fruits through various ways - Vegapunk devil fruit cloning, devil fruit encyclopedia, feeding DFs to Admirals, Cipher Pol, etc.\n\n“If we do it together, we can succeed! Combining our Hearts.  \n**The song** of the migrating birds. Turns to courage.\n\nEven though we don’t have **wings**, we are f**lying at ease in freedom.**  \nThe sky is capricious, so **let’s be allies**.\"\n\nThis line was interesting to me. Perhaps referring to being allies with the Lunarians?  \"If we can do it together, we can succeed!\" Could it be that the Ancient Kingdom tried to protect their kingdom by trying to ally with the Gods of the Red Line but failed to do so?  \n\n\n\"It’s alright! Yes, let’s move forward to those rainlike tears  \nWhen we return to the blue ocean, passion shines brightly.  \nAs heated thoughts gather, they call the endless winds.  \nAlways together under the same **star,** because we have an unbreakable bond.  \n**Let’s share these miracles**.\"  \n\n\nVegapunk talks about wanting to share his knowledge among the world. It's possible the Ancient Kingdom wanted the same, to share their achievements, but eventually there was a faction that came to power who opposed these ideologies and was greedy for power instead.",

        "text": "Forgive me if I don't remember some names, I'm not great with remembering Japanese names, but will indicate descriptions of the characters if I cannot remember their names.\n\nWe know Oda didn't go into Zoro's lineage bc he didn't want to make Wano any longer than it already was. That's reasonable as Wano was a REALLY LONG ARC, but I'm sure many would've loved having a couple chapters dedicated to connecting Zoro and Ryuma, even if we've speculated it as 100% since thriller bark.\n\nHow can it easily be done? Remember the weapons collector that could transform into a fox/dog (or whatever it was lmao) in Ringo (who Zoro fought for a bit)? If my memory is correct, there was a moment where the the weapons collector questioned Zoro why he had Shusui. Zoro refused and insisted it was gifted, but the weapons collector urged and fought him to give it back to the grave of Ryuma where it belongs.\n\nWe have confirmation Zoro is a descendant of the Shimotsuki clan through SBS 105, since Ushimaru is Zoro's Grand Uncle. Ushimaru is descended from Shimotsuki Ryuma, making Zoro also a descendant of Ryuma, go figure. We already speculated this for ages and this is just confirmation. But it would've been awesome if Zoro found out about his lineage at Ringo. It was a brilliant opportunity and would add to the weight of why Zoro is, by destiny, one of the few who can rightfully inherit Shusui, the black blade. Even if Zoro had to give back Shusui any way, it would've given him more character development, and only solidified his goal of becoming the greatest swords man that ever lived. If he knows the weight of his lineage of great swordsman ship and Wano Kuni, it would make him want to push even harder. \n\nIt's just such a missed opportunity, but I can see why Oda didn't. Like I said, Wano was already like 3 years long, and, even if it was just 2 chapters, it would drag it out even longer (as that's like 2-3 weeks extension on the arc). But I feel it would've been well worth it and made many fans very happy. There were other opportunities throughout Wano, but I find this to be the strongest one.",

A small story of Zoro getting captured by the WG. \n\n\n\n————————\n\nPresent time in Egghead island.\n\nAfter sending the Seraphim’s flying , the group of Luffy were alerted by a radiant light in the sky. Kizaru manifested himself , and sent lasers towards the 5. Everyone evaded the attack, and prepared themselves for a fight. Stella was surprised and shocked to see Kizaru attacking. It’s revealed to us that stella had formed somewhat of a relationship with a teen Kizaru. Regardless of the past relationship, Kizaru made him aware that he was there to capture Strawhat. Lucci and Kaku contemplated helping Luffy, but Luffy told them that there was no need. \n\nLuffy’s was angry. He remembered that it was Kizaru who tormented them in Sabaody , and it was his fault ultimately that his crew was separated. In a flash of second , Luffy sprung in the air… \n\nKizaru: … \n\nLuffy appearing above Kizaru, let out a powerful fist imbued with raw lighting. Kizaru tried to intercept it with two swords he materialize, but the punch overwhelmed him. Immediately Kizaru went flying downwards , impacting the floor with a thunderous crash. After a few seconds after the smoke cleared , we see Kizaru get up. Kizaru was bleeding from his mouth , and was shocked. \n\nKizaru: I never expected for you to grow this fast Strawhat Luffy… \n\n\n——————\n\nI have more to write , but I will wait until I get on my laptop. So far what do y’all think, should I continue? I can either post the completed version , or just edit this post.",

Not a small time investment sure, but people will look at One Piece as insurmountably long, but then play some 60-100 hour JRPG (like the persona series)  or watch some 200 episode sitcom 3 times in a year.  Sure the number 1000 seems like a lot, but a chapter takes less than 10 minutes to read.  JJBA is longer by page count than one piece is, but no one ever sees that as being inaccessible.  I think it is just one of those meme takes that has become exceedingly popular despite not having much weight.",

Because I feel like if it was, we wouldn't have needed to wait this long to get a reveal, and for that reveal to only happen via SBS.\n\nForget wano, I think the Zoro/Ryuma thing should have been revealed back in thriller bark, when Ryuma was first introduced.\n\nOda could have hyped up Zoro vs Ryuma by having Zoro reveal that his village was founded by samurai who left wano and that he is the descendant of some great samurai named Ryuma. If Oda revealed it then, I think that fight would have honestly been more interesting.\n\nRather, by never revealing in the manga and hinting at it in wano, Oda led fans to believe that Zoro's lineage was more important than it really was. That it was somehow relevant to the plot, despite this hardly being the case.\n\nOverall, I think the reason that this was never mentioned until recently was probably because it is a retcon. Its not that Oda named Shimotsuki village after the shimotsuki clan, Oda named the shimotsuki clan after Shimotsuki village in order to make fans think that this was all planned from the beginning. When honestly, I doubt it ever was.",

In chapter 1015 after luffy fell into the sea he communicated with Momonosuke using the voice of all things. Only Momonosuke could hear him so this kind of communication can only be done between people who can use that ability. So it is logical that both Shanks and Aramaki(or Ryokugyu) can hear the voice of all things",

Really think about it Don Krieg ruled the east blue he shared is power with no one he killed his enemy's. None of the 4 empires rule the grand line they had to share power, imagine not being strong enough to not defeat your enemy's. You remember when Don Krieg lifted that boat he is possibly the strongest in the world whos else lifts a whole ship BURGESS!? Krieg would spank Burgess like his son punches do nothing against Don Kriegs [**Wootz steel**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wootz_steel) **armor.** Besides that think how resource full Don Krieg is he is like batman he could make a weapon for any situation. His gas will kill anyone who doesn't have a mask , hell, give Don Krieg a day he might have a nuke in his drippy cloths. Speaking of look at the man dripped out asf he got the fur coat and the gold armor man looks like a a pimp, lex luthur and batman had a kid.",

I think it is hard (almost impossible) to keep in mind all threads Oda is currently pulling together, hence I came with this post. I'll try to submit it weekly to keep the pace with the course of events.\n\nWithout further do, let's begin with Blackbeard\n\n# I. Blackbeard &amp; Fullalead Island\n\nBlackbeard seems to be the focus point for the next saga.\n\n[Blackbeard is all out. He just attacked Hancock on her island and captured Koby. As a reminder, Aokiji \\(probably SWORD double agent tbh\\) has joined BB and Moriah was offered to join as well.](https://preview.redd.it/lywkxkcujela1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9c74f845709a9b8dc2d2ff34320c209dc8d99a71)\n\n[Blackbeard then ambushes Law at sea, right after our surgeon left Wano \\(and defeated an emperor by the way\\). Most think BB will steal Road Poneglyph rubbings. I think not.](https://preview.redd.it/nfcyj3ixjela1.jpg?width=1432&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=85bf3b418f57e07afa30f0671372202967198b67)\n\n[The Hero Garp is on its way to Fullalead Island, to save Captain Koby. He will certainly loose, reminded Ace's defeat back then.](https://preview.redd.it/oq4jfll3kela1.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1b28a88764ec3aaf2aee36b18a8a0b82833f7b03)\n\n[Among many prisoners, Blackbeard also jails Pudding. At the end of Wano, Morgans teased something regarding BigMom pirates on the move \\(they attacked Guernica\\). The crew may have rescued BM \\(or BM body?\\) and will probably set sail to Fullalead to save the little sister?](https://preview.redd.it/5mkxf3m7kela1.png?width=1390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bc1f598fd103ef5d3b01ed31df93865ab5e630c3)\n\n# II. Individuals on their move\n\nWe can't forget about these big figures moving forward\n\n[Boa is facing a hard truth, she can't stay on Amazon Lilly, for the Marines would attack without rest. She will probably set sail but where ? Gran fleet ?](https://preview.redd.it/zg941dlkkela1.jpg?width=732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e3125b462f28b347f1ccffe6819f92b1c0995ec6)\n\n[The Cross Guild is now a structured organization \\(a Yonko fleet some would argue\\). What will they do ? Assemble the remaining shichibukai \\(Weevil?\\) and enter the race for One Piece ?](https://preview.redd.it/0tu7gxlmkela1.jpg?width=1616&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3ff42e27216ae2285ddb2954a4270a7fd68b563f)\n\n[Miiss Buckin blames Marco for letting Weevil being capture by Aramaki. She certainly will make a move to see her beloved son again !](https://preview.redd.it/2vm3yakqkela1.jpg?width=722&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a8f97b869036cf5aa274f77ec4e3413344f99905)\n\n[Kaido &amp; BigMom have been thrown away with the volcanic eruption at the end of Wano. Are they dead ? ](https://preview.redd.it/fj28tagskela1.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb288914d7deb2b7c11389499860e39fcc1f6dd9)\n\n[Kid arrives at Elbaf, home of the giants. It is said he is looking for the man marked by flames \\(Jaguar D. Sauro, as confirmed by Vegapunk, is heavily marked by flames\\) but encounters ... Shanks](https://preview.redd.it/85w88iovkela1.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1f1ffd2d8ad25a97ab824e6d61158bf4655718a3)\n\n[Shanks about to steal another one-arm-red-haired-scared-pirate RP rubbings](https://preview.redd.it/q8da5uzxkela1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e779a5fe033173c2006387419495785090ef08ee)\n\n[After discovering that the empty throne is not so empty, Sabo was blessed with obliteration. Some say he was not on the island. I personally believe he is not dead](https://preview.redd.it/rm1uc9c0lela1.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=34cc136a986e4afa33dddb40916d7e3d40748669)\n\n[Vivi was rescued \\(along with Wapol\\) by Morgans. This unexpected party leaves me speechless](https://preview.redd.it/uhjv3mn6lela1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=92a13553c8ad55b5893e33d94d288b7b40a64b34)\n\n# III. Egghead scene\n\nOf course, Egghead is at full speed right now. I don't know whether we are going on a tower defense arc or an escape one.\n\n[On one hand, Sentomaru is raising an army to defend the island. On the other side, 100 marines ships are being deployed. Big skirmish incoming](https://preview.redd.it/9sar7119lela1.jpg?width=1112&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c51ad7e25b7e5f49e3ebd2d5d668577161a9a31a)\n\n[An admiral \\(Kizaru! Sentomaru's uncle\\/boss, depends on translations\\) is on its way with a  fuc\\*\\*\\*\\* GOROSEI Member :O](https://preview.redd.it/hy52snuelela1.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5ffbaec8bb57977fc3f1835f0976db8675a7a8a1)\n\n[Caribou is also on the island. This man is pretty harmless, but he knows the whereabouts of 2 out of 3 Ancient Weapons. Buggy's informant, Blackbeard secret man, who is this guy ?](https://preview.redd.it/k28rk97jlela1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9bd46c509c473afb24b28ee61ca04abffe82c6ec)\n\n[And there's Kuma. He shows up in almost every chapter. He was rescued from Marygeoise, then fled Kamabakka Queendom to achieve whatsoever. His flashback is soon to be unravel](https://preview.redd.it/jfxanxfmlela1.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2655bff87371c2f3df3e9d7760050f20afcc1e47)\n\n[Vegapunk is now imprisoned with many CP-XX members. He seems more mischievous than ever](https://preview.redd.it/i588ujnnlela1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b5719fc9b23e56efb8a86e5d70805f8acfa2302)\n\n# IV. Long forgotten foreshadowing\n\nWith all of this in mind, I'm sure none of you forgot what we are also facing in a (not so distant ?) future.\n\n[There's of course the Gran Fleet incident. Not to mention the war called by Whitebeard when he died \\\\\" And someday,bearing the weight of all these generations, a man will appear to challenge this world... Sengoku,you people of the World Government are living in fear of that great battle that will someday engulf the entire world... Though it has nothing to do with me...

The world will be turned upside down!\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/mccnpbqplela1.jpg?width=568&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a85add50c088d47062e8095648e2d07718fd086)\n\n[And our beloved Enel ruling on the moon. May he come back on earth one day](https://preview.redd.it/twrnmxcrlela1.jpg?width=660&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5aadc2d1d635d1e50223146e1dedd3bd31aae017)\n\n[Arlong's sister Prophecy. Is luffy going to destroy FH island or is he going to hand over his straw hat ? Do we had other straw hats in the world ? \\(e.g Imu and his giant frozen straw hat\\). Who knows](https://preview.redd.it/49ygmdrslela1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ea7c39f6b330e80cc57ae80816e0311bf39a7471)\n\nHere it is.\n\nWhat a thrill\n\nLet me know if I forgot someone / something ? And please share your views on the future of One Piece, giving the number of actors at play !\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr:** Kid is Shanks's kid; Blackbeard will imprison Law along with Pudding and Koby, leading to Impel Down 2.0; Kidd will challenge Shanks with a Davy Back Fight; Enel will come back, Foxy will come back, Robin is luffy's sister; Buggy is assembling the biggest fleet ever seen in the series; Saint Jaygarcia is Lucci's father; BigMom is not dead and will land in Elbaf, turning into sweet bigmom again; luffy's dream is to throw the biggest banquet ever; the One Piece is not the destruction of the RedLine; One Piece film RED is worth 1/10 and I'm being nice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr, tl;dr:** throwing some of the best theories I've seen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks to those who read until  there",

        "text": "TO BE VERY CLEAR, I AM CURRENTLY ON EPISODE 102something. I HAVE NOT REACHED THE BIG GEAR 5 REVEAL. I have seen pictures and read small bits of info, so it has been a bit spoiled for me (but I still know very little). So if what I gather is true, and the whole rubber thing is simply like… a weird placebo concept, I haven’t learned it yet. I’m doing this post without that knowledge.\n\nI began watching one piece in June of last year, and I was quickly hooked. The main reason for this was Luffy. It only took an arc or two for me to instantly fall in love with his character, and his powers. When I first started, to me, he was a goofy, loud guy who did and said whatever he wanted, we thought thinking, and he had a perfect ability to go along with it. \n\nThen of course, I began realizing as we entered the grand line just how well done one piece really was. I started paying attention to the story and lore a bit more, but I was still really in it to see Luffy and the rest of the straw hats beat some ass. I’ll admit it was sometimes a tad difficult for me to stay interested when Luffy was loosing, because I felt like it was just delaying by the inevitable. \n\nI sometimes felt a bit frustrated during times when Luffy or the straw hats where struggling during big fights, especially luffy, because it seemed to me that they weren’t using their abilities as practically as they could be. As someone who loved luffys power, I found myself sometimes thinking “bruh, you can stretch him every part of your body, so you are you just running when you could pull yourself along?” That type of thing. \n\nThen I reached timeskip, and with the introduction of haki, I found myself starting to feel disappointed. Throughout fish man and punk hazard, it felt more and more like Luffy was underutilizing the power of rubber to an absurd degree. I was hoping that post timeskip, Luffy would not only have haki, but also have come up with new, more structured and intricate ways of using his rubber body to move and fight. Maybe, a technique that allowed him to intercept projectiles and slingshot them back at opponents with accuracy and speed? Twisting his limbs into compressed shapes, and then releasing them for a blow even more powerful than his bungee like attacks? (I know about g4 Kong techniques), maybe new, absurdly fast methods of moving by using his stretching limbs? Utilizing g3 inflating for more things? Idk. I was just super hopeful\n\ninstead, Luffy uses his rubber power even less. He just mostly does simple extending punches and kicks, a shit ton of g3 and haki, plenty of armament haki, and his default, basic moves he has had since east blue. G4 is sick, but I find it really frustrating that it seems like g4 is the only way Luffy can actually win a meaningful fight anymore, and because of that, he doesn’t bother trying to be creative with his normal form.  Aren’t there so many sick moves oda could come up with, that actually utilize the fact that Luffy is made of rubber? I’m tired of seeing the power of the limb extender and giant fist fruit (3+ zoan transformations included) \n\nIdk am I just dumb",

I wouldn't think he drew that for no reason. Also I don't believe that just a chokehold would be enough to maker her bleed from the mouth.\nThis feels like Oda drew a whole fight and then took out all the pages up until this moment. It's kind of disappointing that he doesn't just give Hancock a bit more justice and gives her a few more pages of screen time.\n\nI hope the anime adds more to this. What do you think?",

The last contest is running, and this final round is Sanji but he too loose\n* Loki used tricks to win, however Usopp notices and then challenges Loki to a one-on-one fight\n* Kuzan arrives in Elbaf along with a couple of other Blackbeard pirates. His arrival brings fimbulwinter (an awakening ability)\n* Loki and Usopp stop their dual as Elbaf is cold and covered in a snowstorm\n* Straw hats learn of a prophecy from the giants about a coming great war: 'Ragnarok' and that they've been preparing for it when it arrives\n* Lola arrives in Loki's castle, however, it's Caterina Devon who used her DF to imitate her (they got this info from Pudding)\n* She seduces Loki and persuades him into giving her a copy of the road poneglyph \n* Nami realises that she's a fake and attacks her\n* Catarina Devon then transforms into Miss Bakin and manipulates Weevil\n* Weevil attacks the Straw hats - he is as strong as Whitebeard\n* Kuzan joins in, Robin asks Kuzan why he's allied with Blackbeard and he responds that he wants to learn of the void century and the WG's secrets, Robin says to ally with them but Kuzan replies that he's not a pirate and betrayal is not his character\n* Loki realising he's been tricked orders the giants to support the Straw hats\n* Usopp uses one of his techniques which reverts Catarina back to her usual form.\n* Weevil realises he's been tricked too\n* Kuzan and Catarina escape\n* Loki befriends Usopp as they're quite similar in personality, Loki gives them a copy of the road poneglyph\n* Robin reads all 4 ponegylphs and they head for Raftel",

        "text": "We are on break, so...\n\nLet’s reverse-engineer a very complicated Marineford Arc. Instead of predicting the future, I’m going to predict the past. Why Oda wrote Marineford that way? This may give hints about the upcoming endgame. \n\nThis is 100% guesswork based on how I interpret the manga. I will miss many things, feel free to “umm… actually” in the comment, I’ll automatically assume you are right, but don’t get angry, please.\n\n**PART ONE: Manga Was Always Going to Be Divided in Half**\n\nOne Piece entire saga being divided in half was probably planned very early, when it clearly showed that Grand Line was divided by Red Line in chapter 22. If Straw Hat kept going straight on the grand line, eventually they will reach that landlocked halfway point. \n\nOda didn’t have to design grand line this way, but he did. Going under it or on top of it, may not have been determined in chapter 22, but they will have to cross it somehow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img s6o8smfercla1...*\n\nWhat will happen in the second half? For Shonen manga, halfway point has standard tropes. Time Skip is obvious. Some series even changed genre (like Dragon Ball) \n\nSo, even earlier on, I think we could have guessed that at that halfway point, **Luffy will battle the** **~~World Government~~**  **someone and lose big.** \n\nLet’s get one thing out of the way. Naruto did a 2 year time skip a couple of years before One Piece. \n\nDid Oda copied? More than likely NOT. But, my theory is: **Shonen Jump editors insist** Oda does the same thing. \n\nShonen Jump editors looked at things in terms of business. And mangaka, no matter how successful, must listen to them to a degree. Toriyama Akira infamously still has to concede to his editor during Cell saga, even though his Freeza Saga allowed Shonen Jump to just print money.\n\n*(side note: I have tremendous respect for DBZ’s editor and Toriyama Akira’s pain in the butt editor, Torishima-san. Unfortunately for One Piece fan, he was probably famous for telling Oda One Piece will never be popular. Oda even asked him to apologize afterwards. But if you looked at Torishima’s contribution to Arale and Dragon Ball, that guy was a genius)*\n\n2 years time skip is good for business. We will get characters redesign (except Fairy Tail), new special moves, updates to all villain and side characters, surprising revelations about events during timeskip, as well as a road map to the end of the series.\n\n**What was the impact of Luffy losing?**\n\nOne Piece was a manga that debuted during a period where “main character is a cool badass right from the start” phase of Shonen Jump. Kenshin, Yami Yugi, Luffy. They are unique in that unlike Goku and Naruto, they do not train for the readers to see. \n\n[Except Zoro](https://preview.redd.it/ylr85wzo6dla1.png?width=1085&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0a121b7f7c0fb402ebb054590da4ea719c634f14)\n\nSo in early arcs, Luffy was stronger than most characters he met on any island he set foot on, right up until his first battle with Crocodile. And even after he beat Lucci, we never see him train.\n\nAs Straw hat approached Red Line, Luffy became even more powerful, but...\n\n*(I wrote this in my other post: Luffy does not train like other people until he met Reyleigh. He mimicked what he saw. All of his moves came from something he witnessed. Like how the sea train inspired gear second, and all his post-time skip moves are animal themed because he trained on that island. And yes, I do think Luffy saw a UFO),* \n\n... as he got stronger, the gap between him and the enemies on each of the islands became wider and wider. Starting with Aokiji, Kuma, Pacifista (which took all combined effort from the crew to take down 1), Kizaru, Sentomaru and Magellan. **Enemies he cannot beat just kept on coming.** I think it’s safe to say that this was always the plan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3eb9xt2x5dla1.png?width=1438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cb39366db138156fdda20de7504401d60cb4c941\n\nOda did say this about when Mihawk showed up at Baratie, along the line of, “it makes sense for someone of that caliber to make his debut at that time.” (paraphrasing). So I think that’s always been his logic. The closer you are to the Red Line, the stronger enemies you will meet because it makes sense for them to show up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[It just made sense for him to show up](https://preview.redd.it/2p4ilyb9scla1.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=08eed181c59f0043950832f9a2b52fa33eb32ab9)\n\n**PART TWO: What Was Originally Supposed to be Luffy’s Mission at Red Line?** \n\nNow we know that Red Line has Mary Geoise and Marineford nearby. Let say that was the plan from the beginning, even at the early stage of drafting One Piece,  There was no way Luffy and his friends were just going to pass by the main Marine Headquarters without saying hi, right?\n\nBut do you think during the early draft there was there actually going to be an arc where the log pose forced the Straw Hats to go into Marine Headquarters? \n\nIn hindsight, it’s always make sense that Luffy was going to have to go in there to get something.  Since Luffy do not care about material things that much, (let's face it, a lot of us were surprised Luffy cared about Ace’s Devil Fruit at Dressrosa), it was obvious he was going to rescue somebody, a human being.\n\nAnd more importantly, he will fail to rescue this person. \n\nLike, was someone always going to die? Naruto’s big loss that initiated a 2 years time skip didn’t result in anybody’s death, just Sasuke succeed in leaving the village. \n\nBut I will say yes. And not only just yes, but also that it was going to be one of the Straw Hat members that get executed. I have my theory about who it was originally going to be, but it’s not relevant right now.\n\nOda had to make sure that the failure of saving this nakama will be devastating for Luffy. \n\nBut, since this is Shonen, and all characters have fan clubs (especially the one I thought was considered to be the one who will die), a sacrificial lamb was created to be the one to die in this person’s place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"This war is so stupid, how come no one die? ... Wait! Not Neiji!\\\\\" - Naruto readers 2013](https://preview.redd.it/etl1ce9rtcla1.png?width=447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=894fb99a929f640603eb53c6f612ac9577dfe733)\n\n**PART THREE: Ace, the man between two beards.**\n\nOda did say that he knows the fate of a character as soon as he debuts them. He said this specifically when talking about Ace. So Ace was created to die. \n\nHis death was going to mark the halfway point to make Luffy realize that he will have to get stronger and be better to keep his nakama safe in this cruel world.\n\nNow, Ace's debut was very interesting. He was debuted at the start of Alabasta Arc, almost totally unrelated to the arc. He mentioned the two beards that control his destiny. The man who is his savior, at the time closest to being a pirate king after Roger, Whitebeard. And the man he was hunting, Blackbeard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pxhtgs8vcla1.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2005c9170c156e8688cf25418a5b53b8a39fa68\n\nBlackbeard himself was introduced in the previous arc, a while before Ace. Luffy and Sanji also talked about his uniqueness surprisingly a lot. It was as if Oda just created a character and was too excited about it and had to put a bit of an info dump in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axo5u8wkvcla1.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=669c3d0717de5e169da2c9649fcc82f2f91eb482\n\nOda said he was very careful about Blackbeard crew’s design. Because they are the most ‘pirates’ out of all the pirate of the manga. Something to think about.\n\nThe two beards of opposite color are definitely not accident. Oda designed color-coded characters all the time. The admirals for example. They were designed and named to be opposite, and I do think all three were created together. White Beard is the current strongest power, and after halfway point, Blackbeard will replace him, when the whole world enter a darker age.\n\nNot only that…. I think, like Whitebeard was Ace's savior, Blackbeard was designed to be Ace’s killer.\n\nNow, yes, Ace’s killer is Akainu. But since Ace’s death, I don’t know anybody, both inside and outside of the manga, who was that mad at Akainu. (I could be wrong, I only observe few fan groups and talk among my friends) He did what he was suppose to do.\n\nAfter the war, White beard’s former crew had a revenge war against Blackbeard, not World Government. It will be interesting to see how Luffy will react when he sees Akainu again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qsfpamyvcla1.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f72d798501d94f8525c7ad17122eba4ebe5b957a\n\nMy feeling is that Blackbeard was always designed to be the killer of Ace, and World Government was just his murder weapon.\n\nIt’s strange isn’t it, that a man who was destined to be killed by the marines, his introduction have him being unrelated to the marines at all. Marines weren’t even hunting Ace at the time.\n\nI think I know why.\n\n**PART FOUR: Making the World Government and Marines evil**\n\nOne thing that I found so fascinating is that, for all those long arcs that lead up to Water 7, most marines we met were admirable. They are honorable and likable. Characters like Axe-hand Morgan and Nezumi seem to be the outlier. Marines that didn’t act like how marines are supposed to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5ll299fwcla1.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=39e8ff1af3fa74a9e998167632821565ddecc72e\n\nAnd even the truly bad ones, like Nezumi, they weren’t a serious threat. Even Smoker, the strongest marine featured in the manga up until that point, became a comic relief during Crocodile arc.\n\nAce himself was even given a cover story playing around with marines. Knowing his fate now and re-reading all that was so ironic. Ace didn’t think he was on the Marines’ radar at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fun shenanigans with people who will one day kill him](https://preview.redd.it/fnphkd6e9dla1.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6bdb9c1136032f0723b6db34a93df25e133c437e)\n\nThe first sign that Marine and World Government was truly evil, and not just a force that let evil slide like Nezumi and Crocodile, started with a single picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqiah3gyxcla1.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eb5f41739354a69b0b8af50ff4da75450700385e\n\nAnd that happened after Ace’s introduction. Sure, Robin debuted long before that, and you could say that Robin was always meant to be the key that lead Straw Hat to declare war against the marines and World Government later, but… I don’t know. I feel like…\n\nI feel like if One Piece wasn’t always going to turn out like this, if Enies Lobby and Marineford was going to happen that way since the beginning,  I think Oda would have gone back and made World Government more evil from the start. You would get flashback of WG slaughtering kids from the start of the manga. \n\nThey were always there but they were very tame. **All the big bad were pirates, with some lacky being corrupted marines.** \n\nOne Piece’s theme of freedom vs justice that people, including me, love to theorize about, **came so late.** Before that, all the villains had been pirates. \n\nIf anything, marines were evil for not being thorough enough. Not being strong enough. Not being tough enough on pirates.\n\nI think it crossed Oda’s mind that marines was always going to be not that strong, and would rely on Shichibukai to defend it. And that the halfway point would be Whitebeard and Luffy going to rescue Ace, and the main force preventing that was the Shichibukai called up by them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxmzmfrrycla1.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=da3f8e89fd2467386ce20a8169c965afd181b107\n\nThe end result however was much different. The admirals pretty much do most of the heavy lifting. Was that always going to be the case? In hindsight, yeah, marines was going to have some powerful people working for them. But the admirals we got made Shichibukai look like amateurs.\n\nI don’t know how long they planned to feature the admirals. I feel like if Oda thought about them before, they would have debuted sooner. I actually think someone like Kizaru could have appeared in that meeting where Doflamingo and Kuma debut. \n\nIn any case, I think the admirals were created to add marines’ badassery to the war. They are the ‘captain’ of the WG, countering the enormous power of Whitebeard, which exceeds Shichibukai. And we started with Aokiji, whose power… literally opposite Ace's.\n\nEven though as soon as Aokiji was debut, we get a mention of Kizaru and Akainu right away, I also think that Oda considered an Ice power marinem or even an Ice power Shichibukai, as the big boss at one point. Reason being that the entire Marineford War was designed around Ice Power. I'll get into more detail in a bit.\n\nI think from this point, all the characters that appeared after Alabasta were designed to participate in the war. By the time Oda wrote Water-7, we already teased **Impel Down**. Robin was not going to go there, but Ace will. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19om9knq4dla1.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=416713c69868e02fd2439c63107f991f3b3389e5\n\nAt that point, I think Oda had already decided that 4 arcs later, Luffy was going to ‘go to hell and back’ for his brother.\n\n**PART FIVE: Separating the Straw Hat, What if Oda Didn’t?**\n\nLet’s pretend that Marineford was going to be a typical One Piece arc. Like Skypiea, Dressrosa, Fishman Island, etc. How will it follow the formula?\n\nSo this is how it would go, in my opinion of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Luffy met Camie and Hatchan and they all went to Sabaody.\n* Camie got kidnapped. Fishmen told **Jinbei** that Straw Hat kidnapped her.\n* Jinbei hunted down Luffy and the two fight.\n* Luffy punched Celestial Dragon, earning Jinbei’s respect.\n* News of Ace execution came up, and Jinbei revealed to be Ace’s friend.\n* Jinbei helped Luffy sneak into Marineford using secret underwater passageway\n* Straw Hat divided and conquer (as they always do). Sanji pretended to be a Marine because no one know what he looks like.\n* Straw Hat successfully located Ace, but Ace won’t leave, saying Luffy would never get away, and that he should die to stop the war.\n* Whitebeard came, all hell broke lose, Straw Hat joined the war.\n* Luffy successfully rescued Ace… however, Ace died protecting Luffy.\n* Straw Hat could not escape. Kuma sent all the Straw Hat to separate faraway locations, saving them from the Marine’s wrath.\n\nThis would be the most direct and simplest form the Marineford arc would take, if it was a normal One Piece arc. And I wouldn’t be surprised if this was Oda’s first draft in his head as Alabasta chapters were being released. \n\nSo why wouldn’t that work? Well… I have one theory.\n\nIt involved Zoro. \n\nI think that, early on, may be even earlier than when Oda created Ace, Oda had plans for how strong the Straw Hat was going to be after Red Line.\n\nFrom our perspective, you might think it’s Luffy’s ability to control his conqueror’s haki, or him one punched a Pacifista. But to me, the best gauge of how far the Straw Hat had come, was this:\n\nZoro was able to cut an entire ship with a single swing of his sword. Just like Mihawk did back in Baratie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Just a note: I found this on a Neogaf message board \\(which credit a subreddit\\), thanks to whoever made this so I don't have to.](https://preview.redd.it/gl4a6slqzcla1.png?width=1423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12942a2ff1359122bffc44321d44c8beee2d9922)\n\nAnd Mihawk was always going to be the one who taught Zoro.\n\nWhy did I say this? Where did this come from?\n\nAgain, I was trying to look at how Oda designed the plot that we got, subconsciously.  \n\n\\- Zoro was the first person Kuma sent away. \n\nAnd when it was decided that the Straw Hats were going to train instead of reunite, it ended with Zoro asking Mihawk to train him.\n\nMihawk cutting a ship with his sword has always been the standard of where the top in the world was. Sure, we saw Shank used conqueror’s haki as early as the first chapter, and Shank was revealed to be Mihawk’s rival soon after. But, we didn’t know Shank was one of the strongest person in the world until much later. Other strong people like Dragon did display his power, but not in the way Mihawk did. \n\nNow, after the timeskip, **Zoro could do the move that the best in the world did several chapters ago.** That was the biggest indication of how far he, and the manga, has come.\n\nSo why Zoro being trained by Mihawk such an important thing, make Kuma sending Straw Hat away during the war didn’t work? Well, Mihawk was at the war. It would be weird for Zoro to fly to Mihawk and had to wait there until Mihawk showed up. \n\nOda could have just not had Mihawk join the war? Oh, but he has to. Shichibukai's reunion at the war is a HUGE requirement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART SIX: (Original) Shinchibukai Reunion**\n\nIt is the law of shonen manga: if characters are part of a set, you will see them in the same place. I think it was set since the beginning that all of the Shichibukai will be at the halfway point, even the one that Luffy hadn’t defeated yet like Doflamingo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmumdutt0dla1.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2387213a22540257edce67bfe543db8f715873f4\n\nAnd as I said before, they were going to be the main force countering Whitebeard, long before Oda realized that he should create the Admirals, which ended up pulling the most weight at the war.\n\nThis, of course, led to a question: how to get all the Shichibukai at the war?\n\nWhen Marineford was designed in its early stage, when Ace just showed up, there were only three Shichibukai that ‘appeared’. Mihawk, Jibei (mentioned), and Crocodile, who was about to get the beating of his life by Luffy.\n\nAt the end of the arc, two more showed up: Doflamingo and Kuma. I think the fact that these two showed up to that weird little meeting with Sengoku was just to show that these Shichibukai in particular, are the government’s tool. \n\nThe fact that the others did not show up was also a statement. Hancock not showing up made sense the most. But, in hindsight, I thought Moria (then again, he was probably just lazy), and especially Jinbei, should have. Jinbei was a gentleman, and his being Shichibukai was part of his campaign to keep Fishman Island safe. \n\nI want to be clear, I am not being hard on Oda, I understand he probably hadn’t yet designed Moria and Jinbei at that point, I was just pointing out which characters became the version we know now at which point in time. **Remember, Jinbei was originally supposed to be a villain.**\n\nLuffy detour at Impel Down made sense. Impel Down was my favorite arc, yet its design make no sense. Luffy went to get Ace, got stuck, then come back out without Ace. What was the point? The point was the collect all the remaining Shichibukai and bring them to the war. But the main one? Crocodile.\n\nCrocodile was in prison. How was he going to join the war? Luffy had to go get Crocodile. \n\n[No thanks, I'm not going to escape. I'm waiting for Luff... I mean, I just love prison food so much.](https://preview.redd.it/fap59v501dla1.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=337278cd2e6e0e7cbde8a4bdf7d79344368c3b55)\n\nJinbei was a conundrum. He will join the war on our side, but how? Jinbei was just going to show up with Whitebeard? \n\nIt didn’t make sense too much for Jinbei to suddenly ‘act out’ and ended up in Impel Down with Ace. If there was anything I was going to criticize about the masterful Marineford arc, it’s that Buggy and Jinbei were sent to Impel Down a bit late. Jinbei was way too smart for that. He could have used the fact that Sengoku trusted him to help Ace later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"Why would he want to rescue his friend and side with the man that brought peace to Fishman Island? Doesn't make any sense!\\\\\" - Sengoku the strategist](https://preview.redd.it/ba53wr504dla1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=263b15c460bc75048ef210b9eae214b4ed08f9c8)\n\nAnyway, a lot of the players were placed at Impel Down at the same time. Three Shichibukai to be exact: Hancock, Jinbei and Crocodile (not counting the not-Shichibukai, Blackbeard). Hancock was going to the war on a different ship of course, but Luffy was the one who ‘got’ her to go in the first place as well.\n\nSo literally, Luffy’s detour was basically a Shichibukai’s carpool. It was the only way for Crocodile to join the war.\n\n**PART SEVEN: Designing the War Strategy: Earthquake and ice**\n\nThe entire war featured some satisfying set pieces, but in order to break it down, you sort of have to put away your admiration and step back to look at the big picture. \n\nAs I was doing that, it was clear to me that the impressive devil fruit usage was design for the start of the war: specifically the double Tsunami.\n\nI will even say that two big things that shaped the entire manga, might have originated in trying to get the double tsunami to work. This is pure speculation of course, but I would not be surprised if it’s true.\n\nAokiji’s ice devil fruit. And the design of Marineford itself. All were designed in order to make the Tsunami scene work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y41tskqd3dla1.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dc36a51f81ba436066b09025a8a736b232356ed2\n\nOda loved to include Tsunami in One Piece. The biggest one started was Aqualuna Water 7. And while Water-7/Enies Lobby will always be my favorite arc of any shonen manga ever, I think a lot of the way it was designed seemed to be a trial run for what Oda had in mind for Marineford. Friend getting kidnapped. Storming a government building. Finding keys. Tsunami. I will even go as far as saying Rob Lucci was designed as Aokiji’s-lite. He looks kinda like younger version of Aokiji. I thought they were related at first.\n\nAnyway, I think the idea of Whitebeard causing a double Tsunami, and Aokiji freezing it was **the first thing Oda thought about when designing the war.** \n\nI will go as far as saying Aokiji has ice power because of this. And this is also why Marineford… is a separate island and not attached to Red Line. It would have made more sense and wouldn’t leave the back of it vulnerable to attack from the sea. But it was design this way for double tsunami coming from both side to work.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/houljb3l1dla1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ba16ea0358543f0ff415f6815e27ac47abe93825\n\nOutside of that initial creation of the double Tsunami, Whitebeard earthquake power was kind of underused for the rest of the war. Sure he made John Giant lost his balance. But his big attack hurt his allies too. And then most of the time, it just felt like a very strong regular attack. \n\nThe freezing of the double tsunami then led to the most ingenious plot design of the war. Luffy and the Impel Down escapees fell down from the sky.\n\nBut there was a problem. The sea was frozen. I do think the war was going to be fought on ice as soon as frozen double tsunami was decided on. But then, someone had to create a big hole on the ice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I guess the ice looked kinda like a diamond?](https://preview.redd.it/63iyi4rq2dla1.png?width=1431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ef7343f620cd90fb02492366034d5c2e70acf6c8)\n\nAfter the war began, then it became an American football match. Luffy was the quarterback with the ball and the marines he met along the way played defense. This was like an extension of Impel Down where Luffy just ran into previous characters.\n\nAnd then there’s the finale. Yes, I do think Inazuma’s power was designed for the moment. Originally they were supposed to be a crab zoan, if I remember correctly.\n\nAs far as Mr. 3 fake key was concerned, another ingenious moment from Oda, and I think that when Oda designed Impel Down, he knew Luffy was going to meet his old enemies like Buggy, Bonchan, and Crocodile. **This is a common trope of heroes going to hell to get something, dating back to Greek mythology.**\n\nBuggy and Bonchan had a role, but Mr. 3, how was he going to be important? Key. He was always the key guy. Having him being someone who ended up making the key that freed Ace makes sense. \n\nBut, while reading the chapters as it was released, several people correctly guessed that Mr. 3 replaced one of the guards a few chapters before it was revealed. So I guess it wasn’t such a wild idea?\n\nI do not know why I wrote this. I guess I just wanted to revisit the Marineford arc from a critical point of view. Reading that arc as the chapters were released was a great experience, and reverse-engineering the arc was enjoyable. Thanks for reading.",

It’s through these two chapters that I finally see a nearly complete picture, one painted in contrasting colors between probably the two main narrative pillars of this arc, Big Mom and Sanji. Their story tackles the same themes from different perspectives, which brought together raise each other that much more by giving greater significance to both the events and persons that shaped up their lives, as well as the nature of the characters themselves, and how what they were born with impacted their upbringing.\n\nI will start this by saying that I absolutely love Big Mom’s flashback, and that Oda managed in just two chapters to make WCI as a whole a much better, more complete arc for me. It’s through these two chapters that I finally see a nearly complete picture, one painted in contrasting colors between probably the two main narrative pillars of this arc, Big Mom and Sanji. Their story tackles the same themes from different perspectives, which brought together raise each other that much more by giving greater significance to both the events and persons that shaped up their lives, as well as the nature of the characters themselves, and how what they were born with impacted their upbringing.\n\nLet’s first discuss the nature of these characters, what they were born with. In terms of personality both are presented as kind hearted children, who empathize with others and wish to help others out. Big Mom goes out of her way to make peace between animals, or help out the other children, while Sanji prepares food for small animals, and shows joy at their satisfaction.  \n\n\nHowever, a factor that greatly changes their early years is their **Strength**. Big Mom was born too strong for those around her and that’s a reason for dissatisfaction and harm towards them, while Sanji on the other hand was born “too weak”. It goes further than this though, Big Mom was naturally born too strong, a “natural born destroyer”, while Sanji was born “just” a normal person, and thus too weak for the aspirations of his father who was trying to artificially create a “destroyer” akin to Big Mom.  \n\n\nTheir strength pushes them away from their family and the place of their birth, having them discarded as misfits who can’t adapt and match the expectations of those around them.  \n\n\nSomething else that was a big part of their lives, starting from their early years, and ended up greatly shaping up the persons that they are today is **Food**. As mentioned earlier, Sanji used to cook for the small animals that took refuge in his surroundings. He also prepared food for his sick mother, who’s praise encouraged him further and continued to push him on this path of being a provider.  \n\n\nBecause that’s what Sanji is, and this is where we see the second contrasting aspect between him and Big Mom when it comes to the same theme. While Sanji is a “**Provider**”, Big Mom is a “**Consumer**”. A basic need of Big Mom which overrides her good intentions is that to consume, while a basic need for Sanji is to provide to others. Both find satisfaction at their core in this, and it’s something they can’t help themselves from doing. This is also something that once again leads to them losing their families. Sanji’s need to provide for others through his cooking goes against his father’s principles as Royalty, while Big Mom’s need to consume leads to the tragic event of her literally eating everything dear to her, the family that provided her with the happiest day of her life for her birthday.  \n\n\nAnother interesting fact is that both Big Mom and Sanji experience starvation at a young age, as a huge event that ends up changing the rest of their life. Both are saved from the repercussions of that event by their parent figures, and it leads to them following those parent figures to a new found home. For Sanji it’s the Baratie, and for Big Mom it appears to be the WCI as the island of the Lamb’s House relocation, but this is speculative from my part at the point of writing this post.  \n\n\nTheir lives continue to greatly revolve around food and their nature as a “Provider” and a “Consumer”, with Sanji becoming a Chef and Big Mom becoming a Yonko which demands food as price for her protection, and constantly looks forward to her never ending stream of consumption focused tea parties. Even the making of her crew follows the tendency of a consumer, with her using her children to “eat up” other families and incorporate them into her own, using them as their “life and blood”, as Perospero told Judge at the current Tea Party. They are just “cows”, just “products” for Big Mom that she can consume for her benefit. Same with the residents of WCI, who are demanded to give away portions of their souls, which ends up being consumed for the purpose of animating WCI with Big Mom’s soul abilities.  \n\n\nNow the latest aspect is their **Parenting**. I already addressed part of this in the “Strength” and “Food” sections because those were significant aspects that influenced this one as well, so I will try not to repeat too much of what I’ve already stated. As I said earlier, Sanji’s father created him for the purpose of using him as a superhuman weapon. He wanted to model Sanji according to his needs, and expectations as a descendant of a royal bloodline, and the fact that Sanji did not match those needs and expecations made Judge give up on him. In Big Mom’s case, her natural parents are flashed out a lost less, but from what is shown, they have no exceptional expectations from her, and just wish a normal life from their child. However, we can see their expectations as just as hard for Big Mom to meet because of how far from normal she was since birth. One could argue that their hand was forced and they had no choice but to abandon her to a certain extent, but I’m not going to go into the moral aspects of their choice, and just state it as it happened. Just like Sanji, Big Mom was abandoned because she did not match the needs and expectations of her natural parents. Something else that we can conclude is that in spite of the efforts of their natural parents, they ended up living lives that match the nature they were born with, one that I’ve discussed earlier when I labeled them as a “Provider” and a “Consumer”.  \n\n\nThe persons that did manage to actually influence them a lot more than their natural parents though are their parent figures. **Zeff** and **Carmel** both played a huge role in their upbringing, and end up pushing them on a path that matches their nature. Obviously the two figures contrast in their own nature, with the well intentioned Zeff as the one who makes sacrifices for Sanji’s sake and earnestly puts him on that path, while the ill intentioned Carmel raises Big Mom for her own sake, and Big Mom is pushed on a path that’s build on the noble aspirations that Carmel promotes, but does not believe in.  \n\n\nAs a result of that, Big Mom’s vision and the manner in which she conducts herself on that path is twisted and ends up as a monstrous parody of those noble ideals, while Sanji’s path stays true to Zeff’s ideals, and is one that ends up bringing happiness to himself and to those around him. Sanji ends up being loved and appreciated. He’s needed by his friends who become a second family to him and his captain goes as far as to state that he would not be able to achieve his dream without Sanji’s help, while laying down his own life to help Sanji out and get him back on his side. Meanwhile, Big Mom is only keeping her family, blood of her own together through fear. They end up valuing their own life more than hers and her wishes and aspirations, and many are unhappy with Big Mom’s actions and what they are forced to do for her sake.  \n\n\nSo at the end of the day, the two characters end up staying true to their nature when it comes to the relationship they build with others as well. The “Consumer” ends up taking happiness from others, while the “Provider” gives it to them.\n\nnot only did carmel have a big role for big mom but so did streusen just like how both sora and zeff had a role with sanji and for big mom carmel has a bit of both sora and zeff as stated above streusen plays more on zeff\n\nyou could also compare big mom with carmel to sanji with sora and big mom with streusen  to sanji with zeff.\n\nboth big mom and sanji  both had mother figures who they loved very much but while carmel was faking it sora was genuine and sora has shown to love everything sanji did and was willing to eat sanjis bad food he made for her with a smile on her face because of it was his attempt to show affection and to make him happy for she loved him   and how she cried at sanji saying have a nice day while carmels smiles were to keep up her act   and because she wanted to profit off of linlin  using linlin for her own happiness\n\n both streussen and zeff were pirate chefs  who acted as father figures   to big mom and sanji respectively and talked about dreams whie streussen had a df that made it so he wouldnt starve (and if it wasnt for him big mom would have starved) and its because of zeff that sanji didnt starve but while zeff made a sacrifice  \nwhere he went without eating and had to cut off his own leg streussen had a df to feed linlin  \n\n\nStreusen has manipulated and used Linlin however he pleased, taking advantage of her confusion over her vanishing benefactor and friends and the fact that she was 6, thus very influenceable and easy to manipulate and brainwash while zeff was always genuine  in his attitude to sanji while  he was strict/rough with him and hide his affection while being  a bit gruff while streusen went to linlin in order to use her for his own needs/fun zeff went to sanji to help him  and starved so sanji wouldnt",
