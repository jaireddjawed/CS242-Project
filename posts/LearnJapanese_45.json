I figure that the item I'm holding is already established, so I wouldn't want to use \"これが嫌いです。\" because that puts emphasis on これ, which I don't need to emphasis because we already both know what that is. So I'm thinking it would be better to say \"これは嫌いです。\" to put the emphasis on me not liking the thing, because that's the part that was previously not established.  \n\n\nAm I understanding how は and が work properly? Is this one of those things that's a little more nuanced than a black and white rule? I just want to make sure I'm not misunderstanding how I should be using は and が.  \n\n\nThanks so much and sorry if this is a bad post or in the wrong place!",

I know one of the down variants mean to lower and to go down, and the up variants mean to raise and to rise. But I can not for the life of me remember which one is rise and raise or to go down or lower.\n\nAre there any useful tips/rules to remember the difference between these two? Since I think with some context I would be able to remember better. Sorry if this kind of question already has been posted already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: Thanks everyone for the replies!

I have recently finished RTK1 and I also did Genki 1&amp;2 some time ago, which I will review very soon. So lets just act like I got RTK 1, Genki 1 amd Genki 2 down.\nNow I thought I would just go on to do RTK2, but after looking in it and trying to find out how people used it (which started this whole problem) I now discovered that it's pretty useless apparently.\nNow I'm here in Japan, I can recognize almost all Kanji, but I can't read Jack. \nSo how do I continue? I found a plethora on answers already, but they always covered somewhat different situations.\nMost people said that now I just learn vocab and learn to read the Kanji that way. I heard about the Core 6k and 10k decks. Is that still the current recommended way to go? I just looked them up on Anki and there were actually no core 6k decks and the 10k that was talked about seems to be gone as well.\nI know the Genki vocab already of course, but not with Kanji. Should I relearn those first, with Kanji?\n\nI also own Tobira, which I wanted to do next, but since it seems like I have to be able to read Kanji first, I cant do that yet.\n\nSo basically, with the stuff under my belt, that I have, how do I go on to read Kanji? Is Kanji in Context appropriate now?\n\n\nTL;DR: RTK1, Genki 1&amp;2 done, in Japan for a year, learned RTK2 is useless, which threw me out of the curve, what to do now?",

I want to learn Hiragana as well, but i also want to share a funny idea and ask if it's doable (question is addressed to people who learned japanese on higher level).   \n\n\nTry to imagine if i learned to read fluently both in Katakana and Hiragana, then one day traveled to Japan with my friends and went to japanese karaoke bar and try to sing a song with japanese lyrics even if i don't know what those words mean.   \nDo you think that it sounds  possible? Of course if i went that far i would probably learn basic Japanese to communicate with people, but i just wanted to ask if it sounds realistic to learn read Katakana/Hiragana fluently enough to sing japanese songs in Karaoke bar  ",

It's in a good enough state to distribute.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a lot of time to explain it, but you can look up online on how to install a firefox extension from a file.\n\nYour anki must be opened and have the Ankiconnect addon installed for it to work. \n\nAddon adds two icons next to every meaning of a word on [Tangorin.com](https://Tangorin.com).  \nThe left Icon instantly creates the card based on specified parameters.  \nThe Right icon brings up a submenu to change inputs before adding.   \nOnce you click and add a card, the icon will change to ankis logo and clicking it will bring up that word in the Anki browser.  \nIf the card exists but is suspended, it will prompt you to unsuspend it.   \n\n\nAfter installing go and set up the Addon in the firefox Extension settings menu.  \n\\-  \nDeck Name and Model Name should be easy enough.  \nMax Kanji, because Tangorin often gives uncommon kanji readings as well only returns that number of listed kanji expressions.\n\nBottom line, I recommend setting Max Kanji, Kana, and English to 1/1/3 .\n\nThe first fields should be easy to figure out.  Just type in your fields for the model type you use.  If a field doesnt exist you can create it in your card type to add the extra information.\n\nFull Definition adds the Full English Field (instead of the above limit of 3.\n\nFrequency Field Name adds frequency based on a predetermined list of up to 20000 words.\n\nArticle Count Field will display the number of articles that word appears in on japanese yahoo news.  (max is around 500,000+)  \n\n\nJapanese Sentence Field Name adds the Japanese definition in Japanese\n\nUpdate Existing Cards, if a card exists and you try to add it, it will add the additional information that this addon might provide.\n\nSuspend function will automatically suspend a card once created if its outside of the frequency listed.\n\nAdd Suru to expression will add 「する」to the end of an expression. (Dont recommend)  \nAdd Suru as Suffix will add 「する」to a field named Suffix  \n",

In add of this some books are available on Amazon like Read Real Japanese.\n\nTo be totally sincere in some cases the translation confuse me instead if help cause the translation made is not literal but is \"interpreted\" for transpose the sense to the foreign language. It can be correct for high level but I would like to have a more literal translation for try understand the grammar rule used in that context.\n\nIn any case someone know other parallel text resource like thiese available for free?\n\nThank you",

Lookup can be really fast when the furigana is written right by the side as most people here will know, and I also own a bilingual short story anthology for adults produced especially for similar purposes that I would honestly recommend if not for fear of advertising. \n\nAdditionally, after reading an interesting blog post a while ago I found some interesting comics aimed at adults which obviously use more mature themes and structure (and live-action shows), so it's not a question of simply wishing to be childish so much as wishing use a broad range of materials.\n\n Reading children's material has been interesting and I've been learning a lot, especially with サイボーグクロちゃん, which I have been reading lately and also translating a bit for fun privately since I am working from a digital source and when I was younger always wanted to play at doing that kind of thing (plus, have you seen the only fan translation of it out there? It's awful! Added honorifics where none were present, errors in translating multiple phrases, a definite loss of the oddities of certain manners of speaking by one character...I could go on).\n\nThe problem is, my family saw this, and saw my work. Is reading something aimed at children even worth the mocking? I don't think it's an incredible or life-changing series personally but I just feel really dejected and like my learning is a waste of time. I want to read stories, have conversations, write at least basically, and understand things I never could have without that knowledge, and I want to feel like this is progress but it's difficult when people make jokes referencing the teletubbies and then call you a psycho for being displeased and not in the same extreme manner they were. Does anyone else deal with this problem? Mainly wondering how you all handle it if it comes up.",
