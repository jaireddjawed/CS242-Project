        "text": "Over my past few years on Reddit I've noticed a strong tendency for subreddits to do what /r/hiphopheads does to Kanye West.\n\nOn HHH, Kanye West's music is commonly cited as hip-hop you should listen to to get into the genre at first because his music is pretty accessible and really good. Because the subreddit always has some people who are just getting into the genre, there's almost inevitably discussion about Kanye every day, and the subreddit more or less worships him. People overlook a lot of his (and his music's) flaws and often avoid finding new stuff because of reverence for Yeezy.\n\nI've seen this phenomenon in which a subreddit's \"entry level\" eventually becomes a worshipped, neverending topic of discussion on a bunch of other subreddits:\n\n* On /r/cars it's the Mazda Miata, a cheap roadster that's fun to drive, but also catches on fire and is not suitable for tall people.\n* On /r/malefashionadvice it's the \"MFA Uniform\" the combination of Clark's Desert Boots, a button down, and rolled up dark jeans.\n* On /r/futurology it's Elon Musk. While the guy has great ideas and his companies do a lot of great stuff he also fails to deliver a lot and is not very nice to his workers.\n* On /r/fitness it's like 3 different beginner/intermediate lifting programs. Seriously, every other post there is about breaking through some barrier on one of these programs (NSuns, PPL, Stronglifts,) or how to do some aspect of it?\n\nAre there other examples of this? is this a common effect on Reddit?\n",

        "text": "If this is not an appropriate question for this subreddit I will move it, but I couldn't think of somewhere better.\n\nFirst of all, I realize this a bit subjective, and will reflect some of my own opinions on an ongoing issue regarding the /r/bitcoin reddit.\n\nCompletely made up example: Let's say myself and a few of my friends invented a new operating system called AwesomeOS, and for whatever reason, millions of people started using it. It's completely free, and in the public domain. Let's say I also created a reddit /r/awesomeOS. When people search on the internet for AwesomeOS, they find my subreddit.\n\nNow, a few years later, I decide to sell out. AwesomeOS is still free and in the public domain, but me and my friends are hired by a company that wants to invest in AwesomeOS. Eventually, the company intends to make money off AwesomeOS, by adding some features here and there, and calling it AwesomeOS-2. My friends and I start pushing AwesomeOS-2 on /r/awesomeOS. Our agenda now aligns with our company's agenda - we want users of the original AwesomeOS software to switch to the AwesomeOS-2 software. AwesomeOS-2 is kind of the same thing, and the new features make AwesomeOS-2 a little better, but now the company will make money from AwesomeOS-2.\n\nMeanwhile, part of the AwesomeOS community notices the creators sold out. The community has developed improvements to AwesomeOS as well, and they are just as technically sound as the improvements in AwesomeOS-2, but do not compromise the original plan to be free and open. This part of the community begins to get vocal, and starts calling out the creators on /r/awesomeOS. Let's pretend that I decide not to put up with dissent in my community - so I start censoring /r/awesomeOS. Anyone who talks bad about the creators, the company, or awesomeOS-2 get banned. Sometimes, my own posts are downvoted, so I decide to hide votes on the subreddit. Can't have bad press, after all.\n\nSoon, another community is formed, /r/AOS, controlled by the AwesomeOS community with no sensorship, no hidden votes, and discussion is free and open. But when people search for AwesomeOS, they still primarily find /r/awesomeOS, and what they see and read talks about how great awesomeOS-2 is. Maybe they notice some posts are deleted now and then, and maybe they think it's weird that votes are hidden, but they don't think much of it.\n\nExample over.\n\nSomething seems wrong about the situation I described, but I have a feeling there are no policies or anything to prevent it. As I mentioned above, in my opinion, this is similar to what has happened over at /r/bitcoin (and /r/btc). I will avoid getting into this discussion and stick to the example though.\n\nI also could not think of another real example of this kind of thing happening to compare it with. I mean obviously /r/the_donald has an agenda, but if you see that subreddit you know exactly what you will find - you couldn't mistake it for something other than what it is. /r/trees 'pretends' to be something it is not by having an intentionally misleading name, but there is no agenda there, and one quick look will show you it is not about actual trees. So I had to make up an example to try to illustrate my question.\n\nAlso, after writing this, I realize part of the problem may just be the search engine side of things - perhaps search engines should punish subreddits with high levels of censorship? I feel like that would resolve part of my concern, but I am curious if there is any precedent for something like this on reddit.\n\n(Edited for spelling)",

Among those reasons are a shortage of capable, willing, and hardworking moderators; redditors who don't read the subreddit rules; and redditors who are argumentative with mods.\n\nEvery subreddit has an additional unwritten rule: moderators have the right and the power to silently remove a submission for any reason, even if that submission conforms perfectly to subreddit rules.  But when submissions obey the rules of the subreddit, shadowremoval, if I can call it that, of those submissions is just plain rude.  No moderator comment, no PM, no flair on the submission indicating its problems: one minute your submission is generating interesting discussion, and the next minute it's gone.\n\nI'm an old married man, so thankfully I don't need to deal with the reportedly increasing popularity of \"ghosting\" from romantic relationships.  But I now think I have an inkling of what that would be like.\n\n(Yes, I've sent a message to the relevant moderators about my most recently shadowremoved submission, without reply as yet.  But it's rude even to put anyone in the position of needing to do that.)\n\n^(edit: removed stray \"the\")",

Follow the steps below to participate!**\n \nHello reddit!\n \nMy name is Greg Tilton and I've been producing a documentary about Reddit since early 2014 with an incredible team of redditors and non-redditors alike. We have done interviews with several key members of reddit's staff (past and present), as well as redditors and tech colleagues across the country (Senator Wyden also jumped in!).\n\nWe are currently editing and have one last thing we want to do - we are doing an open call to redditors to submit their stories, especially ones about major events in reddit's history (tech activism, the Boston bomber, \"reddit shutdown\" in 2015, and so much more).\n \nWe really want to get as many stories as possible and think this film just won't work without a broader perspective from the Reddit community. We just can't \"move around\" the internet and find people like a traditional doc production, so we are seeing who wants to come forward in various communities.\nIf you are interested, here’s what to do! \n\n1. Go [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/0BzryUcUKKumPdFVFRjByWm9fOE0) for the questions and a standard interview release. We cannot use your stories if you do not sign this release! Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns. \n \n2. Questions are broken up by topic - answer any and all questions you want to. Just let us know which section(s) of questions you are answering so we can navigate your responses. A simple, “I’m going to answer the questions about the Boston Bomber incident” is plenty!\n \n3. You can record video or audio, whichever you prefer, though we highly encourage video interviews if you are comfortable. There are no technical requirements here (for those interested, we have “ideal” specs in the comments). You may use your phone, webcam, whatever. If you want to remain anonymous we are happy to blur your face/distort your voice - we want everyone to feel comfortable and excited to participate!\n \n4. Simply upload your release and interview to the drive - you can make your own folder if you’d like - and we will take it from there. \n \nIf you have any questions, contact us here or at redditdoc@gmail.com. Thank you all SO MUCH for your time and consideration. We are so thrilled about this project and thankful for everyone’s participation.\n",

This sample is only about 12 hours in length starting after they came back:\n\n http://i.imgur.com/pKorRAc.png\n\nI also have a partial data set (several days) for /r/NatureIsFuckingLit\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mZ23PbS.png\n\n***\n\nI'm shutting the experiment down because I'd like to make some improvements. What would be some smart ways to look at reddit? Top 100 r-all? Rising, popular? Do I need to take longer reads from big subs? What would be some good subs to watch?",

        "text": "So, anyone who has been on Reddit, or even heard of it, knows that this site has a reputation for adoring animals of the feline variety. Such a reputation has been extended to the internet as a whole as a result.\n\nHowever, as someone who is a cat person, I feel like Reddit (and the internet at large) is much more dog-obsessed than cat-obsessed. My theory is that dog people and the obsession over dogs is much more common in most of Western society than cat people/cat obsession. People therefore see that as the \"default,\" and don't notice that dog posts far outweigh cat posts on Reddit.\n\nFirst, let's look at pet stats. According [this page from Live Science](http://www.livescience.com/32415-whats-the-most-popular-pet.html) (this may not be the most reputable source, but it's what I found), the world's most popular pet is freshwater fish, with an estimated 142 million individuals owned worldwide. Cats are next, with 88.3 million owned, and dogs are third with 74.8 million. Birds are a distant fourth with 16 million. \n\nIn the US specifically, it breaks down like [this, according to the American Veterinary Medicine Association](https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-research-statistics-US-pet-ownership.aspx)(which is a much more reliable source, albeit limited to one geographical area). Cats are technically more popular, but more households own dogs than cats (36.5% vs. 30.4%). The difference comes from the *number* of each owned, with dog ownership averaging 1.6 per household, and cat ownership averaging 2.1. \n\nNow, let's look at the data from Reddit itself. Between 8:00 AM 9:00 AM CST, I did a quick tally of the current 500 hottest posts on r/all, current top 500 all time posts on r/all, and the current top 100 posts in r/aww. \n\nFor the current 500 hottest posts, 31 are photos of animals. 7 photos have cats only, 9 have dogs only, one had multiple types of animals, and 14 contain animals other than cats or dogs. This means that 6.2% of posts were photos featuring animals, and, of those, 22.6% were of cats and 29.0% were of dogs. [Pie chart](https://www.meta-chart.com/share/r-hottest-500)\n\nFor the current top 500 posts of all time, 67 were of animals. Dogs *far* outweighed cats here, with 35 photos compared to 8 for cats. (52.2% vs. 11.9%). Now, this data is a bit skewed, as the scoring changes have filled these top spots with almost entirely posts from the past six months. However, it definitely shows a strong trend toward dogs over cats. [Pie chart](https://www.meta-chart.com/share/rall-top-500-all-time)\n\nr/aww follows this trend as well. Of the current top 100 posts there, 24 portray only cats, 52 portray dogs only, 2 had multiple types of animals (somewhat surprising to me), and 20 were of animals other than cats or dogs. The difference is not quite as big as the top r/all posts of all time, but it's still over double. [Pie chart](https://www.meta-chart.com/share/raww-hottest-100)\n\nSo what can be determined from these stats? First of all, it seems like dogs, not cats, dominate animal photo posts on Reddit in terms of popularity, as measured by karma score. Every area I studied had dogs winning out over cats. This goes against both worldwide and American stats in terms pet ownership. However, this is *one* day's tally. A longitudinal study would be required to determine if there are any long term trends. Furthermore, the cat-loving reputation of Reddit is something that has existed for a long time, and perhaps the increased popularity and visibility of Reddit has grown the site the point to which this reputation is no longer true.\n\nUltimately, while my data shows that dog posts are typically higher in terms of upvotes and karma, I don't believe I can come up with any conclusions without a longer-term study, including a historical study (which I don't believe is necessarily possible, without more work than I'm willing to put into it).",
