His opponent, Rick Scott, is the current governor of Florida.\n\nPolls have shown that despite Scott being at rock-bottom since the beginning of the year, [he has shot up over summer and is now ahead of Nelson in pretty much every poll.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/fl/florida_senate_scott_vs_nelson-6246.html#polls) Political pundits are calling this race a toss-up or a lean-republican race now.\n\nThis forecast is quite surprising as Nelson is a popular senator, and Rick Scott has faced many controversies in the past (ie resigning from his company due to a Medicare fraud, only winning the governorship in an extremely close vote, accusations of closing polls in Democrat-predominant areas, etc). Furthermore, with the national climate and Trump's unpopularity among the general population, one would expect Democrats to be running away with this race especially in a swing state like Florida.\n\nYet that isn't happening. Why are Republicans doing so well here? Can the Democrats turn this ship around before November?",

        "text": "I thought of this scenario and it scares me that I legitimately don't know the answer. On one hand, the Chinese government is oppressive and very unpopular with the citizens of democracies. However, a collapse of the Chinese government would wreak havoc on the world economy in ways I'm not sure anyone is currently prepared to deal with. The US is highly dependent on low cost Chinese manufacturing, and any disruption in this system could be devastating. Even right now with the trade war, we're starting to see impacts on American manufacturing and consumer goods. Imagine if instead of costing more, many Chinese exports just *stopped*.\n\nWould the US Government consider supporting the Chinese government? Would they attempt to support a Taiwanese takeover? Would they support the rebels? Would they do nothing and let American economic interests suffer? I honestly can't say. Any of these moves would cause horrible political backlash for anyone in office. It's kind of a lose-lose situation. Any action directly against the Chinese military could start World War 3, and I'm not sure America could win that one. Supporting the Chinese government would have the US supporting an oppressive communist regime, which would be political suicide for anyone who supported this action. Doing nothing could cause a US economic collapse, which has historically not been good for anyone in charge.\n\nI don't know how the situation is in China right now and I don't know how feasible an actual attempt at a revolution actually is. It seems like the Chinese government is desperately trying to prevent this from ever happening, and they have been doing a pretty good job of it for a very long time.  I just like thinking about these \"what if?\" scenarios.",

        "text": "[Source]\n(https://www.npr.org/2018/08/25/641725402/dnc-set-to-reduce-role-of-superdelegates-in-presidential-nominating-process)\n\n&gt;The Democratic National Committee dramatically reduced the power and influence of \"superdelegates\" in selecting the party's presidential nominee at their summer meeting in Chicago on Saturday, ahead of what's expected to be a wide-open Democratic field in 2020.\n\n&gt;DNC members voted on a proposal to take away the role of elected officials and other party dignitaries in selecting a nominee at the Democratic convention — leaving it up to delegates selected in primaries and caucuses only — unless the process becomes deadlocked.\n\n&gt;Opponents of the move stood down and the measures were adopted in a voice vote. A DNC panel overwhelmingly approved the move earlier this summer.\n\n&gt;The reforms adopted also encourage states that hold presidential caucuses, run by state parties, to switch to primaries, administered by state and local election officials. They require caucuses, in-person meetings, to have some provision for absentee participation, citing barriers to participation ranging from military service to child care to disability.\n\n* How will these affect the candidates and performance of the Democratic party?\n\n* Will these reforms help or hinder the party in 2020 and the long run?\n\n* Should other parties like the Republicans, Libertarians, or Greens adopt such reforms?",

        "text": "My father is a survivor of Pol Pot's regime, his family were one of the lucky few who were able to escape into neighboring countries and later gain refugee status with the help of UN agencies. It has been officially estimated that up to *a quarter* of the entire Cambodian population were purged during Khmer Rogue rule.\n\nThe fact that **Hun Sen, the current Prime Minister of Cambodia** is a former Khmer Rouge official seems to suggest that international intervention and response to the genocide was, at best, inadequate. What's more - reports are surfacing that Hun Sen utilises corruption, **political violence** (suppression and imprisonment of opposition party members, but there are currently talks of an amnesty for political prisoners) and **control of media** (the most prominent independent newspaper was shut down in 2017 and radio stations forbidden to broadcast American news sources) to secure his power. This is especially concerning as the country is still struggling to recover from the effects of the Khmer Rouge era.\n\nIt's difficult to comprehend that the genocide took place in the 1970s, which still seems considerably recent. And now in 2018 it seems that Cambodia is in danger of heading once again towards a dictatorship where the very notion of democracy is compromised. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter? Is Hun Sen heading down a similar path to Philippine's Rodrigo Duterte? Is this just the process of a developing nation adapting to democracy, or is this a warning sign that something more sinister could happen?",

        "text": "Given the events of this week, the likelihood of Trump serving out his entire term is more in doubt than ever. It could end in a variety of ways, including resignation, or protracted impeachment/trial, but one of the most daunting outcomes would be a quick and decisive impeachment and conviction as early as 2019. This would result in his removal from office, with Pence likely to serve some part of the remaining term, assuming he too is not implicated, or does not resign. There are some scenarios that could result in a brief (Edit: Forgot about speaker being #2, so Ryan/Pelosi/McCarthy) Grassley, Leahy, or even McConnell Presidency, although those are much less likely.\n\nIn any event, what actions that were taken under his executive authority and executive privilege should be immediately reversed? and which actions should be automatically reconsidered? Does anyone other than the next President have the power to actually take those measures?\n\nEdit: The basis for the question was not whether you agree with his actions, but instead: The grounds for his potential impeachment would most likely be the illegitimacy of his election victory, due to criminal fraudulent use of campaign funds and personnel, AND the cover-up and denial of those actions. If that scenario comes to pass, how do we determine which actions of an illegitimate President should be repealed, nullified, or reconsidered?",
