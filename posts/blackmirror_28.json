        "text": "Recently I went on a short trip to Qatar.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Saudi Arabia recently began a very sudden (to the outside world) blockade and condemnation of Qatar, after decades of friendship. For IR students like me, it's a hell of a fascinating place to be right now. Not just the wild desert landscapes, but also the political climate is so deliciously dramatic. I got some fantastic photographs and also included some interesting commentary on them on Instagram.\n\nSo I've been posting those pictures on Instagram, and receive one comment from a girl I went to summer school in the Netherlands with last year. She said she was envious of my eye-opening trip.\n\nNow this girl is no every day classmate. She's a fucking genius, and she's gorgeous too, as well as the owner of an incredibly impressive resum√©, including NATO, the UK Foreign Ministry and God knows what else. And she's popular, people try to impress her. She's what every other girl wants to be.\n\nIts the first time she's ever commented on any of my posts, and I couldn't believe she said she was envious. She doesn't even comment on our other summer school classmates' posts, and they're pretty impressive too - sojourns around China, trekking across the Norwegian mountains, diving in the Adriatic. I was really happy with myself.\n\nAnd then my phone locked and I saw Bryce Dallas Howard looking breathlessly back at me in my reflection. \n\nHelp.",

        "text": "**Ratings**\n\nA while ago [I submitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/85t6dj/black_mirror_episodes_analytics/) a request for people to rate Black Mirror episodes in order to do some analytics.\n\nThe original post didn't get a ton of exposure, but I did get 57 responses, which I feel is enough to present at least a somewhat interesting analysis.\n\nI present to you, /r/blackmirror's favorite Black Mirror episode:\n\n***White Christmas!***\n\nWhite Christmas was not only the most popular, but it also had the lowest standard deviation, which means that people were not in disagreement about it being good. Number 2, not trailing by much, is Shut Up and Dance, also with a relatively low standard deviation.\n\nFollowing up, /r/blackmirror's least favorite episode by a HUGE margin (also the fourth most controversial):\n\n***The Waldo Moment!***\n\nA lot of people just *hated* this episode, and gave it a 1/10. Other people gave it a spectrum of ratings, but all those 1/10's brought it down and made it \"controversial\". \n\nBe Right Back, the uncontroversial favorite from the three articles I linked in the last post, was eleventh place. Not a super controversial eleventh place either; only 5/47 people ranked it lower than 5.\n\nMy favorite, USS Callister, was the second least controversial episode, and it got 4th place. So people mostly liked it, but not as much as White Christmas.\n\nThe consensus worst from the compilation of articles, Men Against Fire, was the sixth worst according to Reddit, and not particularly controversial. \n\n[Here is the graph](https://imgur.com/a/4FYqF), complete with error bars (the longer the error bar, the more controversial the episode):\n\n**Heat Map**\n\nAnother analysis I though of was to look at the correlations between episodes. This would give you an idea, if you're trying to decide what episode to watch next (or what episode you want your friend/SO/family to watch). If you liked a certain episode, what other episode might you like? If you disliked a certain episode, what's a good episode should you try next? For example, if you like a smart, funny, entertaining episode about VR and full of cool Star Trek references, maybe you wouldn't like an episode about a miserable, sweaty, crying dude fucking a pig.\n\nSome actual hypotheses (mild spoilers ahead):\n\nPeople who like \"The Waldo Moment\" will also like \"The National Anthem\" and \"Hated in the Nation\" (because I feel like those are all \"I hate politicians\" episodes).\n\nPeople who liked \"San Junipero\" will also like \"Hang the DJ\" (romantic episodes)\n\nPeople who like \"Playtest\" will also like \"Men Against Fire\" (a brain implant making you see imaginary stuff)\n\n[Here's the actual heat map](https://imgur.com/a/iwVaF).\n\nAn interesting thing I noticed from this, is that \"White Christmas\" and \"Black Museum\" are strongly correlated, so the same people liked the two episodes with \"mini-episodes\" in them.\n\nOne of my three predictions was right: \"San Junipero\" lovers also liked \"Hang the DJ.\"\n\n**Clustering**\n\nFor those of you still reading, I also made a [hierarchical cluster map](https://imgur.com/a/31aPc).\n\nI can't really see anything illuminating here, aside from San Junipero being paired up with Hang the DJ. Also, \"Entire History of You\" is about a relationship, though I wouldn't call it \"romantic\". \"Fifteen Million Merits\" also has a relationship element, so I guess we can call the furthest left branch the \"relationship\" branch. I'm open to ideas about the other branches. \"White Christmas\" and \"White Bear\" both involve punishing a criminal?\n\nAnyway, hopefully people found this marginally entertaining. Cheers!",

I'd imagine that Jack would at least fight to put her in an android. And then I thought, what if Haynes altered Jack's mind? Haynes claimed that humans only use 40% of their brain, which has been shown to be untrue, so Jack's consciousness would need to somehow be compressed in order to fit Carrie. Well, what if Haynes took the opportunity to alter Jack's mind to be nonresistant to whatever experiment he might throw at him? It fits perfectly with Haynes character, considering he never tells his clients the full risks or consequences of his experiments. And it makes Jack a great test subject. Any thoughts?",

        "text": "On the season 5 filming announcement thread I saw some people mentioning what they hope to see (largely \"no cookies\", it would seem) but I thought I'd make a thread specifically for current tech-related issues that'd make for a good story (for which you're also free to submit some ideas). \n\nMy ideas:\n\n- Cryptocurrency. I'm not following the news on Bitcoin as avidly as some others are but I think the show could explore the consequences of digital currency in terms of the privacy/security concerns surrounding the existing debate.\n\n- News media. This one might be a bit challenging to do without seeming too on-the-nose, since the ongoing conversation about social media and \"fake news\" is already feeling a bit like a BM episode (see: the Sinclair Broadcast Group's propaganda script that hundreds of local news stations had to recite). But I think Brooker is a good enough writer to walk this tightrope elegantly.\n\n- Environmentalism. Right now the big issue is that the US government is tarnishing existing protections on the environment in service to corporations, but I think Black Mirror could do something fun and counterintuitive by analyzing the other end of the spectrum: technology explicitly intended to save the environment, and what the potential consequences of that could be. Or perhaps some kind of simulated environment designed to eliminate the risks of global warming, or to give nature an advantage over man. Hated in the Nation explored this to some degree with the robotic bees, which were implemented to prevent colony collapse disorder and were set to go after that Chancellor (who says \"fuck the environmental impact!\" in one scene). But the theme of that episode was mainly civility on social media, not the environment.\n\nWhat you guys' thoughts on this?",

        "text": "I recently got into Black Mirror (on Hated in the Nation right now) and I have to say, it's really good. One of my favorite episodes was San Junipero, even though it was much less \"deep\" than other endings, it was breath of fresh air from all of the darker social commentaries of other episodes. Thus, I noticed it got a hate for this.\nIt's understandable, of course, since it parted from the typical \"formula\" quite heavily. A lot of people aren't into the romance/drama theme. However one of the major reasons to why it got hate was because it had a lesbian relationship. A lot of people said it was \"shoving homosexuality down the viewer's throats\" which I felt was ridiculous. Some people only disliked the episode for this reason, which is plainly and simply, homophobic.\nI noticed the recent spike in attention that Black Mirror has gained caused something I call \"Rick and Morty Syndrome\" to occur. This is basically where a large portion of a fandom acts more intelligent or claims intelligence is needed to understand the plot and meanings, and also dictates what the rules and formula of the source material are (which then causes any episodes that diverge to be hated upon.) I've seen people claim Black Mirror is only a show for very intelligent people, and also drag an episode for being different than their idea of a formula.\nWhat's everyone's opinion on this?",

For some people they have... what I guess is \"entertainment jobs\", and they're more well off in some weird sense. \n\nWhat people do on their spare time seem to be nothing but endlessly watching mediocre \"tv-shows\" of little variety, and being FORCED to watch the advertisement that can even be in the most vulgar form possible. I'm sorry but I don't want to watch a porn-ad in between my Henry VIII documentary. But if I don't watch it the tv-screen cube I live in start screaming at me to watch. \n\nAnd that's pretty much it! \n\nAt the end of the episode we see Bing look out at some sort of jungle. Was that a screen too? IS THERE LIFE OUTSIDE THIS ENCLOSED SPACE?!\n\nWas this episode just trying to parody ALL of modern society? The one's who can't work gets shunned and is forced to do a lower work task while those who work hard gets a chance at greater success? The enclosed laboratory setting is like how we're all trapped around the confides of where we live, without the freedom to move at will? The merits is money/school grades/whatever other thing you can come up with? The entertainment they're forced to watch is just the media of today, with all the obscene and vulgarity packed in and you have no choice but to take part in it unless you want to \"progress\"?\n\nWhat does it all mean?

It seemed to me like there was an intentional contrast being shown between the dark, grey storage area where their consciousness was being kept (reality) and the happy, false world of San Junipero. Not to mention that the protagonist essentially abandoned her husband and her earthly convictions in order to skirt death. \n\nWhat do you think, is this an \"intended interpretation?\" Is this aspect open to interpretation at all? Have the creators weighed in on how they intended it?\n\nDo people flee to San Junipero because they truly want to keep living (even if it's false), or do they do it because they fear death?

The bastard even shoots back. ‚ÄúYou only shot one bollock? Boooo!‚Äù \n\nAnyway, because Annapurna recently published *What Remains of Edith Finch* and Universal has similarly expressed interest in making more videogames, I suspect it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Netflix makes a play in the interactive medium. \n\nAside from *Stranger Things*, *Black Mirror* is the only Netflix IP which springs to mind as being (somewhat) suitable as a game. And, whether you approve or not, an adaptation does make sense from a business perspective. \n\nI‚Äôve pitched ways that ‚ÄòCrocodile‚Äô and ‚ÄòMetalhead‚Äô could have been reimagined as games (https://everybodywinsontheinternet.wordpress.com/), but the real draw would be original interactive ideas that mess with players‚Äô minds. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would short, one-off, downloadable *Black Mirror* games be of interest to you (focusing on a unique game mechanic and story), or would you rather see Brooker throw his weight behind an original videogame project? \n\nAll I know is that gaming needs characters like Rolo Haynes and Patrick from *Dead Set*.

But going into it, the patient should know that there's a 50/50 chance that the you that you feel you are will either stay in the real person's body or end up in the device, if that makes sense. If this is the case, shouldn't the cookie react more along the lines of, \"Damn, this sucks, but I knew what I was getting into. Let's go home and make some toast.\"? It wouldn't be perfect, but it would certainly make for a smoother transition for the cookie post-operation.",
