She is a leading authority on the subject, deeply knowledgable, knows all the flowers and ratios and storage etc. Gets paid to speak at conferences and teach other budding homeopaths. \n\nThe issue being of course that homeopathy doesn't have any scientific basis. So she's become an expert on all the complexity that sits above the premise that 'homeopathy is a legit medicine'. Which I would argue is a false premise. \n\nYet there are conferences, schools and conventions all dedicated to discussing the complexity around homeopathy. \n\n\nI wondered if there was a word for this phenomena/fallacy in philosophy?\n\n\nI think it would extend to a lot of areas of modern society. From wild conspiracy theories, to CRT. Where you have this huge topic sitting on top of specious or debatable premises.",

Please tell me what are the alternatives to Buddhism to end suffering?\n On the one hand, Buddhism seems reasonable and logical to me.\n\n I do not believe in gods, heaven, hell, karma, rebirth, talking deer and other sovereign anti-scientific garbage.  But the four noble truths of Buddhism seem very reasonable to me:\n\n 1. There is suffering.\n\n 2. There is a cause of suffering - desire, the search for pleasure in one or the other, the thirst for existence, which moves living beings into the future.\n\n 3. There is a possibility of cessation of suffering - liberation and cessation of desires to achieve equanimity and equanimity.\n\n 4. There is a noble eightfold path leading to the cessation of suffering: moral behavior leads to a calm conscience and mind, the abandonment and cessation of sensual desires and meditation leads to altered states of consciousness and the achievement of impartiality and equanimity of the mind and liberation from suffering.\n\n Actually, nothing but Buddhism seems reasonable and logical to me.  I am convinced that the Buddha was right about the four noble truths (with the exception of superstitious anti-scientific rubbish from his time).  The problem is that Buddhism doesn't work with me.  I continue to suffer.  Impartiality and equanimity of mind I have not achieved.\n\n I would like to know what are the alternatives to Buddhism to end suffering?  I don't have enough education in liberal arts and philosophy, so I'm asking someone with more knowledge to help.\n\n (Unfortunately, I don’t have the courage to commit suicide, so this option is out of the question for now)",

I feel like we *know* that causality happens in one direction and can only truthfully react to it in this one direction. Maybe time travel is possible in a *Back to the Future* sort of way, I wouldn't know. But the question of causality to me is like, we might try to question causality but aren't we only ever questioning what caused what, in some sort of way? \n\nI mean there are ideas about how one thing leads to another I guess, but the whole notion of causality includes things like: I don't cross the street when a car is coming. I don't shoot my guns at people. I choose to eat these things feeling like eating these things will have an effect on me (my taste buds, my overall health, my feeling of fullness). These things all involve some form of causal inference, don't they?\n\nWhat else could there be? Maybe some form of chaos actually has a place in the universe - but at a certain point all of my perceptions are somehow grounded in a system of causal inference: when I see things, touch things, or whatever it is that's happening, I have the only information I'm going to react to based off of what I experienced previously.\n\nIs there any other way to see things?",

Or rather, would the \"same person\" wake up, or would they die and an identical but new person be born?\n\nMy intuition is leading me to believe the latter, but I can't quite break down why into fundamental, objective, logical pieces. I guess my belief relies solely on the similarity between death and the cessation of chemical and electrical activity that occurs in this hypothetical. It seems to meet the criteria for death, so the idea seems very strange to me that there is any \"coming back\". I guess a more concrete way of thinking about it is this: if we could someone construct a perfect copy of a person, poof, right in front of them, we would all agree that there are 2 separate people, right? That's because of the lack of spatial locality. The consciousnesses are separated in the dimensions of space. In my hypothetical, the consciousness is separated in the dimension of time. There is a lack of temporal locality (there's probably a better term for that?). The moments of brain activity are not next to each other - there is a time gap, much like the distance in space separating the original and the copy in the copy thought experiment.\n\nThis is very similar to the \"teleporter problem\" that has often been discussed, but I think using the same exact person, without really destroying them, makes it easier to think and reason about, but with the same root question.\n\nThis is a refinement of my same old thinking that the only think keeping me \"me\", alive and uniquely myself, is the continuous stream of my brain's chemical and electrical activity through spacetime. Breaking it down into spatial and temporal arguments makes things clearer, I think.\n\nWhat do other people think?",

But please watch it, the visuals can help understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"In this article, Doctor Scranton posits a theory about the nature of reality, and understanding\n\nhim is the first step towards understanding SCP-3812.\n\nHis ”Recursive Stack” theory states that there are different layers to reality, but\n\nalso that no single universe is “real.”\n\nAn easy way to think of it is to imagine a sitcom, any sitcom you can envision will do.\n\nBetween us, and the fictional world of a sitcom, there are multiple observable stacked universes.\n\nFirstly, our universe, the ”real world” as we experience it, forms the baseline, so\n\nimagine this sitting at the top of the stack.\n\nNext down in the stack comes the sitcom, a fictional universe filled with characters,\n\nwhich fits below our universe.\n\nThen, think of what is fiction within the fiction of the sitcom, perhaps another television\n\nshow, one that only exists in the world of the sitcom, but not in our own.\n\nThis is the Recursive Stack, infinitely layered universes, and it is crucial you can envision\n\nand remember this model.\n\nDoctor Scranton’s theory suggests that any universe, even our own, could potentially\n\nexist as a fictional narrative within another, wider universe.\n\nThis wider universe, in which ours is a fiction, could also itself be a narrative within an\n\neven wider universe stacked above it, and so on.\n\nIt’s interesting to picture reality this way, isn’t it?\n\nIn fact, I’m willing to bet that you’re wondering, maybe there’s a universe above\n\nours, or even one above that.\n\nWould the universe right at the top of the stack be the truly “real” world?\n\nAnd what if you could travel between each stacked reality?\n\nIf you are asking any of those questions, then congratulations, you sound exactly like\n\nSCP-3812.\"",

A lot of this has to do with the sentence structure of old English. From what I remember, Hume says that a vacuum can be conceived as an idea, because if you were to suck out the matter from a room, the walls in which the room is made up can't collapse on each other without moving, meaning that the vacuum is existent. Later on though, Hume says that the vacuum can't be added on as an extension after using the blind man analogy that the distance between 2 things are inconceivable just like voids to someone who understands that darkness is there, but a blind man like everyone else would not be able to understand this? sorry if that last part is not understandable I am lost within this section of book 1.",

To be clear, I don’t mean to suggest that a machine can’t be conscious, or that it must be conscious in the same way as humans.

The effete intellectual element in this crepuscular West, instead of manfully engaging the threat to the \"values\" of \"anarcho-egalitarian demo-social moralism\" Nietzsche's philosophy represents, has mendaciously offered to the thinker, a hypocritical, compensating adoration born of its own cognitive dissonance, and lack of intellectual integrity. Nietzsche's philosophy was never not a threat to the \"liberal humanist West\", and I was simply wondering if any modern Westerners have grown tired of lying to themselves and others, presenting Nietzsche as some sort of postmodernist guru of \"liberal-democratic pluralism and creativity\", BLAH BLAH BLAH. Implicitly, I mean authors, writers, thinkers and intellectuals, who write books and create impact. Has there been any scholastic self-reckoning at all...? I actually doubt this, given today's climate, but I do wonder... The last time I read a book on Nietzsche from a recent writer, pure horror: Nietzsche supposedly was an \"agonistic friendly critic\" of the global classical liberalism holding sway today, the only meaning of Nietzsche's repudiation of democracy is revealed in \"populist Trumpism\", Nietzsche was more \"woke\" than \"woke\" itself (huh?), a prophet of postmodern self-identity politics, and such nonsense... Only modern mentally bifurcated Westerners could be so stupid and false-minded as to tolerate such drivel. Has the situation improved...? I suppose, more simply, the question might be: have any scholars of repute of non-virtual scholarliness, finally admitted the truth here, say, in literary or published form...? I do indeed recall a small handful of tomes did indeed honestly reckon with Nietzsche's \"aristocratic radicalism\", even before the non-issue of positioning Nietzsche in relation to National Socialism (a few European, British scholars were honest; a few 80's scholars somehow sneakily bypassed the groupthink, too) - curiously, these specific books kept disappearing more and more from libraries... Thanks in advance if any one feels up to answering.\n\nIf anyone is offended by my stark language, I apologize and am not actually antisocial: I am just merely exhausted and frustrated with how dishonest modern people have become in their fashionable moralist \"crowdism\". No mentally fit person could read THE GREEK STATE (1870) and exist confused or uncertain as to Nietzsche's outlook: the essay is utterly concise and expressive unmistakably as to the meaning of Nietzsche's world-view and social-political \"philosophy\" - these beliefs he held unto his last breath. I wasted years going through literature trying to convince me Nietzsche was a harmless aesthete, the ultra-democrat, etc., etc. and how so very similar to us \"woke\" people Nietzsche was at bottom: time wasted, and never recoverable.",

I read the ones that are freely accessible but did not find the objections very convincing: Wolf asserts there might be preferences which are also good even if not satisfied without much further detail, Larock presents a pretty far-fetched hypothetical example where antifrustrationism might not apply and Arrhenius seems to argue mainly against the population ethics stuff in Fehige's paper. \n\nLooking for any other objections or arguments you might have in store.

For example, the word 'water' has always referred to H2O, no matter whether the speaker lived in the 1950 (after the discovery of that molecule) or in the 1750 (before the discovery).\n\nAnalogously, if one person was in a virtual simulation and pointed to a chair, and another was in the real world and pointed to a chair, they would be referring to different things, even if their psychological states were the same. The former would be referring to whatever makes up that image (some pixels in the screen), and the latter would be referring the the conglomeration of atoms that makes up the chair.\n\nMy question then is: How does me saying the word 'chair' latch onto the chair in the real world? In virtue of what fact, process or rule does me saying 'chair' latch on to the chair I'm seeing, and not to the table beside it, or to a different chair in another room?\n\nThis seems related to Kripkenstein's skeptical challenge, but I don't know if I could even bring up the speaker's disposition to call something 'chair', because the reference seems somewhat independent of their psychological state. It's something that happens no matter whether they know what the chair is or not.",

        "text": "Is there a difference, and if so, what is the difference? \n\nI'm asking the distinction sometimes comes up in Swedish political discourse, especially regarding the moral obligation of humanitarian aid and helping refugees, as in the Swedish translation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights it says \"All human beings are born free and equal in ***value*** and rights\" rather than \"All human beings are born free and equal in ***dignity*** and rights\" which it does in English and most versions. \n\nPeople say it's a mistranslation via the German version where it says \"Würde\" (dignity), which is a false friend \"värde\" (value). \n\nExample of google translated Swedish articles arguing they are not equal: [one](https://www-gp-se.translate.goog/ledare/%C3%A4r-vi-verkligen-alla-lika-v%C3%A4rda-1.60710192?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp), [two](https://www-na-se.translate.goog/2017-12-23/alla-manniskor-lika-varde-ar-en-feloversattning?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp).\n\nHowever, [the Stanford encyclopedia article on equality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equality/), which this subreddit seems to hold as an authoritative source, seems to treat \"human value\" and \"human dignity\" as close to synonymous: \n\n&gt; The principle that holds that human beings, despite their differences, are to be regarded as one another’s equals, is often also called ‘human equality’ or ‘basic equality’ or ‘equal worth’ or ‘human dignity’ (William 1962, Vlastos 1962, Kateb 2014, Waldron 2017, Rosen 2018). Whether these terms are synonyms is a matter of interpretation, but “they cluster together to form a powerful body of principle” (Waldron 2017, p. 3).\n&gt; \n&gt; This fundamental idea of equal respect for all persons and of the equal worth or equal dignity of all human beings (Vlastos 1962) is widely accepted (Carter 2011, but see also Steinhoff 2015). In a period in which there is not agreement across the members of a complex society to any one metaphysical, religious, or traditional view (Habermas 1983, p. 53, 1992, pp. 39–44), it appears impossible to peacefully reach a general agreement on common political aims without accepting that persons must be treated as equals. As a result, moral equality constitutes the ‘egalitarian plateau’ for all contemporary political theories (Kymlicka 1990, p. 5).",

        "text": "Hello everyone! \n\nMy question is the following: \n\nTo what extent were the so-called later works of Husserl meant to challenge the roots of totalitarianism? It sounds a bit clumsy, but I'll try to explain. In his Vienna lecture \"Philosophy and the Crisis of European Man\" in 1935, Husserl attacks naturalism and objectivism while speaking of Europe as a \"fraternal relationship that gives us the consciousness of being at home in this circle. This attack on objectivism may be an indication that Husserl encountered and felt the \"scientific\" and \"objective\" methods of the Nazi totalitarian movement. Since it used \"objectivity\" to identify its members (e.g., party members in some cases had to prove their ancestry back to the 1750s), there was also a notion of \"objective enemy\" that was applied to Husserl when he was forced out of the academy. As Arendt writes: \"Ideologies are known for their scientific character: they combine the scientific approach with results of philosophical relevance and pretend to be scientific philosophy.\" And the appeal to fraternity or community can be an answer to loneliness (which, according to Arendt, is the origin of a totalitarian movement).  \n\nThat said, Husserl's lecture shouldn't be undermined as a nihilistic reaction, as a mere \"screw your objectivity\". On the contrary, it seems to be a genuine analysis of what went wrong, a brave gaze into the surrounding. \n\nHow plausible is this reading? Are there any articles on Husserl's views on politics or a description of his relationship with the regime?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10waii7/im_looking_for_responses_to_this_rebuttal_of_the/",
        "text": "I have been looking at the most common objections of the fine tuning argument and researching different rebuttals to see how strong the objections really are. I want to go through the objections one by one so I can really make sure I’m doing these arguments justice. The first objection I would like to attack is the “Lottery winner” objection. I’ll do another post for the puddle analogy objection next.\n\nHere is a quick summary of the argument:\n\nThe fine-tuning argument states that the universe appears to be specifically and delicately calibrated in order to sustain life. This apparent fine-tuning is so precise and improbable that it is reasonable to infer that the universe was designed for this purpose.\n\nThe premise of the argument is as follows:\n\n1.) The fine-tuning of the initial conditions of the universe is due to either physical necessity, chance, or design.\n\n2.) The fine-tuning is not due to physical necessity or chance.\n\n3.) Therefore, the fine-tuning is due to design.\n\n\n\n                    The objection\n\nA common analogy used to reject the fine tuning argument is the anthropic lottery winner objection which states that the apparent fine-tuning of the universe is merely a result of luck and chance, and that we are simply the lucky recipients of an incredibly unlikely series of events. \n\nAccording to this view, we are the equivalent of lottery winners who have won the cosmic jackpot, rather than evidence for a divine designer. \n\nFor example, any one person’s odds of winning the lottery is very unlikely, but we don’t examine the lottery winner and figure out how fine tuned he is for winning. Improbable is still possible and luck is all the explanation we need. \n\nThe problem with this analogy is that even though the fact that someone wins the lottery is not unlikely and may be possible to explain the existence of life as a result of chance, it still doesn’t explain the underlying cause of the fine-tuning itself. The likelihood of the universe being finely tuned by chance is incredibly small. \n\nA better analogy would be if someone picked a random person beforehand and that person ended up winning the lottery. Their odds of winning the lottery are incredibly unlikely, and it wouldn't be out of the question to consider factors other than luck if they ended up winning after they were predicted to win.\n\nAnother good example would be Trent Horns poker analogy. “Imagine that you are playing poker with a friend, and he gets a royal flush. You don’t question his apparent luck—until he wins ten hands in a row, all with royal flushes. Now you think he must be cheating, because that explanation is more probable than luck. Well, the odds of our universe just happening to be finely tuned would be comparable to the odds of getting fifty royal flushes in a row! If we reject chance as an explanation for an improbable poker game, shouldn’t we reject chance as an explanation for an even more improbable universe?”\n\nIn conclusion, the anthropic principle is insufficient as a response to the fine-tuning argument for God. While it provides a possible explanation for why the universe is compatible with life, it does not account for the precision of the fine-tuning, requires its own fine-tuning, and is based on speculative and unproven ideas.",

Despite their both being named and shaped; baskets. \n\nHe asserts this solution at the aim of solving Russell’s Paradox in the tone of replacing Russell’s Theory of Types solution. (P 3.331) \n\nWhy does he focus on Dispelling the Theory of Types solution instead of the Vicious Circle Principle (as in Russell’s and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica) which was published before the Tractatus? \n\nIs it just that he arrives at the Theory of Types through talking about logical syntaxes in 3.33? \nDoes he agree with the Vicious Circle Principle? \n\nIt seems a rather strange construction to bring about such a solution to the Problem. Why doesn’t he state the Vicious Circle Principle instead of his own logically symbolic premises? Is this just a translation of the Vicious Circle Principle? If so why doesn’t he name it such? \n\nHis main idea seems to me to prove a \nLogical Language cannot allow Symbols to correspond to two meanings or visa versa, and uses the infamous paradox to articulate this. But surly the Vicious Circle Principal deals with this just a nicely, and predates his Tractatus. \nFor it would be that Symbols have no meaning if they are both a constituent and a totality of the same thing. \n\nMany questions, which all do not need answers. Just searching for some context if people have it! \n\nAnd perhaps to spark a debate…\n\nThank you.",

At the end it says:\n\n\\&gt;  The other aspect that attracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson’s criticism of the concept of negation in *Creative Evolution*. We must recall that the linguistic turn in France during the 1960s was accompanied by an “anti-Hegelianism.” Thus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the Hegelian dialectic, the negative. Moreover, at the end of his life, Merleau-Ponty was also coming to realize that Bergson’s criticism of negation is philosophically important; for Merleau-Ponty, the criticism seemed to function like Husserl’s “phenomenological reduction,” and perhaps re-opened what Heidegger would call the question of being. \n\nYet while reading the book and the article I did not find an explicit claim against the negative, only an alternative idea that relates to the dualism of becoming from one original source - the elan vital - which in turn progresses to be two alternative sources.\n\nIs this the whole of the critique - that negation isn't created but is always present and comes in the form of continuing the dominant part of the creative force? Or is there something else which I am not aware of?\n\n(It should be noted that my knowledge of the hegelian dialectic is quite limited - my knowledge pretty much goes as far as the 'thesis-antithesis-synthesis' triad. I'm more interested in the Bergsonian point of view).",

However, i do tend to think that i have an agency, meaning that i can act on those choices, i can act on the background i have today and try shaping it in order to increase/decrease the chances of a future outcome.  \n\nToday i want to realize goal X, if i want to realize it it's not because i chose it independently (absence of free will), i was largely influenced by external and inner factors to strive for goal X. Now in my everyday life, i want to make a schedule of tasks that'll help me increase my chances to reach that goal, is doing so totally useless or does it play a role in changing \"the course of actions\"?",
