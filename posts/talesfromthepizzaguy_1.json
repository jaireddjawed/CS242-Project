        "text": "So I'm in my 20s and the other guy is in his 40s. Every day, he gets super upset and mumbles under his breath at the deliveries he isn't taking or something else. \nIn our store, who's name is on top takes the next delivery, or a two stop if it makes sense. \nHonestly, to me it doesn't matter as long as there is communication and no one is purposely being greedy. \nWhat I do care about is that he cares so much about getting the two stops or certain deliveries.\n\nToday there were 4 deliveries up, two one stops and one two stop.\nI see him going for the 2 stop which one of them is 7 orders after the one stop. (The one he should be taking)\nSo I said \"no you should be taking this one\" \n\nHe then started getting pissed, and said \"fine enjoy your two stop.\" Which I replied \"I'm gonna let you bag yours up, I don't want to be in your way\" \nBecause earlier he told me to \"get the fuck out of his way\" completely unprovoked although I was in his way.\nAfter I said that he goes, \"you better watch your fucking mouth or we can go outside and I'll fuck you up\" along with calling me a pussy and knocking my receipts to the ground, and a bunch more under his breath. This went on for a minute while I'm pretty calmly just telling him why he should be taking what he's taking, because I've been here for 5+ years.\n\n\nIdk it just kind of pisses me off when people are super greedy about deliveries like that. If he would've have asked me about it and was not rude to me earlier, I wouldn't have had an issue. But I'm not gonna fight someone over pizza deliveries..\n\n\nTldr: told a guy to take his actual delivery which was a one stop rather than a two stop, told me he was going to fuck me up in the parking lot.",

        "text": "* Delivering with a 2006 Saturn Vue which apparently gets 23 MPG on street roads (barely use highways). Parents usually take care of any maintenance issues. \n\n* Part-time working 20-25 hrs a week. I estimate i'm on the road for at least 18-20 of those hours.\n\n* Mileage is reimbursed $0.35 per mile\n\n* Generally poor area, so mostly $1-2 tips or no tips at all.\n\n* Usually work opening shift, so no real deliveries ordered until about a third into my shift.\n\n* We have a tip credit system. In store we get flat minimum wage ($8.60). On the road we get paid less than minimum wage at 7/hr. If we don't get enough tips to make at least 8.60/hr, they're obligated to pay us the difference.\n\n* Store is generally understaffed &amp; unorganized. No breaks during long shifts (for all positions, not just delivery), and no break laws in our state for people over 18.    EDIT: Yes I'm in the US. Federal Law doesn't require employers to provide employees breaks, they only require a break 20 minutes or under to be counted as paid time. Most states DO have laws that require employers to give breaks, but mine only requires breaks for people under 18 (Because adults don't need rest here, apparently.)\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo jobs like these usually not give any employees breaks? Am I shit out of luck to find a place that will give you one.\n\nThis is currently the only car I drive. Is the wear and tear on it worth the hours I work?\n\nEDIT: Had a really shitty day, so I'm extremely grateful for all the replies. Despite the lack of breaks, I do enjoy doing delivery (In a comfortable/familiar space, listening to music of my choice, etc). I can't stand the management here for reasons I won't get into, and I'm not making anywhere close to the tips mentioned in this thread per day (From my perspective right now, /u/Azerajin 's $100 a day, hell even $50 a day, sound like trolling if I didn't know any better.). I'm going to see if I can at least transfer to a better run store if I can't get night shifts.",

        "text": "Today, I had my second WORST delivery ever. The first was back when I started this job. I‚Äôve been working here for at least 2 months now and I feel like this FAIL was worse than the first.\n\nBefore this tragedy of a delivery happened, I was having a great day. Kinda stressful since we had so many deliveries, but still overall good UNTIL my last delivery that I took before I clocked out for the night.\n\nI went out on this delivery around 8:05ish. The customer was located about 10 minutes away from Pizza Hut. Part of me knew that this might not end well before I went out on this delivery because this was to one of the Trailer Parks. The customer wasn‚Äôt new, but I tend to have less luck in these trailer Parks because they are always so sketchy, it was PITCH BLACK NIGHT outside with no indication of which trailer park is in that area (there were 3), it was raining and they either rarely or never tip. The entire situation was doomed from the start basically.\n\nWhen I pulled up on the road for one of these trailer parks, I couldn‚Äôt see jack shit. And I just realized that the LOT number wasn‚Äôt on the receipt. So even if I was at the right trailer park, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to know which trailer it is. I then tried to call the customer to find out what LOT she is in: (no answer). So I just said screw it and went back to the store.\n\nTold my manager what happened, then she tried to call the customer. Out of the blue, now she decides to answer and told us what LOT she was in. Then I went back out. Remember that I said there was no way for me to tell if I was in the right trailer park because it was night time, on top of that it was raining and there was no other indication of where.\n\nI tried to test my luck again and call the customer, she actually answered. I explained to her that I was here but I couldn‚Äôt see a (for example) LOT #10. I was at LOT #8, 9 and 11 but #10 was no where to be found. Turns out, I was at the wrong Trailer Park.\n\nFast forward to around 8:50ish that night and I just found what road that she told me I need to go on. There was literally no way for me to see that road. Then she started complaining about she wants her wings to be free since it was a cash order because it took so long.\n\nAt this point, I wanted to just go off on her. She knew damn well it was DARK down here and was raining. Like, at least provide a note on the receipt or something. But it doesn‚Äôt end there. Since she wouldn‚Äôt pay, she got away with free wings since I was under so much stress before I went on this doomed delivery. I forgot to take the wings back before leaving that sketchy area that is deep into the wooded area.\n\nBy the time I got back to the store, it was a little past 9 PM aka I was off. I banked out, then clocked out. Hell, I actually like this job and I‚Äôm one of the quickest/best drivers at this store. HOWEVER, I clocked out and left the store with lightning speed because I just had enough of people for the day.\n\nAnd on top of all of that, I literally couldn‚Äôt speak right today. Throughout the entire conversation between me and the customer, I was stumbling heavy on my words because I was under so much stress from not only work but also school too since I‚Äôm in college also.\n\nYou know it was a bad day when you forgot to order pizza. Before coming into work today, I had intentions to get my free Personal Pan Pizza with my employee discount. But I just wanted to get the hell outta there and get home because I just had enough.",

I check this guy out and hear coins jingling in his bag. I look for our jar and it's not on the counter. I step around the counter and take the guy's bag of food, spill it on the counter, and the money from the coin jar comes out with his beef and fries. And, I see the coin jar is on the floor.\n\nThe guy is bitching the whole time, I'm yelling that he \"stole money from sick kids\" and told him to take his ass out of our shop. He grabs his food and runs out the door.\n\nI followed him as he gets in a car driven by his girlfriend and take down the plate number. We called the cops (who eat here for free when they are on duty and need a pizza fix), who later told us after they visited the sleezeball at his house, that his baby was in the backseat when he pulled this shit.\n\nThe cops told him he was banned from our shop, but since he didn't get away with the WHOLE $30+/- we recovered, no charges were filed.\n\nWhat a dope!\n\n",

I love it!\" Her dad walked up behind me and opened the door wider. As he did this, she screamed \"I'm free!\" and then ran out into the front yard and started doing cart wheels. I know some people might find that annoying but I found it hilarious. I gave her dad the food and said goodbye.\n\nA little bit later, I checked the app that manages all of our order info and I saw they gave me a $15 tip on a $60 order. Much better than what I usually get even from my good customers. It's little interactions like that that keep me sane during the long shifts.",

This one happened a little over a year ago, about a month after I started at one of the pizza places in town.\n\nI was in the middle of a closing shift, started running low on fuel (both gas and caffeine,) so I pulled into a gas station near the store to grab both. As I was walking up to the front, I noticed a mini-van parked next to the door with some very obviously drunk occupants, as one of them stumbled around the back holding onto the thing to keep his balance. Walking past the van, the man in the passenger seat called out to me. \n\nPassenger: Hey man, you like these? (holds up a light up fidget spinner)\n\nMe: I-I guess they‚Äôre alright?\n\nP: Wouldja suck a d*** for one?\n\nM: Uuuuh, I think I‚Äôll pass. \n\nP: Awh come on, boy, you got some purty lips.\n\nNope. Nope nope. I hauled ass inside, grabbed my items and went back outside, ignoring the Drunk Van as best I could. The passenger called out once more.\n\nP: HEY, you got any free pizza in there?\n\nWith a resounding NOPE as my only response, I slammed my car door as I heard more muffled yelling, and whipped out of the lot as quickly as I could. And then immediately started laughing about the absurdity of this town.",

Naturally I was pretty pissed that somebody placed such a stupid order so close to closing time.\n\nThen I looked at the receipt. It was to be delivered to fucking Domino's. I thought it was a prank at first, but they paid for it with their card and everything. Someone from Domino's actually had audacity to place an online delivery 20 minutes to close. Someone who works in the same exact industry and knows how fucking annoying it is when people do that.\n\nIt gets even better. I drive back to the store and the phone rings. It's fucking Domino's calling. I thought maybe they were just calling to thank us for making their order so good or something. Nope. We accidentally sprinkled a little parmesan on their bread and they didn't like it. They weren't allergic to dairy, they just didn't like it. So they demanded a new cajun bread be brought out to them. The guy goes \"I know how it is working in the food industry, it's not a big deal at all, but if you could send me a new bread that'd be great.\" he wouldn't let it go until my manager just caved and made him a new one.\n\nI drive back to Domino's with the new cajun bread (with no parmesan) and ask for the \"bad\" bread before handing over the new one. It's our store policy to only replace food if it hasn't been eaten yet. (we get a lot of scammers). This fucking man argued with me. He says \"that's weird... That's not how *we* do it...\" and proceeds to give me a hard time about it. I told him if he doesn't give me the shitty bread that was so shitty, he made me drive all the way back to bring him a new one, that I would not give him the new bread. He brought it to the counter and a little less than half was eaten. I took the bread and gave him the new one and left. This happened about an hour ago and I'm still aggravated.\n\nTLDR; Domino's ordered from us 20 minutes to close, complained about their food, made us bring them new food and didn't want to surrender the \"bad\" food.\n\nEdit: grammar",

        "text": "As the title states, a coworker of mine wants me and my fellow drivers to start sharing our tips with the kitchen crew. As it is now, we drivers make $2 per delivery plus tips, plus the $11/hour wage. The coworker suggested that we all give $1 of the $2 we make per delivery to the kitchen crew. Essentially this means that if I take 10 deliveries a day, I would give $10 dollars a day to the inside workers. I dont mind giving some of my tips to the coworkers who work hard and do a lot of the job making the pizzas and such. But I dont think that I should give a dollar per delivery to the kitchen staff. That might sound greedy, but please hear me out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. I dont make as much per hour as the people working inside. I might make more per hour if you count tips, but that's because I drive my car all night with the potential to either get in an accident or get robbed and killed. Hazard pay. Not to mention the wear and tear on my vehicle. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. When in-store, I work just as hard as the kitchen crew. I bus tables, make pizzas, do dishes, and anything else in between that needs doing. It's not like I take off on the road and get back and stand around. I do the same job as the inside crew when I can and make significantly less per hour. \n\n\n\n\n\n3. My boss will only give me so many hours. He hired too many drivers and as a result I only work 4 nights a week, about 5 hours each shift. My paycheck is already low, as I'm only getting 40 hours a pay period, and I've come to rely on my tips. Before now this hasn't been too much of a problem. I've been able to get by on wage+tips just fine. Giving up almost a full hour pay a night (I make $11 an hour so if I give $10 to the crew then I'm basically down an hours work) sets me back quite a bit in the long run. Which brings me to my final point. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. If I work 4 days a week and average 10 deliveries a night, that means I'm giving the inside crew $40 dollars a week, or $160 a month. Over the course of a year that's almost $2000. I'm 23 and I'm trying to go to college. That $2000 gets me at least one term in my local community college. I made $49 in tips tonight. If my coworker has his way then that would be $39. I dont mean to be greedy but that really adds up. \n\nI'm sorry for the long post, but if any of you guys read this then please chip in with some advice. Am I the asshole here for not wanting to spend ~2000 dollars a year to help out the inside crew instead of using it to further my own education?\n\n\nEdit: thank you all for not making me feel like a dick when I tell my coworker later today that I wont chip in like this. I'll update later after work to let you all know how it went. ",

        "text": "As we all know, pizza delivery can be a terrible, monotonous job where managers can be dicks, you can get mugged or even just stiffed by customers. But, my pizza experience was one of the best jobs, over all, that I ever had. I assume because the work environment was laid back, the manager was also part owner and most of the people I worked with were also degenerate lowlifes, like myself. We had a lot of fun there. \n\nThere were times that there would be fistfights (and one of our drivers maced another one night, but that‚Äôs a different story), but most of the time, any grief we have each other was lighthearted and fun. The best pranks I‚Äôve ever pulled or seen pulled were at my pizza job. I‚Äôm not sure how common this is in the pizza industry, but I had to share my favorite pizza prank. \n\nThis is how to Dough Lock somebody.\n\nNow, first of all, I believe that a prank shouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone or destroy property, but inconvenience is totally fine!\n\nIt‚Äôs gotta be a hot night, high humidity works best. Keep an ear out for a driver that‚Äôs complaining about running low on gas and strike while the driver is back at the store, in between runs, just after filling up. Take a small amount of dough (as I remember, I usually used about 1/8 of a doughball meant for a large) and roll it into a snake, just like you used to do with play-doh when you were a kid. Go out to the drivers car, open the gas tank lid (NOT THE GAS CAP) and wrap your dough snake around the gas cap. Then close the lid. If it‚Äôs done right, the dough will proof, expand and then harden around their gas cap, making it a GIANT pain in the ass to get their gas cap off the next time they have to fill up. Make sure you do it right after they get gas, so there‚Äôs the longest possible amount of time between fillups, if they find it early, it‚Äôs still funny, but it‚Äôll be gooey instead of crumbly.  It doesn‚Äôt destroy anything, but it makes a bit of a mess. \n\nLike I said, you have to be at a store where some good hearted ribbing is appreciated, first! Make sure you‚Äôre not really pissing someone off before you do it, or make sure it‚Äôs a guy that already doesn‚Äôt like you. I don‚Äôt want anyone getting fired or sued over this! \n\n",

I thought I‚Äôd give y‚Äôall another glimpse into my time at Shmapa Shmohn‚Äôs. \n\nIt was either a Friday or Saturday night, so we were super busy, as usual. In addition to assembling pizza, I was given the super fun task of taking phone orders. I get the usual calls, people with such bad Mountain Dew mouth I can hardly understand them, people who have no idea how cooking time and delivery time works, people who are trying to con me into to giving them free pizza even though it‚Äôs painfully obvious they‚Äôre lying.\n\nBut then the first prank call comes. \nI answer, ‚ÄúHi! Thanks for calling *pizza place* my name is dianechoksondik, how may I help you?‚Äù, trying to smile through the phone so the customer knows how f***ing ecstatic I am to be taking their order. \n\nAll I hear on the other end is dead silence and then heavy breathing. \n‚ÄúHello‚Äù I say again, thinking maybe they hadn‚Äôt heard me, but there was nothing. Just heavy breathing. I chalk it up to a prank call, so I hang up and go about my business. \n\nPhone rings again, so I pick it up, give my usual spiel, and again, there‚Äôs nothing on the other end. I hang up. Of course the phones continue to ring, and I get several actual orders. I answer the phone, and once again, there is only heavy breathing. \n\nNow I‚Äôm starting to lose my patience at this point. We were busy, and I had a lot to do without dealing with some creepy little kid who didn‚Äôt know when to stop, but knowing full well that I‚Äôd get in trouble for calling them out, I never let the person on the other end know I was fed up. I just continued to answer and hang up. \n\nThis cycle continued throughout the night. They must have called at least 20 times during my 4 hour shift. Finally, about 20 minutes from close, I answer the phone and a kid asks for a large cheese. I type in the order. When I ask if he wants any toppings, he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like some boogers on it please‚Äù. And then he starts hysterically laughing and hangs up. To be honest, I thought it was kind of funny, and it definitely brightened my day. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if he was the one calling earlier, and maybe he just got stage fright or something, or if that was totally unrelated. Either way, it was one of many interesting nights spent at that job. ",

We had ppl lined up out into the street and so many orders we had 3 people going in and out of the shop constantly. So naturally, a lot of orders would take awhile as we had to do the others before it.\n\nSo, 8pm. I was taking a pizza out to this old couple. I could hear them arguing, the husband was pissed as it took an hour and a half to get their pizza out to them, the wife was telling him to calm down and not to yell at me cos it wasn't my fault. Well as soon as i handed it over he went off. Swearing at me, saying he can't wait for us to go out of business, calling us \"dog cunts\" and whatnot (typical Australian insult) \n\nI know i shouldn't have engaged, but he was already insulting me, the shop and outright threatening me, saying if his wife wasn't here he'd shoot me, and he'd do it if i ever came back (which would only happen if they ordered from us again) so i just looked him in the eyes, with a faint smile and said \"... enjoy your pizza\" and i walked away. Make no mistake, i did it to taunt him. He was yelling after me, hurling insults, referring to me as a \"filthy mongrel\" and a criminal, i was responded with \"yeah yeah whatever\" \n\nLong story short we're not delivering to them anymore. They're banned for life. They said they can't wait for a franchise to open in town to drive us out of business, this town barely has the population to keep a McDonalds open, and we're profitable cos we have a large established base of regulars in town. So yeah, that ain't happening any time soon. \n\nFuck these people. ",

Naturally, the management checked with the police to see if the story was true; it was not. As it turns out, the driver had spent that time having sex with the customer, as though she had a fetish for pizza guys. It's like a bad porno come to life, and I still cannot believe someone who should have known better did this. Best part is, the shift leader at the time said he would have covered for the guy if he was getting some, but they had to fire him for lying in away that could be disproven.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: There is no moral to this story. It doesn't have a happy ending. I'm not claiming the high ground and I'm not here for a lecture. This story is simply for entertainment. I have my perspective, as I'm sure he had his. However, I am open to consolation, particularly in the form of sweet, sweet upvotes. I will do my best to portray this story as accurately and objectively as possible. To protect the customer's identity, I have decided to use the neutral moniker of Fuck Face for him. I work at one of the big 3. Again, to protect the identity of the company in question, I will hereon refer to it as Shitminos.\n\nNow, some backstory: I've been working at Shitminos for the past 2 1/2 years. It has never been good or fun. I fucking hate it. The only reason I got the job was to pay off my car, which I have now done. I put in my 2 weeks last week and have decided not to take shit from these Fuck Faces who try to make my life miserable. Stiffers, bad customers, etc. I hate them and I'm not hiding it anymore. So last night...\n\nFuck Face orders a pizza with no garlic oil. Well that shit is hard to see, so usually, at my Shitminos, someone will highlight the tag all over, so it's noticeable. We live in a fast paced world, and since my second closing driver quit last week, I've been working alone. So I didn't see the no garlic oil and put it on there, because it wasn't highlighted. Whoops. I deliver the pizza to Fuck Face and he looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Man, these delivery fees keep going up. It's killing your tips.\" He proceeds to write a line in the tip and smiles at me.\n\nSarcastically, I reply, \"Sorry about that. Thanks.\" I wasn't subtle.\n\nI hand Fuck Face his food and go to my car. He suddenly yells, \"HEY! There's fucking GARLIC OIL on my pizza!\"\n\nI look back, decide it isn't worth it, and head to my car. I could say I was uncomfortable, because he sounded threatening, but really, I just didn't give a fuck. Not when he swore at me. As I pull out of the drive way, he approaches my car and I think to myself oh fuck no. He stands in front of my car, so I can't leave. I stop. He heads to my driver's side window, so I do the only thing a red-blooded American can, and I bolt. He proceeds to physically assault my car (I don't know with what and there was no damage).\n\nOf course, he called the store. When I get back, the manager is offering to send me out with a free pizza. I interrupt him to say I will not be going out there. I explain what happened and the manager agrees with me. He's a good manager. So Fuck Face comes to the store and proceeds to berate me in front of the kind old lady waiting for her pizza. Among his best insults was calling me a \"weenie.\" Good one, Fuck Face. He then tells the manager how unprofessional he is and how he should be doing this and that and asking Fuck Face to wait outside(?). At this point, I'm two seconds from grabbing my sign and leaving for good. But let's face it, I'm too much of a bitch to do that.\n\nThen, he accuses me of trying to run him over, to which I reply, \"Don't even try to play that card, I waited until you were at my window to leave.\"\n\nHe tells me to shut the fuck up. Then he says, \"What? Got nothing to say?\" I sarcastically remark that he JUST told me to shut up. Then he corrects himself, saying I clearly drove around him. He spouts on about working 15 hours a day (big fucking deal, I was on hour 13 at the time). Anyway, the manager finally gets his corrected pizza and Fuck Face leaves. Then, he puts a note in his account to not give him free food, because this is not the first time he's made a scene.\n\nNow, listen here, kids. I was clearly a dick to him. But you know what? This guy was a dick first. I wasn't going to take it from him. I was laughing my ass off as I drove away from him, because fuck that guy. You reap what you sow. \"You better fire him!\" Well guess what, Fuck Face? I didn't get fired. I wasn't even disciplined. I wasn't even talked to. My manager was completely on my side. In fact, you only got *yourself* one step closer to a ban.\n\nSo I guess there is a happy ending. And there's a moral, too: customers have so much less power than they think. Go ahead and be a dick. It's not going to benefit you. Nobody's getting fired for you. So fuck you and have a good night. I can't wait to never step foot in that shit hole again.\n\nTLDR; Fuck you, Fuck Face.",

        "text": "Before I start the story, don't forget about our discord! we haven't posted the link in a while so I thought I'd take the opportunity to beforehand: https://discord.gg/CrGmDrt \n\nThis is a fun little story about a delivery I had on a pretty shitty Friday night. We were very busy and I was one of two drivers, which is not good. I was coming off of a few stiffs in a row when this web order pops up for one sandwich. We were all taking doubles on every run but I had to deliver one sandwich to a bad part of our delivery area. Our delivery minimum is $10 before the delivery fee and tax, however, our online system doesn't recognize that, so I've taken crazy low orders before, this was one of those times.\n\n I walk up to the rotting porch and greet the man with a \"Hello Sir\" and see a typical native of my small town. Slightly older, not intelligent sounding, smells a little, you know the type, he said \"It took you a long time.\" and doesn't look at me. \"Sorry about that, I'm one of two drivers tonight. Your total is $9.69\" The man hands me two dollar bills and 69 cents in mixed change. The man then picks up a dish from a table he is sitting at and hands me a tray full of nickles.\n\n I've never seen such a large concentration of nickels before. I had many questions that I asked myself internally, like why does this man have these nickels, how did he acquire them, why did he decide to do this to me, do I count them? I decided to not count them and just go on with my night. The contents were 7 dollars in nickles.  I picked up the dish to dump the contents into my pocket. the man says \"I need that dish back.\" as I wrap up getting all of these damn nickles in my pocket. \"No problem sir.\" I hand the man the dish and say \"Have a good night.\" I then continue my terrible night.

        "text": "A couple things from the start:\nI drive my own car.\nI live in California and therefore make full minimum wage ($11)\nI do expect tips from customers because I drive my own car and this sort of job puts a lot of wear on your car.\nOur store closes at 10 and we stop taking delivery orders at 9:30.\n\nTonight I came into work for a normal 5-9:30 shift. Since it was a Monday and Mondays are generally slow at our store there was only myself and one other driver scheduled for the evening shift. I get there to find out that my fellow driver, the closing driver for the night, had a flat tire on his car. Since he couldn't drive his car he brought his Grandma's car to work. Unfortunately his Grandma's car isn't registered with the store's insurance which is a must for all cars since we drive our own. Him and our manager tried to get it approved in time but the insurance place was already closed I guess. All of this means that my coworker, the closing driver, wouldn't be able to take any deliveries for the night. Since there would be no way for me to take all the deliveries my manager asked our morning driver to stay until his 8 hours which would be until 7.\n\nFor this first couple hours where it was the two of us driving it was pretty okay. Decent amount of deliveries for a Monday. At 7 he goes home and things are already starting to slow down, fairly typical. At this point we're getting about 1 delivery every half hour which is more than manageable for just myself. The problem comes when it gets a bit later. Just after 9pm we get a delivery. Annoying but its whatever, I have to stay until at least 9:30 anyway since the closing driver can't take any deliveries and that's when we stop delivering. Since this delivery was taken somewhat late we decided not to put it in right away and wait until close to 9:30 just in case anybody else makes an order for delivery. Then at 9:28 as I am bagging up my delivery I see my coworker taking a delivery order and my heart drops as I see that its to the neighboring town. Our store is at the edge of our town and we deliver to the neighboring one which is about 5 miles away. Unfortunately for me the delivery is also the opposite direction of the one I'm about to take so they can't even go together. I hurry out the door to get to the first delivery just to get stiffed. Typical, very few people seem to tip after 9pm in my area, but I am a bit frustrated about this considering that at this point its about 9:45 and they didn't even turn on their outside light. \n\nI go back to the store to pick up the final delivery of the night and once I have it I make my way to the next town over. At this point its a little after 10pm and I'm pretty done with the whole shift, I mean I was supposed to be off at 9:30 and if it were a normal Monday where the closing driver was actually driving then I probably would have been able to leave at 8pm. This particular customer is one that I have never been to and its in the somewhat not-so-good part of the neighboring town. I find the house, which btw had no address on it and didn't have a working outside light and was on a street without street lights. I get to the door the guy takes a minute to answer but finally does and he is stoned. We exchange the normal small talk and then I read him his total: $31.78. \n\nHe grabs his wallet and looks in it then looks back to me and says \"do you have change?\"\nMe: Yeah... well change for what, exactly? (I had enough for a couple 20s or a 50)\nCustomer: 100\n\nAt this point im screaming internally. There was no way that I was getting jammed this hard at 10:20 on a night where I wasn't even closing and was supposed to be home already. \n\nMe: I don't think so, but let me check.\n\nI grab my money pouch and go through it quickly taking out all of the cash in it. I count up the cash and it adds up to about $38 (most of my deliveries for the night were credit card and we only start with $20 in change).\n\nMe: No I don't have change for 100. Are you sure you don't have two 20s?\nCustomer: Nah I only have a single 20. I didn't realize that I only had the 100 to pay with until after I had already ordered. I guess I should have called back.\nMe (internally): Yeah You should have. \nMe: Well would you be able to pay by card? I can call the store back.\n\nThe customer turns around for a second then turns back saying no that wouldn't work.\n\nMe: Well shit.\nCustomer: I'm sorry man, is there anything we can do?\nMe: I mean I can go get change for this\nCustomer: That could work, but I don't want you to run off with my money.\nMe: You don't have to worry about that. My job knows who I am and they know who you are and if I don't give you any change then theyll track me down. I might be able to go to the corner store and break the 100.\nCustomer: Alright, then I guess that could work. You're really not gonna run off with my money?\nMe: No I'm not (fake laughing)\n\nSo I take the 100 and give him his order and tell him that I should be back soon. As I get to my car I realize that that corner store doesn't accept 100s. Jammed. I decide that I'll drive home and get change because it is closer than driving back to my work to get change. From this point things go relatively normally. I bring the change back and then go back to the store. When I arrive at the store it is 10:45 and apparently my coworkers have been done for 20 minutes and the closing driver already left (because theres no reason to keep 4 on the clock when 3 are literally sitting doing nothing). I hand my manager my money to be counted out and tell them the whole story. Then my other coworker leaves because he also has nothing to do (there has to be 2 people at the store during closing for safety reasons) and so it is just me and my manager while I wait for him to count me out and then close the register. We ended up leaving at 11pm and I basically got a closing shift which I have made clear to our scheduling manager that I do not want closing shifts mostly because shit like this happens every time. In addition to this it was a 6 hour shift and since I wasn't expected to work past 9:30 (4.5 hours) I didn't even take a break (In CA you have to take at least a 20 minute break if you work more than 5 hours). \n\nSo now here I am after this terrible shift having made $34 in tips from 8 deliveries and we make $2 in gas compensation per delivery, which really means that I only made $18 in actual tips for the whole night. To top it off, the guy from the last delivery tipped me a dollar.\n\nShit night, shit tips. I got jammed hard.\n\n",

We used to be that super cheap spot that had huge portions, and now were expensive AF.

        "text": "This story has quite a bit of detail to it but I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Hopefully anyone who delivers can learn something from my story. This is 100% true.\n\nI delivered for a large pizza chain for a few months in the town I live in. Near the end of May I went into work one evening and left on a delivery. During the course of the delivery I realized that I left a bottle of hot sauce at home that I intended to bring to work. After delivering the order I was on the way back to the store when I decided to stop at my house to get the bottle of hot sauce. The road my house is on runs parallel to the road leading back to the store so my house is literally 20 yards off the delivery course. As I turned onto my road I noticed there was a brilliant sunset and I decided to take a picture of it. While driving slowly, 15-20mph, I stuck my phone out the window and snapped 3 pictures of it. I proceeded to my house just 50 yards away and stopped in my driveway. I went inside, got my hot sauce, hugged my wife, and walked out the door. Once I get off my porch and I'm approaching my truck I looked up and saw a rather rough looking disgruntled character approaching me from a vehicle. I opened the door to my truck and set the hot sauce on my seat just in time for this creepy dude to walk around the door of my truck. I asked him what he wanted and he asked why I was taking pictures just down the road... I basically said I was taking pictures of the sunset, what is it to you? He said that was bullshit, that I was actually taking pictures of his dad's house to which I replied why the hell would I take a picture of your dad's house... he told me to show him the photos. I told him I was not obligated to show him anything but just to put his mind at ease I agreed to show him the pictures. As I bring up the photos his demeanor immediately changed. He poked his finger into the bottom of my phone screen and angrily said \"that's my dad's place, you better erase that right now\", I replied with \"fuck off and get off my property\" before he moved away a couple steps and plunged his hand into his pocket. I noticed several pre-attack indicators and turned away from him to conceal my draw and get my hand on the concealed Glock 27 I had in my waistband. As I got my shirt untucked he pulled his hand out of his pocket and unfolded a knife while coming toward me. As soon as he started reaching toward me with the knife I pulled my gun from its holster and poked him firmly in the abdomen with it. He didn't even realize I had the pistol until I told him to back up or I'd shoot him. He looked down at the pistol and kind of tried to grab at it before jumping back and yelling at me telling me he'd kill me. I was yelling at him too... it was a really intense moment and I don't understand at all why he was still yelling at me when I had a loaded handgun pointed right at his face. He decided to retreat back to the vehicle where he had some tweaked out female waiting to drive him away. As they pulled away I dialed 911 and gave the license plate number, make, model, and color of the vehicle, a description of the people etc. to dispatch. The police showed up at my house and I described the incident in detail to them. One asked me \"why didn't you shoot him, I would have\" another one responded \"it would have been justified\". I was well aware of that honestly. He presented a deadly threat... I was scared but I'm just glad I had my gun.. I did hesitate to shoot him, I think I was waiting to actually feel the knife touch my skin, which it never did. I went back to work, informed them of what happened and they kept me there for a few minutes before the police called me and asked me to come to the PD to identify the guy. The license plate led police to the females address where they fled to after the incident. She turned out to be his girlfriend. He was arrested on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and battery. I positively idendified him and he was taken to jail and they refused to let him bond out. I discovered that he raped a 6 year old girl in 1989. He was convicted in 2002 and was released from prison in 2014. His father is also a pedophile. The only reason I can think that he freaked about me taking pictures near his dads house is because they are both on the local sex offender registry and their addresses etc. are listed there. He thought I was trying to take a picture of the local sex offenders house or something. Anyway, went to court and testified on the stand and yet again they denied him bond and pushed the case over to district court. He tried claiming that I pulled the gun on him first... because that's just what you do when someone has a gun pointed at you, you pull a knife on them üôÑ. Went to his arraignment and he plead not guilty so we'll see what happens. He's still in jail. Lost my job over all of it. \n\nQuestions and comments welcome.",

Cant say I'm surprised since the guy was a total asshole and had the people skills of a spoiled child. \n\nWe're a corporate \"Big 3\" store and they've given us basically no direction other than we'll promote someone in a few weeks; do your best until then and we'll decide based on the best performer. \n\nNow there are like 5 assistant managers all vying for control. Each of them keeps changing the schedule so that way it looks like the other doesnt show up to work on time. This has resulted in other people not showing up, being overstaffed at times and hardly anyone there when we get SLAMMED. \n\nOne intentionally screwed up an order (while logged in as the person they are trying to screw over) hoping that the customer would complain and we'd see the person who entered it incorrectly to get them in trouble. \n\nOne of the managers gave me a triple (something we're expressly NOT ALLOWED to do basically ever) in a super inefficient route pattern. It took more than an hour to deliver them when usually our runs are 15 minutes ot less. Unsurprisingly, customers called to complain about the wait and I got stiffed. I came back to see who dispatched me, and the person who did it (one of the managers not trying to be full blown Cersi) said she did not dispatch me at all- someone must have logged in as her.\n\nThe GM position gets a huge pay bump so on one hand I kind of get it, but its annoying as shit and its costing me money. There has been massive turnover since I started so I'm already one of the most senior non managers- each one keeps trying to get me to play the role of Varys and advise them/get me to conspire against another one. Lol fuck that.\n\nShould I complain to corporate about it? Quit? Its been more than a week of this. ",

I round a corner and a man with a dog is in the middle of the street and he jogs to the side and I pass. I could have been going 20mph and had the same thing happen, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. A few hours later while clocking out my manager tells me she got a call that I was speeding so fast through a neighborhood the guy had to run to the side with his dog so I wouldn't hit him. He threatened to call the cops if nothing was done and that he has my tag number (even though I have a temporary tag and the numbers are miniscule). My manager told me she asked the GM about it and that if it happens again I have to be terminated. So I got written up and the guy made it sound like I'm going 40 in his neighborhood and almost killed him.",

I took a woman's order over the phone but I accidentally punched black olives instead of green olives into the order screen. The pizza was made according to the order I put in and her husband, Joe, picked up the order so no one knew that a mistake had been made. Also, our call display hasn't been working  and even though I ask for a phone number for delivery orders I sometimes forget and only ask for a name for carry-out orders. Her order was just under the name Joe, no phone number.  About ten minutes after her husband left the woman called me back, super pissed.\n Me = me AL = Angry Lady\n\nMe: Thank you for calling...blah blah customary phone greeting etc.\n\nAL: Yes, you need to put a credit on my account for the next time I order cause you fu**ed up my pizza!\n\nMe: Oh I'm so sorry, ma'am can you tell me what the problem was?\n\nAL: I asked for green olives and you idiots gave me black ones.\n\nMe: (sheepishly remembering taking her order and that she had indeed asked for green olives) Oh yes I remember your order, I can fix that right away.  Could I get your phone number?\n\nAL: (shouts numbers slowly and very condescendingly)\n\nI  enter the numbers into the system but I have no order attached to that number at all, not realizing right away that I had put the order in without a phone number.\n\nMe: I'm sorry I don't have an order for that number is there any chance it was placed using a different number \n\nAL: Oh. My. God. Try this one (shouts more numbers at me) \n\nI try again but still no order is coming up. I start manually going through the last few orders on my screen and sure enough it finally dawns on me that her order was just Joe-no number. I find the order and discover it was entered incorrectly, thus my fault .\n\nMe: Sorry about that, I've found it now and it seems it was entered incorrectly. I can get a new pizza made for you with green olives and sent to your house, no charge. Or if you would rather I can have a coupon for a free pizza mailed to you for next time.\n\nAL: (exasperated sigh) It's too late for a new pizza, I want a credit on my account.\n\nMe: Unfortunately, I have no way to put a credit on your account, but I can have a coupon for a free pizza mailed out as quickly as possible, usually takes a couple of days to get there.\n\nAL: (exasperated sigh) ughhhh fine.\n\nMe: So I'll just need your phone number again to pull up your address in the system\n\nAL: ughhhh I just gave it to you\n\nMe: Um, yeah sorry I just had to go through some different screens to get to your order and now I need to input it again, I'm so sorry for the hassle (trying to so hard to stay positive)\n\nAL: (shouts angry numbers very slowly)\n\nThe phone number pulls up an account with an address listed with it.\n\nMe: Okay, I have 33 Street Street as your listed address and the postal code is X1X2X2\n\nAL: Oh. My. God! No, that's not my postal code!\n\nMe: Oh, again sorry it's just the postal code that came up in the system. Could I please have your postal code?\n\nAL: ughhhhh it's X2X1X1\n\nMe: Ok no problem, I will change that right now and we will send out a coupon to that address for a free pizza.\n\nAL: ughhhhh do you have to mail it??\n\nMe: Um, yeah, unfortunately I have no other way to credit you. The manager needs to fill out and mail all the coupons but it should only take a few days.\n\nAL: And who am I speaking to??\n\nMe: (gives her my name)\n\nAL: And if don't have a coupon by the end of the week, I'm calling back! \n\nAnd she abruptly hangs up. Like wow, I get that I made a mistake but this lady was acting like I spit on her pizza and then rubbed her face in it. Calm down lady, they're just olives! ",

        "text": "There is this customer I seem to have made an impression on years ago who has slowly become obsessed with me over the years I have worked at my store. I've been working at the same store over 3 and a half years now to give an idea of a timeline of how much time the events elapsed over.\n\nBackstory\n\n¬†So it all began one day when I answered the phone on a slow day shift and there was a guy asking for me so having nothing much else to do I let him know he was talking to me. He then asks me if I believe in Santa and is offering me part time work. The job would be to take him out during the holiday season to look at lights, maybe watch a movie, get dinner, do Christmas shopping, ect. At this moment I am thinking maybe my parents let someone from church know of my workplace in order to offer me relatively easy part time work and keep them company during the holiday season, cool. I politely decline since I am already getting as many hours as I want, but let the guy know my little brother might be interested though since he loves Christmas and doesn't have a job at the moment to which he is disappointed and now I'm getting off the phone with him because orders are starting to come in again. \n\nLater that night I get home and ask my dad if anyone has asked him about needing someone to keep them company and help them do Christmas related things recently.... to which he replies no.... now I'm curious where this guy came from. Later the guy calls my house(yup stupidly I gave him my home number to inquire about my brother) asking about my brother and my dad picks up and talks to the guy. My dad has a conversation with the guy and thinks he is a bit weird and/or might be a sex offender so things kinda end for the guys plans of finding a Christmas chauffeur. My dad then tells me the guys nickname is \"caveman\" because he is a bit of a recluse and has no kids or immediate family to speak of to visit him. He also mentions about where he lives so now I ask a few more questions and pinpoint about where he lives and figure out who it is based on the regular customers we have. At this point I realize he is an older guy I deliver to that is on oxygen over in some apartments off of \"seamist drive\"(that's what I'll refer to it as) and he is probably just lonely.\n\nSo after neither my brother(who worked at the same store later) or I will drive him around he calls the store back regularly and the owner eventually ends up being the one who picks up. After this the owner(partially joking around and poking fun at me) tells me about this guy who orders and every time won't stop about oh Eli Eli Eli, and keeps asking for me to deliver. Next time I'm on shift I the guy orders and asks for me to deliver it and even though it's my turn I get the owner to take it instead of me since he knows the situation. He ends up getting held up for about 20 minutes by the guy who asks him to give me a kiss for him, to which the owner gives him some sort of sarcastic response along the lines of do it yourself. \n\nOne of the next times I deliver to the guy as I'm reaching for the money on the counter he goes for my hand and then i quickly grab the money and retract my hand and I see he has the school girl type of smirk on his face. So now I'm getting really uncomfortable at this point with this guy. Later i find out he also asked another driver to give me a kiss for him to which the other driver basically says for the right tip he will and the guy tries to kiss him and he quickly gets away trying to explain he is joking (he is from a another country, English is his 3rd language so his sense of humor is a bit odd to some.) So I pretty much avoid this guy at all costs if possible.\n\nTonight \n\nSo tonight a delivery comes in and I see it's to seamist drive and is some variation of an extra large pepperoni pizza to apartment 14... oh boy that guy again and it's my turn and the other driver is out on delivery. So I take the delivery and arrive and this time the guy is wearing something that I would describe as like a hospital gown crossed with a poncho and no pants and says the usual \"come in\". So I wait for him to go behind his counter like usual and go take the money off the counter where he usually puts it and hand him his pizza all the while keeping my head down not wanting to look at him, but while this is going on he asks me \"does Eli still work there\" now I'm kinda surprised and after a moment answer \"yeah he does\" to which he responds \"that's my boy\" now even more surprised after a few more moments I reply \"now why is that?\" He kinda scoffs saying \"don't you see the resemblance\" now at this point I'm laughing to myself because he doesn't recognize me anymore(I stopped wearing glasses all the time and grew a beard) look him in the eyes and leave saying have a nice evening. When I get back to the store I update my coworkers on the most events with the guy to which the other driver tells me the guy won't shut up about me when he delivers to him and that the guy keeps telling him that I'm the guys son.\n\nTldr: A guy in his late 40's or early 50's always asks for me and seems to have made a pass at me. Also he has asked my coworker (38ish guy) to give me a kiss and my coworker jokingly said he would for the right tip so the guy actually started to lean in to which my coworker get out of there in a hurry. Now the guy is telling people I'm his son.",
