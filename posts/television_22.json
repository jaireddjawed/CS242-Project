She didn‚Äôt really have too many options in terms of suitors. But in fact, the whole ending puzzled me...\n\n  Why did either Wang Yu or Ki have to die, the former‚Äôs death being the only way to save Ki? Everyone seemed to accept this without question ‚Äì even Wang Yu who, on being told it, just said ‚ÄúOK, kill me then‚Äù and stood there allowing the emperor to drive his sword through him. And Ki too just accepted it when she heard of Wang Yu‚Äôs death.\n\n  If it was so obvious, why did he leave in the first place ‚Äì he wasn‚Äôt stupid, he would have known. The implication is that it was solely down to the emperor‚Äôs jealousy, in which case I can‚Äôt fathom why Ki accepted it so readily, even talking it a sign of his deep love for her and then declaring her love for him! He had no redeeming qualities whatsoever ‚Äì it‚Äôs really stretching the imagination to think she‚Äôd fall for him.!&lt;\n\n  The whole ending was a bit rushed ‚Äì which has little excuse in a 51 episode series - but that aside, it was a fun romp to sit through for the most part. I almost didn‚Äôt watch it, thinking it‚Äôd be too full of political intrigue for a non-Korean speaker to get to grips with, but in fact that side of it was all pretty straightforward, and as a swashbuckling romantic adventure it was entertaining enough. 4/5.",

The character development is good, and Ellie and Joel definitely have very good chemistry and the actors are doing a great job.\n\nHowever there hasn't been any extremely thrilling or grandiose moment, the stakes do not feel very high somehow.

The 65-year-old actor, whose real name is Tracy Lauren Marrow, was joined by his wife Coco Austin and their daughter Chanel Nicole at the ceremony held on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The event was attended by many stars, including fellow rappers Chuck D and Ice Cube, and Law &amp; Order franchise creator Dick Wolf. Ice-T's Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit co-star Mariska Hargitay spoke at the ceremony, praising the actor's humanity and artistry.*\n\n## The Meaning Behind the Ceremony\n\nMariska Hargitay reflected on the significance of having a place on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which, she said, meant different things to different people. However, she held it dear to her heart because her star would be next to her mother's. She said that Ice-T's name being on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was profoundly right as it recognized his friendship and achievements in the entertainment industry. The star is located at 7065 Hollywood Boulevard, and it is the 2,747th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n## Mariska Hargitay Pays Tribute to Ice-T's Artistry and Humanity\n\nMariska Hargitay gave a touching speech at the ceremony, reflecting on Ice-T's artistry and humanity. She said that he was the O.G. of friendship and the real deal, with a story that shaped how he viewed the world. Instead of hardening him beyond recognition, the story filled him with humanity, humility, grace, and wisdom. She went on to talk about the wonderful friendship that they shared, which was the reason that she loved him. Hargitay praised Ice-T for his dedication to his family and the fact that he is a devoted husband and father.\n\n## Ice-T's Career as a Rapper and Actor\n\nIce-T's career as a rapper began to rise in the 1980s, and he released his debut album, Rhyme Pays, in 1987, followed by the album Power the following year. He introduced his new band, Body Count, on one track of the successful album O.G. in 1991 before releasing a debut LP with the group the following year. Body Count was an influential part of hip-hop's merger with heavy metal, and Ice-T was a fan of this subgenre. In recent years, Ice-T has been better known for his acting career, particularly his role in Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, where he has played Detective Odafin Tutuola for over 20 years.\n\n## ---\n\n*The ceremony was a significant event in Ice-T's life, and it recognized his achievements and contributions to the entertainment industry. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an iconic symbol of the entertainment industry, and the ceremony provided the opportunity to reflect on its meaning and significance. The speeches given by Ice-T's friends and colleagues, particularly Mariska Hargitay, highlighted the importance of friendship and the impact that Ice-T has had on their lives.*",
