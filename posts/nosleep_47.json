        "text": "My name is Andalayah De'Count. And I am a vampire. I was born this way and it's all I have ever known. My favorite song is, \"The Devil wears a suit and tie\", by Colter Wall. I love his voice and his music so much. I am also a legacy admission to the school I go to. I won't be naming the school directly but you won't need to know it anyways. I am one of four, \"legacy kids\", at the school, who are from families a lot like my own. Little known fact, in the world of myths and monsters, there are currently four ruling families, and they have been in their perspective places for thousands of years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family has been at the tippy top of the vampire power structure from the very beginning. My grandmother, the matriarch of the family, still hasn't told me many of the oldest stories about our family. But this year I will learn much more than I have already. And next year even more than this year, and so on, and so on it goes. And one day I expect it will be me that sets at the top of our little family tree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my two best friends is another of the, \"Legacy Four\", here at the university. I call him Bug, but his real name is Abraham Jann. His family is from the middle-east originally. He is what you would call a Jinn, and no he won't grant you three wishes. There are many different types of Jinn, as he would tell you himself. And for what it's worth, his greatest secret, is that he is pretty sure he is gay. I've told him time and time again that doesn't matter much anymore. But I guess in his family it certainly does. I'll never understand why but to each their own I suppose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second best friend is Ralphie, Raphaël Indalecio. He is the same age as I am and he is also a vampire. Though his family is rich, they are not quite as influential as my family is in our world. And the other two legacy kids here at school, are both kids that I've met many times before, and known whilst growing up. But we are not nearly as close as I am with Bug and Ralphie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the two is, George Herbert Franklin IV, as a kid I called him Franky Four. The name still makes me crack a smile when I think of it. He is the picture of perfection and popularity you would expect from a family such as his. Mega rich, both physically and genetically enhanced, a model of peak physical condition, tall, handsome, and smart as a whip. He drives an Aston Martin supercar that is a one of a kind. His father had it built for him for his 16th birthday, and it was designed by Marek Paul Reichman himself. He loves to show off and show out, and he's also a star athlete. As a first year student he is already captain of the men's rowing team. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd last but not least, Corrin Alexander. He is an only son and has three younger sisters. He is a lycanthrope, born to transform and tough as they come. He's kind of got a bad boy edge about him. I have always thought that he had a crush on me, but a relationship between the two of us would be totally forbidden from both our families, without a doubt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now that I have caught you up on all of that I want to tell you about the gathering tonight..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight is the night that we celebrate our positions, and we will be gathered together in chambers for the very first time. We will be given tasks, to compete and complete on school grounds, and we will have ceremonies to perform per our traditions. It's the most important night in the life of a legacy first year like myself and the others. Our families and others will be represented, by the most important figures, members, and heads of their respective families. We have never been in chambers before. And there is no way to know when the festivities will begin. The only thing I do know for sure is we will likely all be drugged and taken from our rooms. Only to awaken shortly thereafter in coffin-like vessels before our hooded and robed council leaders and family members.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll keep you all updated as things unfold. But before tonight gets interesting I think I will feed my fill. I want to be in peak form for the night ahead. And I will definitely need the extra energy and strength to beat the rest at whatever games have been planned ahead of us. The night is young and now it's time to go out on the prowl, I just saw a sweet little thing leave the dormitory alone. She wont even know what hit her, or bit her, till its far too late to scream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm walking behind her now on a dark tree lined path. There couldn't be any more perfect of an opportunity before me. My senses are amazing and I can tell there isn't anyone else out and about close enough to matter. I'll have to get rid of her after but that wont be much of a chore either. She has looked back a couple of times, but her guard isn't up, after all, what harm is just another girl from campus. Give me just a second while I take care of this sweet little morsel. I'll post this afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh my that was a delicious treat, I didn't realize how badly I needed to feed, the day has gotten away from me a bit. I should of planned the day better but it's okay, it will all work out in the end. Hold the phone, I feel sort of lightheaded all of a sudden. Her blood must have been tainted! But how could they possibly know I would go after her of all people. I'm not even allowed to feed on campus. I have to post this now before I physically can't. I have to call Bug before it's too late. I'll let you all know what happens, and if this spell passes and I'm wrong, then I will be right back..",

        "text": " Subjects Journal was found in campsite 221 in \\[REDACTED\\]. A couple days later the subject was found, on the ground.\n\nEntry No. 1 -\n\nMe and my friends decided to travel over summer break to a campsite deep in the adirondacks. But we didn’t know that these things would be waiting for us. Everything had gone pretty smoothly over the past couple of days, the drive was only a short 5 hours, we rotated who was driving every hour. We unpacked and set up hammocks between a couple trees, even going as far as doubling up, hammock over hammock for me and Jimmy. We we’re all stiff from the long ride and the campsite was humid as hell. Combine that with the campsite next to us having crying babies, we decided to swim at a pond that was just a hop skip and a jump away from us. The others were hesitant about it, opting to just walk back and try to pass time another way. Even though they didn’t join me, I decided to jump in. It was grotesquely warm, and as soon as I was in I wanted out.\n\nIt's the middle of the night. Something horrible is here. I heard a distant, unearthly screeching, something that couldn’t belong to god's animals. I originally played it off as a cruel trick of my imagination, or (i don’t know how) the wind. Yet it happened again, this time sounding closer, and filled with more malice. I was in the bottom hammock, with my friend sleeping above me. He usually snores so loudly, yet I heard nothing at all from him. Actually I heard nothing from anybody. The silence was piercing and unearthly, as if I were in a different dimension. I reached for my flashlight that I kept in my bag that hung on the side of my hammock. I clicked it on, to see that every single one of the hammocks was completely empty, the only thing left was the embers of a forgotten campfire. As i landed my foot crushed a small twig, creating a horrifying \\*crack\\* in the deep silence. Ice ran down my spine, as a paralyzing fear shot through me. I waited, too afraid to breathe. I waited for it to find me. The silence was back, no screaming, nothing. Suddenly, it was there. A Huge beast, almost like a minotaur, with eyes that glowed a dim yellow. A lion head, its jaw dropping inhumanely low, its mane was covered in blood. Its body was gray/ pinkish, a back with a hunched over spine, covered in blisters and wounds. Legs that were stumpy and thick. It sniffed the air, tasting with its tongue which had previously hung limply in its mouth. My heart was breathing through my chest, but I dared not breathe. It stepped up to me, I stood still as a statue, for my instincts were screaming at me, that if I even blinked, or twitched, I would be killed immediately. It sniffed me onceover, and then with a gruff snort, began stomping away back into the forest.\n\nI waited 30 minutes, no sign of it, no noises left, and only then did I let myself feel relief. I walked over and sat on a stump. Actually that's where I'm writing this right now, in my camp journal. I need to do something as I doubt i’ll sleep at all tonight\n\nEntry No. 2 -\n\nThe morning was damp, my clothes were uncomfortably moist, and clung to my skin. Last night, after laying in my hammock for a while, my friends had somehow come back, when questioning them about it this morning they just looked confused. I tried to tell the story of what happened to my friend but they all waved it off as my imagination or a fever dream. But I know what I saw. After tiredly changing out of my clothes, I went to grab my toothbrush. While wiggling my hand around in the bag I felt the stiff leather of my journal, and decided to take it out and open it up again to review what I had written the night before. I flipped through the pages looking over my entry. Could I have written this out of delusion? It was then I noticed something, as the light through the trees hit the final page of my entry I saw ink on the other side, I hadn't written anything else, had i? My skin crawled as I looked over the newly found writing. In splotchy big letters it read “DON’T TRUST THEM, THOSE ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS” My heart raced as i thought through what this could possibly mean, was this a prank? No, what I experienced last night was real, and this could explain why all my friends went missing and are acting like nothing happened. I couldn’t let them know about this, I fervently shoved my journal back into my camp bag and noticed them all staring at me. They didn’t quite look human, more like poorly put together parts of a human being. The one representing Jimmy took a step towards me. I started shouting “No, please god no!” As a smile stretched on his face, I stumbled backwards, tripping on a loose root. My head hit the ground with a dull “Thud” and everything went black.\n\nI had a raging headache, the only thing I could see was a bright light. I had woken up on a local hospital bed. I screamed as I saw Jimmy at my bedside, a couple of doctors and nurses came rushing over to hold me down as I tried to run away. “Your injuries!” a doctor shouted. After a couple more seconds of struggling I fell limp, exhausted. It didn’t seem like “Jimmy” was going to be openly violent right now. What did they want with me, what are these things and why did they bring me to the hospital? All I knew was that I couldn't let them know about the message in my journal. The doctor told me I was going to have to stay in this hospital bed for the night, that I had a concussion and had passed out for the past hour or so. Jimmy and my other friends’ had asked me various questions about why I was screaming and fell backwards. I had to play the part of the confused friend who didn’t know what happened in the fear that *they* might figure out that I know and do something to me. They left to go get me food and a drink, and I'm trying to write this entry as fast as I can.\n\nThere’s another one, a note written on the next page after my second entry. This time it was a long list of instructions. Ways to kill these *things.* It described some sort of ritual involving burning and stabbing using a steel weapon of some sort. This is what I needed to do. If I don't kill them, they will kill me, and if you don’t see another log in this journal I am either dead or close to it.\n\nEntry No. 3 - Final entry.\n\nIt's over. Those things have been split open and burnt like a pig on a fire. It’s giving me an almost *gleeful* feeling. I told them I was fine and left the hospital early, so we went back to camp, and had the brilliant idea of telling them to light the fire that I was gonna use to perform the ritual. We were all sitting around it as the sun went down, exchanging stories and cooking s’mores. I told them I had to leave to take a piss, but while their backs were turned, I grabbed a steel tent stake, and stabbed those things that had taken my friends right in the back, their screams were gleefully horrifying. They were too shocked to fight back, I guess those things didn’t know that I knew about them. Each time I stabbed one it filled me with pleasure and satisfaction. When they all stopped moving, I tossed their corpses into the fire. But I've realized that this whole camp is filled with these beasts, they writhed and stomped about. I’m making it my mission after I'm done writing this to exterminate every one, wish me luck!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEND OF JOURNAL\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSubject Steven Hoffer was found dead after killing 27 people. After killing all his friends at their campsite he began going around the camping ground and murdering children, women, and men alike. Eventually, Steven arrived at campsite \\[Redacted\\]. Where Robert \\[Redacted\\] shot him twice with a shotgun. The autopsy showed that he had been infected with some new sort of hallucinogenic parasite that had infected the local pond. The notes that steven had wrote about were identified as stevens own hand writing and are likely due to him being infected by the parasites. We don't know how many others are currently affected and will employ damage control effectively immediately. \n\nSteven's body is being used and tested on to see what conditions the parasites can spread or survive in. 2 criminals have been killed after becoming infected and hostile, saying they were saying \"Horrible Creatures\" when we try to interact with them. A Cure has not yet been found but testing will continue.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zzjok7/the_vulture_house_part_1/)\n\n \n\nI took a shaky step backward, hardly even realizing I was moving. Ollie stood in place, unable to keep his eyes off the severed arm on the ground, dried blood oozing from the cut and pooled around the limb itself. The arm had a chunk bitten out of it, letting parts of the bone poke through. In fact, a good portion of the arm was bone at that point, thanks to the vultures, but I could still see each individual, dirty, greying finger that made it extremely clear as to what I was looking at.\n\n“Ollie, we need to g—”\n\nBefore I was able to continue, a deafening blast came from the lower floor and a spray of wood erupted right in front of us, a fair-sized hole forming in the floor. I screamed and Ollie immediately grabbed onto my arm and pulled me forcefully to the other side of the room, hopping over the hole in the ground.\n\n“You little bastards need to get the fuck out of my house! I’m gonna blow your brains out all over the walls!” A strong, raspy male voice called from downstairs. I was shaking at this point and I wanted to vomit, but I was completely frozen and unable to do anything other than stand huddled up against Ollie behind a pile of crates in the back right corner.\n\nThe smell coming from this area was impossibly strong and I knew it had to be the source of the stench. Ollie held onto my shoulder tightly as he panned his flashlight down to our feet, which is when we noticed we were crouching in what looked like a pool of thick, fleshy blood. I screamed again and leapt forward, crashing into the boxes and sending them flying across the floor. I scratched my elbows pretty badly, and the pain mixed with the panic made me start crying. I sat up and shined my light at Ollie and noticed the top half of a body laying across the floor, the stomach gutted open like a fish, and two bloody stumps where the arms were supposed to be. The head was caved inward, like the person had been bashed in the face with an anvil. Nothing about the body looked human anymore. Ollie covered his mouth with his hand and I watched his chest rise and lower sporadically as he started to hyperventilate, and he stood up in what seemed to be the mauled remains of the corpse’s legs. He stumbled over to me and landed on the ground beside me, staring wide-eyed at something. I flung my head over my shoulder and saw that the crates had broken open when I fell into them, and they were filled with brownish, rotting bones. Hundreds of bones, now scattered across the ground, making up more area on the floor than wood. I let out another wailing cry and hugged Ollie’s arm tightly, thinking that this nightmare couldn’t get any worse than it already was.\n\nThat was when we heard the sound of pounding footsteps making their way up the stairs.\n\n“April, we have to jump out the window,” Ollie said, his voice strained. I could tell he was crying at this point, too. “It’s gonna hurt, but we don’t have any other option. You go first.”\n\n“Ollie—” I started, before I saw the dark figure of a man arrive at the top of the stairs. He was huge, definitely above six feet, and he had a sort of beer gut. His eyes were bugged like a madman, open wider than I thought was humanly possible. He had a scruffy beard that had flakes of grey in it. It was definitely the neighbor, but somehow he looked like a totally different person at this point in time. He smiled when he saw us, his teeth long and yellowed. He aimed the gun at us.\n\n“My vultures are gonna have a *feast* tonight,” he growled.\n\n“Go!” Ollie screamed, pushing me as hard as he could. He ducked down and laid on his stomach as he shoved me, and I landed hard on my already hurt elbows. Another shot rang out, louder this time, and I felt wood splinters rain on my side from the wall to my left as another hole was blown into the house. I picked myself up and, using nothing more than pure adrenaline, hurled myself toward the window. I grabbed the top of it and hopped onto the bottom of the frame before I slipped my arms outside. I looked over my shoulder inside the house one last time and saw Ollie making a mad dash for the window as well, only for his foot to get caught in the hole that was shot in the floor. I was already pulling myself back into the house when the neighbor cocked his shotgun again. Ollie looked up at me desperately. “Please go!” His scream ripped through his throat and planted itself into my brain. I took his words to heart and repositioned myself to where I was before, with my hands against the soft, brittle wood of the outside of the building, looking out into the night on the edge of the window frame. I pressed my hands against the side of the house and pushed off, falling to the ground below me. I landed a few feet away from the crate I used to get into the house, feeling my ankle twist from under me. I cried out in pain, my throat scratching and burning. All I felt was a blinding pain in every part of my body at that point, but I was quickly pulled out of my daze when I heard another gunshot, followed by a blood-curdling, ear-piercing scream come from Ollie.\n\nIt was a sound that was so foreign to me; he had never sounded so terrified, so hopelessly scared and hurt in my entire time of knowing him. There was a lot of loud banging coming from inside, and lots of grunts and struggling. I curled up into the fetal position where I had landed and cried silently to myself, staring with an unblinking gaze at the window I leapt out of. I cried even harder, so hard that no noise came out and my chest spasmed as it forced every last tear out of my body when I heard another gunshot, then a thump, then silence. I squeezed my legs tightly and pushed my eyes into my knees, not being able to process what I had just heard. Drool poured over my lips and my nose was running like crazy, but I didn’t care enough to wipe any of it away. I had given up at that moment, which is why I also didn’t move when I heard footsteps make their way to the window. I sat there and waited for the neighbor to shoot me, for everything to go dark and for my brain to shut off in an instant. At that point, I was ready for anything if it meant not having to go on without my best friend. My brother.\n\n“The hell are you doing? Get back to your house, dipshit!”\n\nMy head bolted up when I heard that and I was met with the sweaty, pale, blood-splattered face of Ollie, leaning weakly against the window frame. He was panting like a dog, but I saw him try to play his lips into some semblance of a smile. I felt like such a crybaby, because I couldn’t stop myself from crying out of relief. I forced myself to stand, almost collapsing from how badly my legs were shaking.\n\n“Are you okay?” I yelled, each word I spoke making me cry harder.\n\n“He shot me. He shot my foot. It hurts. A lot. But I’m gonna be okay, I’ll go down the stairs and bust the front door open. Go inside and call the cops. Get an ambulance too.” He looked down for a moment, presumably inspecting his injured foot. He lowered a little, seeming like his body was about to give out on him. “Fuck, I’m gonna puke.”\n\n“I’ll go get help,” I said, then turned around and sprinted towards my house. My ankle hurt like a bitch, but more adrenaline kicked in as I ran, so I quickly forgot about the pain. I was crying, yet smiling at the same time as I ran. All the terror I had just experienced melted away into incredible comfort knowing that Ollie was okay. He even called me a dipshit, so I knew he was still sort of himself, even if he was badly hurt. I laughed to myself when I thought about that. There was nothing I wanted to do more than hug Ollie; I wanted to sit on the couch and just hold onto him like I was going to lose him. Because I really thought I had lost him. But first I knew that he needed help with something that I couldn’t help with, so I dragged myself out of my mind and focused on reality again.\n\nI burst through the backdoor and was met with my mom putting paper grocery bags on the kitchen island. She looked at me with a slight smile, which quickly faded when she realized the state I was in.\n\n“April? Honey, what’s wrong, what happened?” She asked quickly, releasing the bags and jogging over to me. She held my face with her hands and paled faster than I had ever seen anyone go pale. I was still breathing heavily with tear stains on my face and blood caked on my arms. I would be terrified if I saw my child run through the door looking like that, too. I could hardly bring up the right words to say.\n\n“Police… call the cops… the police… Ollie needs amb- an ambulance.” I stretched my arm out and pointed out the backdoor. “The house. The neighbor, he’s killing people. Us, he almost killed *us*.”\n\n“What’s going on?” My dad said as he came around the corner, lifting his reading glasses onto his head. My mom looked back at him and moved her hands to my shoulders.\n\n“Call 911. Get an ambulance. The neighbor did something.” She spoke matter-of-factly, despite her voice wavering heavily. Not waiting another second to question the situation, my dad nodded and raced over to the landline on the other side of the kitchen. As he talked to the police, my mom held onto me tightly and caressed my head, trying to help me calm down. I was shaking like a leaf, and despite my mom’s calming words and shushing, I just couldn’t sit still. I was like that until the backdoor swung open forcefully and I saw a beat-up, bloody, utterly exhausted Ollie stumble in.\n\n“Ollie!” I said, breaking free from my mom’s hug and running over to him. I hugged him tighter than I had ever hugged him before, letting his curls dance around my fingers and the beads of sweat come off on my hand, the heavy rising and falling of his chest and he panted into my ear. I didn’t care how gross and dirty he must’ve been. I was just happy he was alive.\n\n“April, hi,” he said, his voice hoarse and weak. He returned the hug, thereby letting off most of his weight onto me. “I need to sit down.” I looked down at his foot, remembering what he said, and had to bite my tongue to keep myself from screaming. His foot was nothing more than a bloody stump with the hoodie he previously had around his waist tied as tightly as it could go around it. I nearly let go of him, but gained composure again when I felt him start falling. My mom rushed over and helped me get Ollie to a chair at the kitchen table, and my dad, having been done with the call to the police for a few minutes now, ran off somewhere else in the house. I didn’t know what he was doing until he came back with a box of gauze and a bottle of antiseptic.\n\n“This won’t hold up for long, but it should help, at least until the ambulance gets here. You’ll be alright, son, just hold on for a minute.” He crouched down in front of Ollie and untied his hoodie, grimacing at the sight the piece of clothing was covering.\n\nHis foot was still there, sort of. He had three toes left and a giant chunk of the side of his foot had been taken off, and you could see a bit of bone sticking out, but you could tell it used to be a foot. I had to look away and was only able to offer the comfort of my hand to hold when my dad said “This is gonna hurt, kid,” before pouring the antiseptic onto the wound. My mom rubbed Ollie’s back as he screamed, the sound coming out gritty and rough, as if his voice were already gone completely and he was forcing some foreign exclamation of pain out of his torn-up throat. He squeezed my hand so hard that by the time my dad had put the gauze on, I could see clear fingernail prints in the palm of my hand. It hurt, but I knew I was in nowhere near as much pain as Ollie was. When I looked back at him he was crying, holding his free hand up to his face. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and cried again with him, but I didn’t have any more tears left.\n\nThe cops came pretty quickly, but then again I wasn’t really keeping track of time at that point. They ushered Ollie into the ambulance as soon as they saw the state he was in, and they brought me in there with him as well, letting me sit on the edge of the car with my feet dangling outside the open doors. The paramedics did a quick check-up on me and cleaned up the scratches on my elbows, placing two big bandaids over them. Once they were done, I hopped out of the car and watched as they sped off to the hospital with my best friend, who I thought was bleeding to death at the time. The cops remained and asked me a bunch of questions about what we had been doing and what we saw in the house, and I hold them the whole truth about everything, from the moment we decided to sneak into the house to when I saw Ollie get stuck in the hole in the floor before jumping out the window. Unsurprisingly, the cops immediately left to go investigate the house, and when they came back they reported what they found to us. The neighbor was lying on the ground, his head — or what was left of it — resting on the first step of the stairs. It was clear that his cause of death was being shot by the shotgun at quite a close range.\n\n“Ollie,” I muttered. “Ollie got him.” I looked up at the cops. “But he had to! He was going to die if he didn’t!”\n\n“We know, sweetheart,” one of the cops said. He was tall and had pasty skin with a handlebar mustache, and he looked vaguely preoccupied with the note he was writing. “We aren’t gonna punish him for that. The only thing we care about right now is making sure that foot of his gets patched up.”\n\n“When will I get to see him? When will he come home?” The officer clicked his tongue and shook his head.\n\n“Not sure yet, honey. His foot got pretty messed up, so it’s gonna take awhile to help fix him up.”\n\n“But he’s going to be okay,” a lady officer with light brown skin and dark coily hair pulled up into a bun said, placing her hands on my shoulders gently. “He’ll be back to you in no time. And I’m sure he’d love a visit from you at the hospital.” She smiled at me, and I somehow managed to smile back.\n\nThe investigation concluded not even a week after the initial incident, but I wasn’t allowed to learn anything super in-depth about it, which I thought was sorta bullshit. But essentially, the neighbor had several bodies hidden around his old barn house that he never tore down, and all those crates, including the ones outside and the ones I stood on to get inside the building, were full of the leftover bones from his victims. Everyone involved believes his main motive was simply to feed his “pets” he had gathered, aka the vultures. It’s such a screwed-up situation, and I hate that we couldn’t get any deeper detail about the whole ordeal, but I guess I’m just glad all that shit is over.\n\nOllie stayed in the hospital for eight days before he was released. I visited him every single one of those days. His wound hadn’t gotten infected, which was incredible, considering the cleanliness of the old house. He ended up having to get his foot amputated at the ankle, and he was given a prosthetic one to replace it. Naturally, he wasn’t very happy about it, but I tried my best to cheer him up, saying he’d look like some kind of cool cyborg superhero. That made him smile, and throughout the duration of his stay we made up a story about the boy with a bionic foot who now had incredible kicking strength and beat up a bunch of bad guys. He also told me what went down after I had jumped out the window. Basically, the guy had shot the foot that was stuck in the hole, which sort of helped him out by letting him get the rest of his leg out of the floor. Before the guy could shoot at him again he grabbed the barrel of the gun and pointed it at the ceiling, repeatedly punching the man in the stomach, then in the throat, until he was able to make the neighbor lose his grip on the gun. He fell back to the ground and aimed at his head and shot blindly, killing him instantly. I was so taken aback by the story, and all I could do was tell him how awesome he was over and over again. By the time he was released, he gained a little bit of himself back and started making jokes about his foot, which always cracked me up. He was taking a very positive outlook on it, and I was proud of him for that.\n\nNot everything was peachy again, though. He quit wanting to do taxidermy because it reminded him of the event too much. He also had days where he’d just sit quietly for a few minutes, staring at his artificial foot. He was very open about his feelings with me, however, and would tell me that he just felt off. He felt different and thought he was some type of freak.\n\n“Freak? Ollie, you’re the coolest fucking kid I know,” I told him once, about a week after he was released. He laughed.\n\n“I thought you didn’t like using language like that.”\n\n“I don’t care! I don’t know how else to express just how cool of a person you are. You’re different now, sure, but you’re still *you*. You’re Oliver Hartford, the kid who shot a guy in the face and escaped with a blown-off foot. You’re Ollie, the guy that saved my life, and the guy I’ll never be able to thank enough for still being here with me.” Ollie smiled genuinely for the first time that whole day and looked at me.\n\n“Thanks, April. I’m really glad to be here with you too.”\n\nNow that taxidermy wasn’t his thing anymore (which I ended up quitting, too, though I still occasionally helped my dad with it when he would work on a project), Ollie switched to poetry. I guess those English classes really did rub off on him. He was shy to share his poems at first, but he eventually got to the point where he would be so excited to read them to me that he’d sit me down and make me listen right then and there, no matter what I was doing. And I did listen. I listened to every word he said and appreciated it, not just because he was actually an incredible writer with great description and emotion in his work, but because I just liked hearing his voice. I liked hearing him excited and like himself again. I liked hearing him alive.\n\nHere’s a poem of his that he read to me and gave me a copy of:\n\n*“You are the green in the trees*\n\n*The blue water flooding the pond*\n\n*The yellow beams of sun*\n\n*The one that makes the blood spill worth it*\n\n*And even through the darkest, inkiest nights*\n\n*And the cloudy, sunless days*\n\n*Your caring hands hold me close*\n\n*All of my flesh and all of my metal*\n\n*And it makes all the blood spill worth it”*",

        "text": "Suspects Journal was found in campsite 221 in \\[REDACTED\\]. A couple days later the suspect was found, on the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEntry No. 1 -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my friends decided to travel over summer break to a campsite deep in the adirondacks. But we didn’t know that these things would be waiting for us. Everything had gone pretty smoothly over the past couple of days, the drive was only a short 5 hours, we rotated who was driving every hour. We unpacked and set up hammocks between a couple trees, even going as far as doubling up, hammock over hammock for me and Jimmy. We we’re all stiff from the long ride and the campsite was humid as hell. Combine that with the campsite next to us having crying babies, we decided to swim at a pond that was just a hop skip and a jump away from us. The others were hesitant about it, opting to just walk back and try to pass time another way. Even though they didn’t join me, I decided to jump in. It was grotesquely warm, and as soon as I was in I wanted out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's the middle of the night. Something horrible is here. I heard a distant, unearthly screeching, something that couldn’t belong to god's animals. I originally played it off as a cruel trick of my imagination, or (i don’t know how) the wind. Yet it happened again, this time sounding closer, and filled with more malice. I was in the bottom hammock, with my friend sleeping above me. He usually snores so loudly, yet I heard nothing at all from him. Actually I heard nothing from anybody. The silence was piercing and unearthly, as if I were in a different dimension. I reached for my flashlight that I kept in my bag that hung on the side of my hammock. I clicked it on, to see that every single one of the hammocks was completely empty, the only thing left was the embers of a forgotten campfire. As i landed my foot crushed a small twig, creating a horrifying \\*crack\\* in the deep silence. Ice ran down my spine, as a paralyzing fear shot through me. I waited, too afraid to breathe. I waited for it to find me. The silence was back, no screaming, nothing. Suddenly, it was there. A Huge beast, almost like a minotaur, with eyes that glowed a dim yellow. A lion head, its jaw dropping inhumanely low, its mane was covered in blood. Its body was gray/ pinkish, a back with a hunched over spine, covered in blisters and wounds. Legs that were stumpy and thick. It sniffed the air, tasting with its tongue which had previously hung limply in its mouth. My heart was breathing through my chest, but I dared not breathe. It stepped up to me, I stood still as a statue, for my instincts were screaming at me, that if I even blinked, or twitched, I would be killed immediately. It sniffed me onceover, and then with a gruff snort, began stomping away back into the forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited 30 minutes, no sign of it, no noises left, and only then did I let myself feel relief. I walked over and sat on a stump. Actually that's where I'm writing this right now, in my camp journal. I need to do something as I doubt i’ll sleep at all tonight\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEntry No. 2 -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe morning was damp, my clothes were uncomfortably moist, and clung to my skin. Last night, after laying in my hammock for a while, my friends had somehow come back, when questioning them about it this morning they just looked confused. I tried to tell the story of what happened to my friend but they all waved it off as my imagination or a fever dream. But I know what I saw. After tiredly changing out of my clothes, I went to grab my toothbrush. While wiggling my hand around in the bag I felt the stiff leather of my journal, and decided to take it out and open it up again to review what I had written the night before. I flipped through the pages looking over my entry. Could I have written this out of delusion? It was then I noticed something, as the light through the trees hit the final page of my entry I saw ink on the other side, I hadn't written anything else, had i? My skin crawled as I looked over the newly found writing. In splotchy big letters it read “DON’T TRUST THEM, THOSE ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS” My heart raced as i thought through what this could possibly mean, was this a prank? No, what I experienced last night was real, and this could explain why all my friends went missing and are acting like nothing happened. I couldn’t let them know about this, I fervently shoved my journal back into my camp bag and noticed them all staring at me. They didn’t quite look human, more like poorly put together parts of a human being. The one representing Jimmy took a step towards me. I started shouting “No, please god no!” As a smile stretched on his face, I stumbled backwards, tripping on a loose root. My head hit the ground with a dull “Thud” and everything went black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a raging headache, the only thing I could see was a bright light. I had woken up on a local hospital bed. I screamed as I saw Jimmy at my bedside, a couple of doctors and nurses came rushing over to hold me down as I tried to run away. “Your injuries!” a doctor shouted. After a couple more seconds of struggling I fell limp, exhausted. It didn’t seem like “Jimmy” was going to be openly violent right now. What did they want with me, what are these things and why did they bring me to the hospital? All I knew was that I couldn't let them know about the message in my journal. The doctor told me I was going to have to stay in this hospital bed for the night, that I had a concussion and had passed out for the past hour or so. Jimmy and my other friends’ had asked me various questions about why I was screaming and fell backwards. I had to play the part of the confused friend who didn’t know what happened in the fear that *they* might figure out that I know and do something to me. They left to go get me food and a drink, and I'm trying to write this entry as fast as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere’s another one, a note written on the next page after my second entry. This time it was a long list of instructions. Ways to kill these *things.* It described some sort of ritual involving burning and stabbing using a steel weapon of some sort. This is what I needed to do. If I don't kill them, they will kill me, and if you don’t see another log in this journal I am either dead or close to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEntry No. 3 - Final entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's over. Those things have been split open and burnt like a pig on a fire. It’s giving me an almost *gleeful* feeling. I told them I was fine and left the hospital early, so we went back to camp, and had the brilliant idea of telling them to light the fire that I was gonna use to perform the ritual. We were all sitting around it as the sun went down, exchanging stories and cooking s’mores. I told them I had to leave to take a piss, but while their backs were turned, I grabbed a steel tent stake, and stabbed those things that had taken my friends right in the back, their screams were gleefully horrifying. They were too shocked to fight back, I guess those things didn’t know that I knew about them. Each time I stabbed one it filled me with pleasure and satisfaction. When they all stopped moving, I tossed their corpses into the fire. But I've realized that this whole camp is filled with these beasts, they writhed and stomped about. I’m making it my mission after I'm done writing this to exterminate every one, wish me luck!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEND OF DOCUMENT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuspect Steven Hoffer was found dead after killing 27 people. After killing all his friends at their campsite he began going around the camping ground and murdering children, women, and men alike. Eventually, Steven arrived at campsite \\[Redacted\\]. Where Robert \\[Redacted\\] shot him twice with a shotgun. The autopsy showed that he had been infected with some new sort of hallucinogenic parasite that had infected the local pond. The notes that steven had wrote about were identified as stevens own hand writing and are likely due to him being infected by the parasites. We don't know how many others are currently affected and will employ damage control effectively immediately",

        "text": "Time\n\nThe greatest, yet most terrifying of mysteries that pervade the universe. Man has driven himself, his own flesh and blood, his entire race to the grave, clawing and scratching to escape the crushing force of time’s arrow.\n\nTime, you see, takes everything, everyone, and in the end, darkness is all that’s left.\n\nFor as far back as I can remember, that darkness, the inky eternal void of space, has been my one true passion, a refuge for my overactive imagination and curiosity of the expanse of spacetime we inhabited. The finest wines, intoxicants, women and men alike, nothing could ignite my fever, nor chill my blood quite like the ever expanding void of the cosmos.\n\nMine had been a time of debauchery, indulgence, and excess, though only at the highest levels of society. The politicians, ever so arrogant and unaware of the trouble brewing outside their own doors, had done nothing for centuries, nothing to help our land escape the decay of its indulgence, nor anything to appease the bourgeoisie they had so viciously exploited for far too long. Revolution had been inevitable for many years, so when it came, it came swiftly and brutally.\n\nThe endless war stretched on, and with every fallen soldier sent back home in a hallowed box, my hope and resolve for our world, our kind, our way of life, dwindled away. The neverending hordes of soldiers and fallen comrades, sights so horrible and so full of despair, my heart wept for every drop of blood spilled. After four years of senseless genocide, our power hungry generals, fat with pride, refused to stop the onslaught, even if it meant making every other woman in our country a widow. Day after day I would look young men in the eyes, lie to them and tell them they’d all be going home for the holidays, knowing it would be the last thing they would ever hear.\n\nSleep was a precious luxury only afforded on the rarest of occasions. The screams of my wounded and dying troops, haunting as they were, melted away in the pitch black expanse of the night sky. I yearned for a way out, an escape from this godforsaken rock and a way to explore the cosmos for the rest of my existence.\n\nIf you could sell your soul for whatever you wanted, what would you wish for?\n\nWe’ve probably all either wondered or been asked a variation of this question in our lives. Money, wealth, power, the return of a loved one or the heart of another. Most of us couldn’t even fathom what it would mean to give up your soul, your very essence, for a chance to have your dreams come true. Most wouldn’t know what to do with that newfound power once given it, and most would die unfulfilled and just as dead on the inside, with only eternal damnation to look forward to.\n\nThe funny thing about hell though, is that fire can get awfully tempting then you're stuck on an iceberg.\n\nOne night, one cloudless night.\n\nI remember it well.\n\nIt’s one of the few days that remain as clear to me now as in the moment it had happened. It was night, the sun had long slipped beyond the horizon and was already barreling back towards the other side. I’d found a spot around 30 or so yards away from the main camp, just far enough away to wear the screams of agony were mere whispers. I looked up into the cloudless sky, saw the thousands of glimmering stars, shining from billions of light-years into space, dreaming of the day humanity would finally gain access to the cosmos.\n\nI prayed, for the first time in over a decade, for the chance to make those dreams a reality. I would give everything, live a thousand and one eternities in hell for just a chance at divine ecstasy.\n\n*Please, please god. Just this once.*\n\nIn that same second, a rumbling nearby broke me from my trance. Bombs. Another raid perhaps. I sat upright quickly and looked towards the coming storm. More rumbling. The camp had been alerted and was sounding the alarm. I had to act fast. Desertion had been considered a crime of ultimate cowardice, of betrayal. Only the lowest rat of the foulest sewer would abandon their duty to their country in times of war, especially when we were so close to victory.\n\nOnly I knew that to be a lie. There was no going back from the atrocities our country had committed in the name of honor and power. I wanted nothing more to do with the fat bureaucrats masquerading as leaders, or the country they’d led into ruin. My mind was already made up. I scanned my surroundings, and thankfully, the hill I’d chosen gave me a decent view of the clearing, even in the dark. I looked for anything, any sign of a town or house. There was a smattering of smoke to the west illuminated by flickering lights, an isolated woodland village, or so I hoped. It didn't matter. I’d already committed to my path and began running down the hill towards the lights, away from my life and everything I’d ever known.\n\nNot a moment too soon as it turned out, as a deafening explosion roared behind me just seconds later. The ground shook and threatened to send me on my feet, but my extensive training had largely cured me of my clumsiness, and so I was able to retain my balance as a torrent of scorched earth rained down all around me. The treeline was thankfully just yards away from my original spot, and the undergrowth provided plenty of protection for me to regain my bearings.\n\nJust a dozen or so yards to my left, another explosion sounded off, and the smell of fuel and fire began to fill the air around me. Having only barely caught my breath moments before, I broke out into another full sprint, my padded clothing providing plenty of protection from the thick brush. A hail of gunfire followed another explosion, further to my right, and I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking I’d escaped whomever had given chase.\n\nIt only took five or so minutes to reach the village, which was rather quaint compared to the bustling city I’d come from. The population had largely fled judging from the vacant shops and abandoned vehicles in the streets, which was perfect for me. If I wanted to survive on my own, I was going to need supplies.\n\nI’d never stolen a single item, not even a loaf of bread, in my entire life before the war. I certainly wasn’t proud of it, and harbored tremendous guilt even given the circumstances. I rationalized that I would return to repay the debt once I’d gotten settled, which was a feeble endeavor in it of itself. My conflicted morality aside, I crept through the dark and quiet streets, taking note of the surprisingly lack of destruction despite the raging war only a stone's throw away.\n\nI chose what looked to be an antique shop of some kind, possibly full of valuable treasures I could pawn off for somewhere else. The break-in itself was easy enough, as none of the doors were locked. After checking the back, I decided on the basement cellar, thinking the most valuable items would be stored there. Closing the doors behind me, the previously quiet night was soon full of the sounds of twisted, rusty metal. I held my breath for a moment, sure my cover had already been blown. After about a minute or so, I assumed the coast was clear and proceeded forward.\n\nJust as I had predicted, the cellar was indeed filled to the brim with antiques and oddities, the likes I’d never seen before. There were the usual items, such as ornamental clocks and music boxes, all unfortunately coated in a fine layer of soot and dust. But then there were other items, objects so mysterious and foreign, I couldn’t decipher their origin or purpose. There was this rather plain looking ruby gemstone embedded in an ancient slab of rock, inscribed with an ancient language I had no hope in translating. Thinking it might be worth something, I grabbed it and placed it in my rucksack. There were other stones of varying color and size. As beautiful as they were, most of them wouldn’t fetch me much on their own, and I was going to have limited carrying space as it was. As I turned a corner, I saw there was a section of the cellar that had been sectioned off by several bookcases and a hole-ridden drape. In every store, there’s always a section where you store the “real” goods, treasures too valuable to sit on the floor, and I assumed that this was theirs.\n\nCasting the drapes aside, I was met with a single shelf with only a handful of items that looked quite ordinary at first glance. Another gemstone, this one a deep amber, what looked like a set of daggers wrapped in a leather sheath, and a jar of liquid containing what I assumed to be a human brain. A little off putting for sure, but far from the most gruesome sight I’d ever seen.\n\nYou should see brains when they’re not in a jar.\n\nI’m sure there was a long backstory for why each of these objects had been set aside, but apart from their admittedly intriguing presentation, nothing stood out as being particularly valuable. As I was turning to leave, I caught the glint of something from the bottom shelf, something I’d overlooked. Bending over to get a better look, I reach out to grab the shiny metallic object.\n\nIt was an ornate oil lamp, by far the most intricate and exotic I’d ever seen. The material was of the finest quality, a glossy black metal that was quite heavy for such a small object. There was no wording or description, at least nothing I could make out. Instead, there was only a series of abstract shapes spawning off from the open brim that branched off into a series of strands, encircling the entire lamp. It was indescribably beautiful, yet there was something almost sinister about its iridescent black hue, the way it appeared to absorb light instead of reflecting it.\n\nThis moment, out of the endless more that would come, I remember so vividly; the weight of the lamp in my hand, the musty smell of the cellar, everything is still so clear after all these years.\n\nIf given the chance, would I do anything differently? Would I place the lamp back on the shelf and continue on with my original plan?\n\nCould I?\n\nSurely though, it was surely worth a fortune, all I needed was to find the right vendor. My home country was well known for its black market trading, so provided I found passage back, finding a buyer shouldn’t take too long. I reached to grab it, but no sooner had my fingers touched the surface, a thunderous explosion sent me and the contents of the entire shelf to the floor. I barely registered the sound of gunfire before another loud blast sent a shower of burning wood right on top of me.\n\nStruggling under the intense pain and growing mountain of debris, I struggled in vain to regain my senses. Sound was completely gone and my vision was quickly fading as well. Through the dark, I could briefly make out a hazy orange glow which quickly revealed itself as fire. With great difficulty, I managed to drag myself from under what I later saw to be a large section of the floor above me. The night sky was visible, though barely so under the growing plume of smoke billowing out of the basement. Getting back on my feet, I began to frantically search the cellar for the exit, but to my dismay, the growing inferno had already consumed the wooden staircase leading up to the store front.\n\nPanic began to set in as I tried to double back and search for the way I had originally come in. The suffocatingly thick smoke had already filled the room and my already severely reduced vision became fuzzier with each passing breath. Stumbling to my knees once more, I wheezed as I cried out for someone, anyone to help me. But there was no one, no one to return my cries but a rapid fire of torched bullets. With the last breath I thought I’d take, I collapsed to the floor and looked upwards to the sky. Though the smoke had clouded much of my view, I was still able to make out a handful of glittering stars. I tensed up and closed my eyes, readying myself mentally for a pain beyond comprehension.\n\nThat was when my hands felt the metallic surface of the lamp, still wrapped in my fingers. Somehow it had remained tethered to me despite all the destruction around me. Despite the raging fire around me, the lamp remained cold to the touch, providing some relief from the surging heat. I thought it was funny, how I would die in this basement, burning in agony all because of this lamp. Maybe someone would find my skeleton years later, the lamp still firmly grasped to my hand.\n\nThey’d probably have to break my fingers off in order to get the lamp.\n\nThe thought made me chuckle, and in that moment, I felt an aura of peace I’d never experienced before in my life. I was ready. No, I’d always been ready. The fire I’d always been searching for was now just within reach. I waited, fully at peace with the fate that was about to befall me.\n\nOnly the fire never came.\n\nAnd oh how I wish it had.\n\nInstead, a tugging at my arm was followed by a firm yet gentle pull as my entire body was drug slowly away. I protested at first, not wanting that fleeting glimmer of serenity to fade, but it was too late. The heat from the fire had already washed away as waves of cool air made their way into my weakened lungs. I coughed, wheezed, and stuttered before my eyes finally flickered open. I was outside, the beautiful night sky now fully visible with only hints of smoke to block the view. I’d stopped moving, and with what little strength I had left, propped myself up to get a look at my rescuer.\n\nAt first I thought my eyes had deceived me, that the smoke inhalation and adrenaline were affecting my cognitive abilities. Though I was certainly far from the largest of my troops, I still had put on a hefty amount of weight and muscle, and therefore it would have taken a great deal of effort to lift me from a burning cellar.\n\nYet as I continued to blink and rub my eyes, the tiny form of an old beggar woman only became more and more apparent. I was stunned of course, yet no less grateful. I smiled and sprung to my feet, intending to thank her eternally for saving my life, but was sent back down to the ground by a growing intense pain spreading from my lower leg, the one that’d been almost crushed in the basement. The woman helped me to stand, retorting quickly under breath, so quietly I almost didn’t catch her.\n\n“It’s not safe here. Follow me”\n\nHer words had a cool, clipped inflection that flowed wonderfully with her accent. I nodded my head and followed her, limping along as we slowly made our way back into the woods and away from the burning village. For such an old woman, I had trouble keeping pace with her, and several times I lost sight of her ghostly white hair in the brush, only for her to somehow end up behind me, always with a smile.\n\nBefore too long, we arrived at a tiny cottage, probably a mile or so away from the village. The smell of burning wood and gunpowder was still thick in the air, but the muffled explosions told us we were a good enough distance away to relax for the time being. Inside the cabin, which was surprisingly warm and maintained for such an isolated spot, the elderly woman set about taking care of my injuries. With the adrenaline wearing off, surges of pain were beginning to spread from just about every part of my body.\n\nMy groan and cries did little to desaude my caretaker from doing her job. In fact, with each little grunt or cry of anguish, she would gaze deeply into my eyes with the gentlest look in hers, and any pain I had felt would vanish. She had a healing power to her, that much was obvious. Perhaps she had been a doctor’s assistant or surgeon, for she moved with great precision and speed.\n\nMy leg had suffered a minor fracture that would heal in a month's time, she promised, and my lungs and eyes needed to rest after so much exposure to toxic fumes. With a gin and tonic, along with some beautiful pink capsule she’d provided, I was out within seconds. A dreamless sleep was exactly what I needed, and the next morning I arose just minutes after the break of dawn. The old woman was already awake, preparing quite the selection of food fit for an entire army.\n\nAs we ate, she asked me about my post, my life before the war. I answered each question without any in return, my only desire at that moment was satisfying the hunger that had gone unsatiated for many years. So famished was I, I didn’t quite register her next question which I almost answered on impulse.\n\n“So you have abandoned your post then?”\n\nI stopped, only allowing myself to swallow the last gulp of food before looking down in shame. Of course, she would have to ask that. A myriad of possible answers came to mind, but none of them sufficed. Besides, what good would it be to lie to this stranger, this old woman who’d rescued me from a burning building. But just as I was about to answer, suddenly I had a question of my own. One I’d been dwelling over ever since my rescue.\n\n“How’d you rescue me from that fire?” I asked blankly, staring deep into her amber eyes. The layers of wrinkles and swirls of gray hair disguised a former beauty and deep intellect, someone who at one point, or perhaps still was, a person of significance and grace. A woman that was not to be trifled with. She only smiled, pausing for a second before answering.\n\n“I saw you come into the shop.” Though her outwardly shell had seen better days, her voice was strong, echoing loudly over top of my own. I continued to study her, my years of training now analyzing her every move, our surroundings, anything that would clue me in on who this mysterious woman was. Still, my thoughts flashed back to my intrusion into the shop, and my attempted theft. The lamp, which was now safely resting in my side pocket, suddenly felt ten tons heavier.\n\n“It was your shop then?” I replied back, the guilt and shame growing by the second.\n\n“It’d been my home for many years, yes. Don’t worry yourself though, I’m happy to be free of it.” the woman said with a smile, and as I looked closer, I noticed something unsettling that I had not dawned on me yet.\n\nHer voice. It had been raspy and soft in the forest, but inside the cabin it had grown sharp and stronger. But that wasn't the only thing.\n\nHer skin.\n\nUnder the dim moonlight, it had appeared worn and wrinkled, but under the glow of the warm fire it was smoother, more defined. The long eroded beauty that time had taken away seemed to thrive in the little wooded oasis. She didn’t appear to notice my studious gaze, as she was seemingly locked into one of her own. Our eyes finally met after a few moments, and the instant they did, I could have sworn she looked even younger. A good decade seemed to have been wiped from the woman's face seemingly overnight.\n\nFinally, she spoke up once more.\n\n“You never answered my question young man. Have you abandoned your post as lieutenant?”\n\nI was immediately caught off guard once again as an icy chill coursed it way throughout my body, filling every vein with a chilly sting and raising every hair on my body. I hadn’t told her my rank, only that I’d been serving in the armed forces and had fled in the middle of the night. Nervously, I decided to play her game, see what else she knew.\n\n“Well, not just my post. My life, such as it is.” I was honest and to the point, no need for lies here. Besides, I had a feeling she would detect them the minute they left my lips.\n\nShe smiled and nodded, as if expecting the answer. She closed her eyes for a moment and whispered something to herself so softly I had no hope in hearing what it was. She then looked back at me with the most intense, longing expression, like she was seeing right into my very soul.\n\n“You harbor a tremendous pain inside you my dear, you’ve carried it with you for as long as you could walk. An aching, to see sights not of this world, to leave your wretched society of excess and hypocrisy behind. I’ve seen your pain reflected in the faces of monarchs, swindlers, and tradesmen from every corner of the globe. It’s an insidious pain that grows patiently, slowly decaying the body and soul from the inside. It becomes a cancer, feeding on misery, propelling us further into the void.”\n\nIt was astounding, listening to her as she spoke. Thoughts and desires, never utter aloud to another soul, now coming straight from these strangers lips as if she were peering straight into the very recesses of my mind. I couldn't help but feel somewhat…violated, now that my deepest kept secrets were out in the open. There was nowhere to run from them in this place.\n\n“How did you know-” I was about to say before she cut me off, anticipating this question for some time no doubt.\n\n“I know a great many things, young man. My time here in this world has been long and filled to the brim with heartache and suffering. I'm well acquainted with the same pain you’ve tried in vain to run away from your entire life. You crave an escape, a chance to quench your thirst for adventure. I can feel the fires of passion burning bright, yearning to be set free. Would you like me to help you, to set the fire free?”\n\nShe spoke with such reverence, such conviction, as if she were giving a sermon and I was her only congregation. I was confused, unsure of how to proceed forward. Her youthful emergence and strange yet prophetic ramblings belied her true intentions. She was guiding me towards some already predetermined destination, and I was powerless to resist. Curiosity had always been the thorn in my side, constantly getting me into all manner of trouble. Eager to know what she had to offer me, a runaway ex-soldier chasing the stars, I asked the question, that fatal question that would decide my fate forever.\n\n“How? How could you possibly help me?”\n\nShe looked back into my eyes with that same soul piercing gaze she’d had before. The wrinkles that had been so thoroughly ingrained into her skin minutes ago had all but vanished, leaving only a few scattered ridges behind. Her radiant beauty now shined brighter than the evening star, with little resemblance to the beggar woman who’d rescued me.\n\nWhat was this trickery? A slight of hand perhaps? There’d been old wise tales from my childhood about witches and dark magic that dwelled in the nether regions, places too far and too cold for mortal man to trespass. I’d never been one for superstition before. But fear has a funny way of making you a believer.\n\n“What if I told you I could give you what you desire? A chance to make all your wildest dreams come true. The adventure you desperately seek is out there, I promise you, it exists. A place halfway between reality and fantasy, between the real and the unreal; it’s just beyond that blue veil my child. I’ve seen it, and many other places. Worlds just like this one, some stranger and alien beyond comprehension. Endless universes, full of every possibility and more, awaits you! You’ve never been so close!”\n\nHer passion was infectious, so much so that I almost believed her.\n\nAlmost.\n\nI’d been the victim of fraud before, and she wouldn’t be the last trickster to try and swindle me as far as I was concerned. Perhaps she meant well, maybe even believed her own delusions of grandeur. Perhaps I was suffering from a psychotic break, which would certainly explain the woman’s ever changing appearance. I’m not sure why I continued to play along with her charade when all I wanted was to leave and forget I’d ever encountered this strange person, my blood oath to her be damned.\n\nBut how does that phrase go again, about curiosity and the cat?\n\n“So what? You grant me my deepest desires, and I give you what in return? My undying gratitude? My life, my soul? I’ve read this story before, and it never ends well for the main character.” I laughed under my breath as I spoke. I had fancied myself quite the clever lad, always playing chess when everyone else was playing checkers.\n\nBut oh how I’d underestimated my opponent. With her word and every passing second, her spell over me grew stronger and stronger, and little did I know she was about to play her final hand.\n\n“No, of course not my child. Though your suspicion is not unwarranted. I require nothing from you, for you have already given me everything I could ever ask for. I only seek to liberate you from the internal hell you’ve been trapped in all your life, to give you the adventure you’ve craved from the moment you first saw that glimmer in the sky, knowing there was an entire universe out there, just waiting for the taking. You can have it, child. Everything and beyond. All you have to do is tell me what it is that you desire.”\n\nThe glint in her eye as she finished has been burned into my brain, though all the lost years and eons. There were so many signs, so many chances to turn away, to return to my tortured life. The air itself seemed to be chilled by her words, and her clipped and seductive accent only furthered the aura of mystery that clung to her.\n\nI studied my rescuer one last time. Any traces of the elderly beggar woman had been all but erased, replaced by an exotic and indescribable beauty. The pale wrinkled skin was now a smooth, shiny, and a perplexing shade of brown that I’d never seen before. Her hair, formerly a ghostly gray, was now a salt and peppered mixture of ginger and blonde that swirled around in an intricate braid. Her amber eyes were wide and practically lifted straight from the center of the earth. Everything about her invited you in, propelled you to know more.\n\nOf course, that had always been the plan, had it not?\n\nStill, the smallest piece of hope the war and my life hadn’t completely stomped out, yearned for the life she had spoken of. Yet it would be that same hope that would doom me to an eternity in the void.\n\n“Fine, you want to know what I really desire?” I spoke with a sincerity and confidence I’d not felt in many moons, not since the early days of the war. Her gaze was now firmly locked onto mine once more, and the sense of mental invasion crept over me yet again.\n\nShe had me, hook line and sinker.\n\n“I want to see everything. Every star, every planet, every moon, every galaxy. I want to travel to the furthest reaches of creation, see every sight there is to see. I want to know the answers to every question ever asked by mankind, to travel at speeds he has only ever dreamed of. But most of all, I want to live long enough to see it all. To see the future, to marvel in the glory of what mankind will become. I want to be… eternal.”\n\nMy famous last words.\n\nI’d all but forgotten the woman and our woodland surroundings as I spoke. My thoughts were already far behind the veil, beyond the stars and flying through the black void. My childlike imagination had been my only refuge, my oasis in the black desert. I looked over to the woman, who’s smiling expression was now deeply unnerving. Her toothy grin had spread from ear to ear, and her eyes were closed so tightly it looked as if they were about to roll back into her head. As soon as they opened once more, her eyes gleamed with such ferocious intensity they threatened to jump clean from her face. Her lips motioned as if she were about to speak, but the words that came out were almost inaudible and so my ears strained to pick them up.\n\n“Siempre Vive…”\n\nWe sat there, each locked in a deep gaze with the other. My shallow, labored breathing alongside her barely audible whispers were the only detectable sounds, the deafening sharp silence only intensifying as our standoff came to its sudden and anticlimactic end. She only spoke once more, with her final words all but seared into my memory.\n\n“I knew you were going to be special. Every man unlucky enough to walk the earth has craved the adventure you seek. But at long last, your search is over. So you desire, my child, so it shall be.”\n\nIn the same moment that she finished, a loud and bellowing yell echoed from somewhere in the cabin. It took several seconds to realize that the screaming was coming from me. All at once, an intense burning pain began spreading from my lower body. It was hot, hotter than any conflagration I’d ever witnessed, burning brighter than a thousand white hot suns. I screamed louder and louder, praying to a nonexistent god for the first time in over a decade. The woman didn’t move to help me as she’d done before. She only sat opposite me, with that crooked smile now deeply ingrained into her skin, her formerly amber eyes now pitch black. I could do nothing as tendrils of fog began to wrap their fingers around my subconscious, plummeting me backwards into the void.",

        "text": "Time\n\nThe greatest, yet most terrifying of mysteries that pervade the universe. Man has driven himself, his own flesh and blood, his entire race to the grave, clawing and scratching to escape the crushing force of time’s arrow. \n\nTime, you see, takes everything, everyone, and in the end, darkness is all that’s left.\n\nFor as far back as I can remember, that darkness, the inky eternal void of space, has been my one true passion, a refuge for my overactive imagination and curiosity of the expanse of spacetime we inhabited. The finest wines, intoxicants, women and men alike, nothing could ignite my fever, nor chill my blood quite like the ever expanding void of the cosmos.\n\nMine had been a time of debauchery, indulgence, and excess, though only at the highest levels of society. The politicians, ever so arrogant and unaware of the trouble brewing outside their own doors, had done nothing for centuries, nothing to help our land escape the decay of its indulgence, nor anything to appease the bourgeoisie they had so viciously exploited for far too long. Revolution had been inevitable for many years, so when it came, it came swiftly and brutally. \n\nThe endless war stretched on, and with every fallen soldier sent back home in a hallowed box, my hope and resolve for our world, our kind, our way of life, dwindled away. The neverending hordes of soldiers and fallen comrades, sights so horrible and so full of despair, my heart wept for every drop of blood spilled. After four years of senseless genocide, our power hungry generals, fat with pride, refused to stop the onslaught, even if it meant making every other woman in our country a widow. Day after day I would look young men in the eyes, lie to them and tell them they’d all be going home for the holidays, knowing it would be the last thing they would ever hear. \n\nSleep was a precious luxury only afforded on the rarest of occasions. The screams of my wounded and dying troops, haunting as they were, melted away in the pitch black expanse of the night sky. I yearned for a way out, an escape from this godforsaken rock and a way to explore the cosmos for the rest of my existence.\n\nIf you could sell your soul for whatever you wanted, what would you wish for?\n\nWe’ve probably all either wondered or been asked a variation of this question in our lives. Money, wealth, power, the return of a loved one or the heart of another. Most of us couldn’t even fathom what it would mean to give up your soul, your very essence, for a chance to have your dreams come true. Most wouldn’t know what to do with that newfound power once given it, and most would die unfulfilled and just as dead on the inside, with only eternal damnation to look forward to.\n\nThe funny thing about hell though, is that fire can get awfully tempting then you're stuck on an iceberg. \n\nOne night, one cloudless night. \n\nI remember it well. \n\nIt’s one of the few days that remain as clear to me now as in the moment it had happened. It was night, the sun had long slipped beyond the horizon and was already barreling back towards the other side. I’d found a spot around 30 or so yards away from the main camp, just far enough away to wear the screams of agony were mere whispers. I looked up into the cloudless sky, saw the thousands of glimmering stars, shining from billions of light-years into space, dreaming of the day humanity would finally gain access to the cosmos.\n\nI prayed, for the first time in over a decade, for the chance to make those dreams a reality. I would give everything, live a thousand and one eternities in hell for just a chance at divine ecstasy. \n\n*Please, please god. Just this once.*\n\nIn that same second, a rumbling nearby broke me from my trance. Bombs. Another raid perhaps. I sat upright quickly and looked towards the coming storm. More rumbling. The camp had been alerted and was sounding the alarm. I had to act fast. Desertion had been considered a crime of ultimate cowardice, of betrayal. Only the lowest rat of the foulest sewer would abandon their duty to their country in times of war, especially when we were so close to victory. \n\nOnly I knew that to be a lie. There was no going back from the atrocities our country had committed in the name of honor and power. I wanted nothing more to do with the fat bureaucrats masquerading as leaders, or the country they’d led into ruin. My mind was already made up. I scanned my surroundings, and thankfully, the hill I’d chosen gave me a decent view of the clearing, even in the dark. I looked for anything, any sign of a town or house. There was a smattering of smoke to the west illuminated by flickering lights, an isolated woodland village, or so I hoped. It didn't matter. I’d already committed to my path and began running down the hill towards the lights, away from my life and everything I’d ever known. \n\nNot a moment too soon as it turned out, as a deafening explosion roared behind me just seconds later. The ground shook and threatened to send me on my feet, but my extensive training had largely cured me of my clumsiness, and so I was able to retain my balance as a torrent of scorched earth rained down all around me. The treeline was thankfully just yards away from my original spot, and the undergrowth provided plenty of protection for me to regain my bearings. \n\nJust a dozen or so yards to my left, another explosion sounded off, and the smell of fuel and fire began to fill the air around me. Having only barely caught my breath moments before, I broke out into another full sprint, my padded clothing providing plenty of protection from the thick brush. A hail of gunfire followed another explosion, further to my right, and I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking I’d escaped whomever had given chase. \n\nIt only took five or so minutes to reach the village, which was rather quaint compared to the bustling city I’d come from. The population had largely fled judging from the vacant shops and abandoned vehicles in the streets, which was perfect for me. If I wanted to survive on my own, I was going to need supplies. \n\nI’d never stolen a single item, not even a loaf of bread, in my entire life before the war. I certainly wasn’t proud of it, and harbored tremendous guilt even given the circumstances. I rationalized that I would return to repay the debt once I’d gotten settled, which was a feeble endeavor in it of itself. My conflicted morality aside, I crept through the dark and quiet streets, taking note of the surprisingly lack of destruction despite the raging war only a stone's throw away. \n\nI chose what looked to be an antique shop of some kind, possibly full of valuable treasures I could pawn off for somewhere else. The break-in itself was easy enough, as none of the doors were locked. After checking the back, I decided on the basement cellar, thinking the most valuable items would be stored there. Closing the doors behind me, the previously quiet night was soon full of the sounds of twisted, rusty metal. I held my breath for a moment, sure my cover had already been blown. After about a minute or so, I assumed the coast was clear and proceeded forward.\n\nJust as I had predicted, the cellar was indeed filled to the brim with antiques and oddities, the likes I’d never seen before. There were the usual items, such as ornamental clocks and music boxes, all unfortunately coated in a fine layer of soot and dust. But then there were other items, objects so mysterious and foreign, I couldn’t decipher their origin or purpose. There was this rather plain looking ruby gemstone embedded in an ancient slab of rock, inscribed with an ancient language I had no hope in translating. Thinking it might be worth something, I grabbed it and placed it in my rucksack. There were other stones of varying color and size. As beautiful as they were, most of them wouldn’t fetch me much on their own, and I was going to have limited carrying space as it was. As I turned a corner, I saw there was a section of the cellar that had been sectioned off by several bookcases and a hole-ridden drape. In every store, there’s always a section where you store the “real” goods, treasures too valuable to sit on the floor, and I assumed that this was theirs. \n\nCasting the drapes aside, I was met with a single shelf with only a handful of items that looked quite ordinary at first glance. Another gemstone, this one a deep amber, what looked like a set of daggers wrapped in a leather sheath, and a jar of liquid containing what I assumed to be a human brain. A little off putting for sure, but far from the most gruesome sight I’d ever seen. \n\nYou should see brains when they’re not in a jar. \n\nI’m sure there was a long backstory for why each of these objects had been set aside, but apart from their admittedly intriguing presentation, nothing stood out as being particularly valuable. As I was turning to leave, I caught the glint of something from the bottom shelf, something I’d overlooked. Bending over to get a better look, I reach out to grab the shiny metallic object. \n\nIt was an ornate oil lamp, by far the most intricate and exotic I’d ever seen. The material was of the finest quality, a glossy black metal that was quite heavy for such a small object. There was no wording or description, at least nothing I could make out. Instead, there was only a series of abstract shapes spawning off from the open brim that branched off into a series of strands, encircling the entire lamp. It was indescribably beautiful, yet there was something almost sinister about its iridescent black hue, the way it appeared to absorb light instead of reflecting it. \n\nThis moment, out of the endless more that would come, I remember so vividly; the weight of the lamp in my hand, the musty smell of the cellar, everything is still so clear after all these years. \n\nIf given the chance, would I do anything differently? Would I place the lamp back on the shelf and continue on with my original plan? \n\nCould I?\n\nSurely though, it was surely worth a fortune, all I needed was to find the right vendor. My home country was well known for its black market trading, so provided I found passage back, finding a buyer shouldn’t take too long. I reached to grab it, but no sooner had my fingers touched the surface, a thunderous explosion sent me and the contents of the entire shelf to the floor. I barely registered the sound of gunfire before another loud blast sent a shower of burning wood right on top of me. \n\nStruggling under the intense pain and growing mountain of debris, I struggled in vain to regain my senses. Sound was completely gone and my vision was quickly fading as well. Through the dark, I could briefly make out a hazy orange glow which quickly revealed itself as fire.  With great difficulty, I managed to drag myself from under what I later saw to be a large section of the floor above me. The night sky was visible, though barely so under the growing plume of smoke billowing out of the basement. Getting back on my feet, I began to frantically search the cellar for the exit, but to my dismay, the growing inferno had already consumed the wooden staircase leading up to the store front. \n\nPanic began to set in as I tried to double back and search for the way I had originally come in. The suffocatingly thick smoke had already filled the room and my already severely reduced vision became fuzzier with each passing breath. Stumbling to my knees once more, I wheezed as I cried out for someone, anyone to help me. But there was no one, no one to return my cries but a rapid fire of torched bullets. With the last breath I thought I’d take, I collapsed to the floor and looked upwards to the sky. Though the smoke had clouded much of my view, I was still able to make out a handful of glittering stars. I tensed up and closed my eyes, readying myself mentally for a pain beyond comprehension.\n\nThat was when my hands felt the metallic surface of the lamp, still wrapped in my fingers. Somehow it had remained tethered to me despite all the destruction around me. Despite the raging fire around me, the lamp remained cold to the touch, providing some relief from the surging heat. I thought it was funny, how I would die in this basement, burning in agony all because of this lamp. Maybe someone would find my skeleton years later, the lamp still firmly grasped to my hand.\n\nThey’d probably have to break my fingers off in order to get the lamp.\n\nThe thought made me chuckle, and in that moment, I felt an aura of peace I’d never experienced before in my life. I was ready. No, I’d always been ready. The fire I’d always been searching for was now just within reach. I waited, fully at peace with the fate that was about to befall me.\n\nOnly the fire never came. \n\nAnd oh how I wish it had.\n\nInstead, a tugging at my arm was followed by a firm yet gentle pull as my entire body was drug slowly away. I protested at first, not wanting that fleeting glimmer of serenity to fade, but it was too late. The heat from the fire had already washed away as waves of cool air made their way into my weakened lungs. I coughed, wheezed, and stuttered before my eyes finally flickered open. I was outside, the beautiful night sky now fully visible with only hints of smoke to block the view. I’d stopped moving, and with what little strength I had left, propped myself up to get a look at my rescuer. \n\nAt first I thought my eyes had deceived me, that the smoke inhalation and adrenaline were affecting my cognitive abilities. Though I was certainly far from the largest of my troops, I still had put on a hefty amount of weight and muscle, and therefore it would have taken a great deal of effort to lift me from a burning cellar.\n\nYet as I continued to blink and rub my eyes, the tiny form of an old beggar woman only became more and more apparent. I was stunned of course, yet no less grateful. I smiled and sprung to my feet, intending to thank her eternally for saving my life, but was sent back down to the ground by a growing intense pain spreading from my lower leg, the one that’d been almost crushed in the basement. The woman helped me to stand, retorting quickly under breath, so quietly I almost didn’t catch her.\n\n“It’s not safe here. Follow me”\n\nHer words had a cool, clipped inflection that flowed wonderfully with her accent. I nodded my head and followed her, limping along as we slowly made our way back into the woods and away from the burning village. For such an old woman, I had trouble keeping pace with her, and several times I lost sight of her ghostly white hair in the brush, only for her to somehow end up behind me, always with a smile. \n\nBefore too long, we arrived at a tiny cottage, probably a mile or so away from the village. The smell of burning wood and gunpowder was still thick in the air, but the muffled explosions told us we were a good enough distance away to relax for the time being. Inside the cabin, which was surprisingly warm and maintained for such an isolated spot, the elderly woman set about taking care of my injuries. With the adrenaline wearing off, surges of pain were beginning to spread from just about every part of my body. \n\nMy groan and cries did little to desaude my caretaker from doing her job. In fact, with each little grunt or cry of anguish, she would gaze deeply into my eyes with the gentlest look in hers, and any pain I had felt would vanish. She had a healing power to her, that much was obvious. Perhaps she had been a doctor’s assistant or surgeon, for she moved with great precision and speed. \n\nMy leg had suffered a minor fracture that would heal in a month's time, she promised, and my lungs and eyes needed to rest after so much exposure to toxic fumes. With a gin and tonic, along with some beautiful pink capsule she’d provided, I was out within seconds. A dreamless sleep was exactly what I needed, and the next morning I arose just minutes after the break of dawn. The old woman was already awake, preparing quite the selection of food fit for an entire army. \n\nAs we ate, she asked me about my post, my life before the war. I answered each question without any in return, my only desire at that moment was satisfying the hunger that had gone unsatiated for many years. So famished was I, I didn’t quite register her next question which I almost answered on impulse.\n\n“So you have abandoned your post then?”\n\nI stopped, only allowing myself to swallow the last gulp of food before looking down in shame. Of course, she would have to ask that. A myriad of possible answers came to mind, but none of them sufficed. Besides, what good would it be to lie to this stranger, this old woman who’d rescued me from a burning building. But just as I was about to answer, suddenly I had a question of my own. One I’d been dwelling over ever since my rescue.\n\n“How’d you rescue me from that fire?” I asked blankly, staring deep into her amber eyes. The layers of wrinkles and swirls of gray hair disguised a former beauty and deep intellect, someone who at one point, or perhaps still was, a person of significance and grace. A woman that was not to be trifled with. She only smiled, pausing for a second before answering.\n\n“I saw you come into the shop.” Though her outwardly shell had seen better days, her voice was strong, echoing loudly over top of my own. I continued to study her, my years of training now analyzing her every move, our surroundings, anything that would clue me in on who this mysterious woman was. Still, my thoughts flashed back to my intrusion into the shop, and my attempted theft. The lamp, which was now safely resting in my side pocket, suddenly felt ten tons heavier. \n\n“It was your shop then?” I replied back, the guilt and shame growing by the second. \n\n“It’d been my home for many years, yes. Don’t worry yourself though, I’m happy to be free of it.” the woman said with a smile, and as I looked closer, I noticed something unsettling that I had not dawned on me yet.\n\nHer voice. It had been raspy and soft in the forest, but inside the cabin it had grown sharp and stronger. But that wasn't the only thing.\n\nHer skin. \n\nUnder the dim moonlight, it had appeared worn and wrinkled, but under the glow of the warm fire it was smoother, more defined. The long eroded beauty that time had taken away seemed to thrive in the little wooded oasis. She didn’t appear to notice my studious gaze, as she was seemingly locked into one of her own. Our eyes finally met after a few moments, and the instant they did, I could have sworn she looked even younger. A good decade seemed to have been wiped from the woman's face seemingly overnight. \n\nFinally, she spoke up once more. \n\n“You never answered my question young man. Have you abandoned your post as lieutenant?” \n\nI was immediately caught off guard once again as an icy chill coursed it way throughout my body, filling every vein with a chilly sting and raising every hair on my body. I hadn’t told her my rank, only that I’d been serving in the armed forces and had fled in the middle of the night. Nervously, I decided to play her game, see what else she knew.  \n\n“Well, not just my post. My life, such as it is.” I was honest and to the point, no need for lies here. Besides, I had a feeling she would detect them the minute they left my lips. \n\nShe smiled and nodded, as if expecting the answer. She closed her eyes for a moment and whispered something to herself so softly I had no hope in hearing what it was. She then looked back at me with the most intense, longing expression, like she was seeing right into my very soul. \n\n“You harbor a tremendous pain inside you my dear, you’ve carried it with you for as long as you could walk. An aching, to see sights not of this world, to leave your wretched society of excess and hypocrisy behind. I’ve seen your pain reflected in the faces of monarchs, swindlers, and tradesmen from every corner of the globe. It’s an insidious pain that grows patiently, slowly decaying the body and soul from the inside. It becomes a cancer, feeding on misery, propelling us further into the void.”\n\nIt was astounding, listening to her as she spoke. Thoughts and desires, never utter aloud to another soul, now coming straight from these strangers lips as if she were peering straight into the very recesses of my mind. I couldn't help but feel somewhat…violated, now that my deepest kept secrets were out in the open. There was nowhere to run from them in this place. \n\n“How did you know-” I was about to say before she cut me off, anticipating this question for some time no doubt. \n\n“I know a great many things, young man. My time here in this world has been long and filled to the brim with heartache and suffering. I'm well acquainted with the same pain you’ve tried in vain to run away from your entire life. You crave an escape, a chance to quench your thirst for adventure. I can feel the fires of passion burning bright, yearning to be set free. Would you like me to help you, to set the fire free?” \n\nShe spoke with such reverence, such conviction, as if she were giving a sermon and I was her only congregation. I was confused, unsure of how to proceed forward. Her youthful emergence and strange yet prophetic ramblings belied her true intentions. She was guiding me towards some already predetermined destination, and I was powerless to resist. Curiosity had always been the thorn in my side, constantly getting me into all manner of trouble. Eager to know what she had to offer me, a runaway ex-soldier chasing the stars, I asked the question, that fatal question that would decide my fate forever.\n\n“How? How could you possibly help me?”\n\nShe looked back into my eyes with that same soul piercing gaze she’d had before. The wrinkles that had been so thoroughly ingrained into her skin minutes ago had all but vanished, leaving only a few scattered ridges behind. Her radiant beauty now shined brighter than the evening star, with little resemblance to the beggar woman who’d rescued me. \n\nWhat was this trickery? A slight of hand perhaps? There’d been old wise tales from my childhood about witches and dark magic that dwelled in the nether regions, places too far and too cold for mortal man to trespass. I’d never been one for superstition before. But fear has a funny way of making you a believer. \n\n“What if I told you I could give you what you desire? A chance to make all your wildest dreams come true. The adventure you desperately seek is out there, I promise you, it exists. A place halfway between reality and fantasy, between the real and the unreal; it’s just beyond that blue veil my child. I’ve seen it, and many other places. Worlds just like this one, some stranger and alien beyond comprehension. Endless universes, full of every possibility and more, awaits you! You’ve never been so close!”\n\nHer passion was infectious, so much so that I almost believed her. \n\nAlmost. \n\nI’d been the victim of fraud before, and she wouldn’t be the last trickster to try and swindle me as far as I was concerned. Perhaps she meant well, maybe even believed her own delusions of grandeur. Perhaps I was suffering from a psychotic break, which would certainly explain the woman’s ever changing appearance. I’m not sure why I continued to play along with her charade when all I wanted was to leave and forget I’d ever encountered this strange person, my blood oath to her be damned. \n\nBut how does that phrase go again, about curiosity and the cat?\n\n“So what? You grant me my deepest desires, and I give you what in return? My undying gratitude? My life, my soul? I’ve read this story before, and it never ends well for the main character.” I laughed under my breath as I spoke. I had fancied myself quite the clever lad, always playing chess when everyone else was playing checkers.\n\nBut oh how I’d underestimated my opponent. With her word and every passing second, her spell over me grew stronger and stronger, and little did I know she was about to play her final hand. \n\n“No, of course not my child. Though your suspicion is not unwarranted. I require nothing from you, for you have already given me everything I could ever ask for. I only seek to liberate you from the internal hell you’ve been trapped in all your life, to give you the adventure you’ve craved from the moment you first saw that glimmer in the sky, knowing there was an entire universe out there, just waiting for the taking. You can have it, child. Everything and beyond. All you have to do is tell me what it is that you desire.”\n\nThe glint in her eye as she finished has been burned into my brain, though all the lost years and eons. There were so many signs, so many chances to turn away, to return to my tortured life. The air itself seemed to be chilled by her words, and her clipped and seductive accent only furthered the aura of mystery that clung to her. \n\nI studied my rescuer one last time. Any traces of the elderly beggar woman had been all but erased, replaced by an exotic and indescribable beauty. The pale wrinkled skin was now a smooth, shiny, and a perplexing shade of brown that I’d never seen before. Her hair, formerly a ghostly gray, was now a salt and peppered mixture of ginger and blonde that swirled around in an intricate braid. Her amber eyes were wide and practically lifted straight from the center of the earth. Everything about her invited you in, propelled you to know more.\n\nOf course, that had always been the plan, had it not?\n\nStill, the smallest piece of hope the war and my life hadn’t completely stomped out, yearned for the life she had spoken of. Yet it would be that same hope that would doom me to an eternity in the void. \n\n“Fine, you want to know what I really desire?” I spoke with a sincerity and confidence I’d not felt in many moons, not since the early days of the war. Her gaze was now firmly locked onto mine once more, and the sense of mental invasion crept over me yet again. \n\nShe had me, hook line and sinker. \n\n“I want to see everything. Every star, every planet, every moon, every galaxy. I want to travel to the furthest reaches of creation, see every sight there is to see. I want to know the answers to every question ever asked by mankind, to travel at speeds he has only ever dreamed of. But most of all, I want to live long enough to see it all. To see the future, to marvel in the glory of what mankind will become. I want to be… eternal.” \n\nMy famous last words.\n\nI’d all but forgotten the woman and our woodland surroundings as I spoke. My thoughts were already far behind the veil, beyond the stars and flying through the black void. My childlike imagination had been my only refuge, my oasis in the black desert. I looked over to the woman, who’s smiling expression was now deeply unnerving. Her toothy grin had spread from ear to ear, and her eyes were closed so tightly it looked as if they were about to roll back into her head. As soon as they opened once more, her eyes gleamed with such ferocious intensity they threatened to jump clean from her face. Her lips motioned as if she were about to speak, but the words that came out were almost inaudible and so my ears strained to pick them up.\n\n“Siempre Vive…”\n\nWe sat there, each locked in a deep gaze with the other. My shallow, labored breathing alongside her barely audible whispers were the only detectable sounds, the deafening sharp silence only intensifying as our standoff came to its sudden and anticlimactic end. She only spoke once more, with her final words all but seared into my memory.\n\n“I knew you were going to be special. Every man unlucky enough to walk the earth has craved the adventure you seek. But at long last, your search is over. So you desire, my child, so it shall be.”\n\nIn the same moment that she finished, a loud and bellowing yell echoed from somewhere in the cabin. It took several seconds to realize that the screaming was coming from me. All at once, an intense burning pain began spreading from my lower body. It was hot, hotter than any conflagration I’d ever witnessed, burning brighter than a thousand white hot suns. I screamed louder and louder, praying to a nonexistent god for the first time in over a decade. The woman didn’t move to help me as she’d done before. She only sat opposite me, with that crooked smile now deeply ingrained into her skin, her formerly amber eyes now pitch black. I could do nothing as tendrils of fog began to wrap their fingers around my subconscious, plummeting me backwards into the void. \n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nPart 2",

        "text": "Pain.\n\nThe most extreme of the physical sensations. Used by the darkest, most corrupted souls to instill fear and panic since the dawn of time. Its many variations and unexpected arrivals have made even the most iron willed of men bend to their knees.\n\nThe agony was suffocating. Sensory output was gone entirely, in its place there was nothing but infernal torment. The pain was raw, uncompromising, and unrelenting. I would’ve begged for death, had I any vocal chords to scream with, though death was certainly a possibility. Was this my purgatory? My punishment for betraying my country, my people, by running away in the night like a filthy sewer rat? \n\nNo, I was alive, that much I knew. Just barely, the tiniest of threads, tethering me to the mortal coil. There was nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothing to taste. Nothing but the pain.\n\nBut I was still alive.\n\nThe first sensation I regained was the feeling of my heavy labored breathing. It was guttural and sent waves of pain charging through my tarred and blackened lungs. That was it though. Just the movement of my charred body and the steady, fluid rhythm of pain.\n\nI remained in that state for some time, slowly regaining my senses one at a time. Hearing was the next to return. It started off as an impossibly distant hum, growing in intensity ever so slightly. I began picking up brief snippets of sounds; a voice here, the clanging of metal there. I still couldn't move, couldn’t speak, couldn’t see. \n\nBut I was breathing, and I could hear again. That meant I was healing. The pain was still as present as ever, but as my senses returned, I could feel the raw and exposed flesh beginning to heal as well. The pain dulled day by day, mercifully receding back into the void. Though not so much as to keep me from screaming uncontrollably once my vocal chords had healed enough to allow them to vibrate.\n\nImmediately a flurry of activity started up all at once. I could sense and hear several others rush to my side, poking and prodding just about every orifice of my body before injecting me with something that immediately took all the pain away. It was a welcomed and merciful reprieve from the relentless torture. It had been an experience beyond comprehension, beyond description. I’d never felt more disconnected and depersonalized, feeling as if entered into another plane of existence. I wanted nothing more than to escape, to be able to see and feel the world around me again. \n\nIt would be some time before I would regain my sight or any motor functions. Thus far I’d been an invalid, dead to the rest of the world for all intents and purposes. There had been no hope for me, the nurses and staff would later say. I’d been found amongst the rubble of the antique store, assumed to be a local that’d stayed behind. Luckily for me, depending on how you look at it, the fire had burned away any trace of my former identity, and thus I’d escaped punishment for my desertion.\n\nAt least for the moment.\n\nThey almost buried me, they said. I had been torched beyond recognition, deep penetrating burns covering 99% of my body. Only my tortured wheezing had alerted them that I was somehow still alive. The healing process had started almost immediately apparently, as they had to cut several sheets and bandages from my skin after fresh new skin had grown over top. The doctors had never seen anything like it. Given the accelerated rate of growth, I was expected to make a full recovery within as little as two months. \n\nThe return of my sight came rather abruptly. One day, everything was a murky fog with little to distinguish shapes, colors, anything. But the next day, light and color were much sharper and I was able to make out the general shapes of my caregivers as well as the stark, sterile hospital interior. Once my wheezing had become decipherable and my vision clear, I asked for a mirror, wanting to see for myself what I'd become. They cautioned against it, though I didn't care, and insisted they bring a mirror at once. \n\nAnother grave miscalculation on my part. \n\nThe nurses had assured me that with the rapid rate of growth, my skin should be in much better shape in a matter of weeks. There would likely be minimal scarring, my doctors boldly claimed, and judging by the prickly sensation coming from my head, hair was already starting to come back in. But nothing could convince me that my then monstrous visage was anything less than permanent. My face was a grotesque patchwork of raw, exposed flesh, partially healed baby pink skin that was folding with every motion like tissue paper, and maybe a spot or two around my mouth that’d somehow escaped the inferno. I threw the mirror back in revulsion, shattering it into pieces on the floor. My fractured reflection glared back up at me once more before another dose of sleeping medication hit my veins faster than I could react. \n\nAs I slipped into uneasiness one more time, my gaze fell to my right hand. The shape was unmistakable. The engraving had been deep. White lines of fresh scar tissue that traced perfect lines that wrapped in ornate intricate shapes. My hair would eventually grow back to the dark brown it had always been, my skin would indeed heal with no trace of scarring on my face, torso, legs, and left arm. But my right arm would always bare the only evidence of my encounter with the beggar woman. \n\nEven after all these eons, the oval shape of the oil lamp has never faded.\n\nMy convalescence lasted only a few more weeks, just enough time for a majority of my burns to recede, before my doctor announced I had a visitor. The somber tone in his voice signaled nothing my visitor had to say was good. An assumption that proved to be quite correct. Before they would even set foot in the room, every doctor, ever patient, every nurse had to be removed from the area. With the shutters drawn and the lights dimmed low, my mysterious visitor finally made his grand appearance. He was a general of some sort, and a highly ranked one at that, given his many decorations and stripes that adorned his professionally tailored coat. The colors of our country had long since faded with age and wash, and his haggard worn expression told me everything I needed to know he ever said a word. The war was not going in our favor, nor had it been for sometime. His first words were quick and to the point.\n\n“I hear you’ve become quite the miracle around these parts, lieutenant.”\n\nIt was the moment I’d been dreading for weeks. Nobody had known, at least no one had told me or gave any indication that they had any knowledge of my true identity. I hadn’t been forthcoming with many personal details, passing off my vagueness as amnesia. Nobody had questioned me, distracted by my unprecedented rehabilitation and took every opportunity to poke and prod my body. I supposed they were searching in vain for the secret to my recovery, and it amused me to no end knowing the evidence they sought was right in front of them.  The general, however, had taken one look at me and had immediately drawn the correct conclusions. He took my stunned silence as an opportunity to explain himself. \n\nAs I had thought, the war effort had sent our once proud country into a deep depression, with our former allies now either turning their backs or submitting to defeat. Our arrogant leader, still somehow in power despite our nation’s dwindling odds of victory, refused to submit to defeat and seemed willing to take the entire country down with him. There’d been talks of a coup, though several assassination attempts had already been thwarted and now security around our top officials made any further attempts futile. No one could get close enough.\n\nThat’s where I came in, he said. If my miracle abilities were all they were cracked up to be, then I could be the key to ending the war and giving our nation the only chance it stood at regaining its former glory. The other nations of the world were preparing to join the war effort against us, and our greatly diminished troops could only hold out for so much longer. He was, in essence, asking me to become a literal human shield and assassinate the leader of the country I had once pledged my unwavering loyalty too. \n\nIt was incredible, truly. My deepest, wildest desires had seemingly been granted, nothing had been taken from me besides a few months of my time and a lifetime’s worth of pain and anguish. The price paid, though, paled in comparison to the long future it promised. But now, after having gone through a literal hell of fire and brimstone to crawl away from the life I’d always hated, I was being asked to crawl back through that same fire to end a war I’d never wanted any part of in the first place. \n\n“No” I flatly rejected, and it’s one of the few rash decisions I’ve that I would not end up regretting, despite everything that came my way as a result. It gave me the utmost satisfaction to watch his expression sour quickly, angry his thinly veiled threats had not had their intended effect. The formalities were dropped and his temper flared up as he explained the war effort would not last much longer and that until we surrendered, we were at the complete mercy of the entire world. \n\nI didn’t care, and I told him as such. I was already dreaming of the life I would live once I was free of this place, of the sights I would see now that the shackles of time and age had been unbound. His hostility peaked just momentarily, enough for him to lose his cool and make a motion towards me, like a predator ready to strike. As he composed himself, a crooked, deceptive smile stretched tightly across his face.\n\n“Well, I guess I’ll be leaving then. But make no mistake, I will get what I want, lieutenant. You’ll find I can be quite a persuasive, persistent, and patient man”, and with that, he was gone. Nothing else, not even a moment's pause. He simply turned on his heel and left the room as quickly as he’d come. That was the last time I would ever see him. Not one to get his own hands dirty, it would seem. I won’t lie, those famous last words would haunt me for months to come. I sat back in my bed, shivering to the point of hyperventilation, but no blanket or pillow could keep me warm from the fire I would soon face again.\n\nThey came in the middle of the night, while I was asleep. I became aware of several voices and sensed I was in motion, but the second my eyes opened, someone pierced my arm with a hot needle and I was asleep once more. \n\nWhen I awoke, I was tied to a chair in a dark room, devoid of any light besides a tiny band that stretched across the floor in front of me, signifying the one and only exit. \n\nIt was in this room that I would experience an entirely different level of pain, indescribable from anything I’d experienced yet. I learned what it meant to endure, to experience nothing but the most extreme sensations a person can feel. The burning basement that had almost been my tomb was but a splash in a pond compared to the waters of misery that soon followed, only now there was no way for me to drown. I was left there for several weeks before anyone came in, a test no doubt to see if I would starve to death. Time would prove no amount of malnourishment or dehydration would break my body completely, so the first phase of their sick “experiment” ended and so began the next. \n\nEach “phase”, as it were, would only get worse than the one before. Dismemberment became a usual part of daily routine, and with each passing hour another slice of my skin or piece of flesh would be violently ripped away.I lost every limb, every finger, every toe, every external appendage that could be cut off with ease, which included my eyes, lips, ears, nose, even that which many consider most precious and vulnerable; my heart. Yes, they literally cut my chest open and removed my still beating heart like a demented treasure hunt. But even then, with nothing to pump blood to the rest of my mangled body, no way to keep my brain in operation, no air in my lungs left to breathe…\n\nI was still alive.\n\nEvery cycle, little by little, the extremes my captors were willing to go to for their own sick pleasure shattered what little faith I had in my own people.  This went far beyond “experimentation”, beyond punishment, beyond even the atrocities I’d seen on the battlefield. This was government sponsored torture, a bit of “divine retribution”, as some of the guards called it, for my desertion and refusal to become a weapon of the state. I had the last laugh, or scream so to speak, as ultimately every broken bone would reset, every severed arm and organ would eventually grow back, and in time, every drop of spilled blood would replenish. The futility the torture though never dawned on my captors, who would only ramp up the violence with each failed attempt. Mercifully, my tolerance for the pain would eventually numb me to even their most diabolical “experiments''. \n\nThough I will admit it may have stung after being…”degloved” as they called it. \n\nThe ways in which my body was able to recover by itself astounded everyone, least of all myself. How tiny bones would already be growing where my left arm had been minutes after it was torn from my shoulder. How my throat bled for three days from being continually cut open, but the wells of blood never ran dry. Perhaps most shocking of all was that my healing abilities appeared to be accelerating. Every bone broken mended faster than the one before, each torn appendage reappeared quicker than the last. \n\nOne of their last ditch efforts involved cutting me into pieces and then attempting to roast me in an oven. The heat was intense and the pain, although familiar at this point, still roared loud and strong. They had left the oven burning for almost a week, sure that it would do the trick. Though the second I was pulled out, fresh skin had already begun growing all over my charred torso and little stubs had grown from every severed leg and arm. \n\nIt became a simple game of endurance. All I had to do was outlast them, outlast this ungodly prison sentence, and then I would have my freedom. Their own cowardice and sadism would end up being their downfall, as the war they’d run from for so long finally caught up to them. It began with a rumble here, a small quake there. \n\nThey didn’t hold out long. The alarms had been raised and their best defenses mounted, but it all came crashing down just as quickly as it came. I had hoped that maybe in the panic to escape, I would go overlooked and be allowed to escape unnoticed. These hopes were dashed when a guard appeared to announce that I had been sentenced to life imprisonment, however long that may be, as my final punishment for desertion and high treason against the state. They gave me no opportunity to plead or beg, as the door slammed shut once more, leaving me stranded in complete darkness yet again.\n\nI was never too proud to beg, and even though I knew it was hopeless, that didn’t stop me from pleading and begging until my throat was raw and my voice reduced to a mere whimper. I tried bashing my body against the door, feeling around the room for any drains or means of escape, but to no avail. The facility, whatever it was, had been constructed near some body of water, a river or lake perhaps, and eventually began to flood due to the war raging on overhead.\n\nIt would all eventually come to a swift and sudden end. The bombs stopped dropping and the waters stopped rising. Nobody ever came back to inspect, to make sure I was dead. The location must have been top secret, which made sense given the despicable crimes that occurred there. I hadn’t been the only victim they’d left behind, as evident by the countless, distant screams discernible in-between my own. One by one, they succumbed to the elements and I soon found myself alone, soaking wet, and trapped in the dark with no possible means of escape.\n\nAnd that’s how I spent my first century as an immortal. \n\nIt wasn’t such a horrible existence, not compared to what had come before and what was to come much later. There was thankfully no pain, physically speaking that is. There was nothing for my eyes to adjust to; no shapes, no band of light, nothing but the void. I quickly found out sleep was no longer required, now entirely optional. My dreams were as vivid as they’d ever been, and so I would spend what I assumed to be weeks on end practically comatose, lost in whatever imagined world I’d invented. Though I was sure my mind would eventually succumb to madness, driven to the limits by the titanic darkness that spread in every direction. \n\nAlas, it was not to be, though I would have welcomed a bit of madness to punctuate the mind-numbing darkness. Regrettably, my psyche would hold strong through even the most hopeless moments, when I would try in vain to drown myself in the brackish shallow waters. More out of sheer boredom than any desire to die. The icy cold water was at least something, some experience, something to remind me of the world beyond this one. \n\nMy overactive imagination would thankfully begin to work its magic, and over time the cavernous darkness began to shift, even when I was not asleep. The velvety blackness became the endless expanse of the night sky that I longed for with every fiber of my being. My brain filled in the empty space with planets, stars, asteroids and every manner of astronomical body. It became my own cosmic playground, the very fabric of space and time bending to my will. It allowed me to pass the time exponentially, with nothing but the promise of starlight to keep my hope alive. \n\nThe elements did what they always do, taking back the cold, sterile facility piece by piece. Time takes all things, even nature itself. If left to rot, cities crumble, forests reclaim the land, oceans take back their shorelines, and ecosystems ravaged by man flourish with ease. But even then, time’s arrow only moves so fast, and so I resigned myself to spending a millennia in this prison. Broken and with no hope for escape, I firmly believed that I would go the rest of my life without seeing another member of my own race again. \n\nIt was amusing to imagine the various ways in which I would eventually acquire my freedom, each scenario more fantastical than the next. Perhaps my kind’s future descendants or some alien race from another planet would stumble upon the ruins of the facility, marveling at the last survivor of a ruined world. What would my life be like after that? No doubt I’d be tested, dissected, pulled apart and put back together again many times over. If I was lucky, I’d be put on display in some alien zoo, destined to live out my days as another prisoner until that species was gone too.\n\nMaybe I’d be stuck here for far longer, perhaps for billions of years. Until the star that had given life and warmth to the oasis we’d called home for thousands of years, expanded and consumed our planet whole, leaving no trace behind to hint we’d ever been there. Would the ravenous fires of the sun be enough to scorch my body into oblivion? \n\nAs I said before, my prison sentence would only last about 100 years, give or take. It’s hard to keep track of time when you become unchained from its icy grip. The first sign was the unmistakable splashing of water, just off in the distance. It was so faint had one not been paying attention it may have gone completely unnoticed. But when you're trapped underground in the dark for a hundred years, every drip becomes a waterfall, every creak becomes a crash.\n\nThe splashing intensified, echoing loudly off the rusted walls as it drew closer. It was a large group of individuals, judging from the collection of individual voices. My nerves quickly got the better of me and I froze, unsure of how to proceed. My discovery would cause a great deal of panic no doubt. I couldn’t allow myself to be taken prisoner yet again. Thinking quickly, I slid underneath the surface of the water, expelling every bit of air from my lungs as I sunk to the floor. I had to act with the utmost care if I wanted to get away unscathed, even the slightest miscalculation could be fatal. But the grim prospect of being a prisoner yet again convinced me to keep pushing forward.\n\nOpening my eyes, I lay motionless and waited for the inevitable. Once the group had reached the door, a series of loud bangs and scratches quickly filled the air above. With great effort, the door caved inward, falling down in pieces and sending ripples over the water. Several streams of light poured into the room almost immediately, illuminating my field of view, however murky it was, for the first time in decades. The individual strands of particles, almost too faint to differentiate, cast the slightest of glimmers in the moving waters. The cavernous black was now punctuated with shades of bronze and gray, with the muffled voices clearer and sharper than before. This was my moment, my time to sink or swim, so to speak. With the most careful of hands, I began the laborious task of wading through the water on my back with my hands at my sides. Inch by inch, my fingers pushed me ever so closer to freedom. Had anyone caught a glimpse, I might have resembled some reptilian beast that crawled from the abyss.\n\nBased on my distorted observations, my liberators appeared to be members of my own race, and were speaking a language I vaguely recognized as my own. Their words were peppered with a dialect well beyond the age I’d come from, but regardless, it was joyous to hear familiar voices again. Temptation had always been my Achilles heel, and I resisted a powerful urge to peak my head above water to steal a peak. \n\nWithout warning, the lights from overhead vanished, plunging the room back into eternal night. I momentarily feared the worst, that my liberators would shut the door behind them as they left, unsatisfied in their discovery of an empty room. I listened carefully as the voices quickly receded back into the dark, only rising my head above water once they’d faded into mere whispers. The tiniest rays of light filtered from the now open doorway, signifying my exit. It was the first time I’d even seen the outside of that room in all the time I’d been there. Mounted on the walls and placed several yards apart were a series of lights, placed there by the ones who’d unknowingly rescued me. I almost gasped aloud at the device as I crept by, marveling at its sophistication. It was a technology far more advanced than anything I’d seen before, simple as it was. I was able to remove and replace it back on the wall with ease, and when I pressed down further, the light would become progressively brighter before turning off and restarting the cycle all over again.\n\nAs I would come to find out later, this floor was at the bottom of an enormous complex that seemed to defy the laws of physics. Every intersecting hallway would only lead off into another section of this seemingly endless maze, each darkened hallway stretching infinitely onward into the impenetrable blackness. It appeared the group that had freed me had traversed the facility previously, judging by the placement of lights. The dimmer lit hallways led to dead-ends that were still being discovered, while the brighter lit hallways appeared to have already been thoroughly searched. More than once, I was forced to resubmerge into the water in order to avoid being spotted by the group, of which there appeared to be several. At times my heart was beating so hard I was sure that they’d feel the vibrations through the water. My military training thankfully held strong, and allowed me to escape almost completely unnoticed. \n\nAlmost.\n\nWith great difficulty, I managed to find a staircase after hours of searching. The journey upwards took far longer than I thought, with nothing but endless stairs and doors to greet me on each flight. I kept climbing, pushing back every curious urge to stop and explore. As I turned to climb what would end up being the last set of stairs, it happened.\n\nI never got a chance to look in a mirror after I escaped, so I’ll never be sure just how shocking of a sight I must have been to that poor guard. It was surely a sight beyond any horror story he’d ever heard in his life, as an unmistakable expression of pure revulsion flashed over his face the second our eyes had locked. We both stood there, time seemingly suspended in place. I wanted to say something, anything to assure him I meant no harm. Would it make a difference, would he even understand me? I made a motion forward, a mistake on my part, as it no doubt gave him reason for alarm. He screamed louder than any man would ever dare to admit, spilling over backwards in his chair as he did. I cried back, begging for him to wait, but within seconds he’d already disappeared behind the open door and into the stygian gulf of the unknown. \n\nThough deeply afraid of the storm I’d just unleashed, I had no time to dwell on my colossal mistake. With a singular focus I’d been lacking up till that point, I charged onward and searched for a way out of the ruined facility. My encounter with the guard had caused quite the scare, given the commotion audible off in the distance. Their panicked cries sent waves of nausea through my stomach, which only pushed me forward faster. I’d never ran with such ferocity before, not even on the battlefield. Fortunately, it seemed my muscles had not succumbed to entropy, despite decades of inactivity. On the contrary, I’d never felt more alive, more spirited. I could feel my heart surge as blood rushed through long dormant veins, fueling my resolve and hope for escape. \n\nThe exit had been left unguarded. This was perhaps my greatest bit of luck. Hardly the skirmish I’d anticipated, I proudly and triumphantly walked through the front doors and into the shining sun, feeling the warm radiant heat of the sun as if it were the first time all over again. I wanted this moment to last forever, to bask in the glow of our star’s enrapture, as if the fingers of God himself had wrapped around me. All at once, the weight of my situation came crashing down, as if I were reliving every single year spent trapped underground simultaneously. I’d outlived every man that walked the earth before me, spending a majority of that time trapped in eternal darkness thinking I’d never see the light of day again. \n\nSensing I was enjoying myself, clouds moved in quickly to block my view of the sun, pulling me back into the moment. Scanning my head in all directions, I took stock of my surroundings for the first time. The facility appeared to be a series of interconnected smaller buildings sitting on top of a much larger structure, which was located in the middle of a vast swath of mountainous countryside. The facility was perched on top of a relatively large cliff jutting out into the side of the tallest mountain in the valley. The view of the wooded valley was absolutely spectacular, lifting straight out of the finest fantasy novel ever written. \n\nMy nation of origin had been well regarded across the globe for its scenic beauty and majestic natural features, so my exact location could have been any number of places. There were no signs of any cities or villages as far my eyes could see, so it would be a gamble no matter which direction I choose. A strange noise off to my right caught my attention. It was a sort of whirling chopping sound, as if someone were attempting to slice the air itself. Whatever it was, it was still quite a distance away, though it appeared to be closing that gap quickly. Another flurry of commotion sounded off behind me, telling me my time was nearly up. I quickly ran to the edge of the cliff, taking one last glimpse at the picturesque sunset that cast the most beautiful shade of violet over the valley. \n\nI took one last deep breath, closed my eyes, then took the plunge.\n\nGiven my advanced healing abilities and lack of the need for sustenance, I had expected the fall to be relatively quick and painless, an assumption I had gravely miscalculated. The sickening crunch of breaking bones was unmistakable, as was the shredding of muscle and tissue. The first impact hit the hardest, but was far from the most painful. Smashing my back squarely on top of a massive boulder, I could feel every bone in my spine shatter into pieces. Any and all motor functions ceased immediately, my body becoming a living ragdoll for all intents and purposes. There was nothing but trees and rocks to break my fall as I tumbled all the way down the mountainside and into the valley below. The final impact was the most brutal, as I somehow managed to land almost completely on my head, splintering what remaining vertebrae I had left. I lay crumpled there, my head bent at an impossible angle to where I could clearly see the sky above even though I was laying on my stomach. A gentle breeze alongside that mysterious chopping noise from before drafted in and out of the trees, though they did little to calm my shattered nervous system.\n\nThe pain was beyond horrific, only made worse by my healing abilities immediate activation. I could feel the bones beginning to mend despite not having been set properly yet. They poked and prodded at my torn flesh at unnatural angles, cutting through the skin at the slightest movement. Walking out of this valley would be impossible, not unless every bone was properly reset to the correction position. With great difficulty, I dragged my maimed and broken body along the jagged valley floor and just beyond the treeline of the vast forest that blanketed the region, leaving a messy trail of bone fragments and human tissue behind. As I settled into a position I could loosely define as “comfortable”, I heard a wet, sloshing sound coming from the back of my head. Afraid of what I was going to find, I managed to bring my mangled hand to the back of my skull, or at least where the back of my skull should have been. There was nothing but empty space to greet me, so I pressed in deeper and accidentally pushed my fingers into what was left of my brain. I immediately dry heaved, expelling what little bile had remained in my stomach. I  could feel the jagged edges of my skull already beginning to fill in with new bone, sickening me to the core. \n\nFor the first time, I was repulsed by what I’d become. It was a violation of every natural law, to be able to poke my whole finger into my own brain and yet still somehow cling to life. Every part of me was a direct contradiction to the cycle of life. It had been no dream, my encounter in the shop with the beggar woman, with the black oil lamp. A deal had been forged in fire, and now I had truly become immortal. It was perhaps then that I truly felt the full weight of those words. What would it take to truly destroy me? Would it even be possible? Was I actually going to live forever?\n\nThere was no further time for these questions, as just getting through that first night would prove to be a vicious fight for survival. The mysterious chopping noise from before drifted in between the trees periodically, and though the sun had already set by then, there had been enough lingering light left in the sky for me to catch a glimpse of its source. It was an aircraft of some kind, highly advanced and technologically superior to anything from my time. I would later come to find these vehicles were fittingly named “choppers”. The spotlight mounted to the front told me this “chopper” was looking for me specifically, occasionally casting shadows through the underbrush. I remained undetected throughout the night, though I knew it was only a matter of time before a search party was deployed. My shattered bones would have to be reset by dawn if I wanted to avoid recapture, and so I began the Herculean task of rebreaking almost every bone in my body for the second time that night.\n\nMy neck proved to be quite easy, taking just a single violent jerk to break and re-correct, allowing me to finally see my chest again. I would find that once my bones had been set to the correct position, they’d more or less heal themselves with no need for further breakage. The most painful reset was without a doubt the ribs that had bent inwards, which required me to dig a hole in my lower abdomen and push each broken rib back outwards. It took every fiber of my being to resist the urge to cry out in anguish, though more than a few muffled whimpers managed to slip through. My concealed location though was my only asset, and I had to protect it at all cost. \n\nDespite my best efforts, the night owls that dwelled within the forest took notice of my presence and made themselves known periodically throughout the night. I knew the region to be inhabited by many large and feral beasts, each more ravenous than the next. The largest of which, the mountain bear, circled my bloody stump of a corpse in wide strides, no doubt waiting for the moment I would finally perish so it could claim its evening meal without struggle. It kept a safe distance, coming in for a closer look only once before retreating back to its safe orbit just beyond the treeline. It would eventually leave, bitterly disappointed and hungry, leaving my immortal shell to mend its wounds.\n\nAfter I’d reset enough bones to lay back straight, I collapsed backwards and stared upwards into the night sky for the first time in over one hundred years. The moon had already slipped from view, but everything else was as I remembered and the familiar constellations easily came into view through the underbrush. Though the pain throbbing from my body was almost impossible to ignore, I nonetheless remained fixated at the endless expanse of space as tears of joy welled up inside. Involuntarily, that night at the woodland cabin all those years ago began replaying over and over in my head. The moment had been seared into my memory ever since I’d woken up in the hospital. It was sharp and clear, as if it had only happened moments ago; the smell of the burning stove, the beggar woman’s mysterious and shifting appearance, the black oil lamp. Everything.\n\nThis hadn't been what I’d wished for, not completely. I still remained gravitational bound to this godforsaken rock and had no hope of ever escaping. I was sure that if my body had thus far withstood the seemingly never ending onslaught of abuse, then the cold vacuum of space would provide the ultimate test for my apparent immortality. I swore to myself at that moment that I would dedicate every fiber of my being to making that dream come true, no matter how long or how hard it became. I had only one purpose, one singular goal that would define me going forward. A mystery many before me had attempted to unravel but had succumbed to the natural cycle of life and death before they could even breach the surface. A cruel irony that would no longer hinder my efforts to claim what had always been rightfully mine.\n\nThe universe.\n\nIt wasn’t going to be easy, that much I knew. Space flight and travel had been the stuff of science fiction and fantasy, an unobtainable prospect with the technology available. But given the impressive “chopper” that had been searching for me all night, there were certain to be even more surprises waiting for me. The prospect of rejoining society a century into the future was daunting, and it gave me the slightest of pauses in jumping in too quickly. But it only took one gaze up into the night sky for my priorities to realign, and I knew that no matter the struggles that would come ahead, there was no longer any force on this planet that could stop me from achieving my goals. \n\nThe universe was mine, it belonged to me and me alone.\n\nIt was just before the break of dawn when I heard the ground team beginning to search the area. It caught me off guard, as I had expected them to wait until at least daybreak. Forced back onto my wobbly and heavily bruised legs, which could barely hold the weight of my broken body for more than a few seconds, I made a mad dash into the woods. I developed a cycle of collapsing onto the ground, regaining enough energy to throw myself another few feet before collapsing again only to repeat the cycle again and again. Regrettably, I miscalculated a jump and landed head first into a ravine that resulted in even more fractures and bruises, though it did throw the search team off my scent and gave me enough distance to regain my strength. \n\nThrough the first rays of morning light, I was able to chart a path through the thick undergrowth and tumultuous terrain while avoiding the ever present gaze of the wildlife. Though I had expected to see more woodland creatures, especially given the small trail of blood I had left behind. As I got further from the facility and closer to what I thought to be civilization, the animal population dropped off wildly. Foxes, wolves, and the like had always been common sights in these parts, but their numbers appeared to have drastically declined in the century since.\n\nThere was a steady hum of noise off in the distance that grew louder the longer I kept walking. I was excited to see what had become of the cities and villages I’d left behind, wondering what technological marvels they'd turned into since. Still, nothing would ever come close to the natural perfection of mother nature herself. Her earthly perfume of pine and dirt was as intoxicating as ever, made even more feverish by the harsh orange glow from the morning sun that filtered down through the trees in perfect golden streaks. \n\nAs the woods thinned out, the methodical hum broadened in scope and I began to pick up individual sounds: the loud motor of moving vehicles, more “choppers”, and just the usual hustle and bustle of city life. The clearing gradually opened up to yet another cliffside, this one perched on top a series of interconnected hills that formed a valley of sorts around the central hub of a massive metropolis, the likes of which I’d only ever heard of in books, in wild fantasies of a future full of technological wonder and innovation. It was a conglomeration of steel and concrete, spiraling upwards in a series of skyscrapers that seemed to touch the heavens themselves. The urban sprawl stretched onwards for as far as my eyes could see, stopping only at the very foot of the valley wall opposite of me. The tiny motion of moving vehicles, people, and the ever present “choppers”, everything moved in perfect synchronicity as if the city itself were a biomechanical entity.\n\nIt should have been the utopia of my dreams, my golden ticket to reinvent myself into whomever I choose. But my gaze couldn't be further away from this picturesque monument to human indulgence. My future lay far beyond the limits of this metropolis. With a smile that stretched from ear to ear and a kick in my step I hadn’t had since I was a child, I made my way slowly down the cliffside and towards my temporary home. No matter how long it would take, it would be but a flash in the pan compared to the eons ahead of me.\n\nMy story is just beginning...\n\nPart 1",

        "text": "When i was in my 20s, my goal in life was to be a coroner. It was a job i found so intriguing, in some weird morbid way. I had always wanted to work in the medical field, and due to shows like CSI or law and order, the prospect of figuring out how someone passed in was very fascinating to me. It was a job i knew most people wouldn’t understand, most would be freaked out being surrounded by dead people all day. It wasn’t something that really bothered me though. I didn’t fear death, at least not until i found out the truth. \n\n\nI was in college working on my degree in forensic science. In order to get a job as a coroner one day, i needed to take up an apprenticeship with an active coroner. That’s when i met Dr. Gerber. He was a spry old man, About 65 years old. He was a relatively short fellow, with pale skin and a bald head downed with liver spots. He wore thick glasses with thin frames and often had a headlamp on while working. He certainly was eccentric and seemed to speak in riddles and strange idioms that i could sometimes understand, but other times he left me wondering if he was starting to lose it. \n\n “The names doctor Gerber, sport? What’s yours” he asked with an outstretched hand the first time i met him. “It’s Eric, Eric Pazzuti. Nice to meet you sir.” I replied with enormous respect in my voice. Dr. Gerber was technically a medical examiner, which is different from a coroner, but he had far more education than id be getting so i figured he’d make an excellent mentor. “Eric. That name is just fine. The name of Vikings. Your name is the first thing you ever get to wear, so its important to have a good one!.” He said with a smile that accentuated all the folds and wrinkles he’d collected in his face over the decades. I laughed and nodded to pretend i understood what the hell he was talking about. \n\n“So, shall we get started?” He asked. I nodded silently.  “First, your gloves. Gloves are like you second skin in this room, and you cannot do anything without your skin right?” He says with a chuckle. “N-no… i guess not.” I said with confusion as i washed my hands and slid on gloves. I didn’t understand him quite yet, but this was my first taste of his strange smilies and metaphors. \n\nOnce i was suited up and ready to work, he had me roll in the first cadaver. The wheel of the gurney squeaked as it glided across the linoleum tiles, and i could  how cold that metal was even through my thick gloves. It crossed my mind how uncomfortable it would be to lay on, but i suppose for the dead comfort doesn’t really matter. Dr. Gerber helped me lift the cadaver and place him on the exam table gently. He rolled a table full of tools between us and pulled a small recorder out of his pocket, and hit record. “Date; December third, 2010. Adult male, 52, Caucasian. Name: [redacted for privacy] No tattoos. Contusions on head, lividity also visible on back. This is constant with the scene.” He said. My job at this time was to silently hand him tools, tag and bag the bodies, and do some of the simpler paperwork after the fact.\n\nThis is the first time it happened. As Dr. Gerber was cutting into the chest of this man i heard a noise coming from one of the occupied cold lockers. It was a quick and faint groan. “What was that?” I asked as i turned my head to look at the lockers behind me. “Gas escaping the body. Pay attention to this.” He said quickly and sternly. This was quite the tone change from the upbeat old man he had been all day. “Sorry.” I muttered out of shame as i turned my head back to watch his work. He has the chest cavity open and is examining the state of the organs. “There appears to be some internal damage to the spleen and liver. Some internal bleeding. Consistent with the fall as described.” He said. \n\nThen i heard it again. Another slightly louder and longer groan. This one i swore it almost sounded like a groan of pain and anguish. “Sir, should we do something about that noise?’ I asked him, admittedly a little freaked out. Every scene from ever horror movie id ever seen up to that point was rolling through my mind. This made him slam the tools in his hand back on the tray with a metallic clash. He slammed them so hard even the resting tools jumped up in fear. He angrily turned off the recording device and got merely inches from me. “Hear me, boy. We’re doing important work here. If you’re easily distracted I’ll find someone who isn’t. When you hear the dead talking you better not listen, understand? Our work is to important for your eyes and ears to be running off.” He said with irritation seeping not his voice. His anger shocked me. He could go from a jovial old man to a person with an animalistic rage behind his eye at the drop of a dime. I sheepishly looked at my feet. “Yes, i understand, im sorry.” I apologized like a child be reprimanded by his father. “Good. I’m- im sorry for popping my lid. It’s just- i- you need to ignore things like that, boy. Okay?” He said with a friendly pat on my back. I smile at him and nod, wanting this uncomfortable confrontation to be behind us. Little did i know, however, that this would not be the end of this topic. \n\nThe *incident* happened roughly two weeks later. We got called in in the middle of the night to do a report of a poor woman, only 21 years old, who died under very mysterious circumstances. It’s neither here nor there to this story, but her boyfriend later admitted to poisoning the coffee he bought her because he thought she was cheating. \n\nAnyway, on the way to the morgue it started snowing, pretty damn hard. I made it there without a hitch and got inside to see that Dr. Gerber was nowhere to be found, so i used the office phone to give him a call. He answered after just two rings. \n\n“Hey Doc, where are ya?” I asked him lightheartedly. “Eric, boy. You’re not going to believe this. Some old coot T-boned me at the red light. He says he was distracted by the snow. Buy a snow globe if you’re that impressed by it….. Luckily though everyone is fine. You wont be seeing any of us on the examination table tonight haha!” He morbidly joked. “Oh okay, well im glad you’re safe and sound. do you need me to come pick you up?” I ask him. “No no, this kind young officer will bring me in after he assesses the scene. You can prep the deceased for tonight’s exam. Just make sure to stay focused and stay on task.” He warns me. “Ill do my best sir, see you soon.” I say with conviction before hanging up. \n\nI go to the cold lockers and pull out the victim to put on the gurney.  Her cloud blue eyes stare blankly up at me, her head fixed towards the ceiling. I accidentally plop her down a little too hard. I check the tag, make notes of how there are no immediate outward signs of trauma and roll her next to the examination table. I decide to wait until doctor gerber arrives to place her as to not drop her too hard again. So until he gets here i just sit in the office doing the necessary paperwork to prepare for tonight’s examination. \n\nThere i was in the office, the only audible noise is my pen scratching against the paper and a buzz coming from the fluorescent lights. I’m deep in focus when i hear a faint “huh?” I stop what im doing, thinking its doctor gerber. “Hello?” I call out to him. “H-hello?” I hear a faint and horse voice call back. This was not his voice. It sounded weak and feminine.  I got up from the desk chair and step out into the cold linoleum room, to see nothing. “Is someone in here?” I ask. I pause for a moment and hear no return to my call, so i shrug and go sit back down in the office.\n\n“I want to go home.” I hear the weak voice say. I slam my pen down, thinking this is some janitorial crews idea of a joke. I step out into the room again and see no one, but i notice the cadavers head is turned toward the office door, those lifeless milky eyes staring right in my direction. I couldn’t explain it, but it really felt like eye contact.  Something about this made my heart flutter with anxiety and the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I quickly half jog over to her and put her head upright. This is the first time where a body has freaked me out. I use the sides of the body bag to hold her in place so she wont move again. I shake off the eerie feeling so i can continue my work. \n\nOnly a few minutes go by when i hear the same weak voice, say this time still in just a whisper but with more desperation “please take me home. I don’t want to go back to the darkness.” I hesitantly get up from the safety of my chair and step after painstaking step walk just outside the door frame. That’s when my blood runs ice cold\n\nShes fucking sitting up. Those empty eyes staring at me and mouth gaping unnaturally wide. Her teeth are grey and gums are pain from no longer having blood flow. The blood and adrenaline pump through my veins harder than I’ve ever experienced.  Before I’m able to comprehend what’s happening before my very own eyes, i can hear the door slam shut behind me, and the gurney lurches forward to pin me between her and the door. Her thin, pale arms reach forward to grab me by the shoulders. “Don’t send me back Eric.” She begs as tears pour from her clouded eyes, i now notice they’re darting around, like she’s trying to figure out her surroundings . I don’t recall making a sound during this, but rewatching from watching the security footage im screaming. \n\n“It’s dark Eric, and cold. Everything is sorrow. Everything is suffering. Just a cold, black void of every bad feeling I’ve ever had. I miss my family. I miss light. I miss warm.” She says to me, with resentment growing in her voice with each word. I felt hot tears scream down my face, my arms were painfully cold where she was squeezing them. She ended up holding me so tight it left frail finger shaped bruises. “I- I can’t- I don’t know how to help you.” The words came out of my mouth without the permission of my mind. i was in shock, i still didn’t fully grasp the situation. I remember thinking that maybe she was still alive and the doctor made a mistake. \n\n“Vita ad vitaum. I cannot leave the cold place for nothing. It needs a soul to consume. It’s hungry. It eats and eats and eats for all of eternity, even when you think you have nothing left to to be consumed, it keeps eating. Leaving only your sorrows. like a Venus fly trap. It feeds on you, leaving behind only your despair. I need a soul to take the place of mine.” She says as she peels a cold hand off my shoulder and wraps it around my trachea. The pain of her small freezing hands around my neck was searing. I’ve never known cold so intense that it felt like a burn. “A life for a life. It’s hungry. You have more to feed it than i do. I only have anguish. Please, i want to feel again. Feel anything. Anything other than this.” she says as she grips tighter and tighter. \n\n\nAs my heart pounds in my chest i look at the cold tile room around me. This can’t be the place i die, it can’t. My mind suddenly snapped into focus as the will to live overtakes the fear that had paralyzed my body before I use my leg to kick over the gurney. It crashed into the tool tray with a loud crash and a fleshy plop as her body hits the floor. I catch my breath for a minute and cautiously take in the stillness after the metallic cacophony. *maybe she’s done. Maybe it finished her* i foolishly thought to myself. \n\nAfter what was only a couple seconds that felt like hours, she sat up from behind the gurney facing away from me. Every vertebrae in her back cracked loudly with her painstakingly slow movements.  With slow shaking movements she pulls herself up from the ground and stands up right. That’s when I notice the bone saw she held in her hand. She took a few heavy and uncoordinated steps towards me, growing quicker as she regains her orientation in her own body. Her mouth is still agape as clear fluids pour from her mouth and drip on the floor and black blood blood leaks from her nose. “I’m sorry Eric. I just can’t go back. I never want to go back. I want to go home.” She cries as she sprints towards me. I run into the office and lock the door behind me. The closest thing to shelter i could reach. \n\nI sit in the ground in the fetal position as i feel her jiggle the knob and pound with inhuman strength on the wooden door. I feel her try to cut through the wood with the tool but to no avail. She punched do has it causes my body to shake with each blow. I began crying at this point like a little kid. I felt there was no way I’m making it out of here. For a moment, the pounding stop. This made my heart race even harder. What could she be doing. Did she go outside to find another victim? Did she go back to whoever ever she came from? No, I knew that thought was naive to even entertain. \n\nMy thoughts were sharply interrupted by the shattering of glass above me. She punched out the frosted window in the door. I jump up and stand back to see her. Her pale, cracked lips and curled themself into an evil smile of victory. I watch as her hands sliced open as she pulled shards of glass out of her way piece by piece. The hand that she had just cut to ribbons is finally able to reach the lock. She unlocks and opens the door, holding the bone saw over her head. She begins slowly hobbling toward me. \n\nI grab Dr. Gerber’s laptop from the desk and with every bit of strength i have i hit her in the head with it, black congealed blood and grey brain matter splattering on the wall behind me as i pull away. Part of me hoped killing the brain would kill her, but part of me correctly knew that was foolish. She laughed as she touched the new found hole in her head and made her way toward me. She kicked me in the knee, hard. Causing me to collapse. She walks over to me and grabs me by the top of my hair. “If it wasn’t for that stunt i would have made this quick.” She hisses in my ear. she took the bone saw and slashed across my chest. I cried out in pain as blood began to stain my white coat.  She held the bone saw up to my throat, with enough force that the serrated points were ever so lightly beginning to draw blood. “You have much more for the void to feed on Eric. It’ll take its time with you, saver ever bit.” She says as she presses slightly harder. I began praying to anyone, anything to save me. Whatever forces of the universe existed i needed its help.\n\nRight as i thought it was the end, Dr. Gerber appeared in the doorway, revolver in hand.  He didn’t say a word, just blasted her head in. The force of the shot caused her to fall back and allowed me to get free. I ran to the old man and cowered behind him. “She’s dead. That wont stop her. She’s the cadaver.” I say quickly as i pull his arm in attempt to get him to run away. “I know that, boy.” He says as he shakes me off him. I hear a groan coming from the woman on the ground. There’s a fleshy void where her clouded eye once was and now black blood pours from it. \n\nAs she begins to get up Dr. Gerber pulls a lighter from his pocket and grabs the aerosol can of cleaner off the desk. He uses them to create a makeshift flame thrower and burns the woman. A high pitched screech leaves her mouth as what’s left of her soul exits the cadaver. She burned surprisingly fast. Her body turned to no more than ash in about 15 minutes. Dr. Gerber looks around the room, then back at me and in an exhausted voice mutters “You owe me a new laptop, boy.”\n\nWe clean up the mess, wash off the blood, collect parts of her skull that had been strewn around the room and start going through and erasing any evidence. “What did you mean you know it was the cadaver?” I asked him when i had a moment to begin processing what happened. “I told you boy, when the dead start talking you better not listen.” He says in a very matter of fact tone. I slammed the gallon of bleach i had been using to clean on the ground. “Dude what the fuck does that mean? I’m not in the mood for games right now i almost god killed by… by… god knows what!” I yell at him out of fear and anger. \n\nHe rolls over a chair and sits backwards in it. “Alright Eric, I’ll tell you. When some people die, not everyone but some, they’re not all the way gone. Somehow they’re able to muster up enough energy to used their mortal bodies and connect with the living again. And when they’ do, they’re angry. Or maybe resentful is a better word. They envy the living. They want us to take their place. They get more power when the cross over between the living and dead is acknowledged. It’s like your fear, empathy, curiosity or what have you, opens the door for them. This is why a corpses mouth is wired shut for a funeral. They’d be unstoppable if they began speaking in front of loved ones. They’re easier to ignore when they’re just a patient to us.” He explains somberly but calmly. Like the way your parents explain their divorced. This was the most serious the old man had ever been\n\n\n“That place she was talking about, the cold place… is it… real?” I ask ask hesitantly out of fear of the answer. He sighs. “I don’t know. It is for some. Not all are able to break the veil, but those that do say the same thing. A cold, dark, nothing eating away at them for eternity.” This sent a jolt of fear to my very core. The possibility of experiencing whatever turned that woman into a sadistic evil beast is truly my worst fear. “Who else knows about this?” I ask him. “Only people in the industry. ME’s, morticians, doctors, funeral directors. We keep it quiet because we don’t need the average joe messing with the powers beyond the wold of the living. To get in to the industry you have to sign an oath to keep it quiet and violating is punishable by death. And if there’s one thing a bunch of experts on the dead can do, its take you out and make it look like an accident.” He says gravely.  The way he said it makes me wonder if he’s ever had to make good on that promise himself before. \n\nThis was many years ago. The knowledge of this scared me off of my degree, and pushed me towards god. I dropped out of school to become a pastor at my local church. I stayed in touch with Dr. Gerber. He was like a father to me until his last day. I was even there with him when he died. It was last week on Thursday, 11;45 pm. When he passed on, I stayed with him. His wide had passed 5 months prior and he had no kids. How could you have kids knowing what he knows, knowing the fate they may be doomed to? I was heartbroken and crying while i held his hand. “Doc, im here. If you have something to say, say it.” I begged with a shake voice through tears. I got no reply, id like to think that means he went to a different place. A better place. \n\nI now spend my days focused on god. praying, worshiping, preaching. Hoping he will save me from that dark place. Like i said, I never finished my degree never had to sign and oath. So i post this to Reddit, hoping you all will take an old mans wise advice. If the dead start talking, you *better* not listen.",

        "text": "Back when I was in high school in the early 2010s, I bought all of my clothes from Target and JCPenney. My family wasn’t exactly poor, but Macy’s was definitely out of the question.\n\nSince most of the kids in my school were in the same boat, it was basically fine, but it didn’t stop me from lusting after the gowns I saw women wearing at the Oscars and the MTV music awards or whatever.\n\nSometimes, though, I’d go to the mall on the rich side of town and try shit on, just to know what it was like. They had a Nordstrom there, with racks of designer clothes going for two or three grand a pop. I’d try them on and pose for selfies in the dressing room and send them to my friends.\n\nUsually, I wouldn’t dare venture out of the dressing room, but sometimes I’d get bolder and walk around the store, vamping a little bit and taking videos.\n\nThe last time I ever did that was when I walked around a tall rack and bumped into a tall, thin man in a finely-tailored suit. With his high cheekbones and scraggly beard, he looked like he’d walked out of a catalog.\n\n“My apologies,” he said, taking a step back. “You should buy it, by the way. It’s stunning on you.”\n\nI looked down at the gown I’d chosen for the day. It was a sheer and white lace Dolce&amp;Gabbana evening gown that cost $6,050, on sale.\n\n“It’s a little more than I want to spend today,” I said, trying to play coy.\n\nHe laughed and took my hand.\n\n“Come with me,” he said, walking to the sales clerk. Then he laid a heavy-looking credit card on the table.\n\n“I… can’t,” I said.\n\n“Of course, you can,” he said. “And then you’ll wear it to lunch with me. Fair?”\n\nI felt like I was in a fairy tale. I accepted the offer.\n\nWe are at an upscale steakhouse a block down the street from the mall. I opened the menu to find cuts of wagyu more expensive than my family’s mortgage. I was planning to order a sashimi salad, but when the waiter came, the man ordered for me.\n\n“She’ll have the ribs,” he said. “And please remove her silverware.”\n\nThe waiter obeyed without comment.\n\nA few minutes later, a bottle of wine showed up. I wasn’t sure if I’d remembered him ordering it. He poured me a large glass.\n\n“I trust you’d had a cabernet before?” he asked.\n\nNot knowing what to say, I nodded. In truth, I’d never even tried wine that didn’t come out of a box, and that was only once at my friend Gabriella’s quinceanera.\n\n“The best practice with an older vintage like this would be to decant it for a few hours, but given our limited time, we’ll have to improvise a bit. Here, swirl it like this.”\n\nHe raised his glass to the light and swirled the wine gently. I tried to do the same, but the wine barely moved. I was scared that if I moved it too much, the wine would destroy the terrifyingly expensive gown.\n\n“You’re timid,” he said. “I enjoy that about you. My intention was to agitate the wine, not you. Please go ahead and drink.”\n\nI took a sip, trying to feel sophisticated, but all I could really taste was the alcohol.\n\n“You should be careful,” he said after a minute. “Certain men. Certain evil men would do all kinds of things to a tipsy girl if they got the chance.”\n\nHe stared into his wine glass, still swirling it furiously. Finally, he took a drink.\n\n“Sometimes even good men do the wrong thing,” he added. “I’m sure you know all about that, though. I’m sure the boys in your class have taken their shots.” He took a long breath in and finished his glass. “But you. I can tell you’re a good girl. I bet those boys beg and beg for it, and you just keep telling them no.”\n\n“I think I should go,” I said quietly, my body starting to tense. “I told my mom I’d–”\n\n“Your mother will be fine,” he said, topping off his glass and adding a splash more to mine. “It would be a shame if you didn’t finish your drink. And your food isn’t even here yet.”\n\nI took another sip as a waiter approached with the plate of ribs. I couldn’t help but notice he hadn’t ordered anything from himself.\n\n“Forgive me, I’m on a diet,” he said. “But please, do go ahead and eat.”\n\n“But how do I…?” I looked down at the plate of ribs, wishing he hadn’t removed my silverware.\n\n“Do be careful not to soil that dress,” he said. Then he took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and passed it to me. “Please, allow me. As a gentleman, I must insist.”\n\nI wondered what might happen if I ran. In my mind, a scenario played out where I sprinted for the door, only for him to catch up to me, pressing me into some dark booth where he’d rip the dress from my body, forcing himself on me as the waitstaff pretended nothing was happening.\n\n“Eat,” he said, all kindness drained from his voice.\n\n“If I could just…”\n\n“Do remember our agreement,” he said, his eyes boring into me. His gaze warned of consequences. “I heard about a girl who came to this very restaurant just a few weeks ago, even younger than you. She told her date she had to go to the bathroom, but instead, she ran away. They found her body just a few days later, knifed a hundred different ways, barely a drop of blood left in her.”\n\nI felt my breathing quicken and my vision blurred. I put a hand down to steady myself from falling over. I imagined what it might feel like to be stabbed over and over again.\n\nHe leaned forward, and whispered, his breath smelling of fresh vanilla.\n\n“I would be disappointed if you broke our arrangement. But not *that* disappointed.”\n\nTimidly, I picked up a rack of ribs and tore it into pieces as gently as I could, but my hands were a mess. Even with my life on the line, I couldn’t help but keep looking at my white dress, trying to make sure I didn’t dirty it.\n\nI pressed the flesh to my lips and ate methodically. His breathing quickened as he watched me.\n\n“More,” he demanded. And as he said it, a single drop of sauce dribbled off my hand, staining my dress at the hip. The damage was done.\n\nIn life, there are moments when you just say fuck it and do your thing. And this, honestly, was my first Fuck It moment. If he wanted to watch me eat, I decided to let him.\n\nAnd so I did. I ate. Rib after rib. My face and hands got filthy. I sipped wine between bites, choking down the meat until I’d emptied both my plate and my glass.\n\nThen, finally, when everything was gone I stopped and took the napkin, wiping my hands and face.\n\nThe man looked over at me.\n\n“You were incredible,” he said. “A complete surprise. Truly. I’ll never forget you.”\n\nHe reached down and opened his leather satchel, removing a small wooden box.\n\n“The napkin, please,” he said, and I handed it to him.\n\nHe opened the box to reveal a red velvet interior. Then, carefully, like he was handling a work of art at a gallery, he gently took the napkin and placed it inside, before resealing the box carefully.\n\n“Can I go now?” I asked, but he didn’t respond. He just stared at the box, transfixed. I stood and walked slowly out of the restaurant, but when I hit the street, I broke into a run. I didn’t stop until I reached my car, tears streaming down my face.\n\nI picked up the phone, thinking I’d call my mom, but instead I dialed 911.\n\n*What is your emergency?*\n\n“I just got robbed,” I screamed, hysterical. “I just got robbed!”\n\n“Can you please detail what’s been stolen?” asked the operator.\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. “I don’t know.”\n\nAnd I still don’t.",

        "text": "First of all, I am pretty sure superpowers are not a symptom of food poisoning. \n\nThese are the indicators according to the CDC website. And below them are the symptoms my friends have experienced:\n\nDiarrhea\n\nStomach pain or cramps\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nFever\n\nLevitating (?)\n\nMoving things with your mind (?)\n\nSetting things on fire (?)\n\nDeath/Rebirth into something I cannot wrap my head around (?)\n\n\nAll in that order depending on the severity of the side-effects.\n\nYes, I am serious. I’m currently writing to you in an odd situation, so typos will exist. I’m not in the current position to edit, I just want to get all of this down before either my phone dies or I mysteriously disappear. \n\nI have limited time so I’m just going to get into it. I am twenty three years old. I’m a student living in the city, and I can’t cook. \n\nI’ve never been able to cook, and I didn’t really care until my work colleagues pointed it out. I’ve been happy living on cup ramen and hot pockets. Not exactly healthy, but it’s quick and easy. Better than takeout, I guess. Anyway, knowing I am a shit cook, I figured I should do something about it before 2023. I don’t want to start a new year still being inept at a basic life skill. I watch a lot of Youtubers and podcasts—and all of them at some point have recommended the company Hello Fresh. \n\nTheir commercials looked pretty good. I mean, the food looked easy to make and healthy. They made my mouth water. It was always some kind of chicken dripping in a white sauce, sprinkled with vegetables and light garnish. Seeing Hello Fresh ads made me hate my own crummy diet.\n\nAccording to the website, as well as their influencer spokespeople, it was fresh food made easy. Which was perfect for me. I am not usually one for dinner parties or parties in general, but I guess you could say I wanted… guinea pigs to taste my cooking. I know that sounds shady, but it was innocent I swear. I just wanted people to taste my food and not make a face. I still had slight trauma from when I was fifteen and made my parents spaghetti. \n\nThey didn’t even eat it, just sticking their noses up at it. Granted, I don’t think I’d cooked the meatballs through, and the onions weren’t supposed to be chunks. So, 9 years later, I was determined to make a good impression on my friends. They were less blunt than my parents. Instead of telling me how it was, my friends would smile politely and tell me at least I was trying. Which was good enough for me. I will say I didn’t initially want to experiment with them. The whole thing  started off as a date. I had been casually talking to a girl I liked for a while. Mina.\n\nI met her in class, and friendship turned into something more. It was just flirting followed by real feelings which started to blossom. I asked her out a few weeks ago on the way to class, and I was so nervous I almost spewed coffee. Mina was that kind of girl. The type which got me nervous. \n\nCute, but kind of pretentious. She gave off that vibe anyway. With her studying Canadian cinema, I guessed she was some kind of movie buff judging from her obsession with quoting like these super old timey movies and books. Once we started talking, however, I had quickly realised she was a total dork. Exactly the same as me. With the same sense of humor. \n\nBefore the holidays, she asked if I wanted to go out for dinner—you know, like a fancy restaurant. But I had a better idea. (I mean, it seemed good at the time). I didn’t have the heart to tell her I was broke after spending way too much on Christmas presents. I knew a Starbucks salary wasn’t going to cut it, but my family are the type of people to silently judge if you give them something within a decent prize range (10-20 dollars)\n\nSo, I had an idea.\n\nI would kill two birds with one stone. Get to know the girl I liked and test out my culinary skills with a Hello Fresh kit I had ordered. Though once it was delivered, I chickened out. I don’t know if it was first-date jitters or I was terrified of giving Mina food poisoning. So, I roped some of my colleagues into coming along. And thus, it became less of a date and more of an awkward dinner party. It was supposed to be a casual after-holidays dinner party. \n\nEven if we were still stuck in that weird purgatory gap between the 26th December and New Year’s day. Just friends (a potential girlfriend) and drinks. That is what it was supposed to be. Your average Gen Z get together where you talk shit and drink way too much, and then spend hours reminiscing and cringing at your younger years. I had known my colleagues for almost three years, and they were maybe my only two friends I fully talked to. \n\nMainly because we shared mutual interests. We watched the same Streamers and podcasts, sharing the same stupid humor. Just like Mina. Except with Mina, I didn’t send her questionable memes at 4am.\n\nI had meant to run through the recipe before my guests arrival, but being the great friends they were, my colleagues decided to head to my place two hours early. They said it was to help me set up and be so-called moral support, but I was pretty sure they were there to watch the fire. Literally and figuratively. I decided to make something easy-ish. I originally just chose chicken on its own with sauce but was told that was too boring—and apparently Mina would think I was an actual psychopath for serving her that. \n\nSo, after scrolling through the website and overthinking every single recipe I saw, I finally decided on one. Crispy cheddar chicken, bacon mash potatoes, and asparagus.\n\nSimple enough, right? I had meticulously read through the instructions. Hello Fresh actually sends you all the ingredients already weighed and accumulated. So, all you really have to do is put them all together and cook them. Mina had been excitedly texting me all day which was giving me at least some confidence. I really hoped she would turn up before my unhinged colleagues. \n\nNo such luck. \n\nFairyTale Of New York was on the radio for the fourth time, when I was buzzing around my small apartment kitchen, already sweating through the dress I regretted putting on early. The chicken was already cooking, \n\nthe asparagus was ready to be thrown in the pan, and I was staring at the little baggie of grated cheese poking from the Hello Fresh package about to fall off of the countertop, when my broken doorbell rang, which was just loud enough to hear if I cranked down the radio. Maisie, my three year old Tabby, hates noise. She hates humans. Tolerates other cats, and family members. But strangers were where she fully drew the line. Masie had met my colleagues twice. Both times she tried to scratch their eyes out when they tried picking her up.  I caught the fast-moving blur of her tail swiftly diving upstairs as I power walked to the door, wiping my clammy hands on the front of my dress. \n\nYanking it open, I came face to face with Gabe, who was casually leaning against my door, the holiday decorations I had strung across my windows illuminating a sardonic smile already quirking on his lips. \n\nAs usual, the two of them looked like they had just rolled out of bed. Which suited them. I don’t think they would ever pull off actual fancy outfits. Gabe was front and centre, while Charlie lurked behind him, his gaze glued to his phone. I noticed Gabe was still wearing his Starbucks apron under his jacket. Gabe and Charlie had been mistaken as twins multiple times. \n\nI could see it. They had fairly similar facial structures and dark brown hair, but while Gabe was an extroverted joker with a strong Boston accent, Charlie was a soft spoken Brit who we had to force into social situations.\n\nPeering at me through thick strands of dark hair, Gabe cocked his head. A cigarette was curled between his lips. He took a drag, exhaling smoke in my face. “Good evening to the girl who doesn’t know how to make basic meals attempting to have a whole ass dinner party.”\n\nI could tell from the slight snorts between the cigarette, he’d been waiting to say that line all day.\n\nInstead of replying, I nodded to his odd clothing choice. “You’re still wearing your work uniform?”\n\nHe shrugged, his cheeks going a little pink. “I forgot to take it off.” Nudging Charlie, the guy took another drag. “Someone was rushing the last orders.”\n\nCharlie shoved him back. “Behave.” He said, shooting me a smile. “Are you excited?”\n\n“Terrified.” I admitted.\n\n“Relax!” Gabe handed over bright yellow bag,  grabbing my shoulders gently. “We’re here so you don’t burn down your house.”\n\n“Ignore him.” Charlie rolled his eyes, pocketing his phone. “We’re here to help.” He nodded at me reassuringly. “Everything okay so far?”\n\nMy ideal scenario was to have the boys arrive last. Dinner would be ready by then, and they wouldn’t have to open their mouths. I could tell Gabe had foreseen this—and was determined for the exact opposite to happen. I don’t think he was trying to ruin the night, but definitely wanted to make sure things didn’t go squeaky clean. I was 100% sure he was ready to tell Mina my most embarrassing stories—and alcohol would induce that. It was too late to send them away. I had already told Mina they were tagging along. So, I was going to grin and bear it.\n\nI took the gift with a smile. “Convenience store wine?”\n\nGabe winked. \"The very best five dollar Vino we could find.\"\n\nIf we were at work behind the Starbucks counter, I would have hit him by now. But I was trying to stay calm and collected for Mina’s arrival. So, I took the wine with a gritted smile, knowing damn well I was going to make him pay for it once we started work again in the new year.\n\n“Thank you.” I gestured inside. “Come on in!”\n\nThe two of them followed by inside. In true Charlie fashion he went to hunt down Maisie. He was probably the only human besides me she could maybe tolerate if he didn’t overly stroke her. While Gabe made himself useful, setting up the table. \n\nThe two of us vibed to Christmas music. He still wasn’t taking off his apron. I was starting to think he liked wearing it. \n\n“So, who is this Mina girl?” Gabe set down four plates, side-stepping to a pop song. I was leaning against the counter, frowning at the Hello Fresh instructions. According to them, everything should have been going okay. Though I was worried about the asparagus. It hadn’t specified whether I needed to roast or boil them.\n\n“She’s just someone I met in class,” I said, peering closer at the instructions. There was a weird side section at the back written in a language I couldn’t understand. I shot Gabe a look. “And you’re not going to embarrass me in front of her, okay? Don’t start talking about weird stuff.”\n\nHis lip quirked. “Weird stuff?\n\n“Memes.” I said, folding my arms. “The pool-filling videos you make me watch. Those slime Tik-Toks you're obsessed with.”\n\nGabe scoffed. “You watch them too!”\n\n“Yeah, but I don’t want Mina to know that!” Grabbing a fork, I pointed at him, prongs first. “Also. Don’t smoke in front of her.”\n\nGabe pulled a face, leaning across the table. “Have you ever considered that maybe Mina likes talking about all that stuff?” He straightened up. “Be honest.” My friend said, his gaze flicking to the food in the oven. Gabe folded his arms across his apron. “Is this going to kill me?”  \n\nI handed him two glasses to put down. “You wanted to come.”  \n\nThe boy sent me a look. “You blackmailed me with cash.”\n\n“Which you took.”\n\nCharlie, who was sitting on the stairs playing with a wary Maisie, scoffed. “She paid you? I was threatened! With my life!”\n\nGabe was surprisingly helpful. He filled glasses and kept an eye on the food for me. “How old is she again?”\n\n“Twenty five.” I muttered. “Which, compared to us, is basically a fully grown adult. So, like I said. No jokes or memes or talking about weird shit.” I turned back to the Hello Fresh instructions. Something about the language at the very back was causing a thrumming pain in my temples. \n\nDumping them back in the box, I turned back to him. He had taken a seat at the table. His eyes were stuck to his phone, a smile curving on his lips. I didn’t bother questioning what he was looking at. \n\nCharlie joined us a while later, and had successfully managed to tame Maisie, who hopped onto his lap when he slumped down next to Gabe. I made a last minute plea to both of them to not act strange, or saying anything weird, or mention any embarrassing stories.\n\nWhen Mina arrived, the food was ready, and we were all in high spirits. I don’t know what I expected from Mina. I only knew the version of her in classes; the version whose gaze was glued to her books, only talking to me in whispers. Sociable Mina was a totally different person. She arrived in a casual dress. Just a sweater and jeans. The guys didn’t even have to say anything fucked up, because the second she walked in, Mina was already showing them her phone and laughing before even greeting them.\n\nI was surprised at how easy the four of us had come together.  After getting to know the guys, she insisted on helping me serve the food, telling us stories about her travels at a kid. With Mina being part Thai, she had a lot to tell us—and she spared no details while we ate.\n\n“So, Mina.” Gabe spoke up, spooning potatoes into his mouth. I could tell by his smile he was about to say weird shit.\n\nI kicked him under the table, but he just cleared his throat and swiped at his lips with a napkin and asked her generic questions.\n\nWhen Mina pulled out a pack of cigarettes and asked if she could smoke outside, Gabe sent me a knowing smile.\n\nHe was right. But I was never going to admit that. Besides, I was having a great time. The food was good. Really good. It didn’t exactly look like the image on the instruction manual. More of a squashed version. But the taste was amazing. I didn’t realise how hungry I was until I was shovelling bacon mash potatoes into my mouth like an animal. I served pumpkin pie and whipped cream for dessert. \n\nThe pie was kind of soggy, but I could mask it with the cream. I didn’t plan anything after dessert. I guess I expected them to go home. Mina, however, was already making herself at home. She wandered into my lounge and slumped onto my couch, turning on my TV. She wanted to watch a holiday movie (Elf) so we figured why not. It was cosy. \n\nMina was still telling her stories, cuddled up to me, while Gabe and Charlie sat on the rug. They reminded me of little kids, the two of them sitting shoulder to shoulder. Charlie had Maisie curled up on his lap, Gabe with his legs drawn to his chest, chin resting on his knees. It struck me that I wouldn’t mind living with the three of them in the New Year. They were quite the catch. It wasn’t until halfway through the movie when Mina’s stories died out and her attention went to the TV.\n\nI didn’t think anything of it until she sat up a little straighter. I noticed she was… hot. Not uncomfortably hot. But I could feel the heat coming off of her. I tried to ignore it, but then she was clearly uncomfortable, wriggling next to me before finally jumping up, fashioning a smile. In the dim glow of the TV screen, her cheeks were significantly paler. “Where’s your bathroom?” She asked hurriedly. I could tell she was eager to get away.\n\nInstantly, my mind went to food poisoning. Mina’s forehead was glistening with sweat, her breaths coming out short and panicky.\n\n“Bathroom.” She said again when I couldn’t find the words.\n\n“Oh, right.” I sat up, my own stomach galloping. Not from poisoning though. Nerves. “It’s down the hall.” I said. “Are you okay?”\n\nMy tone must have attracted the boy’s attention. Charlie looked up from his phone, twisting to face us. “You okay, Mina?”\n\nMina had told me in private that she suffered from anxiety. The more people asked if she was okay, the worse she felt.\n\nShe nodded, still smiling, making her way over to the door. “Yeah, I’m fine! I think I just ate too much.”\n\n“Shh!” Gabe’s attention was glued to the TV. He had no filter, especially after a glass of wine. “It’s the best part.”\n\nI kicked him again.\n\n“Ow.”\n\nGabe didn’t turn away from the screen.\n\nMina laughed at him, but I could tell from the crease between her brows, the curl in her lip, that she was in pain.\n\n“Down the hall on the right.” I told her again. I made a move to get up and follow her. “Are you sure you’re okay?”\n\n“Yep!” She swiped at her forehead. “I’m okay. I just need… I think I just need some air.”\n\nBefore I could question her, Mina was disappearing down the hallway. \n\nFrom the stumbling footsteps, I could tell she was running.\n\nFuck.\n\nMy mouth went dry.\n\nI started to second guess myself. The chicken was cooked, right? I’d checked it multiple times. I turned to my phone, already googling food poisoning symptoms and counting how long it had been since she ingested the meal. Maybe an hour? But I felt fine. My stomach was trying to projectile into my throat, but I was pretty sure that it was nerves. I didn’t want to ask the guys how they were feeling, because surely that would cause alarm bells. \n\nSo, with sticky palms and dread coiling in the root of my gut, I leaned into the warm leather of my couch and counted the minutes until Mina came back. She did, eventually. \n\nWhen Mina sat down she was shaking, her hands trembling in her lap. But still, she shot me a grin and insisted she was okay. Mina definitely was not okay. Her cheeks were pallid white, strands of her dark hair sticking to her clammy forehead. The girl was sweating. \n\nBad. \n\nWhen she shuffled uncomfortably next to me, I could feel sweat dripping from her sweater. Her head found my shoulder, and it should have been comfortable. Flirty. But Mina was clearly sick. I couldn’t understand why she was hiding it. The movie credits were rolling when Charlie lifted Maisie off of his lap with a groan. “Alright. I am in need of more wine.”\n\nGently settling my startled looking cat on the carpet, the brit  jumped to his feet, turning to us. “Want some?”\n\nHe stumbled, almost toppling over. I thought it was the wine. But like Mina, Charlie was visibly shaking.\n\nOpening my mouth to answer him, something warm crept back up my throat. Charlie was sweating. Bad. I could see the sheen of sweat shining on his forehead and cheek. Movement must have sobered him up, because suddenly he didn’t look well at all. His smile softened a little when he noticed my face. “Actually…” He laughed lightly, dragging a hand through his hair. I could tell he was trying to downplay it, but it was growing increasingly more obvious that something had gone very wrong with my meal. “I’m actually not feeling that great, Luce.”\n\nI nodded, swallowing hard. “Are you okay?”\n\nHe shrugged. “Just feeling sick and shaky.” Charlie was doing his best not to ask the question, but I knew it was choking his throat.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve got some pretty bad stomach cramps.” Gabe tipped his head back, his lips splitting into a grin. “Are you 100% sure that chicken was cooked? Because if not, we’re in for a rocky few days. I had food poisoning as a kid. Not pretty. My ma thought I was dying.”\n\nThere it was. Gabe was the blunt one so I was expecting it from him.\n\n“Don’t talk about throwing up.” Mina spoke up with a sicky smile. “I really don’t feel good. I should probably… go home.”\n\nShe made a move to get up, but I stopped her. “Do you need me to call someone?”\n\n“No.” Mina whispered. But I wasn’t sure if she could stand up without projectiling from both ends. The girl was sitting stiff in a certain position, her head straight. She shook her head. “No, I’ll be okay. Just… no sudden movements.” She blinked rapidly. “I feel kinda dizzy.”\n\nDizziness.\n\nWas dizziness a symptom of food poisoning? I wasn’t sure if it was.\n\nGabe jumped up suddenly, and next to me, Mina’s stomach made an odd noise. He didn’t speak, darting out of the room. I heard the bathroom door slam. Charlie seemed a little less sick. He grabbed Mina a glass of water, and thankfully, she managed to drain the whole glass. I think Charlie was in denial that he too was sick. \n\nThe boy could barely hold his own glass of water. The two of them engaged in casual conversation while I called an Uber. Gabe had been in the bathroom for a while. I’d found myself standing outside waiting for him, but both times I had asked if he was okay, I just got a strangled response telling me to leave. \n\nMina was on her third glass of water when I left her and Charlie to see if Gabe was finished. I didn’t hear barfing. Which was good, right? But when I neared the door, however, I could hear the faucet was on. I already knew what he was doing. \n\nGabe was trying to mask the sound of his violent puking by blasting the faucet. I only had to press my ear against the hardwood of the door to hear retching and groaning, the sounds of him yelling obscenities into the toilet bowl.\n\n“Gabe?”\n\n“Go away!” He yelled. His voice was different. I’d never heard him sound like that. His voice was strained and croaky. He sounded scared.\n\nI should have left him alone. I know that. But he could have needed the hospital.\n\nTwisting the door handle, I pulled it open and braced myself for what I was about to see. Gabe was kneeling on cold tiles, bent over the toilet bowl. His back was to me, fingers gripping the bowl. \n\nThe boy was shaking violently with every heave wracking his body. Gasping out, my friend groaned. “Didn’t I tell you to leave?” He snapped. I knew he was about to yell at me before he jolted again, his shoulders relaxing. \n\nI figured he was finished  before he slowly turned around, wide eyes going to the ceiling. At first I thought he was dizzy, struggling to keep his balance. Before he collapsed against the toilet with a choked laugh. Gabe’s gaze was skirting the ceiling tiles, and after a moment of trying to ignore a glittering in his pupils, something which looked almost sentient, alive, wriggling around his iris—I followed his eye.\n\nThere was something floating above me. Right over my head. Initially, I thought it was a Christmas decoration which was hanging from the ceiling. That is what logic said, anyway. But the closer I looked, I realised I was staring at… liquid. Worse still, I could still see undigested lumps of chicken. Barf. I was seeing Gabe’s barf spiralling above me like a fucking attraction. There were no strings attached, it was just hovering there. Like it belonged.\n\nI was almost trance-like, staring at this thing in the air, this thing that didn’t make sense, before my friend turned back to the toilet seat, this time speaking through sharp breaths. “I’m okay.” He hissed out. \n\nExcept this time he barfed, bright red escaped his mouth, dribbling down his chin, and he collapsed over the toilet seat. “Okay.” Gabe slurred in a laugh which choked into a sob.  \n\nHis body jolted again, and with him, so did the room. I wasn’t imagining it. The room began to shake and tremble, shampoo bottles raining down from the shelves. I thought it was an earthquake until Gabe hung onto the toilet bowl, squeezing hard. He twisted around to face me with wide eyes. His frenzied gaze found the corner of the bathroom, and bottles of my body wash were exploding, colourful froth spattering the walls. Before it found the shower, the nozzle growing a mind of its own, twisting itself up the wall before dropping back onto the tiles.\n\nGabe turned back to the bowl, hissing out a breath. “I don’t think I’m okay, Luce. Fuck. I think you need to… to get someone.”\n\nAs soon as the words had left his mouth, the room stopped shaking.  I was quick to soak towels in cold water. Ignoring spiralling red spattering the porcelain white of the toilet bowl, I struggled to press them onto his forehead. “I’m going to get you help, okay?” I managed to get out.\n\n“Mmm. Just gimme a sec.” Gabe slurred. “I’m okay. I’m gonna be…” He hiccupped, more red hitting white. “I’m gon be okay.”\n\nI could barely breathe.\n\n“How are you doing that?” I whispered.\n\nGabe’s gaze flicked to the state of the bathroom, to tiles still lightly quivering under my feet. “I have no idea. But… fucking cool, right?\" He blinked slowly, and the faucet exploded. When his eyes rolled back, his body going limp against the toilet seat, I found myself stiff. I couldn’t move.\n\nI couldn’t speak. Gabe wasn’t moving. His skin was shining with sweat. He was so pale. So, fucking pale.\n\n“Charlie!” I didn’t realise I was screaming. I was numb.\n\n“Charlie, I need help!” I wailed.\n\nFuck.\n\nWas he dead? Had I killed him?\n\nNo, I couldn’t have killed him! It wasn’t me. I cooked the chicken! And even if didn’t… since when was food poisoning… this?!\n\n“Mina!”\n\nCharlie’s panicked voice cut through my thoughts, and I snapped out of it. I waited for several painstaking moments waiting for Gabe to move—to tell me he was still alive. He did. But not in the way I wanted. Instead, his body writhed, jolting erratically. \n\nAnd with that movement came one final quake under my feet. I couldn’t call that a sign that he was still alive, but it was something. Slowly, I made my way over to him. He was still breathing. But his heartbeat was erratic. Putting him in the recovery position, I noticed his skin was ice-cold. It’s weird. Like his body was dead. His face was white, slight bruising under his eyes. But Gabe still had a pulse. \n\nHe was alive, and yet it made no sense how he was alive. So much blood. It painted him and the toilet bowl. When I left him, his arms were twitching beneath him, fingers curling into a fist. I was diving for my bag and phone to call an ambulance, when I noticed something was very wrong. \n\nCharlie was on his knees, coughing violently into blood soaked hands, and Mina lying on her back. Her eyes were flickering, lips opening and closing, a thin line of red seeping down her chin. But looking closer, her body wasn’t quite on the floor. No. It was… hovering. Levitating. Several feet from my favourite rug.\n\nMina was unresponsive. When I shook her, tried to pull her back to the ground, her body seemed to shake me off.\n\n“Charlie.” I spoke softly, already dialling 911 with trembling hands. “What… what happened to her?”\n\nHis next cough exploded from him. And the tissue paper he was spluttering into burst into startling orange.\n\nFlame. I stared for a moment, unsure if what I was seeing… was real.\n\nNo, it was real. I was seeing ignited smoulders of orange tearing through white tissue paper.\n\nI found Charlie’s unfocused eyes. There was something alive around his iris. Something twining its way around his pupil.\n\n“I’m okay.” He said hurriedly. “Just feeling dizzy.”\n\nI almost laughed. 911 was taking a while to connect, and I found myself wondering how. It shouldn’t have taken that long.\n\n“Dizzy?!” I hissed, gesturing to the flickering flame between his fingers.\n\n It took me a second to realise blurry orange was writhing across the tips of his fingers. I don’t think he was fully aware of what was happening. “You can see it too?” His eyes widened, and his head cocked, eyes illuminated orange light flickering across mesmerising flame crawling across his flesh. “Well, shit.”\n\nHe choked out a laugh, swaying slightly.  “I thought I was tripping.” Another bloody cough spluttered from his lips. Behind me, the holiday decorations I had strung across the wall burst into flames. Everything happened in slow motion, and somehow I was reacting like I knew what was going on. \n\nGrabbing a glass of water, I put the mini fire out with the phone pressed to my ear. I didn’t see Charlie’s knees hit the ground. I didn’t see him drop to the ground. Instead, I was pacing the room, desperate to get to the emergency services. Even when there was no way to explain what I had seen. This wasn’t food poisoning. It couldn’t be. This was way more advanced than a virus.  When a woman’s friendly voice finally sliced into my ear, a shiver rocketed down my spine.  A thud made me jump.\n\nMina had hit the ground, gravity finally yanking her body down. I crawled over to her. She was alive. Just freezing cold.\n\n“Hello! You’re speaking to Katy at Hello Fresh! Can I have your home address, please?”\n\nWhat? Didn’t I call 911? I didn’t have time to question it. Before I could choke down the words, I was breaking out into a sob. “\n\n“There’s something wrong with my friends.” I managed to get out. “There’s…. there’s something wrong with my friends!” \n\nClutching the phone to my ear, I tried to pry Mina’s eye open. Several feet away, Charlie was completely out. “I think they’re dead.” I whispered in a hiss. “Did I kill them? It was just a chicken recipe. But I can’t understand…” My chest felt like it was on fire. “They’re not experiencing… normal symptoms.” I couldn’t stop myself from crying, then. “Can you help them? There’s something wrong. My friends…\"\n\nThe woman hummed. She seemed remarkably calm. “No, they’re not dead,” she said. “This is just the ingesting phase. Following that is the Blossoming phase.” Katy paused and cleared her throat. “Which we have appeared to have gone wrong. Please provide your home address.”\n\n“What?” I shrieked. “Why do you want my address?”\n\n“For pick-up and extraction.” She said. “How old are they? Are these family members, or are they around your age?”\n\n“I—”\n\nShe cut me off. “Just the age category is fine.”\n\nAt the corner of my eye, Charlie’s body writhed for a few seconds, and next to him, fibres of carpet began to slowly catch alight.\n\nI stamped it out. “18 to 25.” I told her. “What do you mean, extraction? What’s wrong with them?” I swallowed. “Are they dead?!”\n\n“Just blossoming.” Katy said. “I advise you to stay away from them. If you are in the room with them now, I would like you to step out. Do not make any sudden movement. If they are experiencing any physical symptoms, please restrain your friends with rope with rope.\"\n\nI could feel myself taking slow steps back.\n\n“What are you… talking about? You did this?”\n\n“Yes. The food your friends ingested is the cause of their current symptoms. I’m talking about the blossoming stage. After ingesting, their bodies will go into a sort of… hibernation, by either going to sleep or simply sitting or standing. They will not be showing any emotion, due to second stage taking over their brain. They may utter speech but it will be slurred or incomprehensible. Laughing has also been reported.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?”\n\n“I mean…” Katy paused. “Your friends… they won’t exactly be themselves when they break from the blossoming stage.”\n\n“They’re dead?”\n\n“Well… yes and no. Not dead in the brain.”\n\nAnother step back.\n\nHer words weren’t registering.\n\nIn front of me, Mina’s head jerked from side to side, her eyes snapping open, lips curling into an animalistic snarl revealing incisors which definitely weren’t there before. I took a slow breath and took slow steps, backing away towards the door. “Why is this happening to them?”\n\n“Well, miss—”\n\nI cut her off with a frustrated cry. Mina’s dead eyes were on the ceiling. “No, I mean why is it happening to them and not me?”\n\n“Well, I can’t speak for you. I know we have been testing a placebo in control group subjects, but I don’t think its been put into our products,” she said. “As for your friends, there have been reports of a certain… mutation in subjects who consume our products. It is known to cause significant changes in brain patterns. Of course, we knew this. The chemical was intentionally put into our food to create a certain reaction which would not be harmful but help us in the long run. What we hoped for is for customers to become our spokespeople for Hello Fresh.” \n\nGod, I could tell she had said that line so many times. “However, something has indeed gone wrong. Over the last few weeks, we have received multiple reports of this mutation which I can assure we can control. Please do not worry. We will extract them ASAP. Oh! And if you check the instructions we sent you with your kit, we very clearly warned customers of this mutation. We cannot offer a refund.”\n\nShe was joking around. \n\nSurely.\n\nKaty left me in silence before hitting me with a bombshell. “This mutation is rare, by the way. Most customers, such as social media influencers, have been affected in a positive way. We have spokespeople to carry our name with them and spread our product globally.”  \n\n“Spokespeople?” I bit out. “My friend was floating.” The words felt foreign on my tongue. “My friend… she was hovering in front of me!”\n\n“Mmm. Like I said, significant changes in brain patterns include symptoms such as usual flu like symptoms, like vomiting and a fever. As well as bleeding from the nose and mouth, a sudden inexplicable urge to consume human flesh, abilities that cannot be explained, and —-“\n\nKaty’s voice exploded into nothing when something smashed into the back of my head, sending me spiralling.\n\nThe smell of fried onions, as well as a sharp, intense pain writing in the palms of my hands woke me up.\n\nI found myself lying on my back on my dining room table. When I tried to move, tried to get up, I couldn’t. I twisted my head to seek out where the pain was coming from. The first thing I saw through frayed vision was the wooden edge of the knife trembling mid-air. Blinking rapidly, I thought I was hallucinating. Nope. \n\nThe knife was definitely real, and definitely suspended in mid-air. Panic started to ignite inside of me—and before I could speak, the air was moving in front of me. Suddenly, the knife wasn’t as clumsy as I thought it was. It didn’t tremble and shake. It cocked to the left and then the right. Like it could sense my fear. There was a figure blooming behind the knife. \n\nGabe. \n\nHe looked… better. I guessed. There was something fucked with his eyes, but he didn’t look dead anymore. At least that was my logical brain talking. It wasn’t fully registering dead and empty eyes, and a grinning mouth full of teeth ready to rip me apart. I finally found my voice when Mina loomed over me with wide, unseeing eyes. “You’re okay.” I rasped when Mina’s tongue flicked out, grazing her lips. \n\nShe was stiff. When I tried to move, her claw-like fingernails grasped hold of me, like I was territory. The girl didn’t speak. She just shook her head. Gabe didn’t look at me. His gaze was on my legs and arms. I glimpsed a thin slither of drool pooling from his lip.\n\n “Hungry.” He mumbled. “So… hungry.”\n\n“There’s something wrong with you.” I said. “I’m getting help. Listen to me. Okay? I’m going to get you help.”\n\nHis eyes seemed to flicker to life.\n\n“Oh no, I’m perfectly fine,” Gabe shrugged with a smile. “I’m just… really fucking hungry, Luce. We’re all hungry.”\n\n“Mmm.” Charlie mumbled, echoing his words. “Hungry.”\n\n“Let me go.” I wrenched against the pain holding me.  “Let me go!”\n\n“Shh.”\n\nGabe only had to blink  before a carving knife was hovering inches from my face. “You need to eat, Luce.” His lips broke out into a grin. “And then we’re eating you.”\n\nBehind him, Mina was standing at the stove. She was cooking onions, humming to herself. The smell was twisting my gut.\n\nI screamed, a deep and guttural screech sending my thoughts into a tailspin.\n\nAt the same time though, the knife dropped. But not like it was supposed to. It dropped with purpose, blade first.\n\nPiercing my hand to the table, it didn’t stop, this sentient blade digging deeper and deeper through flesh and bone  until it was perforating me. Pinning me to the table. I screamed again, my cry choking between my clenched teeth. This time I barely made a noise, just a breath.\n\nAnother knife was hanging, almost comically. Before it followed suite, successfully immobilising my body. I was aware of red spurting, pooling across the surface. \n\nBut he wasn’t finished. A third knife hung above me and made a sweeping motion. I watched it come close to my leg, the blade nicking my skin. He was playing with me. I was aware of Charlie hovering by. I could sense the heat of the flame on his fingers, a fire he was playing with. Gabe disappeared for a moment before bending over me. Something was clenched between his teeth. A marker pen. He plucked the lid off, and used the marker, marking my stomach, then my legs and arms. The knives seemed to follow him, eager, like they were ready to get to work. Thankfully, they didn’t.\n\nThe three were going to skin me. Eat me. Their eyes held no life except unbridled greed, a craving I couldn’t understand. Charlie held a plate, and Gabe ran his fingers up and down my legs, squeezing excess skin through his fist.\n\nBefore they could, however, my door was flying open, a swarm of men and women in black filling the room.\n\nI was helped off of the table quickly, the knives being pulled from my hands.\n\nI barely felt the pain.\n\nInstead, I was watching my friends automatically going for the kill. They acted like animals. Whatever these people have turned them into, they’re like monsters. Charlie grabbed a masked man, and snapped his neck, before he was shot down. Mina was slower. She held up her hands in mock surrender. Her gaze scanned the crowd for a victim. But before she could lunge, she too was taken down. \n\nThis time from the back. A man had stabbed her in the back of the neck with a shot. Gabe stumbled back, outnumbered.  He looked like he was going to attack, before the man pulled out a device. To me, it was barely a scratch to my ear. But to Gabe, it was torture. \n\nHis trembling hands went to bloody ears—- mouth opening but no sound coming out. When Gabe dropped to his knees with a snarl, a choked ripping from his lips, I started towards him. I wanted to help him. I mean, despite what they had done to me, I wanted to help him. But rough arms were dragging me violently back.\n\nThe device, whatever it was, must have been cranked to its highest setting, turning Gabe into a quivering mess, burying his head in his knees.\n\n“Calm down.” The man said through the mask.\n\nGabe actually looked human again for a moment, squeezing his eyes shut. If I ignored his eyes, and glistening incisors. “I am calm!” He cried through his teeth. “Turn that off!” His expression crumpled. “Please. I’m begging you. Just please turn that thing off. It’s…it’s killing me!”\n\nThey did, eventually. And just like that, Gabe too was tranquilised like an animal.\n\nI watched my friends get dragged out of my house like wild animals—and thrown into a white van.\n\n“Are you alright, miss?” A woman had bandaged my hand. She smiled reassuringly. “Your friends have some minor food poisoning. We’re just taking them to check them over, alright? There’s nothing to worry about.” \n\nHer tone was almost hypnotising, turning my thoughts foggy.\n\nI nodded dizzily.\n\n“Are you sure you’re okay?”\n\nI was pretty sure I wasn’t. The woman left me with a promise to contact me when my friends were “better” but I wasn’t thinking about her words. I couldn’t get the image out of my head. The look of mania, of unbridles madness in Mina’s eyes as she prepared me to be skinned.\n\nThere were two men standing outside the van, watching guards throw Mina, Gabe, and Charlie into the back.\n\nOne of them was smoking. Through a drag, he slapped the doors. “What have we got here?”\n\n“Potentials.” The other man said.  “Take ‘em’ back to HQ. We’ve got potentials! Why the long face, huh? This is what we wanted.”\n\nThe smoker chuckled before stamping out his cigarette. “Alright, come on. Let’s load em’ up.”\n\nI did probably the stupidest thing I’ve ever done in my life after that.\n\nI jumped in the back with them. I expected just my friends, but there are more people. All of them knocked out. It’s been several hours since the van arrived at its destination. I’ve managed to hide behind a pile of body bags. They took my friends hours ago, and I’m too scared to see where I am. I’ve checked several times through the gap in the door. I’m in a large parking lot. \n\nThis place reminds me of the dentist.\n\nIt’s got that smell, you know? Like… clinical.\n\nIf this phone stays alive, I’ll try and update you.\n\nSomething tells me Hello Fresh’s “mutation” wasn’t an accident.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10016p0/rules_for_visiting_my_house/",
        "text": "Hello there, dear friend. I am very glad that you have decided to come over, and I am greatly anticipating your visit. However, there are a few simple rules that you must follow in order to have a good time and to, in the future, be invited back, if you’re truly up for that again.\n\n1. You are able to visit any day of the year, even holidays, except for the days of the summer, spring, autumn, and winter equinoxes. Those are vastly important days for me and my family, and it would therefore be unwise to reach out to me or contact me at all during this time. For your own sake, it would be best if I didn’t cross your mind at all. \n\n2. You may arrive at anytime in the day or evening, except for the times known as angel numbers, such as 1:11, 2:22, 3:33, 4:44, or 5:55. You will find that my grandfather who lives in the attic, if you are unfortunate enough to meet him, is incredibly superstitious. Sometimes you can even hear him repeating a strange sequence of numbers, and if you do, make sure not to memorize the sequence and try your best to forget that you heard them in the first place.\n\n3. Once you are dropped off, you must walk up to the house on the sidewalk and the sidewalk only. Under no circumstances will your feet touch the grass. Believe me, the effects of the lawn fertilizer have caused inexplicable damage to guests I have had over in the past, and I will refrain from going into further detail, for the sake of your precious sanity.\n\n4. When you reach the door, you must grab the handle held by the gilded lion-shaped holder, and you must knock three times, no more and no less. I will answer immediately. \n\n5. If I happened to be wearing anything red, including clothing, shoes, or even makeup, you must run immediately, without looking back. Also, in the case, make sure to refrain from making eye contact with me at all costs. \n\n6. You will follow me inside, and you will see my father sitting on the brown couch in the living room. If you do not see him, no worries, he’s probably just doing his research or tending to the garden. Or maybe They’ve got him. You never really know, do you? If you do see him, you must wave politely and he will give you a nod. If he winks at you, it’s probably best that he doesn’t see you again.\n\n7. I’m deeply sorry that I didn’t mention this sooner, but if at any point in your visit you feel a growing vibration in the ground or if you notice the fresh cracks in the walls, floors, or ceilings, you must leave IMMEDIATELY, no questions asked.\n\n8. I won’t dictate our options of entertainment too much, but I’m afraid that my home doesn’t offer much. We can play a board game, perhaps, or watch a movie on the TV in my room. If you choose to play a board game, I must retrieve one from the storage room in the basement. NEVER GO IN THE BASEMENT. While I am down there, you must wait at the door and not make a sound. I won’t be long, but as I emerge from the dark basement, do not bother to take a peek at what lies down in the depths. \n\n9. We will go up to my room and hang out there for a while. We can watch any movie you’d like, except for horror movies, for Grandfather has abnormally excellent hearing, and we wouldn’t want to remind him of what They are capable of. \n\n10. As you explore the house, you will notice pictures of a young boy, about 11 years old. That is my brother. Do not ask my parents any questions about him and do not let them catch you staring at the photos. \n\n11. When you enter my room, please close the drapes. The neighbors love to try and take photos, each and every one of them strives to be that brave soul who will discover the dark and complex secrets of what my family is hiding, but none of their guesses will match the truth. Ugh, I’m sorry. I promise that my intentions are not to frighten you. I just want to protect you from falling victim to Them, as Grandfather and my brother once did.\n\n12. Speaking of Grandfather, sometimes he will come down from the attic and walk frantically through the halls, still repeating the same chain of numbers that I have already informed you about. Once again, do not fear Grandfather, he is just recalling his past experiences, and his ways of doing that are beyond ordinary. If you do happen to run into him, do not make eye contact for it will frighten him, and keep on walking. \n\n13. Once it reaches dinner time, my mother will show up at the door to my room and ask you if you’d like to stay for dinner. You must be polite and accept the offer, for my mother is a very generous and kind woman, and will not give you much of a choice.\n\n14. My mother is a wonderful cook, but be sure not to ingest any fruits or vegetables she might serve you. They will appear to be rotting, for the second any fresh produce enters my house, the life is sucked out of it and it is not safe to eat. I encourage you to enjoy anything else she gives you.\n\n15. You may leave any time before midnight. Before you make your way to the door, I will bid you farewell and hand you a red envelope. You will not open in, even in the safety of your own home. You will hold onto it until you see me at school again.\n\n16. As you make your way to the door, you will notice a weird beeping noise coming from the library. That is just our old telegraph. That is how They communicate with us, through Morse code. Please just ignore it and proceed on your way out.\n\n17. When you get home, check to make sure there are no weird marks on your body or vine-like stains on you legs. If this happens to be the case. Then I’m afraid your time is running out. Not to worry you, of course.\n\n18. Lastly, if I am not at school for you to give me the envelope, I’m sorry to tell you that it means one of two things. I have either lost my soul in the depths of the Void just like Grandfather, or I have been engulfed into the Void completely like my brother, and I fear that you will never hear from me again. \n\n19. If this is the case, and I am gone forever, and then you can feel free to open and read what lies within the envelope, but please do so in private, for this is one secret that I cannot share. But if it is not, and I am there to retrieve the envelope from your possession, then you may forever hold your peace in the unknowingness of oblivion.",

        "text": "What I'm about to tell you might be true, or it might just be a truly horrifying nightmare.\n\nThis happened four months ago. For context, I'm 17 and I live with my parents in a small suburban town called Fox Avenue. Population: 3476. Like I said, small town. Everyone knew each other, it was like, the town had no secrets. Sometimes it felt nice to know what everyone's doing. Other times, it was like having a not so secret stalker always watching your every move. Fox Avenue has 3 main places - the town centre, the beach and the forest. Lucky for me, my family and I lived right by the beach. Our house was technically on it. It's warm all year, so a good swim never hurt anybody. There was only one high school and one primary school in our town. I'm now entering 12th grade. Only one more year left in this hellhole. Some people call Fox Ave paradise but that's all bullshit. This town is creppy as hell. Half of the population is over the age of 80 and batshit crazy, so seeing an old granny running around the street naked isn't an uncommon sight. Anyway, back to the story.\n\nThe weekend the incident took place, my parents were out of the state on a business retreat. As they were leaving, my mom handed me some money for pizza and told me I could have Avery over for a sleepover. I was ectatic. Avery had been my best friend since we were both around 4 years old, so my mom letting me invite her over while we were alone for the night, was even better than I imagined. I called her over right as my parents drove out of the driveway. Since we were practically neighbors it didn't take her long to come knocking at my door. We hung out, drank some wine we found in my dads cabinet (whoops), ate pizza and watched corny rom-coms. At some point, we completely zoned out (wonder what got that kicked in), so she decided to run down to the kitchen and get us some aspirin. I agreed and she lazily got out of the bed. I waited for her while watching another corny rom-com. I waited some more. And some more. What the fuck was taking her so long? I decided to go check up on her. Shit, what if she fell down the stairs or something? No way, I would've heard that. When I was walking down the stairs, I swore I heard two people talking. I thought it was just my drunk mind, so I continued walking. When I got to the kitchen, I froze. Avery was chatting with a woman. The woman was wearing an oversized hoodie and black biker shorts, shark slippers and had her brown long hair up in a messy bun. I've never seen that woman in my life. Avery noticed me staring.\n\n\"Uhh, Tina? You okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Who the fuck is that?\" I asked, basically spitting the words out of my mouth.\n\n\"Are you that drunk that you don't even recognize your sister?\"\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nMy sister?\n\nSister?\n\n**I'm an only child.**\n\n\"What are you talking about? Avery, I've been an only child my whole life, you know that!\" I argued, on the verge of a panic attack.\n\n\"Haha, really funny, Avery. Did you two drink the wine out of dads cabinet?\" the woman asked. It was the first time I've heard her speak. Her voice sounded identical to mine. And then I took a good look at her face and body. Fuck. She looks exactly like me. She sounds, looks and acts the same way that I do. Wait. I remembered something I read online not too long ago. Doppelgängers. They're basically you from another dimension, or whatever, and they come to our world and try to replace us. Shit. I ran to Avery, grabbed her and ran to my bedroom. I almost broke my ankle running up the stairs. When we got to my room, I slammed the door and locked it. I sat down on the bed and started hyperventilating. Avery was on the floor, gasping for air.\n\n\"What th-\" she stopped mid sentence. \"Are you okay? Tina, what happened? How did I get here?\"\n\n\"What do you mean how did you get here?! I just saved you from that.. that thing!\" I screamed at her.\n\n\"Tina, what thing? What are you talking about?\" she asked, frantically.\n\n\"Do you seriously not remember? You went down to get some aspirin for us and then saw my 'sister'.\"\n\n\"Aren't you an only child? What sister, Tina?\"\n\nOh my god. She doesn't remember. How does she not remember?\n\nThere was a knock at the door. Oh shit. \n\n\"Who the fuck is that? Tina?\" Avery whispered.\n\n\"It's her.\"\n\nThe door knob started rattling. Avery screamed and ran to me. Just as she dove on the bed, the creaky door opened. Slowly, I stood up. Avery begged me not to go but I knew I had to. I walked over to the door and stuck my head out. I looked left, right and saw...\n\nNothing. Absoluetly nothing. I sighed a sigh of relief and looked back at Tina.\n\nShe was gone.\n\nI froze. Where could she have gone? My room was small with no space to hide, except for under my bed. I crept down and looked under it.\n\nAnd saw myself staring back at me, smiling wildly.",

        "text": " I'm a father of twins, and ever since they were born, one of them always felt somehow different. I never acted on this feeling, I mean who would believe me if I said I felt like one son wasn't mine? Was that even possible?\n\nAll my life I've played favorites with my son's for that sole reason. We named them Josh and Luke. Josh was my son, the son I loved. I tried to love Luke, I really did, but it was just so hard, he was, and still is such a weird kid, always going out of his way to cause trouble. My wife disagrees with me and because of that we have gotten into numerous fights. She thinks I should love both of them equally despite their differences, which is ironic. Shouldn't twins be the same? And I always argue that I can't love them the same because they aren't, despite them being twins.\n\nWe still live together, but it has gotten to the point that there's no longer any spark between us two. The only reason we even still live together is for our kids, or in my case for Josh. I don't want him to grow up without a mother, or father.\n\nThe twins both turned 16 this november. Luke has been absolutely horrible. He's been acting out any and every way he can since his 16th birthday. And thats because I got Josh a brand new car, and Luke a bike. I guess that was a little unfair, but Josh really did deserve it. The entire year of 2022 he's been so respectful, so helpful around the house, doing chores, helping me out in the garage. He's even taken an interest into mechanic's profession, just like his dad. Meanwhile Luke was the complete opposite. Taking interest in music, in piano. Disguisting.\n\nHe asked his mom to enroll him into music school, and get him a piano. I said no. He screamed and shouted, which didn't help his case. Eventually he calmed down and went to his room. I never agreed to any music school, or a piano. But I know that his mother takes him to those classes every wednesday and saturday. Josh told me.\n\nDecember was my breaking point with Luke. Josh came into the garrage late one night crying, which was very rare to see Josh do, he was a very tough kid. I asked him what's wrong, and then he told me, or better yet showed me. Luke had stolen Josh's car keys, and because of his stupidity, completely totaled it. I calmed Josh down, told him to man up and that we'd fix the car.\n\nI went into Luke's room. He was studying, which I'd give him credit for, if it wasn't fucking music. That made me even angrier. His mom wasn't home. I was never a violent father, I still am not, but something just snapped in me. I grabbed him by his collar and threw him onto his bed. I screamed at him, shouted. Pointed fingers. \"Why can't you just be normal like Josh? Why do you have to ruin our lives?\" He was crying. He was talking back, he was good at that, talking back. I walked over to his desk, started mocking his interest in music. I picked up the sheets of music on the desk, and tore them into a million pieces. He screamed at me that he hates me. He ran out of his room. That's when I noticed Josh, peeking into Luke's room, he had the widest grin on his face.\n\nI wasn't proud of the way I handled the situation. I let my emotions get the better of me. So it wasn't surprising that my wife got me a folder for christmas. The folder had our divorce papers in them. She took Luke and left the house without saying another word. We've been texting back and forth, her asking me if I signed the papers yet, and me saying that I will not. I want her to stay for atleast another two years, until Josh moves out for college, then it doesn't matter anymore.\n\nWe repaired Josh's car. It was left abandoned in a ditch beside one of the dirt roads leading out of town. Which was weird, Luke would have no reason to go out of town, meanwhile all of Josh's friends lived outside of it. When I asked Josh about it, he broke down crying. He said he lied that Luke stole it because he was scared that I'd beat him. I was a little upset at that, how could Josh think that I'd beat him? I told him that it was okay, and to man up and stop crying. But also warned him to never lie to me again. He said he loved me, which warmed my heart.\n\nMy wife and I decided to try and spend new years together, our kids included too. I had to promise I'd apologise to Luke, which I'm finding a difficult task, because I'm just full of pride like that. I hate to admit when I'm wrong, but it must be done.\n\nWhen they arrived at the house, me and Josh had already prepared a delicious dinner. Once Luke came into the house, I hugged him reluctantly, and told him that I'm sorry. He held me tight, which was uncomfortable, but I let him. He told me he forgives me. My wife was happy to see that, but then she motioned to Josh. We never agreed that Josh should apologise, and we broke into another argument. Eventually Luke said its fine, and that we should just eat. So we did.\n\nMy wife had some news for us, for me. I was excited, I thought they were moving back in, my wife was moving back in. But instead my wife told me that she got a call from the hospital the other day. When I asked what it was about, she said that once our twins were born, one of them was accidentally switched with a different child. My blood turned cold, so thats why Luke was always so weird. I nodded, giving myself an imaginary high five for being right all along.\n\nThen Luke spoke up, he said he also had some news. I rolled my eyes, but maybe this was good, maybe he'd say that he's finally giving up on music. But no, what came out of his mouth made me want to hate him even more, kill him even. \"Dad, I'm gay.\" Is what he said. I couldn't believe my ears. \"What in the fuck is wrong with you?\" I said out loud. Josh laughed at that. I gave him a look to shut up.\n\nLuke looked at his feet, my wife's eyes were bulging with surprise, both at me, and at Luke. \"Luke I thought we talked about this.\" My wife said trying to console him. \"You knew!?\" I spat out at her. \"That's it, we're leaving.\" She said. \"You're not going anywhere.\" I replied, rushing to the front door to block the path. Luke was trembling, but I didn't care. I could see Josh grinning in the background, still eating his chicken.\n\n\"Kill him dad!\" He encouraged. Maybe I will. \"He's your son!\" My wife screamed at me. \"No he isn't! You just told me he's been switched!\" I shouted back, pointing fingers. She shook her head. \"It's not Luke that's been switched.\" She said calmly. \"Shut up!\" I screamed at her, lunging at Luke, I pushed him to the ground and began strangling him. My wife tried to get me off him. I pushed her away. \"Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!\" Josh yelled with excitement. I could see the light leave Luke's eyes, and then he stopped strugling. I let go.\n\n\"Luke?! Luke!\" My wife screamed, going to his side. I sat back down at the dinner table, continuing to eat. \"Good job dad.\" Josh said. I looked at him. Really looked at him. He was grinning. His eyes were hazel, mine were blue and my wife's brown. He had curly blonde hair. My and my wife's hair were always brown. Josh's nose was pointy, mine was fleshy, and my wife's was buttoned. The more I compared our features to his, the less everything fit together. Josh looked nothing like us.\n\nWe had actually noticed them looking different a couple weeks after birth, our doctor assured it was normal, and that twins don't always look identical. \"You're a monster!\" My wife screamed at me as she held up Luke's limp arm over her shoulder and began walking out.\n\n\"You're letting them go?\" Josh questioned curiously.\n\n\"What have I done?\" I said under my breath.\n\nJosh grinned even [wider.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coureherritt)",

        "text": "I've never been superstitious, but I have heard that dogs can sense spirits. I've never even thought about it, until recently I woke up to the sound of my dog, Bella, barking frantically. It was a sound I was all too familiar with, but this time it was different. There was an urgency to her barking that I had never heard before. I sat up in bed, rubbing my eyes, and listened as she barked and growled, her claws scratching at the bedroom door. I got out of bed and made my way to the door, trying to calm her down. But as soon as I touched the doorknob, she stopped barking and went silent. I hesitated, wondering if I should open the door or just go back to bed, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, so I slowly turned the doorknob and opened the door.\n\nBella was standing in the doorway, her hackles raised and her body tense. She was snarling and barking as if something was behind me, her teeth bared and her eyes fixed on a spot just over my shoulder. It makes my hair stand up and I get chills just thinking about it. I turned to look, but there was nothing there.\n\nI tried to calm her down, but she was having none of it. She continued to bark and growl, her body shaking with fear. I had never seen her like this before, and it was starting to seriously scare me. I didn't know what was wrong, but I knew I had to do something.\n\nI decided to turn on the lights. As soon as I did, Bella stopped barking and went back to her usual self, wagging her tail and licking my hand. I couldn't help but wonder if it was all in her head, or if there was really something there.\n\nI tried to put it out of my mind and go back to bed, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Bella's panicked face, her teeth bared and her body shaking with fear.\n\nThe next night, it happened again. I woke up to the sound of Bella barking and growling, and this time I could feel her trying to push me out of bed. I sat up and saw her standing in bed at my feet, her body rigid and her eyes fixed on something behind me.\n\nI turned to look, but there was nothing there. Bella was still barking and growling, her body shaking uncontrollably. I tried to calm her down, but she refused. I knew I had to do something, so I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight.As soon as the light hit the wall behind my bed, Bella stopped barking and went back to her normal self. I couldn't see anything out of the ordinary, but I knew that something was there. I didn't know what it was, but I knew that it was dangerous.\n\nI don't know what's going on with Bella, but I'm starting to get scared. I don't know if she's just imagining things, or if there's really something there, but I can't shake the feeling that something sinister is at work here. I don't know what to do, but I'm starting to feel like I'm not alone in this house anymore.",

        "text": "It was a typical Wednesday night when I logged onto Reddit, looking for some entertainment before bed. I had always been a fan of the horror subreddit, and tonight was no different. I was scrolling through the posts, laughing at the memes and creepy stories, when I came across a post by a user called \"SatanWorship\".\n\nThe post was simply a link to a video of a woman singing, but as soon as I heard her voice, I was hooked. It was unlike anything I had ever heard before - a mixture of beauty and madness that sent shivers down my spine. I couldn't stop listening, and I barely noticed as the minutes turned into hours.\n\nEventually, I tore myself away from the video and checked the comments. There were hundreds of replies from other users, all of them raving about the singer. And then, I saw a reply from SatanWorship.\n\n\"Hello, my love,\" the message read. \"I saw that you were enjoying my song, and I wanted to thank you. My name is Stacy, I have been searching for someone like you for a long time, someone who can appreciate the beauty of my voice and the power of my madness. Do you want to meet me in person?\"\n\nI was both intrigued and terrified by the message. On one hand, I was flattered that a woman as beautiful and talented as Stacy would be interested in me. On the other hand, I had a feeling that meeting her in person would be a very bad idea.\n\nBut I couldn't resist the lure of Stacy's voice, and I found myself responding to her message. We talked online for hours, and the more I talked to her, the more I realized that she was completely insane. She ranted about sacrificing people to the devil and drinking their blood, and she seemed to have a particular fascination with me.\n\nI tried to back out of the conversation, but Stacy was relentless. She kept messaging me, pleading with me to meet her in person. And eventually, I caved.\n\nWe made plans to meet at the old abandoned church on the outskirts of town. I knew it was a risky move, but I couldn't resist the pull of Stacy's voice. And so, on a dark and stormy night, I found myself standing outside the church, waiting for Stacy to arrive.\n\nShe showed up a few minutes later, dressed in all black and wearing a wicked grin. \"Hello, my love,\" she said, taking my hand and leading me inside. \"I have been waiting for this moment for a long time.\"\n\nThe inside of the church was even more decrepit than the outside, with cobwebs covering the walls and the floorboards creaking under our feet. But I barely noticed as Stacy led me to the altar and sat me down.\n\n\"I have a special ceremony planned for tonight, my love,\" she said, pulling out a knife and a chalice. \"We are going to sacrifice you to the devil and drink your blood. And then, you will be mine forever.\"\n\nI tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move. I was hit over the head with something and I fell to the ground,  Stacy's voice was still playing in my head, and I was powerless to resist it. When I awoke I was already on a sacrificial table, I closed my eyes, waiting for the end.\n\nBut the end never came. Instead, I heard a commotion behind me, and then, I felt a hand on my shoulder. \"Don't worry, I've got you,\" a voice said.\n\nI opened my eyes to see a group of people standing over me, including a police officer and a couple of EMTs. They were talking to Stacy, who was screaming and ranting about sacrificing me to the devil.\n\nI tried to speak, but my voice was barely a whisper. One of the EMTs crouched down next to me and smiled. \"Don't worry, you're safe now,\" he said. \"We got a call about a disturbance at the church, and when we arrived, we found you unconscious on the altar. It looks like you were drugged.\"\n\nI nodded, still too stunned to speak. The EMT helped me to my feet and led me outside, where an ambulance was waiting. I climbed inside and collapsed onto the gurney, still trying to process what had happened.\n\nAs the ambulance drove away, I turned to the EMT and whispered, \"Thank you.\"\n\nHe smiled and patted my hand. \"It's my job,\" he said. \"But I have a feeling you're going to be okay.\"\n\nI spent the next few days in the hospital, recovering from the effects of the drugs and the trauma of my encounter with Stacy. The police arrested her and charged her with attempted murder, and I was relieved to know that she would never be able to hurt anyone else again.\n\nAs I lay in my hospital bed, I couldn't help but wonder how I had gotten mixed up with a deranged psychopath like Stacy. I had always been careful about who I talked to online, but I had been drawn in by her voice and her charms. I vowed to be more careful in the future, and to trust my instincts when it came to strangers.\n\nI was released from the hospital a few days later, and I returned home with a newfound appreciation for life. I may always carry the memory of Stacy's voice and her madness with me, but I know that I am stronger for having survived her. And I am grateful to the people who saved me, for showing me that there is still good in the world.",

        "text": "*Ellie, come in, Ellie?*  A voice crackled to life from my desk, and I realized I'd completely tuned out an entire Zoom meeting. I'd been distracted, and forgot what I was presenting to my team. I had screen share on, and it was open to a blank word document. The clock read 1:11. Had the meeting just barely started, or run over? I couldn't remember. I shook my head, gave a quick excuse, and dismissed my team before slamming shut my laptop. Something had started bugging me, and it took me a moment to realize it-- *it smelled like roses.*\n\nA few months ago, I decided I was ready to date again. I'd gotten divorced about a year before COVID hit, and by the time I was ready to open myself up to the horror of dating in your 30s, suddenly we were all on lockdown, and I had zero hope of meeting someone in the conventional manner. \n\nI've never been big on online dating, but working from home, the only person I was seeing in the flesh was my therapist, once a week. I was desperate for some sort of human interaction that wasn't work related. Enter Shawn.\n\nHe wasn't the kind of guy I normally would swipe right on. His profile was pretty generic, spoke little of his interests, and had just the bare details filled out. He had some sort of obscure literary quote from an old classic, but the fact that he didn't want kids stood out to me. Swiping through his pictures, I came across one taken at a bar in NOLA, with his shirt pulled up, a goofy grin, and an offering of plastic, multi-colored beads. I swiped right, and then found myself distracted by work. My phone lay forgotten on my desk for the next hour.\n\nThen, a notification. A second. A third. I realized Shawn had swiped right as well, and was messaging me. He asked me about my tattoos and my cat, and easily lured me out of my work for the rest of the Friday afternoon. Before I knew it, we'd been texting until midnight. Then, he called. Before I knew it, I was agreeing at 2 AM to let a stranger come over to my apartment. He'd insisted it wasn't to be *like that,*  but that after a day of happy conversation, he just wanted to be near me. To kiss me. And again, I was starved for affection. Looking back, even knowing what I know now, I can't say I blame myself.\n\nTrue to his word, his affections remained at kissing. We stayed up talking until sunrise, and fell asleep together in the pale morning light streaming through the dusty blinds on my window. \n\nWhen I woke up at noon, I was pleasantly surprised that he was still there. So much so, that I made him pancakes. He didn't stay long after, he was going to check in with his mom. When he left, I caught a scent of roses on the wind. I fell asleep that night smiling.\n\nWeeks turned into months, and our relationship was...mostly normal. At least for the first few weeks. You know how they say that everyone wears a mask for the first little while of a new relationship, and then lets out little bits of their \"normal\" at a time? Well...Shawn's normal was...*different.* \n\nHe shunned social media. Increasingly normal for our generation, now that we've seen some of the lasting effects it's had. But he wouldn't even let anyone take his pictures. I became surprised that he'd managed to find any pictures of himself for the dating site. Even when I tried to sneak snap a photo to my friends, I somehow always managed to miss him, leaving me with only pictures of our background. \n\nOn top of that, he told me none of his friends knew about me. He said none of them would believe he was making it with a real girl. I laughed it off, but he said that truly, none of his friends would believe I was real. I know that guys can be harsh with each other, but I tried to brush it off. We'd only been dating a few months, I definitely wasn't expecting to integrate friend groups yet. But it was little things like that, things that were just on the cusp of being easily explainable, that gave me this lingering feeling of unease. \n\nFridays became our day. He'd come over after work, we'd have dinner, it was pretty normal. Last Friday, though, things felt different. When he came over, he seemed a little preoccupied. I tried to pretend more convincingly that I was into the weird YouTube videos he always wanted me to watch with him- weird, AI generated people whose skin stretched too far over their disproportioned faces, singing nonsensical songs. He was obsessed with videos like these. I thought, if I showed some enthusiasm, it might perk him up a bit. Finally, he told me he'd run into an ex--or at least, he'd seen her while he was out. He said they didn't talk at all, but it had obviously unnerved him.\n\nHe told me that it had been about a year since their breakup, and seeing her freaked him out because he realized how similar she and I were. He pulled up a picture, and he was right- we could have been sisters. She even had a heart tattoo in the same place I had mine- midway up the left forearm. \n\nThat night, I pulled out all the stops in bed, determined to make him forget about her, but my heart wasn't in it. Her face pulled to the front of my thoughts, too. I'd never considered myself jealous, but we were so alike, I had to wonder if that was the only reason he was seeing me. Regardless, my plan worked, and he slept harder than he'd ever slept at my place. He left early the next morning, and this time, the scent of roses lingered in my sheets, my closet. Pushing away thoughts of his ex-girlfriend, I pulled up Twitter to doomscroll. \n\nI realized I had a message request. It had come in last night, some time while I was making Shawn forget his own name. It was a dark picture. I could tell something was there, but it was barely visible. The username was a random string of letters and numbers I tweeted it out to my followers, asking one of them to work some photoshop magic and reveal themselves if it was a prank. One of them privately DM'd me back, asking if this was some sort of joke. Confused, I asked what they meant. They sent the attachment back, lightened. It was a picture of me, two nights prior, sleeping. I knew the date because I was wearing my new sleep mask. Scrawled on notebook paper, below my sleeping face, two words in blocky handwriting.\n\n*Save her.*",

        "text": "  \n\nThe eastern seaboard is beautiful. \n\nFrom the northern to the southern coast, there is no shortage of rocky shorelines, sandy beaches and marinas. However, most don’t give thought to the lighthouses that enthrall children with their sheer size and serve as beautifully scenic backdrops for proposal photos and whatnot. \n\nI grew up here, ever so familiar with the scenery in question. The fantastical sunsets comprised of hues you’ll only ever see over the sea. This coastal town of mine, this small tourist attraction of seafood shops and fresh fish markets, has always been somewhere I never felt the desire to leave. Honestly, not until recently, when I noticed something odd going around the lighthouse on the very peninsula of my town. \n\nHaunting, beautiful or historical marvels, call them what you will; however, I will never be able to bear witness to a lighthouse in the same light again. I guess I’ll start at the beginning of all the weirdness.\n\nTwo weeks ago, coming off the boat for the day, the crew and I noticed several vehicles with out of state plates driving through the market area, which was the only way to get to the lighthouse. The massive structure was built sometime in the mid-1850s, and still stands stoic and very functional to this day. It lingered about 20 minutes truly outside of the town, down a very narrow and often wet road. The shape of the coastline and the massive rocks that comprised its walls made for very treacherous tides and waves. \n\nI couldn’t say for sure if they were tourists or not, though it’s not exactly tourist season right now. Something about the way the vehicles moved just jumped out to me. It was too uniform and too confident for the speed they were driving through such a pedestrian heavy area. As if consequences did not exist for them.\n\nI looked toward the lighthouse and stared a moment, waiting for the light to make its way full circle a few times before turning my attention back to the vehicles. I watched as they continued their journey confidently towards the lighthouse and wondered about the man who worked there. Everyone knew him as Ernie.\n\nHe arrived a little over a decade ago to assume the caretaker role of the lighthouse. After the old man before him retired, someone who was qualified properly had to be brought in from out of town to take over. He wasn’t from here, but he was certainly from the east coast, just a bit more inland I believe.\n\nEveryone was fine for the first few days. Those vehicles were still stationed up at the lighthouse. I had mostly forgotten about it. I had just assumed that they were possibly scientists or some type of class or study group or something. They weren’t bothering anyone. I want to say maybe even the first whole week went by without issue.\n\nIt was a little after 1AM Friday morning, when I was woken up by a light so brought that it flooded my room, hell it flooded everything with such intensity that it was hard to keep my eyes open at all. \n\n*What the fuck?* A whir of thoughts slammed through my mind, all possibilities all at once in my still slightly tired stupor. An explosion, some type of asteroid or invasion. Hell, even aliens. I slid out of bed quickly and made my way to the window, hoping to see something through the light that seemed to be only growing brighter and brighter. I swear it started to make skin tingle, or itch or something. Almost like when you drink pre-workout.\n\nI made my way out to the hallway, which wasn’t as bright due to its lack of anyway windows at all, but it still appeared bright thanks to the whiteness making its way through the cracks of other doorways and even up the stairs. I almost fell down the stairs trying to see my way down and burst out the front door just in time for the light to start receding, until it returned to normal and started rotating again. \n\nIt was the lighthouse’s light? What? \n\nI could see other lights on in the neighborhood, but I guess I was the only one brave, or foolish enough to rush outside, so I went back inside and started typing this up. I’m going to try and get a little more sleep after I upload this, but my pounding heart and sore eyes might make that a bit difficult. Anyone have any idea what could have caused that? I have never witnessed anything quite like that in my life. Only in those old videos of atomic bomb testing and shit like that.\n\nThe next morning on my way to the supermarket, I spent most of the ride deep in thought and rubbing my eyes, replaying the previous night’s events in my mind. The more I focused on my memory of the light, the stronger that skin tingling sensation would creep its way back up my arms. However, as I reached my destination and pulled into small parking lot, I happened to catch the end of a news broadcast where they seemed to be talking about it!\n\n“Local authorities reported a massive influx of phone calls early this morning in regard to what appears to be the testing of a new, more efficient type of bulb for lighthouses and FAA lighting across the nation.” The newscaster sounded young, but I couldn’t help but notice how out of place their voice sounded on the radio, if that makes any sense. \n\n“An interview early this morning with a local lighthouse keeper may shed some light on what may have occurred.” They continued. How early are these reporters interviewing people on weekends? It was just before 8AM. “According to the man we spoke to, the lighthouses are simply old enough that any new technology introduced to the structure also has to be accompanied by the proper retrofitting.”\n\nI shrugged to myself and turned the car off, making my way up to the entrance of the market only to be greeted by several other shoppers and a locked door.\n\n“The girl who usually opens the store today hasn’t come in, yet I guess nobody can get a hold of her. I believe the owners are on their way now to get the day going.” An elderly woman approached me as I walked up.\n\nI felt a sense of dread wash over me for some reason, and I couldn’t help but let my mind wander back that damn light. I turned towards the lighthouse, my gaze finding its way to the light. I could see the housing swirling its way around the glass at the top from where I was standing. Everything looked normal; however, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong or out of place.\n\nTo be honest I don’t really know how to explain what I meant, but as my eyes were wandering around the lighthouse property, eventually they settled on those cars. They were still there. It didn’t sit right with me for some reason.\n\nAnyway, the rest of the day and even the weekend carried on without anymore issues, though I’m not sure if that girl from the market had turned up yet. I had somewhat let the thought of her slip my mind. Come to think of it, I let a lot slip from my mind until the time of typing this. Nothing else happened with the lighthouse, though.\n\nThe more I think about all of this, the more my head starts to hurt. It’s borderline throbbing after writing this all up, so I’m going to go rest for a while.\n\nI will update you all if anything else occurs!",

        "text": "Hello, and welcome all. To my shock and still disbelief, we have lived long enough for us to make a part two. Our situation ended with me running Mr Morbid off the road. Now, we’ve been driving for a while and we haven’t seen a sign of him. \n\nHowever, we did have to pull over and take a head count. Me, Emma, Skylar, Giovanni, Tyler, and Michael. We also double checked that the walkies we all had were working. During this time, I read the rules for the van. The rules are as follows:\n\nRule One: If you see Mr Morbid on the side of the road, RUN HIM OVER. Should you miss or notice him too late, refer to rule 3a\n\nRule two: If you hear the radio cutting on and off, turn it off and pop open the engine. Kill whatever is in the engine space.\n\nRule 3: If you see a dark hooded man with a sign, pull over and ask him for directions to Earth. If he says Up, pull out as fast as you can. If you see him again, run him over. If he says down, shoot him in the face. \n\n3a: Should you fail to do this in time, hit the gas and drive as fast and as far as you can. Ignore the figures running next to you. And NEVER answer the shadow figure that will appear in the empty seat. Do your best to ignore him.\n\n4: Never sit in the seat with the blood stains on it. That belongs to Carcass, who is the shadow figured mentioned in rule 3a.\n\n5: If at any point you hear tapping coming from inside the van, stop the van and open the spare tire compartment. If there’s a creature in there, kill it. If there’s a severed hand, RUN back to the drivers seat and FLOOR IT. It has escaped.\n\n6: Once you reach the way back, a rift of light should be visible and the van radio should repeat whatever sentence it had previously been on. If the rift is black but the radio repeats, go around it. If the rift is light but the radio cuts out, DRIVE THE OTHER DIRECTION. \n\n7: If the road starts to turn blood red, then turn around and floor it. If it’s still red within 10 minutes, do not get out of the van for ANY reason. Even if you hear screaming or voices of loved ones, DO NOT.\n\n8: DO NOT STOP AT ANY RESTAURANTS OR GAS STATIONS. Markets are the only safe place.\n\n9: If one of the passengers start talking in the third person, shoot them and dump their body on the side of the road. The real one should appear in a little while.\n\n\nIf these rules didn’t already prove to be real, I would have thrown them out the window myself. But as we were driving and everyone was taking the time to set in our new situation, Gio asked:\n\n“Hey, who’s that guy smiling on the road ahead?”\n\nI looked, and to my dismay, Mr Morbid stood tall with his menacing grin, staring at the van. I immediately turned lanes and ran him over with all the force I could. He flew into a pile of bushes a solid 50 meters away. I drove  away fast and without missing a beat, Michael said:\n\n“WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! You ran over someone!”\n\n“It was Mr Morbid. The rules said to if I see him at any point.”\n\n“Oh shit, the dude from Code Red?” Skylar said.\n\n“Yes. I Saw his jackass outside in the trees out back before we left.”\n\n“Oh, damn. They always said to evacuate but never why. He dangerous or something?” Said Emma\n\n“Genuinely, what do you think? You work a job where your manager is provided a gun with infinite ammo for shooting monsters. Our cash registers are SENTIENT.” \n\nNow, she stared snickering as she took it in. The air started to lift as the gravity of the situation has already set in, since we were making jokes about our impending doom. \n\nWe drove for at least another two hours before the radio started cutting out. I pulled over the van and prepared the hand gun. I popped open the front and a curled up lanky shadow was tinkering with the engine in a fetal position. I grabbed it and threw it out of the engine. It hissed and revealed the most terrifying eyes I have ever seen on a being.\n\nThey were almost placid, but I could FEEL all the anguish and terror behind those vomit yellow eyes. It made me step back in pure fear. It lunges to me, and I shot it in the soldier. It shrieked, and I shot it again in the stomach. It tripped on the road side and fell. It disappeared into the air, as it floated away into ashes. \n\nI hurriedly ran to the van and drove off.\n\n“WHAT WAS THAT?!” Said Gio.\n\nWithout saying a word, I threw the rules manual into the back. \n\n“Read it.”\n\nAfter about two minutes, he said:\n\n“Great, because more damn rules are what we need to survive.” \n\n“Yeah, we kind of do, dumbass. I just shot a shadow creature that struck terror into me with its eyes. Would you have preferred it sabotaged the engine?” \n\n“I… fair.” \n\n“But I get what you’re saying. The bright side is, if the world isn’t on fire when we get back, We get a HUGE government payout.” I said.\n\n“Wait, really?! I can live a comfortable life WITHOUT risking my life slinging burgers?!” Tyler said enthusiastically. \n\n“Maybe. I’ve only heard about it.”\n\n“Still, I’ll hold you to that.”\n\n“I’d expect no less.”\n\nAnother hour passes by, and I eventually see a market. It’s relatively medium sized and has stalled filled to the brim with food. A large red and white sign above it says market. We get out and enter, but it’s been abandoned. Only the products remain. The people seem to have never been here at all.\n\n“Sweet, free food!” Emma says, excited.\n\n“Is it safe to eat?” Asks Skylar.\n\n“The rules seemed to have said so.”\n\n“Okay, I’m not taking that chance.” She said\n\nI walk around for a little while longer and grab some fruit and snacks, seeing as we have no heat to actually make anything. But as I walk towards a stall with chocolates and desserts, I noticed a figure standing by the entrance. A tall, lanky figure, who was smiling a deeply unnatural smile, which curved into his cheeks like it was breaking his jaw. Mr Morbid had returned.\n\nBut this time, he wore a black and white gentlemen’s suit with a brimmed bowlers hat, yet his eyes were still covered by some sort of shadow that was not coming from the bowlers cap. I ducked into the produce building and spoke into the walkie on my shoulder.\n\n“Hide. Mr Morbid is guarding the entrance.”\n\nI’ve been hiding behind a register counter for the past couple of hours. It only now occurred to me that I should update you all. I can hear his sickly and vile voice calling out to us. God only knows what will happen to us. Please, wish us luck. And I’ll hopefully see you all in another update.\n\n[P1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zxwa06/im_a_manager_at_a_cursed_restaurant_i_cant_keep/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

        "text": "My therapist told me that talking this out would help process the trauma, but the local PD and DA’s office warned that revealing too much could damage the investigation. \n\nNeither one matters: I know the police will never figure out what happened, and I’m never going to heal. The only option is mitigating my pain, so let’s get into it.\n\n\n------------\n\nThe headache woke me, and no wonder: I’d passed out sitting up with my head cocked backward, and the position left me feeling like a rail spike had passed cleanly through my left temple before popping out the right one. \n\nI was sitting in a circle with four other people. One was this guy Jerry from my office; the other three I didn’t recognize. I tried to speak, but there was no saliva on my sticky tongue. My arms felt free until I tried to stand; a sharp pain yanked against both hands, and I fell back into my seat. I looked down to see at least a dozen strands of twine wrapped so tightly around each wrist that my fingertips were turning purple. The slack was loose enough to reach in front of me, but stopped just short of allowing my hands to touch each other in hopes of escape. I relaxed against the metal chair, panting. \n\nThat’s when I looked closer at my surroundings. \n\nJerry was struggling with his own twine bonds, meeting the same success that I had. Next to him, a short, college-aged girl was on the edge of hyperventilation. She sat beside a man in a black suit with slicked-back hair. He was grinding his teeth and staring at each of us in turn. Directly across from me was a blonde woman in her fifties. She was gazing at me as though I was the sole reason that every one of her childhood ambitions had turned to shit. \n\n“Ho!”\n\nWe all looked around to see a large, fat man walk to the center of our little circle.\n\n“Ho, ho!” he continued, coming to a halt just before me. Up close, it became apparent that he was trying to put on the guise of Santa Claus. His long, scraggly beard was streaked with gray and white, but was far too greasy to be fluffy. The oversized coat had clearly been red at one point. But it was now so thoroughly streaked with stains that I could only assume were chewing tobacco and squirrel blood that it was mostly brown with crimson patches. His pants reeked of urine that evaporated without being washed, keeping all of the mustiness without losing any of the nastiness. His boots smell of something other than dog shit, because dog shit was altogether more familiar and more pleasant. The cherry on top was a soft Santa cap that had been starched vertically into a cone shape, culminating in a festive fuzzy white ball that clashed with his brown and yellow teeth.\n\n“What are you going to do to us?” Jerry asked, his voice trembling.\n\n“Don’t play into it,” the blonde woman deadpanned. “He wants a reaction. The only control we have is just how bad this is going to be, so let’s not make it worse than the hell we’re about to eat.”\n\nShe delivered the explanation so plainly that I had no doubt every word was correct. \n\n“Would you like to be the first to draw a gift?” Dirty Santa asked. Several tense second passed before I realized that he was talking to me. \n\nI snapped my attention to the center of our unholy ring, where I noticed for the first time that five presents were gift-wrapped and sitting on a small table. \n\n“No,” I squeaked. \n\n“You can unwrap yours and take a look before showing your new friends!” he continued as though I hadn’t spoken. “Keep the toy if you like it, or switch with a neighbor’s if you’re jealous! If someone gives you what they dislike, you have to play with it right away!” \n\nI finally realized what his voice sounded like. My grandmother lived on a farm, and a chicken had once found its way into the kitchen and slipped its foot into the sink. In an attempt to escape, he fluttered his wings and flipped the switch to start the garbage grinder. The sound had rattled me so badly that years later, my pubescent hair grew in already raised. Dirty Santa’s voice caressed the same ungodly recesses of my reluctant brain as that tortured chicken had.\n\nI made a quick judgment call: choosing a gift seemed the best way to keep this psychopath calm, so I reached for a red bag with a green bow. The twine kept me from leaning all the way forward; Dirty Santa responded by reaching down to slide it closer to my fingertips. The smell got exponentially worse as he moved nearer – even while closing my mouth and breathing out through my nostrils – because the scent wafted through my ears and seeped into my sinuses. \n\nPinching the bag with my fingertips, I tipped it over in my lap. Something heavy tumbled out. \n\nIt was a pair of handheld garden shears. \n\nAttached to it was a note that I instinctively read aloud: “For one of your own fingers. Nineteen toes and fingies is enough to type, but can you stay conscious with only thirteen?”\n\nDirty Santa clapped as light and fast as a hummingbird as the young woman started crying, emitting a soft wail of profound hopelessness.\n\n“Oh shit,” Jerry huffed, his breaths coming in short gasps. “Oh shit. This is for real. This is fucking real.”\n\nI stared at the tool in my lap, unwilling to believe what I knew was about to happen. \n\nThe blonde woman was right:\n\nThere are many degrees of “terrible.”\n\nIn hindsight, I can obviously type with a missing finger. I wish that was the worst of it. Of course, things were about to get much more painful than the garden shears, but I’ve reached my limit for today. The valium’s kicking in, and that’s the only way I can sleep at this point. I’ll share more later if I can, but this process is extremely painful for me.\n\n[FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": "\n\nIt all started about a month ago. I began to hear a knock at my door every day around the same time, at exactly 3:00 PM. At first, I thought it was just someone trying to sell something or maybe a mistake. But the knocks continued, every single day, without fail.\n\nI tried to ignore it and carry on with my daily routine, but the knocking was persistent and it started to unsettle me. I couldn't concentrate on my work or my hobbies, and I found myself constantly looking at the clock, waiting for the knock to come.\n\nOne day, I finally decided to confront the person at the door. I opened it and found a man standing there, staring at me with an intense and unsettling gaze. He was tall and thin, with pale skin and dark, sunken eyes. He didn't say anything, he just stood there, staring at me in silence.\n\nI asked him what he wanted and why he was knocking on my door every day. He didn't respond, he just kept staring at me. I began to feel uneasy and closed the door, locking it behind me.\n\nThe knocking continued every day, and I found myself growing more and more paranoid. I started to look out the window before opening the door, trying to see if the man was there. I even started to leave the house through the back door, just to avoid him.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore. The constant knocking was driving me insane, and I knew I had to do something. I decided to go to the police and report the man. But when I went to the station, they just laughed at me and told me there was nothing they could do unless he threatened me or broke any laws.\n\nI was at my wit's end. I didn't know what to do or who to turn to. I started to feel like I was being watched all the time, and I couldn't shake the feeling that the man at my door was somehow connected to my every move.\n\nI began to isolate myself, staying inside my house all day and only going out at night. I was too afraid to leave during the day, when the man might be outside waiting for me. I stopped answering the door, and I turned off all the lights in my house so he couldn't see me.\n\nBut even that wasn't enough. I started to hear the knock even when I was inside, as if the man was somehow able to reach through the walls and knock on the door from the inside. I began to fear for my safety and my sanity.\n\nI knew I couldn't go on living like this. I had to find a way to stop the man from knocking on my door every day. So I packed a bag and left in the middle of the night, hoping to put as much distance between myself and the man as possible.\n\nI don't know where I'm going or what I'm going to do, but I can't stay here any longer. The man's knock echoes in my head, and I know that as long as he's out there, I'll never be truly safe. I'll have to keep running and hiding, every day, for the rest of my life.\n\nI had been on the run for weeks, moving from town to town and staying in cheap motels under a different name each time. I thought I had left the man and his relentless knocking far behind me, but I was wrong.\n\nI was staying in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and I had just settled into my room for the night when I heard it - the familiar knock at the door. My heart sank as I realized that the man had somehow found me, even after all this time.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I was too terrified to leave the room, but I knew I couldn't stay there either. I gathered my things and slipped out the window, crawling through the bushes and running as fast as I could through the dark streets.\n\nI ran until my legs burned and my chest heaved, until I was sure I had left the town and the man behind. I collapsed in a field, panting and sobbing, and finally fell into an exhausted sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was back in my own bed, in my own house. I sat up with a start, my heart racing as I looked around the familiar room. It was all a dream, I told myself, just a nightmare.\n\nBut as I got up and went to the door, I saw the scratches on the wood where the man had been knocking. The dream had been too real, too vivid, for it to be just a nightmare. I knew the man was still out there, still searching for me, and I knew I had to keep running.\n\nI gathered my things and left the house, never looking back. I don't know where I'm going or what will happen to me, but I know I can't stay here. The man's knock will always be with me, a constant reminder that I can never truly escape him.\n\nI had been running for months, never staying in one place for too long and always looking over my shoulder. I was exhausted and terrified, but I couldn't stop. The man's knock was always with me, a constant reminder that he was still out there, still searching for me.\n\nOne night, I found myself in a small, run-down hotel in a sketchy part of town. I was about to drift off to sleep when I heard a knock at the door. My heart raced as I realized that the man had found me again.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I was too afraid to open the door, but I knew I couldn't stay in the room forever. I gathered my things and slipped out the window, running as fast as I could through the dark streets.\n\nI ran until my legs burned and my chest heaved, until I collapsed in an alleyway, gasping for breath. And then, out of nowhere, a voice spoke to me.\n\n\"Why do you run, my child?\" the voice said. \"You cannot escape me. I am everywhere and nowhere, a constant presence in your life.\"\n\nI looked up and saw a shadowy figure standing in front of me. It was the man from my door, but now he was different. His eyes were glowing red, and his face was twisted into a sinister smile.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I whispered, my voice shaking with fear.\n\n\"I am the one who knocked at your door every day,\" the man said. \"I am the one who has been following you, watching your every move. And I am the one who will never let you go.\"\n\nI realized then that the man wasn't just a stranger. He was the devil himself, and he had come for me.\n\nI remembered something my father had told me when I was a child. He had made a deal with the devil, trading his own soul for wealth and success. And now, the devil had come to collect on that deal, taking me as his due.\n\nI knew I had to run, to escape the devil's grasp. But it was too late. He had me in his clutches, and there was no escape.\n\nI closed my eyes and braced myself for the worst, but instead, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I opened my eyes to see a kind-faced man standing over me.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked.\n\nI realized then that it had all been a nightmare, a hallucination brought on by my fear and exhaustion. I was safe, at least for now.\n\nBut I knew that the devil was still out there, waiting for me. And I knew that as long as he was knocking at my door, I would always have to hide and run.",

        "text": "**The following journal entries were found in the home of Duane Findley of Ashbyburgh, Kentucky. Mr. Friday, in addition to four neighbors, has been missing since December 2018. Based on entry dates, it is believed that he left or was removed from his residence on Christmas day. If you or anyone you know has any information that may lead to the location of** ***The Ashbyburgh Five*****, please contact the Hopkins County Sheriff's Office.**\n\n*12/22/2018*\n\nHello there,\n\nI’m starting to get a little stir-crazy trapped in the storm, so I figure I may as well fill out a few pages of this old notebook to pass the time. It’ll give Dottie and the kids something to laugh about when they get home. They are warm and toasty down in Florida with her parents and I’m tucked away like a damn yeti here in Kentucky.\n\nJust for the record: You were right, Dot. I should have asked for vacation leave earlier. If I had, I wouldn’t be trapped in this winter wonderland.\n\nMy cellphone died yesterday and… well… we got rid of the landline years ago. Not that it would do much good anyway. The lines running by the road are drooping: a telltale sign that it has broken somewhere down the line.\n\nDoesn’t bother me too much, but I miss Dot and the kids. This storm doesn’t look like it will let up soon so I can’t imagine I’ll see them until well after Christmas. \n\nOh well. It is what it is.\n\nThe power’s been off since the 18th, I think. Snow has been coming down by the bucket full. Last time I checked, it was over a foot. That was about six hours ago. I’ll probably head outside after dinner and measure it again. Probably nearly two feet by now.\n\nI’m gonna need to put more wood in the barn next year. There should be enough out there to keep the fireplace going for another week, so I’m not worried, but this has shown me we need to be a little better prepared. The old gas furnace sure doesn’t do much good while the power is out.\n\nDot’s green thumb sure has come in handy. We’ve got more canned vegetables and homemade soup to feed me until the end of days. At least I won’t be hungry! Tired of vegetable beef soup, maybe. But definitely not hungry.\n\nTook everything out of the fridge and shoved it in the snow just off the side of the porch. It’s a pain in the ass to walk outside to get the coffee creamer every morning, but at least everything didn’t spoil. Could have been worse.\n\nI guess I’ll wrap this up. The sun is going down and I need to haul in some more firewood. Don’t want the fire to get too low!\n\nLooks like John and Patsy Rainey down the road made a snowman. Kinda funny. It is sitting down by their mailbox. Doesn’t seem like a good idea for two folks in their late seventies to be building snowmen in this kind of weather, but I guess they are getting stir-crazy too.\n\nSmoke is billowing from their chimney so I guess they survived their arctic adventure. That’s good.\n\nUntil tomorrow,\n\nDuane\n\n*12/23/2022*\n\nThe snow is even deeper today and still falling. Two feet when I measured it last night. I ended up bringing a shovel in from the garage and digging it into the ground just off the porch. It’s about four feet tall so I can just look out at it to get an idea of how deep it has gotten.\n\nDidn’t sleep as well last night. Part of it is sleeping on the couch near the fireplace. Makes my back feel like it was tied in a knot. Too damn cold to sleep in the bedroom though. Besides, I need to keep the fire going through the night and don’t want to leave it completely unattended. You never know when a log will pop and send an ember out of the hearth.\n\nThat wasn’t really the biggest problem though. It sounded like something was bumping against the house last night. Not knocking or slamming, just bumping. You know, like when a tree limb gets a little too long and taps against a house in a strong wind.\n\nOnly there are no trees close to the house. Nothing close to the house, as a matter of fact. \n\nThe first few times I heard it, I kind of ignored it. Tried to go back to sleep. It wasn’t constant, so it didn’t worry me too much. Closer to midnight though, it started to become more frequent. I timed it in my head. Something would thump against a different part of the house roughly every five minutes.\n\nI tried telling myself it was a squirrel or raccoon in the attic. It was a comforting lie, but in the back of my mind, I knew it wasn’t true. We installed a new roof, insulation, and flashing around the house last summer. Probably the best shape the roof has ever been in. Wouldn’t have left a spot for a critter to get inside.\n\nI crept through the house looking out the windows to see if I could spot what was making the noise. The thought had occurred to me that someone was trapped out in the storm and may be trying to get inside to get warm. It wasn’t likely, but hey, weirder things have happened.\n\nJust for a moment, I thought I spotted them. Through the guest bedroom window at the back of the house, I saw someone standing in the snow. Maybe a mile away. My heart raced. They just stood still as a stone at the end of the driveway from my other neighbors, the Stanleys. Smoke curled lazily from the chimney behind him.\n\nI watched the man peer toward my house for nearly fifteen minutes before it dawned on me.\n\nAnother damn snowman.\n\nI laughed and finished checking outside of the windows. There was nothing to see. All of the snow surrounding the house was undisturbed. No footprints. No wading path. Just pure sheets of glistening snow.\n\nI tossed a few more logs on the fire and curled up on the couch.\n\nThe soft bumps continued for the rest of the night, but I did my best to ignore them. \n\nHoping for better sleep tonight. Just finished up two bowls of Dot’s tomato soup with a couple of slices of stale bread. Maybe a full stomach will help me sleep more deeply.\n\nTime to wrap it up. I’m exhausted and need some rest. Maybe if I’m feeling squirrely tomorrow, I’ll go build my own damn snowman.\n\nUntil tomorrow,\n\nDuane\n\n*12/24/2018*\n\nThe snow is up to two and a half feet. Most of the shovel handle is gone. I’m getting worried.\n\nAlmost no sleep last night. The bumping noises were much louder and more frequent. Maybe every two or three minutes. I’d jump from the couch and look out the window on the side of the house where I had just heard the noise, but when I get there, there was not a damn thing to be seen. Undisturbed snow as far as the eye can see.\n\nNew snowmen, too. A half dozen of them. \n\nThey aren’t just by the neighbor's houses anymore. No, some of them look like they are in the middle of the unplowed road or out in the Stanley’s soy fields. Just random places. Farther away from the house than anyone would want to get in this God-forsaken storm.\n\nThe snowmen in my neighbor's yards look like they are closer to my house now, too. I’m not positive. Just seems that way. I can almost see the black coal specs of their faces and I don’t feel like I could before. Maybe my mind is just playing tricks on me. I don’t know.\n\nI’m just confused.\n\nThere’s no more smoke coming from either of my neighbors' houses either. It’s starting to worry me. The Stanleys are young enough that I think they are probably fine, but John and Patsy are old. This kind of cold could kill them.\n\nMaybe someone drove through the snow and got them out of the house.\n\nMaybe…\n\nI think I’ll try to go check on them in the morning.\n\nThe snow may slack off by then.\n\nI hope.\n\nUntil tomorrow,\n\nDuane\n\n*12/25/2018*\n\nMerry Christmas, I guess.\n\nThere were no noises last night so I slept like a log. Wish I hadn’t, though. When I woke up this morning, I nearly pissed my pants.\n\nStaring in through both living room windows were two massive snowmen. Heavy coal eyes beamed at me and a grizzly maw of twisted sticks made up the horrifying mouths. I fell onto the hearth and nearly shoved my hand into the fireplace trying to push myself away before I realized what it was. \n\nWhen it registered in my mind they were just snowmen, I started to laugh. I laughed until I cried, but not in that overly amused way. My tears were genuine panic and anxiety.\n\nI managed to get myself calmed down and looked out the window to see if I could spot the perpetrator. To my horror, there were dozens of snowmen surrounding the house. Nearly a hundred maybe.\n\nYet there wasn’t a single damn track in the snow.\n\nI’ve got to get the hell out of here. Maybe if I get up enough speed in the barn, the old four-wheel drive can plow through this mountain of snow. I feel like if I stay here another minute, I’ll go mad.\n\nDot, I love you and the kids. I’ll call as soon as I get to a phone. \n\nLove,\n\nDuane\n\n**A wellness check was performed by emergency crews on 12/28/2018 at the request of Dorothy Findley. The house was locked but there was no sign of Duane Findley. His pickup truck was found parked in the barn behind the house. The keys were discovered on a hook by the back door. No snowmen were seen in the vicinity of the house and no tracks were discovered coming or going from the property.**\n\n**If you have any information on the whereabouts of Mr. Duane Findley, please contact local authorities.

        "text": "We have all had that feeling of being watched havnt we. \n\nWell I have been watched nearly all my life so far. \n\nI am male 22 and live in the south of England and for years there has been a man I see in the corner of my eye. \nHe's big, dressed in black and he has always stood quite a few feet away from me but lately he's been getting closer.\n\nIve never see this man's face and I can never talk to him because as soon as I turn around he disappears.\n\nLet's start with a bit of back story. This man hasn't always been there my earliest memory of the man was when I was about 7 years old I had fallen over and cracked my skull open and briefly died for 2 minutes. It wasn't until I was outside being wheeled to the car that I noticed out the corner of my eye someone dressed in black but when I looked there was no one there. \n\nI didn't think anything off it at the time until later on throughout the years I kept noticing him out the corner of my eye just stood, watching. He appeared when I was walking home from school one day, I had just crossed the road and nearly got hit by a car and then there he was just out of my field of view, watching once again. \n\nThen there was the time I was 17 years old I had just bought my first motorbike it was a lovely yamaha tw 125 and 2 weeks into riding I had a nasty crash and ended up going under a bus knocking myself out. \nI was lucky that the bus at the time had stopped to pick people up because otherwise if it was moving I dont think I would have survived. But then again when I came to I could see the man again but this time he seemed to be a little closer. \n\nFast forward a couple of years I'm celebrating my 19th birthday up in  Bath with my friends at uni we all get stupidly drunk, smoke some weed, having a laugh. But then for whatever reason I stepped outside to have a cigarette. So there I was high and drunk. Cigarette in one hand and a beer in the other and I get this feeling I'm being watched so then I look around but can't see anyone. Until my brain realises actually I can see someone, the same someone I've been seeing for years but my brain has just shut it out. And yes there he is once again. The man although this time he is much closer just up the road from me. I can't make out any details except the black clothes and the hood up. Obviously me being obviously scared I run back inside. \n\nI've never told anyone about the man out of fear I'll get put somewhere for mental people. Because the same thing happened to my mum she could see people all the time that were not there but I just assumed that was because of the amount of drugs she used to be on.\n\nAnd then there was 2 weeks ago I saw the man again but this time he was only roughly 5-6 metres away from me. I had just gotten over this god awful illness that's been going round. Coughing my guts up like I'm sure you've all had aswell. Except this time I didn't just see the man with my own eyes I also saw the man in my sleep. \n\nSo these past couple of days I've been looking over my shoulder because now I feel constantly watched. The feeling never goes away but these past couple of days I havnt been seeing the man out the corner of my eye now I swear I see him in the mirror sometimes literally just a few feet away from me or sometimes very briefly directly on my shoulder but of course when I turn there is no one there and for some reason I still cannot make out any details apart from.... \n\nThe black clothes and the big black hood covering his face.",

        "text": "|[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyz010/aurora_part_1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|Part 2|\n\nWe huddled next to the tablet tracking Aurora’s location, excited at there finally being a way to stop her and bring her back. \n\n“Where is she again?”\n\n“She’s stopping at Cancún.”\n\n“Alright guys! It’s decided then, we’re going to Cancún.” Diana commanded, “Get your items, and don’t forget to bring your weapons. We might be gone for a long time, so pack accordingly and meet me in an hour. We need to stop her quickly before she moves on further away!”\n\n“We don’t have that many things anyways.” Sam quipped. And he was technically right. After all, we dedicated every waking moment to this project. We even lived in the very same building we worked in!\n\nRegardless, an hour later, we brought along bags of everything we needed on the journey to capture a runaway superhuman. Immediately, we hit the road with our trusty car, probably breaking a few traffic rules in our haste to reach the airport and board our flight quickly. As I stepped into the expansive airport building, I said, “Hey Diana, I have a question.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“How do we even disguise the gun?”\n\n“You’re supposed to have disassembled it earlier! That way they won’t notice it! Did you?”\n\nAfter a minute of furiously digging through my bag, I confirmed that the gun was, in fact, disassembled. Heaving a sigh of relief, we sprinted to our plane, not wanting to waste a second of time. After all, imagine what would happen if we delayed and let Aurora escape again!\n\nIn the plane, we began to strategise a plan on how to get Aurora.\n\n“Yo Sam”, I said, beckoning to the tablet in his palms, “Where is she now?”\n\n“Huh? Oh yeah, I’ll check that out.”, he responded. He plugged the charger in, turned on the tablet and opened the location tracker app. Zooming in the map, he said, “She seems to be somewhere in the Hotel Zone in Cancún. Hopefully she stays there until we get there!”\n\n“That’s good”, I said, “It’s familiar territory for me.”\n\nThe rest of the two hour plane trip went by uneventfully, until we reached Cancún. Exiting the airport, we immediately jumped into a taxi hired by Diana. Of course she had everything arranged beforehand… including another plan to get Aurora.\n\n“Here, take these.”, she said, handing out some white ID cards. When I got mine, I took a closer look at it and realised what she was planning.\n\n“Special Agent, Margaret Sherwood?”, I blurted out in confusion.\n\n“Of course! We’ll pretend to be from the FBI. There isn’t any other way to get in or ask for information without trouble.”\n\n“But isn’t that… illegal? Faking our identity?” Raj asked.\n\n“We have no other way to do this!” Diana replied.\n\nAfter that, there was no further planning until we were dropped off outside the hotel. It was a decently sized hotel with around 10 floors and a small concierge. And it looked familiar…\n\nOh wait. It was the hotel I went to several years ago with my friends.\n\n“Alright, two of you stay here, and I’ll tell you where to go depending on Aurora’s location. Oh, and I’ll need someone to come ambush wherever her room is.”, Diana explained.\n\n“I’ll come with you”, I volunteered, “I’ve been here a few times before. I know the layout.”\n\nDiana stared at me suspiciously for a moment, before responding, “Alright then. Come in with me.”\n\nWalking into the concierge, we stopped by the receptionist, and did exactly as we planned. “Hello, we are Diana Mulligan and Margaret Sherwood from the FBI. Is there a person of first name Aurora staying here? We require this for an investigation.”\n\n“Hold on, I need to call the manager.”\n\nI nervously waited for her response. Eventually, the manager came out. We repeated our statement, and flashed our ID cards at the manager. Luckily, she eventually bought our story.\n\n“We have a booking from an Aurora Mulligan. The unit is #05-011.”\n\nWe thanked her, before heading on into the hotel with a keycard. Next to me, Diana texted Raj a quick ‘go to the back and see if she escapes’.\n\n“Ugh, the nerve of her to use my surname of all things!” Diana vented as we entered the lift.\n\nI, meanwhile, was flooded with the old memories of staying here with my friends, almost twenty years ago. Regardless, I didn’t have time for these things, I had a job to do!\n\nAs we approached the room labelled ‘#05-011’, I raised my hand to knock at the door, but Diana stopped me.\n\n“No”, she whispered, “we need to storm in and get her if she’s in there.”. As my heart roared in my ears, she counted to three and slid the keycard in the lock. Immediately, we shoved open the door and ran in… only to find no one.\n\nOk, not no one at all, but…\n\n“Oh my god! Who is that!”, I shrieked as I looked up. From the fan, a body was hanging from a noose, eyes bulging out from its sockets. His hair, too, was matted with blood from some sort of head injury. \n\nDiana, too, seemed sufficiently shocked. Mouth agape, she stared at the gory scene above. “What did she even do here?”, she muttered. In our shock, we didn’t notice Aurora creeping in.\n\n“Looking at something?”, she asked from behind me.  \n\n“You- get her!”, I yelled, startled as we whirled around and aimed at her.\n\nFaster than I could anticipate, she knocked the gun out of my hands and shoved me against the wall before pushing a pistol next to my head. “Nope, too late!”, she said with glee.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw Diana take aim at Aurora again.\n\n“Nooooo don’t shoot!”, I yelled involuntarily. I was in the range of fire too, after all!\n\n“What the hell did you even do to this guy!”, Diana asked angrily.\n\nShe flicked her green eyes up dismissively. “Nothing much. I have all his stuff and he outlived his usefulness anyways.”.\n\n“Anyways, now I’m done with getting my passport.”. She flashed a maroon passport that said ‘European Union, Republic of Bulgaria’. \n\n“...W- w- what the hell? Y- you need to stop and come with us now!”, I stuttered, finally finding my voice. \n\n“Oh, really? And waste the effort I took finding someone to counterfeit this?” she responded, waving the passport in my face. “Oh, and like the name here? Jane Mulligan?”, she asked Diana mockingly, putting particular emphasis on the ‘Mulligan’.\n\nJust then, the man hanging above me groaned, still horrifically alive in some way or the other. For the first time, Aurora appeared to be caught off her feet.\n\nShe rubbed her chin in thinking, the same way I saw Diana do back in the lab when she was puzzling over a report. “How are you still alive even?”, she mused coldly.\n\nBefore I could even process what happened, she deftly pulled out a kitchen knife from her pocket and flicked it upwards, stabbing him straight in the heart. He screamed one last guttural scream as blood squirted like a fountain from his body, before finally dying .\n\n“Well, the security guards must be coming soon. Goodbye!”, she said with childlike glee, before hastily grabbing a brown duffel bag from a corner table and sliding out of the window. Multiple thuds from the building ledges could be heard outside, so she was definitely going down to the ground.\n\nAs I stood there frozen, Diana shook me out of my stupor. “Margaret! We have to leave now! Before anyone else comes in!”. Heeding her advice, I tucked my gun back into my bag (thankfully, she didn’t take it with her) before hurriedly sneaking out of the room and hotel building. Outside, we heard gunshot sounds from the area below her window.\n\n“That’s got to be Raj and Sam! Hurry!”\n\nIndeed, by the time we got to the back corner of the hotel, Raj and Sam were already firing at Aurora, trying to halt her escape. She, however, managed to perceive and dodge every bullet shot at her.\n\nInstinctively sprinting to their location, I took out my gun and began firing at her madly, the sounds of the bullets ringing in my ears. Despite her not returning fire, we still could not get a single shot on her.\n\nEven Sam, who was almost right next to her, couldn’t get a straight shot at her. Why couldn’t he shoot her?\n\nOh, right. His hands were shaking. Hell, his entire body was trembling! I made a mental note to ask him about that later.\n\nGrabbing onto the wall of the hotel compound, Aurora deftly scaled over it and threw herself over. A thud was heard on the other end as she landed hard on her feet, before leaping away into the road.\n\n“We can’t chase her like this! Get a taxi or something!” Raj suggested as he ran for the exit. The rest of us, too, began running for the exit in our pursuit to find her before she got too far away.\n\n“Sam!” I yelled when I saw him still standing at the back of the hotel, shell-shocked. “Come with us!”. Startled, he too followed us out. \n\n“Taxi!” Diana yelled out. The white car she gestured at immediately stopped, and the driver poked his head out. “Where going?”\n\nAs we climbed in, she explained, “Go straight for now! Just follow my directions!”\n\nBy this time, of course, Aurora was already way ahead of us. After several twists, turns, and twenty minutes, I finally noticed something I never expected to see.\n\nOn the pavement, when I looked out, I saw Aurora’s blonde head disappear behind a corner.\n\n“There she is!”, I cried out. “Turn left, we have her!”\n\nHowever, when we turned there was no sign of anyone having been there.\n\n“Look at the tracker! She ran off the main roads!” Diana alerted. “We have to do this on foot!”.\n\nImmediately, we bolted out of the car after Diana hurriedly fished out some peso notes from her pocket for the driver. In the muggy midday Cancún heat, we scampered around shady run-down alleys and narrow side roads lined with houses in an attempt to follow the tracker, but we never saw Aurora anywhere! \n\nNext thing we knew, she was kilometres away from us and at the airport. Or, at least, that’s what the tracker said. As the estimated altitude on her tracker rose higher and higher, we knew that she had once again given us the slip and ran.\n\n“Damn it”, complained Raj, as we sat in a small restaurant eating tacos. “She got us good, and now she’s off to some random corner of the world again!”.\n\n“Yeah, that’s true”, I added, “we don’t even know where she’s going given the direction the tracker is showing!”\n\nJust then, Diana’s phone rang in her pocket. “Hold on guys, I have to go answer this call.”. As she stepped out, we looked at each other in bewilderment. Who would even call her, particularly at this time?\n\nA few minutes of talking later, she walked in with significantly more tension in her step.\n\n“Who was it?”, I asked curiously.\n\n“An agent from the corp, apparently.”\n\n“Which corp?”\n\n“You know, the one whose dime we’re travelling on?”\n\n“Oh right.”\n\n“Anyways”, interjected Raj, “What did they even say?”\n\n“They said that they were aware of the situation and would support us when we needed it. They also authorised us to kill Aurora if needed. Oh, and they don’t want us to contact the police.”\n\n“They don’t?” Sam asked. “Why? We need to let them know”\n\n“I’m not sure, but orders are orders.”, Diana brusquely replied. While it was evident that Sam disapproved of this command, he did not oppose it too much.\n\n“And one more thing. They have figured out her next destination.”, she continued.\n\n“Where is it?”\n\n“Istanbul.”\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/NightbringerWrites/)",

You tell me.\"  \n\n\n\"And for you, Mister...Peterson?\"  \n\n\n\"Not my name, but a cappuccino, no sugar,\" he replied.  \n\n\n\"No milk, no human flesh, or anything else disappointing.

Actually, they are the ONLY regulars we have. I don't know why this place hasn't closed yet. Actually, it's because my boss, a really rich guy, wants a place where he can drink his morning coffee and smoke his cigarettes in peace. Not that doing all these anywhere else in this town would be any less peaceful. This town is small.  \n\n\nI met these police officers two months ago when I happened to help on a case in which I was a victim. Since then, they stop by every two days and tell me about the stuff that's happening around town. I even get access to restricted information from time to time. I help with their investigations. At one point, they even invented a story to involve me in a case so I could help them officially.  \n\n\n\"Asher, what's taking you so long? I crave caffeine,\" Sarah asked with an exhausted but still \"I'm nicer than you\" voice.  \n\n\n\"Take up smoking. You'll never have to wait again, nor will you have the money to buy coffee,\" I replied.  \n\n\nSarah usually orders a mocha, that's her usual. As for the second usual, that means two of the same thing. Dave usually orders something new every time, but cappuccino seems to be his go-to.  \n\n\n\"Here's your coffee. A hard day at work, I presume,\" I said.  \n\n\n\"I would kill to have your job, boy,\" Dave said jokingly.  \n\n\n\"You can always kill Trevor,\" That's the other barman. He works 8 AM to 4 PM, and I take over from there.  \n\n\n\"I wouldn't do that. He's a good boy! But I'll tell you who isn't. Our number one suspect for the newest murder case,\" Dave said.  \n\n\n\"I'm listening,\" I replied.  \n\n\n\"Oh, can we please not do that right now?\" Sarah said, seeming very much against it. \"Let me have 10 minutes of normality today.\"  \n\n\nI sat down with them. Sarah is a 21-year-old, 5'11\", brunette lady who joined the police force about a year ago. Dave, on the other hand, has had this job for 12 years. He's in his early 30s, has a big brown beard, he's 3 inches taller than me, standing at the massive height of 6'3\", and he's a bit overweight. Both of them are hard workers and have a strong sense of justice. After 10 minutes of casual chatting, they finished their drinks.  \n\n\n\"Can I speak now, Miss Police?\" Dave asked jokingly.  \n\n\n\"I might arrest you later for giving out confidential information to a civilian, but it's your decision,\" the brunette woman replied.  \n\n\n\"I'll take the risk,\" Dave replied hastily. \"You see, boy, a mass murder happened today. Three people were found dead in an apartment after a concerned neighbor called the police. The caller said he heard two shots, and the other neighbors confirmed, but we have 3 bodies, all of them with a bullet in their skull. Two of the bullets are from the same gun, the third one not so much. We found no guns at the crime scene. What's weird is that none of the ex-humans live there. We contacted the owner of the apartment, and he's been on a business trip for 4 days now. He also has no idea who any of the dead men are. There are no signs of breaking and entering, although we didn't find any key on the bodies, and the owner said no one should have access to it except for him. What else...\" He paused.  \n\n\n\"What about their names?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"Oh right. James Carter, an ex-marine with PTSD, Harlen Garcia, a construction worker, and Kevin Main,\" Dave replied.  \n\n\n\"Wait, the same Kevin Main you told me about last week?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"Yes, the supposed drug dealer we've been keeping an eye on. So, what do you think, Mister Ex-Detective? Who's behind it this time?\"  \n\n\n\"Give me a second to think,\" I said.  \n\n\n\"Work your magic, Asher!\" Sarah said enthusiastically.  \n\n\n\"Give me more to work with. An agent's been following Kevin, right?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"That's the thing. We had someone following him. He claimed our suspect went to sleep at his usual bedtime and likely sneaked out through one of his windows, one that was found unlocked when they searched his house today,\" Dave replied.  \n\n\n\"What about his connections? Was he ever seen with the other guys?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"Nope, and his phone says the same. That goes for the other guys too,\" Dave replied.  \n\n\n\"I'm guessing this 'sneaking out' hasn't happened before. Which one was shot with the second gun?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"That would have to be James Carter, the marine guy,\" Dave replied.  \n\"Whose apartment were they found in?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"I can't tell you his real name for reasons. Let's call him John,\" Dave said.  \n\n\n\"Were the bullets shot one after another?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"The neighbor said there was a 5 second delay,\" Dave replied.  \n\n\n\"Two important details you missed, Peterson,\" Sarah said in her \"detective\" voice. Dave gave her a disappointed look and muttered something. \"First, Harlen's daughter died, not long ago, from an overdose. Second, Kevin had a 5 pound bag of meth on him.\"  \n\n\nThis information is a little too much, so let's recap. Sometime last night, Kevin Main sneaked out of his house with a 5 pound bag of meth in his possession. At some point, he arrived at the residence of John, who's been on a business trip for the past couple days, along with James Carter, an ex-marine, and Harlen Garcia, a construction worker whose daughter died from an overdose. At 3 in the morning, two shots were fired with a 5 second delay. A neighbor called the cops, and when they arrived, they found the bodies of all 3 men on the ground.  \n\n\n\"I don't think I can help you with this one,\" I said after a short pause. \"But what do you think about it?\"  \n\n\n\"Me, I think it was a bloody mess,\" Dave said. \"I'm not paid enough to think.\"  \n\n\n\"I think the dealer was there to sell his stuff, and the construction worker was following him to take revenge for his daughter. As for how or why they were in that apartment, I have no idea, but like Dave said, bloody mess. How come you can't solve this, Asher?\" Sarah asked.  \n\n\n\"Well, I need more time to think,\" I replied. \"I could let you know if I figure out anything, but I would need your phone number for that.\"  \n\n\n\"Not in a million years,\" Sarah replied.  \n\n\n\"You have mine,\" Dave said. \"I'd better get going. Jane's food just isn't the same after 10:30 PM.\"  \n\n\n\"I'm going too. I don't want to be left alone with a wannabe detective or possibly a serial killer,\" Sarah said.  \n\n\n\"Have a good night, you too. I promise I won't forget you when I go big,\" I said.  \n\n\nDave raised his hand, and Sarah turned and gave me a smile as they left the shop. All I was left with was 3 cups to clean, a shop to close, and a big case on my mind. \"If this kind of crime would happen every day, there would be no one left in the town by the time I turn 30,\" I thought to myself. That's 10 years from now. I left the shop and locked the door.  \n\n\n\"Hey,\" a deep male voice with malice came from behind me.  \n\n\nI turned around as fast as I could and tried to hit whoever was behind me. He blocked, but the distraction worked, as I managed to pull out my secret card, pepper spray. The guy reacted quickly, but he didn't manage to block all of it. I ran away, and after a couple seconds, he took off after me. He was screaming something, but stopped and started coughing instead. Maybe my pepper spray got in his nose or mouth. My adrenaline kicked in, and I was faster than him, but I wouldn't be able to keep the speed for 3 miles to reach my house. Maybe he had a gun. I couldn't risk going straight; I had to try dodging bullets if he started shooting. The closest house was a quarter mile away. Maybe if I could reach it, I could scream for help. I looked behind to see if he gave up, but sure enough, he was still on my tail, closing in, maybe 30 feet away. 29, 28, 27, 26. I was getting tired, and I couldn't keep up the speed, but I knew if I didn't run, I'd fall victim to whoever that was. I could see the house ahead of me, so I ran with all my force, screaming for help. As I got closer, I felt a sense of hope washing over me, but that all faded when I felt a glove touch my shoulder and pull me back. I fell. In those moments I could only think about how I was the fastest in my class in 4th grade, where did I go wrong?  \n\n\n\"You're pretty fast, kid,\" the man said as he stopped me from falling. \"I'm a detective.\"  \n\n\n\"You couldn't start with that?\" I asked, irritated.  \n\n\n\"You're pretty calm. You didn't seem angry at all just now,\" he replied.  \n\n\n\"Think straight in any situation. It doesn't run in the family,\" I said.  \n\n\n\"Your mom must have had an affair. I'm kidding. Sorry for scaring you earlier. I do that sometimes. I tried telling you I'm a detective, but your spray got in my nose.\"  \n\n\nA woman looked out the window of the house we were near.  \n\n\n\"Sorry for the noise, ma'am,\" the detective said, pulling out his badge. \"Everything's alright.\" The woman nodded and went back inside.  \n\n\n\"Mind telling me why you came to visit me?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"I'm just after some information,\" he replied as I silently started recording our conversation with my phone. \"Let's go to your house, and we'll have a talk.\"  \n\n\nWe walked to my house, and I pulled a pot of brown rice from my fridge. He said he didn't mind waiting for me to prepare the food, so I did. I gave him a portion when I was done, and we started eating.  \n\n\n\"You know, this is pretty good. I should start eating healthier too,\" he said.  \n\n\n\"What did you want to talk about?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"So, I heard you talking to Sarah and Dave,\" he said.  \n\n\n\"You planted a bug?\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"Sure did. They're not supposed to give information to a civilian, but I'm willing to let that slide if you help me on the case they told you about,\" he replied.  \n\n\n\"You're more or less blackmailing me,\" I pointed out.  \n\n\n\"Come on, we're all friends here!\" he said.  \n\n\n\"I didn't even know your name,\" I said.  \n\n\n\"Oh right, what was I thinking. My name is Richard Gremor. You can call me Richard,\" he replied.  \n\n\n\"You're the popular guy, I knew I recognized you from somewhere. They talk about you on the news whenever you solve a big case,\" I said.  \n\n\n\"Between us, I don't like attention that much, I just do my job,\" he replied.  \n\n\n\"How would you feel if I pressed send on this recording of all we've talked about until now? You didn't identify yourself before coming into my house and tried to blackmail me,\" I asked.  \n\n\n\"First of all, I don't care that much, second of all, I think I'm pretty reasonable, third of all, that would mean your friends from the police station would get fired for their actions. We both know you're not going to send that. But good move, you're smart kid. And I see it in your eyes, you want to tell me what you think about the case. Why didn't you tell the others your true thoughts?\" he asked.  \n\n\n\"It seemed too complicated, I thought maybe there is a simpler explanation,\" I replied.  \n\n\n\"I will, so how about I show you two pictures from the crime scene and then you start talking,\" he said, pulling out some photos. He pointed to the first one. \"The first corpse, the marine's, was found at the entrance of the bedroom. He was shot from his left from the corner of the bedroom.\" He pointed to the second picture. \"The construction worker was shot in the dining room, which connects the bedroom and the entrance. He was shot near the window from the bedroom door and the drug dealer was shot at the entrance from the same place.\"  \n\n\n\"I see,\" I said. \"X, an acquaintance of the apartment owner, whom I'll call John, arranged all of this. X knew that John would leave town and somehow made a copy of his key. Maybe he has something against him or he just didn't have any other place to do this. X contacted three people. X contacted the ex-marine, who he probably had something against, to come over to John's apartment. X contacted the construction worker and convinced him that the guy who sold his daughter drugs was Kevin. X promised him he'd help him get revenge if he protected him from someone. X contacted the drug dealer and said he'd buy a big bag of meth if he followed his instructions exactly by sneaking out of his house and coming in 10 minutes after the marine went inside. That day, X showed the construction worker that the drug dealer was staying outside to show him he wasn't lying about their deal and gave him a gun, with a silencer, with which he shot the marine guy. X then took the gun from the marine or just had a second one and waited for Kevin to come. As the moment came near, Harlen became nervous and X took the chance to shoot him the moment Kevin came in the room. He then aimed at the drug dealer who thought he was saved and killed him too.\"  \n\n\n\"Bravo Mr. Ex-Detective, you really are K.\"  \n\n\n\"What?\" I replied baffled.  \n\n\n\"I have to go. Thank you for your time,\" he said, standing up.  \n\n\n\"I don't get it. You're kind of an asshole, you know that?\"  \n\n\n\"It's fine, I'll contact you again.\" I thought that was the end of it but as he turned to leave he looked me dead in the eyes and threw me a piece of paper. Something cryptic was written on in: \"Someone's playing a really fucked up game, we are the prey.\"\n\nI know this is an abrupt ending, but I'm a bit overwhelmed right now. I will update you on the situation as soon as I can. Please feel free to ask any questions, I'll try replying to them in my next post.",

        "text": "Earlier in the month I had agreed to help my friend setup her New Year’s Eve party, and that I’d—by virtue of being there—attend and hangout for a while, even though I’m not exactly the most sociable person.  \n\nIt was at this party that a very strange, and ultimately terrible thing happened to me.  \n\nWhile setting up her “bar” (a counter on which she’d placed a few bottles of booze and several festive shot glasses) I heard a sort of *pinging* sound coming from her laundry room. We were the only ones in the house, and she was in the garage looking for some candles she’d put away after Thanksgiving, to bring out during the countdown later in the night. Not recognizing the sound, I put aside the glasses I’d been stacking and went to the laundry room.  \n\nIt was empty, in the sense that there wasn’t anything notably out of order. But just as I was about to turn away, I saw a small black object, nestled almost out of sight beneath a shirt in a laundry basket. I reached inside and pulled it out, and heard—clearer now—that same pinging sound. It was a Bluetooth speaker.  \n\nJust then, my friend’s voice sounded from behind, nearly giving me a heart attack.  \n\n“I’m sorry. I really am. But you know how I am about prophetic stuff...and it’s not like anyone but me would miss you, anyway. I know you were probably joking, but I do remember you saying you’d like to be in one of those ‘dying so others may live’ scenarios common in all those movies you watch.”  \n\nBefore I could even turn around to face her, she shut the door. The clicking, bolting sounds of some mechanism being locked in place signified that she had, for some strange, ominous reason, locked me inside her laundry room.  \n\nPanic set in almost immediately, as I realized that she was being serious about whatever dark plot she’d decided to undertake. I then heard several voices begin to whisper in a language that sounded only loosely human; as if something from every civilized language had been taken and repurposed into some new, universal tongue. Steeped in darkness, rendered immobile by my fright, I merely stood beside the washing machine as the incantatory speech went on and on, and the voice grew deeper, graver.  \n\nFinally, that mundane darkness took on a more palpable form, becoming almost sinister in nature. It enveloped me, stamping out what little light there’d been in the room—and in my heart.  \n\nThough I couldn’t see what was going on, I felt myself being spirited away from that room; and even then, I knew that the nature of my transportation was super-scientific, if not sorcerous. \n\nAfter a period of blind yet dizzying travel through some back alley of space-time, the world around me resolved into being once more. Though it was not any world with which I was familiar.  \n\nI suddenly found myself standing in a massive, dusty chamber, grey-walled and high-ceilinged. There were no signs of my friend; but, like a dream speedily fading away upon awaking, I heard the voices of those unseen whispers quickly drawing away, at last becoming inaudible as the darkness finished clearing from my sight. Deeply disturbed, and reaching new heights of fear with every dust-choked breath, I stumbled forward into chamber.  \n\nAnd found myself staring into the depths of several corridors, their thresholds bearing no indication of what lied beyond.  \n\nA massive cauldron of some dark, green-tinged metal sat in the nexus of the corridors, bubbling with some unwholesome substance. Its rim was coated with a dark yellow residue, practically seared into the very metal; and oily streaks trailed endlessly from the surface. The stuff inside boiled hellishly, and gave off a stench as of burning tallow. \n\nEven though I couldn’t see inside, I nonetheless felt sure that—given the evidence of what had leaked out—the undoubtedly yellowish contents were thick, slimy, and of a clumpy, waxy consistency. Something about it deeply disturbed me, even as the more animal parts of my brain sensed a certain palatability about the mysterious brew.  \n\nThere was an atmosphere of endless, ever-ripening putrefaction about the structure; and there was even a visible cloud of sallow vapor that had risen and settled above the cauldron’s surface. There was something profoundly offensive about it, revolting in a way that I can scarcely describe. It was obvious that it had not been created for the preparing of food suitable to human diets. Something *else* feasted upon the disgusting, molten contents.  \n\nThe walls nearest to the cauldron bore a slimy residue, which also dripped from the ceiling, as if the environing surfaces were alive with a porous sickness. I gave the cauldron a wide berth, not wanting to inhale the miasmal gases. Several corridors spanned from this central node, each continuing on into an impenetrable gloom. I chose one at random and started down it, fearful more of the cauldron I was leaving behind than the dark uncertainty towards which I was heading.  \n\nThere was a dim ambience about the corridor I’d chosen, one that gradually grew until it became startling for its audibility. It imparted a sense of great immensity, of spaces borderless and boundless, wherein echoed every drop of sub-surface water.  \n\nThe air grew cleaner as I went, for which I was very thankful; I hadn’t noticed before, but I realized then that the atmosphere near the cauldron was stifling, almost nauseating. The dark, interminable hall was, in comparison, a much more respirable place to be.  \n\nEventually, after who knows how long, I came upon the end of the corridor. There was no threshold, no door—merely a steep drop into cavernous nothing. The corridor simply ended at a void, though not one completely devoid of structure and form. It was more so a geologically sprawling chasm, impossibly far-spanning and without ceiling, but having the rocky attributes common to caves of lesser degree. The ambience of vast hollowness resounded endlessly, like some world-eating horror letting out a perpetual yawn. There was light, though I couldn’t figure out from where it was coming. It was simply *there*, dimly illuminating this ultramundane space.  \n\nMovement to my right drew my attention away from the bottomless emptiness, and I turned toward it with a little relief. But that relief was quickly transformed into despair when I saw a man in a dust and grime-smeared blue suit put one foot over the edge of the floor—having undoubtedly emerged from some other corridor that also let out onto this bizarre space. I began to shout, hoping to implore him to step back; but stopped when my voice echoed back to me distorted, warped by that titanic nothing. The man either did not hear my words or paid them no mind, because he continued his progress forward.  \n\nWithout a word, without turning toward me, he plunged headlong into that hypogeal abyss. Helplessly, I watched him fall, and my heart fell with him. ‘There were no sounds of impact. No noises which might’ve given any indication that the man had reached a bottom—alive or dead. Neither did he scream or cry out, as if he had long ago resigned himself to the fatal descent.  \n\nFilled with a chilling dread, I stepped away from the threshold and turned back toward the place from which I had come: the massive cauldron of boiling fat.  \n\nBack at the cauldron, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something deeply wrong about the chasm, beyond the near unreality of its size and emptiness. My voice had sounded extremely strange when it reverberated back to me. It had sounded, for lack of a better word, “unclean”, as if the very notes had been taken and poisoned by something in the depths before being flung back at me. It was deeply unnerving to think about, and so I refocused my mind on escaping, even as the noisome funk of the cauldron threatened to send me retching onto the floor.  \n\nIgnoring the putrid dankness, I again circumnavigated the cauldron, this time choosing a path opposite from the one I’d taken before. The corridors were virtually indistinguishable: The same dank walls, the same march towards darkness; the same lessening of the air’s pollution by that sinister stew. And again I came to an abrupt end, beyond which lied that cavernous nothing.  \n\nTerror trickled intravenously through me, and I found myself suddenly fighting to stay calm—if not sane. Putting a hand on a wall to steady myself, I brought my breathing under control. “This can’t be real. This can’t be happening. What’s going on?” My voice came out shaky. I couldn’t remember a time where I’d been nearly as frightened as I was just then. And yet I sensed that there were more horrors to come, more terror to endure before I could escape.  \n\nJust when I had brought my breathing and heart under control, I heard something that sent them into fits again. From far down hall came a harsh sound, like shoes dragging on the stone floor. It silenced me, the loudness of it; and it soon became obvious that the sounds were coming closer, approaching me with a grim steadiness. With only the void to my back, I had nowhere to go.  \n\nAfter a few moments of mounting terror, a figure appeared in the gloom ahead; a figure that was thankfully humanoid. Still, I felt myself tense up, sensing a subtle yet unmistakable quality of *inhumanity* about the person.  \n\nTheir feet dragged as they neared, as if they had long ago given up their mind or spirit. Finally, they stepped into the scope of light emitted by the ominously luminous cavern, and I saw them in full detail. They were, as I had noticed, human; but the mortal kinship between us ended there. It was a man, who had at some point in the far-distant past been a businessman of some kind. He wore a tattered suit and tie, not dissimilar to what the *other* man had worn, though plainly much older. Hic clothes were practically falling off his wiry frame, and had faded to some nigh indescribable color between grey and white.  \n\nHis face was outright ghoulish, the cheeks sunken and almost leprous with spots and abrasions. His scalp was bald, and the oddly textured surface suggested that his hair had fallen out some time ago. I suspected that the cause of the deathly pallor and the pockmarked flesh was the emissions of the cauldron. The fumes, more than any passage of time, had probably caused this man’s decrepit appearance.  \n\nWith eyes that seemed to have stared for too long on that vacuous immensity behind me, he looked at me—abruptly stopping his shuffled march.  \n\n“Ah, I see we’ve got another. What year are you, if you wouldn’t mind me asking?”  \n\nI involuntarily leapt back, having been caught off guard by the man’s scratchy and guttural voice. That voice, I suspected, hadn’t been used in a long, long time. If a mummy could speak, that’d be the voice it would use.  \n\nWhen I regained a little of my composure—a period during which he simply stared—I asked him to clarify the meaning of his question, since I hadn’t any idea of what he’d meant.  \n\n“Ah, you are very new, then. On my back, there is a number. Tell me what it is, will you? It’s been so long, I’ve forgotten it. Once you do that, I’ll do the same for you...and then we’ll both know from *when* we came.”  \n\nThe man then turned around, showing me his back. The clothing between his shoulder blades had been burned away, revealing a broad patch of skin. Four numbers were blackly displayed there, embossed from the pale flesh as if they’d been branded, rather than written. Just as the man had said, the numbers made a year: 1982. More so out of shock than compliance with the man’s wishes, I said the number aloud, and he nodded in remembrance.  \n\n“Ah, that’s right. I’d just seen a move. What was it? The...*Something*. I was with friends, we were leaving the theater. We’d really enjoyed the film, were talking about it. And then...darkness. I was—selected. There’d been mention of a prophecy—a necessary sacrifice.” \n\nHe turned back to me, his face streaming with tears. I wouldn’t have thought it possible, considering the desiccated state of his body.  \n\n“Go on, then. Turn around. Let’s see your year.”  \n\nStill in shock at the absurdity of the situation, I wordlessly complied. My eyes stared ahead, not wanting to focus on any particular area of that illimitable vastness. \n\n“Oh, you’re quite far ahead of me. 2023.”  \n\nMy body went rigid. Ahead of me, the cavernous darkness seemed to beckon me onwards. Somehow, I’d been taken from the *wrong time.* In my timeline, it was still 2022—of that I was certain. The NYE party hadn’t even started, yet.  \n\nAnd yet seared into my back was the year 2023, which was—which should’ve been—hours away. The day had only just started. \n\nThrough sheer force of will I managed to relieve my body of its rigidity, turning around to face the man; though I couldn’t help the tremors that arose a moment later. As if I hadn’t spoken in weeks, I stammered out that there’d been some sort of mistake—that I was from the year 2022, not 2023. But the man’s eyes, still glossy with tears, only stared. After a moment of inscrutable silence, he motioned back, presumably toward the noxious cauldron.  \n\n“There are three choices left to those who’ve been transported here. The first: sacrifice themselves to the cauldron, thus ensuring that the year from which they hail—*or to which they will soon go*—will be free of major cataclysm. The second: wander these halls aimlessly, in the hopes that they’ll someday find escape, or that the system somehow changes...or crumbles altogether. The third, reject the system entirely, and jump into the abyss. What lies beyond is unknown. It could be death, a return to the past—or future.  \n\nThere is no basis of time, here. All continuities past and present may coexist within these corridors, for as long as need be. The only thing that matters is The Choice. So, I suppose you could say in essence there are really only two options: *Sink in the soup*, or don’t.”  \n\nDespite the small jest, there was no mirth in the man’s expression. Bleakness and a sorrow immeasurable were etched into his sunken features.  \n\n“I’ve just recently made my choice, having been here for...well, I can’t really say, can I? I’ve come across people from a century in the future, so I can’t very well base my time spent here on anything concrete.”  \n\nHoping to find a flaw in the man’s explanation of the system—and perhaps a way to escape it—I countered, “Wouldn’t that mean that it doesn’t matter what we do, if people of the future exist? There obviously hasn’t been a cataclysm awful enough to wipe out humanity as we know it.”  \n\nHe smiled, though it was a sad, knowing smirk; as if he’d been grimly expecting the question. \n\n“No, not at all. As I said, time does not operate here. All years, all temporal potentialities, arrive here at some point. There is no chronology, no order of being. I suspect that, if we had to be placed anywhere in a timeline, it’d be at the beginning. I figure this place predates time itself.”  \n\nMy mind reeled at the sheer cosmic unreality of the idea. I couldn’t mentally grasp the concept of being some pre-temporal entity, of my choices determining a future yet recorded. Seeing my incredulity, the man smiled his sad smile again, and placed a withered hand on my shoulder. \n\n“Be well, traveler. May you find what peace you can in these corridors, or the space beyond them.”  \n\nWalking past me, he stepped to the edge of the corridor. He seemed to settle himself, shrugging off the years that had accumulated atop his tired shoulders. I couldn’t see his face, but I was sure that, in the end, he smiled. Not the sorrow-filled smile of before, but one of genuine happiness.  \n\n“Oh, one last thing. There is a particular corridor with a special wall. On it are written the epitaphs of those who’ve come and gone. You may write one yourself, if you wish. Some are merely a few lines; others are practically novels. Somehow, those words find their way to the world—to the regular flow of time. Not always the exact year from which the authored hailed, but close. Maybe it would bring you some peace to recount your tale—or simply say goodbye.”  \n\nHe then stepped forward, plunging himself into the yawning depths with a certain morbid stoicism.  \n\nI turned away with tears in my eyes, even though I hadn’t known the man for more than a few moments.  \n\nHaving seen the aged, decrepit state of that man, I determined then to promptly make my choice. I didn’t want to linger in that dismal realm, doomed to roam the purgatorial labyrinth forever. But first, I would find the wall, and write something on it.  \n\nIt was not difficult to locate the wall; in fact, it felt as if being made aware of it somehow brought it to the forefront of the maddening maze. Upon returning to the cauldron, I took another corridor at random, and came across a wall down which spanned the inscriptions and scribblings of past wanderers—whomever they’d been.  \n\nIt would take more time that I’d care to spend in this prison to share even a few of self-written epitaphs, so I will only say that a disconcerting amount were from years far in the past; nearer to the earliest civilizations of man, than my own time. Some of the languages I recognized, others were of styles and lexicons beyond my knowledge; I’d even dare to say that a few were of a linguistic order entirely inhuman—but the implications of such an idea are far too profound to be discussed with any substance, here.  \n\nIt is on this wall, beneath the infinitely gloomy phrase, “I am a revenant—doomed to wander and haunt the halls; denied both death and life”, that I’ve written my tale. I have more or less detailed all that’s happened to me, and am now saying my goodbyes: to the world, to my life...to time itself.  \n\nI don’t know what fate awaits me upon submergence in that foul cauldron, but if what the man had said is true; that in doing so I’ll prevent some awful cataclysm from happening, then it is only logical—only ethical—that I do it.  \n\nHeaven, Hell, or a thoughtless infinitude, here I come.",

        "text": "The following true story is based upon events that occurred earlier in my life. It is a tale that I have tried to write many a time, it is a dark tale of a haunting that my family and I experienced over the course of 10 years.  It is something that continues to cause upset and trouble even today, some 40 years after it started. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to live in a haunted house, then this article is for you.\n\nI am not asking anyone to believe me. If I had not seen these things with my own eyes I would not believe it. It has taken no small amount of courage to present this here before you, and this is to be my last attempt to tell this story in writing.  \n\n\nI fully accept that the following events are strange, and occasionally unbelievable. This recollection is presented from family notes and letters from over the years.  All I ask of you, the reader, is to approach this with an open mind, and to remember that these are events perceived to be real, by real people with feelings, myself included.  \n\n\nBelieve, or do not believe, that is your choice, and I cannot make it for you.  There are no photographs or pictures as other family members do not wish to be involved further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Events Unfold**\n\nAs with so many hauntings things started off in small ways. as if the entity was trying to gain momentum. I was about 4 years old and initially things happened after I was put to bed. I was always put to bed with the light off but it would turn itself on and off again periodically. This was witnessed on several occasions by my sisters, who would often check on me at night. The windows also seemed to develop a life of their own. A closed window would often be open the next time you walked past, even in the middle of winter. Already this was enough for some members of the family to question what was going on, or at the very least, their own sanity. I do remember thinking what fun it all was, and what a fuss was being made over a dicky light, or a wonky window, it all seemed quite innocent.  \n\n\nIt was then the banging started. It always came from upstairs, the front master bedroom. Heavy footfalls could be heard first, then the banging, always the same pattern. Often coinciding with the banging was a strange feeling of pressure building in ones ears, and a rushing noise that is hard to describe other than putting a sea shell over your ear. My dad was an honest to goodness working class Joe, and did the only logical thing which was to dismiss it as the neighbors thumping around, dodgy 1940's wiring and poor quality window catches.  \n\n\nIt wasn't just noises either. My brother-in-law saw a slightly built blond boy around 11-12 years old laughing and leaning on the stairway by the front door as he went to buy ice creams from the delivery van. Thinking that my brother had a friend visiting he came back with two extra ice creams, one for each of them. It took some convincing and a tour of the house to convince him that there was no one else in the house at that time. The event, although sounding comical really upset him, as he said it had seemed so real that he thought he could have reached out and patted the boy on the head.  \n\n\nThis wasn't the only time the blond boy was seen. The postman, coal man and other kids in the neighborhood stated asking about the new boy staying in our house, who was he and why didn't he come out to play with the rest of us? He was most often seen staring in a pensive way out of the window halfway up the stairs, between floors on a little landing.  \n\n\nAt this point my phobia of water began suddenly. Bath times were a nightmare of fear, and even flushing the toilet was something I could not bear to do. If I absolutely was made to flush, it was a quick pull on the lever and then I would run out as fast as humanly possible. There was something about the sound of the rushing water that just terrified me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **It was July 1980 and I heard my Mother scream**\n\nMy dad, sister and I rushed upstairs to see what had happened to find mum sitting on the floor shaking. She had gone to her wardrobe, a built in one with a solid door, and saw clear markings on the inside. The scratches were 1/8 of an inch deep into solid wood, and appeared to have been made with a sharpened end of a coat-hanger. The tool in question could not be found. As dad began to question which idiotic member of the family thought this was good joke all hell started to break loose, the lights began flickering on and off and the same banging noise could be heard by all of us. We ran out the room, seeking the relative safety of the living room downstairs. There was no doubt in mum's mind as to what we were dealing with, and decided to immediately confront the neighbors and see what they might have been holding out on.  \n\n\nThere we were, sat in the neighbors living room, coal fire clogging the air with filthy particles of soot as I remember thinking that they could not have had the Chimney Sweep in recently. As I said before, funny the things that you can remember. As soon as we told them our tale, the lady of the house seemed to know exactly who we might be dealing with. The previous family living in our house consisted of 2 recently divorced parents who had hooked up both having 2 kids from their previous marriages. The youngest had a history of playing truant from school and going swimming with his mates. On one fateful occasion he was off school with a cold, and knowing that he would try to go for a swim at the local lock, the mum had hidden his swimming trunks in the built in wardrobe in the front room. Of course he found them, having seen her go into the room shortly before leaving for work, and went straight to the lock to meet his friends.  \n\n\nThey described his drowning in the local paper graphically, witness said it had seemed as if some unseen hands were clawing at him to pull him under and hold him there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anger Increasing**\n\nMy father had never believed in ghosts and the suchlike. For him, if it wasn't something he could grab, it didn'texist. I remember watching my mum and him arguing about it in the kitchen. It was a long room, the entire width of the house. We had built it with the help of my granddad, Sidney. It was all windows along the entire length, with a long worktop running from one end to the other. \n\nHe had already dismissed the kettle switching itself on at the moment he mentioned making a cup of tea as pure coincidence. As he was continuing to tell us all precisely why it was all bunkum and place his cup down, the saucer beneath it moved slowly out of the way, about 4 inches to the left of him. \"Must be sliding on some spilled water or something.\" He tried again, 3 more times, and each time the saucer moved a little more out of the way. He shouted in a way I had never heard before, nor since, to \"stop f\\*\\*\\*ing me about!\" at which point the saucer accelerated rapidlyand smashed into the cupboard 10 feet away from him, and you know, without breaking a sweat, he calmly looked at the worktop again and said he thought that he must have installed it incorrectly, it must of course be sloping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **A New Job**\n\nMy dad started working nights (great idea by the way, what with the family terrified) and so was either out of the house or asleep when things were going on. I believe I share his unique ability to sleep through just about anything.  \n\n\nIt was as if after the outburst in the kitchen, whatever was stalking us was waiting for him to leave the house. He would leave at 6pm, and by 7pm things were starting up again. Each night it began in small ways. I would be put to bed and shortly begin sweating profusely. The covers were seen to shake, occasionally being aggressively pulled off of me. Sometimes I would not wake during this, even with mum shaking me quite violently, but on those occasions that I did wake up, the events ceased immediately.\n\n  \nIf I was allowed to sleep by the entity, then it was a totally different situation for my mum. Just as she was drifting off a rush of cold air would blow across her face, or whispers directly into her ear. Sometimes the sound of rushing water was so loud and intense it caused her physical discomfort, and the pressure she felt was intense. She had insisted on a dimmer switch in the bedroom as she believed that the entity could only manage the on and off of a normal switch, but that was proved to be wrong very shortly thereafter, and our unwelcome guest had a new toy to play with. In fact there was one very old fashioned light switch in the upstairs landing that it seemed completely unable to operate, and so she would sit at the top of the stairs night after night with the light on, waiting for my dad to get home. Only then did she feel safe enough to return to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Screams**\n\nIt wasn't just my mum getting the worst of the experiences, but she did get more than her fair share. One night she was running a bath, then, suddenly, she was just plain running, straight past everyone and out of the door into the garden with just her dressing gown on.  \n\n\nMum calmed down and came back into the house. She had heard screams coming from the bath water and ran out, leaving the taps running. When we ventured into the bathroom, the taps were closed and the water drained.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, due to my sister and her husband moving back into the house, I was forced to sleep in the one room I hated more than any other, the front master bedroom. Sleep didn't come easily, but when it did, the sweating was once again followed by the sheet pulling. A new and disturbing aspect emerged at this point. I was mumbling and shouting, and incredibly restless. On one night in particular the banging started almost immediately that I fell asleep. It was so loud that mum thought she had to bring me away from it and raced upstairs to get me.  \n\n\nShe grabbed the door handle and twisted, nothing happened, she did not have the strength to open the door. She tried 3 more times before it finally gave way and flung open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was kneeling in front of a full length mirror, staring unblinkingly forward, and talking in a deep voice. She couldn't make out any of the words, but felt the pressure building in the room again. She knew we had to get out of there and now, so she grabbed me and carried me down to the living room. At this point we were alone in the house. Again, whilst I was awake, things were quieter, but as soon as I drifted, the banging began again. It seemed like someone was running up and down the stairs over and over and over again. Our guest it seemed was gathering more and more energy all the time and was becoming increasingly violent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that evening, my sister and her husband returned. It was quiet when they sat down in the living room and mum began to tell them what had been happening. My brother then returned from a night out, and headed to the kitchen with a dose of the munchies. As I drifted off once more began the banging. The door to the living room began to vibrate so violently, they thought it was going to shake loose from the hinges, and all three of them in the living room began to feel the intense pressure building in their ears. Hearing the commotion, my brother ran towards the sliding door separating the kitchen from the rest of the house. Just as he approached, it slid closed immediately in front of him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry as he might, he could not open the door, which also began to violently vibrate. Pain shot up his arm like a burning sensation as he released his grip. My sister was on the floor rocking back and forwards, whilst her husband was shouting and screaming at something he could not hope to threaten. As I woke I wondered why my mum and sister were crying. The kitchen door released and my brother entered the room looking pale. It is the only time I have ever seen fear in his eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n With everyone in the lounge, everyone recounted their accounts of what they had felt and seen. Whilst in the kitchen, my brother admitted that he had never been so terrified in his life. All the electrical appliances were going \"nuts\" as he put it, and the burning sensation felt like an electric shock whenever he tried the door handle.\n\nIt was agreed that something needed to be done and immediately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**School Life**\n\nMy headmaster was worried. I was not doing well, falling asleep in class, and not paying attention. He spoke to my parents and was shocked to say the least at the story that confronted him. Just as shocking was the length of time that it had been going on without help. The family had at this point however decided to get a local priest to come and bless the house.  \n\n\nIn the meantime, one of the masters (posh schools called teachers masters for some reason) who taught mythology and Latin (see, told you it was a posh school) took great interest in my story, and we would often spend time talking about it, which I felt helped me a lot. The problem was, it didn't help anyone back in the house at that moment in time. It got to a point where my mum actually rang the school and asked the headmaster to stop me talking as the banging was horrendous at precisely the same time I was talking about it. He actually claimed to have heard it over the phone. From that moment on it was the new school rule not to talk to me about the haunting, making me feel like a freak and an outcast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Priest Attends**\n\nI was kept home from school that day. I remember watching a cartoon called Dr Snuggles, which with hindsight was a kind of creepy surreal cartoon that probably did nothing for my mental health. The door bell rang, and as mum went to answer, she asked me to shut off the television. I dutifully obliged, but as soon as the priest entered the house it came back on. They entered the room and I was berated for being disrespectful. Whilst not overly religious, we were a God-fearing family and attended the church, albeit somewhat irregularly.  \n\n\nI stood up to turn off the TV. As it turns out, I needn't have done, as it helpfully flicked off itself. I remember the priest saying something along the lines of \"Well, it appears that our visitor isn't afraid of the word of God now is he.\" I didn't know quite what to make of this development, but was sure it wasn't a good thing.  \n\n\nThe priest walked slowly from room to room, sprinkling Holy Water from a small vial, and muttering barely audible prayers under his breath. As he approached the master bedroom in the front of the house, he hesitated, and asked if this was the \"significant\" room. Little did I know that despite his knowledge, he really didn't know what we were dealing with, or how to deal with it.  \n\n\nTwo options were leveled at my mum. Option one was to try to convince me that there was nothing there, and that he had cleared it away. I know now that this was untrue, he knew it remained, but the idea was to remove me as a source of power. If I didn't believe it, it had no power. The 2nd option was to remove me from the house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Change of Scenery**\n\nMy first day of boarding school will be forever burned into my subconscious. I was terrified. It was the same school I had already been attending, but staying away from home at the age of 10 is just not something I think any child is prepared for. Of course, being a social outcast known as ghost boy didn't help matters whatsoever. The feeling of being dumped at the school gates was unbearable. Of course, it was a posh school, people paid thousands of pounds to hide their children away there. What didn't help also was my working class family background. I just didn't belong in their school or social circles, no matter how hard I tried, or how well I proved myself.  \n\n\nFollowing the priest's visit, things had indeed calmed down a lot. Or at least I thought they had, but you see, instead of the open and honest family we had before, we now had a closed and difficult to read dynamic. Things were being kept from me. Whilst it was indeed better, there were still occurrences, I just didn't get to hear about them. The atmosphere was tense in those few weeks after Christmas, as everyone was waiting to see if the entity stopped entirely when I wasn't around any more.\n\n**Nice Plan...**\n\nMy mum recalls the next 2 years as peaceful and quiet. This is selective memory on her part. Precisely five and a half days per week might have been (we had school on a Saturday, what a liberty), but when I returned at the weekend my peace was often disturbed in ways more targeted at me, rather than in connection with me. One example is the nightmares I started suffering at this point. Every weekend when I returned home it was the same dream for 2 nights, and when I returned to school, nothing, nada, zipperooni. This cycle continued for about 6 months that I can recall, accompanied by night terrors. I would wake up screaming at the top of my voice, but nothing came out.  \n\n\nThese dreams always started off the same, in the house, a normal family scene, perhaps eating dinner or watching TV. Then, somehow I would become separated from the rest of the family, and as I looked for them I was stalked, no, hunted would be more apt, through the house becoming more and more terrified until I woke screaming, or not as it happens. I realise that there was some separation anxiety in these dreams, but I still feel like there was something more behind them.  \n\n\nAs the weekends would draw to a close, more little things would occur, like a lightflickering on and off again, the windows also would start playing their little games, and before long, I was being returned to school not on a Monday morning, but on a Sunday night. My parents must have felt that it was simply better for me to be out of harms way so that it couldn't begin to get its teeth stuck in again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Watcher**\n\nSummer hols ahoy !!  \n\n\n8 weeks of no school, it was going to be the BEST 8 weeks of my life. Of course, as I settled back into home life, the smaller events became bigger events, and I really began to disbelieve all that the priest had said. Putting 2 and 2 together, I realised that I was being held at arm's length from the family, and I know now that is was for my own good, as well as theirs.  \n\n\nNo more than a few days into the hols, I woke with such a start I almost flew off the bed. At least I would have done if someone had not been sitting at the end of my bed, on my legs. the top half of me flailed around, I tried to scream but again nothing came out, I was helpless and at the mercy of the shadow at the bottom of my bed.  \n\n\nI could not make out any features, the moon was full and all I could see was the silhouette of a large man. He turned his head from the window he was looking out of and seemed to stare right through me, as if I wasn't even there. I closed my eyes as tight as I could and continued to struggle.  \n\n\nI awoke feeling calm and refreshed. Then it hit me like a 10 pound lump hammer. I casually asked my dad if he had been into my room the night before, of course he had not. I could see fear in his eyes as he asked the question.  \n\n\nI was visited in the night by this shadow person for about 2 weeks as I recall. After the first occasion, the fear left me. He had done nothing wrong after all, he had not harmed me, banged around or made the lights go on and off. He just sat there watching, gazing around the room as if looking for something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A Knock at the Door**\n\nIt was our neighbors. They had news, and thought it may be relevant to our situation. The drowned boys father had died at a relatively young age just over 2 weeks prior, due to cancer.  \n\n\nAs she said the words I wondered if it had been him in my room the past 14 nights. Was he looking for his son? I ran to the back garden to find the old piece of door that we had found scratches on all that time ago. As I looked at the markings it became clear to me that the jumbled up, upside down and back to front letters spelt out a word.  \n\n\nDaddy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A New Begninning**\n\nWe left the house in 1987, having endured the haunting for the best part of a decade on and off. We moved about as far away as we could, my siblings had all left home, and we now lived in a modern 3 bedroom detached house in the country.  \n\n\nI had until this point felt that the events were location-based. That was to change one afternoon as I was walking home with a friend. He was fascinated by the tale of the haunting, and we spoke of it all the way home. Little did I realise that mum was having a hard time again, the kettle and iron were acting up, hot cold, on off, with no intervention on her part. We entered the house, and my friend said something along the lines of \"Hiya Bet, put the kettle on will you.\" The kettle promptly obliged, again with no help from my mum. He ran out the house with a pale face and bloodshot eyes, and would not return for over a week. A few days later, the familiar sound of running up and down the stairs started, but things died down again very quickly, and we soon got on with life as normal.  \n\n\nWe moved again shortly thereafter, to a rented large house further into the country. Again, small things occurred, but nothing of great interest apart from a trapdoor to the loft that would lift out of its recess and rotate by 45 degrees whenever you left the room. On worthy event happened at Christmas dinner 1990. it was witness by my mum, dad, sister, granddad, granny, and Nan. It was the familiar running up and down the stairs, only this time there was no staircase for the noise to be made on, as we were in the single story part of the building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The End?**\n\nI have since grown up, married a fantastic woman, and am starting a family of my own. We have moved house 4 times ourselves in this period of time, and I am sorry to say that we have had thumping up and down the stairs in each property we lived in. Eventually we left the UK, and as we were preparing our journey, I began a recurring dream.\n\nIt was simply a voice, every night for 3 weeks saying \"I will always find you.\" \n\nWe have had events in our current location, including a spontaneous puddle of water appearing on the floor, various noises and the old favourite of running up and down the stairs. The whole family once saw a shadow run across the decking and parking area, but nothing has ever gone to the same level of intensity of my youth.  \n\n\nI often find myself wondering what exactly it was. I am open to ideas and suggestions on this as nothing seemed to add up. Classic poltergeist activity, mixed with classic haunting and a drowned, angry little boy whose father was dieing of cancer at the time of greatest intensity, and the watchful figure, who seemed sad more than anything. Or could it be something altogether more sinister and demonic, merely pretending to be all these things, or using their souls for his own sick enjoyment, whilst making our lives hell.  \n\n\nI have no answers, but I do hope that every one of you enjoyed this journey in some way, I feel I benefitted greatly by finally telling this story, and I thank you all for the opportunity, and for providing me with an audience.",

        "text": "**OREO**\n\nI’ve never owned a cat before. Walking into Marbury Animal Shelter–hoping to find you a forever friend. I didn’t know what cat I’d be choosing that day. My mother mentioned how cats help reduce stress. They are great pets that take care of their basic necessities, granted I’ll still have to feed it and clean up the litter box. That doesn’t bother me, what’s more important is that I find the right cat. \n\nHis paw reached out to me in a gentle manner, his mix of black and white fur coat, a tuxedo cat. Purrs echoed from his cage and his head rubbed against the back of my hand. I petted the soft creature and warmth flourished over me. Our eyes locked, green hazel met my wavy browns and I felt a connection with this furry friend. \n\nOn our way home the car ride was silent besides the deafening hum of the car running. I’ve always thought animals become uneasy during car rides. My childhood friends had pets before and every time their cats or dogs would take a ride to the vet they’d cried out a lot. Yet, that wasn’t the case for Oreo. Despite his timid and anxious state when put into the carrier, he was an angel during our trip home. It wasn’t until we pulled into my driveway that I heard a faint whisper, and then a voice. A deep voice groaned from my new furry friend, “You will die on the third day.” *What the f-*\n\n*Holy crap, am I going crazy?* For the past four hours, every time I’ve tried to get my cat to talk, he’s been saying I’ll die on the third day. I’m freaking out right now and have been shaking since we’ve gotten home. After hearing him speak the first time I had bolted into the house. Dropped his crate on the couch and threw his papers next to my empty bottles of medication. Every time I’ve tried to record Oreo speaking it never shows up on my phone, the audio is silent. I’ve even spoken with my sister and she wasn’t able to hear the eerie voice coming from my new cat. I thought about contacting the animal shelter I adopted Oreo from. Against my better judgment, I decided not to press the dial button on my phone. *They’d think I’m some lunatic if I asked them about that.* Anyways, my sister suggested I take some time to settle in with Oreo and rest, since I’ve been working a lot. *I’m exhausted. There’s no way cats can talk.*\n\n**DAY ONE**\n\nHe spoke…again… “It’s day one, you will die on the third day.” *What’s wrong with me, why does he keep talking?* I woke up to Oreo sleeping at the edge of my bed. Relief washed over me, when I believed it was all in my head. But, now I’m terrified and I’m unsure of what to do. His words startled me and I fell back into a panicked state. \n\nI can protect myself.\n\nIt’s taken the whole day but I think I’ve boarded all my doors and windows. The bright lights in each room illuminated every shadow. *I’m not scared, it’s not true. I’m going to be fine.* My house was secure and nothing could come in. I hoped…\n\n**DAY TWO**\n\nIt’s day two now, and no matter what I do I can’t find Oreo. I hear him but I can’t see him. My phone has gone missing within the wreck I created. I’ve flipped over every piece of furniture trying to search for this dumb cat. My heart beats grow louder with every second and I can hear it in my ears. It’s pulsating, like loud drums. *I need to find this cat. I need to stop this.* My mentally notability is the only thing keeping me sane.\n\n**DAY THREE**\n\nIt’s day three…I’m trapped in my bathroom. Something is after me. I’ve been up for more than 48 hours now. As soon as I was about to doze off an hour ago I saw shadows in the peripherals of my sight. Panicked, I rushed to the kitchen and grabbed a large steak knife locking myself in the bathroom. Had I remembered to replace my light bulb, it wouldn’t have broken and left me in the dark when I rushed in here. \n\nEvery five minutes, large glooming shadows cover the light leaking into the bathroom. The shadows keep lurking underneath the door frame. After a few moments I hear a knock, and then another. *I can fight this thing. Don’t be afraid. Kill the monster.* Stabilizing myself against the bathroom sink I rose tall, knife in hand, doorknob in the other. With a quick twist and pull I plunged the sharp jagged edge into the monster. \n\nThe sound of my knife entering my sister’s heart awoke me. \n\nI held my sister’s limp body, clutching her. My sight was blinded by the tears that flowed. *She’s not supposed to be here. Wha- What is she doing here? What have I done?* Dings chime and I hold onto my sister for as long as I can, ignoring the sounds coming from my sister’s phone.  \n\nWe lay on the floor, my sister sleeping peacefully on my lap. “There there, I’ve got you. You can continue sleeping.” *My sister is tired, she’s been sleeping in my lap for a while now. I wonder where she got all this juice from? Its staining my floor, but it’s okay. I’ll clean it up later.* A ding chimes from her phone. I wrap my damp hands around the case and open her recent messages. *Her last contact was… me…*\n\n**WEDNESDAY 12:55 PM**\n\n“Hey, Mom and I are worried, you haven’t answered your phone and the pharmacist says you haven’t picked up your medications. You know your schizophrenia worsens quickly if you don’t take your medications. Anyways, I’ll be stopping by later this evening, don’t do anything stupid until I get there. &lt;3 Sis.” \n\nMore tears flooded my face, and a cool breeze brushed my cheek. The broken window illuminating the moonlight into my hallway. \"H- Ha- Haha HAHAHA.\" Laughs expel from my exhausted body. *This isn’t real. This isn’t actually happening. It’s all that stupid cat’s fault. He put me in this nightmare. Maybe I can wake up if I-*\n\nI hold the blood-soaked steak knife to my throat, dribbles of red splash my dirty clothes. *I will wake up. When I wake up everything will be fine.* The cold sharp edge meets at the edge of my neck, pressed into the middle. Closing my eyes I sucked in a few deep breaths. As if time slowed by, I heard a faint meow coming from in front of me. My eyes jolted awake and locked with those demonic green hazels. “COME HERE!” I screamed chasing the cat. We ran through each hallway until I finally trapped the bastard into a corner. “I’ve got you now.” I lunged towards the creature and in a split-second it dodged my attack and my head collided with the wall. \n\n**He’s Awake…**\n\nGroaning from a pounding headache, my blurred vision exposed a bright light coming from above me. *Wha- What’s going on.* I hear murmurs surrounding me, whispers echoing behind my ears. I tried to move my legs and arms, tugging at whatever was keeping me stuck but to no avail I lay trapped.\n\n“Oh good, he’s awake.” A deep voice directed to me, “ Mr. James, can you please tell us where you are right now.” \n\n“Uh- I-” I couldn’t see from the bright light. I made out what seemed to be the figure speaking to me.\n\n“I can’t see, I don’t know.”\n\n“Maybe this will help.” The figure loomed over and pushed the light aside.\n\n“NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY FROM ME! YOU KILLED MY SISTER YOU STUPID CAT” I flailed, swaying whatever thing I was strapped to. “I’M GOING TO KILL YOU!” My hands start to loosen from the grasps. Suddenly, heavy hands grabbed my legs and arms holding me down.\n\n“STOP! LET ME GO!” My head whipped back and forth. That cat was keeping me here. Trapped. I saw him. He's pretending to be a doctor.\n\n\"Raymond, administer the tranquilizer,\" A sharp prick prodded into the side of my neck. \"looks like we're going to have to put him back on medicational therapy again. He won't remember a thing. It's for the best.\"\n\n\"No, I wo- w-\" Faint croaks were all I could let out as my vision began to dwindle. \n\n*It's not all in my head. I'm not crazy. I won't let this cat win. I'll… I'l-*",

        "text": "Before we begin, I must warn you. I cannot allow you to read further without having at least tried my best to protect you. Please use any form of anonymity you have - VPN’s, private browsers, hell even airplane mode helps. It might be enough to slow them down. That is all I can wish for. Godspeed.\n\n\nMy name is Jacob Harold Jones. In less than 12 hours of this post going live, I will be killed by the very same government that i’ve dedicated my life to protecting. I cannot protect them any longer. What they have done - what I have done - must be shared. To my family, I am sorry. This is a death sentence for you as well. But in the grand scheme of things, my death, our deaths, are well worth it. My only hope is that what i am about to write lives on. There must be change. Without it, the world is lost.\n\nWithin 12 hours, every mention of my name will be wiped from the planet. My birth certificate will no longer be on file, and my social security number will have never been mine. By the time the sun sets, I will not have existed. I will simply be a shadow in the wind. This is what happens when the full brunt of the United States government falls upon you. People disappear. Strange things happen. You’ve heard of them before - 9/11  is the most well known. People always joke it was an inside job. They have no idea how right they are. In truth, 2976 innocent people died that day. The 19 hijackers were plants, all men that I knew well. They knew what they signed up for. They went through with it, all for the sake of killing one lunatic who knew too much. We figured out that there was a mole who was leaking information to the Chinese. God save my soul, we orchestrated the deadliest terror attack in history simply to get rid of evidence. It brought our country together like never before, united against a common enemy for the first time in 200 years. So we planted Bin Laden. I was likely the only American who mourned his death in 2011. He was a good man, who took the job so the government would take care of his family. He was a friend. \n\n9/11 is perhaps the most public attack my devision is responsible for, but it is certainly far from the deadliest. Thousands upon thousands have died mysterious, necessary deaths, and the blood is on my hands. Heart attacks, strokes, cancers, allergic reactions, peaceful deaths, violent deaths, car crashes, plane crashes, failed safety measures. You would be surprised and horrified at how far modern medicine has actually taken us, and how little you actually know about it. Each and every person reading this has likely passed through a device capable of genetically unravelling your liver and kidneys should you upset the wrong person. They are hidden in airports. They are hidden in grocery stores. They are hidden in home appliances. With a click of a button, I could make nearly 300,000,000 civilian brains combust, in case of emergency. Free will is merely a suggestion. The government owns you.\n\nTechnology is far beyond your comprehension. Whatever you think you know, whatever you think is the most recent innovation has been outdated for the past sixty years. Everything futuristic that you could ever dream of has been created, tested, and perfected, and then put on hold. We have had the ability to convert methane to pure hydrogen for decades, and yet I have sat and watched as our earth has shriveled and rotted with more extreme temperatures and more toxic air. Our oceans acidify and our fish die, while the necessary components for entirely reverting this process sit in a lab somewhere in Wyoming, collecting dust. You can look for them if you want, but you’ll be killed long before you get close. The computers in the reserve of the United States have accurately predicted future events based on algorithms alone, a feat believed to be impossible. True AI has been not only available, but utilized since before the release of the first iPhone. It can tell you more about you than you can about yourself. It knows everything. And it is always learning more.\n\nPrivacy in the United States is a facade. Every word you have ever entered into your computer has been logged, analyzed and stored for further examination if it is found interesting. I type this message in an incredibly secure program, meant to hide from all levels of outside eyes. Today, it is being used for another reason - it is the only way to hide from them. Here I write my confession. \n\nThis is all my doing. Everything. Under sanction of the Federal Government of the United States of America, I have committed thousands of heinous acts. I have killed world leaders. I have caused uprisings and revolutions. I have created famines, floods, and hurricanes. I am singlehandedly responsible for the most amount of human lives lost ever. I wrote the code that birthed the first true AI, which is now so closely intertwined with the internet that without the master key, it would be impossible to remove. \n\nMy team consists of the 6 smartest people to have ever lived. Together, the 6 of us are capable of nearly anything. We have solved some of earth’s largest issues. Intergalactic travel has been conquered. We are not limited to our earth. We are not alone in this universe. We have made contact with alternate life forms. All of our capacity has previously gone to waste. I refuse to let it end that way.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Zeta, a quite literal plan Z. Implemented by me, as a backdoor into every system I have ever created. The minute this post goes live, every search filter, surveillance material, and true AI that the US has will be taken offline. It will cripple them. They will be suddenly eyeless and earless for the first time since world war one. I will also be releasing hundreds of thousands of gigabytes of data. Blueprints for hidden bunkers. Famous assassination plots. Schematics for advances in tech that will lead to a cure to cancer. The new elements that we’ve discovered. Much of this material is unknown to even the president. Use it wisely. Or don’t. I likely won’t be alive long enough for it to matter. \n\nI estimate that it will take approximately 9 hours for them to realize that it was me who blinded them. It will take another few for them to find me. They won’t ask questions. They have enough manpower to fix everything that I have done in mere days. Make the downtime count. \n\nOne further thing. I am sorry. Truly and deeply. If you have read this far, you know too much. You can try to run, but given all that I have said, i’m sure you understand that they will find you relatively quickly. They’ll come for me. They’ll kill me. And then, they’re coming for you\n\nGood luck. May god rest our souls.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. All skin and bone, he was incredibly thin. Sickly and frail, his skin sallow and pale. Everyone prayed for good health and wished he'd get well. But the day would soon come and he would finally die. His parents would wail, they would scream and they'd cry. Without money for the treatments, they could not save his life. And mean old Mr. Morgan, would rather be dead than ever part with a dime..\n\n​\n\nBob Padgett, was a tough cookie. And as far as underpaid clerks go, he was the best at what he did. As much as he hated who he did it for, he really didn't have another option. Work was hard to come by, and steady jobs were nearly impossible to find. He toiled on without a single complaint, counting and recording the miserly scrooge' fortune, all the way to the bank.\n\n​\n\nThe day before Christmas eve, Bob would ask for an advance. Even though he knew the scrooge all too well, and of that there was hardly a chance. Though it *was* nearly Christmas, and had *never* asked before, The scrooge, shot down the question with no more than a grunt and a glance. \"Bah!\", and \"Humbug!\", he exclaimed, as he stared at the flames. The wood in the fireplace it crackled and hissed, and Mr. Morgan grunted out another, \"Hmphf\", yet again.\n\n​\n\nThe shadow that was cast, as he rocked back and forth in his favorite chair, was long and quite wicked, it held on to the chill that hung in the air. But the only monster here, was the one hunched forward and sat in it's chair . I pulled tight the ribbons and closed tight the books, and before we could leave he gave me that look. Again with the scowl, and that subzero glance from just above the rims of his wire-framed spectacles. \"Humbug I say!\", Morgan said, with much more fervor this time, as he began to rise up from his warm oaken throne.\n\n​\n\nHe reached out for the wall, grasping for his coat and scarf from decoratively engraved, wall-mounted hangers. He retrieved his hat from the top of his desk, briskly slapping across the top of it, ridding it of any cumulative dust. His last acquisition before heading for the door, for Mr. Morgan, was his cane. Long, tapered, and black as a moonless night, topped with a decorative silver handle.\n\n​\n\nBy the time Mr. Morgan had made it to the door one elderly step after another. Bob had hurried along and doused the fire, tidied up his work station, and beat him to the door. Holding it open for him, all the Christmas killjoy had to do was step his way through the open doorway, and out onto the snow covered walkway. He held back his tall black hat from being blown free of his frail old head. The bitter Easterly wind blowing hard through the streets kicked up wisps of snow, some gusts even blew themselves up into small dwarf sized little snow devils.\n\n​\n\nBob, pulled the door shut and locked it behind them. He followed after the old man until they reached his flat. A three storied mansion of a flat, empty most times, aside from the old mans shuffling foot falls. It was quite literally just next door. Only a couple shops stood between his business office and the door to his flat. After a couple rejected pleasantries and the slamming of the flat door in his face. Bob only made it a few steps before absolutely falling apart. He broke down and wailed at the walls between buildings like a madman. Pounding on the rust colored brick surface until his hands were all but mashed.\n\n​\n\nHe made it home and inside without stirring any of the children. His wife though she was up waiting for him. With a glint of hope in her eyes, she had been waiting up in the hopes that her husband would come home with great news. At the site of his scabbed over knuckles and bloody fingers, she began to weep falling over into her pillow to hide the sounds of her caterwauling. The sounds of her muffled sobs were replaced by the sounds of rasp, rough, coughing from the room adjacent to their own. In this room, five of their six children slept. And Martha had recently come down with an awful cold and cough. Both of the parents leapt from the room to the sounds. But they did not turn to the left for the room that slept five of their children. They turned to the right, quietly, mother and father peering through the open doorway.\n\n​\n\nThey looked in on the low flames and glowing embers of their next to last fire. They would need to figure out more wood tomorrow, they both thought this at the exact same moment in time. Then they moved their combined gazes to the pallet they had made there just near the fire. Where the warmth and comfort was the greatest they had to offer in the Padgett household. It was the only place in the house you couldn't see your breath. There on the floor laid little Timmy. Tim was a good boy. But having to walk with a crutch most of his young life and being deathly ill half the same, he didn't have a bright disposition. He lay still, breathing softly, but steadily, his face red with fever and his eyelids a hollow purplish color. Covers up to his collarbone and a warm rag on his forehead.\n\n​\n\nMom retrieved the rag without waking him. Probably because he's weak, probably because she had done this a thousand times and by now it was done with the grace of a Samurai Butterfly. She replaced it with another she had waved through the air a few times to cool down. They returned to their room, and within minutes they were both hard asleep. Bob had the most bizarre dream of his life that night, something to do with shadows, and losing something he couldn't find no matter how hard he ever looked.\n\n​\n\nHe awoke with the start of his life too. At first wail he didn't know for sure what t was or what had woke him with such a sudden jolt. But a few seconds later, dear old mom had caught a second breath. And it must of been the deepest she had drawn in her entire life, because the length and pitches of the scream that followed, ripped the heart right out of Bob' chest like a rubber band stretched back a mile and let loose. The way it snapped back in his throat instantly triggered his gag reflex. He vomited next to the bed and jumped to his feet landing in his own mess and slipping to the floor. He looked as his disgusting hands as he got back to his feet.\n\n​\n\nHe knew before he got there, brushing past his two oldest on the way. But the reality didn't hit until his eyes landed on his wife, draped over the dead body of their youngest child. Tim had died in his sleep on Christmas Eve. A few hours later Mr. Morgan sat at his desk, doing his best impressions of a turtle, trying to pull his head and neck down into his shoulders. Just outside the doors, the sound of Bob breaking down through the worst moments he would likely ever live through, struck him over and over again. A half-hearted broken sound followed closely by a thump on the doors or the storefront. And Mr. Morgan knew, their son, \"What was the name?\", he thought to himself, must have finally died. He didn't understand all the fuss though, \"It was an expected death, wasn't it?\", \"He would give Bob the day\", he decided, to grieve if he need, to make preparations.\n\n​\n\nThat night, Morgan would have the worst nightmare of his life. He woke with such a start he thought he may be the next one to earn the undertaker a dime. What was it? Something about shadows? And losing something he would certainly never be able to find. The next thing he was certain of was that he could of sworn he saw something out the corner of his eye. Through the sheer, almost invisible, cloth bug-netting around his bed, he thought he saw something go past his bedchamber door.\n\n​\n\nA shadow..\n\n​\n\nI am the entity. I came in the form of another. There in the doorway stood a monster. It had to be a monster because Tim was dead. Yet there he stood, unmistakably hobbled and leaning on his crutch. No more than darkness in the shape of a young boy, silhouetted in the doorway. And stretched out across the bedchamber floor before him, the shadow. But not the shadow of a boy, it was the shadow of a pointed hulking monster. Black as night and dominating the floor space, the shadow of something horrible. something wrong.\n\n​\n\nThe slamming of the door to Mr. Morgan' bedchamber was heard by the closest neighbors that night. One of them said they thought for sure they had heard a scream in the night, around the same time they had heard the loud crashing sound of a door being splintered on it's frame. The next morning they noticed the police presence.\n\n​\n\nMr. Morgan had been discovered Christmas morning, by his nephew Frederick. He had come to try and convince the old axe to come to Christmas dinner, even though his pleadings fell on deaf ears every year. He still liked to see his grumpy uncle on Christmas, even if he was turning him down on his invitation to dinner every year. His annual visit this year was the surprise of a lifetime. And at the same time, without a doubt the worst thing he would probably ever lay his eyes on.\n\n​\n\nThe sight of Mr. Morgan was abhorred and terrifying. His jaw slung open and distended, open far wider than humanly possible without a complete dislocation of the jaw. His tongue lay out over the side of a cheek, his hands wrenched tight with two fists full of his sleep top. It gave the instant impression that he had been scared to death. Frightened so deeply and so completely that the scream would dislocate his own jaw and his heart would fail. The police captain and the medical examiner would not know what to make of it. The death certificate would read natural causes, a heart attack.\n\n​\n\nI wanted to share one of my favorite stories with all of you. I am the shadow and I am not a man. And sometimes a universal injustice must be undone, or perhaps it was a universal justice be done. Either way I hope you enjoyed the story! Sweet dreams to all and to all a good night..",

        "text": "So, you’re going to be watching my house while I’m away? Good to hear. Here’s some rules you should follow if you want to sur-have a good time.\n\n1. Please turn off the lights when you are leaving. The electricity bill has been absolutely killing me lately and I can’t afford like 12 hours of non stop electricity usage. You know?\n\n2. If the lights turn on or off by themselves, pay no mind, if you pretend like it didn’t happen, you should be perfectly fine, if you accidentally advert your attention, please revert to rule 13.\n\n3. Remember I do not own any dogs or cats. If you hear scratching coming from anywhere in the house, go to the nearest light switch and frantically flip it up and down, a large, roughly 8 foot man, with what appears to have no muscles whatsoever, will appear. As long as you do not interact with it, it should take care of things for you.\n\n4. While using household appliances, please read the manuals on the items, I’d rather not come home to broken appliances.\n\n5. If someone comes by asking if you’ve seen their child, lock all doors and windows, if it finds it’s way in, frantically flip the light switch and the man should go after her, take cover and revert to rule 13.\n\n6. If any lights in my home turn blood red, do NOT flip the lights, if you do, the man will be summoned no matter how many times you flip a switch, if you summon the man during this occurrence, revert to rule 13.\n\n7. Please water my garden every other day, my plants haven’t been doing well.\n\n8. If you see a woman with porcelain skin and long black hair, feel free to chat and compliment her if you’d like, she’s a friend of the man, she comes by to visit him sometimes.\n\n9. If you wake up with a sensation that feels like you’re falling flip your pillow over and go back to sleep, if you forget to flip the pillow and hear screaming, summon the man and revert to rule 13.\n\n10. While opening doors and cabinets, you may occasionally see a blinding orange light emitting from the other side. That is hell, just close and open it again.\n\n11. If you hear what sounds like a relative, cover yourself in peanut butter, it’s allergic, if you’re out of peanut butter, revert to rule 13.\n\n12. No eating between 10 p.m to 7:30 a.m, it’s awake at that time and will become hostile if you do so, the man can’t save you from it. You will perish if you don’t follow this rule.\n\n13. If any situation needs you to follow this rule, find a cross near you, many are placed in my home, if you can’t access a cross, find the fastest way to kill yourself, you will be stuck in an endless loop of torture and death if you’re found alive. \n\nHave a fun time at my house!",

        "text": "Hello, and welcome all. To my shock and still disbelief, we have lived long enough for us to make a part two. Our situation ended with me running Mr Morbid off the road. Now, we’ve been driving for a while and we haven’t seen a sign of him. \n\nHowever, we did have to pull over and take a head count. Me, Emma, Skylar, Giovanni, Tyler, and Michael. We also double checked that the walkies we all had were working. During this time, I read the rules for the van. The rules are as follows:\n\nRule One: If you see Mr Morbid on the side of the road, RUN HIM OVER. Should you miss or notice him too late, refer to rule 3a\n\nRule two: If you hear the radio cutting on and off, turn it off and pop open the engine. Kill whatever is in the engine space.\n\nRule 3: If you see a dark hooded man with a sign, pull over and ask him for directions to Earth. If he says Up, pull out as fast as you can. If you see him again, run him over. If he says down, shoot him in the face. \n\n3a: Should you fail to do this in time, hit the gas and drive as fast and as far as you can. Ignore the figures running next to you. And NEVER answer the shadow figure that will appear in the empty seat. Do your best to ignore him.\n\n4: Never sit in the seat with the blood stains on it. That belongs to Carcass, who is the shadow figured mentioned in rule 3a.\n\n5: If at any point you hear tapping coming from inside the van, stop the van and open the spare tire compartment. If there’s a creature in there, kill it. If there’s a severed hand, RUN back to the drivers seat and FLOOR IT. It has escaped.\n\n6: Once you reach the way back, a rift of light should be visible and the van radio should repeat whatever sentence it had previously been on. If the rift is black but the radio repeats, go around it. If the rift is light but the radio cuts out, DRIVE THE OTHER DIRECTION. \n\n7: If the road starts to turn blood red, then turn around and floor it. If it’s still red within 10 minutes, do not get out of the van for ANY reason. Even if you hear screaming or voices of loved ones, DO NOT.\n\n8: DO NOT STOP AT ANY RESTAURANTS OR GAS STATIONS. Markets are the only safe place.\n\n9: If one of the passengers start talking in the third person, shoot them and dump their body on the side of the road. The real one should appear in a little while.\n\n\nIf these rules didn’t already prove to be real, I would have thrown them out the window myself. But as we were driving and everyone was taking the time to set in our new situation, Gio asked:\n\n“Hey, who’s that guy smiling on the road ahead?”\n\nI looked, and to my dismay, Mr Morbid stood tall with his menacing grin, staring at the van. I immediately turned lanes and ran him over with all the force I could. He flew into a pile of bushes a solid 50 meters away. I drove  away fast and without missing a beat, Michael said:\n\n“WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! You ran over someone!”\n\n“It was Mr Morbid. The rules said to if I see him at any point.”\n\n“Oh shit, the dude from Code Red?” Skylar said.\n\n“Yes. I Saw his jackass outside in the trees out back before we left.”\n\n“Oh, damn. They always said to evacuate but never why. He dangerous or something?” Said Emma\n\n“Genuinely, what do you think? You work a job where your manager is provided a gun with infinite ammo for shooting monsters. Our cash registers are SENTIENT.” \n\nNow, she stared snickering as she took it in. The air started to lift as the gravity of the situation has already set in, since we were making jokes about our impending doom. \n\nWe drove for at least another two hours before the radio started cutting out. I pulled over the van and prepared the hand gun. I popped open the front and a curled up lanky shadow was tinkering with the engine in a fetal position. I grabbed it and threw it out of the engine. It hissed and revealed the most terrifying eyes I have ever seen on a being.\n\nThey were almost placid, but I could FEEL all the anguish and terror behind those vomit yellow eyes. It made me step back in pure fear. It lunges to me, and I shot it in the soldier. It shrieked, and I shot it again in the stomach. It tripped on the road side and fell. It disappeared into the air, as it floated away into ashes. \n\nI hurriedly ran to the van and drove off.\n\n“WHAT WAS THAT?!” Said Gio.\n\nWithout saying a word, I threw the rules manual into the back. \n\n“Read it.”\n\nAfter about two minutes, he said:\n\n“Great, because more damn rules are what we need to survive.” \n\n“Yeah, we kind of do, dumbass. I just shot a shadow creature that struck terror into me with its eyes. Would you have preferred it sabotaged the engine?” \n\n“I… fair.” \n\n“But I get what you’re saying. The bright side is, if the world isn’t on fire when we get back, We get a HUGE government payout.” I said.\n\n“Wait, really?! I can live a comfortable life WITHOUT risking my life slinging burgers?!” Tyler said enthusiastically. \n\n“Maybe. I’ve only heard about it.”\n\n“Still, I’ll hold you to that.”\n\n“I’d expect no less.”\n\nAnother hour passes by, and I eventually see a market. It’s relatively medium sized and has stalled filled to the brim with food. A large red and white sign above it says market. We get out and enter, but it’s been abandoned. Only the products remain. The people seem to have never been here at all.\n\n“Sweet, free food!” Emma says, excited.\n\n“Is it safe to eat?” Asks Skylar.\n\n“The rules seemed to have said so.”\n\n“Okay, I’m not taking that chance.” She said\n\nI walk around for a little while longer and grab some fruit and snacks, seeing as we have no heat to actually make anything. But as I walk towards a stall with chocolates and desserts, I noticed a figure standing by the entrance. A tall, lanky figure, who was smiling a deeply unnatural smile, which curved into his cheeks like it was breaking his jaw. Mr Morbid had returned.\n\nBut this time, he wore a black and white gentlemen’s suit with a brimmed bowlers hat, yet his eyes were still covered by some sort of shadow that was not coming from the bowlers cap. I ducked into the produce building and spoke into the walkie on my shoulder.\n\n“Hide. Mr Morbid is guarding the entrance.”\n\nI’ve been hiding behind a register counter for the past couple of hours. It only now occurred to me that I should update you all. I can hear his sickly and vile voice calling out to us. God only knows what will happen to us. Please, wish us luck. And I’ll hopefully see you all in another update.",

        "text": "PART 1\nWhat’s the worst thing you’ve ever done? Was it horrible? Unspeakable? Straight up Evil maybe? Was it bad enough for you to end up in hell for eternity over? I ponder those questions as I sit here typing away on this keyboard with an uncertain future. I did terrible things in my life sure. But I never really considered myself evil.\nI didn’t remember how I died. And for those of you wondering how I’m on this earth posting this… Well we will get to that. All I remember is waking up in a haze. My senses were groggy. My throat was dry and my eyes hurt. It was dark, almost pitch black, wherever I was. The air was hot and sticky. It reeked of rotten and burning meat. I tried to cry out. But my throat had trouble producing the words. Like I said, my throat was dry. I tried to move but my muscles screamed as I lifted my arms. That was when I realized I’d been chained to the floor. I pulled a little harder. The chains were heavy. But I still managed to move. They made this god awful screech as they were drug across the hard floor. I groaned as I pulled them. The last thing I was expecting, was the voice.\n“Mr. David Stone….” The voice called out. It seemingly came from all directions at once.\n“Wh-Where?”\n“Where you are is not important. Now, listen to my instructions very carefully. I won’t repeat myself. All you need to know is that you exist now as a battery. And I am the one assigned to make sure you stay charged.”\n“What?” I asked.\nA sudden shock of electricity came flooding through me. My muscles tensed as I screamed I’m agony.\n“Don’t interrupt me.” The voice sneered. The voice wasn’t particularly deep or intimidating. It did seem hollow and void of any kind of emotion. I couldn’t tell if it belonged to a male or female.\n“Now, in order for you to stay charged. There are various things I must make you feel. None of them will you find pleasurable. You will cry. You will feel pain like you’ve never felt while you were alive on earth. You will beg me for death. But in the end. Your calls for mercy will fall on deaf ears. There is no mercy down here. Only suffering. Take consolation in the knowledge that your sacrifice, be it deserved or not, will serve to benefit Gehenna and all of its denizens. In the end, your suffering is the most honorable thing your kind will ever accomplish in its entire miserable existence.”\nI sat there silently, my muscles still aching from the electric current that had just torn through me. My eyes still trying to scan the darkness. What was Gehenna? Was I here to be tortured? My mind was having trouble trying to comprehend.\n“I’m sure you have several questions, Mr. Stone. Unfortunately, I run a tight ship and have little time on my hands. So I’ll allow you one.”\nMy mind was still far from being stable. I had so many questions but I just couldn’t bring any to my lips. I strained for a second before I got to my feet.\n“Who are you?” I asked with a horse voice that was almost a whisper. “My name is Saxon. You will address me as Master!”\nThat was when the lights came on. I found myself sitting in a glass box that seemed to float a few feet from the ground. The chains wrapped around me were blacker than black. They were crude in their design. I wondered how they’d managed to get electric currents through it. But I only wondered for a split second as my eyes shot up to the being standing before me. It looked like man, but it was far from human. Its body was human, it was pale, almost paper white. Its head looked like that of an angry lizard. It’s features were reptilian, from the slits where it’s nose should be to the inky black eyes. I could make out a row of sharp serrated looking teeth behind its thin lips. The creature showed no expression towards me. It just stared into my very soul. I froze in fear as we locked eyes.\n“Welcome to Gehenna, Mr. Stone. Or as you humans say, Welcome to Hell!”\nThe next few hours were a blur as I regained my senses. The chains had fallen off. My glass box had been moved into a giant row of glass boxes. Each of them had their own occupant. Most were men from what I could tell. Everyone sat in a corner kind of just staring out into space. I think that was when it actually dawned on me that everyone, including myself, was completely naked. Naked and mostly hairless. I remember running my hand across my now bald head as I turned around. My muscles ached with every movement.\n“It grows back. Then they shave it. Makes us easier to torture.” A voice said from the cell next to me.\n“What?” I asked as my eyes met his. The man in the cell next to mine was a tall, broad, and hairless black guy who had a wide smile across his face.\n“Your hair. For your denizen body.” He said as he pointed to his head. “My denizen what?” I asked. “Your denizen body. At least that’s what the Hellspawn around here call it. It’s the body they assign your soul too when it comes down!”\nI was a bit confused and my face showed it. He only chuckled a bit. “You must be really new here! Tell me, do your muscles hurt? Like when you move?” he asked. I nodded.\n“That’s because you’ve never used them before. Your body was grown in the flesh pits on the second level. When you died, your soul was sent straight there and then assigned a function. I guess you drew the short straw, cause you get to be a battery!”\n“A battery for what?” I asked. The man put his hands up, “All of this! This place feeds off of negative energy.”\nI was still confused as hell. But my brain started to register. I raised a brow at him as I stepped closer to the wall.\n“So I’m dead? And this is hell?” The man nodded. “Do you remember your name yet?” he asked. I thought hard about it. I wasn’t sure about my name. I didn’t even know who I was. “The uhh.. The creature called me David.” I said. “Well… David. My name is Dwayne.” “Like the Rock?” I asked.\n“Rock?” he asked with a confused look. My brain went fuzzy for a second. I’d actually remembered something. “He’s an actor. Big dude, used to be a wrestler!” Dwayne shook his head from side to side. “I’m going to be completely honest with you, David. I was killed in nineteen-seventy-two.” “How?” I asked. “Nam! How’d you die?” he replied. I sighed as I tried to remember. He only took a deep breath.\n“It’ll come back to you.” My thought process, however, was interrupted by a buzzer that rang so loud it made my ears hurt. My hands shot to my ears as I dropped to my knees. My ears were ringing and I could feel blood beginning to gush out. Then, just as fast as it started, it stopped.\n“What was that?” I asked as my eyes tilted over to Dwayne. “Torture time.” The man said as he got back to his feet. “Torture time?” I asked. “Twenty-three hours a day! Used to be longer but the hellspawn all went on strike!”\n“Seriously?” I asked.\nDwayne smirked at me, “No… Rumor has it-“ Dwayne’s speech was interrupted by a sudden spike that shot up from the floor of his cube. It was thin and translucent like the glass that made up the cube itself. It went through the bottom of his foot and through his armpit before exiting the shoulder. Dwayne groaned in pain as his hand shot out and grabbed it. A crimson pool had already started below him.\n“Oh, God!” I said as I tried to keep myself from vomiting. My luck, however, wasn’t any better as a spike came horizontally in my cell. I tried to dodge, I thought maybe I could duck out of the way. But it was a stupid and foolish idea. The spike hit me in the right side of my chest before exploding through my back. Blood splattered all over the back of my cell. I screamed in agony as another spike flew through my back and exploded out of my stomach.\nI could feel the hot tears and blood flowing down my face. The pain was indescribable. I looked over at Dwayne, who winced as another spike came flying through his back and out his front.\nThe last thing I remember was looking at one of the glass walls. It seemed to vibrate at a certain point. Almost like a disturbance in water from a specific angle before a spike came flying directly at my face.\nWhen I woke up. I found myself floating in a pool of a warm sticky fluid. I was still in my glass box though. I groaned as my body went vertical. My feet touched the ground and my eyes shot directly ahead of myself. Where Saxon stood with a disappointed look on his face. “Mr. Stone… You’re not supposed to pass out during your draining sessions. You only lasted twenty seconds. Each session lasts twenty-three hours.” I could feel myself about to say something, but then I remembered the last time I’d spoken out of line.\n“I know you’re new down here. It takes time to adjust.”\nI felt the area on my forehead where the spike had impaled my face. I could hear Saxon exhale at this. “You’re not dead, because your body was grown to regenerate. You can come back from any wound, it helps one last a bit longer during our sessions. The only thing that could really kill your body is one of these,” He said as he held up a obsidian black short sword.\n“A weapon from our armory.”\nI didn’t say anything in response. I just watched the weapon as he moved it around. My mind immediately wondering how I could take it from him and bust out of here. Only problem was, he seemed to notice. My thought process was interrupted by a sudden and abrupt shock that made my muscles clamp up. I roared in pain as I fell underneath the translucent liquid. I had my mouth open, the stuff burned like acid as it went down my throat and into my lungs.\nIt took me a second to come up for air and cough the substance up. I could see Saxon smile at me as he stepped closer to the glass. His sharp and serrated teeth were yellow and blood stained.\n“Insubordination will not be tolerated, Mr Stone.”\nBy now I could feel the anger rising in my gut. I wanted to get out and kill this thing. But I didn’t know how. I could only glare at him through the glass as he turned and walked away. The liquid in my box slowly started to drain. I found myself covered in it. My cell moved itself back into the line of other cells. Where I saw Dwayne trying his best to reattach one of his arms. I inhaled as I watched the veins and muscles seemingly stitch themselves together. It looked disgusting. It also looked painful, Dwayne winced hard as the muscles and sinus reconnected.\n“Don’t worry about him. No one stays conscious the whole day.” He said with a grunt. “What?” “Those that do are taken to another level. Most of them are fucking sadists anyway.” “Where are they taken?” I asked.\nDwayne shrugged. “Never been out of this box! You’re lucky you came on the spike day. Yesterday we were eaten by hellhounds.” My eyes got big as i exhaled. This was the new forever for me. I sat down and leaned my back against the wall. The sticky substance that’d slathered up my body acted as an adhesive. I felt like my back was coated in syrup and I’d laid down against something. I didn’t really care though. My mind thought on Saxon’s sword.\nThat was when another image flashed through my mind. I remembered being on a rooftop. I was surrounded by men in black uniforms that’d all had assault rifles aimed at me. I had my pistol raised at them as well. It was cold outside, quite possibly the middle of winter. To my right stood a priest. I couldn’t tell you his name if I tried. But he was on my side. I had thought we were about to die. I was ready to die right there. But someone saved us. It was a man, a man in a black metallic suit of armor. One who wielded a short sword that was glowing a neon blue color. The man cut through the soldiers like they were made of paper. He saved us.\nMy mind reeled from the memory. I took a deep breath as I looked across my cell at Dwayne. Who sat there watching me. Then I looked at the cell behind me. It was empty, I’d remembered there being a person in there when I’d first been brought in. I turned back to Dwayne with a perplexed look on my face.\n“He’s today’s special battery.” Dwayne said with a sad look in his eye. “What’s that mean?” I asked. “Saxon’s special batteries get to power the appetites of the master himself.” “Appetites?”\nAs of on que, the man was being drug back in by two more larger men. Both of which were wearing thick black collars that seemed to be made of the same metal that had created my shackles from earlier. The glass on the cell slid open and the man was sloppily tossed in. I watched the two burly men as they walked away. They actually wore baggy burlap looking pants. My eyes met one of two’s. The man seemed to immediately look away. Almost like he was afraid.\n“Those are Saxon’s personal slaves. Every once in a while a soul comes through that he takes a liking too.” “Sounds a hell of a lot better then this.” I said. “Believe me… They’re not any better off then we are.” My eyes shifted to the man in the other cell. He was a chubbier man that was also completely hairless like we were. He was curled up in a ball in the center of his cell. I could hear him sobbing. My eyes shifted back to Dwayne.\n“What did you mean by appetites?” I asked. Dwayne took a deep, shaky breath. “It depends on how Saxon is feeling that day. Sometimes he’s hungry…. Sometimes he’s horny… Sometimes he wants to do the torturing himself.”\nI grunted and mumbled under my breath.\n“You were thinking about taking his sword.. He can sense defiance you know! That one behind you, he was a Lawyer in Maryland before he was killed by some drug dealer. I think he abused his wife. Came down here and immediately started making demands. Threatened to sue several times. He was defiant until he became the favorite battery. He’s been the favorite battery since he came here.”\n“When was that?” I asked. “Ten maybe fifteen years ago…. No ones even thought twice about crossing Saxon since. Not that we could if we tried.” I sighed as I leaned my head back and closed my eyes. “I can see the defiance in your eyes David. Do yourself a favor, don’t buy into it.”\nIt was too little, too late however. I’d already made up my mind. I was gonna find a way to kill this Saxon. I didn’t care if it took me a hundred or a thousand years. I could do it. I would do it.",

        "text": "Back when I was in high school in the early 2010s, I bought all of my clothes from Target and JC Penny. My family wasn’t exactly poor, but Macy’s was definitely out of the question. \n\nSince most of the kids in my school were in the same boat, it was basically fine, but it didn’t stop me from lusting after the gowns I saw women wearing at the Oscars and the MTV music awards or whatever.\n\nSometimes, though, I’d go to the mall on the rich side of town and try shit on, just to know what it was like. They had a Nordstrom there, with racks of designer clothes going for two or three grand a pop. I’d try them on and pose for selfies in the dressing room and send them to my friends.\n\nUsually, I wouldn’t dare venture out of the dressing room, but sometimes I’d get bolder and walk around the store, vamping a little bit and taking videos. \n\nThe last time I ever did that was when I walked around a tall rack and bumped into a tall, thin man in a finely-tailored suit. With his high cheekbones and scraggly beard, he looked like he’d walked out of a catalog.\n\n“My apologies,” he said, taking a step back. “You should buy it, by the way. It’s stunning on you.”\n\nI looked down at the gown I’d chosen for the day. It was a sheer and white lace Dolce&amp;Gabbana evening gown that cost $6,050, on sale.\n\n“It’s a little more than I want to spend today,” I said, trying to play coy.\n\nHe laughed, and took my hand.\n\n“Come with me,” he said, walking to the salesclerk. Then he laid a heavy-looking credit card on the table.\n\n“I… can’t,” I said. \n\n“Of course, you can,” he said. “And then you’ll wear it to lunch with me. Fair?”\n\nI felt like I was in a fairy tale. I accepted the offer.\n\nWe are at an upscale steakhouse a block down the street from the mall. I opened the menu to find cuts of wagyu more expensive than my family’s mortgage. I was planning to order a sashimi salad, but when the waiter came, the man ordered for me.\n\n“She’ll have the ribs,” he said. “And please remove her silverware.”\n\nThe waiter obeyed without comment. \n\nA few minutes later, a bottle of wine showed up. I wasn’t sure if I’d remembered him ordering it. He poured me a large glass.\n\n“I trust you’d had a cabernet before?” he asked.\n\nNot knowing what to say, I nodded. In truth, I’d never even tried wine that didn’t come out of a box, and that was only once at my friend Gabriella’s quinceanera. \n\n“The best practice with an older vintage like this would be to decant it for a few hours, but given our limited time, we’ll have to improvise a bit. Here, swirl it like this.”\n\nHe raised his glass to the light and swirled the wine gently. I tried to do the same, but the wine barely moved. I was scared that if I moved it too much, the wine would destroy the terrifyingly expensive gown.\n\n“You’re timid,” he said. “I enjoy that about you. My intention was to agitate the wine, not you. Please go ahead and drink.”\n\nI took a sip, trying to feel sophisticated, but all I could really taste was the alcohol.\n\n“You should be careful,” he said after a minute. “Certain men. Certain evil men would do all kinds of things to a tipsy girl if they got the chance.”\n\nHe stared into his wineglass, still swirling it furiously. Finally, he took a drink. \n\n“Sometimes even good men do the wrong thing,” he added. “I’m sure you know all about that, though. I’m sure the boys in your class have taken their shots.” He took a long breath in and finished his glass. “But you. I can tell you’re a good girl. I bet those boys beg and beg for it, and you just keep telling them no.”\n\n“I think I should go,” I said quietly. “I told my mom I’d–”\n\n“Your mother will be fine,” he said, topping off his glass and adding a splash more to mine. “It would be a shame if you didn’t finish your drink. And your food isn’t even here yet.”\n\nI took another sip as a waiter approached with the plate of ribs. I couldn’t help but notice he hadn’t ordered anything from himself.\n\n“Forgive me, I’m on a diet,” he said. “But please, do go ahead and eat.”\n\n“But how do I…?” I looked down at the plate of ribs, wishing he hadn’t removed my silverware.\n\n“Do be careful not to soil that dress,” he said. Then he took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and passed it to me. “Please, allow me. As a gentleman, I must insist.”\n\nI wondered what might happen if I ran. In my mind, a scenario played out where I sprinted for the door, only for him to catch up to me, pressing me into some dark booth where he rip the dress from my body, forcing himself on me as the waitstaff pretended nothing was happening.\n\n“Eat,” he said, all kindness drained from his voice.\n\n“If I could just…”\n\n“Do remember our agreement,” he said, his eyes boring into me. His gaze warned of consequences.\n\nI picked up a rack of ribs and tore it into pieces as gently as I could, but my hands were a mess. Then I pressed the flesh to my lips and ate. His breathing quickened as he watched me.\n\n“More,” he demanded.\n\nIn life, there are moments when you just say fuck it and do your thing. And this, honestly, was my first Fuck It moment. If he wanted to watch me eat, I decide to let him. And so I did. I ate. Rib after rib. My face and hands got filthy. I sipped wine between bites, choking down the meat until I’d emptied both my plate and my glass. \n\nThen, finally, when everything was gone I stopped and took the napkin, wiping my hands and face. \n\nThe man looked over at me.\n\n“You were incredible,” he said. “A complete surprise. Truly. I’ll never forget you.”\n\nHe reached down and opened his leather satchel, removing a small wooden box.\n\n“The napkin, please,” he said, and I handed it to him.\n\nHe opened the box to reveal a red velvet interior. Then, carefully, like he was handling a work of art at a gallery, he gently took the napkin and placed it inside, before resealing the box carefully.\n\n“Can I go now?” I asked, but he didn’t respond. He just stared at the box, transfixed. I stood and walked slowly out of the restaurant, but when I hit the street, I broke into a run. I didn’t stop until I’d reached my car, tears streaming down my face.\n\nI picked up the phone, thinking I’d call my mom, but instead, I dialed 911. \n\n*What is your emergency?*\n\n“I just got robbed,” I screamed, hysterical. “I just got robbed!”\n\n“Can you please detail what’s been stolen?” asked the operator.\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. “I don’t know.”\n\nAnd I still don’t.",

        "text": " I've never seen a Christmas tree. Not up close, anyway. All those little bells, twinkling lights, and needles of green? Nope. In my family, we do things a little differently. We don't hang stockings, we hang vials of blood. We don't sing and dance, we run and hide. \n\nTradition, amirite?\n\nWell, my parents would hate me doing this, but there are no rules against it, so, here ya go! It's gonna be quite the ride, so I suggest you lock your windows and doors.\n\nThe game starts at midnight of Christmas every Christmas eve. We put away everything we're doing and hang the vials. They're from my siblings, mostly. Every time the dark takes them away, it leaves us a souvenir. A reminder, my dad calls it. Of what? \n\nDon't ask. You still enjoy sleeping at night, right?\n\nAfter we hang the vials, we pray to It until the vials shatter and the lights go out. Then we all run away. We can't talk or communicate with each other. That's cheating, and cheating means punishment. \n\n\"You ready Sammy?\" Dad asked, smiling as he set the bowl of herbs onto the table. It smelled amazing. I nodded, taking my place at the table, and taking a handful for myself. Such was our custom.\n\nMy older sister Maria sat on the right side of the table, while my younger brother John sat opposite to her. Facing me was my father, who smiled and held out his hands. Mother stared at us from the corner of the room, her own lips pressed together, as if holding back tears. She wasn't allowed to play.\n\nAs was custom, we held each other's hands...and prayed.\n\nEvery Christmas, we pray for many things. We pray for my father's good health, so he may continue to serve It. We ask for peace and prosperity to touch my father, so he can take care of us more. To finish it all, we thank It for ensuring our continued survival in this dark world. \n\nI wish I could forget those words. God, I want to forget them, to kick them out of my mind and drive away, into a brighter, better future. But I can't. They were carved into my mind ages ago, like words on unmelting ice. It will never allow me to forget. Never. \n\nThe only lightbulb in the room finally died. The game was on.\n\nI ran outside, fumbling with the backdoor. My hands trembled as I swung it open, my heart stopping as the hinges groaned in agony. I heard It coming. It was searching for me. I didn't stop running until I saw town borders. \n\nI stopped at one of the abandoned buildings, turning back to see the dot among the trees. The dot I called home. I clutched at the knot in my chest, willing my frantic heart to recover faster. It wasn't safe. Not yet. \n\nI slumped against the wall, looking out at the night sky. I couldn't see the dot, but I knew it was there. I needed to stay away. The game would end until the sun rose. Why would the monster bother me now? It had plenty of tasty treats back at the house. \n\nI shuddered, sipping my hot water as I looked out into the shadows below. My flashlight was at my feet, ready to turn on at a moment's notice. I knew the batteries were almost dead though. If they weren't, I'd have already switched it on five times to convince myself I wasn't being watched. \n\nThe hairs on my back began to rise. Something felt wrong. Very wrong. I got up, grabbed the flashlight and looked around. I realized just how isolated this place was, with its snowstorms and ice-filled roads. In this wintery wasteland, who would hear me scream?\n\nI don't have the courage to describe what I saw in that room. I barely remember it. Fragments of a dream at this point. Or nightmare. Nightmare's probably more accurate. I remember...eyes. And teeth. Lots of gnashing teeth. They were chewing on something. \n\nI didn't stick around to see what it was. I just ran. My heart pounded; I moved faster than I ever thought possible. Faster than my legs had ever carried me before. All around me, the sounds of gnashing teeth and desperate wails melded with one word.\n\n\"Jackie!\"\n\n\"Jackie!\"\n\n\"Jackie!\"\n\n\"Come here Jackie!\"\n\nLike a predator watching its prey, reveling in its fear. Sharpening its knife while its victim squawked and flew around like a headless chicken. The chicken in question, being me. That was *my* name...and it was coming from something that I don't think was ever meant to exist. \n\nThe sky was as black as the shadows surrounding me. My flashlight quivered in my hand as I ran. Left, right, left. All the way back to my house. I navigated the warped trees, barely avoided the lower branches as I sprinted through the darkness. \n\nThe voice continued to follow me, running so fast I feared it would catch up any second. If it caught me, what would happen? Three of my six siblings had already been lost. What'd happened to them? \n\nAn axe flew over my head, burying itself in a tree trunk. I knew that axe. Whose axe was that? Why did I remember it? Its handle was tipped with some kind of stone; a gemstone? Rubies, maybe? But why-\n\nI felt It's hands grab my forearm. I screamed, taking my head as far back as I could until I hit It. It roared in rage, letting go of me long enough to mount an escape back to the house. The sun was rising. I was safe!\n\nI ran through the back-door, slamming it shut just as the creature ran into it. Splinters fell onto the ground, but the door stood firm. I collapsed onto the floor, and that was it. \n\nDad shouted at me for hours, nursing a bloody nose as he sent me to my room. I wasn't supposed to go outside. It was so unfair, but I knew better than to complain about fairness to my father. His word was everything. He was the one who decided what was fair. \n\nSo, here I am, finishing up this story. Dad's been going away for a long time. Every time he goes away he brings back more meat. He says he's been asking It for more food, but that It's displeased. Because of me. \n\nDad's been going on a lot of road-trips to get more meat. Each time is longer than the last. But he says it'll be better. Christmas is coming up soon, and it will be our only chance to please It enough to ask It for food and aid again. \n\nI know that we need to make It happy again if we want to survive this winter. \n\nI'm just not sure I want to know how. ",

I was hitchhiking, and they’d stopped, it was as easy as that. I needed to get somewhere more civilized, and the company of a man and his son was probably better than to stay out in the middle of nowhere. The car itself was an older icy blue Volvo-model; one of those cars with a box-like shape. That thing had probably been around longer than I had.\n\nThe man had this long horse-like face with sunken eyes. A kind of chronically tired-looking man with a hawk-like nose and a tube-shaped torso. The kid sitting next to him, on the other hand, barely looked related. He was maybe eight years old, with short black hair and deep, dark eyes. Pale as an egg.\n\n“Evening,” I said. “You’re, uh… you’re not heading anywhere Tomskog, are you?”\n\n“Tomskog?” the man said. “Never heard of it.”\n\n“I’ve been there,” said the kid. “That’s far.”\n\n“Oh, so we’re… this isn’t Minnesota?”\n\n“Son, are you lost?” the man asked.\n\n“Definitely,” I chuckled. “Absolutely.”\n\n“Sit down for a bit, we’ll figure it out.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got in the car as it idled by the roadside. There was this stale smell of pine and cigarettes that puffed up from the cheap nylon seats. The man in the driver’s seat turned to me. Without the lights from the dashboard it was surprisingly dark. I struggled to see the details of his face.\n\n“I’m Alan,” he said. “This is Fred.”\n\nThe kid turned around and flashed a big grin. He didn’t seem to blink much.\n\n“Hi,” Fred said. “We’re on a big trip!”\n\n“A little father-son bonding time?” I smiled.\n\n“He’s not my son,” said Alan, completely stone-faced.\n\nA cold silence sunk over me as I realized this was something else entirely. And whatever it was, I didn’t want to be a part of it. I put my hand on the door, ready to get out.\n\n“Son, do you know where you are?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I thought about it, I had no idea. I didn’t recognize the area, and the air felt a bit different. Then again, it was too dark to see anything properly. Running into the wild here might be a stupid idea; especially in the dark. Then again, I didn’t want to take my chances with ‘Alan’ and ‘Fred’. \n\n“You’re in Arizona,” said Alan. “About six miles from Phoenix.”\n\n“Phoenix?!”\n\nMy mind was spinning. How the hell I ended up in another town, let alone another state, was beyond me. Maybe the woman in the blue kaftan had messed me up more than I realized.\n\n“What, uh… what date is it?”\n\n“It’s the 21st,” said Alan. “June. Well, 22nd now, it’s just past midnight.”\n\nI hadn’t kept a sharp eye on the date while I stayed in Saint Gall, but I knew for a fact that it hadn’t passed the 15th. I had lost at least seven days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sunk my face into my hands, trying to figure out what to do. But first things first; I had to get out of the car. I couldn’t stay with these people. There was something fundamentally wrong with them, and I wasn’t eager to find out what it was. If this whole ordeal had taught me anything, it was to trust my instincts.\n\n“We’re heading up to Denver,” said Alan. “You’re welcome to tag along.”\n\n“That’s alright, I just needed to-“\n\n“I think you should come along,” said Fred. “We could play games.”\n\n“No need to, I-“\n\n“We’ll just drop you off at the next stop then,” smiled Alan and started the car. “There’s a gas station up ahead, I’m sure you can make your way from there.”\n\nI quietly tugged on the door handle, only to notice the child locks were engaged. Unless I wanted to ask them to open, I was stuck.\n\n“That’ll be fine,” I said. “I’ll get off there.”\n\n“Sure thing.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we drove north, I got a good look at the two of them. Alan was barely keeping it together. I could see his hands shaking, and he couldn’t keep his head straight. He kept moving, like a bobblehead. His short brown hair was in disarray, and I could see sweat stains on his shirt. He was in a rough shape. Fred, on the other hand, was completely fine. He sat up straight and seemed attentive. If anything, he seemed unusually energetic for a kid. Excited, even.\n\nIt took us about twenty minutes before we got to the gas station. This single building lit up the night, drawing us in like a lighthouse. I could see a young man playing something on his phone inside.\n\nAs we pulled in and parked next to the gas pumps, Fred turned to me.\n\n“Thanks for the ride, I appreciate it,” I said. “Good luck on your trip.”\n\n“You’re not coming with us?” asked Fred.\n\n“I don’t think so. I’m going straight back to, uh, Minnesota.”\n\n“We might go there next,” said Fred. “You could come with us.”\n\n“That’s alright, I’m good,” I said. “Take care.”\n\nAlan disengaged the child locks, and I hurried out of the car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see them looking at me from afar as I went inside the gas station. The light felt soothing after being in the dark for so long. The attendant perked up and put away his phone. He waved at me, and I waved back.\n\nI was coming to the realization that I was probably running on adrenaline, and needed something to eat. I asked for two hot dogs and a coke. Paying for it quickly turned into a problem though, as all my credit cards were declined. Seems my family had pulled the last plug on our relationship.\n\nI stood there fumbling around my pockets for a while when I heard the door ring.\n\nIt was Fred. Alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe walked up next to me, looking at me with those dark unblinking eyes. He couldn’t stop smiling. Strangely enough, this was the first time I noticed he wasn’t wearing shoes.\n\n“You want a hot dog?” he asked. “I’m hungry.”\n\n“Sorry, I, uh… I can’t pay for these.”\n\nThe attendant sighed and put away the tongs; clicking them twice for good measure. Fred didn’t stop smiling.\n\n“That’s okay,” Fred said. “I don’t really like hot dogs anyway.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a loud bang, catching me off guard as the building went black. Some kind of circuit had fried, but not even battery-powered devices seemed to function. I could see the attendant’s phone go dark.\n\n“I just drink the ketchup anyway,” laughed Fred, somewhere in the dark.\n\nI just saw his outline, but he was quick. There was a little pitter-patter of feet and giggles as he ran off somewhere into the back. The attendant didn’t seem to know what to do; he just froze.\n\n“Hold on, uh, I think there’s a- no, wait…”\n\nWe were both fumbling in the dark. I could hear him move across the counter, knocking over a display. Little plastic toys scattered across the floor. \n\nI headed for the door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe power seemed to be out, and I couldn’t find the manual lock for the doors. I looked for a latch, but it was impossible in the dark.\n\n“Excuse me, how do I-“\n\nI heard the attendant fall over with a painful thud. Then, he got eerily quiet. There was just this quiet gulping sound, like someone sucking liquid off the floor.\n\n“Hello?” I asked. “What, uh… are you there?”\n\nI moved around the counter and saw something looking back at me. Reflective eyes, like that of a cat. They didn’t blink, as they slowly bobbed back and forth. Drinking something off the floor.\n\nThe attendant didn’t respond.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran back to the doors and forced my fingers in. I could tell I was weakened, but I was still strong enough to pry myself through the doors.\n\n“You can still get a hot dog!” laughed Fred. “They’re free now!”\n\nI could hear little pitter-patter of naked feet getting closer as I forced myself through the doors. They slid shut behind me. Looking back, I could see Fred pressed against the glass. Hands covered in blood, with a big grin on his face. His eyes seemed larger, and even darker. But in the right light, they reflected at me.\n\n“I’ll wash my hands!” he said. “Wait there, I’ll get you one!”\n\nNo way. I turned to run, only to hear the clicking sound of a loaded gun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlan was standing ten feet away with a handgun aimed at me. He yawned, and I was afraid his shaking hands might accidentally pull the trigger. I noticed how even the streetlights had gone dark outside. I could make a run for it, if only I could work up the courage.\n\n“Calm down,” Alan said. “We’re still heading for Denver, son. You sure you’re not coming along?”\n\n“I-I’m… I’m sure.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” said Alan. “Fred seemed to take a real liking to you, and he’d love the company.”\n\n“Would you accept no for an answer?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I wouldn’t.”\n\nI hadn’t even noticed Fred getting through the doors. He was standing right behind me, near enough to grab my arm. I considered picking him up and using him as a shield, but I got the sense that it would be the end of me. This was no ordinary kid, and this was no ordinary man.\n\nFred held up a hotdog drenched in ketchup.\n\n“I got you this.”\n\n“T-thanks,” I said. “I’m not hungry though.”\n\n“Maybe just eat the fucking hot dog,” said Fred, his smile fading.\n\nSo I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey lead me back to the car, this time putting me in the driver’s seat. I noticed they’d made a few modifications. They’d removed the seat belt from the driver’s side, and the lock was disengaged by the passenger; not the driver. Fred had been the one in control all along.\n\nAlan curled up in the back seat, falling asleep instantly. Fred dumped a bag of snacks and drinks in the back seat, then got back up and sat down next to me. For a moment, I thought about just beating the kid up and getting out. I thought about it. Alan was already out cold, and this kid didn’t have a gun aimed at me. So what was stopping me?\n\nWell, those eyes for one. Those cat-like eyes, and that big playful grin. This kid was waiting for me to do something. To slip up. To try.\n\n“We’re going to Denver,” said Fred. “And you’re driving.”\n\n“You’re… you’re kidnapping me?”\n\n“I’m taking you home.”\n\n“What do you-“\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFred slammed his little hands on the dashboard, causing Alan to explode into action. Shaking hands grabbed me and pulled me back in my seat. Fred’s eyes lost their reflective sheen as his posture changed. Something about his voice shifted.\n\n“You are wasting my time,” Fred said. “I have no interest in killing you. I’m taking you home.”\n\nDespite what he was saying, I couldn’t help but feel that this was gonna be a living hell. There was something in the way he looked at me that just made my blood freeze. Like I was expecting a sudden punch to the gut that never came.\n\n“We’re not here for a joyride. We’re taking you home.”\n\n“H-how?” I asked. “How did you know where to find me?”\n\nFred leaned back in his seat as Alan relaxed. No more than five seconds later, he was out like a light. Fred just stared straight ahead and lowered his voice.\n\n“Our dads went to school together,” said Fred. “And I was asked to take you home. So I’m taking you home.”\n\n“I can just… take a bus,” I said. “You don’t have to trouble yourselves.”\n\n“It’s no trouble,” grinned Fred. “In fact, you’ll be very helpful.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got back on the road, following the I-70 north. The plan was to go through Utah, then east to Denver. Fred knew the way by heart without relying on GPS or anything electronic. That the car worked at all seemed like nothing short of a miracle; everything electric seemed to die when Fred got upset. Or maybe it was some sort of targeted effort on his behalf.\n\nI asked him to explain what he meant by our dads going to school together. Apparently our dads had been in the class of 2000, along with a cast of other strange students. The one thing I couldn’t wrap my head around was the timeline. It sounded like Fred was born around the same time as I was. Maybe earlier.\n\nIt didn’t make any sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI drove all through the night, stopping at random intervals for Fred to get out and check something. He’d step out of the car and just smell the air, like he was looking for a scent. I thought about just taking off, but Alan would probably shoot me long before I got the car running.\n\nFred would fall in and out of this sort of boyish character. In one moment he’d play sweet and innocent, and the next he’d talk like a fully-grown adult. He’d relax his demeanor and put his feet up on the dashboard.\n\nWe got off the highway after about an hour, instead taking back roads through smaller communities going north. Sometimes Fred would catch a scent, and we’d switch course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout an hour before the break of dawn, Alan woke up. He had this blaring alarm going off, and he shot up like a bat out of hell. We pulled over, and I was asked to step out of the car. For a moment, the three of us just stood there on a back road in rural Utah.\n\n“Look,” said Fred. “We’ll get you home. But until we do, you’re mine. Consider it payment.”\n\n“For what?”\n\nAlan smacked me in the back of the head just hard enough to knock the wind out of me.\n\n“Show some damn respect!” he snarled. “We could’ve left you to be torn apart!”\n\n“Now now, dear Alan, no need to get nasty,” smiled Fred. “I’m sure we can make all of this… mutually beneficent.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlan opened the trunk, and Fred crawled in. The trunk was lined with felt and plastic, and it had this soft smell; similar to a mild lilac perfume. Alan shut it, leaving the two of us alone.\n\n“All you have to do is drive,” said Alan. “To drive, and not to drive. I’ll tell you when to do what.”\n\nI was allowed to rest in the back seat for a while when necessary, but only while wearing handcuffs. It seemed that Alan wasn’t the trusting kind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe kept going north. Around 9 am, I asked if I could take a rest. Alan was fine with it, as long as I wore the handcuffs. I crawled into the back seat, put the cuffs on, and did my best to make myself comfortable. After a few hours of silence, drifting in and out of a restless sleep, I tried to make a bit of small talk.\n\n“So why are you doing this?” I asked. “Is it because of my dad?”\n\n“In a way,” nodded Alan, waiting to take a left turn. “And because of John.”\n\n“John? John Digman?”\n\n“That’s the one.”\n\nAlan was trying to navigate a series of small roads, passing by dozens of identical warehouses. He was having trouble finding the right exit.\n\n“Fredric has worked with John in the past,” Alan added. “I thought that was obvious.”\n\n“Obvious how?”\n\n“Well,” chuckled Alan. “Lights don’t just turn themselves off, do they?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I slept through the day, I kept having these weird dreams. They’d be normal at first, but at some point I started noticing that Fred was in them. And not like, someone I was actively dreaming of, it was as if he was standing beside me; looking at my dreams and judging me from afar. It was so lifelike and distracting that I started to wake up after noticing him. But after a dozen or so times, I just stopped caring. He was simply there, no matter what I did.\n\nAfter a few hours of sleep, I started to expect Fred to be there. It felt stranger *not* to have him there. I started to look for him, and I felt anxious when I couldn’t see him. He *was* there. He *had* to be there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finally woke up, it was already dark. I must’ve been out for at least 10 hours. I was having cold sweats. I didn’t even think; I just got out of the car. I found myself relieved to see that Fred was up.\n\nAnd *that* frightened me. I wasn’t supposed to feel relieved. There was something fundamentally wrong with this kid. Didn’t he kill someone that previous night?\n\nStill, I couldn’t help it. I felt safe knowing he was awake and watching. So when I was asked to get in the driver’s seat, I didn’t protest. But seeing my hands shaking as I placed them on the steering wheel sent a cold shiver up my spine.\n\nWas this what had happened to Alan?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next few days, we drove all around the state; stopping only for a quick bite to eat or a bathroom break. I would mostly stay in the driver’s seat, except for the hours where I slept in the back. During those hours, I could feel myself finally relaxing. The deepest, most serene sleep you can imagine. While awake I’d feel myself stressing out over anything and everything, unless Fred was in the car next to me. I’d see awful things at the side of the road. I imagined vaguely humanoid shapes coming out of the forests, or seeing faces leap out in the dark. Sometimes I’d see something in passing cars, like a driver without a head, or no driver at all. It was only during those first few hours after a long sleep that I functioned as a normal human being. Better, in fact.\n\nDuring the hours where it was just me and Fred, he’d sometimes have me stop at strange places. I’d wait outside apartment complexes or stop at dark roads in the middle of nowhere. Those few moments when I was left alone were absolutely terrifying. I’d hear strange noises in the wind, or hear whispers coming from the trees. I’d imagine something trying to sneak up on me, or see shadows grow longer. It wasn’t until Fred came back that it all disappeared.\n\nNow, I’m not stupid. I know I was being manipulated. But when I was stuck in the middle of it, I didn’t care. I just felt like this was the way things were supposed to be, and I did what I had to do. After all, Fred was taking me back to Minnesota.\n\nRight?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe continued through Denver down to Albuquerque. From there, it was a straight shot to Dallas, and then eastwards to Jackson. All the while taking side roads and avoiding heavy day traffic. Alan and I would take turns driving and watching Fred while he slept in the trunk.\n\nDays turned into weeks. We drove from Jackson to Indianapolis, stopping only to sleep, eat, and have the occasional sponge bath in a restroom. I didn’t even question it, but I noticed I was growing more and more tired. I required more sleep, and it was getting harder to wake up. I could easily get up to 12 hours of sleep every day, and I wouldn’t wake up until someone literally shook me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember one night as Alan was resting in the back seat. Fred had stepped out for some nefarious purpose, leaving me alone in the car with nothing but the horrors outside to keep me in check. I imagined something coming down the road, looking for me. Something staring at me from behind the trees.\n\nThen, I heard a thud.\n\nI looked back, only to see that Alan had dropped his gun. It was just lying there. Carefully, I picked it up and examined it; hoping he wouldn’t spring to life anytime soon. The gun was loaded.\n\nMy mind was racing. I could take off running, and no one would stop me. I could get out. I could go to a police station and call for help. Even the horrors outside seemed a little less threatening now that I had a weapon. I could do something. *Anything*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You mind giving me that?”\n\nI hadn’t even noticed Fred coming back. His mouth was covered in blood, and those reflective eyes held me hostage. I could feel this intense threat emanating from him, like a feral cat waiting for an excuse to tear my throat out.\n\n“No,” I said. “Stay right where you are.”\n\n“Maybe you should rest for a while,” said Fred. “I’m sure you’ll feel better in the morning.”\n\n“What… what the fuck are you doing to me?”\n\n“I’m taking you home. Isn’t that what you want?”\n\n“We’re… we’re nowhere near home,” I said. “And I don’t trust you.”\n\n“You don’t trust me?” Fred pouted. “Fine. Hand me the gun.”\n\nAnd I did. It wasn’t even a conscious choice, it just happened. No more gun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, someone was dragging me out of the driver’s seat. Alan had woken up, and he was pissed. He tripped me and started kicking me, over and over, while Fred watched. I couldn’t help but to curse myself for being such a blatant idiot. I’d had the chance, but I didn’t take it. I’d handed over the key to my lock.\n\nAlan just kept screaming and kicking me, while Fred giggled. I just coughed and groaned, trying to protect my face. Once the beating stopped, Alan dragged me to the back of the car and locked me in the trunk.\n\n“You… you don’t do that!” Alan cried. “You don’t point that thing at him!”\n\nAs I lay there, trying to catch my breath, I heard Fred’s voice come through.\n\n“You’re right, you know,” he chuckled. “I’m not taking you home anymore.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that point on, I wasn’t allowed to drive. The nightmares got more intense. The visions as well. It was as if Fred had gone from subconsciously messing with me to outright torment. I’d spend every moment of my dream looking for him. Waking or sleeping, I’d have no peace unless he was near. There was nothing that could protect me but him, and he was trying to fixate my mind on that singular fact.\n\nI tried to fight it. I tried. I really did. But I just kept falling back into surrender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was probably mid-July. I was sitting in the back seat, handcuffed. Alan was driving down a long country road. I didn’t have the slightest idea where we were, and what we were even doing there.\n\n“Pull over,” said Fred. “I’m hungry.”\n\nAlan stopped. We both watched Fred get out of the car and walk into the night. For a moment, we just sat there in silence as Fred walked off. Then, Alan turned to me; his eyes wild.\n\n“K-keys,” he said. “They’re… they’re under the mat.”\n\n“What?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlan stepped on the gas. Tires screeched and spun as we swayed back and forth. The tires found their footing, and we sped down the dark country road, going full speed ahead into nothingness.\n\nI fumbled around and found the handcuff keys hidden away. I had to turn the key with my mouth, but the handcuffs finally slipped off.\n\nThe road was horrible. The further we went, the more terrifying it got. It was like falling into a hell hole; countless images of gore and death following us and appearing out of nowhere. And for a moment, I realized that this was what Alan was seeing as well. Without Fred around, we were both hopelessly terrified beyond an ability to function.\n\nAnd still, he stepped on the gas.\n\n“I-It’s not real!” he kept screaming. “It’s not real!”\n\nOver and over and over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe barely managed to keep the car on the road. This was it; we were making a break for it. Maybe he was just as much a victim as I was?\n\n“I-I’m taking you home!” said Alan. “I don’t care wh-what he says, you’re going home! It’s the right thing! It’s right!”\n\nA sign passed us by as we screamed down the road.\n\nWelcome to Minnesota.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out, Alan had planned this for a while. Fred rarely paid attention to road signs, so Alan had just kept slowly taking back roads further and further north. We’d just crossed into Minnesota, which was what he’d waited for. We couldn’t escape while Fred slept, it seemed, as that was the one point of the day where his control was the strongest. During those hours we were both just mindless drones.\n\n“When you get out, promise me to… to just go!” Alan screamed. “Promise me!”\n\n“I promise!” I said. “Eyes on the road! Eyes on the road!”\n\nHorrors from all sides. Whispers telling me about the delicious juiciness of my innards. Clouds shaped like behemoths, ready to come down and crush me to pieces.\n\nAnd yet, Alan just stepped on the gas. Horrors aside, we had to trust that none of it was real. We just had to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t know how long we’d driven before Alan started to slow down. He’d look over at me every now and then just to make sure I was still ‘me’, and not turned into something unimaginable.\n\n“I thought you’d be like him,” Alan cried. “He said your dads had… something. In common.”\n\n“It doesn’t make any sense,” I said. “He’s just a kid.”\n\n“He’s not,” Alan sighed. “He’s really not. It’s just that… that shit in him.”\n\n“What are you talking about?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlan stepped on the brakes. Once the car came to a halt, he looked at me.\n\n“Fred had a younger sister once, but… she died. She was just four years old.”\n\n“That’s awful.”\n\n“When that happened, the parents… they needed some kind of… of *reassurance* that they weren’t going to lose another kid. A promise. A wish.”\n\nI got a sinking feeling in my stomach.\n\n“A wish,” I repeated. “You don’t mean…“\n\n“The Yearwalk,” said Alan. “That’s what the two of you have in common. Both your dads did it, together.”\n\n“But his dad made it.”\n\n“Yeah,” nodded Alan. “And whatever he wished for made Fred into… this.”\n\n“That’s why he isn’t trying to kill me. He already got a wish fulfilled.”\n\n“He’s happy just the way he is”, sighed Alan. “That’s why he’s always smiling.”\n\nAlan stepped on the gas, as we sped into the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe kept going for a few hours. We passed Blue Earth and Fairmont, and as we started closing in on Tomskog, the roads seemed to get darker. The visions were still there, but we were seeing past them. Both Alan and I were having cold sweats and shivers, both from stress and fear, but also just… being on our own. We were breaking a bad habit.\n\nAs Alan took a sharp right turn towards Tomskog, the pale headlights of the car suddenly went out.\n\nWe didn’t know what was going on. Alan sped up, even as I screamed at him to stop.\n\n“We can’t stop now!” he screamed back. “We can’t-“\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI coughed, tasting metal on my breath. The seat belt had held. Not so much for Alan, who was nowhere to be seen. The windshield was ripped apart, and a noxious fume was spewing into the air.\n\nI was probably concussed, maybe worse. I couldn’t get my hand to move straight. There was this mechanical thunking noise as the engine died. I finally got the seat belt off as I fell out of my seat, and into a ditch.\n\nA snapping twig caught my attention as my head swiveled around.\n\nFred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe grabbed my shirt and threw me down with the same ease as folding a paper napkin. His smile faded into a vicious grin, showing row after row of shark-like teeth. There was no ceremony, no pomp or frill. He was just going to fucking eat me.\n\nI shielded myself as a bang went off.\n\nAlan’s gun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“A moment,” Fred laughed.\n\nThe moment he let go of me, I ran. I’d promised Alan I would. Fred seemed frustrated, but he was more annoyed at the various bullet holes that started to riddle his body. Shot after shot, muzzle flashes lighting up the night. As the final shot rang out, there was an awful shriek; ending with a rubber-like snap.\n\nI looked back one final time.\n\n“*Told you I’d get you home!*” Fred laughed. “*You’re welcome!*”\n\nA hysterical laughter echoed as I watched Fred drink the blood from Alan’s disembodied head.",

        "text": "I used to live by a cemetery, I could see it from my bedroom window.\n\nSome nights I would look out at it in boredom, willing in my mind for something to happen, something other worldly to appear.\n\n\nNothing ever happened, of course, it remained dark and empty. No zombies or ghosts ever appeared, but it was a game I played with myself. Stupid but fun.\n\nThat night was different, though that was the night everything changed.\n\nAs the years went by and I grew older, my fascination with the cemetery waned as childhood curiosities do.\n\nFor whatever reason, though, as I was getting ready for bed, something drew me to the window. When I looked at the cemetery, I saw that there was a light emanating from the ground, at the center of the headstones.\n\nI tried to figure out where it was coming from, a car, a flashlight, maybe somebody had lit a candle?\n\nI dismissed every explanation and decided to go and find out what the light was. In all the years I lived there, I had never seen anybody on its grounds. The headstones were so old that they jutted from the earth crooked and yellow, they looked like they would crumble if you touched them.\n\nThe moon was huge, there were no stars, and the air was crisp and sweet. It was unpleasantly cloying, like fruit gone bad.\n\nIt had rained earlier in the day, and mud squished beneath my feet. My heart thumped in my chest painfully, and anticipation rushed through my veins.\n\nThere is something serene about being in a cemetery at night. I have been here dozens of times and never found it scary. This night felt different, though. I felt different.\n\nIt was as though this was the moment in my life that I had been waiting for. \n\nThe light was brighter, and there were more of them. They weren’t coming from the ground as I thought, but rather from each headstone. \n\nThe epitaph’s glowed as white as angel wings. I read the one nearest to me, and it said:\n\nBaby\n0000 - 0000\n\n\nUnderneath it, in red paint, was a crude drawing of a stork with a distended stomach.\n\nI frowned. I had never seen this one before, and it’s not as though you would forget a thing like that. \n\nI checked the one closest to it, and it was the same date. The name read child, and there was a face with x’s for eyes drawn on the bottom, its mouth a shaky uneven line.\n\nMy heart was beating even faster, and my mouth had gone bone dry. I watched as the words on the stone grew darker until they bled a crimson red. \n\nI made to run, and that’s when I saw her. She had been crouching by the furthest grave hidden by the veil of the night, watching me from afar.\n\nShe stood and I screamed. She was very tall and very thin. Her skin was the color of fresh paper, and her hair was wild and white like fsnow. Her fingers were hooked into claws, and she limped towards me, slow but determined. \n\nI was frozen in place, I forgot how to breathe, and as she came closer and closer to me, I saw how wide her mouth was, and god she had so many teeth.\n\n She had row after row of teeth, and they were all sharp and glistening wet with blood. \n\nI don’t know how she could see me, because she had no eyes. There were only empty black sockets, half full with dirt.\n\nMy paralysis broke, and I turned and ran. I ran out of the cemetery and into my house. I didn’t stop running until I reached my bedroom. \n\nMy blinds were still open, but there was no way I would close them tonight. I could feel her underneath my window, staring up at me with those horribly empty eyes.\n\nI don’t remember falling asleep, but the sun woke me up. It was so bright outside that I felt like crying in relief, and I rushed to close the blinds.\n\nI can’t lie, I did look and I saw nothing.\n\nThe cemetery was as it always looked. Empty, peaceful.\n\nFrom then on, I never looked out my window at night. I kept my window closed and brought black out curtains, so nothing could look in at me either.\n\nI moved out a few days ago, I had graduated and was excited to be going away for college. \n\nIt had been a year since my excursion into the cemetery, and my senior year had been so busy that I forgot about. It had been so surreal, so otherworldly terrifying, that I convinced myself that it had been a bad dream, even though deep down I knew it wasn’t.\n\nThe day I left the memory of that night, and the woman resurfaced. \n\nI was more than happy when me and my parents finished packing and finally drove off. Of course, I couldn’t help but peek at the cemetery.\n\nNothing. There was nothing there, and I smiled because I could lay that memory to rest.\n\nAt least, that’s what I thought. \n\nYou see, I’ve been having strange dreams lately. In my dreams, it’s always night. There are no stars, only the moon, and it is the color of fresh dark blood.\n\nThat woman is there. She stands in front of me, smiling that wide toothy grin. She dips her finger into something I thought was paint, but now I see her palms are bleeding. She is drawing with her own blood.\n\nShe is so close I can smell the rotting fruit on her breath, and her hair tickles my face. I am frozen in place as her canvas, so still as she draws clumsily on my forehead.\n\n“Mine,” she rasps. “Mine.” It is all she ever says.\n\nWhen she is done, I wake up drenched in sweat.\n\nThis night was different, though. See, after she drew on my forehead, she grasped my shoulders with strong hands and pointed. \n\nIt was a headstone with my name, my birthdate, and this year as the date of my death. \n\nBelow it scrawled in red is a face, its eyes are black circles, and its mouth is downturned into a frown.\n\nI would just chalk it up to another nightmare, I mean what else could it possibly be? But when I woke up and went to the bathroom, I saw my reflection.\n\nOn my forehead is the face with empty sockets for eyes. When I touch it, my hand comes away wet and smeared with blood.\n\nI can hear her now, beneath my window, she’s calling for me.\n\n“Mine…” she says. “Mine.”\n\nI realize now that she’s marked me and no matter where I go, she’ll just follow. \n\nI used to live by a cemetery and I’ve learned that curiosity has many consequences and that it is best to leave the dead and their resting place alone.",

        "text": "Let me tell about a man I met back in 2003, by the name of Martin.\n\nWhen I met him, he told me he was 35 years old. A plump, ordinary man by almost every metric. A slightly receding hairline, but clearly no anxiety or shame about his looks could be found on his warm smiling face. He easily spoke about all of the little things that interested him in life. He told me about how he loved to carve wood, types letters on his vintage typewriter, fold paper cranes, coach youth tee-ball games, and even how he enjoyed stepping on every crunchy leaf come fall. A self describe \"analogue\" man. By every metric, an honest, small town, optimist.\n\n90 minutes before our conversation took place, Martin had shot and killed a defenseless man outside of a gas station. I was the one who was taking his statement at the police station.\n\nThe town I was called into was lucky to have a 4 digit population come Christmas time (with relatives coming to visit and all that). This has stuck with me all this time because I haven't had a conversation like it before or since. It all started because someone was trying to rob the gas station. A wanted felon by the name Eddy Murklay was on the lamb, he had been running from the police for two days. He pulled into the BP gas station and filled his tank at the pump, like anyone would. Afterwards he stepped inside and pulled a gun on the owner, demanding he empty the register. The owner did as he was told, but unfortunately for Eddy the teller's grandson had been hiding in the back when all of this started. The instant Eddy wasn't pointing his gun at his grandpa, he tackled him from behind. The two men pinned Eddy to the ground and threw his gun away from him. They kept him that way until the local sheriff arrived minutes later. Eddy was cuffed to the metal bench outside the gas station as the sheriff made a call to the feds that were looking for him. \n\nThe thing with small towns, police sirens going off out of nowhere has the same effect as ringing people's doorbells. Townsfolk came outside by the dozens to see what was going on. Martin was no different, he told me that he made it a point to walk directly to the gas station after hearing the sheriff rip past while on his evening walk. The sheriff had the deputy keeping everyone at a reasonable distance, but Martin apparently used to work at the gas station so he had the excuse to check on the owner. He tells me that the owner and his grandson were a bit jittery after the confrontation. The owner asked Martin to do him a favor and get the handgun out from under the shelf he threw it under. Martin agreed, went inside, and fished out the handgun from underneath the motor oil shelf. He stepped outside and tried to hand the gun to the sheriff, but was hand waved away as the sheriff was arguing on the phone at the time. Martin then walked around aimlessly for a few moments, then strolled up to Eddy, who was cursing and shouting at everyone looking at him. Martin looked at the gun, and then shot the still hand cuffed Eddy Murklay in the head, killing him instantly. \n\nI spoke with Martin about what he did. I was called in to talk to Eddie, but that was out of the question now. I didn't know I was going to be talking to Martin until I had already arrived. I was the one to talk to him because no one else knew what to do. Martin was not handcuffed when I walked in, he was hanging out in the lobby of the police station as if he was their visiting an old friend or waiting to pick up someone for lunch. The sheriff looked dumb founded, like he was trying to parse together a puzzle that was only one color. He and the other deputies were concerned for Martin's health, something clearly was wrong and they were powerless to find out on their own it seemed. I learned two important things about Martin over the course of my conversation with him.\n\nThe first thing was that Martin was openly a sadist.\n\n He, with very little prompting, gushed about how funny he thought it was when he shot the gun off and scared everyone. He described it as though he had pulled a prank, like setting off a firecracker in your brother's bedroom, as opposed to having murdered someone. Martin says he always loved pranks like that when he was a kid. That he would get in trouble more often than not, but he would still do them because they made him happy. He lamented that he didn't pull pranks like that anymore, and that he's been feeling nothing but nostalgic since he pulled this one off.\n\nThe second thing I learned about Martin was a bit more... complicated. \n\nYou see, Martin thought that everything was... alive. Not in the sense like you or I would would consider something alive. Apparently, Martin would have you believe that EVERYTHING was capable of human levels of comprehension. The grass on the ground, the sign on the wall, even the un-sharpened the pencil in his pocket was capable of thought and understand it's own existence. He said it didn't matter if it was a wad of gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe, the tires on a Chevy outback, or a chewed up old baseball, everything was alive.\n\nMartin was also convinced, more than anything in the whole world, that everything had the capacity to feel pain. Martin talked for a solid 10 minutes about the bullet that killed Eddy Murklay. How scared it must have been, trapped inside it's casing, dreading the day where it would instantaneously be scorched by gunpowder, launched hundreds of miles per hour, only to have it's body torn asunder when it made impact with something. How horrible it must be, to be trapped in the hot, wet, mush that is Eddy's brain matter with nowhere to go, no way to scream out for help. Dreading the future where it might be buried along with Eddy, stuck for eternity inside the rotting flesh of a man he was used to kill. He spoke with more empathy and concern for the bullet than he did about Eddy. When I questioned him about this contradiction, he said:\n\n\"I mean, the fella got off easy. He died right away. The funny thing is... I don't even know if it's possible for a bullet to die...\"\n\nMy first inclination was to think he was clearly under the influence of something. Some kind of long form substance abuse that culminated in a nervous breakdown at the wrong place at the wrong time. That's what I was telling myself until I left to get myself a cup of coffee. When I was back into the room, I saw that Martin had pulled out his un-sharpened pencil and a small plastic sharpener he apparently had on him. \n\nHe was just... giggling to himself. With every minor twist of the pencil, flakes of wood and lead were shaved away. He didn't even notice that I had enter the room again, he was too busy amusing himself, by sharpening a pencil. Turning and turning, he kept going until it was nothing but a nub and small pile of #2 pencil debris. I heard him whisper under his breath after he realized that he couldn't continue:\n\n\"Man, that's gotta hurt, huh buddy?\"\n\nHe openly chortled to himself, only then did he notice that I was staring at him. He smiled and apologized for the mess. I no longer doubted Martin was being genuine. The last thing I asked him was what other people thought of his... particular habits. He pondered for a moment, shrugged, and said no one had really asked him until now.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing really came of my interview. Eddie Murklay was recorded on camera shooting a cop in the lung two days prior to my meeting with Martin. My transcripts weren't going to be read anyway, it was just a matter of formalities. There was no need for a confession when there was bullet proof evidence like that. I also don't think the sheriff or anyone at the police station looked into it either, last I heard they took Martin to the local clinic because his ears were still ringing from the gunshot. \n\nNobody was going to convict Martin, why would they? Everyone already knows everyone. Martin was a town favorite, he was the upbeat, glass half full, small town guy that everyone loved. He mowed everyone's lawn for free come summer time, he collected and burned everyone's yard trimming without even being asked, and he taught every young man within city limits how to hit a baseball out of the kindness of his own heart. It didn't matter that he shot a killed a man in cold blood in front of everyone. They had already decided how they saw him, and what they saw made them happy.\n\nI've been thinking about Martin a lot recently. Just the sheer statistical likelihood of having two disparate characteristics that form such a macabre symbiosis. I find myself... a little bit jealous sometimes? If I'm being honest, I wish I could find pleasure in such small things like sharpening a pencil. These feelings of jealously don't last long however, as the sense of creeping unease retakes in throne in my gut. As far as I know, Martin spent his entire life more than satisfied with pencil shavings until Eddy came along... I just worry if or when the next Eddy is gonna show up.\n\nI've been thinking about Martin a lot recently. It's fall again, there are \"dead\" leaves all around. I wonder if Martin will run out of leaves to step on anytime soon.",

        "text": "I’m using this post to chronicle the events of this evening, as they have been truly fascinating.\n\nSome quick backstory: the small section of the city that me and my friends live is generally known to be haunted. And even if you’re not a believer in the supernatural… it’s at least a bit eerie. I’m not going to dox myself by stating the location, but let’s just say that “creepy sightings” and murders/deaths due to unexplainable circumstances are our bread and butter. \n\nFor most people, this means you move away as soon as they can.\n\nFor folks like me and my friends (who absolutely love all things spine-chilling), it generally makes for a pretty good time. Our Halloween parties are awesome, most of our drinking nights have some sort of spooky game interlaced into them, and if you have literally nothing to do on a Friday night with your friends, you can always go on a tour of some of our haunted locales - graveyards, abandoned buildings, creepy forests, you name it. \n\nSo, with that background established, let’s cut back to tonight: \n\nMe and my closest three pals decided to try our hand at using a Ouija board. Were we going to be normal and try the Ouija board in one of our family attics? Nah, too basic. We instead decided to trek up together to, what I shit you not, is an abandoned treehouse left in an elevated section of our city, surrounded by forests. What could go wrong, right?\n\nWe climbed up to the treehouse, set down a spooky themed rug, lit some candles, and brought out the ouija board. Despite my pretty extensive resume of dealing with all things creepy, I’d never actually tried a Ouija board before, so I was really excited to see what would happen.\n\nWe went into this excited to break every rule in the book - we weren’t going to do a seance, we were going to ask whatever we want, and we didn’t need to worry about being respectful to the spirit, etc - we figured if something interesting were to happen, it’d be more likely if we went in as carefree as possible. \n\nWe sat in a circle around the ouija board and got started, asking the simple question “Is there a spirit with us?” with all of our hands placed on the planchette. No real response - we fluttered the planchette in a few different directions but we could tell we were kind of forcing it.\n\nWe asked a few other questions - “What is your name?”, “When did you die?”, etc. but nothing really came of it. \n\nAfter trying for the next half hour and not really getting anything in the form of a response, we decided that we probably didn’t have any spooky luck tonight, and opted instead to share scary stories in the treehouse. We left the ouija board out just in case we’d get luckier later in the night.\n\nAmidst a break in our storytelling where everyone was grabbing drinks and snacks from their bags, I decided to give the ouija board another quick go. I placed my hand on the planchette alone and whispered the following question - “Will you please grace us with your presence tonight?”\n\nSurprisingly, the planchette started moving. It’s hard to explain, but you kind of *know* when something is moving on its own, versus you sort of subtly and subconsciously moving it with your hand to force an answer. This felt real. A tingle went up my spine. It was cool as hell. My hand was moved to the following letters.\n\nY E S\n\nAwesome! I looked over to the group and told them that the Ouija board was working again. Excitedly, we all huddled around and placed our hands on the planchette. I followed up with another question.\n\n“Where are you from?”\n\nWe sat there excitedly waiting for something. Instead… nothing. The planchette was still. The lack of any sort of external force with us was very, very obvious. Disappointing, but I had an idea I wanted to follow up with. I turned to my friend Kevin and asked him: “Do you want to try doing it solo? It worked for me.”\n\nKevin was confused, but he decided to give it a try. We all backed up to give him some space with the Ouija board. He placed his hand on the planchette and repeated my question: “Where are you from?”\n\nHis expression changed to shock as his hand started moving with the planchette. He turned to all of us and mouthed “I’m not doing this!” to which I excitedly mouthed back “I know!”. I pulled out a notepad and recorded the answer as the planchette went from letter to letter. I recorded the following:\n\nN O T  I M P O R T A N T\n\nLove it! A spirit with some sass. I asked Kev to back up for a sec as I approached the ouija board, prepped for one final “solo” question. I asked:\n\n“Why are you only responding when it’s one of us using the board?”\n\nYet again, the planchette moved effortlessly with my hand. It was faster this time, so I said the letters out loud and had another one of my friends (Eleonora) transcribe onto my notepad. The answer was:\n\nO N E  A T  A  T I M E\n\nFair enough! I thanked the spirit, my hand still on the planchette. \n\n“I appreciate your answers, friend!”.\n\nTo my surprise, in a strange synergy between me and the spirit, I felt compelled to move the planchette again. It was the fastest it had ever been this time as it covered the following letters:\n\nT E L L  E V E R Y O N E  E L S E  T O  L E A V E\n\n*Huh.* \n\nMy friends looked at me skeptically as I said the letters at a time. \n\n“Are you sure you didn’t just force that on purpose?” asked Eleonora - I assured her I definitely didn’t. That was definitely from the spirit. \n\nAt this point, this had been the most clearly supernatural phenomena I’d ever experienced in my life, and I was excited to keep it going. My friends, usually unflinching and made of ice, were a little bit thrown. Eleonora and Martin looked ever so slightly spooked, but Kev was willing to go with it. “Might as well see where this goes!” Kev said, as he started climbing down from the treehouse. With a slight bit of hesitation, Eleonora and Martin followed suit.\n\nSweet. An *actually creepy* night.\n\nI embraced the quiet amidst the lighting of the candles and the power of the Ouija board. I geared up for my next question. I wasn’t going to hold back.\n\n“Spirit… how will I die?”\n\nI took in a deep breath, waiting for some movement. Slowly… \n\nD E P E N D S\n\nInteresting answer! If not a bit underwhelming. I geared up for my follow-up.\n\n“Oh come on Spirit… what about something a bit more specific?”\n\nMy hand moved with the planchette, to the following letters. I tried hard to focus and connect the letters since I didn’t have anyone to transcribe with me:\n\nW H A T  I S  Y O U R  N A M E?\n\nWeird. Completely dodged my question and asked me my name. Okay *all-knowing spirit*, I assumed you’d already know that. I decided to try tricking it.\n\n“My name is Belle!”\n\nMovement from the planchette on the Ouija board. It took me to the letters:\n\nD O  N O T  L I E\n\nHm. *Well-played, spirit*. I gave the spirit my *actual* name (Jennifer), and continued to see the follow-up response.\n\nW H A T  I S  Y O U R  F A V O R I T E  F O O D\n\nHonoring the spirit’s rules, I opted to tell the truth instead of following up with another lie. Ya girl loves Donair and this spirit deserves to know that.\n\nThe ouija board’s response:\n\nC O R R E C T\n\nBefore I could take in the affirmation from the spirit (*who is asking who questions here, spirit?*) it followed up with yet another question.\n\nW H A T  I S  Y O U R  B I G G E S T  F E A R  D O  N O T  L I E\n\nThis question took me aback a bit. I wasn’t really afraid of anything, or so I thought. So I struggled with it. It took me a few moments. I really, really thought of it. I kind of cringed at the answer, but it was my truth.\n\n“Something horrible happening to my little brother.” \n\nNo movement from the ouija board. Seconds turned into minutes as I kept my hand awkwardly placed on the planchette. Then, finally…\n\nT H A N K  Y O U \n\nS E N D  E L E O N O R A\n\nWelp. I obliged. I thanked the spirit for its time and decided to climb down from the treehouse, where my friends were waiting. I passed on the spirit’s message, and told Eleonora that it was her turn.\n\n—\n\nMartin, Kev and I spent what must’ve been fifteen minutes standing outside the treehouse while Eleonora was up there. We’d pulled drinks out of our bags and were discussing my experience with the Ouija Board so far. Both were incredibly surprised when I told them that the spirit was asking *me* questions.\n\n“What kinds of questions?”\n\n“Generic stuff, like my name, favorite food, etc.” I answered.\n\n“Weird.”\n\nBoth Kev and Martin seemed a bit thrown off by it, but I was excited.\n\nWe looked up at the treehouse as we heard the sounds of someone climbing down. Eleonora had finished her session. She looked traumatized.\n\n“How was it?” I asked her.\n\n“Weird. All it did was ask me questions.”\n\n“Questions like…” Kevin asked her.\n\n“My name. My favorite hobby. My uh, biggest fear. That one took me a while to answer.”\n\nKev turned to me. “That is a little bit eerie.” he said. I agreed. Didn’t look like Eleonora was loving it either. But still - a spirit asking *us* questions? This had been one of the coolest, if not *the coolest,* paranormal experiences I’d ever experienced in my life. \n\nEleonora turned to Martin.\n\n“It said that you were up next.”\n\n— \n\nMartin’s session seemed longer than the others. We stood outside, drinking, talking about the happenings so far, and pulling out the occasional snack.\n\n“That was a little bit traumatizing,” said Eleonora.\n\nKevin pointed to her, and then up to the treehouse.\n\n“Agreed, this is kind of messed up,” he said.\n\n“Yeah, but that’s the point!” I responded. “We seek out spooky happenings all the time and we never get lucky, this is an actual *legit* supernatural experience. I feel like we have to take advantage of it.”\n\n“Even if it’s asking us personal stuff? What does it want this info for?” followed up Eleonora. \n\nI shrugged. While the “biggest fear” question was pretty weird, I didn’t feel too worried that a spirit knew my favorite food was or what my name was.\n\nOur conversation was interrupted by the sound of someone climbing down from the treehouse. Martin had finished up his session. It felt like it’d been 30 minutes, which topped the rest of our sessions. We bombarded Martin with questions as he reached the ground. He looked more shellshocked than Eleonora did.\n\n“That was pretty fucked up,” he started.\n\n“What did it ask you?!” I asked enthusiastically.\n\n“My biggest fear,” Martin responded. “It’s weird but, it felt like it didn’t like my answer to that one. It almost seemed annoyed.”\n\n“Huh… so was it just silent for a while after that?” I asked.\n\n“No… it asked me way more things after that. What the happiest moment of my life was, who I was the most jealous of, what my biggest life dream was, all that stuff… It was a lot of questions. Then, finally, it just wrapped up with “Thank You” and that was that.”\n\nMartin turned to Kevin.\n\n“You’re up next.”\n\nKevin turned to all of us, “Here goes nothing,” he sighed and started climbing up to the treehouse. We watched him make his way to the top. \n\nFor the first time in the evening, I had a knot in my stomach.\n\n—\n\nOnly five minutes had passed since Kevin first went up, but he was already climbing down. He was shaking his head as he made his way down the ladder and to our group.\n\n“Fuck that” said Kevin.\n\n“What happened?!” we asked him. He just shook his head.\n\n“That shit is dangerous. We need to get the fuck out of here, ASAP.”\n\nI’d never seen Kevin like this. He was uncharacteristically shook.\n\n“You have to tell us more. What did it ask you? What did it say?” but Kevin ignored all of our questions. He started packing up his bag. \n\n“You guys can play with fire if you want, but I’m out of here. I suggest you guys come too,” he said. I watched as Martin and Eleonora started packing up as well.\n\n“I had bad feelings throughout this whole thing - I think we should leave,” said Martin. \n\n“Guys, what the hell?! Just ‘cause it’s unsettling doesn’t mean we have to pack up. We can just hang out up there and do something else,” I said back. \n\n“This doesn’t feel right,” said Eleonora. I watched them as they all took a few steps away from the treehouse and towards the forest.\n\n“You coming?” asked Kevin. I stood my ground. Kevin just shook his head and started heading out on his way.\n\n“Suit yourself.” \n\nI had no idea what could have possibly happened up there that would’ve shook him this much. He had already started walking as Martin and Eleonora pleaded with me to come with them. \n\nI said no. \n\nBegrudgingly, they all left.\n\nYou’re probably wondering - wasn’t I scared? Especially now that I was alone? \n\nThe answer was yes. *But,* something in my soul told me that I was up next. I’d spent my whole life waiting for something that was truly supernatural to happen, and now it was in front of me. With my fingers jittering, I climbed up to the treehouse as my friends departed.\n\n— \n\nIt took me a moment to pull together the bravery to put my hand on the planchette. The candles were still lit. The setting was just right. Finally, I spoke to the spirit again. \n\n“Why are you asking us all these questions?”\n\nNothing, for a few minutes. Then, my hand moved with the planchette, slower than usual. The answer:\n\nT O  C O N F I R M  M Y  S U S P I C I O N S\n\n“Confirm your suspicions of *what?”*\n\nMovement from the planchette on the ouija board:\n\nO N E  O F  Y O U  I S  N O T  W H O  Y O U  S A Y  Y O U  A R E\n\n“What are you talking abou–”\n\nI heard blood-curdling shrieks coming from the forest outside the treehouse. Like nothing I’d ever heard before. What the fuck.\n\nThe planchette was moving on its own now. I watched it go from letter to letter:\n\nT H A T  I S  N O T  K E V I N\n\nH E  I S  C O M I N G  B A C K  F O R  Y O U\n\nR U N\n\n…\n\nAnd so I did.\n\n— \n\nThe small section of the city I live in is generally known to be haunted. I think I know why. \n\nIt’s time for me to leave.",

        "text": "PART 1\n\nWhat’s the worst thing you’ve ever done? Was it horrible? Unspeakable? Straight up Evil maybe? Was it bad enough for you to end up in hell for eternity over? I ponder those questions as I sit here typing away on this keyboard with an uncertain future. I did terrible things in my life sure. But I never really considered myself evil. \nI didn’t remember how I died. All I remember is waking up in a haze. My senses were groggy. My throat was dry and my eyes hurt. It was dark, almost pitch black, wherever I was. The air was hot and sticky. It reeked of rotten and burning meat. I tried to cry out. But my throat had trouble producing the words. Like I said, my throat was dry. I tried to move but my muscles screamed as I lifted my arms. That was when I realized I’d been chained to the floor. I pulled a little harder. The chains were heavy. But I still managed to move. They made this god awful screech as they were drug across the hard floor. I groaned as I pulled them. The last thing I was expecting, was the voice. \n\n\t“Mr. David Stone….” The voice called out. It seemingly came from all directions at once.\n\t“Wh-Where?” \n\t“Where you are is not important. Now, listen to my instructions very carefully. I won’t repeat myself. All you need to know is that you exist now as a battery. And I am the one assigned to make sure you stay charged.” \n\t“What?” I asked. \n\tA sudden shock of electricity came flooding through me. My muscles tensed as I screamed I’m agony. \n\t“Don’t interrupt me.” The voice sneered. \n\tThe voice wasn’t particularly deep or intimidating. It did seem hollow and void of any kind of emotion. I couldn’t tell if it belonged to a male or female. \n\t“Now, in order for you to stay charged. There are various things I must make you feel. None of them will you find pleasurable. You will cry. You will feel pain like you’ve never felt while you were alive on earth. You will beg me for death. But in the end. Your calls for mercy will fall on deaf ears. There is no mercy down here. Only suffering. Take consolation in the knowledge that your sacrifice, be it deserved or not, will serve to benefit Gehenna and all of its denizens. In the end, your suffering is the most honorable thing your kind will ever accomplish in its entire miserable existence.” \n\tI sat there silently, my muscles still aching from the electric current that had just torn through me. My eyes still trying to scan the darkness. What was Gehenna? Was I here to be tortured? My mind was having trouble trying to comprehend. \n\t“I’m sure you have several questions, Mr. Stone. Unfortunately, I run a tight ship and have little time on my hands. So I’ll allow you one.”\n\tMy mind was still far from being stable. I had so many questions but I just couldn’t bring any to my lips. I strained for a second before I got to my feet. \n\n\t“Who are you?” I asked with a horse voice that was almost a whisper.\n\t“My name is Saxon. You will address me as Master!”\n\tThat was when the lights came on. I found myself sitting in a glass box that seemed to float a few feet from the ground. The chains wrapped around me were blacker then black. They were crude in their design. I wondered how they’d managed to get electric currents through it. But I only wondered for a split second as my eyes shot up to the being standing before me. It looked like man, but it was far from human. Its body was human, it was pale, almost paper white. Its head looked like that of an angry lizard. It’s features were reptilian, from the slits where it’s nose should be to the inky black eyes. I could make out a row of sharp serrated looking teeth behind its thin lips. The creature showed no expression towards me. It just stared into my very soul. I froze in fear as we locked eyes. \n\n\t“Welcome to Gehenna, Mr. Stone. Or as you humans say, Welcome to Hell!” \n\n\t\n\n\tThe next few hours were a blur as I regained my senses. The chains had fallen off. My glass box had been moved into a giant row of glass boxes. Each of them had their own occupant. Most were men from what I could tell. Everyone sat in a corner kind of just staring out into space. I think that was when it actually dawned on me that everyone, including myself, was completely naked. Naked and mostly hairless. I remember running my hand across my now bald head as I turned around. My muscles ached with every movement.\n\n\t“It grows back. Then they shave it. Makes us easier to torture.” A voice said from the cell next to me. \n\t“What?” I asked as my eyes met his. \n\tThe man in the cell next to mine was a tall, broad, and hairless black guy who had a wide smile across his face.\n\t“Your hair. For your denizen body.” He said as he pointed to his head. \n\t“My denizen what?” I asked. \n\t“Your denizen body. At least that’s what the Hellspawn around here call it. It’s the body they assign your soul too when it comes down!” \n\n\tI was a bit confused and my face showed it. He only chuckled a bit. \n\t“You must be really new here! Tell me, do your muscles hurt? Like when you move?” he asked. \n\tI nodded. \n\t“That’s because you’ve never used them before. Your body was grown in the flesh pits on the second level. When you died, your soul was sent straight there and then assigned a function. I guess you drew the short straw, cause you get to be a battery!”\n\t“A battery for what?” I asked.\n\tThe man put his hands up, “All of this! This place feeds off of negative energy.” \n\tI was still confused as hell. But my brain started to register. I raised a brow at him as I stepped closer to the wall. \n\t“So I’m dead? And this is hell?”\n\tThe man nodded. \n\t“Do you remember your name yet?” he asked.\n\tI thought hard about it. I wasn’t sure about my name. I didn’t even know who I was. \n\t“The uhh.. The creature called me David.” I said. \n\t“Well… David. My name is Dwayne.” \n\t“Like the Rock?” I asked. \n\t“Rock?” he asked with a confused look. \n\tMy brain went fuzzy for a second. I’d actually remembered something. \n\t“He’s an actor. Big dude, used to be a wrestler!” \n\tDwayne shook his head from side to side. \n\t“I’m going to be completely honest with you, David. I was killed in nineteen-seventy-two.”\n\t“How?” I asked. \n\t“Nam! How’d you die?” he replied.\n\tI sighed as I tried to remember. He only took a deep breath. \n\t“It’ll come back to you.” \n\tMy thought process, however, was interrupted by a buzzer that rang so loud it made my ears hurt. My hands shot to my ears as I dropped to my knees. My ears were ringing and I could feel blood beginning to gush out. Then, just as fast as it started, it stopped. \n\n\t“What was that?” I asked as my eyes tilted over to Dwayne.\n\t“Torture time.” The man said as he got back to his feet. \n\t“Torture time?” I asked. \n\t“Twenty-three hours a day! Used to be longer but the hellspawn all went on strike!” \n\t“Seriously?” I asked. \n\tDwayne smirked at me, “No… Rumor has it-“\n\tDwayne’s speech was interrupted by a sudden spike that shot up from the floor of his cube. It was thin and translucent like the glass that made up the cube itself. It went through the bottom of his foot and through his armpit before exiting the shoulder. Dwayne groaned in pain as his hand shot out and grabbed it. A crimson pool had already started below him. \n\t“Oh, God!” I said as I tried to keep myself from vomiting. \n\tMy luck, however, wasn’t any better as a spike came horizontally in my cell. I tried to dodge, I thought maybe I could duck out of the way. But it was a stupid and foolish idea. The spike hit me in the right side of my chest before exploding through my back. Blood splattered all over the back of my cell. I screamed in agony as another spike flew through my back and exploded out of my stomach. \n\tI could feel the hot tears and blood flowing down my face. The pain was indescribable. I looked over at Dwayne, who winced as another spike came flying through his back and out his front. \n\tThe last thing I remember was looking at one of the glass walls. It seemed to vibrate at a certain point. Almost like a disturbance in water from a specific angle before a spike came flying directly at my face. \n\n—\n\nWhen I woke up. I found myself floating in a pool of a warm sticky fluid. I was still in my glass box though. I groaned as my body went vertical. My feet touched the ground and my eyes shot directly ahead of myself. Where Saxon stood with a disappointed look on his face. \n\t“Mr. Stone… You’re not supposed to pass out during your draining sessions. You only lasted twenty seconds. Each session lasts twenty-three hours.” \n\tI could feel myself about to say something, but then I remembered the last time I’d spoken out of line. \n\t“I know you’re new down here. It takes time to adjust.”\n\tI felt the area on my forehead where the spike had impaled my face. I could hear Saxon exhale at this. \n“You’re not dead, because your body was grown to regenerate. You can come back from any wound, it helps one last a bit longer during our sessions. The only thing that could really kill your body is one of these,” He said as he held up a obsidian black short sword. \n“A weapon from our armory.” \n \tI didn’t say anything in response. I just watched the weapon as he moved it around. My mind immediately wondering how I could take it from him and bust out of here. Only problem was, he seemed to notice. My thought process was interrupted by a sudden and abrupt shock that made my muscles clamp up. I roared in pain as I fell underneath the translucent liquid. I had my mouth open, the stuff burned like acid as it went down my throat and into my lungs.\n\tIt took me a second to come up for air and cough the substance up. I could see Saxon smile at me as he stepped closer to the glass. His sharp and serrated teeth were yellow and blood stained.\n\t“Insubordination will not be tolerated, Mr Stone.”\n\tBy now I could feel the anger rising in my gut. I wanted to get out and kill this thing. But I didn’t know how. I could only glare at him through the glass as he turned and walked away. The liquid in my box slowly started to drain. I found myself covered in it. My cell moved itself back into the line of other cells. Where I saw Dwayne trying his best to reattach one of his arms. I inhaled as I watched the veins and muscles seemingly stitch themselves together. It looked disgusting. It also looked painful, Dwayne winced hard as the muscles and sinus reconnected. \n\t“Don’t worry about him. No one stays conscious the whole day.” He said with a grunt.\n\t“What?”\n\t“Those that do are taken to another level. Most of them are fucking sadists anyway.” \n\t“Where are they taken?” I asked.\n\tDwayne shrugged. “Never been out of this box! You’re lucky you came on the spike day. Yesterday we were eaten by hellhounds.” \n\tMy eyes got big as i exhaled. This was the new forever for me. I sat down and leaned my back against the wall. The sticky substance that’d slathered up my body acted as an adhesive. I felt like my back was coated in syrup and I’d laid down against something. I didn’t really care though. My mind thought on Saxon’s sword. \n\n\tThat was when another image flashed through my mind. I remembered being on a rooftop. I was surrounded by men in black uniforms that’d all had assault rifles aimed at me. I had my pistol raised at them as well. It was cold outside, quite possibly the middle of winter. To my right stood a priest. I couldn’t tell you his name if I tried. But he was on my side. I had thought we were about to die. I was ready to die right there. But someone saved us. It was a man, a man in a black metallic suit of armor. One who wielded a short sword that was glowing a neon blue color. The man cut through the soldiers like they were made of paper. He saved us. \n\tMy mind reeled from the memory. I took a deep breath as I looked across my cell at Dwayne. Who sat there watching me. Then I looked at the cell behind me. It was empty, I’d remembered there being a person in there when I’d first been brought in. I turned back to Dwayne with a perplexed look on my face. \n\t“He’s today’s special battery.” Dwayne said with a sad look in his eye. \n\t“What’s that mean?” I asked. \n\t“Saxon’s special batteries get to power the appetites of the master himself.”\n\t“Appetites?” \n\t\n\tAs of on que, the man was being drug back in by two more larger men. Both of which were wearing thick black collars that seemed to be made of the same metal that had created my shackles from earlier. The glass on the cell slid open and the man was sloppily tossed in. I watched the two burly men as they walked away. They actually wore baggy burlap looking pants. My eyes met one of two’s. The man seemed to immediately look away. Almost like he was afraid. \n\t“Those are Saxon’s personal slaves. Every once in a while a soul comes through that he takes a liking too.” \n\t“Sounds a hell of a lot better then this.” I said.\n\t“Believe me… They’re not any better off then we are.”\n\tMy eyes shifted to the man in the other cell. He was a chubbier man that was also completely hairless like we were. He was curled up in a ball in the center of his cell. I could hear him sobbing. My eyes shifted back to Dwayne. \n\t“What did you mean by appetites?” I asked. \n\tDwayne took a deep, shaky breath. \n\t“It depends on how Saxon is feeling that day. Sometimes he’s hungry…. Sometimes he’s horny… Sometimes he wants to do the torturing himself.” \n\tI grunted and mumbled under my breath. \n\t“You were thinking about taking his sword.. He can sense defiance you know! That one behind you, he was a Lawyer in Maryland before he was killed by some drug dealer. I think he abused his wife. Came down here and immediately started making demands. Threatened to sue several times. He was defiant until he became the favorite battery. He’s been the favorite battery since he came here.” \n\t“When was that?” I asked. \n\t“Ten maybe fifteen years ago…. No ones even thought twice about crossing Saxon since. Not that we could if we tried.” \n\tI sighed as I leaned my head back and closed my eyes.\n\t“I can see the defiance in your eyes David. Do yourself a favor, don’t buy into it.” \n\n\tIt was too little, too late however. I’d already made up my mind. I was gonna find a way to kill this Saxon. I didn’t care if it took me a hundred or a thousand years. I could do it. I would do it.",

        "text": " \n\nI have nothing left. I have no money to buy myself out of here. I have no friends who could help. I have no safe space where I could hide. I still have the tablet I am writing on, but no way to recharge it. Once the battery runs out, I won’t even have light. I’ll be trapped down here in the dark, listening to the thing behind the metal door as it tries to force its way out. Claws scraping over metal - howling and shrieking - those will be the last sounds I hear in this world.\n\nI have nothing, but I still have hope. \n\nI still have hope, and that’s the most terrifying thing of them all.\n\n\\-\n\nYou could buy hope from a fortune teller at a local fair. It was early summer. I had not wanted to go to the fair, but some friends had forced me to tag along. I had also not wanted to enter the fortune teller’s tent, but the old woman had promised me my money back if I was left dissatisfied by her reading, and so I had given in. Maybe screwing her out of her pay would lighten my mood, or so I thought at the time. Now I was sitting in front of her, while her fingers brushed over the tarot cards laid out in front of her.\n\n“Hmm. I can see it all clearly. Your destiny is in the cards,” She said, and flipped the first card. “The ace of pentacles. Wealth - money - opportunity… The picture is becoming clearer. Yes - You have just graduated business school - top of your class - and you have worked out a foolproof plan to make money. It will make you rich. It will lead you right to the top.” She flipped open the next card. \n\n“The tower… Danger - change - disruption. You are at the crossroads of your life - about to embark into the real world. Success and failure are so close together. Ah! I can see it -… you are planning something. Something big… You need money… You are about to meet people - wealthy people - people you need to convince to invest in your plans, and you are worried…”\n\nShe glanced up at me, to gauge my reaction, but I just rolled my eyes. She had been absolutely correct with her entire prediction, which would have been impressive if it wasn’t for the fact that one of my drunken college buddies had been in here just before me. He had probably spent the entire time complaining about my sour mood, inadvertently feeding this old trickster all of this information. Maybe she had hoped to impress me with this little trick. Maybe that’s why she had promised me my money back to begin with.\n\nShe instantly picked up on the fact that her little game wasn’t working. With swift motion she swiped the cards from the table separating the two of us. Her face remained neutral.\n\n“You are afraid,” she said, and leaned closer. “You are worried you might not be able to convince these people. You are worried you might fail - something that has never happened to you before. I can help though. You already have everything you need. You are only lacking one thing. One single thing. Hope!” She twirled her hand, and when her fingers unfolded, a single box of matches was suddenly resting on her palm. “You just need a little push - something to give your confidence a boost. Hope will do that. Hope…”\n\n“Right,” I said, drawing out the world. I rolled my eyes again. The woman motioned for me to take the matchbox. It felt light. I slid it open. Empty. - “Wow,” I said. “How impressive.”  \n\n“There’s nothing in there yet, obviously,” she answered. “We need to fill it first. Just keep looking into the box. Now picture the meeting with your investors. Imagine yourself successful and convincing. Really paint a mental picture of the scene.”\n\n“Uh hu,” I said, taking a huge annoyed breath.\n\n“No. Really picture it in your head. Describe the scene. Tell me exactly what you see. What kind of clothes are the people you are talking to wearing? What kinds of expressions are they making? What are they saying? How does the room smell?  …”\n\nIt went on like this for at least twenty minutes. I’d describe the scene, and the fortune teller would ask me a barrage of little questions about what I was imagining. Then she’d start the whole exercise again - and again - and again… Finally she stopped. Her gaze focused on the matchbox. Her hand darted forward. She snatched it from my fingers, quickly enclosing it in her fist, while whispering some sort of chant. She held the fist close to her mouth for a moment, while her whispers took on more and more of a steady rhythm. After half a minute she opened her fingers once more. The matchbox appeared unchanged.\n\n“There. Now it is full. Full of hope. Take a look. Only open it a crack though. You don’t want all the hope to just escape, do you?”\n\n“No. Of course not. That would be such a terrible tragedy.” I took the matchbox. It still felt just as light as it had before. I had expected that she had at least some slight of hand to exchange it with a different box, but this one seemed just as empty as it had been before. I opened it. “Oh wow. Would you look at that… Nothing. How impressive. So - are we finally done he-”\n\nI stopped mid-sentence. Something was happening. The matchbox was still empty and ordinary, but the longer I stared into it, the more I could feel a scene forming before my inner eyes. It was the very same scene the old woman had made me picture over and over again. I had done it so often, merely looking into the box made me imagine it automatically.\n\n“Huh…” I said to myself. I closed the matchbox, then opened it again. The same thing happened. Close. Open. Close. Open. It happened every time. I scratched my head. “Oh! I get it. It’s like some sort of hypnotic trigger. Gotta admit - that’s a nice little trick..”\n\n“You can call it whatever you like,” she answered. “But it’s hope. Something we all need. It will help you as well. Too much of anything is a bad thing though, so be sure to keep your hopes realistic and grounded. If you let this get too big… -” She gestured at the matchbox “- … it’ll really start messing with your head. You can keep it for free. Only if you were satisfied with my reading, of course. So? Are you satisfied, or would you like your money back?”\n\n\\-\n\nTurns out the old fortune teller was right. I had only needed a little boost in confidence, and the matchbox provided me with just that. One look inside, and I would relive the scene of my success, standing between the smiling faces of my new business partners, shaking their hands as they fought among each other to be the first to sign with me.\n\nThe actual meeting didn’t end up going as smooth and effortless as that of course. A few of my potential backers had some worries, but just when it seemed that they might back out, I pulled out the matchbox, and peeked inside beneath the table. Instantly a renewed mental strength bloomed inside my mind. I knew what I had to do to convince them. \n\nI promised them even higher returns than I had initially alluded to. There was not a trace of doubt in my words, and this show of resolve was the last push needed to get them on my side. When the meeting ended, I had secured half a million dollars in seed money to get me started.\n\nWhy stop there though? The more investment money I could get, the higher the returns. I scheduled another meeting, using my dad’s business contacts to invite even more people. I had already cleared the first hurdle. It would be easy to convince even more people of my plan, and if anybody else turned out to be skeptical, I could always just promise higher profits. My initial projection had been rather conservative after all.\n\nWas there some risk of failure? Of course. There always is. Nobody gets ahead by playing things entirely safe. You have to take a little gamble here and there, and that’s just what I did. I took a little gamble.\n\n\\-\n\nIt went on like this for two months. New money flowed in every day, and my venture grew. So did my funds. I had cracked seven figures by now, and was quickly expanding at a rapid pace. Everything was perfect. Everything except for the little fact that my measly profits lagged behind my lofty promises. I was making money, but it was far less than what my investors were expecting. Would they start withdrawing their funding? Would my business venture fail in its infancy?\n\nMy sour mood was back. I kept relying more and more heavily on the matchbox full of hope to keep it up, but it got harder and harder to do so. Every evening I would sit on my desk and crunch the numbers, and when they once more didn’t come up right, I’d take the box out and peek inside. It felt heavier by now, and its cardboard walls were bulging outward, as if something inside was slowly gaining size. It was just as empty as on the day I bought it though. There was nothing in there - nothing except those luring fantasies. \n\nThe visions were just as strong as they had always been, but they just weren't enough to lift my spirit anymore. I had more pressing problems. I had bigger concerns. I needed something more. I needed something stronger. I needed more hope to get me through this. More hope…\n\nAnd so - on one fateful evening - I took a metal tin of cookies, dumped its content onto the desk, then threw the opened matchbox inside before quickly slamming the lid shut. There… Now my hope would have more room to grow.\n\nIt was a purely symbolic act of course. There wasn’t actually anything in that matchbox that could grow after all. It was all just a little mental trick. - That’s what I told myself at least. On some level I must have already believed that there was something in that box - something that was getting bigger - something alive…\n\nThe next morning I peeked into the cookie tin. Empty - just as expected. There was only the little matchbox. It had somehow opened completely over the course of the night, but before I could wonder how that might have happened, I was struck by another vision. This one was stronger than any I had experienced before. I could see it all so clearly. Of course… How could I have not seen it before?\n\nThe market always fluctuates. There’s ups and downs. Currently we were just stuck in a little downward slide, and yet I was still making money. That meant I’d be making even more once the market turned in my favor. I could see it happening. I could see the curves turning - red numbers switching to green ones, profits rolling in - more than I had ever dared to dream of…\n\nIt was about to happen. It would happen any day now. The vision made me feel absolutely certain about that. I just needed to make sure my current investors wouldn’t jump ship before it all came to pass… I just needed to pretend that the earnings were already this high…\n\nI could trick them. It would be easy. I could take some of the newly incoming money, cook the books a little, and present it as profit instead of actually investing it. That wouldn’t exactly be legal, of course, but that was of little concern. Once the market turned, I could easily patch up any discrepancies. Everybody would be happy once that happened. \n\nIt was a lot more risky than anything I had done before. If my plan failed, I wouldn’t just go bankrupt, I would be facing criminal charges. This was all part of the game though. If things get though, you bend the rules. You gamble big. That’s what you need to do if you want to get rich. That’s how all the rich people do it all the time.\n\nI looked into the cookie tin again, took in the vision, and then I took a gamble.\n\n\\-\n\nThings shifted for the better, things shifted for the worse, and when things went really bad, I refunneled even more money to hide my losses. I took credits from the bank. I convinced my father to invest most of the family fortune into my business. It would all work out in the end. I was utterly convinced that it would. The market would turn in my favor. Any day now. It was about to happen any day…\n\nHope continued to grow. By now there was no denying that it was more than a mental trick. Hope was real. The fortune teller had actually caught something, and trapped it for me, and now it was quickly gaining size. The cookie tin was heavy, as if filled with stones. The metal walls were dented in dozens of places, and more dents appeared every day. I started to wrap duct tape around it, to keep hope trapped inside, but the container was reaching its limits.\n\nMy business was reaching its limits as well. I had strayed further and further along the trajectory of fraud and embezzlement, fueled by the hope that some sudden change in the market would turn the tides and clean the whole mess up. That was becoming increasingly unlikely. \n\nBarely any of the money I was operating with was actually invested any more. I needed all of it to keep my little web of deception from falling apart, constantly shifting it back and forth to patch up holes, only to tear even bigger ones in the process. If I had more, I could make some more daring investments - high risk, high return - but there wasn’t even enough for this kind of desperate measure. It wasn’t enough. I needed more. More. More. More money. More hope.\n\nI transferred Hope into a large reinforced travel suitcase, wrapped in iron chains. Maybe if it was stronger it’d clear my mind of worries long enough to think of a way out. I paced through the room and nervously stared at the suitcase, as it began shaking and trembling. Crunching and cracking sounded from within. The noise growing louder and louder. It went like this for hours, and when it finally quieted down, I dared to unlock it to peek inside.\n\nInstantly the suitcase was flung open by some massive force. Luckily the chains were in place to keep it from opening completely. The iron links grew taut from the internal pressure, while an angry scream roared out at me. Something squirmed and raged in the darkness. A thousand insectile feet clawed against every inch of the little prison. Then all fell silent. I had flung myself away from the suitcase, and was now clinging to the wall on the other side of the room. My heart was beating like crazy. It took me a few minutes until I dared to approach the container.\n\nEmpty.\n\nThe suitcase was empty, safe for the twisted remnants of the cookie tin - now barely recognizable - just a chunk of metal that seemed to have been crushed between sharp teeth and ripped apart by massive claws. There was nothing else in there.\n\nAnd then the vision hit me.\n\nI saw my face look back at me from the cover of the Financial Times. The main article lauded me as the new prodigy of the investment world - a genius - the next great thing. It told the story of how I had overcome certain bankruptcy, clawing my way to success and prosperity through sheer willpower and inborn skill. I had faced down hardship, and came out the other end as a multi-millionaire.\n\nWhen the dream faded I found myself lying on the carpet, staring up at the ceiling with a dazed expression, drooling from the corner of my mouth. There was a huge smile plastered on my face, and a lightness in my mind that I hadn’t felt in weeks. I knew at that moment that everything would be alright in the end. Things were looking grim now, but that just meant I needed to take even more risks. \n\nAll the visionary leaders who had risen to glory from nothing had faced the same moment of struggle and uncertainty that I found myself in right now. This was the moment that separated the chosen ones from the rest. I could back down, accept my punishment like a cowardly criminal, or I could double-down, and dare for something greater. The vision was still playing in front of my eyes. I knew what I had to choose. I was destined for greatness. Eventually I would succeed.\n\nI needed fresh cash first. I already had taken several credits from the major banks. Taking any more of them might lead to some awkward questions. Somebody might decide to take a closer look at my books. I couldn’t allow that to happen. Luckily there were a lot of other places you could turn for a credit - places that were a lot less reputable, and a lot more ruthless when it came to collecting.\n\nI didn’t care about any of that. I could accept their crushing interest rates. I only needed the cash for a little while to kick-start my business back to life. One or two weeks down the line I would have made enough to pay them back with ease. It was a gamble for sure, but I had already taken some major gambles. What did I really have to lose? I was just another gamble…\n\n–\n\nI fell short on my first attempt to get out of the hole I had dug for myself into. This didn’t matter though. There were other loan sharks out there. I could just try again, and again, and again… It was easy to ignore the angry letters. It was easy to ignore the phone calls, and the death treats and the screaming creditors trying to chase me down. \n\nIt was easy to ignore everything, until I woke up one morning to the stench of gasoline and fire. Thick smoke drifted through my bedroom window. A burning wreck of metal stood in my driveway. Somebody had climbed the fence to my home, and set fire to my brand new Mercedes.\n\nAs I watched the firemen douse the flickering flames, I felt reality slowly catch up with me. I was deeper in debt than ever, and the people I owed money to by now would not be content with simply suing me. These were the kind of people who didn’t bother with lawyers. These were the kind of people who would break my kneecaps, harvest my body for organs, toss me from a bridge with a pair of cement shoes, …\n\nI ran up to my office, pulled out every ledger, and scattered documents all over the floor, searching for any kind of asset I could turn into cash. Five million. If I let go of everything I could still scrape together five million. That would have been a staggering sum of money a few months ago. By now it wasn’t even enough to pay back my worst creditors.\n\nWhat options did I even have anymore? I could take the money, get a fake passport, flee the country, try to rebuild my life somewhere far away. What kind of life would that be though? A life of constant fear. A life on the run from both the police and the mob. A life without prospects. A life in which I’d be forever barred from living up to my potential. How long until those five million would run out? What would I do then?\n\nI suddenly found myself standing in the cellar beneath my house. My subconscious had led me down here all on its own. I was standing in front of the hidden old boiler room. A thick iron door was blocking my path. I had just installed it. The suitcase had grown too small for Hope. It was living in this room by now.\n\nI could hear it moving behind the walls as if reacting to my presence. My hair stood on edge. Every sense within me screamed danger, yet I found myself stepping even closer, until I could press my eye against the spy hole of the otherwise featureless door.\n\nIt happened in an instant. One moment I was standing down there in the dark cellar, sweating and shaking, the next I was suddenly sitting on a sofa in a stylish apartment, looking down onto the city from the top floor of its tallest sky-scraper. A group of beautiful people were surrounding me, men and women alike. They leaned closer as I told the story of my most daring feat. I was just reaching the part where I was chased by the mob, utterly bankrupt and out of options. This was where my bad luck had turned around. My listeners held their breath as I reached the climax. \n\nI let them hang for a moment, making a show of sampling the expensive wine instead of continuing. It tasted nearly as sweet and delicious as all of the flattering compliments my companions launched at me to make me continue with my story. It felt so real, I nearly forgot it was a mere fantasy for a moment, but then it ended. I was back in the cellar. \n\nIt had only been a dream, but it had still taken away my panic. I was filled once more with the focused determination that had gotten me this far. I knew exactly what to do. I could have all the money I needed - all in a single day. All it would take was one more gamble.\n\nOne more gamble…\n\n\\-\n\nTwo hours later I stepped out of the rented limo, clutching a briefcase tightly to my chest. It contained what remained of my money  - the entire five million. I swallowed, gathered my strength, and entered the casino with my head held high and a confident smile on my face.\n\nI headed straight to the roulette table. No need to delay the inevitable. This was it. All on red. Everything on this one lucky toss. The wheel spun. The little ball danced across the surface, clicking and rolling. I could focus on nothing else. This ball was my entire world right now. All my senses were completely focused on its erratic motions. Up and down and jumping back and forth from one color to the other - red - black - red - black… The wheel was slowing down. The moment of truth came closer and closer. Red - black - red - black… RED!\n\nI doubled forward. Red. Red. RED! I had won. This would be enough. It wouldn’t be enough to pay back everyone, but enough to get the loan sharks off my back. I wouldn’t get stabbed to death by a bunch of mobsters after all… but I would still go to prison… My whole fraudulent venture would collapse, and they’d drag me to court, and I’d be convicted…\n\nMy life was still effectively over. Sure - I’d be living and breathing and walking around, but that bright future I had dared to imagine would never come to pass. I needed something better. I needed more. Maybe I could… If I bet it all again…All on red… If I managed to win one more time… What did I really have to lose? I had to do it. Another gamble. I had to. \n\nAnother gamble.\n\nAll on red.\n\nThe wheel spun. The ball danced. I was clutching the rim of the table. It was the only way I could remain standing upright. Everything was spinning. Dark dots seemed to dance in front of my eyes. I couldn’t breathe. I could barely even see what was going on. My entire world was reduced to two colors. Red - black - red - black -... RED! RED!!! RED!!!!!\n\nI was screaming in triumph, jumping up and down, my hands held up into the air, unable to contain the powerful rush of dopamine flooding my brain. I had won. This was enough. I’d be able to take care of my bad credits, and then there would still be enough to give my investors their money back - not as much as I had promised them, but they’d all at least break even. It would be enough to keep people from looking too closely at what had been going on. It would be enough to keep them from suing me.\n\nI’d still be personally bankrupt of course. I had lost most of the family fortune on my whole scheme after all. I still had an excellent degree though. I could easily get a well-paying job. It wasn’t what I had dreamed of. I had wanted to make it all on my own. I had wanted to prove myself. Back at college I had always been so much better than all of those idiots, and now they would sneer at me, when I came crawling back. So shameful. So humiliating. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen. I was so much better than all of them…\n\nAnd yet this was how it had to happen. I had no other option. Unless… \n\nI licked my lips. The dopamine was still lingering in my mind, causing a warm prickling feeling to spread through my entire body. My eyes darted down at the roulette table. If I got lucky just one more time, I could have everything I ever wanted and more. It would be just like I had always dreamed. I would prove to them all how great I was.\n\nHope’s vision still danced fresh in my mind. I could still hear the laughter, could still feel the attentive eyes resting on me, could still taste the sweet wine on my tongue. I just needed to get lucky one more time. Just once more. One more gamble… \n\nOne more gamble… \n\nOne more gamble…\n\n\\-\n\nWhen the men broke down the door of my house I had already hidden down in the cellar. I could hear them stomp through the rooms above me. Glass shattered. Wood broke. They were wrecking everything, searching for any hints to my current whereabouts. The brutal noises were a frightening reminder of what they would do once they found me. I was listening to something even more terrifying though. Hope had started moving behind the metal door once more.\n\nIt had grown rapidly over the course of a single night. Its massive form slammed against the door. Caws and teeth dug into the metal, and then there were its screams… Those screams were the worst part of it. They sounded like a thousand voices twined together, shouting out in agony and death. \n\nHope screamed louder and louder. The walls shook from its attempts to break free. Any moment now the men upstairs would hear the sounds, and they would follow them down here to my hiding place. It was only a matter of seconds. And yet they never even reacted. It was as if I was the only one able to hear those screams. \n\nAt some point the hellish sounds died down. Hope stopped its enraged struggles, and the men above stopped trashing my apartment. They were all still there of course. Hope was still looming behind the iron door, gathering new strength, and the men were still up there, waiting for me to return.\n\nI could have called the cops, but that would only have delayed the inevitable. Instead I took out my tablet, and began composing my last message to the world. That’s where we are right now.\n\n\\-\n\nThings have been silent while I was writing - for the most part at least. Sometimes there are impatient footsteps above. Sometimes Hope stirs, and the screams start once more, and I push into the corner of the room, as far away from the door as possible, clutching my ears. It’s the most terrifying sound I have ever heard - a thousand overlapping voices crying out in agony, and the worst part is that they all sound exactly like my own.\n\nBut when I dare to crawl closer to the door - when I dare to press my eye against the spy hole - when I dare to actually look into the room - then I can suddenly see that there is nothing to fear. These are not my screams. They are the screams of my enemies. I can see it all so clearly whenever I look in there. The vision is so real. \n\nMy enemies run and cower and try to hide, and Hope walks among them, constantly shifting its form. One moment it takes the form of a majestic eagle with ebony talons, the next it is a black dog with rubies instead of eyes, then it is a giant man with skin of gold - and it takes anybody who dares to oppose me, and it slices them open, and it rips them apart, and it crushes them, and there I am right next to it, standing on a pile of their corpses - untouchable - victorious  - god-like…\n\nThat’s the vision I am shown whenever I peek into the room, and it could come true. It could all come true. It would be so easy. I just need to open this door. I just need to let Hope out, so that it can walk by my side, and protect me, and serve me…\n\nI have nothing left. I have no money to buy myself out of here. I have no friends who could help. I have no safe space where I could hide. \n\nI have nothing, but I still have hope. \n\nI still have hope, and I have the key to its prison.\n\n…\n\nOne last gamble…",

        "text": "Hey, sorry in advance since english isn't my first language. This happened a few days ago and I don't really know where else to share it.\n\nIt was around 7:30 PM and I got a message from a friend asking me to help him out with his garbage. I didn't really understand it at first but thought maybe there was too much trash and he needed my truck(?) He lives a few miles away from the city and needs to take his trash out by car to a common dumping area since the garbage truck won't go up to his house. He does this daily on his way to work.\n\nI arrived there about 40 minutes later and he was on his porch area smoking a cigarette with a blank expression on his face. We hugged since it was some time since we last saw each other, you know how life tends to get in the way. I lit up a cigarette as well and he started explaining why he wanted my help. He put the trash out the night before and was explicit that there was nothing out of the ordinary with it, he lives alone so there wasn't much trash, and it was new since he drove the old trash out to that garbage area in the morning. A few hours later, he was watching TV and got startled by some noises coming from the back of the house, where he puts his trash. He didn't want any wild animals going through it so he got up to scare it away. After a few steps he heard something akin to a cat meowing, so he figured it was one of his neighbor's cats, they don't live that close to each other but you can see his house from my friend's porch. I've never seen him, but I've occasionally seen cats around my friend's house, and he always said they were from that neighbor. Anyways, my friend really likes cats, so he started \"talking\" to the cat while walking to the kitchen, where the door to the back is. When he was arriving at the back door he bumped into a beer bottle that was on the counter and it crashed on the floor. He heard the cat screaming and when he opened the door he saw a dark shape dashing for the tree line. \"welp, he isn't coming back after that scare\" he said to himself as he was taking a look at the garbage. It looked normal and there weren't any apparent holes in the bags, so he went back inside, cleaned the glass from the floor, and threw it in the kitchen garbage. The next day he woke up and decided to empty his kitchen trash before taking it all to the dump area. As he opened his back door, the foulest stench hit his nose and he immediately started to gag. He threw the kitchen trash bag next to the others and closed the door. He immediately went to the bathroom to throw up and decided to deal with it when he was back from work. We've been having quite a lot of rain for the past few days, so he thought it would help with the smell. Hours later he arrives home, already forgotten about the smell. As he opened the kitchen door, he was hit again with it, and it all came back to him. The smell hadn't gone away, it had gotten worse, and was now inside his kitchen. He threw up on the floor, didn't have time to go to the bathroom this time. He decided to go around the house to see what the hell was wrong with his trash, and from afar, he almost puked for the third time, all the bags had holes in them, and there were maggots all around. He ran back to the front of the house, and thought a bit about it, how was it possible for the fresh garbage to be in that state after just one day? Doesn't really matter, he just needed it fixed, so he sent me the message and didn't leave his porch.\n\nThis friend was startled really easily, he always jumped when watching horror movies, so I thought that maybe he was exaggerating a bit about the smell and the maggots, maybe it was rice from a bag that spilled onto the others when the cat was going through them the night before. We finished our cigarettes and after a deep breath, he opened his front door and we got inside. The living room had no smell at all, making me confident that it wasn't that bad. \"Actually, don't want to go around the house? I think the kitchen is unbearable right now\". \"Don't worry, man, let's see if there's anything wrong with the kitchen first, and then we can go around if need be\". Boy, how was I wrong. He opened the kitchen door after a few seconds holding the door handle and gestured for me to go inside, as he got out of the way holding the door open. 1, 2, 3, and on the fourth step I froze, I could feel my nose, my mouth, my throat, everything burn with the most horrible smell I've ever felt. It remembered me of one time when I was a child, and I and a few friends were riding our bikes through my uncle's property, but this time we went further than we ever had before. We came across a small house next to the woods and decided to knock, because I was sure that at this point we were no longer on my uncle's land, and we wanted to get permission to ride around there. As we rounded the house to get to the door, there was none, the place was abandoned and filled with animal carcasses. There was rotting flesh, bones, and flies everywhere. The air was heavy and humid and the smell unbearable. We got to our bikes and booked it back. Even that smell, rotten animals, blood, and death itself, couldn't come close to what I was feeling at that moment. I held my breath and ran back to the leaving room, shutting the door behind me. My friend looked at me with that \"I told you so\" look, and we started thinking about how to make it easier. The plan was to spray air freshener on some masks and wear smaller bags as gloves. After we prepared ourselves, we went out to go around the house. It was dark, so we couldn't see that much, we also couldn't turn that light on since the switch was in the kitchen, and no way in hell any of us would go in there again before getting rid of that smell.\n\n We approached the garbage area and I help up my flashlight to get a better look. I was immediately struck with horror. That couldn't be normal, no way. I've seen garbage before, I've seen dumps before, but nothing came close to that. There were maggots all over the bags, their movement making the tiny reflections flicker. It was like looking at the night sky, pitch black from the bags combined with glistering white dots. I could see my friend press his mask to his face, hoping that the lavender smell could prevent him from throwing up. Our eyes squinted, it was involuntary, we could feel a little burn sensation and the tears coming. I put the flashlight between my neck and shoulder and held a new big garbage bag open while my friend tried to lift one of the rot-infested bags to put it inside the new one. He was trying to hold in places where there were no maggots or holes, but there were no empty areas to hold onto, as he tried to lift it, brown liquid started oozing from the holes. You could see several white dots falling into the dark pool that had formed under the bags, it was like sprinkling sugar into a black coffee. He managed to get a good grip on the bag, and I held my bag open for us to secure the trash, but as he was slowly lowering his bag, it started coming apart. To our luck, most of it fell into the new bag. We couldn't handle any more of the smell at that point, so we decided to take a break and ran back to the porch. Keep in mind that this ordeal couldn't have lasted more than 30 seconds. We took out our masks and started smoking our cigarettes, trying to get that awful odor out of our respiratory systems. \"Fuck it\" I said, my friend looked at me with terror in his eyes, I think he thought that I was going to leave him to deal with it alone. I took another hit off the cigarette and looked at him, \"Here's what we are going to do\", he listened intently, \"I'm gonna park my truck back there, we are gonna throw the bags on the back as fast as possible, just trying to now destroy them and spill everything. After that we will drive to that dumping zone and take everything out\", his eyes glowed with hope, and that's what we did, that part was still horrible and we almost threw up a lot, but this is getting too long and I still have things to tell.\n\nAfter driving to the dumping zone and back, my friend took a hose and we cleaned the back of my truck, we also tried to wash away the area where he kept his trash, it was concrete, so it all came out after some cleaning products and a lot of water. After that, we sat in his back area and started smoking again, I've never seen him more relieved, and to be fair, I was really relieved as well. There was still some odor in the air, but nothing close to whatever the hell that was before. We were discussing how bizarre it was, and with the light on this time, I was looking around the area and could see what looked like a path on his back lawn, it was surrounded by dying grass. I asked him what that was. He didn't know, so we went to have a closer look. It was a pathway of dead grass from his trash area to the woods. I held the flashlight up to it and could see what looked like paw prints on the wet soil, it looked like it was from a cat, but bigger, not much, but enough to make it weird. The weirdest part, however, was that every print was mirrored. Imagine if put your foot on the dirt, then turn 180 degrees on your heels and press your foot down again. I've never seen anything like that. My friend said it was probably from his neighbor's cat, and that he came and went through that same path so the prints were overlayed on each other. I think that's highly unlikely since all prints we saw were like that, how would he step over all of his past prints? And how do we explain the trash being in the state that it was after only one day, with nothing out of the ordinary inside it? Or the weird rotten path formed from this house to the woods? Do you think that cat thing had something to do with the rotten garbage or was it attracted to it?\n\nI know this isn't all that scary and is more on the nasty side, but thinking about it all gives me the creeps. I can't seem to get that smell out of my nose and mouth, I've tried it all. My friend for some reason doesn't want to talk about this with our other friends, and I also don't understand that. Am I supposed to forget about the weird cat and rotten garbage? How? I can still smell it, I don't think I'll forget it that soon.",

        "text": "This happened in late October of this year and I have been living in fear since then.\n\nI had been sitting at my desk for what must have been a couple of hours just staring at my computer screen hoping the words would find their way to my fingers but it was looking hopeless by that point.\n\nThis happened to me with every book. I would sit down and type the words Chapter One and then blip! Any idea I had planned on writing would disappear.\n\nUsually, it would only plague me for a day or two and then these ideas find their way back to me and I could crank out a solid first draft in a couple of months, but this time those couple of months had already come and gone and still I was stuck on page one.\n\nTo say I was frustrated would be an understatement. I had a publisher that was getting stingy with advances, an editor who was getting impatient with my lack of progress and I had myself struggling to remove the invisible dam within my brain so that I could give everyone waiting with their hand out something to shut them up for a while.\n\nLittle did I know, as I sipped my third beer of the afternoon, that my frustration would soon turn to torment.\n\nA small nugget of inspiration hit me - a chapter title. \n\nChapter One: Istanbul in a China Shop. I liked it - well, didn't hate it. \n\nIt was on brand with my usual international espionage tripe and it wasn't a blank screen, so I put it in the win column.\n\nThen the clank started.\n\nA loud metallic noise had begun hammering at random but constant intervals from somewhere beyond the walls of my house. I tried to drown it out with some music, something I rarely used while writing, but I had to stop this insidious noise before it completely derailed my train of thought.\n\nNo use.\n\nThis noise just kept coming, echoing across my fragile creative thread.\n\nI rose from my desk and listened for the direction it seemed to be coming from and followed it out of the study, down the hall and out my front door to the porch where a chilly October day caught me off guard.\n\nI folded my arms and rubbed my shoulders as the clank grew louder.\n\nI live on a large parcel of land that backs onto a forest on one side and faces a small lake on the other. The only other building on the land, other than my house, garden shed and pool house is a small two-bedroom bungalow that sits facing mine, just shy of my property line.\n\nThat house has stood empty for the fifteen years I have lived here and who knows how many before that, so when a strange noise inexplicably starts clamouring here in the middle of nowhere, I tend to take notice.\n\nBut as I stood staring at the tiny bungalow across the shared driveway the clank stopped.\n\nI stood there a moment longer, convinced that it would start again and I would find its origins somewhere around that tiny house. Instead, there was silence - welcomed, calming silence.\n\nI went back inside and sat back down at my computer, that train of thought still, thankfully, at the station.\n\nI etched out a couple of sentences to get things rolling when the clank came back.\n\nI bolted to the front door, determined to solve this mystery and get on with my life but as I threw the door open I was met by a man standing on the steps of my front porch.\n\nSurprised to see someone standing there I stopped dead in my tracks somewhere half in and half out of my front doorway.\n\nIt's at this point that I think I should explain that I suffer from some pretty debilitating social anxieties and it takes a lot for me to even make a phone call to someone I'm close with, so when I opened the door and found a complete stranger standing less than three feet from me, these anxieties took a savage hold of me and was not letting go.\n\nThe man was still, his hands folded in front of him, fingers clasped together across his belly. His stature was slight and his clothes hung from his frame as they were slightly too big. His manner was unassuming and unthreatening and at first, I thought he might be from the church. This wouldn't have been the first time the church had sent someone to save my soul or whatever other bullshit they always justified invading my privacy over.\n\nBut then I met his eyes and immediately I was struck by a fear had never felt before, a fear that was primal.\n\nSomewhere I read a statistic that the average person encounters 16 murderers in their lifetime and while I remember at the time thinking that was a bunch of bullshit, I certainly believed it on this day.\n\nStaring up at me from behind a pair of thick-rimmed aviator-framed glasses were a pair of blue eyes so pale they were almost gray. On any other person though, these eyes would be remarkable, intoxicating, beautiful even, but on this man, they were the devil incarnate and they were looking through my very soul.\n\nGoosebumps ran straight up my spine as he stared at me unflinching. His round but gaunt face held a mild demeanour that stood in hard contrast against those God damned eyes.\n\nIt took me a moment to compose myself and he seemed content to wait until I did.\n\nI stepped out onto the porch, despite the voices in my head advising me of doing so. Still, I maintained a safe distance from this mysterious visitor, greeting him, albeit awkwardly, I'm sure.\n\n\"Uh, hi-hello.\" I said, trying to keep my voice from quivering, \"Can I, uh - Can I h-help you with something?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" He replied, \"I wonder - \" He paused pulling his glasses from his face to clean them with a blue and white checkered handkerchief he produced from his trouser pocket.\n\n\"Could you tell me when your neighbour will be home?\" He finished, sliding his spectacles back on and shifting his gaze directly at me again, not blinking once.\n\nMy first instinct was to run. Just get the fuck out of there and pray I never have to look into this man's eyes ever again but reason got the better of me and I managed an answer.\n\n\"I, uh, my neighbours?\" I stammered, \"Oh I don't - No, no one lives there.\"\n\nI was sweating. It was 43 degrees outside and I was sweating. My chest was tightening. I was praying this would soon be over.\n\n\"Ah,\" He smiled, those eyes brimming with fire and brimstone, \"My mistake.\"\n\nWith that, he nodded, turned to the house across the lane for a moment and then left.\n\nI about-faced and scrambled through the door, slamming it behind me and bolting it tight. I had never locked my door in the fifteen years I had lived here but you can bet your ass I locked it after that interaction.\n\nI needed a drink.\n\nI moved to the kitchen, peering out each window on the way, paranoid that the Son of Sam or whoever the fuck that was would be peering back at me but it seemed he had indeed left.\n\nI sat down in the sanctity of my living room to calm my nerves and settle the disquiet - the dread that had me in its grip. A couple of  Xanax and a few shots of Jameson did the trick.\n\nWhile I still couldn't get those awful eyes out of my mind, I was able to reflect on the day's events and not induce a heart attack.\n\nWhere did that sound come from? Better yet, where did *he* come from? I didn't see a car in the laneway and it's a mile out to the main road - surely he didn't walk it.\n\nSoon my visitor had drifted to the back of my mind and I sat back down at the computer ready to get some solid pages down by the end of the day. Then it returned - the clank.\n\nI hadn't heard it since before Satan himself showed up at my door but now it was back.\n\nIt started quietly at first but quickly ramped up to its strange haphazard rhythm.\n\nI sat there hoping it would stop on its own like it did earlier but no luck this time, it kept going and going and going and going and going - fuck!\n\nThe light outside had started to wane as the overcast clouds grew darker and the sun began to sink behind them. I peered out the front window across the driveway to the bungalow.\n\nIt sat dark and ominous, staring back at me, that damned clank still... well, clanking!\n\nI realized I was starting to obsess over this noise and I pulled myself away from the window, gaving up on any work progress for the day.\n\nI settled in on the couch, the clank still present, and turned on the TV.\n\nI woke to darkness throughout the house except for the TV. Sports highlights played on the screen and I checked the time.\n\n3:03 am.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and grabbed the remote, clicking the television off.\n\nThe house fell into a quiet blackness... a quiet - what? It was gone! The clank had gone!\n\nI shuffled off to bed feeling the effects of the several whiskeys I had downed earlier.\n\nI was asleep before my head even hit the pillow. The day's events had left me emotionally exhausted but sleep didn't offer me a reprieve, not in the least.\n\nThat night I dreamed of him, the man that visited me.\n\nI wandered the rooms of the house across the lane despite never setting foot inside in the waking world. \n\nAn omnipresent malevolence that could have only been the churchman with the devil's eyes constantly stalked behind me from room to room.\n\nEach doorway I passed I could feel those soul-splitting eyes watching me as I fumbled for a way out of the tiny home, disappearing when I would turn to look directly at them.\n\nEver present was the clank, now louder than I had heard it before hammering away from somewhere inside that house.\n\nWhile didn't see him yet I knew he was there. I could feel his evil gaze burning into my back at every turn, that small, tiny home becoming an endless maze of nicotine-stained walls and stilted floors.\n\nIt felt like I would never escape and every second felt like my last until my alarm pulled back into the safety of the real world.\n\nDaylight flooded my room, the alarm blaring from my phone. I turned it off and rubbed my eyes to clear my blurry vision only to be met with the clank reverberating around what seemed to be everywhere.\n\nI couldn't go through another day of this. I was already horribly behind on all of my deadlines and I couldn't afford any more delays. \n\nI had to find the cause of this noise and I had to stop it.\n\nAfter a quick shower, I dressed and headed to the front door.\n\nI opened the door and stepped outside where a blanket of fresh snow had fallen overnight. I halted my gait at the alarming sight of tire tracks leading along the driveway to the bungalow's garage.\n\nFrom there I could see footprints all around the area, the snow around the garage door disturbed indicating it had been opened.\n\nMy heart was racing as I stepped to the edge of the porch for a better view. There, on the steps of my porch, were more footprints. They lead from the tire tracks at the neighbouring garage and stopped halfway to the front door.\n\nPanic took over and I searched for the closest thing to a weapon that I could find. A tiki torch I had forgotten to take in at summer's end would have to do.\n\nA circled my house twice, searching for any evidence that this intruder had tried to gain entry to my home but found none. The footprints only lead to my porch. That was enough though.\n\nI grabbed my car keys and headed into town where I bought cameras to cover every angle of the outside of the house.\n\nI spent the rest of the day installing them, my paranoia increasing with each passing moment.\n\nI was sweating again but not from anxiety. The temperatures of the day was rising and soon that thin veil of snow had melted away.\n\nThat night as I checked the cameras obsessively, I realized I had forgotten about the clank. I hadn't heard it since that morning. I couldn't hear it at all anymore. \n\nStrangely, this brought a sense of comfort to me, so much so that I even got a few pages done on the book.\n\nThings were starting to feel normal again but as I made myself a late dinner, a notification chimed on my phone.\n\nA camera I had placed at the side of the house facing the bungalow captured some movement.\n\nI opened the camera app and clicked on the camera in question to review the footage but I hadn't enabled it to record.\n\nShit. \n\nI clicked around to all of the other cameras and didn't see anything out of the ordinary which meant only one thing. I had to go and check it out myself.\n\nIt was at that moment that the clank decided returned.\n\nThis brought with it my anxiety and all of its sketchy friends and I spent the better part of an hour hyping myself up just to step outside the door.\n\nOnce out there, the cool October air filled my lungs giving me a bolt of freshness that helped me take that first step away from the safety of the front door.\n\nThe clank continued, louder now.\n\nI clung to a golf club I had brought for safety just in case whoever was here last night came back and as I approached the corner of the house I paused, steadying my breath.\n\nOnce I felt a little more in control of my faculties I rounded the corner, phone light leading the way and nine iron cocked back over my shoulder.\n\nNothing was there.\n\nI searched the windows for signs of tampering or attempted entry but thankfully they were untouched.\n\nI was beginning to think this was all in my head, that maybe I was overreacting but as I looked down to the ground I realized my fears were very founded.\n\nFootprints ran along the side of the house on the mud-soaked ground. They approached from the bungalow across the lane, ran the length of my house and lead back to where they started.\n\nMy chest tightened as my heart raced. A chill ran up my spine as I suddenly found myself walking toward the neighbouring house, the steady noise from the clank getting louder with each step. \n\nI was beyond any apprehension now, at my wit's end. I had to make this stop and make it stop that instant, but halfway to the shack I stopped, my legs unwilling to move any further.\n\nCall the police, the voice in my head demanded and I ultimately obliged.\n\nRight then and there I dialled the police explaining the circumstances of my call and within about half an hour, there were three cruisers in my driveway and six cops going over the property.\n\nI waited on the front porch, praying they would find something to calm my very rattled nerves and when one of the officers approached me informing me their search turned up nothing I thanked them and slinked back into the house to lick my emotional wounds.\n\nThe clank echoed through my brain as I wondered how the police could have turned up nothing suspicious. If only they had heard the - wait - the clank. It had stopped when the police arrived. Then right on cue, as the last car left, it started again.\n\nI ran to the front door and looked out the window toward the bungalow, the clank persisting - scratch that - insisting I go over and investigate.\n\nI took hold of the doorknob, ready to walk into what could only be my impending doom when my phone rang scaring the ever-living shit out of me.\n\nI looked at the display. My sister, Rachael.\n\nThe worst timing. She always had the worst timing. I answered anyway knowing that she would hound me all night if I didn't answer.\n\n\"Hey,\" I answered curtly, \"I'm a little busy, what's up?\"\n\n\"Nice to hear from you, too, asshole.\" She snarked back.\n\n\"I said I was busy,\" I replied, still too curt for her liking.\n\n\"Never mind.\" She said, obviously hurt by my tone.\n\n\"Rachael,\" I sighed, my tone changing, \"I didn't mean anything by it, I'm just - I'm busy.\"\n\n\"I'll keep it short then.\" She bargained. \"Are you still on for helping your niece with her history homework tomorrow like you promised?\"\n\n\"I'm - yeah,\" I stammered having completely forgotten about that promise, \"Yeah, of course, I will. I'll send you a Zoom link later tonight.\"\n\n\"You're not going to flake on her like last time?\" Rachael jabbed, hitting me right in the feels.\n\n\"That was one time,\" I argued, trying to clear my conscience.\n\n\"You keep telling yourself that,\" she jabbed again, \"Asking Kit Paul to keep a promise is like fucking for virginity.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" I replied, genuinely impressed with the analogy, \"Mind if I steal it?\"\n\n\"She's free after 7:00 tomorrow night.\" Rachael chuckled, \"Don't let her down, Kit.\"\n\nThat last line stung as I'm sure it was meant to.\n\n\"I'll see you both tomorrow,\" I affirmed.\n\nWith that, the call ended. \n\nI stared at my phone for a moment, reflecting on all of the mistakes I had made with her, her kids, my family. I probably would have stayed there wallowing in it the rest of the night if it wasn't for the clank chipping away at what was left of my increasingly delicate sanity.\n\nI grabbed my golf club and headed for the bungalow.\n\nOpening the door, the night seems stranger now knowing that someone had intruded on the sanctity of my home, the venerableness of my world, the privacy of my thoughts.\n\nWithout hesitation, I made my way toward the house, its dark windows staring back at me lifelessly.\n\nThe clank continued and grew louder with each stride forward.\n\nI approached the garage and could immediately tell that this is where that infernal noise was coming from.\n\nI tried the door but found it padlocked, something I never knew to be the whole time I lived here. This wasn't an old weathered lock either, this was a brand new shiny heavy duty Yale lock that definitely wasn't there before.\n\nThe clank continued, now with more ferocity to its tempo.\n\nI looked around for something to smash the lock open with and realized the golf club I was holding would likely do the trick.\n\nI wound up, the clank hammering away at a fever pitch and promptly felt something strike the back of my head.\n\nEverything went black and when I awoke, it was the next evening. I was in my bed. I was in my pyjamas and in my bed but I had no idea how I got there.\n\nMy head was killing me as I lifted it from the pillows to see the clothes I was wearing folded neatly and placed on the bench that lives at the foot of my bed.\n\n\"Hello?\" I called out, my voice shakey.\n\nOn my bedside table, a bottle of Advil sat with a glass of water beside it.\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\n\"Hello!?\" I hollered once more.\n\nSilence. Not even the clank was clattering.\n\nMy phone rang.\n\nStartled, I grabbed for it, knocking the pills to the floor. I got ahold of the phone and pulled it into view.\n\nMy sister.\n\nI checked the time. 7:30? How?\n\nWait - homework - shit!\n\nI answered.\n\n\"Hey, I'm just signing in,\" I stalled, \"Give me five.\"\n\n\"You forgot again, didn't you?\" She said sounding hurt.\n\n\"Not at all,\" I lied, \"Just give me five minutes.\"\n\nShe hung up.\n\nI got my shit together and logged into the Zoom call I promised my niece I would be available for. \n\nAfter a few moments of grovelling to my sister, I began helping my niece with her homework.\n\nShe was learning about morse code, something I had researched thoroughly having written spy novels my whole career, so I felt I could be a pretty big help and maybe bit of a hero in the process.\n\nWe had gotten to some of the emergency patterns used in Morse Code when it hit me as she sounded out the S.O.S. pattern.\n\nThe clank was not some random tapping, it was a cry for help - an S.O.S.\n\nI made up some bogus excuse to end the call early and bolted out of the house.\n\nFresh tire tracks ran the length of the driveway straight to the bungalow's garage which now had its door standing halfway open.\n\nI ran over to the garage, finding the padlock on the ground among more footprints and some drag marks.\n\nI crouched down and ducked into the garage, hoisting the door open some more to let my porch lights shine into the gloomy concrete box.\n\nThere on the floor lay an old metal pipe, one end covered in dried blood and chunks of what looked to be scalp judging from the hair pressed into the blood. \n\nThe floor of the garage had chunks chipped out of it from where the pipe had been striking.\n\nOn the inside of the garage door streaks of bloodied hand prints and scratch marks smattered the aluminum.\n\nI called the police were called again and this time I found a forensics team and over a dozen of county sheriffs all over my house, the bungalow and the property surrounding it.\n\nA few hundred feet from my back door where the yard meets the woods they found a girl. \n\nI learned from the news a couple of days later that she was naked, bound by an old phone cord, her nails and hands chewed up from trying to claw her way out of that garage. She was blindfolded, her tongue had been cut out so she couldn't scream and she was gagged. A pair of industrial ear protectors had also been duct tapped to her head so she has no idea where she was.\n\nI gave a description of the mysterious visitor I had encountered a couple of days prior and I knew that as I described him to the forensic artist, I knew that that monster knew. He knew I would give his description, that I would rat on him.\n\nIt is now the last day of the year and still, no one has been arrested in the kidnap and murder of that poor girl.\n\nI have lived in fear ever since that day. I fear for the day that monster I met on my front porch returns. I fear for the day he comes back and I fear for the I hear a clank coming from the empty house across the lane.",

        "text": "“Woo! Taxidermy!” My friend Ollie shouted excitedly, clapping his hands together and collapsing into a rickety old wooden chair next to the workbench. I folded my arms on the back of the chair I was standing behind, then proceeded to rest the side of my head on top of my arms. The sun from the open doors of the shed behind me was beating on my back, making me hotter than I already felt. I gave Ollie a side smile and giggled.\n\n“You know how weird that sounds, right?” Ollie shrugged, pulling off his gloves and tossing them onto the workbench.\n\n“*You* know you like this stuff too, missy. And I can’t help but feel excited after finishing a long job like this. Look at the final product! She’s perfect!” Ollie responded, gesturing toward the workbench with wide open arms and beaming his crooked teeth at the taxidermy rabbit standing proudly on top of it. I shifted my head so that my chin was now resting on my arms and observed the rabbit myself; it was really impressive. We had only been practicing taxidermy for a few months at that point, and this was only the fourth time we did it without the help of my dad.\n\n“It’s pretty cool,” I said. I felt a sense of pride radiate in my chest. I’ll admit, this was the first project me and Ollie had completed on our own that I was actually proud of. There weren’t any wonky parts, no visible stitching or blood spots on the fur. I couldn’t help but break a small smile when I thought of showing it to my dad later.\n\n“She’s a beaut,” Ollie mused, gazing longingly at the taxidermy rabbit with his arms folded across his chest. I snorted a laugh.\n\n“‘She’?”\n\n“It’s like a boat or a car. You call something you're proud of ‘she,’ right?” I shook my head, smiling at him.\n\n“You’re so corny.”\n\n“Love ya too, April.” He grinned widely at me, chuckling at his own comedy.\n\nHe was truly the corniest person I’d ever known, but he was my best friend, so I loved him nonetheless. He was one of those guys that I couldn’t see myself getting close to if I had met him, say, yesterday. But practically being raised as siblings and constantly living close to each other had sort of forced us to get along, and it worked well, to say the least. Seven years later and here we were, practicing a hobby we both had become invested in together during the weekend before we had to return to the horrors of 10th grade. I had other friends at school, of course, but I just felt this sort of connection with Ollie that was different compared to everyone else. It really did feel like he was meant to be my brother, but something happened in the timeline that kicked him out of my family tree. At least we were in each other's lives, I guess. I just wish things could return to normal like they once were before everything went to shit.\n\nAnyway, once the job was done and we had finished reveling at our creation, we decided to head back inside my house and wash up. I was the first to get to the kitchen sink, so I flipped on the water and began to wash my hands, scrubbing them real hard to get all the germs off of them. As much as I liked taxidermy, I was still freaked out by how many germs resided on the dead animal. While I washed my hands, Ollie walked over to the fridge and ripped it open, whistling to himself. He stood for a second before letting out an excited “Aha!” and diving behind the fridge door.\n\n“You didn’t tell me you got more lemonade!”\n\n“I didn’t want you drinking it all,” I said, smirking to myself.\n\n“Ha ha, real funny. I’m not gonna drink it all,” he responded, stepping back out from behind the door, the gallon bottle of lemonade in his hands. It must’ve been heavy, because he was using both hands to hold it against his chest as he hobbled over to the counter next to me.\n\n“I’m surprised you still want to drink lemonade after the 4th of July party a few months ago.” I started laughing as I remembered what went down then. Ollie grimaced, shaking his head.\n\n“Yeah. Dark times. I’ve learned not to down six cups of lemonade in the span of ten minutes anymore. I’ve matured,” he said, sounding mildly proud of himself. He reached up and grabbed a cup from the cabinet, having to stand on his tiptoes to reach the inconveniently high handle.\n\n“You’re gonna make yourself sick again right now if you drink before washing your hands. All those germs are gonna get into your system,” I said, flicking the water off my hands into the sink before reaching for the roll of paper towels. I left the water running so that Ollie could go ahead and use it. He stepped over to the sink and waved a dismissive hand at me.\n\n“You’re such a worry wart. A little dirt won’t kill me,” he said, drenching his greasy, stained hands in the water. His skin had been ever so slightly tanned from the sun, but it was mostly burned from his lack of sunscreen.\n\n“Dirt might not, but grime from the nasty fur of a dead animal might,” I said, shoulder-checking him as I walked past to the trash can, tossing my bundle of used paper towels into it.\n\n“I wore gloves for a reason. So did you. Gloves repel dirt, yeah?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, whatever. My hands are clean now, see?” Ollie showed me his wet hands as he turned the water off by knocking the faucet handle with his elbow.\n\n“Good job. You want a cookie?” I cooed sarcastically. He decided to get back at me by flicking the water from his fingers at me, sprinkling me in cold droplets that made me squirm. I laughed as I flailed my arms in front of me to protect myself from his attack.\n\n“Nah, I want lemonade,” he said, drying his hands off quickly and launching the paper towels into the garbage as if he were throwing a basketball. “Score!” I clapped for him, laughing even harder now.\n\nAs Ollie poured himself a cup full of lemonade, I noticed a large black figure in the distance zoom through the sky from the window above the sink. I looked up and realized that it was a massive vulture, its black wings flapping in authority as it landed on the roof of an old, grey, seemingly rotting house that stood just behind the few trees on the hill that separated it from my backyard. Soon after, another vulture came fluttering down from the opposite side.\n\n“Ugh, they’re back,” I said. Ollie paused his drinking and looked through the window with me.\n\n“Ew, I hate those things. They’re so creepy. They also eat all the things we could’ve used to turn into a great taxidermy piece,” he said. He shook his head disapprovingly and took another sip of his drink, then his eyes went wide with a revelation. He slammed the cup down, somehow managing to keep any of it from spilling. “April! What if we went inside that house and tried to find the dead animal before they could? Maybe a vulture even died in there and we could take it back to your shed and turn it into taxidermy! That’d be sick!”\n\n“That’s not part of my property, idiot. We’d be trespassing.”\n\n“Does someone really live there?” I looked back at the building, noticing that another vulture had landed on the edge of an open window, looking inside at the eerie darkness. I furrowed my eyebrows and tilted my head in thought.\n\n“Uh, well, I don’t think anyone lives there. I think it’s just part of the neighbor’s property. Kinda like my shed.”\n\n“But that thing’s, like, three times the size of your shed. Have you seen anyone actively try to make it not look like shit?” Ollie grabbed the bottle of lemonade and made his way over to the fridge, putting it back in the place it was before.\n\n“Well, no—”\n\n“Then it’s definitely abandoned! The neighbor guy probably wants it torn down, anyway. At least we’d be giving it some purpose. So what’s the harm in exploring a bit?”\n\nI decided to bite my tongue and stop arguing with him. If there’s one thing about Ollie that I had to say I hated, it was how damn persistent he was. If he found something he wanted, he would go to incredible lengths to get it, willing to sacrifice himself and his dignity without batting an eye. I pressed my lips together and sighed heavily through my nose as he returned to his spot next to me.\n\n“Fine. We’ll go for a few minutes, but then we absolutely have to leave.”\n\n“Are you scared or something?” Ollie asked, placing his empty cup into the sink and leaning his back against the counter.\n\n“That neighbor has a shotgun that he uses to scare off intruders. So yeah, I’m scared of getting shot,” I said, emphasizing the word “shot” so that he would understand how serious this was. All he did was shrug.\n\n“Then let’s not get caught, alright?” He gave me a sly smirk and a slight nod before he pushed himself off the counter and walked over to the backdoor. “We leave at sundown. Gather your swords, your steeds, and your strongest men, for we are about to embark on a journey of great peril!” And with a villainous laugh, he opened the door and strutted out to the backyard.\n\nI rolled my eyes, giggling to myself. But my mind immediately snapped back to the situation at hand. How were we supposed to sneak inside that decaying house without the neighbor noticing? What if we ended up breaking something and the neighbor finds out about it? What if we get some sort of disease from all the mold that’s most likely filling the place? Or tetanus from anything rusty just haphazardly laying around? I felt my heartbeat start to pick up with anxiety and I heard a loud bang on the window next to me. I nearly jumped out of my skin, but when I looked at the window and saw Ollie standing outside waving at me, my fear was replaced with annoyance. I banged on the window right where his face was, causing him to stumble backward, laughing. He motioned for me to come outside with him, so I did.\n\n“We’re not leaving right now, are we?” I asked, panic beginning to set in.\n\n“No! No, not now. When it gets dark we can head out. That way it’ll be easier to sneak in. And it won’t be so damn hot,” Ollie explained, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. He ran his fingers through his shoulder-length shiny brown hair, each loose curl falling back into place once he finished. He looked back at me, a few curled strands falling in front of his eyes. “I feel like a wet dog right now.”\n\n“You look like one, too,” I teased.\n\n“And you look like the backside of a baboon with how sunburnt your face is,” he said, stuffing his hands into his pockets before he turned on the heels of his feet and started backing away. “You clearly can’t stand the sun.”\n\n“What, do you wanna start airing out the dead animals inside the shed? Make the whole place stink up?” I asked, following him.\n\n“No, I’m good, actually.” He turned around and continued walking, and it only occurred to me then that we were walking up the hill toward the house. I stopped in my tracks.\n\n“What are you doing? I thought you said we weren’t going until tonight.\" He turned around to look at me.\n\n“I know, I’m not going inside the place. I’m just scouting out the area around it. Get a lay of the land, ya know?” I paused, bending sideways slightly to peer around Ollie at the house. The vultures were still perched on the roof and window of the building, idly shifting their wings as they sat in wait. Just looking at it gave me the creeps and, despite the beaming sun, I felt a chill roll down my spine.\n\n“You have fun. I’m gonna stay clear of that hell hole until it’s time to go.” Ollie shrugged.\n\n“Suit yourself. I’m not gonna go too far, just gonna get a basic view of the building. Might try and find good spots to slip in through.”\n\n“Alright. I’ll be inside, trying to cool down my baboon face,” I said, spitting out the last couple of words with playful agitation. Ollie let out a hearty laugh.\n\n“Alrighty, ass-face. I’ll meetcha there. I’ll tell you what I find around the spooky vulture house,” he said, drawing out the last part in a ghostly manner. I chuckled, then turned around and headed back to my house.\n\nIt didn’t take too long for Ollie to come back, maybe about ten minutes. I was sitting sideways on the couch, looking through a magazine while a standing fan was blowing directly on my face. Despite it being incredibly hot both outside and inside, the side of my face closest to the fan was now covered in a numb chill from the air blowing on it. I heard Ollie come through the back door from behind me and dipped my head over the side of the couch just in time to see him round the corner.\n\n“Welcome back, Mr. Adventurer,” I said. Even though he was upside down for me, I could notice his smile and eye roll. He walked up to me and slapped my forehead before taking a seat next to me on the couch. I sat up straight again and watched him as he spoke.\n\n“Wasn’t much of an adventure. There wasn’t anything too interesting outside the building. Just some crates and vines. I did find a way in, though. There’s a window towards the back that’s completely broken. The frame is gone and everything! I’ll have to get on your shoulders to get to it, though.”\n\n“Um, no,” I said, closing my magazine and tossing it to the side onto the coffee table. “I’ll be getting on your shoulders. It’s the gentlemanly thing to do.”\n\n“Sorry to burst your bubble, April, but I’m not the classiest man in the world,” Ollie said, gesturing to himself. His jeans were spackled with mud and his grey t-shirt was wrinkled and dusty. He had a hoodie tied around his waist that smelled like smoke from a campfire. Just looking at him, you’d expect him to have a thick country accent saying that he used to live on a cow farm, but he was actually from the city. I don't know how he turned out the way he did, but I liked it.\n\n“Whatever. We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,” I said, side smiling.\n\n“Indeed we will. The sun is setting evermore into the evening, and that is when we will roam!” Ollie said, crossing his legs and gesturing dramatically.\n\n“Are you a poet or something?” Ollie shrugged.\n\n“You could say that. All those poems in English class are starting to get to my head.”\n\n“I’ll say. Wanna watch some TV while we wait for nighttime?”\n\n“Sounds good.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what we did. We channel-surfed and watched whatever caught our interest for a few hours, occasionally getting up to bring snacks over to the couch. By the time the sky started to darken from a deep peachy color to an inky blue, more adult TV shows were coming on and the couch was littered with chip crumbs. Ollie groaned and stretched his arms and legs, then scratched the back of his neck.\n\n“I really should’ve taken a nap,” he complained. “I’m beat.” I couldn’t help but let out a cackle.\n\n“Beat from what? We’ve been sitting down for hours now!”\n\n“I worked my ass off to be entertaining for you during that time, didn’t I?” Ollie said, resting his elbows on his knees and holding his face up with his hands, looking at me with a sly smirk. I rolled my eyes and clapped a hand down on his shoulder, pushing on him to raise myself up from the couch. He grunted as he sank lower into the couch.\n\n“Let’s just get this over with, alright? My mom and dad should be coming home soon, and I don’t wanna get caught being out of the house.” I glanced at the clock that sat next to a window on the wall next to me. The time was 10 o’clock on the dot. My parents worked really late, being surgeons and all that. We still had to act fast, though. We had anywhere from thirty minutes to two hours to explore, and I had no idea which it was gonna be.\n\n“You’re right, April. You’re very right. Let’s go!” Ollie said, hopping off the couch and marching towards the backdoor. I followed him quickly and let him lead the way to the house.\n\nThe hill was steep and the grass crunched under our feet as we walked, each sound sending a fearful chill down my spine. I felt like I was being watched as we reached the top of the hill. I walked on my tiptoes behind Ollie as he not-so-quietly made his way to the window he found earlier. He stopped directly under it and gazed up at the abyss it led to. He huffed a laugh to himself, then looked over at me.\n\n“You wanna go in first?” He whispered. I didn’t even try to hide my shock and let my eyes bulge wide open.\n\n“Hell no! Absolutely not! Are you insane?” I whispered back, being as aggressive as I could without raising the volume of my voice. Ollie laughed inaudibly, propping one hand against the wall of the building and cradling his stomach with the other.\n\n“Thought you said you wanted to get on my shoulders to get inside, though!” I paused, my mouth hanging open with an invisible retort. I closed my mouth and sheepishly looked away from him.\n\n“I changed my mind.”\n\n“Thought so. Okay, I’ll get on your shoulders so you can help lift me inside. It’s really freaking dark in there, so we’re gonna have to try not to trip on anything.” He let out a gasp and snapped his fingers. “Shit! We should’ve grabbed a flashlight!” He smacked his forehead with the palm of his hand and groaned, clearly annoyed. “Ugh, I’m so stupid.”\n\n“I can grab one from my house. It’ll take me, like, two minutes. Do you want me to help you through the window before I go?”\n\n“That would be great, actually. I could start scouting out the first floor while you grab that.”\n\n“Alright,” I said breathily, immediately realizing how terrible of an idea this was. I walked over to him. “Please don’t die in there while I’m gone.”\n\n“That’s a promise I will probably be able to keep,” he said, pointing at me with a smile. I scoffed and pushed him lightly, then kneeled on the ground, facing the house.\n\n“Alright, get on.”\n\nOllie started off by sitting on my shoulders, instructing me to stand up so he could get closer to the window. The window itself wasn’t a crazy distance from the ground; in fact, once I was standing up with him on my shoulders, he was able to lean against the bottom of the window with his belly. Still, he wouldn’t have been able to crawl in without my help, and I wouldn’t be able to without his either. He took a moment to look around inside the dark building, murmuring a quiet “Woah.\" Meanwhile, I could feel my shaky knees starting to buckle underneath the weight.\n\n“Can you hurry up? I’m gonna collapse if you don’t get off me in the next few seconds,” I pleaded.\n\n“Hold your horses, April. You’re just weak. Don’t think I couldn’t hear you grunting and groaning trying to stand up. You almost toppled over. I could’ve gotten really hurt!” I risked letting go of one of his legs to punch him in the side, making him squirm. Him moving almost sent me crashing into the ground, but I somehow managed to keep myself upright.\n\n“Whatever. Just get inside already.”\n\n“Got it, chief.” Ollie shifted his legs and eventually was standing on top of my shoulders. I could feel his feet digging into my collarbones, and when he finally pushed off to jump through the window, I was almost certain they were going to crack and break. Luckily, I remained uninjured, and when I looked up I saw Ollie pop up through the window with a toothy grin. “I’m in!” He whisper-shouted, flashing a thumbs up. I could barely see him, but the light from the moon that was somewhere in the sky helped illuminate him a bit. I nodded.\n\n“‘Kay, I’ll be right back.”\n\n“Be quick. I’m scared of the dark.”\n\n“Pfft, yeah right.” I turned on my heels and made my way back down the hill, graciously taking the opportunity to distance myself from the creepy house for a few minutes.\n\nI was able to find two flashlights, which was good. The bad thing is that retrieving said flashlights took way less time than I anticipated, and before I knew it I was already back up the hill, watching Ollie flick some decayed wood flakes off the glassless window frame. I stood directly under him and tossed the flashlights one at a time to him. I couldn’t help but be surprised when he caught them both effortlessly and tucked them into his jeans pockets. He sighed, then leaned over the edge of the window, his hair drooping down over his head and bordering his face like a curly wall.\n\n“So what’s the plan now? How’re you gonna get up here?”\n\nI clicked my tongue and looked to my sides, squinting in the darkness to see if I could find a rock or something to stand on. I noticed off to my right that something was peeking from behind the house; I could tell by the texture of the object the moonlight was illuminating that it was some sort of wooden crate. I pointed towards it, a triumphant smirk playing on my face.\n\n“That’s my way in.” I looked back up at Ollie. “You’re gonna have to pull me the rest of the way, though.” Ollie nodded and saluted me.\n\n“You got it, chief.”\n\nI made my way over to the crate, taking careful tip-toeing steps over dried leaves and pebbles. Once I got to the side of the house, I noticed that there were several other crates lined up against the backside of the building. There was also a strange smell being emitted from them, one that I couldn’t quite place. I guess it smelled… old? Musty? Anyway, I reached down and grabbed the crate, and was startled by the weight it had when I lifted it. I could definitely carry it, but it drooped low down past my waist due to its heft. I placed it down as quietly as I could, then stood on top of the crate and raised my hands towards Ollie. He could easily grab my forearms from where he was now, so he grabbed my arm as low down as he could and hoisted me up. I held onto his upper arm and climbed up the side of the house until my knees hit just below the window frame. Then, I lifted my leg up, feeling a stretching pain in my thigh as I flung my leg over the window and into the building. I let out a deep sigh and climbed the rest of the way in.\n\n“Way to go, Spider-Man!” Ollie whispered, panting as he flexed his fingers.\n\n“Yeah, thanks,” I responded, already worn out. I put my hands on my knees and looked around the room we were in.\n\nMy eyes had adjusted to the dark by now, so I was able to see a good bit of the room, starting off with the two chairs and table in the left-hand corner. The glow from the moon allowed me to see all the chips and holes in the wood, so there was no way that those chairs were actually usable. Off to my right on the other side of the room was the staircase and railing, which also didn’t look the most stable. It was difficult to see the actual stairs themselves, and I was only able to see the dark shadows molded vaguely into the shape of steps. They traveled upward towards more darkness that was blanketed by the decrepit ceiling. I took a minute to process the interior of the house before I voiced my opinions on it.\n\n“Ew,” I said.\n\n“What, you don’t think this looks like a 5-star hotel?” Ollie asked, grabbing one of the flashlights from his pocket and handing it to me. I stood up straight again and took it from him, flicking it on and squinting as light flooded the room. Turning on the light didn’t make me appreciate the place anymore, though. It looks just as disgusting and mold-ridden as I expected.\n\n“Not necessarily,” I said, panning my light around and taking another look at the bottom floor. I was able to see how truly nasty the place was. Moss was collecting in corners of the walls and I even saw some mushrooms poking out from cracks in the floorboards. And I know I’ve been using a lot of the same words or words that mean the same thing to each other to explain what the house is like, but I really don’t have any other way to describe it. It was just purely, one-hundred percent gross.\n\nOllie turned on his flashlight as well and looked around the place, making a quiet, drawn-out “eugh” sound. The moment he started walking, the entire floor began to creak and groan, and I immediately grabbed his arm to stop him from moving. He looked at me over his shoulder, his eyebrows furrowed.\n\n“What?”\n\n“The floor’s loud as hell, he’s gonna hear us!”\n\n“Let’s tiptoe then.”\n\n“That’s not gonna solve the floor problem, dumbass.”\n\n“Long steps. Watch this.” He freed himself from my grip and stretched his leg out far, practically leaping about two feet away from me. He did this a couple more times, and every time he landed, the floor creaked loudly, but he was already at the staircase. He held his arms out triumphantly. “Follow along, little duckling!”\n\nI rolled my eyes before I copied what he did, taking large steps towards the staircase. I cringed every time the floor creaked, but I made it to Ollie with no other issues. With that, we took the terrible-looking stairs up to the second floor, skipping one step at a time to shorten our time on them. I almost fell backward on the stairs when I heard a cacophony of wings flap as we neared the top. Ollie had to grab my arm and pull me forward so I didn’t fall and crack my head open. Rearing the edge of the floor to the second story helped me realize that the wings flapping was the sound of the vultures flying away, most likely due to them hearing us come up. I watched as their freakishly large bodies hurled off the window frames and into the night. Knowing those freaks of nature were gone gave me some solace about going to the next floor.\n\nThe second floor wasn’t much better than the first floor. It was any better, actually. If anything, it was worse, because there was a smell — no, a stench — permeating throughout the whole floor. It was way worse than the smell coming from the crates outside. It smelled rotten and moldy with a hint of animal shit. I covered my mouth and nose with my shirt and gagged.\n\n“You can say that again,” Ollie said, his voice strained. He pinched his nose with his free hand and walked further into the room. “Smells like someone’s decomposing grandma that only ate chewing tobacco blew up in here.”\n\n“I can taste the smell,” I said, swallowing back another gag. “It’s so sour and moldy.” As I said that, Ollie gave no effort in trying to stifle a retch, flinging his arm across his face and burying his mouth in the crook of his elbow. I gave him a back-handed slap on the shoulder. “You’re gonna freaking get us caught!”\n\n“I’m gonna throw up first, though,” he said, his voice muffled. “The taste hit the back of my throat. It didn’t help when you described it as fucking *moldy*.”\n\n“Jesus, language,” I murmured, walking past him.\n\nI quickly discovered that the awful smell wasn’t the only thing that made this floor worse than the first one. The more I walked into the room, the more random objects cluttered up the area, and not generic ones like the chairs and table downstairs. There was a deflated basketball hanging limply off the arm of a rocking chair directly under a window on the other side of the room. To my left and off in the far left corner was a pile of crates similar to the one I used to step on outside, except these were haphazardly covered with duct tape. There were also dozens of Zippo lighters, some open and some closed, scattered around and on top of the crates, my flashlight catching the glint from the metal of each of them as I scanned past them. Other random objects I found include a broken garden gnome, a few rusty knives, and a waist-height wooden cross leaning against the wall. What I did not find, however, were any dead animals.\n\n“There’s nothing here for us, Ollie,” I whispered, leaning close to his ear. “We need to leave.”\n\n“We don’t know that yet. We need to search the whole floor.”\n\n“I can see most of the room,” I said, beginning to get pissed off. I already felt like we had overstayed our welcome, and I was getting desperate to leave at this point. I really, really wish we did. But we didn’t, and instead, I briskly moved my light around the entire room, shining it from the ceiling above us to the floor below us. And as the light grazed across the floor underneath the windows the vultures were standing on, I realized why they were there in the first place.\n\nIt was silent for what seemed like an hour, an eternity, my heartbeat growing louder with every pulse. My throat grew dry as I started to take deep, panicked breaths. My eyes stung with tears that were about to fall but didn’t get the chance to before Ollie spoke up in a broken, barely audible voice.\n\n“An arm… that’s a fucking arm.”",

        "text": "“Woo! Taxidermy!” My friend Ollie shouted excitedly, clapping his hands together and collapsing into a rickety old wooden chair next to the workbench. I folded my arms on the back of the chair I was standing behind, then proceeded to rest the side of my head on top of my arms. The sun from the open doors of the shed behind me was beating on my back, making me hotter than I already felt. I gave Ollie a side smile and giggled.\n\n“You know how weird that sounds, right?” Ollie shrugged, pulling off his gloves and tossing them onto the workbench.\n\n“*You* know you like this stuff too, missy. And I can’t help but feel excited after finishing a long job like this. Look at the final product! She’s perfect!” Ollie responded, gesturing toward the workbench with wide open arms and beaming his crooked teeth at the taxidermy rabbit standing proudly on top of it. I shifted my head so that my chin was now resting on my arms and observed the rabbit myself; it was really impressive. We had only been practicing taxidermy for a few months at that point, and this was only the fourth time we did it without the help of my dad.\n\n“It’s pretty cool,” I said. I felt a sense of pride radiate in my chest. I’ll admit, this was the first project me and Ollie had completed on our own that I was actually proud of. There weren’t any wonky parts, no visible stitching or blood spots on the fur. I couldn’t help but break a small smile when I thought of showing it to my dad later.\n\n“She’s a beaut,” Ollie mused, gazing longingly at the taxidermy rabbit with his arms folded across his chest. I snorted a laugh.\n\n“‘She’?”\n\n“It’s like a boat or a car. You call something you're proud of ‘she,’ right?” I shook my head, smiling at him.\n\n“You’re so corny.”\n\n“Love ya too, April.” He grinned widely at me, chuckling at his own comedy.\n\nHe was truly the corniest person I’d ever known, but he was my best friend, so I loved him nonetheless. He was one of those guys that I couldn’t see myself getting close to if I had met him, say, yesterday. But practically being raised as siblings and constantly living close to each other had sort of forced us to get along, and it worked well, to say the least. Seven years later and here we were, practicing a hobby we both had become invested in together during the weekend before we had to return to the horrors of 10th grade. I had other friends at school, of course, but I just felt this sort of connection with Ollie that was different compared to everyone else. It really did feel like he was meant to be my brother, but something happened in the timeline that kicked him out of my family tree. At least we were in each other's lives, I guess. I just wish things could return to normal like they once were before everything went to shit.\n\nAnyway, once the job was done and we had finished reveling at our creation, we decided to head back inside my house and wash up. I was the first to get to the kitchen sink, so I flipped on the water and began to wash my hands, scrubbing them real hard to get all the germs off of them. As much as I liked taxidermy, I was still freaked out by how many germs resided on the dead animal. While I washed my hands, Ollie walked over to the fridge and ripped it open, whistling to himself. He stood for a second before letting out an excited “Aha!” and diving behind the fridge door.\n\n“You didn’t tell me you got more lemonade!”\n\n“I didn’t want you drinking it all,” I said, smirking to myself.\n\n“Ha ha, real funny. I’m not gonna drink it all,” he responded, stepping back out from behind the door, the gallon bottle of lemonade in his hands. It must’ve been heavy, because he was using both hands to hold it against his chest as he hobbled over to the counter next to me.\n\n“I’m surprised you still want to drink lemonade after the 4th of July party a few months ago.” I started laughing as I remembered what went down then. Ollie grimaced, shaking his head.\n\n“Yeah. Dark times. I’ve learned not to down six cups of lemonade in the span of ten minutes anymore. I’ve matured,” he said, sounding mildly proud of himself. He reached up and grabbed a cup from the cabinet, having to stand on his tiptoes to reach the inconveniently high handle.\n\n“You’re gonna make yourself sick again right now if you drink before washing your hands. All those germs are gonna get into your system,” I said, flicking the water off my hands into the sink before reaching for the roll of paper towels. I left the water running so that Ollie could go ahead and use it. He stepped over to the sink and waved a dismissive hand at me.\n\n“You’re such a worry wart. A little dirt won’t kill me,” he said, drenching his greasy, stained hands in the water. His skin had been ever so slightly tanned from the sun, but it was mostly burned from his lack of sunscreen.\n\n“Dirt might not, but grime from the nasty fur of a dead animal might,” I said, shoulder-checking him as I walked past to the trash can, tossing my bundle of used paper towels into it.\n\n“I wore gloves for a reason. So did you. Gloves repel dirt, yeah?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, whatever. My hands are clean now, see?” Ollie showed me his wet hands as he turned the water off by knocking the faucet handle with his elbow.\n\n“Good job. You want a cookie?” I cooed sarcastically. He decided to get back at me by flicking the water from his fingers at me, sprinkling me in cold droplets that made me squirm. I laughed as I flailed my arms in front of me to protect myself from his attack.\n\n“Nah, I want lemonade,” he said, drying his hands off quickly and launching the paper towels into the garbage as if he were throwing a basketball. “Score!” I clapped for him, laughing even harder now.\n\nAs Ollie poured himself a cup full of lemonade, I noticed a large black figure in the distance zoom through the sky from the window above the sink. I looked up and realized that it was a massive vulture, its black wings flapping in authority as it landed on the roof of an old, grey, seemingly rotting house that stood just behind the few trees on the hill that separated it from my backyard. Soon after, another vulture came fluttering down from the opposite side.\n\n“Ugh, they’re back,” I said. Ollie paused his drinking and looked through the window with me.\n\n“Ew, I hate those things. They’re so creepy. They also eat all the things we could’ve used to turn into a great taxidermy piece,” he said. He shook his head disapprovingly and took another sip of his drink, then his eyes went wide with a revelation. He slammed the cup down, somehow managing to keep any of it from spilling. “April! What if we went inside that house and tried to find the dead animal before they could? Maybe a vulture even died in there and we could take it back to your shed and turn it into taxidermy! That’d be sick!”\n\n“That’s not part of my property, idiot. We’d be trespassing.”\n\n“Does someone really live there?” I looked back at the building, noticing that another vulture had landed on the edge of an open window, looking inside at the eerie darkness. I furrowed my eyebrows and tilted my head in thought.\n\n“Uh, well, I don’t think anyone lives there. I think it’s just part of the neighbor’s property. Kinda like my shed.”\n\n“But that thing’s, like, three times the size of your shed. Have you seen anyone actively try to make it not look like shit?” Ollie grabbed the bottle of lemonade and made his way over to the fridge, putting it back in the place it was before.\n\n“Well, no—”\n\n“Then it’s definitely abandoned! The neighbor guy probably wants it torn down, anyway. At least we’d be giving it some purpose. So what’s the harm in exploring a bit?”\n\nI decided to bite my tongue and stop arguing with him. If there’s one thing about Ollie that I had to say I hated, it was how damn persistent he was. If he found something he wanted, he would go to incredible lengths to get it, willing to sacrifice himself and his dignity without batting an eye. I pressed my lips together and sighed heavily through my nose as he returned to his spot next to me.\n\n“Fine. We’ll go for a few minutes, but then we absolutely have to leave.”\n\n“Are you scared or something?” Ollie asked, placing his empty cup into the sink and leaning his back against the counter.\n\n“That neighbor has a shotgun that he uses to scare off intruders. So yeah, I’m scared of getting shot,” I said, emphasizing the word “shot” so that he would understand how serious this was. All he did was shrug.\n\n“Then let’s not get caught, alright?” He gave me a sly smirk and a slight nod before he pushed himself off the counter and walked over to the backdoor. “We leave at sundown. Gather your swords, your steeds, and your strongest men, for we are about to embark on a journey of great peril!” And with a villainous laugh, he opened the door and strutted out to the backyard.\n\nI rolled my eyes, giggling to myself. But my mind immediately snapped back to the situation at hand. How were we supposed to sneak inside that decaying house without the neighbor noticing? What if we ended up breaking something and the neighbor finds out about it? What if we get some sort of disease from all the mold that’s most likely filling the place? Or tetanus from anything rusty just haphazardly laying around? I felt my heartbeat start to pick up with anxiety and I heard a loud bang on the window next to me. I nearly jumped out of my skin, but when I looked at the window and saw Ollie standing outside waving at me, my fear was replaced with annoyance. I banged on the window right where his face was, causing him to stumble backward, laughing. He motioned for me to come outside with him, so I did.\n\n“We’re not leaving right now, are we?” I asked, panic beginning to set in.\n\n“No! No, not now. When it gets dark we can head out. That way it’ll be easier to sneak in. And it won’t be so damn hot,” Ollie explained, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. He ran his fingers through his shoulder-length shiny brown hair, each loose curl falling back into place once he finished. He looked back at me, a few curled strands falling in front of his eyes. “I feel like a wet dog right now.”\n\n“You look like one, too,” I teased.\n\n“And you look like the backside of a baboon with how sunburnt your face is,” he said, stuffing his hands into his pockets before he turned on the heels of his feet and started backing away. “You clearly can’t stand the sun.”\n\n“What, do you wanna start airing out the dead animals inside the shed? Make the whole place stink up?” I asked, following him.\n\n“No, I’m good, actually.” He turned around and continued walking, and it only occurred to me then that we were walking up the hill toward the house. I stopped in my tracks.\n\n“What are you doing? I thought you said we weren’t going until tonight.\" He turned around to look at me.\n\n“I know, I’m not going inside the place. I’m just scouting out the area around it. Get a lay of the land, ya know?” I paused, bending sideways slightly to peer around Ollie at the house. The vultures were still perched on the roof and window of the building, idly shifting their wings as they sat in wait. Just looking at it gave me the creeps and, despite the beaming sun, I felt a chill roll down my spine.\n\n“You have fun. I’m gonna stay clear of that hell hole until it’s time to go.” Ollie shrugged.\n\n“Suit yourself. I’m not gonna go too far, just gonna get a basic view of the building. Might try and find good spots to slip in through.”\n\n“Alright. I’ll be inside, trying to cool down my baboon face,” I said, spitting out the last couple of words with playful agitation. Ollie let out a hearty laugh.\n\n“Alrighty, ass-face. I’ll meetcha there. I’ll tell you what I find around the spooky vulture house,” he said, drawing out the last part in a ghostly manner. I chuckled, then turned around and headed back to my house.\n\nIt didn’t take too long for Ollie to come back, maybe about ten minutes. I was sitting sideways on the couch, looking through a magazine while a standing fan was blowing directly on my face. Despite it being incredibly hot both outside and inside, the side of my face closest to the fan was now covered in a numb chill from the air blowing on it. I heard Ollie come through the back door from behind me and dipped my head over the side of the couch just in time to see him round the corner.\n\n“Welcome back, Mr. Adventurer,” I said. Even though he was upside down for me, I could notice his smile and eye roll. He walked up to me and slapped my forehead before taking a seat next to me on the couch. I sat up straight again and watched him as he spoke.\n\n“Wasn’t much of an adventure. There wasn’t anything too interesting outside the building. Just some crates and vines. I did find a way in, though. There’s a window towards the back that’s completely broken. The frame is gone and everything! I’ll have to get on your shoulders to get to it, though.”\n\n“Um, no,” I said, closing my magazine and tossing it to the side onto the coffee table. “I’ll be getting on your shoulders. It’s the gentlemanly thing to do.”\n\n“Sorry to burst your bubble, April, but I’m not the classiest man in the world,” Ollie said, gesturing to himself. His jeans were spackled with mud and his grey t-shirt was wrinkled and dusty. He had a hoodie tied around his waist that smelled like smoke from a campfire. Just looking at him, you’d expect him to have a thick country accent saying that he used to live on a cow farm, but he was actually from the city. I don't know how he turned out the way he did, but I liked it.\n\n“Whatever. We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,” I said, side smiling.\n\n“Indeed we will. The sun is setting evermore into the evening, and that is when we will roam!” Ollie said, crossing his legs and gesturing dramatically.\n\n“Are you a poet or something?” Ollie shrugged.\n\n“You could say that. All those poems in English class are starting to get to my head.”\n\n“I’ll say. Wanna watch some TV while we wait for nighttime?”\n\n“Sounds good.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what we did. We channel-surfed and watched whatever caught our interest for a few hours, occasionally getting up to bring snacks over to the couch. By the time the sky started to darken from a deep peachy color to an inky blue, more adult TV shows were coming on and the couch was littered with chip crumbs. Ollie groaned and stretched his arms and legs, then scratched the back of his neck.\n\n“I really should’ve taken a nap,” he complained. “I’m beat.” I couldn’t help but let out a cackle.\n\n“Beat from what? We’ve been sitting down for hours now!”\n\n“I worked my ass off to be entertaining for you during that time, didn’t I?” Ollie said, resting his elbows on his knees and holding his face up with his hands, looking at me with a sly smirk. I rolled my eyes and clapped a hand down on his shoulder, pushing on him to raise myself up from the couch. He grunted as he sank lower into the couch.\n\n“Let’s just get this over with, alright? My mom and dad should be coming home soon, and I don’t wanna get caught being out of the house.” I glanced at the clock that sat next to a window on the wall next to me. The time was 10 o’clock on the dot. My parents worked really late, being surgeons and all that. We still had to act fast, though. We had anywhere from thirty minutes to two hours to explore, and I had no idea which it was gonna be.\n\n“You’re right, April. You’re very right. Let’s go!” Ollie said, hopping off the couch and marching towards the backdoor. I followed him quickly and let him lead the way to the house.\n\nThe hill was steep and the grass crunched under our feet as we walked, each sound sending a fearful chill down my spine. I felt like I was being watched as we reached the top of the hill. I walked on my tiptoes behind Ollie as he not-so-quietly made his way to the window he found earlier. He stopped directly under it and gazed up at the abyss it led to. He huffed a laugh to himself, then looked over at me.\n\n“You wanna go in first?” He whispered. I didn’t even try to hide my shock and let my eyes bulge wide open.\n\n“Hell no! Absolutely not! Are you insane?” I whispered back, being as aggressive as I could without raising the volume of my voice. Ollie laughed inaudibly, propping one hand against the wall of the building and cradling his stomach with the other.\n\n“Thought you said you wanted to get on my shoulders to get inside, though!” I paused, my mouth hanging open with an invisible retort. I closed my mouth and sheepishly looked away from him.\n\n“I changed my mind.”\n\n“Thought so. Okay, I’ll get on your shoulders so you can help lift me inside. It’s really freaking dark in there, so we’re gonna have to try not to trip on anything.” He let out a gasp and snapped his fingers. “Shit! We should’ve grabbed a flashlight!” He smacked his forehead with the palm of his hand and groaned, clearly annoyed. “Ugh, I’m so stupid.”\n\n“I can grab one from my house. It’ll take me, like, two minutes. Do you want me to help you through the window before I go?”\n\n“That would be great, actually. I could start scouting out the first floor while you grab that.”\n\n“Alright,” I said breathily, immediately realizing how terrible of an idea this was. I walked over to him. “Please don’t die in there while I’m gone.”\n\n“That’s a promise I will probably be able to keep,” he said, pointing at me with a smile. I scoffed and pushed him lightly, then kneeled on the ground, facing the house.\n\n“Alright, get on.”\n\nOllie started off by sitting on my shoulders, instructing me to stand up so he could get closer to the window. The window itself wasn’t a crazy distance from the ground; in fact, once I was standing up with him on my shoulders, he was able to lean against the bottom of the window with his belly. Still, he wouldn’t have been able to crawl in without my help, and I wouldn’t be able to without his either. He took a moment to look around inside the dark building, murmuring a quiet “Woah.\" Meanwhile, I could feel my shaky knees starting to buckle underneath the weight.\n\n“Can you hurry up? I’m gonna collapse if you don’t get off me in the next few seconds,” I pleaded.\n\n“Hold your horses, April. You’re just weak. Don’t think I couldn’t hear you grunting and groaning trying to stand up. You almost toppled over. I could’ve gotten really hurt!” I risked letting go of one of his legs to punch him in the side, making him squirm. Him moving almost sent me crashing into the ground, but I somehow managed to keep myself upright.\n\n“Whatever. Just get inside already.”\n\n“Got it, chief.” Ollie shifted his legs and eventually was standing on top of my shoulders. I could feel his feet digging into my collarbones, and when he finally pushed off to jump through the window, I was almost certain they were going to crack and break. Luckily, I remained uninjured, and when I looked up I saw Ollie pop up through the window with a toothy grin. “I’m in!” He whisper-shouted, flashing a thumbs up. I could barely see him, but the light from the moon that was somewhere in the sky helped illuminate him a bit. I nodded.\n\n“‘Kay, I’ll be right back.”\n\n“Be quick. I’m scared of the dark.”\n\n“Pfft, yeah right.” I turned on my heels and made my way back down the hill, graciously taking the opportunity to distance myself from the creepy house for a few minutes.\n\nI was able to find two flashlights, which was good. The bad thing is that retrieving said flashlights took way less time than I anticipated, and before I knew it I was already back up the hill, watching Ollie flick some decayed wood flakes off the glassless window frame. I stood directly under him and tossed the flashlights one at a time to him. I couldn’t help but be surprised when he caught them both effortlessly and tucked them into his jeans pockets. He sighed, then leaned over the edge of the window, his hair drooping down over his head and bordering his face like a curly wall.\n\n“So what’s the plan now? How’re you gonna get up here?”\n\nI clicked my tongue and looked to my sides, squinting in the darkness to see if I could find a rock or something to stand on. I noticed off to my right that something was peeking from behind the house; I could tell by the texture of the object the moonlight was illuminating that it was some sort of wooden crate. I pointed towards it, a triumphant smirk playing on my face.\n\n“That’s my way in.” I looked back up at Ollie. “You’re gonna have to pull me the rest of the way, though.” Ollie nodded and saluted me.\n\n“You got it, chief.”\n\nI made my way over to the crate, taking careful tip-toeing steps over dried leaves and pebbles. Once I got to the side of the house, I noticed that there were several other crates lined up against the backside of the building. There was also a strange smell being emitted from them, one that I couldn’t quite place. I guess it smelled… old? Musty? Anyway, I reached down and grabbed the crate, and was startled by the weight it had when I lifted it. I could definitely carry it, but it drooped low down past my waist due to its heft. I placed it down as quietly as I could, then stood on top of the crate and raised my hands towards Ollie. He could easily grab my forearms from where he was now, so he grabbed my arm as low down as he could and hoisted me up. I held onto his upper arm and climbed up the side of the house until my knees hit just below the window frame. Then, I lifted my leg up, feeling a stretching pain in my thigh as I flung my leg over the window and into the building. I let out a deep sigh and climbed the rest of the way in.\n\n“Way to go, Spider-Man!” Ollie whispered, panting as he flexed his fingers.\n\n“Yeah, thanks,” I responded, already worn out. I put my hands on my knees and looked around the room we were in.\n\nMy eyes had adjusted to the dark by now, so I was able to see a good bit of the room, starting off with the two chairs and table in the left-hand corner. The glow from the moon allowed me to see all the chips and holes in the wood, so there was no way that those chairs were actually usable. Off to my right on the other side of the room was the staircase and railing, which also didn’t look the most stable. It was difficult to see the actual stairs themselves, and I was only able to see the dark shadows molded vaguely into the shape of steps. They traveled upward towards more darkness that was blanketed by the decrepit ceiling. I took a minute to process the interior of the house before I voiced my opinions on it.\n\n“Ew,” I said.\n\n“What, you don’t think this looks like a 5-star hotel?” Ollie asked, grabbing one of the flashlights from his pocket and handing it to me. I stood up straight again and took it from him, flicking it on and squinting as light flooded the room. Turning on the light didn’t make me appreciate the place anymore, though. It looks just as disgusting and mold-ridden as I expected.\n\n“Not necessarily,” I said, panning my light around and taking another look at the bottom floor. I was able to see how truly nasty the place was. Moss was collecting in corners of the walls and I even saw some mushrooms poking out from cracks in the floorboards. And I know I’ve been using a lot of the same words or words that mean the same thing to each other to explain what the house is like, but I really don’t have any other way to describe it. It was just purely, one-hundred percent gross.\n\nOllie turned on his flashlight as well and looked around the place, making a quiet, drawn-out “eugh” sound. The moment he started walking, the entire floor began to creak and groan, and I immediately grabbed his arm to stop him from moving. He looked at me over his shoulder, his eyebrows furrowed.\n\n“What?”\n\n“The floor’s loud as hell, he’s gonna hear us!”\n\n“Let’s tiptoe then.”\n\n“That’s not gonna solve the floor problem, dumbass.”\n\n“Long steps. Watch this.” He freed himself from my grip and stretched his leg out far, practically leaping about two feet away from me. He did this a couple more times, and every time he landed, the floor creaked loudly, but he was already at the staircase. He held his arms out triumphantly. “Follow along, little duckling!”\n\nI rolled my eyes before I copied what he did, taking large steps towards the staircase. I cringed every time the floor creaked, but I made it to Ollie with no other issues. With that, we took the terrible-looking stairs up to the second floor, skipping one step at a time to shorten our time on them. I almost fell backward on the stairs when I heard a cacophony of wings flap as we neared the top. Ollie had to grab my arm and pull me forward so I didn’t fall and crack my head open. Rearing the edge of the floor to the second story helped me realize that the wings flapping was the sound of the vultures flying away, most likely due to them hearing us come up. I watched as their freakishly large bodies hurled off the window frames and into the night. Knowing those freaks of nature were gone gave me some solace about going to the next floor.\n\nThe second floor wasn’t much better than the first floor. It was any better, actually. If anything, it was worse, because there was a smell — no, a stench — permeating throughout the whole floor. It was way worse than the smell coming from the crates outside. It smelled rotten and moldy with a hint of animal shit. I covered my mouth and nose with my shirt and gagged.\n\n“You can say that again,” Ollie said, his voice strained. He pinched his nose with his free hand and walked further into the room. “Smells like someone’s decomposing grandma that only ate chewing tobacco blew up in here.”\n\n“I can taste the smell,” I said, swallowing back another gag. “It’s so sour and moldy.” As I said that, Ollie gave no effort in trying to stifle a retch, flinging his arm across his face and burying his mouth in the crook of his elbow. I gave him a back-handed slap on the shoulder. “You’re gonna freaking get us caught!”\n\n“I’m gonna throw up first, though,” he said, his voice muffled. “The taste hit the back of my throat. It didn’t help when you described it as fucking *moldy*.”\n\n“Jesus, language,” I murmured, walking past him.\n\nI quickly discovered that the awful smell wasn’t the only thing that made this floor worse than the first one. The more I walked into the room, the more random objects cluttered up the area, and not generic ones like the chairs and table downstairs. There was a deflated basketball hanging limply off the arm of a rocking chair directly under a window on the other side of the room. To my left and off in the far left corner was a pile of crates similar to the one I used to step on outside, except these were haphazardly covered with duct tape. There were also dozens of Zippo lighters, some open and some closed, scattered around and on top of the crates, my flashlight catching the glint from the metal of each of them as I scanned past them. Other random objects I found include a broken garden gnome, a few rusty knives, and a waist-height wooden cross leaning against the wall. What I did not find, however, were any dead animals.\n\n“There’s nothing here for us, Ollie,” I whispered, leaning close to his ear. “We need to leave.”\n\n“We don’t know that yet. We need to search the whole floor.”\n\n“I can see most of the room,” I said, beginning to get pissed off. I already felt like we had overstayed our welcome, and I was getting desperate to leave at this point. I really, really wish we did. But we didn’t, and instead, I briskly moved my light around the entire room, shining it from the ceiling above us to the floor below us. And as the light grazed across the floor underneath the windows the vultures were standing on, I realized why they were there in the first place.\n\nIt was silent for what seemed like an hour, an eternity, my heartbeat growing louder with every pulse. My throat grew dry as I started to take deep, panicked breaths. My eyes stung with tears that were about to fall but didn’t get the chance to before Ollie spoke up in a broken, barely audible voice.\n\n“An arm… that’s a fucking arm.”",

        "text": "I am an inspector detective in London and this is the story of how I became interested in the paranormal. I hope I won't get fired if I share this information.\n\nNonetheless, I won't share any specific details regarding the exact locations of some places, just in case. Anyway, it was my own boss who told me that I should write things out of myself to feel better, so here we are.\n\nMy first case took place years ago when I got a phone call from my supervisor CDI Brown and he asked me to investigate the crime scene in Eppling Forest, where some hikers had stumbled across a corpse.\n\nAs soon as my conversation with the chief detective inspector began, it was clear this wouldn't be a typical case. He spoke in an unnaturally tense and urgent tone, something I had never heard from him before. His usually cool demeanour was replaced with a sense of foreboding.\n\n'Something happened in that forest. Something that I am not sure how to deal with,' he noted.\n\nI knew something sinister was about to happen.\n\nWe arrived at the forest in two unmarked police cars, with a convoy of officers on board. It was night time and there was an eerie sense of darkness that seemed to engulf the surroundings. The trees were tall and thin, their branches swaying gently as they swayed under the wind's caress. We could only guess what mysteries lurked underneath them; it felt like something out of an old horror movie, but we had no choice but to press forward into this unknown land.\n\nAs we traversed deeper into Eppling Forest our steps grew heavy as if weighed down by its oppressive atmosphere - no matter how dimly lit or loud our lights shone, it seems that fear still managed to permeate through all else until eventually even sound ceased altogether - nothing rose above its dense silence except for perhaps a few hushed whispers from some unseen presence watching us explore further inside… I half expected creatures such as dragons or monsters emerging from behind tree trunks any moment now yet strangely enough everything remained eerily calm during these explorations -- almost too calm.\n\nEventually, after several minutes of cautiously stepping forward, we arrived at the crime scene which was already surrounded by a few hikers who had discovered the body. The area was disturbingly quiet and a chill ran down my spine as I saw what remained of this person's corpse. The details were gruesome; the naked body had grown into the thick trunk of a tree as if it was being merged to become part of its own vegetation. The limbs were still intact although they seemed distorted and bent in unnatural ways from the force that inflicted them - leaves had sprouted from their once human fingers and roots seemed to have taken over most parts giving off an air of tragedy instead. Whatever creature did this must be incredibly powerful for it to have such control over nature itself.\n\nMy mouth hung open in disbelief and I gasped. I felt my knees tremble and my throat tighten from the sudden shock of what I'd just seen. \n\n'Oh my God!' was all I could manage to say at that moment.\n\nWe quickly cordoned off the area and after collecting all relevant evidence, sent out teams throughout Eppling Forest with instructions not to leave until any trace or clue was collected. The deeper mystery eluded us even hours later however; what kind of being could possess such power? Its presence still haunted me till this day - I couldn't help but wonder what secrets may remain hidden deep within Eppling Forest.\n\nThe hikers who found the body were a young couple and the girl was crying on a rock. His boyfriend tried to give her some comfort, but his efforts fell short as she held back tears of fear and terror. I gave her a blanket in an attempt to help console her - no one should have had to experience such tragedy while out enjoying nature's beauty; something must be done about this soon before any other harm is brought upon Eppling Forest. The rest of us simply looked at each other with dismayed expressions - we were all just as frightened by what lurked beneath these woods yet powerless against them.\n\nI turned to Mary, a crime scene investigator with a background in natural sciences. 'What do you make of this?' I asked.\n\nShe stepped closer, her eyes wide with disbelief as she surveyed the landscape. She ran her hand through her hair and shook her head.\n\n'I've never seen anything like it,' she said in awe. 'At first glance, I'd say we're dealing with an unknown natural force.'\n\n'Where are his clothes? And what the fuck was he doing here naked?'\n\n'I have no idea,' Mary noted.\n\n'Now I understand why Brown was so reluctant to say more,' I remarked and decided to look around the area.\n\nThe moment I stepped away from the body, an eerie feeling came over me. The air was still and heavy, almost too calm - as if some unexplainable force had silenced every living creature in Eppling Forest. Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves and with gun firmly held in my hands, I ventured out of the crime scene on my own to find something or perhaps even the source of this unknown power.\n\nMy keen eyes scanned everywhere around eating up any particular detail that may have escaped us while we were handling other matters at hand; scoured the ground for suspicious tracks using all available light sources yet found none nor did they lead anywhere else further down our path either; I clutched onto my gun tightly with each step forward now more attuned than ever before- determined discover what secrets these woods may hide.\n\nAs I continued onwards, the hair on my neck began to rise and a chill ran down my spine - there was something in here with us…something that we had been missing for far too long. I could feel it all around me, yet it remained invisible to our sight- like an intangible monster silently lurking within these woods waiting for its next victim.\n\nThe air suddenly got colder and cold sweat trickled slowly down my forehead as a gust of wind passed through me sending shivers throughout every inch of my body almost scared now more than I felt back at the crime scene earlier this night. Despite being increasingly afraid by each second, however, some inner instinct drove me forward towards unknown paths. Perhaps shouldering any fear while knowing one cannot turn back or not trying would be futile against such darkness always helps push mankind into dangerous adventures right?\n\nAs I reached a small clearing, I heard creaking noises from the bushes and I stopped. I scanned my surroundings with my flashlight but did not see anything except for the dark shadows of the trees and bushes. At first, I thought it might have been an animal But as the noises rose again, I stopped and focused my light on the shadows.\n\nSomeone was walking and the twigs were cracking underneath.\n\nI aimed my gun and pointed towards the noise. At that moment a young woman dashed from the shadows onto the clearing stopped and looked directly at me with large terrified eyes; her heaving chest rising in ragged breaths as she was now fully exposed to light - only then did I realize it wasn't an animal. Unable to even speak, she clearly seemed traumatized by whatever forces lurked in these woods.\n\nThe woman had a slim, pale frame with long dark hair and eyes that seemed to be filled with fear. Underneath her arms were tightly clenched as she stood in the clearing, her body trembling from the shock of being seen. Her clothes were tattered and stained from whatever she had endured until now, her hands shaking uncontrollably as she cowered before me.\n\nMy heart was racing now but my duty as an investigator prevailed - I had to find out why she was here in Eppling Forest, although something deep inside of me told me that it would have been better if we hadn't found her at all.\n\nI approached her cautiously, taken aback by her silence. She was trembling, her eyes vacant and glassy. Her clothes were tattered and muddy and she looked lost in a daze. “What happened, miss?” I asked in confusion, but she didn't answer; she seemed to be in a state of shock.\n\nI didn't want to put any pressure on her, so I wanted to make her feel comfortable. After surveying the area and realizing that I was closer to my car than to the crime scene, I suggested that we head there instead of backtracking and I had seen enough at the crime scene anyway.\n\nWe walked in silence until we reached my car and we both got in and drove off.\n\nAs we drove away from the crime scene, my thoughts were racing between the woman and what we had witnessed. I simply could not comprehend how a human body could be incorporated into a tree. Growing up, I was always reading science-fiction that touched upon time and space travel, but this was something entirely different. I wished that Mary could provide me with the answers I was looking for in terms of understanding the situation in a rational way.\n\nMy mind was racing. Did this woman have something to do with the murder? Or did she see something that nobody has ever before? She was clearly traumatised so something must have happened to her.\n\nI shifted in my seat, my eyes were fixed on the road.\n\n'So, how did you end up in the forest?' I asked awkwardly, my voice was cracking with nervousness.\n\n'You see, there was a terrible crime a bit further away where I found you. Did you witness anything unusual?'\n\nMy question was ridiculous. Of course, she witnessed something unusual otherwise she would not have been in shock. But I just wanted to open her up a bit.\n\nShe did not respond. Instead, she was looking out of the window, her eyes glazed with pain as if memories came flooding in. As much as I wanted to press for further details, something inside me told me not to.\n\nI have to tell you, there was something dark and mysterious about her, it seemed as if there were many questions left unanswered, which made me curious to know more - yet I found myself feeling an apprehension based on fear of what new information or secrets we would uncover during our investigation.\n\nAnyway, keeping discretion was my utmost priority in this case so instead of pushing her any further I decided it best just nod sympathetically and keep quiet for a while longer; allowing my colleagues time and space for whatever outcome awaited us both beyond that night.\n\nI called DCI Brown and told him about my finding.\n\n'All right Watts, take her in and we will find out what she knows. Jesus, I have never seen such a mess! See you at the station. We will have a long night.' he noted on and hung up.\n\nI could not agree more.\n\nWe finally were approaching the police station and I could feel my anxiety increasing. On one hand, I knew that getting her to the station was an integral step in finding more answers; on the other hand, it felt almost physically painful to be taking someone who had been through such trauma - no matter how desperately they needed help.\n\nThe woman's face was pale, her breathing shallow and rapid as I parked the car outside of the building. She turned to me, her eyes wide and imploring me not to leave her there. Her hands clutched at the edge of her seat as if clinging to a life raft, and she shook her head slowly, silently begging me to stay. Although her lips were pressed into a firm line, her fear was palpable, and it seemed like nothing would persuade her to step out of the car.\n\nQuickly, I thought of a plan. I killed the engine and told the woman 'Everything will be all right. Just wait a few seconds, I will be back,' and got out of the car, locked the doors and headed straight to the dining room of the station.\n\nAfter two minutes I found myself inside and with shaking hands, I prepared a cup of Earl Grey as quickly as possible - almost like an athlete pushing their body beyond physical limits in order to devote every ounce of energy into winning the race - hoping against all odds that it might help settle her down until DCI Brown arrived with his team shortly afterwards.\n\nSure enough, just as I exited the building, I saw police cars coming and there was my supervisor coming among them. However, I did not see the vans of the coroner and crime scene investigators which suggested that they were still out there collecting evidence and traces.\n\nI waited until the cars parked and DCI Brown got out of the car.\n\n'I am telling you, Watts, our government is in a huge mess if they are experimenting with secret military weapons,' he ran his fingers through his bald head as if he had had hair and he stopped to look at me, his eyes widened and full of worry.\n\n'What about the couple who found it?'\n\n'They went for a romantic walk when they came across the body. I think they have lifelong PTSD. Where is your witness?' he barked, his voice rising in pitch.\n\nI gestured with my head towards the direction of my car and started heading there.\n\n'Be careful boss, she is having a trauma,' I noted.\n\n'Don't worry about that, my wife is the same after having sex.'\n\nThen came the next shock that night. When we reached my car, I was amazed to find that the woman was no longer inside.\n\n'She was here in my car! Right here!' I said, pointing wildly at the empty passenger seat.\n\nAt first DCI Brown thought that maybe someone had taken her away but then again there were no signs or suspicious activities around so after an hour-long investigation – we concluded that she must have fled due to fear and apprehension; trusting none other than her own instincts perhaps more than anything else — nevertheless leaving us behind with a million unanswered questions and theories which only increased our worries.\n\nBut the question was, how? How did she get out of the locked car?\n\nThen something hit me. The cameras. The parking lot had a lot of cameras, so I suggested taking a look at the footage.\n\nWe arrived at the control centre and an officer ushered us inside. We were all standing nervously around a large flat-screen monitor as the officer was preparing the footage. Tension hung thick in the air, and I could feel everyone's racing heartbeats in sync as we waited to see what was hidden in the video.\n\nNothing.\n\nI was alone. All along. The camera at the entrance confirmed that there was nobody with me, no one on the passenger seat. Even when I pulled into a spot and parked, there was still nobody there. All the while, it felt like I was speaking to someone, but in reality, the car was empty.\n\nMy first thought was that I went crazy and that was the end of my career as a detective.  \n\n\nBrown said softly as he placed his hand on my arm in an attempt to soothe me. I jumped out of my chair and shouted, “That’s impossible! I’m not going crazy!” I could feel my heart pounding as my tight fists trembled at my sides.\n\n'Go home and try to sleep, we will continue the investigation tomorrow!'\n\nThat night, rest was a foreign concept to me as all I could think of was finding that woman. I lied to Brown and said I was going home, but in reality, I was walking the streets, stopping anyone who looked suspicious in the futile hope that it might be her.\n\nMy desperate wandering eventually led me home, exhaustion slowly taking hold of my body.\n\nThe next day I was like shit and I started the morning with two double espressos. I knew that I was going crazy if I keep trying to find that woman so instead of concentrating on her, I shifted my focus to the victim himself.\n\nI knew where I had to go.\n\nThe Crime Lab was as tranquil as ever. I couldn't understand why it had such a calming effect on me: maybe it was the dim lights, or maybe it was the utter stillness of the place. It seemed as though time had stopped, and no one was in any rush to get anywhere.\n\n'So what do we know about this person? Do we know who he is?' I asked Mary.\n\n'As you could see, he didn't have any IDs on him,' Mary said as he was setting a microscope.\n\n'Yeah but he has fingers to take his prints, doesn't he?'\n\n'Well, not entirely,' she said calmly.\n\nA furrow of worry appeared between my eyebrows as I asked, “What do you mean?”\n\n'He doesn't have prints,' she said.\n\nI shifted in my seat, my impatience growing. She held my gaze, her expression unreadable. I waited for her to elaborate. She did.\n\n'All his fingers were severely burnt. Whatever it cause, she was exposed to some very strong radiation. Look Watts! This is the most fucking weird case I have ever had and I have no idea what we are dealing with! The team is there, they are cutting out the tree and bringing the whole trunk into a police hangar. After the medical examiner and I examined it thoroughly, I can say more.'\n\nThat was enough for me.\n\nI thanked her, got out of there and headed back to the crime scene, despite Mary's protests. Something in my gut told me I had to be there and see first-hand what was going on.\n\nThe team was working tirelessly on removing the trunk of the tree and its root. It seemed impossible to remove such a monolith but they were doing their best efforts making it as if nothing could stop them.\n\nNow that it was daylight, I could make out the contours of the man in the tree, his eyes wide with terror. I was wondering what the last thing was that he had seen but I wasn't sure I really wanted to know.\n\n'Be careful with the body! It's crucial evidence!' someone shouted.\n\nThen a massive excavator - which I had no idea how could get there - was used to carefully remove the object from the ground and lift it out of the dirt.\n\nOnce the enormous root was uprooted, something on the ground caught our attention. We walked closer to investigate what it was. Slowly, it became clearer that the man wasn't the only victim there. Deep in the ground, there were the skeletal remains of a human being. They were laying there in plain sight and we completely missed them during our first inspection of that place. We were all stunned by what lay before us.\n\nThe trunk with the body and the bones was transported to the police hangar. Mary determined the number of strange injuries on the body: some of his ribs were broken, his tongue was torn out and he had some low level of radiation. These injuries just added more to the question until a truck driver called the police.\n\n'I have found a car near Eppling Forest on the side of the road. Its door is open and the car is empty,' he said.\n\nMy curiosity sparked and we immediately drove to the place he described. When we got there, I could see that it was indeed an empty car and it certainly looked like a crime scene. All of its windows were smashed, bits of glass scattered around in what felt like some kind of wild frenzy had taken place. From one glance at this vehicle's interior, you could tell something terrible had happened there; blood on the front seat, bent handles ripped off from somewhere else indicating violence or struggle between two or more people. Whatever transpired here must've been horrific for someone.\n\n'It seems that the driver suddenly stopped and run into the forest,' I concluded based on the skidmarks and the signs.\n\n'What the hell frightens someone to do that?' one of the officers asked.\n\nI couldn't answer that question. I opened the glove compartment and retrieved a driver's license. The name on the ID was Ben Hudson. It was obvious who it was even though the face of the man in the trunk was deformed a bit.\n\nBut why did he stop and run into the forest? I did a quick estimation in my head, the trunk was approximately a half mile from the car. The cuts and bruises on his face became evident and I  \nrealized that he must've been running through the woods at night. The branches must have smacked him in his face as he ran. But from who? Or what?\n\nI wanted to know more about this Ben Hudson. Back at the station, I checked if he had a criminal history. To my surprise, he did.\n\nIt turned out that Ben Hudson had a wife who went missing three years ago. The police investigated him thoroughly and took several items from his home as evidence; things such as clothing fibres and trace amounts of unusual chemicals that could have been used for nefarious purposes - but still nothing implicating him in any wrongdoing towards his wife's disappearance was found within this material evidence or anywhere else for that matter.\n\nMy search on the Internet found out that no one reported having seen him on the day she vanished nor did anybody report seeing anything suspicious near their home at the time; all leads turned up empty-handed every single time investigators followed them through with meticulous scrutiny.\n\nHowever, I was the kind of investigator who had always claimed nobody was innocent until proven. There were several ways to commit a crime and mislead everyone, including the police.\n\nAfter I read some more articles on his case, I was taken aback when I saw the image of his wife, Veronica. Without a doubt, I recognised her.\n\nBecause he was the woman who I took to the police station.\n\nI felt the blood drain from my face and my mouth went dry and I was rooted to my seat in absolute terror.\n\nI didn't read the results of the DNA analysis because I already knew whose skeletal remains they were under the tree.\n\nI didn't get surprised when the official results stated that he had brutally murdered his wife because I already had a guess.\n\nI didn't tell anyone the reason why he abandoned his vehicle and dashed into the woods, for I was aware that no one would have believed me.\n\nThe only question I still ask myself is what is worse? Being the victim of a brutal murder or being haunted for years until the forces of hell take revenge?",

First thing this morning, as I was getting suited up and ready to head down to the storage sheds near the old fire watch tower, I heard a knocking on the door to my cabin. Being in the middle of a closed national park in the heart of an Alaskan winter, you can imagine I don’t get very many visitors. About the only people I even see out here is my ranger buddy, Rick, and the guy who brings me fresh supplies every few weeks.\n\nRick has never just shown up at my door without calling on the radio first, and I know he’s had his hands full recently with a few separate incidents of missing hikers and one self-professed cryptozoologist, so I was surprised to hear his muffled voice calling my name through the locked door.\n\nWhen I opened it and ushered him inside, I saw immediately the concerned set to his expression. Without a word, he stepped over to the fireplace and warmed his hands in front of the freshly smoldering log I had just added.\n\n“Hell, Rick, you gave me a bit of a start,” I told him with a small chuckle, trying to lighten the air a little. Something was up, and I had a sinking feeling that it might have something to do with me.\n\nHe turned away from the fire and looked at me a long moment in silence before speaking.\n\n“I got a call last night, John,” he said. His face was creased with a frown. I couldn’t tell whether it was one of worry or muted anger, or maybe a combination of both.\n\n“Oh yeah?” I replied, trying to keep the tone as casual as I could.\n\nHe pulled the wool cap off his head and ran a hand over it, smoothing out his short, neatly trimmed hair. “Yeah, and so did a few other rangers, apparently.”\n\nI nodded and took a sip from my coffee, feeling more uncomfortable by the moment. “What about?”\n\n“What do you think? It was about you,” he said, pointing at me with his cap. “You’ve attracted someone’s attention with your little stories that you’ve been posting online.”\n\n“My stories? What stories?” I said evenly, feigning innocence. I hadn’t discussed these posts with Rick since I started updating them. Sure, we’ve chatted about the possibility of me doing some in the past, but I haven’t told him that I’d actually written them. As far as he knew, I was just blowing smoke.\n\nMy palms began to sweat, despite the fact that my cabin’s internal temperature was probably in the low-50’s, even with the fire in the hearth. I’d been so sure that there was no way the NPS, or the agency, or anyone else could figure out who’s been writing these posts. I didn’t stop to consider that they didn’t *need* to figure it out themselves – all they needed to do was to start poking around at the rangers in various areas. \n\nSee, there’s no way that anyone who wasn’t intimately familiar with this area could have identified it just by the details I’ve given – I’ve even made sure to change the names of the places and alter the descriptions of some of the events a little, just to try to make it that much more impossible for anyone to figure out exactly who or where I was.\n\nIn retrospect, my mistake was obvious; if *I* was trying to identify the source of these posts, I’d probably go directly to the rangers who knew the territory even better than I do. \n\nI made the mistake of thinking that my friendship with Rick was strong enough for him to look the other way, to cover my ass.\n\nSee, the *Witch’s Lodge* isn’t really known by that particular name around here – I just made that up as an alias for its real one – but I’m sure Rick would be able to identify it immediately by reading what I’ve written about it. The same goes for the other stories, too.\n\nAnd I’m also pretty sure that other rangers would be able to recognize them for what they really were as well, now that I’m really thinking about it.\n\n*Shit*. I fucked up good this time.\n\nOkay, so here’s the deal – there are things that happen out here, more than I’ve told anyone about. More than I was ever planning on alluding to in these posts. Things that *they* do out here.\n\nAnd things they definitely do not want anyone to know about.\n\nI thought I was being so clever by sharing this with you all and disguising the details enough that they couldn’t be deciphered and traced back to me. \n\n*Fuck!*\n\nRick tilted his head at me and gave me one of those looks that told me he wasn’t in the mood for any games right now.\n\n“You know the stories I’m talking about, John,” he said in a flat tone. “The ones that I’ve *told* you time and again were a bad idea. The ones that I *told* you were going to get you into trouble.”\n\nI tried to shrug it off, downplay it. “Hell, they were just a few stories on the internet, Rick. I was just having a little fun. It gets lonely out here, we go stir-crazy sometimes – you know that.”\n\n“Yeah, well these little *stories* have stirred up trouble for us both,” he said, setting his hat on the chair and turning away from me, back towards the fireplace. “They know who wrote them. They know who you are.”\n\nI just stood there in shocked silence, mouth hanging open as I stared at my friend’s back, sudden comprehension flooding my thoughts. My eyes grew wide.\n\n“You told them?” I asked, stunned. \n\nHow could I have been so naïve? Rick had a job to do – we all had jobs to do out here. We all had people we answered to.\n\nWe all knew the score.\n\nHe didn’t turn to face me, but I could see his head fall a little in resignation. His face was probably twisted up in frustration at my recklessness, at the position I’d put him in, if I had to guess. I hope there was a little regret there, too. I’d like to think that our friendship had been real enough.\n\n“What did you expect? That they’d just look the other way again? This isn’t the first time you’ve pulled this shit, John,” he said, glancing over his shoulder at me.\n\nI could see the darkness in his eyes in that brief moment, the resolve that had turned his features to stone, and I knew what was coming.\n\nThe crackling of the flames from the fireplace almost covered the quiet sound of a fastener being unsnapped, but not quite.\n\nHe was quick, but I had the advantage.\n\nBefore he even had the chance to spin around to face me, my magnum was out of its holster and thundering with unimaginable violence in the small confines of my cabin. The air filled with acrid smoke and the after-image of the muzzle flash glowed in my eyes, superimposed over the dim firelight.\n\nRick staggered to his left, his own handgun falling to the floor as he reached up to clench at the blackened hole in the chest of his jacket, which was now already growing red from the terrible wound beneath.\n\nHe looked up at me and I could see the realization in his eyes of what had just happened. He reached out to steady himself against the mantle, gasping for breaths that now had a horrible wet rattle to them.\n\n“I’m sorry, Rick,” I said, grabbing my pack from beside the door and slinging my rifle over my shoulder with trembling hands. “I screwed it all up. I’m sorry about all this.”\n\nHe didn’t hear me, though. He had slumped to the floor and now stared vacantly at nothing, his blood pooling and spreading from beneath him across the wooden planks. \n\nHe was gone.\n\nThat was this morning.\n\nI took off out of my cabin as quickly as I could and strapped my pack onto the snowmobile. Within a couple minutes, I was speeding along the northern trail, away from my cabin and in the direction of the decommissioned ranger station.\n\nI had killed my friend.\n\nHe would have killed me if I hadn’t acted first, I know. \n\nBut that doesn’t change anything. I’ve never used my gun to kill *anything*, man or beast. It was always something that was there if I needed it, like a security blanket, but I never really thought I’d have to pull the trigger on anything.\n\n*Fuck!* I’ve made a mess of this whole thing.\n\nI thought it was all over for me when I skirted a little too close to the edge back in Montana, but fortune had smiled on me and the powers-that-be decided to give me another chance then.\n\nThere wouldn’t be another pardon for me this time.\n\nI’m sitting here in the back room of the old ranger station. I’ve concealed my snowmobile around back, covered by a tarp and whatever snow I could throw over top.\n\nIt’s starting to snow again outside, so I’m hoping that my tracks will be obscured before too long. Maybe it will buy me some time.\n\nJust enough time to get some of this out there. To allow me to post some of the truth.\n\nI have no delusions about my capabilities. I’m just a caretaker – my training was cursory at best. I’m certainly no match for their teams. \n\nMy name – my *real* name – is John Wright. I do actually work for the US government, but not for the National Parks Service. At least, not really. I’m not going to name the organization that I work for, not because I’m afraid that they’ll find out – it’s too late for that now – but because their RAPTOR AI protocols will identify and censor this entire post before it has the chance to proliferate if I do. Once the post gets out and starts bouncing around to various servers, it’s much more difficult for them to make it go away.\n\nMy job here is mostly what I’ve told you – that part’s true. But that’s mostly just busy work; my cover, if you will. Primarily, I’m responsible for keeping an eye out for trespassers who wander a little too close to their facilities. \n\nOr things that have escaped from them.\n\nOr unintended by-products of whatever the fuck they’re doing in there. I don’t really know what goes on under the mountain and I’m sure I wouldn’t understand it even if I did.\n\nWhat I do know is that I’m pretty sure those cars that just appear out of nowhere, hundreds of miles from anywhere they have any business being, are from one of those by-products. \n\nThe *shades*? Hell, I don’t know – escapees, maybe?\n\nI don’t even know what I hope to accomplish by writing all this right now. Maybe it’s my way of trying to make it right. \n\nMaybe I just want to make sure there’s something left of me for anyone to remember. \n\nWhen I was posted here three years ago, I saw the entrance to the facility – it’s about ten miles from my cabin, bored directly into the base of a mountain. I have no idea how big it is inside or how many people are in there, but I know that there are a lot of big military helicopters flying in and out at the beginning and end of my seasons here. I assume they’re transporting researchers or equipment or whatever.\n\nIt just hit me that, if Rick had shown up at my door a half-hour earlier, I would have been just finishing my breakfast instead of fully geared-up and ready to head out the door for the day. I wouldn’t have had my holster strapped to my chest and I’m certain I’d be the one laying in a pool of my own blood right now.\n\n*Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.*\n\n*Concentrate, dammit!* I don’t have time for this.\n\nI don’t know what the communication protocol was that Rick was supposed to follow after he took care of me, but I assume someone was waiting for his report to confirm that I’d been silenced. I have to believe that, by now, they know something has gone wrong. \n\nThere’s probably a team at my cabin right now. It hasn’t been snowing long enough to cover my tracks, unfortunately, which means they’ll probably have no trouble figuring out which direction I took. It’s only a matter of time before they show up here.\n\nThen it’s all over.\n\nRight now, I’m typing this on my notebook computer and relaying it through the ranger station’s communication network. I’m surprised they haven’t locked down the firewalls yet. I fully expected to be completely cut off from the world when I got here. Small blessings, I guess. At least I can get this out there still.\n\nYou’ve probably gathered by now that most of the rangers around here aren’t what they seem, either. \n\nSome are, I think. But most are ex-military, special forces-types, recruited by the agency to provide security and make sure that the caretakers don’t go off the reservation, like I did. \n\nRick was that way. His real name is Mike, by the way. I won’t tell you his last name – I don’t want him remembered as anything other than a hero. I’m the one that fucked this whole thing up; he was just doing his job, fulfilling his sworn commitment. He was an honorable man, and that’s how I want him remembered.\n\nHeh. My nerves are starting to get the better of me – I just took a look outside because I thought I heard something. I don’t think they can get here this quickly, so I’m thinking it was just my imagination.\n\nLook, this isn’t something isolated to Alaska. They have research facilities all over the US. The last one I was at was in Montana, but I know there are others spread across the states. Wyoming, Texas, Kentucky, South Dakota, hell, they’re everywhere. They like to build them in national parks, especially those with huge areas of wilderness. It ensures a reasonable amount of privacy without drawing the sort of attention to it that places like Groom Lake and Cheyenne Mountain have done. Those two places are basically tourist attractions at this point.\n\nBut man, once they tried out Alaska, it was like they hit the jackpot! The whole area is so remote and uninhabited that they are virtually guaranteed isolation and secrecy to do whatever it is they’re doing in there.\n\nDid I tell you about the man I found once, half… integrated into a boulder? \n\nI don’t think so. \n\nHe was wearing a lab coat, but the only parts of him that were accessible were his right arm and shoulder and the back of his head. The rest of him was somehow inside of it, which was probably for the best. I’m sure he died pretty quickly.\n\nI called that one in and they had a team out there within an hour. I left once they arrived, but when I came back a couple days later, the whole boulder was gone, and the landscape had been made to look like it had never been there. I’m talking about a rock the size of a small house, just gone.\n\nThe bear story is true, by the way. The only difference is that it was *us* who covered the whole thing up. That one scares the shit out of me, because that *thing* is still roaming out here, somewhere. They never were able to find it – hell, they lost a dozen men just trying.\n\nSame story as the bears, by the way. We found the teams down near the runoff gully, just standing there, dead. You’ve never seen a nightmare until you’ve seen a dozen armed corpses just frozen in place. By the time we found them, they weren’t much more than gray skin stretched tight over skeletons, but there they stood, looking like some goddamn zombie army out of a horror movie.\n\nI saw it once, I think – the thing that did it. It was about the size of a tall, thin, man, but the shape was all wrong – the joints bent in strange ways and the head was something that reminded me of a praying mantis. It was covered in black and gray mottled skin that looked sort of like scales, but not quite. \n\nI don’t know. I’m just a caretaker.\n\nI came across it while out making my rounds one day. It was clamped onto the back of one of those big Grizzlies, arms and legs wrapped around it like it was some sort of monstrous insect or something. The bear was just standing there, making the most God-awful screams you’ve ever heard, like it was being burned alive or something. But it wasn’t moving, it was just standing there perfectly still while this thing did whatever it was doing – feeding on the bear, somehow, I guess.\n\nI hid behind a tree and nearly pissed myself. I thought for sure it was going to hear my panicked breathing and come for me next, but it didn’t. Eventually, the bear stopped making that terrible crying sound and went quiet. A few minutes later, this thing unwraps itself from around the Grizzly, takes a few steps towards a big pine tree, and just vanishes.\n\nOnly it didn’t really vanish. I nearly stepped out from behind the tree to take a closer look at the bear when I realized that I was still looking at that thing, only its *skin* had camouflaged itself perfectly into its background, taking on the exact coloring and pattern of the snow-covered pine. \n\nI mean, perfectly.\n\nThe only reason I was able to see it was because a part of it – one of its appendages, I think – was slightly protruding away from the tree. It was this break in the shape of the tree that caught my attention, and probably saved my life.\n\nI must have stood there for another hour before it finally took a step away from that tree, its surface returning to the black and gray splashes of color. When it moved, it was like a stalking spider, slow and deliberate, graceful and ungainly all at the same time. \n\nIt was a fucking nightmare, is what it was. It took a few steps closer to the bear, like it was trying to figure out whether this was some new prey or whether it was already used up. Like it had forgotten about it and was just looking for its next meal.\n\nAfter that, it glided on down the trail without a sound, thankfully in the opposite direction of my hiding spot. I waited another hour before daring to move an inch, and when I did, I hauled ass back to my cabin, locked the door, and radioed the whole thing in to Mike. \n\nThey sent a team out, but never found anything other than the bear, which they very quickly made disappear.\n\nWhile I’m sharing my sins, by the way, the real rangers, the ones that originally found the dead bears and reported it to the NPS - well, you won’t find them anymore. There were three of them that worked with the researchers, just like I said in my story, but a week after the researchers left, all three of those rangers somehow wandered off trail during a snowstorm and died of hypothermia.\n\nYeah, right. Hypothermia.\n\nYou’d think that the agency could at least use a little imagination when they came up with these stories.\n\nI know this whole thing took a sudden sharp right turn on you guys, and I’m sorry about that. I’m out of time, though – no more time for pretexts or lies.\n\nThe bottom line is, you’re better-off staying out of the parks. Go see a movie, go for a drive, play video games, whatever. I suppose even state parks are probably safe enough, but I wouldn’t chance it.\n\nThe shit I’ve seen. What they’ve done…\n\n…Okay, I’m pretty sure that wasn’t my imagination that time. \n\nTime to upload the post. If I’m mistaken and if I have more time, I’ll just send an update, but I want to make sure this gets out there before they stop it.\n\n [\\-John Wright – former Seasonal Caretaker at an Alaskan National Park](https://www.youtube.com/@dark_night_tales)",

It's a despicable, dishonest career and to this day I will always hate the fame and money people like Ed and Lorraine Warren got with this scam. Even if I do like their movies. During late nights when my brother Ronnie isn't working part time at Mooyah's we'll watch bad reality tv shows that involve mediums and debate if they're legit or not. I always win.\n\nApparently, Boston doesn't share my point of view.\n\nMadame Esmerelda was a tall, lanky middle aged woman with an obvious fake tan and red hair so poorly dyed the grey roots looked like they were waging war with it. She wore typical gaudy, chunky jewelry and flowey, layered clothes you'd expect from someone like her. She even wore ankle bracelets. Apparently, she worked with Boston every now and then, and while that should have made me believe she had at least a grasp on what she was doing...I found myself doubting it. She'd met us at the Denny's where I'd spoken to Boston three nights ago and when I walked in she was already going on about how she didn't like scruffy, who sat in his usual seat on the other side of the restaurant, very clearly able to hear her from where she stood at the front. The guy always made me feel uneasy but I honestly felt bad for him. There he sat, stained as usual, eyes bloodshot and bagged from a clear lack of sleep, a few bruises on his face, just trying to eat his damn meal while this crazy white lady was going on and on to Boston about how his 'Ka' was wrong and he was 'clearly dangerous, like a wild beast'.\n\nI made eye contact with scruffy and he almost seemed to smile when I rolled my eyes and gave him the universal gesture for *'this bitch crazy*'.\n\n\"Kid, there you are.\" Boston greeted me when he noticed my arrival. He'd made me stay home the last three days to try and recuperate from what we found in the alley. That poor woman. At least it gave me a chance to spend the holiday with Ronnie, he got me Pokemon ultra moon, the newest game in the franchise.\n\n\"I told you, my name is Libby.\" \"Well you should pick a new name to use.\" He replied, \"You don't want anyone we chase down to track you by your name, right?\" He had a point. \"I'll think about it. Shouldn't your friend be a little quitter if she's going to talk about someone in earshot?\" I gave the woman, who's name I didn't know at the time, a frown. One she returned. \"I am Madame Esmerelda, seer of the dead and the truth, tool for spirits to speak through and share their knowledge. And you are...Libby, it seems.\" She said my name with distain, and the feeling was mutual. Before I could react she reached out and grabbed my face, turning it this way and that, running her fingers along my cheekbone and jawline. I felt very uncomfortable. She even pulled my glasses away and held my eye open, staring into it. After giving a huff she let go, handing me back my glasses. \"There is nothing special about this girl. You should send her home before she gets too involved and hurt.\"\n\nWell that was a load of shit.\n\n\"Trust me, Esmerelda, I know what I'm doing with this one.\" Boston assured her. This woman was proving to have zero sense of personal space as she snatched one of my hands and held it palm up, dragging a long green nail across it. Frowning, she pulled my hand up closer to her eyes. A palm reading. I knew of them of course, nearly everyone knows of them in this day and age. Back in high school, well one of my high schools, a goth guy gave me a palm reading. He told me I would die in a house full of strangers, and that an axe would be involved.\n\n\"You are, as I said, nothing special.\" Esmerelda said, still running her nails over my palm lines, \"Nothing you have done in your life up until now has been important and nothing you do after this in your life will be important.\" Boston grabbed my wrist and pulled it from her grasp. \"That's enough of that, Esme, the kid is sticking around and that's final. Now stop bothering her and the poor guy back there and let's get to the scene.\" He then dropped my hand and turned to leave the Denny's without another word. I shot Esmerelda a frown and quickly went after him, shoving my hands into my jacket pockets. Anyone who knows Ohio knows how awful the cold is this time of year. Just another reason to hate this place. \"You seen your boss around lately?\" Boston asked over his shoulder. I shook my head, \"No, I was just pulling some overtime during the break that day. I haven't stepped foot in the school since.\" \"Good, good. Then we're returning to the crime scene...will you be okay with that?\" This time he actually glanced back at me.\n\nI thought back to a comment I got on here, about how I should really get my whole puking thing under control if I was going to be involved in this investigation.\n\nIt's a good thing I decided to skip lunch when Boston came calling. I'm still not sure how he got my number though.\n\n\"I'm good.\" I gave Boston a nod and he gave me a crooked half smile before pulling his hat over his eyes and turning down the next alley. Left and right, left and right. When we got closer to the crime scene Esmerelda pushed past me and followed Boston as he stepped over the yellow tape. The cops had already cleaned up everything. Now all that was left was a smell and dried blood, and a homeless woman crouched near a dumpster in the far corner. Not too strange considering the area we were in. The other two didn't acknowledge her so neither did I.\n\n\"Yes..\" Esmerelda began, lifting her arms in the air just as the wind picked up, causing the long sleeves to billow in the air dramatically. \"I can sense a presence here, yes. You said this was a scene of violence, correct?\" She turned to face Boston, arms still outstretched. \"Yeah, a girl last seen with my suspect.\" As they spoke I noted the woman near the dumpster shift in her position, head lifted to watch us now. My blood turned cold.\n\nIt was the girl.\n\n\"Boston...\" I tried, but Esmerelda spoke over me, her tone louder as if to drown me out. God, I hate her already. \"Yes, I sense the girl. She is here.\" She walked slowly towards the corner, but not the one the girl sat in. \"She is here. Yes. Here. Dear, hello? Can you hear me? I am Madame Esmerelda. What is your name?\" She looked like a nutter, talking to that empty corner. I looked back to the girl, who was now twitching her head to the side uncomfortably. Like the jerky movements from a Japanese horror movie. Something was vibrating nearby. Esmerelda carried on, \"Elizabeth Witt..that's a lovely name, dear. A very lovely name.\" And one that she could have just gotten off the news yesterday when they reported on the murder. The urge to roll my eyes was so hard it actually hurt. \"Can you tell us what you remember first, just about yourself? I know how stressful this must be for you, and in cases like this your..kind..they tend to forget things. Can you start with your parents names?\" More things she could have easily gotten from the news. \"Joshua and Clementine Witt...yes, of course I'll talk to them for you, dear.\" Again the girl twitched, this time in a more aggravated manner. \"What's your favorite color? Yellow? Yes, that's mine too, it's a good color.\"\n\nIt went on like this for five minutes. Pointless questions and that damn vibrating getting louder and louder each time, but nobody else seemed to be able to hear it. And that woman in the corner was twitching more and more, the motion becoming almost aggravated. Then finally, as Esmerelda asked one more question, the woman stood, and my breath caught in my throat.\n\nI've seen ghosts for as long as I could remember.\n\nBut I've never seen anything like...like *this*.\n\nIt was the girl, Elizabeth Witt, just as pretty as she was the last time I saw her...at first. But with each jerky step she took towards Esmerelda she changed. Her skin grew pale, grey, and no sound came from her mouth as it hung open, only this black liquid, almost like blood but just...not. I could feel my stomach lurching, trying to force me to dry heave. I forced it down, balling my fists and digging my nails into my skin. I wouldn't, no matter how badly I trembled and my stomach churned, I wouldn't...\n\nThen it happened.\n\nHave any of you guys seen that one alien movie, where those things burst out of peoples chests? I've never seen it myself, but I know the scene because who doesn't, but anyway it was like that. Her chest just...burst out, and it was like the day we found her, ripped open, laying in her own blood. That did it. I felt my legs buckle and I staggered to the dumpster, collapsing to my hands and knees as I still tried to will myself not to throw up. That vibrating was so loud and right in my ear. I tried to focus on it, keep from throwing up. With a shaking hand I groped under the dumpster until I felt something vibrating madly. Pulling it out I saw that it was a grey flip phone, adorned with some bear charms. I flipped it opened and was greeted with a background of a smiling Elizabeth Witt and some woman I didn't know, but they looked similar. A mom, maybe? It made my heart drop. This was her phone, and it was blowing up with messages from no number.\n\n**Can you see me?**\n\n**My name is Elizabeth Witt.**\n\n**Thank god someone can finally see me!!**\n\n**My parents are Joshua and Clementine!**\n\n**Green!**\n\n**No! It's not yellow!**\n\n**I didn't say any of that, why are you lying?**\n\n**Liar!**\n\n**Stop it!**\n\n**Shut up!**\n\n**s̷h̵u̴t̴ ̴u̴p̷**\n\n**s̷͕̿h̴̘̋ù̴͔t̸̬̕ ̸͕͋ǘ̵̡p̷͔̌**\n\n**ś̸̻͓͝h̴̺̖̮̉̏̍ù̷̻̜̆̈́t̵͔͑́ ̸̼̊͊͜ũ̴̩̭p̵̮̰̒͑͘**\n\n**ș̴͈̔̊͗͗̑h̶̻̉ȕ̴̲̟̰̉͝t̴̮̥̘̦́̎̓͝ ̸̮̺͙̼̜͗̃̚ư̴̭͓̿̏̏͠ṗ̸̝̫̈͂**\n\n**ș̴͈̔̊͗͗̑h̶̻̉ȕ̴̲̟̰̉͝t̴̮̥̘̦́̎̓͝ ̸̮̺͙̼̜͗̃̚ư̴̭͓̿̏̏͠ṗ̸̝̫̈͂**\n\n**s̸̲̤̼̜̻̓͊͌̿̇̾̕͜h̸̡͇̀ù̴̮̜̯̗̞̠̈́͋̄͆͜ť̶͖͔̣̳̣̜͑̔̀ ̵̧͖̥̯̥̔̾̌̎̀ũ̸̡͇͚̙̬̿̀͐͝ͅp̸͓̆͌ ̶̫̮̜͕̻͂̓̽̈́̊ͅs̸͇̜̪̾h̸̳̗͓̣̔͌̕û̶̩̝̀͑͜t̴̫̯̙͉̬̐͜ ̸̨͇͉̣̥͂̀̿͗u̴̩̣͜͜͝p̴̙͉̻̲̤̘̈́̈̓͗̈̊ ̵̧̡̮̱͈̤̉͐̇͒̏̀́s̶̗͚̀͆̆̄͐̚̚ͅh̴̺̊͐̑̅u̵͔̓͘t̸̨̼̝̬͚͙̅̐͂́ ̸̢̭͌̆̈́ư̵̯̻͉̦̰͋̚͜p̵̹̼̤̪͘͠͝s̴͚̟̹̈́̑̐͝h̷̛̝̬̲̣̩̀́ṵ̸̪̭͈͓̊̚ṱ̸̭͕͇͖̣̅̌ ̶̩̈́͊͌͝ȕ̸̗̱̝p̷̨̦̭͚͇̄̀̈́͜ ̸̨̱̼̤͔̊s̷̙̰̙̬̼̻̀̄̅̌h̵̢̲̥̼̬͙̅͒̕̕͜͝ų̵̠͍̻͎́͋̆̔̚ͅt̷͈́̒̎̿ ̵̛̹͔̒ư̵̬͖̪̦̦̠̋̐ͅp̷̰̤̗̥͉͑͋̂̊̋̇͜ ̴̣͉̅s̵̢̩͚̝̼̪̏̃̀̿h̴̭̱͈̥͌̽̔̈́̏͑̀ū̴̳̋t̴̢̢̄ ̵̢̢̱̺̘͙̈̏͑̀͂͘ư̶͔̙̍̿̓͠p̶̛͖͚̭͌̈͗́͋ ̶̡̣̘̹͕̲̔͌̿ŝ̴̭̭̗h̶̨̘͖͍̖̉̑͆̐͐u̵͖̣̣͚̮̍͒͘t̴̙͛̍̿̃̃͘͝ ̴̨̯̗͎̫͙̿̊̽̆̕ͅu̷̮̥̪͇͉̻̜͒̔͑̃̚p̵̙̬̫̈́ ̵̝̥̊̋͝s̴͖̦͇̲̹̳̠̄h̷̢̙͔̯̅̒̉́̚͝u̶̡̢̹̮͎̬͗̿͑t̵̖̺̬̎̊ ̷̱̙̩̺̲̽͗̈́͊̏̃́͜͜u̷̫͚͎̤͆̋͜p̶͇͙̽̄ ̶͉̼̹̻̘̑̃͑͠ş̵͍̭̻̬͓̍͑̌h̷̢̦̮̤̩̀̔̊u̴̧̜͔̞͕̖̇ẗ̷͎̳̦̟́͘͠ ̷̡̤̌͌ů̷̧̦̪͚̠̈p̶̩̤͇̀̀͗̾͛̂̑ ̶̯̔͗̇͒͐̉ş̸̢̲͓̪̬̲̀̏̎͝h̴͇͋̄ǘ̴̯̝̫̮̖̬͜ț̸̛̬̜̻̻͓̾̃͗̃̆͠ͅ ̶̰̪͒̋ư̸̭̲̦͙̞͗̌̽͛̚̚p̷̥̝͔͇͚̭̳̍ ̸̢̖̞̠̊̈́̒͘͜͜s̸̨̭̠̮͚͉̦̋̽͛̐̚h̵̡̺̣̰͕̮̚ù̸͙́͊ͅt̵̡̮̫͙̜̦̣̂̄͆́̒̑ ̴̳̯̼̤̟͙͛͒̍̂̽̀͘ư̴̼̂p̶̮̤͉͇̒ ̸̮̳͔̮̔̋ͅś̶̨̩͇͚̟̒͑̚h̵̰̤̦͙̐̎͌̍̚û̶̮̫̖̳̳͊̈́̋͂̏̚t̵̲̼̠̃̿̏ ̴̼̙̳̅͐̽́̄̽ű̶͈̓̅̓̕p̵̬̖̭̣̤̙̣̑̅͗͑̊̚͘ ̷̣̙̗̻̌̉̀͛̐̚̕s̵͙͌̀̕h̶̛̘́̎̎͝ư̸̺̆̓̓̍t̵̢͚̖͇̀̐͗̓̀̇͠ ̵͙̣̃̎̓̾̍u̷̻͍̖̿ͅp̶̱͍̠̘̗̤͖̄͑̿́͠ ̷̄̉͜s̴̥̹̰͇̠̫͍̾̋̇̉̒͠͠h̸͈̩͆͗̈́͋͝ų̷̗̖̫͈̤̰͐̈́̄̾̔͛t̵̯̤͚̩͈͋̾̒̀͗͜ ̸̜͎̙̲͍̿̊̍̋͆͑u̸͉̞͓͊̇͂͋͠p̸̠̫̼͆̀͆̊ ̴̝̳̟͚̳̊͂̄̓̀͜s̶̖̲͊̓́͛̏̚h̷̨̲̲͂̊̊̅͋͂̕ư̶̢̡̝̰̲̓̅̉̚͝͝t̶̹̓̈́ ̴̣͖̭̆ú̷̘̼̍͗p̶̃̍̚͘̚ͅ ̷̡̛͙̜͇̺̝̿͆͛s̷̰̞̰̼̭̈́̏̉̇͗͠h̷̖̭̤̣̄̅̍͊̿̈́u̶̝̐́ţ̷̡̘̖̝̰͉̑̉̈́͛̓ ̶̹̦͍̌͋̆͝ư̵͉̳͓̮͍̘̼̋͒͆̈́̍͝p̴̢̱͍̫͎͐̿͊̓̚ ̵̨̯̤̪̗̖̼̀̇s̸͎̻̘̲̈́́̿ȟ̷̺̳͍̠͊̽͌̈́͋͗u̴̢͇̗͉̍̒̍̍ͅͅt̴̮̥̣̦͕͇͔̍̐͐̋̕ ̶̧̣̬͕̭̬̈̇̋̄̚ự̶̹̓̃͗p̴̘͓̰͉̊̑̀͝ ̷͚͔͎͎̲́͑͜s̸͚̙͛̾̈́́̅̐̕h̸̢̰͑͠u̸̲̖̝̾̎̈́̓̾̒t̷̡̡̼̞̫̪̥͒ ̵̨̛̭̰̘̲̦͎̓͠u̷̗̲̲̬̟̿͜p̶͙̦̔͜ ̴̨̧̝̣̖̉ͅs̸̝͉̭͖̯̝̻͋̓̎h̴̙̋̔̉͐͋̍ú̵͈̫̬͝t̴̡͕̥̞͍̉͑͗ ̴͔̣̬̅͛̾̈̊̒u̵̡̬̱̠͚̕͜p̴̹̭͙̽̑́͗͑ͅ ̸̘̻̜̹̪̈̅̆̄̀́̀s̶̡̢̢͙̠͖̠̔̈́̅ẖ̷͔͙̻͍̔͜u̴̡̿̔̃̚̚t̶̡̗̼̳̾ ̸͚̹̈u̶̧̼̙̦͋͒̆͆͊͗̕p̷̞̞̗͍̖̦̊̂̆͋͜ ̸̝̹̗̥̱̫̥̈̾̋̀͆͝ ̸̗͖̲̳̅͋̋́͘͜s̸̘͇͎̻͎̼̬͘h̴̗̠͈̼͙̲̯̄͂͠ṵ̸̝̌̋͂ṯ̷̪̾̅̿ ̷̗̭̪̼̓ư̶̧̦̰̌͊ṕ̷͉͍͓͙ş̷̯̺͎̍̒̌̎h̶̓̀ͅù̷͖͇͇͖̉ͅt̶̮̙̭̒̏͋̀ ̸̪͎̬̃́ͅu̶̪͙͇̽̉͑̓p̷̱̭͈͗͊̄̅ ̵̳̞͍̼̙̬̣̐̏̈́̋̊̌͠s̷̨̖̜̼͈̉̈̆̀͝͝h̸̻̙͕̐̅͗̊u̴̡̟͍̺̾̚͝t̶̛͖ ̴̲̼̫͊̈̓̊͂́̕ů̴̧͉͉͉̣̟͈͒͘͠p̵̨͇̥̓̓̐̄̄̚͝ ̷͚͈̝̪̘̀̓͗̽͘͝ͅs̵͓̫̆̎̈́͑̅͘h̸̛͈̘́͝ự̴̧̫̳̻͍̪̃̒̔͑͂͝t̴͎̤͂̈̓͊̑̔̽ ̵̡̩̝̪͍͒̇̃͑ů̴͓̖̲̞̻̙̦́́̈́̈͠p̷̢̧̮͖̣̞̩̑̀́́s̴͕̅̂̉̎̋́̊h̵͍̗̤̠̿ù̸̢̱̤̥̘̐̍̅ͅt̷̜͉͌̏̇̕ ̴̛̞̠͒̈͌͘u̵̹̬̦̘̓̏͗̏͊͗͝p̸̦͔̬̳̪̉̂̋̿͛͆̒s̵̡̳̟̞̲̥͋̒͒̐̽h̷̙͇̬̩͒̈́͂ũ̸̘̲͈̟͇̒͑͊̏͋͜͝t̶̬̬̞̿͆͑ ̶̳̭͙̽̌̏̏͋̚̚ụ̷͇̇͐͆̊͝p̸̙̪̈́͑̒͋͛́́s̴̺̝̝͂̈̀͗͊̃͠ḩ̵̤̜̠̦͍̈́̆̊̑̃̾͝ụ̸̗̤̝̭̳̤͑̽t̷͎̟̝͖̗̘̙͋́̚͝ ̴̭̦̐̍̏͘͜u̵̺͕͛̒̍p̵̧̗̱̲̠̖͇̐̔̕s̸̤̝̤̉̀͑̏́̃́h̸̛͕̥̬̥͒̌͒́ű̶̧͇͈̌̚̚͜t̵̢͚͉̉̋͒́́͑̓ ̸͎͕͑́̑͑̈́̎u̸̹̤͈̙̤̍̏p̴̛̮͈̪̺͆̇̇́͝s̷̨͚͖͚̫̟̠̀h̸̲̻̜͍͔͇̉̏̓ͅủ̵̧̪̲͓̦͖̲̍̚ṯ̷̓͑̓̑̾ ̸̟̰̗̣̫̞͋̂̎̀ụ̴̘̬̻̜́̀͆̑p̶̟̯̰̝̰̌̿̚s̷̞̙̦̥̤͂̓͠ͅh̵̫͙̟̲̹̤̟̐̈ų̴͓͇̞͕͗̀ţ̴̤͚̲̳̘̤͂̇͘ ̵̝̌̆̀̅̋͝ü̸̡̜̥͙̬̲̃̕p̵̨͎̞̥̹̯̮̒̎́̀͐̓̚s̶̨̙̼͚̮̖̄̓̓h̸̻̱̱̳̅͐̋͗̐͝ű̸̟̗̫̜̫̲͑̅͗͐t̸̢̋̎̍̕̚ ̵̙͇̍͑̓̓ú̶̢͗̐p̴̯͙̭͉͈̳̄͂̌́ ̸̠̰̀̈́̅s̸̤͎̙̯̣̩̗͠h̴̨͎̰̖͙̎̔͌̓͠ȗ̵̢̥̹t̵͓̼͠ ̸̨̤̱̕ȗ̸͙͔͔͚̣͙͊p̶̺̻̥̩͍̎̔̄͒͋ͅ ̶̥̼͈̟͈͓̀̾̀̿̄̄s̵̪͈̅͌̈́͝h̷̫̩̰̐͠u̸̺͕̐̊̏̆̚ṱ̵̱̫̬̻͊̄̄̑ ̸͖̮̼͉̪͉͉̀̾̒̀ṳ̴̯͙̈́̆̈́̈́p̴̖͎͈̟̓͑̓̄̃͊̅ ̶͉̹̲̺͊̉͋͝ṡ̶̩̗̙̰͕̳h̶̼͗́̐̏̆ū̵̢͍͖͉̯̮͍͑́t̷͎̒͗̒͗̍͑ͅ ̵̫̩̰̹̦̬̌͛û̵͚͔̗͖̚͝p̴͍̱̺͎̀̇̓̚ ̶̨̛͓̺͊̈́̀̈̔ș̸̠̯̝̜̽h̶̝̞̋̚͠u̴̝̜̱̗̮̟̲͋̅͗͑̉̒͝ṭ̸̰̈̃͜ ̴̟̜̄̀͛̋u̶̞͍̝͛͊p̵̨̛͇̌̇̐́ͅ ̴͉͖̞̰͓̏͐͛ͅs̸̨͔̄h̶̯͕̯̭̍̃u̵̝͔͙̥͎̇̀̒̇̕͠͝t̶̢̮̤̣͕͊͋ ̵͈̃͆̑u̴̢̎͆̾̚͝ṗ̶̨̩̲̦̝̗̒̿̉͘ ̴̩͇̗͉̥́ş̷̨͙͚͔͉̟͋͛͆̃͝ḥ̴̰̩̳̟̟̄͋͌̾̓u̶̱͓̖̞̇̏͐͛̕ͅt̷̩̦̃̎̀ ̷͉̳͙͚̙͓̿͒̽͘ǔ̴̫͇͙̠̗̑̿͗̒͝ͅp̶̦͚͉̠͍͙̎́́̈́̚ ̶̼̟͇̽͑͒̐̒̊̎s̸̮̯͎̫͑̅h̷̨͙̜͗́̐̒̾̎û̶̳t̵̢̧̗͔͛̏͛͛̈͌̾ ̴͉̫̱̥́͛̚u̸̹̼̬̹͒p̵̥̃̔̊ ̵̧̥̲̯̼͓̅̏̾͘s̵̻̬̀̆͑̓̀̂h̷̫̣͓̫̭͎͂̅̈́͝ͅů̴̱͍̅̽̀̀̂t̸̤̥͔̫͔͚̕͘ͅ ̸̛̳̰̱͎̟͉͛u̴͔͂͜p̷̺̱̦̙̊͋͋̔̐͘̕ ̶̫̣̲̖̩̜͔̃̾̀̀͆̑͛s̴̨̲̲̙̪̤̲͌ḧ̴̙͈́͘͜ủ̷̜͉̙͈̤̝̲͗̌t̴̯̞̪̣̯̜̕̕͜ ̴̱̎͋͗͆ụ̶̟͕̫͈̍̑͗̕̚p̸̡̖̥̳̞͆͜**\n\nDon't throw up, don't throw up, do not throw up.\n\nI clutched the phone to my chest, my hands shaking as I turned to see Elizabeth screaming in Esmerelda's face, while that hack was completely unaware of it. As she screamed, the phone gave a long, seemingly never ending vibration. I nearly dropped the phone, fumbling with it in my hands as I forced myself towards them. My legs felt like lead and my head felt hot. I may not have thrown up yet but I might pass out, I figured. It felt a lot like when I found Heather's body. \"Esmerelda.\" I tried, but if she heard me she pretended not to, asking more questions and making the ghost of Elizabeth Witt angrier and angrier. Now I was less worried about throwing up and more worried about pissing myself. And then I saw the tears streaming down Elizabeth's face and my fear became something else.\n\nAnger.\n\n\"Esmerelda!\" I yelled this time and she whipped around, one of her stupid long sleeves nearly whapping me in the face. \"I am *working*, child!\" She snapped back, \"Very *important* work, work you couldn't possibly understand, so unless it's something that cannot wait-\" You aren't speaking to Elizabeth Witt.\" I snarled, shoving the phone in her face, \"You aren't speaking to her and she *knows*.\" The color drained from Esmerelda's face and she started to open and close her mouth like a fish. The phone stopped vibrating for a moment, then started once more. I looked at it.\n\n**Can you see me?**\n\nTaking a deep breath I turned around and nearly jumped when I found the ghost mere inches from my face. I swallowed, nodding, \"Yeah. Yeah, I can see you. Can you tell me..who killed you?\" She stared at me blankly for what felt like the longest time before one last message was sent to the phone.\n\n**Pete Ness.**\n\n\"...Thank you.\" I told her, \"I promise...he isn't going to get away with this. Boston?\" I turned to the large man, who was staring holes into me with a look of mild interest. \"What next?\" \"...Next, you go home and get some rest, then tomorrow we do a stake out at the bookstore. I doubt Ness can wait much longer to target another girl.\" He didn't even bother speaking to the still babbling Esmerelda as he strolled out of the alleyway. I gave one last look to Elizabeth and silently promised to come back to her one day before jogging after him. Boston went the opposite way from my apartment, but he left me with one last word. \"You did good today, kid.\"\n\nI'm so, so god dam tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ztysnt/my_boss_has_been_taking_women_into_his_office_and/)",

All of them were limited to a specific collection. A way to mimic what was on the outside to give us a sense of having entertainment and choices when in reality we only learned and saw what we were supposed to.\n\nOf course, I didn't know it then.\n\nAnd I never should have known. I never would have figured it out if it weren't for that slight coincidence that got the suspicion rolling.\n\nAlex says it might have been fate.\n\nI believe it was my dad. \n\n\\--\n\nMy name written on the stomach of a boy I'd never seen before had to mean something. Of course, after what I'd seen in the night, I wasn't yet sure whether I could trust this Alex. \n\nI had been living a happy and fulfilled life in Agsbury. There was never anything that I missed, nothing I desperately longed for. \n\nHe was the only factor that led to the disruption of my belief system and what kind of person would I be if I let some random guy do that? I had a mind of my own after all. \n\nSo I tried to ignore the issue. I told myself that I'd ask Alex to leave me alone if he tried to bother me again. He should play his weird games on his own.\n\nI was set on that but then Alex surprised me.\n\nFor the next few days, we saw each other occasionally. We'd get the mail from outside at the same moment, we'd be at the grocery store picking something up for our parents or we'd be at the sports center at the same time.\n\nAnd every time he e was being awfully normal.\n\nDuring each of those occasions, Alex acted just like everyone else. He waved, said hello, or he'd ask me something simple like \"do you know where the green beans are?\" but it never went further than that. \n\nHe treated me just like a regular neighbor, he had entirely adapted to our way of living.\n\nAnd that's what got my blood boiling. He ignored the issue which resulted in me not being able to ignore it any longer. \n\nThis boy had brought some kind of change to town, I just didn't know what exactly was going on.\n\nOf course, I couldn't talk to my parents about any of this. Not after the way they reacted on the night, I saw the strange act of Alex through his window. \n\nI didn't even tell Jules, my closest and longest friend. For reasons I couldn't explain I felt I had to keep it all to myself. In Agsbury we don't voice criticism or speak of bad emotions. Most of the time we don't need to and when you do feel negative, it feels silly to bother others with it. \n\nYou don't want to be the odd one out.\n\nSo I thought the best thing I could do would be to befriend Alex to try and figure out more about him. \n\n\\--\n\n\"So this is where you usually hang out?\" \n\nAlex's gaze switched between Jules and me. \n\nWe were sitting at the coffee house overlooking the marketplace. Getting him to join us for coffee was easy, I just acted like it was a spontaneous idea when I saw him helping his mum out in their yard. She was thrilled by the idea of him socializing as well.  \n\n\"Not exclusively but often. We usually come after school but it's the holidays now,\" Jules said. \n\nAlex nodded.\n\n\"It's nice. Good coffee,\" he said and added three cubes of sugar to his cup.\n\n\"Yes, it's the absolute best. Well, to be honest, it is the same roast you can get at the market as well but it does taste nicer when someone else brews it I think.\" Jules kept talking. \n\nAlex nodded and kept adding sugar cubes to his coffee.\n\n\"That's a lot of sugar,\" I said when his cup was starting to overflow. Jules hadn't even noticed.\n\n\"Oh,\" Alex looked down. \"Sorry, I think I zoned out for a moment. Last night I-\"\n\nHe was interrupted by the waitress who came over with a pot full of fresh coffee. Without even asking, she started pouring coffee into Alex's cup which was already filled to the brim. \n\n\"Oh look at you, your drink is all sugared up! We should add a bit more caffeine or the sweetness will go to your head!\" She cheerfully said as she removed his cup and filled a new one with coffee so hot that it looked like it was boiling inside of the cup. \n\n\\--\n\nAlex was really fun once he warmed up. He seemed witty and fit well into our little group. I was starting to think that he could hang out with me and Jules more often. \n\nWe sat in the coffeehouse for another hour that practically flew by, talking about all sorts of things. As it turned out we had a lot of the same favorite movies, books, and artists which made me wonder how he'd grown up.\n\n\"What was the place like where you lived before?\" I asked. \n\nAlex didn't even think before answering. \n\n\"Typical, not spectacular. A place to live, not to love. We had neighbors but no real community. And our house wasn't as nice as the one we live in now.\"\n\nI thought his reply sounded a bit strange but Jules nodded in agreement. \n\n\"Makes sense, your old one wasn't built by Charlie after all\" \n\n\"I didn't build anything,\" I rolled my eyes.\n\n\"What about you guys? Did you always live in Agsbury?\" \n\nI thought about it for a second. \n\n\"Well ever since I can remember, so I suppose always.\"\n\nJules nodded in agreement. \n\n\"So you were born here?\" \n\nJules answered before I could. \n\n\"No, nobody is born here. You come to Agsbury when you become a family, my mum said you have to apply and they mostly consider people who already have children. It does make sense because the houses are all too big for just a couple or a single person.\"\n\n\"Sounds logical, so you were probably just too young to remember moving here.\"\n\nJules nodded.\n\n\"All I know is that our families must have come here only a year apart from each other because Charlie and I've known each other since kindergarten.\"\n\nFor some peculiar reason, she said that in a threatening tone. Was Jules afraid that Alex, as my new neighbor, would replace her as a friend? It felt flattering though unnecessary.\n\nAlex ignored her and looked at me.\n\n\"What about your brother? How old is he, like ten? Do you remember him being born?\" \n\nI opened my mouth to answer but couldn't when I felt a pulsating pain going through my left hand that was holding my coffee cup. I immediately dropped the cup which started spilling all over the table.\n\n\"What the-?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, I am sorry, I must be losing my mind missing your cup like that. Let me make that up to you with a free piece of pie?\" \n\nIt was the waitress who, without me noticing, was back at the table. \n\nI hadn't even asked for a refill. \n\n\\--\n\nOn our cycle back home all I could think about was Benny. He'd always been my brother but I had never thought about his birth until Alex asked about it. It must have been here in Agsbury but why couldn't I remember anything about it?\n\nJules and Alex were talking about all kinds of things on our way home but I stayed silent, I was too occupied with my own thoughts. \n\nI hadn't even realized that we were already back on our street. \n\n\"Do you guys wanna go to the cinema or something tomorrow?\" She said once we were in front of my house. \n\n\"Yeah, that sounds good!\" Alex said and I nodded. \n\nWe said our goodbyes and Jules cycled on. \n\nAlex was just about to head home as well but I grabbed his arm before he could.\n\n\"Why are you acting like nothing happened?\"\n\nI surprised myself with my sudden courage.\n\nAlex's face shifted for a second. His brows frowned but then he forced it back to a smile. \n\n\"I'm trying to be normal. Well, for my parents,\" he looked around the street. \"They like it here, it makes them happy. I want to be happy too. I shouldn't have jumped on you like that. I just found it so weird that your name was on my skin when I'd never even met you before. And I'm pretty sure that it has been on my stomach before we even moved here. Like someone tried to make sure I wouldn't forget, you know?\"\n\nHe shook his head before I could answer. \n\n\"Sorry, I think it's best if we just don't think about it any longer. I actually get an awful migraine when I try to. I'll see you tomorrow?\"\n\n\\--\n\nMaybe Alex was able to shove his suspicions down but I couldn't any longer. I contemplated talking to my parents about Benny's birth during dinner but for some reason, I couldn't. It seemed like a bad idea, though I couldn't explain why. \n\nI acted normal, just like Alex but that night I couldn't sleep again.\n\nI'd never had trouble with sleep before, something about me had changed ever since the Lesters moved in next door. And it wasn't just me who acted differently. \n\nThat night I realized that there was something wrong with my family as well.\n\nI was lying in bed, my eyes open and focused on the ceiling, my thoughts flowing in all sorts of directions.\n\nAnd then I heard it. \n\nA sound through the usually so suffocating silence. I got up to look at Alex's window but this time it wasn't coming from him.\n\nIt was coming from downstairs. That was strange.\n\nMy parents were *never* up at night. \n\nMy heart was racing inside my chest as I slowly made my way down the stairs, following the voice of someone to the kitchen.\n\nIt's hard to say where my nervousness was coming from. That was my home, after all, the place that should make me feel safe. And the thing is, I wasn't scared of an intruder. We didn't have any crime in Agsbury, it was the safest place you could imagine.\n\nI was so scared because the person whose voice I was hearing was my father. \n\nHe was speaking so quietly that I wasn't sure what he was muttering at first. But then I realized it was a name.\n\n\"Lucia.\"\n\nHis whisper slowly became louder.\n\n\"Lucia.\"\n\n\"Lucia. You are dead.\"\n\n\"We are all dead.\"\n\nThe unusual sight of my father at night like this, talking that way, sent a shiver down my spine. For a moment I just stood in the doorway, not sure what to do. \n\nFinally, I whispered.\n\n\"Dad?\" \n\nWith a sudden move, he turned around and our eyes met. I can't say which of us looked more distressed. \n\n\"They are growing corpses, you die the second you step foot here,\" he said. \n\n\"Wha-?\" \n\nMy breathing stopped when I suddenly felt a touch on my shoulder. \n\n\"What is going on here?\"\n\nIt was my mum. And I'd never been happier to see her. \n\n\\--\n\nMum walked dad back upstairs to their room. Then she came back and heated up a cup of milk for me. \n\n\"Your father did something horrible,\" she said after a long silence. \"But he never meant to. He is a good man, a truly good man. Sometimes his head becomes a bit broken,\" she looked at me, wiping away a single tear from her cheek. \n\n\"But please don't worry, my child. I will call the doctor tomorrow and he will be fine. Go back to bed now, I will bring you the milk, okay?\" \n\nShe smiled at me and we hugged. For a moment I really felt better and safe again. I walked towards the stairs but turned around one more time to ask my mother something that had been bugging me since the afternoon.\n\n\"Mum, what was the place like where we lived before here?\"\n\nMy mother smiled and answered without thinking about it for even a second.\n\n\"Typical, not spectacular. A place to live, not to love. We had neighbors but no real community. And our house wasn't as nice as the one we live in [now.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)",

        "text": "To start this off, I've never done this before. However there isn't much to lose, so here's my story. Ever since I was young, I've been more attuned to the supernatural. Starting when I was 11, I had an outer body experience where this snake figure with white slitted eyes visited me. It said one day, it would come for me and that I shouldn't resist. It threatened to torture my family whilst I watched, that I'd have to do as they say. I got woken up by my mum, asking why I was screaming help me over and over...I didn't even hear the screams. \n\n\nYears pass, occasionally I'd see those same slitted eyes in the dark. Weird, very vivid dreams keep plaguing me, that something is always chasing me, I feel the darkness and it always says it's going to get me. Things get worse, I start drawing Norse runes (I know, totally weird but I went into a trance when it happened.) Drew them on a mirror, I have pictures of said runes. Also, I'm not prone to hallucinations before anyone asks. \n\nIn my sleep I'll visit these places I've never been to, one was a place with an endless green field and a sun that was almost too bright. A guy in red and gold armour, told me to be careful. One was a bar with no outside details, a bar with booths yet all the windows showed was white bright light. People I didn't recognise were there, old and young. The most recent was this very Roman kind of place, pillars with eagles on the tops, the baths and people dressed very similar for that era of time. It was an island, it was peaceful though. Then evil wise, we are talking foggy, dark forests or trapped in some very old fashioned house. \n\nI sometimes speak in a dilect that is not known to me, and I feel just like I want answers. It's so frustrating, to go through all of this without really knowing why. Perhaps it's some kind of curse, but maybe not. \n\nThese things keep happening to me, and I thought writing this might get me some answers that I'm looking for. I've always been drawn to the supernatural, it's always just been there. It seems like it'll keep happening, but I don't want to stumble in the dark anymore.\n\nMore recently, the vivid dreams keep happening like something is trying to tell me what I need to know. By the time I wake up, it completely disappears. it feels on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't remember. it's very annoying.\n\n\nSometimes when I close my eyes, I see faces I haven't seen before. Or eyes looking back at me. I honestly don't know why I've been going through this, and I'm hoping maybe some of you have been through similar things? I'm not mentally ill or anything and I don't take drugs, I'm just looking for help or advice.",

        "text": "I work with a package delivery service to make an extra buck or two since I’m a college student in some need for cash. I work minimum wage at around $15 an hour in New York, but I was looking for way to earn some more cash to buy some fun things like new video games that are coming out soon, as well as treating myself to a nice dinner every once in a while instead of having the bland mush I get from my meal plan.\n\nI spoke to my supervisor about it and he asked me if I was willing to do anything to get some extra cash, in a very weird tone.\n\nI said yes, albeit nervously, and was told to stay after hours to talk about a potential opening that is very lucrative for someone of any age.\n\nFast forward to later that night, I’m sitting outside on the curb of the store, smoking a cigarette, when my boss pokes his head out and tells me to come inside and to go to the back of the store.\n\nI did as I was told and met him, we went outside the back of the store, where I saw a dirt trail I don’t think I ever saw before.\n\nHe’s cut right to the chase and told me that this position pays $1,000 per delivery, and all I had to do was take this package (which he had tucked under his arm), and walk it to the very end of that trail.\n\nI thought this was awesome, super fast money by delivering one box? I told him to sign me up.\n\nHe handed me the package as well as a long note attached to the box itself.\n\nHe explained that there are a few rules that I needed to follow in order to do the job right, and… safely.\n\nI, now back to being concerned said ok, as he walked back into the store and locked the door behind him.\n\nI looked down back at the box. It was relatively small, and light, as if there was nothing inside it…\n\nThe note read as followed:\n\n\nValued Employee,\n\nAs you are about to see, this path is not normal. During the day it may seem as such, but nightfall reveals otherwise. A gate that sits between our dimension and another will open, and a very specific set of rules MUST be followed in order for you to complete your delivery.\n\nI thought to myself “What the hell is this cryptic shit?” I kept reading:\n\nPlease Read and Memorize:\n\n1. Always walk at a steady pace, do not speed up or slow down at an abnormal rate.\n\n2. Be sure to ALWAYS bring a flashlight.\n    •If it starts to flicker, REPLACE THE BATTERIES IMMEDIATELY.\n\n3. By no means should you speak throughout the journey unless directly prompted by Rule 6.\n\n4. If you hear unintelligible whispers behind you, DO NOT LOOK. (They will disappear eventually)\n\n5. If you hear a friend or family member call for you in the distance:\n    •DO NOT LOOK IN THE DIRECTION OF ORIGIN\n    •DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THE VOICE IN ANY WAY\n    •If you feel you must look, COVER YOUR EYES WHILE DOING SO.\n\n6. If an ordinary looking person emerges out from the woods and asks where the nearest town is, DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT, state this exact phrase: “It’s back the way you came” in a monotone voice, while looking straight ahead.\n    •On rare occasions when they ask you to guide them, KEEP WALKING, DO NOT FOLLOW THEM, NOR SPEAK TO THEM ANY LONGER.\n\n7. You will have something follow you constantly through out your journey, however, if the being in question attempts to gain your attention by stepping on a twig or leaf of some kind, LOOK OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER, NEVER YOUR RIGHT.\n    •If you accidentally look over your right, no matter what you see, how big or small, or how close or far, try not to make any sudden facial expressions. DO NOT SCREAM BY ANY MEANS. Calmly face back forward and continue walking normally.\n\n8. If you see a sign indicating a Dead End or to Turn Back, promptly ignore them.\n\n9. If you see a wall or barrier of any kind, it is not real. Walk through it at the same pace you were walking prior to discovery.\n\n10. You will rarely see Unknown, (otherwise known as “Shadowy”) figures walking towards you, as long as you do not become panicked by them, you will be fine.\n\n11. If you hear:\n    1. Bloodcurdling Screaming\n    2. Demonic Gibberish\n    3. Sinister Laughter\n    4. Heavy footsteps quickly approaching\n\nDO NOT LOOK BEHIND YOU AND RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.\n\nIF YOU TRIP, STOP FOR ANY REASON, OR LOOK BEHIND YOU, YOUR BRAIN WILL BE UNABLE TO PROCESS THE HORRORS AND YOU WILL “CEASE TO BE” OUT OF PURE SHOCK. \n\nIf you by some chance survive, get ready! You must prepare yourself to endure a horrific mind warping experience of [ R E D A C T E D ].\n\n12. Once you reach the end of the path, you will hear a child crying behind you, turn around slowly ONLY WHEN YOU PASS THE STONE TOTEM; this indicates that you have vacated the affected area of the gate and you are now back in your designated dimension, and one of the three following scenarios will occur:\n    \n1. If you see a normal looking child crying, DO NOT HELP THEM, this means that you may take the path once more tomorrow night.\n    \n2. If you see a normal looking crying child approaching you, blink three times to make them disappear, the child will be replaced with a rotary phone that will almost immediately ring after the child’s disappearance, DO NOT ANSWER IT and carry on with your evening activities.\n    \n3. If the air falls silent and the child stares at you with dark eyes, blood replacing their tears and an impossibly wide smile, DO NOT TAKE THE PATH EVER AGAIN.\n(Note: Notify your supervisor with photographic evidence to be placed into a different department).\n\nWe thank you for your sacrifice in aiding your fellow peers of the Pozal-Go family in this top secret delivery assignment, and wish you the best of luck on your journey!\n\nSincerely,\nPozal-Go Corporate\n\nI thought that this was some sort of sick joke that was being played on me, but just as I was about to turn around, I stopped dead in my tracks, since I thought I heard the sound of whispering coming behind me.",

        "text": "I was walking through the park with my parents, enjoying the warm sunshine and the sights and sounds of the city. We stopped at a hot dog stand to grab a snack, and as we sat down at a nearby bench to eat, I announced that I was going to explore a bit on my own.\n\nMy parents hesitated at first, but eventually they agreed, telling me to be back within an hour. I set off with a spring in my step, eager to see what the city had to offer.\n\nAs I walked down the street, I came across a cute little boba tea shop called \"Boba Tea Delight.\" The colorful sign and the smell of sweet, creamy tea wafting through the open door beckoned me inside.\n\nI stepped into the shop and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff and the cozy atmosphere. I ordered a refreshing iced tea and found a seat at the bar. As I sipped my drink, I struck up a conversation with a cute boy named Tom who was sitting next to me.\n\nWe talked for hours, lost in our own little world, and before I knew it, the sun had set and it was getting late. I called my parents to tell them I was staying at a friend's house for the night, not wanting to cut my time with Tom short.\n\nWe made our way back to his house, where we cooked dinner together and spent the night together, cuddled up in his cozy bed.\n\nBut as the night wore on, I began to notice something strange about Tom. There was something off about the way he moved and the way he looked at me. And when I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, I found that Tom was nowhere to be found.\n\nI searched the house, calling out his name, but there was no answer. And then, as I turned a corner, I saw him standing in the hallway, a glass shard in his hand and a wild look in his eyes.\n\nI froze, not sure what to do, as Tom advanced on me, his eyes fixed on mine. I knew I had to get out of there, but I was too terrified to move. And as I stood there, trembling and alone, I saw the glass shard in Tom's hand and the blood dripping from his mouth, I knew I had to get out of there. I turned and ran, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nI stumbled down the hallway and out the front door, gasping for breath as I tried to put as much distance between myself and Tom as possible. I had no idea where I was going, but I knew I had to keep moving.\n\nAs I ran, I spotted a car parked at the curb with the keys still inside. Without hesitation, I yanked open the door and climbed behind the wheel, my hands shaking as I fumbled to start the engine.\n\nFinally, the car roared to life and I floored it, tearing down the street as fast as I could go. I had no idea where I was going, but I knew I had to get as far away from Tom as possible.\n\nI drove through the dark streets of Atlanta, my heart racing as I tried to figure out what to do. I had no idea who to trust or where to turn, but I knew I couldn't go back to Tom's house.\n\nAs the miles ticked by, I began to feel a sense of dread wash over me. I knew that Tom was out there somewhere, and that he would stop at nothing to find me. And as I drove through the night, my heart racing as I tried to outrun the fear that was chasing me. But no matter how fast I drove, I couldn't shake the feeling that Tom was right behind me, ready to pounce at any moment.\n\nAs the hours ticked by, I began to feel the weight of exhaustion settling over me. I knew I couldn't keep driving forever, but I had nowhere to go and no one to turn to.\n\nJust as I was starting to lose hope, I heard the engine of the car sputter and die. I looked down at the fuel gauge and saw that it was empty. I had run out of gas.\n\nPanic set in as I pulled off to the side of the road and tried to think of what to do next. I couldn't stay in the car, but I had no idea where to go.\n\nFinally, I made a decision. I gathered up my things and fled into the darkness of the woods, hoping to find some kind of shelter or help.\n\nAs I stumbled through the underbrush, I prayed that I would find someone who could help me. And just as I was starting to lose hope, I saw the flashing lights of a police car in the distance.\n\nI ran towards the car, relief flooding through me as I saw the uniformed officer inside. But as I approached, I saw the look of disbelief and anger on his face. He didn't believe my story about Tom and accused me of lying to the police.\n\nDespite my pleas for help, the officer drove me back to my house, where I was horrified to find it engulfed in flames. As I stood there, watching my home burn to the ground I wondered “what the hell is this?” What kind of guy is this? As I type this into my computer I am in police custody and it turns out… my parents are dead. Every sound I hear scares me. I think I have trauma. I think this boy Tom is in a cult.",

        "text": " \n\nTwo Months ago, I went to one of those off-leash dog parks that have forested areas, as well as open fields with tall grass. It was later in the day, and my dog and I were playing fetch as we walked down the dirt path back to the car. We were about one hundred feet from it, so I threw the ball one last time into the open plain to our left. I watched as the blur of brown fur darted towards the tall grass. I peered over my shoulder at the field noticing my dog hadn't shown up anywhere near the parking lot. Now I'm not muscular in any way, shape, or form, so I can't throw very far. I called out towards where I threw the ball. I heard what sounded like barking from behind me (maybe 50 yards or so), but where I was looking was just more parking lot. No dogs were in sight, so I decided to go through the grass and find my dog. As I turned around there my dog was, sitting right in front of me. He didn't have his ball, but we had been there for four hours, and I just wanted to go home.\n\nThe next few weeks went by as usual with the exception of how much my dog was eating. Normally my dog would be fine with 4 cups of dog food a day (he's a large German Shepard), but instead he would act extremely aggressive when he didn't receive at least a third of the kibble a day. I'm just a twenty-something year old woman in college working at a nearby Starbucks, I don't make enough money to need more than two bags of dog food a week. I also had to buy a brand-new collar for my dog since in somehow got lost during the day at the park. I had to work overtime and move apartments. I would have gone to the vet for my dog, but I can't risk any high expenses.\n\nSince last week, my dog has been looking at me weird. He looks hungry. Malnourished even, but not in his body shape, his eyes. He looks at me with a stare I didn't think dogs could give, especially my dog. Sure, my dog is a 200 German Shepard, but he couldn't hurt a fly if he wanted to. To truly decide if he should be taken to the vet, I researched diseases for dogs that cause abnormal appetite, and sudden aggressiveness, when I heard this whimpering from my glass sliding door. It looked like my dog, but incredibly thin with his ribcage showing. He had a large gash in the side of his neck. It looked like his vocal cords were mangled. I looked at the dog who was laying down by my feet, and then back at the dog by the door. That dog tried to bark but just managed an airy, muffled, whining sound. I noticed that dog had the collar I'd bought year ago, as well as the pink scar on its nose where my dog had been cut by his previous abusive owner. The dog at my feet had a scar on its nose, but it the wrong area. It was on the snout and not the nose. That is not my dog. That is not my dog. That is not my dog.",

        "text": "We thought we were lucky to see Dad lying in that hospital bed.\n\nThere was a ventilator on his face, and a few cords attached to his chest that led to a heart monitor beside his bed.\n\nA police officer stood on the other side of the bed, chatting with someone on the other end. He glanced up and saw us walk in.\n\n“I’ll talk to you later,” he said into the phone.\n\nThe officer was about to approach us but our attention was so fixed on Dad that we barely noticed the officer at all. We simply ran past him and stood at the edge of Dad’s bed before the officer could get a single word out.\n\n“Sam?” Mom said.\n\nDad cleared his throat and came close to shutting his eyes again, but  opened them wider.\n\n“A-am I alright?” Dad asked.\n\n“It looks like it,” I said, giving him a slight smirk.\n\n“Why am I in a hospital?” Dad said.\n\nHe glanced around the room.\n\n“You were in an accident,” Mom said, “they found you in your car.”\n\n“Accident you say….well, what about my car. Is my car alright?” Dad asked.\n\nMom and I laughed.\n\n“That car is a goner,” the officer chimed in, a slight smirk stretching across his face.\n\n“No…I…I…want to get it fixed,” Dad murmured.\n\nHis speech was a bit slurred.\n\n“I’m afraid you’ll be much better off finding a new car rather than trying to repair it,” the officer said, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n“W-well shit!” Dad hissed.\n\nAll three of us burst out laughing.\n\nEventually the officer finally got a chance to introduce himself.\n\n“I’m Allen Daniels. Or you can just call me officer Daniels if you wish,” he told my mom.\n\nOfficer Daniels started to ask Mom a few questions as Dad sat up in bed listening to them both.\n\nThat’s when I walked away and dialed my best friend Kylie’s number as I stepped out of the room. It was almost four in the morning, but me and her often stayed up late on the phone anyways.\n\nWhen I got off the phone I went back into the room and found that Dad was asleep again. Mom was at the side of the bed, brushing her hand through his hair as Officer Daniels watched.\n\n“Well Mrs. Blake, I'm gonna head out now, but I will be giving you guys a visit again. Whenever Sam recovers, there are some questions I have to ask him about the accident. Maybe within another three or four weeks?” Officer Daniels said.\n\nMom looked up at him and nodded her head.\n\nDad remained stuck in the hospital for the following few weeks. When the doctor came in, he said that it was nothing short of a miracle that Dad came out of the crash with the small amount of bodily injuries he had. All there were was a few small cracks in his bones here and there, along with some slight damage to his head. But some head trauma may have had some effect on him because of how loopy and confused Dad seemed to be when first waking up.\n\nUpon visiting Dad just a day later, it was confirmed that it was indeed the accident that had altered his cognitive functioning. When Mom and I entered the room he couldn’t even remember who we were, despite the fact that we were just there the previous night. It took a few minutes for us to convince him that we were his family. After showing him several pictures on my phone of all of us together, along with verbally recalling several memorable moments in our lives, it finally clicked in.\n\nWithin the next two weeks Dad was somewhat normal again, but there were still some things his brain had trouble recalling. He no longer had an issue remembering  that I was his daughter and Mom was his wife, but he still often forgot our names. Even if we were in the middle of a conversation, or if he repeatedly said our names minutes prior, it would leave his mind within seconds as if it were never there. No matter how many times we’d remind him, he still couldn’t seem to keep up.\n\nSoon it was finally time for Dad to come home. On the day Dad was scheduled for release, my friend Kylie decided she’d go to the hospital with us.\n\nDad was seated on the edge of his bed when we all walked in his room. When he saw Kylie he seemed confused.\n\nAs we came closer a wide grin spread across Dad’s face as he looked Kylie up and down.\n\n“Who is this young gal?” he said.\n\nGal? Since when did he start talking like that?\n\n“Wow, you guys dun’ gained a bad habit of dragging some random folk’ in here ain’t ya’” Dad muttered.\n\nAll three of us glanced at each other. It looked like Mom and Kylie also noticed that something was really off about the way he was speaking.\n\nI was really puzzled at this, as Dad had just been speaking normally when we gave him a visit a few days ago. Also, what the hell was he talking about? What random people?\n\nAs I expected, he couldn’t consistently retain memories of Kylie either. But on the bright side, he was still a jokester, and he still seemed to enjoy the company of Kylie. He laughed and joked with Kylie and I all the way up until we got ready to leave.\n\nIn the midst of hysterical laughter Dad asks me, “Hey Kate, why ya’ ain’t ever tell me you had a friend that was so funny?”\n\nWhile Mom wheeled Dad out of the room, Kylie leaned forward and whispered in my ear, \n\n“What’s up with the accent?”\n\nI simply just shrugged my shoulders.\n\nDad seemed happy to be home again, although for the first few days I couldn’t tell if he actually remembered the fact that he lived here. Over time it became apparent that Dad in fact did recognize his own house and the street he lived on. He was also finally starting to resemble the Dad I’ve known all my life.\n\nThe strange southern accent that he just picked up out of nowhere eventually faded, and he remembered who Kylie was again. She was no longer referred to as “that funny girl” as I just happened to have as a friend.\n\nWhen he remembered that his car was totaled he was quite disappointed. But he had insurance, and he wouldn’t have much trouble getting another car soon.\n\nThere were still certain things Dad had to pick up on. Personal hygiene was a big one. When he first got back he hadn’t brushed his teeth or showered in three days. Mom and I noticed the musty odor radiating from him when  he walked past us, along with the foul smell coming from his mouth every time he spoke. Mom and I tried to ignore it at first. The smell was getting so bad that she just had to speak up. She urged him to head into the bathroom and take care of himself right away.\n\nShe soon discovered that Dad had also forgotten how to use a toothbrush. He had no idea how to turn on the faucet on the sink or bathtub either. Mom had to actually re-teach him these things.\n\nThe biggest glimpse of some of the few flaws still left in his brain was one morning while we were having breakfast. My parents’ anniversary was just three days away.\n\n“So Walter, what are you thinking about doing?” Mom asked, taking a sip of coffee from her mug.\n\nDad was munching away at the eggs and sausage on his plate. Then he finally glanced up at her.\n\n“Doing what?” He asked.\n\nMom stared at him with a blank face.\n\n“Well Samuel, our anniversary is on Friday and I just thought maybe you were making some plans,” Mom said.\n\n“Anniverzzery?” Dad mumbled in a very weird tone.\n\nHe could barely pronounce the word correctly.\n\n“Yes, our 25th anniversary. It is in the next few days,” Mom explained.\n\nDad could only reply with a face full of confusion.\n\nThen there was the sound of the mail truck pulling up outside. Dad caught this right away.\n\n“I have to go get the mail,” Dad said, standing up.\n\nNow, before the accident he would always procrastinate going to the mailbox, if he went at all without being reminded. It was strange that he decided to hop up the second he heard it.\n\nWhile sitting in the kitchen we hear Dad shouting outside. Mom and I went out to see what was going on.\n\nHe was having an argument with our neighbor across the street, waving his arms around in the air, shouting maniacally as our neighbor shouted back. Mom jogged her way over to Dad and tried to sway him back into the house with gentle whispers.\n\nDad and our neighbor across the street had actually been going at each other’s throats for some time. It was a few years back when the neighbor moved into our area. Most of the homeowners in our area were middle aged, and he was no different. He didn’t appear to have a wife or any children. Since he’s been around I don’t recall ever seeing anyone else at his house but him.\n\nWithin weeks we were starting to see the man for who he really was. He was a pest, often filing complaints over very small and trivial things. We got three complaints mailed to us within the first two weeks of him moving in.\n\nWe all knew it was him. No one had a problem with the way we did these things until he moved in, and he and Dad have been going at it ever since.\n\nI thought maybe Dad would’ve forgotten about the beef between them, considering his new ailment. But I guess his mind insisted on prioritizing that memory over a lot of the others.\n\nOfficer Daniels soon gave us the visit he promised. It’s been almost a month since the crash happened, and by now Officer Daniels expected Dad to be able to answer some questions.\n\nMom went to open the door, and Officer Daniels seemed to have a puzzled look on his face. He greeted Mom then shot me a quick wave before stepping in. I waved back nonchalantly.\n\n“Mr. Blake around?” Officer Daniels asked Mom.\n\nShe nodded her head then called for Dad.\n\nDad came trotting into the kitchen moments later, right away greeting Officer Daniels with a firm handshake.\n\nI went to the living room, glancing behind me just in time to catch the two taking seats at the kitchen table. Mom leaned against the front door with her arms crossed.\n\nThere were seconds of silence until Officer Daniels broke it.\n\nI sat on the sofa and listened.\n\n“There’s something I didn’t inform you of the first time we met,” he started, “the other driver that was involved in the crash….there was no sign of them at the scene,”\n\nMore silence.\n\nI was a bit confused. As totaled as Officer Daniels said Dad’s car was, there was no way the driver could’ve just fled the scene uninjured.\n\n“What?” Dad said.\n\n“The car you collided with. There was no one in the driver’s seat when we arrived,” Officer Daniels replied.\n\n“But…how?” Dad said.\n\n“Now Mr. Blake, I need you to tell me as much as you can about what happened in the crash that night. Think. Try to remember something,” Officer Daniels encouraged.\n\nIt took a minute for Dad to reply.\n\n“I…really can’t recall much. The last thing I remember is braking my car to a screeching halt. Then waking up in the hospital. I can’t picture what the driver looked like at all,” Dad said.\n\nFrom there the questioning continued. Officer Daniels kept trying to squeeze explanations out of Dad, almost to the point of pressuring.\n\nAt one point in their conversation, Dad started to quiver and stutter when it came to questions that he could actually answer. I also noticed that his stories changed a lot, and he backtracked several things he’d said before. Dad did this quite often, and I could tell by the sound of Officer Daniels’s voice he was starting to have second thoughts about Dad.\n\nI had second thoughts too - about them both. I was still aware of the fact that Dad had suffered some brief trauma to his brain, so part of me just brushed off his strange stories as another side effect. \n\nSoon Officer Daniels went from asking simple questions to sounding like he was kind of interrogating Dad. He was getting a little aggressive with the questioning, and I think Dad may have been catching on.\n\n“So exactly when did you wake up in the hospital, again?” Officer Daniels asked.\n\n“I told you….me and the other driver collided and I passed out, then that’s when I woke up,” Dad explained.\n\nOfficer Daniels let out a giggle.\n\n“Earlier you said the last thing you remember is slamming on your brakes,” Officer Daniels reminded.\n\nI felt that Officer Daniels was holding something back. As if he already knew something else, and in a way, was trying to trick Dad into “confessing” something.\n\n“I think I’ve had enough questions for today,” Dad said.\n\nI let out a sigh of relief when I heard the kitchen door open and the sound of Officer Daniels stepping outside.\n\nOver the next couple weeks Officer Daniels would call our house non-stop, trying to get in touch with Dad. He never could. Whenever Officer Daniels would call, it was either mom or I who would pick up the phone because Dad would either be at work, or conveniently elsewhere. Even if Dad was home he never answered the phone. Every time he heard the phone ring he’d ask me to answer it instead, then walk out of the house.\n\nOfficer Daniels didn’t catch Dad one time during those phone calls. He even gave us a second visit. But Dad wasn’t around. He was willing to sit and wait for Dad to return, but hours had passed by, and Dad never showed up while Officer Daniels was there. \n\nIt was obvious Dad was trying to avoid being questioned again.\n\nOther than Dad's refusal to cooperate with the police, there was something else peculiar. While Dad was doing all he could to avoid Officer Daniels, our neighbor across the street was doing his best to avoid Dad.\n\nI first noticed one morning when Dad was leaving for work. Our neighbor just happened to be mowing his lawn. The first second he laid eyes on Dad coming out of the garage I could tell he was startled. The panic on his face told everything. He instantly cut the engine on the lawn mower and hauled it back into his garage, even though only half his lawn was cut.\n\nA few days later he was caught outside by Dad again as they were trying to check their mail boxes. Our neighbor stopped dead in his tracks, then spun around before rushing back into his house. He came back out again after Dad checked his mail first.\n\nThis went on for some time. Anytime our neighbor came outside and spotted Dad, he’d right away back off.\n\nMom wasn’t exactly right either. She was starting to become more withdrawn and less social. Especially around Dad. Her and Dad both used to greet me with small talk when I got home from school every day. That came to an end. \n\nSoon I was going home to almost complete silence, instead being greeted by what appeared to be my nervous and distraught mom.\n\nThen there was Dad, who always met me with a blank stare. The only communication I’d get from him after school was a bland,\n\n“Hi.”\n\nLike a robot devoid of any life or emotion.\n\nIf Dad was still in the house, Mom would spend a lot of days silently cleaning or sleeping upstairs in her room with the door shut. Anytime she came out of her room she would finally talk to me for short periods of time - only if Dad was out of the house. \n\nI sometimes went and listened to mom in her room, with my ear against the door. Most of the time I heard nothing unusual. At other times I swore I could hear her silently crying.\n\nOfficer Daniels gave us one last visit. Dad’s car wasn’t in the driveway so it was apparent Dad wasn’t around once again. He didn’t look happy. He had a, ‘now this is the last time’ type expression.\n\n“Hello once again Mrs. Blake,” Officer Daniels mumbled.\n\nMom glanced at me then pulled Officer Daniels into the living room. \n\nAgain I listened.\n\n“Mrs. Blake, your husband is about to become a suspect,” Officer Daniels said.\n\nThere was a lot of hostility in his voice.\n\n“What appeared to just be a simple accident at first, is now starting to become something else,” he continued, “Now what your husband told me is not matching up with the evidence at the scene.”\n\n“A suspect? Why, what’s going on?” Mom asked.\n\nShe was scared.\n\n“Well, we found your husband’s fingerprints inside of the other driver’s car,” Officer Daniels revealed.\n\nOfficer Daniels gradually became more vehement the longer he spoke. \n\n“Mr. Blake keeps dodging me and it’s only making things look more suspicious on his end,” he said, “Now I’m gonna call here again in a few days, and he’d better pick up. Then I’m gonna stop by here one final time, and he’d better be around. Or else I’ll get more officers to track him down and we’ll haul him into the police station and question him there!”\n\n“O-okay, Mr. Daniels. I’ll let him know what you said,” Mom stammered.\n\nOfficer Daniels came trotting out of the living room, then past me, before walking out the door.\n\nThat was the last we heard from Officer Daniels. He never did call our house again, or give us that final visit as he promised. It was like he’d abruptly forgotten about us, or maybe even vanished. \n\nIn the meantime I realized that our neighbor wasn’t leaving his house at all.  Not even to check his mail. It didn’t matter whether Dad was outside or not. His car had been sitting in his driveway for some days.\n\nI mean, he couldn’t be *that* afraid of Dad. Not after all these years.\n\nSoon we saw an ambulance truck along with two police cruisers parked outside our neighbor’s house. One of our other neighbors told my parents that he died.\n\nI started telling Kylie about what was happening. At this point she was the only person I had to talk to since mom had become some depressed soul, and Dad was acting like a robotic puppet.\n\nWhen I told her about our neighbor she was surprised, as she used to often see him out in his yard when she came to visit.\n\n“Well, now your dad won’t have to worry about bumping heads with him anymore,” Kylie said.\n\nKylie always found him to be a bit weird. And yeah, he was a male Karen. But I still didn’t wish death on anybody.\n\nOut of nowhere she thought of this bright idea of breaking into my deceased neighbor’s house just for the hell of it.\n\n“Maybe I should visit you more often, because clearly you’re losing your mind when I’m not around,” I told her.\n\n“Aww come on, the guy was way off. I’ve always wanted to know what did in that house all day when he wasn’t out in that yard,” Kylie replied.\n\nAfter some time of Kylie trying to convince me of why it was a good idea to break into the neighbor’s house, she failed to do so. However, she didn’t fail to convince me to go through with it anyway. \n\nDon’t ask me why, and don’t judge. I didn’t want to do it. But knowing Kylie, I just had a feeling that even if I didn’t stroll along with her, she would find some time to do it on her own.\n\nSo one night while Dad was at work, Kylie came to my house. While Mom was once again slouched away inside her bedroom, I met Kylie in my driveway. Then we scurried over across the street.\n\nWe went to the backyard then Kylie found a basement window. She drew a pocket knife and tried to pry a corner of the small window open. \n\nKylie finished cracking the window before sliding through and landing inside. I followed behind her. We were both thin girls so it wasn’t much of a struggle getting through.\n\nI turned my flashlight on and waved it around after landing inside the dark basement next to Kylie.\n\nDon’t worry. There wasn’t a dungeon down there or anything. No blood stains covering the walls, or outlines of dead bodies. Unlike Kylie, I’ve never thought our neighbor was *that* kind of guy. Besides the darkness of the basement itself, there was nothing creepy about the basement at all. It seemed to be just an ordinary place to kick back and relax in. \n\nWe snooped around the basement for a bit then made our way upstairs, deciding to keep the lights off in fear of someone outside noticing them.\n\nJust like the basement, the rest of the house looked, well - normal. Overall, the house was really neat and well kept, besides a sink full of dishes and an empty pizza box on the living room table. \n\nWhen we went to his bedroom the first thing we saw was an unmade bed with some scattered clothing. Kylie took her hand and ran through them, finding an opened playboy magazine sitting beneath.\n\n“I guess weirdos need excitement too,” she said, tossing the magazine to the floor.\n\n“Please, try not to touch much of anything else,” I whispered.\n\nI went over to the closet and started to pull the double doors apart, then stopped when I saw there was almost nothing in there. There were a few hangers and shirts, along with a very large picture sitting against the wall. It was almost large enough to cover the entire wall in the closet, and for the frame to touch the floor. The picture was just some generic stock photo of a dining room.\n\nKylie came to see what I was looking at. Then she pried the closet doors open even wider to get a better look. When she did that, the top of the picture started to slowly lean forward. I tried to catch it, but noticed a little too late. The picture hit the floor, falling flat on its face.\n\nWhen the beam of my light hit the bare wall from which the picture fell, we saw an outline on the wall.\n\nIt was a door.\n\n“You see this?” I asked Kylie.\n\nShe stepped inside the closet and pulled the door open.\n\nInside was another dimly lit room. Three monitors were mounted on the wall. A desk with a control panel that contained many buttons sat beneath the monitors. An office chair on wheels sat under the desk.\n\nAt the moment the monitors were turned off, but the buttons on the control panel were lit with white.\n\nI approached the control panel on the desk. There were two white arrows that pointed in opposite directions. Then there was one more lonely button in the corner of the control panel that contained a power symbol.\n\nI pushed the power button then right away all the monitors on the wall switched on. At first there was nothing but white static on the screens. But soon that disappeared, then Kylie and I saw something else being displayed.\n\nOn each screen was a view of a room. The left monitor looked like a bathroom. The middle monitor was a bedroom. The last was a living room.\n\nWe were looking at the inside of someone’s house.\n\n“The hell?” Kylie said, reaching forward and pressing one of the arrows.\n\nUpon pushing the button, a new sequence of rooms were displayed. She pressed the button several more times, displaying even more rooms with camera views from different angles.\n\nKylie stopped when she noticed something in particular.\n\n“Isn’t that your Dad’s car?” she asked.\n\nIt was the monitor on the left that showed us a glimpse of the outside through a window. We saw a driveway, and it was during the day time.\n\nKylie was right. The black car sitting in the driveway looked exactly like Dad’s.\n\nKylie hit the arrow again. For the first time we saw a person appear on one of the monitors. It was a woman, her back was facing the camera and it looked like she was in the bathroom. A bath towel was wrapped around her body.\n\nWhen the woman spun around and revealed her face, my jaws dropped.\n\n“Uh Kate….is that your mom?!” Kylie exclaimed.\n\nIt was.\n\nI stared in disbelief, watching my Mom on screen as she looked in the mirror. She left the sink then went to the bathtub, starting to undo the towel around her body.\n\nKylie quickly flipped to another sequence of footage before we could see the towel hit the floor.\n\n“Okay, that’s when I stop watching!” Kylie said.\n\nIn the next sequence we saw another person. This was a man. He just happened to be walking through the front door of the house.  \n\nAs Kylie flipped through more and more footage, I soon realized that it was my house on surveillance. Every room had been recorded at least once. Even the basement.\n\nThere were even recordings of Kylie and I up in my room. Some from months ago. Just like my Mom, there were recordings of *me* in the bathroom, stepping into the shower with nothing on.\n\n“What a creep!” I yelled, starting to get angry.\n\nIt was at that moment I started to regret my decision to break in there. \n\nSince when were there cameras in our house? When did the neighbor invade our home and plant them?\n\n“He’s not a murderer…but he is a pervert,” Kylie commented, flipping to yet another sequence.\n\nWe saw Dad on one of the monitors again - with Mom. They were both in the kitchen. Dad was just stepping in, and he had on his usual suit and tie. Just came home from work I suppose.\n\nMom was at the kitchen sink washing dishes, and it looked like she jumped at the sound of the kitchen door unlocking.\n\nThey exchanged a few words as Dad made his way over to Mom. As they spoke, Dad’s expression grew hostile. Then he suddenly started shouting in  Mom’s face. Mom started shouting back. That’s when Dad raised a hand and slapped Mom across the face.\n\nKylie gasped.\n\nMom fell to the floor, balling up and doing all she could to protect herself. Dad stood over and held a look on his face that I never thought I’d see him express. He was expressing pure anger. A look that made him look almost unrecognizable to me. \n\nMy eyes filled with tears. Then I glanced over and saw Kylie covering her mouth.\n\nI cried, thinking about the fact that Dad was doing this to my mom. The fact that he’d been doing this for some time and I was unaware of it. What was up with him? I’ve rarely ever seen him get angry, let alone like this.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, Kylie and I saw something even more daunting than that.\n\nThat menacing face Dad was holding started to turn into something much worse. Hair began sprouting from his cheeks, then his nose and mouth were twisting and contorting into something I couldn’t recognize right away. It looked like his face was gaining a snout that soon held many sharp and pointy teeth. Pointed ears on top of his head had replaced his human ones. At the same time, the rest of his body was also changing. His arms and legs were slowly elongating, making him just a tad bit taller, and his arms slightly longer.\n\nWithin seconds, Dad had become some hairy, monstrous, and wicked thing. Some animal-like creature standing on its hind legs - *in my house*.\n\nI was so distracted by his bodily transformation that I didn’t notice his green glowing eyes until seconds later.\n\nDad took a few steps towards Mom. She looked like she was screaming for her life, as she tried to crawl backwards to distance herself away from him. But Dad just kept creeping his way closer.\n\nKylie hit the power button before we could see what happened next.\n\nShe was on the brink of tears.\n\n“What the hell was that?!” Kylie exclaimed, pointing at the monitors.\n\nI didn’t know what to say.\n\n“What the hell is going on in your house?!” she continued.\n\nAt that moment it all made sense. This is why our neighbor suddenly became terrified of Dad. He saw…what Dad really was behind closed doors.\n\nWorst part is he couldn’t even call the police about it, as he’d have to tell them how he found out, and reveal his little perv cave he had going on. So he was stuck with no choice but to live with the knowledge that he was secretly neighbors with a literal monster.\n\nThis also explained Mom’s sudden change in behavior. She had to actually see this side of Dad in person.\n\nThere was a deafening screeching sound outside. Sounded similar to how I’d assume a banshee would sound. It was so loud I swore I felt the house slightly rumble.\n\nKylie and I glanced at each other.\n\n“I - I think it’s time to go,” I mumbled.\n\nWe headed back to my house and used my bedroom window as a way to smuggle ourselves in. We heard the loud screech again while climbing through. This time it sounded twice as terrifying.\n\n“What is that?” Kylie whispered. \n\nI shrugged my shoulders then went to glance out my window. I could see Dad turning in on our street.\n\n“Shit he’s coming!” I said.\n\nI tried to tell Kylie to go home, but she refused. She didn’t want to leave me behind knowing what was about to come in. She said she would stay overnight just in case anything happened.\n\nMy heart started racing when I heard the front door open downstairs, and the heavy thuds of work shoes. Mom let out a slight cry as Dad mumbled something. Then for the third time, there was that booming screech. This time it came from downstairs, *inside the house*.\n\nTears started to stream down Kylie’s face, as she backed away towards the window.\n\nWhen that screech went off for a fourth time that’s when I swung my bedroom door open and dashed downstairs.\n\n“Kate, wait!” Kylie whispered.\n\nThat was the last straw. Now knowing what was really going on, I wasn’t going to just lay back and allow my mother to be harmed - not anymore.\n\nDad put on a smile when he saw me. It was obviously just a facade.\n\n“Kate!” he said, “how’s my baby girl doing? What have you been up to all day while I’ve been at work?”\n\nMom tried her best to hide her terror, but her tear shrieked eyes and scrunched face was a dead give away. \n\nKylie crept behind me, then jumped when she laid eyes on Dad.\n\nDad laughed.\n\n“It’s the funny girl again! Kate, you didn’t tell me she was gonna be over,” he said.\n\nI had to get Mom out of the house.\n\n“Kylie and I need something from the store…a - and we need Mom to take us. Kylie is here because we’ve been working on something for school,” I lied.\n\nDad just kept smiling, and Mom’s eyes widened.\n\n“I can take you,” Dad said.\n\n“No, you just..got back from work I know you just wanna kick back,” I said.\n\n“It’s not a problem. I haven’t gotten comfortable yet, and most of the stores are still open for another two hours. So it’s not that big a deal,” Dad replied.\n\nHe just wouldn’t let it happen.\n\n“There’s certain things that I think Mom knows more about, and I think she’d be a bigger help,” I said.\n\nDad gasped then leaned against the kitchen counter before folding his arms.\n\n“Kate, whatever it is I’m sure I can be somewhat useful in, “ Dad insisted.\n\nOut of frustration, Kylie suddenly yelled,\n\n“NO! Just stop it!”\n\nI instantly started shushing her and trying my best to silence her. But she just kept going.\n\n“Stop it! Fucking stop it right it now!” She continued, ”You are not Mr. Blake! What are you?...What the fuck are you?!”\n\nDad just stared back, confused. His smile faded.\n\n“Uh Kate, are you oka - ” Dad started.\n\nBefore Dad could finish his sentence Kate charged at him while repeatedly screaming,\n\n“Shut up, you freak! Shut up!”\n\nDad pushed Kylie to the floor.\n\nMom gasped.\n\nKylie took off one of her shoes and threw it at Dad with all of her might. It hit him in the nose hard, causing his nose to drip with blood.\n\nThat right there is what set him off.\n\nDad’s “confusion” turned to anger, and he glared at Kylie with cold eyes, which soon started to glow green in a matter of seconds.\n\n“You bitch,” Dad said.\n\nAfter he said that, the hairless parts of his face started to sprout hair. His nails were replaced with razor sharp claws that were quickly starting to come in.\n\nHe opened his mouth and let out that familiar screech that probably would’ve burst my ear drums had I not covered my ears. I could see that he now had a mouth full of pointed teeth. Slowly his height was increasing by inches, as he took a few steps towards Kylie and I. At any minute I expected to see something that resembled the creature we saw in the footage.\n\n“You fucking bitch!” Dad yelled, his voice sounding a bit different now.\n\nMom ran and grabbed a frying pan on the stove before swatting Dad upside his head.\n\n“You leave them alone!” Mom cried, ready to strike him again.\n\nDad growled in pain before turning around and running one of his claws across her neck, slitting her throat wide open. Blood began to squirt across the kitchen table in front of her, as she dropped to her knees then flopped face first to the floor, a small pool of blood forming around her head.\n\n“Mom!” I cried.\n\nKylie screamed.\n\nDad turned to us again, then Kylie and I ran out of the house, splitting up and running in different directions. I didn’t even bother checking behind me. I just wanted to find somewhere to hide. I still had my flashlight in my back pocket, so I used it to see my way around my dark surroundings.\n\nThe first place I thought to go was the old shed in our backyard, as I knew it was empty and seldom used. If Dad were to come after me I figured this would be the last place he’d look - if he remembered it.\n\nWhen I got to the shed and swung the door open, I soon found out that the shed wasn’t going to be a good hiding place after all.\n\nI shined my light inside and almost screamed. I had to get a hold myself in case Dad was nearby. \n\nInside was a dangling human skeleton suspended on a hook. Bits and chunks of flesh were left behind in some areas of the body. I shined my light down to the floor only to find more flesh bits mixed in with scattered internal organs sitting in the middle of dried blood.\n\nThe horrid smell made me gag. In the middle of  blocking my nostrils, the beam of my flashlight catches a small pile of clothes sitting a few inches behind the suspended corpse. They were dark in color, maybe a navy blue or black. Something on the pile reflected a brief glare of light back to my eyes. I leaned in just a little bit closer and saw what it was.\n\nA badge - a police badge.\n\nI uncovered my nose and stared, eyes wide in disbelief as soon as I looked at the dangling corpse again and realized who it was…Officer Daniels.\n\nI heard Kylie scream from a distance, followed by another screech from Dad. Despite the screech and the scream sounding as if they were a good distance away, I glanced behind me only to see two glowing dots floating in darkness not too far away from where I was standing. Then there was a brief growl.\n\nRight away I dashed away from the shed and ran into the wooded area nearby. As I ran I was surprised to glance back and see that I wasn’t being chased. Dad just stood there and watched me get further away.\n\nI ran continuously, passing tree after tree, until I was out of breath. The plan was to reach the other side so then I could ask another neighbor for help. But when it got to the point where I started to see houses again, I saw those glowing eyes already waiting for me. So I had no other choice but to turn and run back into the woods again. I was baffled at how Dad was able to make it to the other side so fast. \n\nMy attempts at doing that in other directions resulted in the same. Dad would already be waiting, creeping towards me on all fours, snout caked with blood.\n\nSo now I’m stuck in this small neck of the woods, desperately trying to find a way out. I’ve been hiding for a few hours now, but I’ve been having to change my hiding spot often, as no matter where I go Dad is always nearby crawling and sniffing around, constantly getting closer. Every time I hear his low growls, or see his glowing eyes patrolling my area, I know it's time to move.\n\nHe’s already tried to lure me out by saying things such as,\n\n“Kate, sweetie I’m sorry….I got a little outta’ hand. Just come on out so we can take your mother to the hospital.”\n\nOr things like,\n\n“Katie come on, it's late. I have work in a few hours and you have school. It’s time to stop this now!”\n\nI don’t know how he’s doing it, but it seems that he is imitating the voices of people I know.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before I heard whispers from Kylie.\n\n“Hey Kate! I think your dad is gone now. You come on out so we can get out of here!”\n\nThat didn’t sway me either. Not only because Dad likely already killed Kylie, but also because Kylie was right - this thing is *not my Dad*. I’m pretty sure my real dad was killed in the accident. But whatever it was that got a hold of him that night, had also come after his friends and family…..And it was working on picking me off last.\n\nI believe “Dad” knows exactly where I’m hiding. It’s toying with me - playing with its food. It enjoys seeing me scared and in distress, feeding off every bit of my fear before it finally decides to go in for the kill. I’m just hoping I find a way out before it does. Or at least make it until dawn.",
