        "text": "Since we know now through Dr. Vegapunk, Devil Fruits are a manifestation of people's desire for change and evolution, wishes made real by the fruits' incredible abilities, could it be that Roger was responsible for creating Luffys fruit?!\n\nWe saw the Roger pirates on Laughtale, laughing about joy boys story and Roger mentioned \n\n\"I really wish i had been born in the same Era as you\"\n\nI would even say the Devil Fruit could be a part of the Treasure \"One Piece\" - a Fruit so powerful you can create whatever comes to mind! (of course with its limits)\n\nI also think that Roger told Whitebeard what he found on Laughtale and what you need to get the whole One Piece you need the Devil Fruit Hito hito no mi : Model Nika\n\nI would also go that far that Whitebeard maybe realised something about Luffy - his devil fruit is somewhat weird!\n\nWas this the reason whitebeard yelled the One Piece is real?!\n\nI don't know if Roger maybe knew about the Devil Fruit Origins - but it could be they found out on Laughtale.\nDid Roger tell shanks about it?! He should look out for a fruit, why was shanks so eager to get the Fruit Who's Who was protecting? As we know his crew has no devil fruit.\n\nRoger told him, he was too early for making a change in the world : \n\nPoseidn wasn't born\n\nJoyboy wasn't there/born\n\nSo maybe Shanks was on the way to find someone worthy of the devil fruit and being joyboy - finding out Luffy has the same characteristics as his old Captain maybe was a hint for him that he found his joyboy and this is the reason he is protecting Luffy!\n\nThis is a lot of Maybes and Could-bes but this is a little theory of mine",

Yamato's brief hesitation over wanting Kaido killed is pretty surprisingly realistic for a person that was abused by his father (can confirm).\n\nHell, as much as folks find the padding bad (and I agree a lot of it was bad) a lot of stuff from the Wano anime filler felt perfect for Wano that it makes me wish they are Canon. For example, the fun little bit of Chopper and Ussop fighting Big Mom (it's hopeless but it adds to Chopper's arc of becoming more sure of himself, plus him and Ussop are fun as a duo), and heck, more of Ussop just trying to protect Nami instead of being offscreened by Page One, plus more of Inu and Neko fighting Jack.\n\nLike damn, does anyone else agree? \n\nTLDR: While the padding could be bad, I actually like a lot of the additional filler scenes which I feel could've definitely made the manga better. I acknowledge it isn't canon (don't mind the title) but wow, if only lol.",

While some theorize they may still have \"eternal youth\" as rumoured (maybe via Akaini capturing Bonney that one time, to maybe use the fruit on them?) they can still die from whatever means, and this snack poison comment implies they can still die, and from a rather simple method.\n\nI don't think such a scene or dialogue would ever be used against an otherwise strong character like the emperors or admirals, unless someone is clever enough to put a devil fruit inside a meal where you won't notice it on a binge eat (like the way Luffy eats). \n\nThat said, the Elders may still be quite strong and even have powerful fruits and are taking extra caution, but to me the scene now reads more like they are indeed just political figures who are highly protected. If they were far stronger, then a scene of Kizaru trying to protect the Elder(s) from poison wouldn't be needed in the first place.",

Thats literally faster has a linear time-line. (By being faster than katakuri 5s  Kenbunshoku Haki.)\n\nWith his Kenbunshoku Haki kaido Probably would know if he got caught in a genjutsu, and with The same haki he would be Able to hit Madara at the exact point that Madara would dodge, Just like Ace did in the ligth novel against white beard.\n\nKaidou Already raised onigashima,With some Calculations we can know that onigashima is Probably Two times bigger than Madaras meteor \n\nAnd with conqueror's haki, any attack of mandara would even touch kaidou, and with ryou its gets worse. \n\n With his extremely powerful ryou, kaidou could damage Madara without even touching him.\n\nI know Madara is an extremely powerful, and have a lot of hax, but haki is a conceptual defense, which wouldn't let Madara even get close. With an involuntary borobreath kaidou destroyed a mountain, and naruto punch in the moon Just damaged The surface of The moon.\n\nI could be wrong but in my opinion kaidou wins.\n\n(Sorry for the English mistakes, it's not my mother Language)",

According to Kozuki Sukiyaki, when a sword becomes a black blade, its rank increases. This brings a question with it. \n\nWhen a non-black blade supreme grade sword (like Ace) becomes black blade, what will its classification be? \n\nIf Enma becomes a black blade, will it be the 13th Supreme Grade sword? If so, was Yoru a Great Grade sword before either? Or, was Yoru always a Supreme Grade sword and additionally it became black blade?\n\n\nWhat's your thoughts?",
