        "text": "I had a meeting with my manager the other day and we talked about how he measures performance. My manager said that we are measured on how many tickets we do in a month and how that compares to other members of the team. In addition, how many times our tickets fail testing, product review, etc... And he also told me that I'm evaluated based on my soft skills and how I get along with other people. Everything was very technical and the objectives were intended to be measurable.\n\nI left that conversation feeling dehumanized because my existence as a worker is basically reduced down to numbers and how I'm useful to the company as a whole. It's a very corporate mindset that I don't quite agree with. As a software engineer, I've never been measured this way in all 7 years that I've been working and it has, frankly, left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nAt my last job, I worked together with my manager and created goals and objectives when I first started working there. And, throughout the year, we checked in to those objectives and see if I met them or not. At the end of the year, we worked together to rate my performance based on those objectives. So the culture at my previous company was a more people-friendly culture whereas the culture at my current company is a profit-driven culture. I've never been forcefully prescribed performance and with such exact precision before. It makes me feel like I'm a cog in a system rather than a human being, to be honest.\n\nAm I being too sensitive here or is this how most corporate companies treat their employees? And, if it's not me, then how can I change this?",

        "text": "Currently in the job market and I’m confused about which roles I should be seeking. I’m looking for a position that is a combination of data analyst, Python developer, and data engineering. My previous work experience of seven years involved all three as it was a small financial company and I wore many hats to compensate for the lack of resources. My position title was “Research Analyst” but in reality it was a mix of everything. Because it was a small company and lacking resources, a lot of our tools were built in-house using Python, whether it was creating dashboards or working with visualization tools. \n\nI did projects that dealt with data analytics (regression, correlation, cleaning data, and other types that not too deep into stats), created a rudimentary sentiment analysis model based on NLP, web scraping (Python’s beautifulsoup and Selenium) and building API-like code to connect to public databases, automating manual tasks using Python and VBA, and creating/maintaining/scaling backend databases (SQL). I mostly enjoyed the web scraping projects, building custom code to pull data from websites, and automating processes but I’m aware there aren’t jobs dedicated to just that. Data analysis was sometimes enjoyable too.\n\nWhen I go on LinkedIn, I have a hard time looking for roles that fit my interest as most positions are either distinctly data analyst or data engineer or software engineer. There were very few software engineer positions that involved web crawling and process automation. I applied to a lot of senior data analyst roles, data engineer/DevOps, and software engineers but most of the time I am not qualified enough and get rejected. For data engineer roles, most ask for AWS or Azure knowledge and other particular set of skills fit for DevOps, whereas data analyst roles require Tableau or Power BI which I never used. Of course software engineering roles are mostly out of my league.\n\nAre there particular jobs that would fit my interest, or am I doomed and have to pick one of the three roles and try to learn new skills/tools for that role?",

I've been waiting for a promotion to a full-time position for half a year but have been repeatedly told that due to the shaky situation at the company, there's a freeze on hiring juniors.\n\nRecently, one of the senior engineers decided to leave, and my manager asked him to pass to me his responsibilities. When I talked to my manager about finally becoming a full-time employee due to being given this new responsibility, I was told that there is still no green light to hire me due to the hiring freeze, but she will try to talk to her manager, with no promises.\n\nOn one hand, it frustrates me that I'm being given new responsibilities without being compensated for them, especially as an intern. On the other hand, should I just be grateful for the opportunity and keep quiet, with the hope of being hired soon?\n\nI have thought about telling my manager that I'm willing to take on this responsibility, but only if I'm promised a full-time position within one month. Otherwise, I will give up this role.\n\nWhat do you guys think? What would you advise me to do?",

If ChatGPT and other code writing software become good enough, surely one developer can do the job of two or maybe even three developers.

        "text": "Good morning, I have been working in software development for 2 years under an apprenticeship contract. I mainly worked in small consulting firms (with 20 or fewer employees) whose core business is acquiring and developing projects for clients as quickly as possible.\n\nExamples are administration or notification panels for their mobile apps, maintenance apps for their internal workers, management web apps for a clinic, some Internet of Things mobile and web apps to send commands to remote devices or fetch smart keys and open smart locks.\n\nFurthermore, the company where I currently work is positioned in the IT market as a third-party software provider. When we acquire a client, someone establishes a budget and time estimate for the project. Once the client signs a legal contract, we work as contractors, billing hours and setting deadlines to deliver the project as quickly as possible. We are merely shadows, executors and can’t even promote ourselves because all our repositories and code bases are owned by the client and are subject to their agreements.\n\nEvery activity, no matter how minimal, has been planned. We avoid doing even the smallest refactoring that does not directly benefit the client because it would take up valuable time. As a result, things that provide value to developers, such as flexibility, maintenance, and legibility, are often considered unnecessary. We also work as external software employees for large companies to provide support due to their high internal turnover and to reduce costs.\n\nThere are no Human Resources Department or Marketing Department, we are all technical kind people. My colleagues and work environment are good, and we use modern technologies, but they vary greatly from project to project. Some projects use Android, others use Flutter or React Native. Some use Angular, React, or Node.js. Some projects use microservices with Docker and Amazon Web Services, while others are monolithic. Some projects use .NET, others use TypeScript, and some use relational databases while others use document-oriented databases. Other use mono repo solutions while others have multiple repository. I feel that I am growing horizontally as a developer because I am exposed to a lot of different technologies, but not vertically because I only work on each project for the duration of its development cycle before moving on to a new project with a new technology. To be successful working on multiple projects, we all need to strive to be full-stack developers.\n\nWe have no documentation for the project except time estimates and billing hours. To understand how it works, we need to examine the code and ask around. No one has a complete understanding of how it works, and we often work on some services or providers without knowing the full context. There is no formal training; we have to learn by studying the code, without any courses or specialization. Often, we don’t even get to see the final product because clients don’t tell us how to use their APIs or they change their minds. Estimates are based on the client’s budget, and developers are not heavily involved. \n\nIs all IT industry like this? Could an IT product-based company be handled differently? Could a job in the public administration within the IT industry offer a less stressful and more controlled environment? I don’t care about getting more and more money, my main values are keep learning, reliability, prudence, support, in-depth analysis, modelling, testing, get the thing work correctly, focus on details, best practices, see a project to its end and make a product better by fixing bugs. I would like to speak and listen about inner mechanisms of a software and really hate listening to time, budget and working days estimate and billing hours. I think billing is crucial but there should be other values as well. I think I haven’t a suitable attitude because I am not an entrepreneurial and consultant kind of person.",

I will be mid-junior by then and want to know if internships are generally remote or I have to move for them or if employers provide temp housing or how that works. I have also heard of CS students having to leave their campus apartments for the summer semester to intern so I have to decide to renew my lease for a calendar year or academic year. Is there an internship meta guide somewhere here?",

I search all relevant places in my country, my cv is pretty much the best i can write without lying (I got help from a professional and this sub.) Built 5 big projects (3 of them fullstack) and a dozens of small ones.       \n\n\\-Barely got any phones. where im located it feels like pretty much 99% of the companies wont hire new grads.     \n\n\\-I managed to get a developer position last nov (crm, low pay), but after 2 weeks i was asked to work in a place where its 5 hours commute total a day, i refused and had to leave.       \n\n\\-Beside that i had 3 intreviews, failed them all.    \n\nI guess i can keep trying and applying like i am now, and in the end maybe ill get a developer job, like i managed to do last nov. but i got 2 problems right now: I feel like im rotting everyday in my apartment and its just fucks my mental health so hard, and the second problem is i can support myself like that for the next month max, im out of money.          \n\nI decided to try and get jobs that are easier to get, and had an intreview for a techinal support position. this is for a company that got a platform to build websites, and you basically get calls from clients needing help with that. also, from time to time you train customers at the office to use the platform.      \n\nThey said to me, and also wrote it in the job description, that theres a possibility to get promoted to the developers team after 1 year. obviously it depends how good you are.      \n\nThe pay is really good in my opinion, obviously not developer salary, but good. benefits and such are meh, working hours 9-18 from office.          \n\nBig downside is that due to long training, if i quit in the first year i got to pay a penalty (around 50% of the monthly salary.)          \n\nDo you think i should take it? The good points are:     \n\n\\-Getting a good income. going out.      \n\n\\-working at a tech company, maybe get a developer position there after a year.           \n\nThe bad points:      \n\n\\-Working at least for a year at a position where i dont even have to have a degree, after busting my ass 3 years at school. I know i shouldnt think like that but i just knows ill feel like such a loser.        \n\n\\-If they wont give me a developer position after an year maybe ill never manage to get such position, because who will want to hire someone that got 0 developing experience like 18 months after graduating?",

He’ll come up with something great and implement it well. \n\nIf I need refactoring or cleanup or maintenance - he just procrastinates and it doesn’t get done, leading to either my sweeping up behind him, an unhappy confrontation or technical debt. It’s limiting also because larger projects; even if they’re interesting to him; go to crap because he can’t manage focus for the time required  to complete leading to a lot of his stuff only getting 60% done before he stops treating it rigorously.\n\nThe old man in me is going: “Stop being such a lazy, entitled little brat! Part of development includes the boring stuff. Throw on some music, close out the world and get to it!”\n\n\nBut recently I’ve been watching him really try to do this stuff and struggle. Like it will take him 2-3 days to do a maintenance style task I can do in a few hours — and he’ll do it wrong. (He’s very smart, it’s not beyond him intellectually.)\n\nSo I’ve started to think that maybe he has some kind of cognitive difficulty. He’s got a lot of other strange personal traits too - maybe they’re related? If he’s got some kind of ADD, ADHD, Asperger’s or something like that it’s a totally different picture. I’m wondering if there are any devs out there who are like my young friend here, or have worked with them who can give me any insight on how to best help him and get the most out of him.",

I have done a good amount of personal projects including a portfolio site. I know an internship is not essential to get a job but I know it helps a large amount. I would not mind doing an internship after graduation but most companies only hire internships for current students, at least that is how I read the listings. I do have an opportunity to build a web application for the small town of 1,700 people I live in. It would just require a small static site but would building that and being put on payroll or as an independent contractor amount to something of an internship? \n\nSo in summary: \n\nAre internships mostly locked to current students?\n\nWould building that site amount to anything as far as experience for jobs? I have personal projects. \n\nAny other tips for better opportunities getting a job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

As well as game dev in general. I am not saying that’s what I want to pursue but it’s something that interests me. I think that’s why I chose CS initially, but I honestly don’t remember. But I am also failing to see how learning Java linked structures and abstract data types will apply to games. Which I get is probably cause I am still in the basic stuff but it would be nice to know if there was some way to apply the things I’ve learned so far to games. \n\nBut ultimately I can’t really remember why I chose CS.  I tried some other career paths before but it never went anywhere. I am afraid that I may have chosen cs on a whim or something maybe. I am just feeling super lost right now and need some help in trying to figure out how to get through this. Cause I don’t want to quit, I don’t want to fail at yet another thing. I am already behind in life and can’t afford to get more bogged down.\n\nAnyone else went through something similar during their undergrad? How did you find your interest in the subject? How did you reframe these concepts in such a way that you had an eagerness to learn about them?\n\nWhatever it is I need help in trying to figure out how to actually be interested in all this. I feel like if I grab a hold of that eagerness it will be a little easier for me to push through the struggle of understanding the course material. \n\n\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "I graduated last month and I’m curious to hear from experienced front-end developers, what are some “complicated” tasks on the front end side of things? In college, I spent most of my free time getting good with CSS. I’m very comfortable writing a UI from scratch and getting layouts exactly how I want them. Yet, no matter how complex my static sites get, the most JavaScript I tend to do is just a little hamburger button for the nav menu or something minor like that. Perhaps, I should try a project with a lot more DOM manipulation. Long story short, could you guys provide some examples of how complex JavaScript can get on the front-end? Sometimes, I don’t feel like a “software engineer” when I do front-end stuff. Again, most of my experience with it has been design and layout related. Either way, I’ll be full-stack eventually. Rarely, do I ever see a job posting that is strictly front-end.",

I don't have any background knowledge, and I have a degree in International Economic Development. I'm pretty new to coding and UX design (a couple of months, but on and off for a year). I've mostly been learning through online resources and trying to build my portfolio. \n\nThe boot camps are super expensive, and I'm not in the greatest position to invest in a boot camp. \n\n I'm worried that I won't get any offers if I were to have some experience under my belt. Also, there have been a lot of layoffs which also makes me question if I'm making the right decision.  \n\nSidenote: I do have two part-time jobs as a source of income currently (to note that I'm not 100% dependent on becoming a developer).
