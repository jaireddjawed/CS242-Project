I remember searching answers as to why childhood friends have a tendency to lose and I came across an interesting article breaking down people who meet at a certain age somewhere around 3-6 (quite a big gap but I can't remember the exact numbers) will view each other as family. Leading to them having a more of a family bond than a romantic bond. While kids past that age are more likely to be able to from a romantic bond.

Also they couldn't prove it to be falsifiable, i.e. \"if you don't feel your white privilege, you have it\" sounds very circular-logic'y  and reminds a lot of \"you have to feel Jesus in your heart, to understand it. And until you do, there is no sense for reason.\". I've went to Wikipedia and other sources and haven't found any way in which \"White Privilege\" can be measured and how it is a falsifiable concept. One of the things people keep alluding to is historical background, but it is never an evidence of present condition, it's subject to interpretation and still is not really scientific. Sometimes they point at financial inequality (which makes US actually a country of Asian privilege then, as it is the most affluent racial group). Can someone please cite works or just reply in a way to see how \"white privilege\" can be measured and how is it falsifiable? Seems to be a concept from Social Science, so who else could answer this question better than Social Scientists. Thank you. ",

        "text": "So after spending Part II (on Capitalism) talking endlessly about the importance of innovation, growth, creative destruction, the importance of evolution-like selection for the above, incentives related to the above, etc. we get to Part III (on Socialism). Suddenly all these things are forgotten and his analysis completely ignores every single aspect that was analyzed in the previous part. This reaches comical levels, with one paragraph for example beginning \"Suppose that a new and more efficient piece of machinery has been designed for the productive process of industry X.\" Where did this efficiency gain actually came from? Who cares! There are many other such weaknesses (eg re: the calculation problem and the price mechanism) but there's no reason to enumerate them.\n\nI don't find temporary amnesia to be a good explanation, so there must be another one. My edition has an introduction by a Thomas K. McCraw, who writes:\n\n&gt;Schumpeter begins part III, \"Can Socialism Work?\" with another strong assertion: \"Of course it can.\" But a close examination of what follows may lead the attentive reader to conclude that he really means \"Of course it can't.\" His statement is hedged about with so many far–fetched conditions and qualifications—all presented with a bland mock sincerity–that his argument drifts imperceptibly into irony and even satire. \n\nOn this point he is right. But his explanation is the following: Schumpeter wanted to appear sympathetic to socialist readers so that they would keep reading and absorb the message of the rest of the book.\n\nI don't like that explanation. First of all, Part III starts on page 160. Schumpeter has already launched some pretty heavy attacks on socialism in Part I, which would have turned them away right at the start of the book. Additionally, the most important bits are _before_, not _after_ Part III so it hardly matters that much if the socialists keep reading.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any good alternative hypotheses myself, so I turn to you. What did Schumpeter mean by his deliberately weak take on socialism?",

The major technical skills of the discipline: such as reading and writing ethnographies, running the statistics that are common in the field, and GIS stuff. \n2. The more theoretical aspects of the disciplines: what are the key paradigms, theories, and questions? \n3. Interesting research results from the disciplines: What are the cool studies? \n\nI could just google \"Intro text to ...\" but I am not sure if that will work. In history, I never read an \"Intro text to History\", but instead would read different monographs and listen to the explanations of the professors. A lot of the more theoretical stuff I only found out by taking some grad courses in the field. I am not sure if this will be true for the social sciences more generally.\n\nMy interest was actually sparked by the methodological and theoretical works I read in History, particularly about the influence of Geertz and the new economic history, along with reading Tilly's work on state formation.\n\nSo does anyone have any recommendations or advice? Particularly for [3], since I assume that [1-2] will probably be in introductory text books (even if they are woefully incomplete). If my interests help narrow it done, I am really interested in the formation of the state and institution building more generally. \n\nI would guess the most useful things would be reading lists for introductory courses, theory courses, and methodology courses, and maybe graduate courses covering the same. \n\nMathematically, I can do ANOVAs but have had virtually no opportunity to practice them and have not done linear regressions. \n\n(By the by, I recognize that no one will be able to answer all of these, since I named five disciplines with three different components, but if you could just help with one, that would be very helpful.)",

So why do all photos of China from that period look so....pleasant?

I mean, it obviously doesn't look like a developed country, but photos of Delhi, Calcutta, Dhaka or some random African capital from that period scream \"yeah, now this IS extreme poverty allright\" while people in the China photos just look like they have a very modest standard of living.

My study support teacher claimed that in Islamic culture, Muslims don't eat with their left hand, and that young people don't make eye contact with their elders, or something along those lines. I was initially sceptical, given that the Muslim world is a very diverse community, and i thought the statement sounded like it was generalising. We talked to my Support teachers Muslim Co-worker, and she agreed with the statement. I don't know if this is a general thing or if it's specific to a certain country or region where Islam is the predominate faith. \n\nThis experience has made me curious as to how much different cultures can differ. I've lived in a western country my whole life, and i don't know much about what it's like to live somewhere else or about different cultures. I'd love to learn more about different countries and regions, and tribal cultures would also be interesting. I also want to do a lot of creative writing, and i want to create made up cultures. \n\nSo the kind of things i'd like to know about are: \n\n. How does body language and courtesy differ by culture?\n\n. What are the Taboos of different cultures? \n\n. How do gender roles and gender signifiers differ by culture? \n\n. When does a boy become a man and a girl become a women? \n\n. What are the dress norms?\n\n. How do different cultures view the rest of the world?    \n\n. How do different places view the role of government and other institutions? \n\n. How do cultural and social attitudes differ when it comes to any issue? \n\n. What are the different mores and customs, and how to they differ? \n\n. Does morality and ethics differ across different cultures?\n\n. How does art, music, and other creative mediums differ across culture?  \n\n. Is there something i have left out here, and if so how does that differ across culture? \n\nA book that can introduce me to cultural differences and how human cultures would be really good. ",

A few of them responded with the typical idea of God: an intelligent, powerful being who loves all humans and helps humans in times of need. Others merely applied \"God\" as a label to various phenomena that nowhere resembles the biblical idea of a God. For example, some people define God as \"whatever came before the Big Bang\", \"whatever existed before time\", \"anything that created our universe's energy\", \"any idea that makes you feel like your life has meaning\", \"that which gives us logic, numbers, love, etc\", \"existence\", \"everything\", etc.\n\nFor me, \"God\" is strictly what's written in the bible. An advanced alien civilization that performs what we consider \"miracles\" would not be Gods. If He didn't create Earth and judge humans from heaven, then that shouldn't be called \"God\".\n\nHas there been studies on how theists or atheists define \"God\"?
