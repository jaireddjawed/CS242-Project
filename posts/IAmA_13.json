        "text": "Let me make you familiar with the top websites that help you book the cheapest domestic and international flights all year round. \n\n**The Best Flight Search Engines**\n\n|**Top Websites**|**Pros**|**Cons**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Skiplagged|Find insanely cheap flight deals, track flight prices|No options for cheap business or first-class tickets |\n|Agoda|Finding dirt-cheap flight deals,   booking flights and accommodations (including homestays) in one place|Cheapest flights have long layovers|\n|Hopper|Monitoring flight prices, mobile app capability |Not 100% reliable, not suitable for flights you need to book instantly |\n|Momondo|Excellent deals on international itineraries |Slow load times |\n|Skyscanner|European flights, unique toggling abilities|Mediocre load times, lots of ads on the page |\n|Kayak|Discounted flight and hotel   packages|Disorganized website layout|\n|Google Flights|Fast load times, search multicity flights, ability to toggle by flight preferences |Doesn't always find the lowest fare available |\n|Priceline|Best price guaranteed, cheap hotel and travel bundles|Slow load times, confusing website |\n|Southwest|Southwest flights, two free checked bags |Unable to compare prices across other airlines |\n|Scott's Cheap Flights|Rare flight deals, only displays reputable airlines |Limited-time offers only, specific destinations and dates |\n|Expedia|Easily book complete travel packages including events |Cancellation policies can be difficult to understand |\n|Orbitz|Rewards program lets you earn additional rewards on all bookings |Rewards expire after one year |\n|Hotwire|Offers travel insurance (for an additional fee) |Filtering options not as robust as other flight search engines |\n|Travelocity|Price match guarantee and a $50 coupon toward your next trip |Cancellation policies not always clear and transparent |\n|CheapOair|If you're interested, speak to a travel expert over the phone |Charges agency booking fees |\n|VaccationTravel|Facilitates booking both on website or through an expert over call, deep –discounts on reservations throughout the entire year, and special deals on festivals and holidays.|Special deals only for limited time period.|\n|The Fare Hub|Offers everything from flights to holiday packages, hotels, and car rentals at wholesale prices. Travel experts available 24/7 through a phone call to help the customers make reservations, changes, and cancelations. |Limited-time deals expire soon. |\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Verdict** \n\nVaccationTravel and TheFareHub are two websites for both international and domestic flight bookings. This is because these two websites offer discounted flight deals and special offers on reservations throughout the entire year. The booking process becomes far easier with the travel experts available on call to help you at the time of bookings as well as even during or after the trip (in case of any problem). \n\n**Tips to help you score cheap flights**\n\n1. Fly Budget Airlines: Most of the search engines do not show regional and budget airlines. The airlines such as Spirit and Frontier are the popular budget airlines that serve many domestic routes. With budget airlines, you can easily find cheap flights. However, you may need to pay for upgrades liked checked bags, meals, or preferred seat selection. The best budget airlines include:\n\n· Southwest Airlines\n\n· Allegiant Air\n\n· Frontier Airlines\n\n· Sun Country Airlines\n\n· JetBlue\n\n2. Make reservations in advance: Don’t wait until the last second to make your flight reservations. The most ideal time is to book a flight to your destination 2 or 3 months in advance before your departure. If you are planning to visit some destination during its peak time, you must book your flight at least 5 months earlier. For example: New York remains in its best festive mood in November and December with Thanksgiving followed by Christmas and New Year. If you want to visit New York City in December, you must book your tickets around July and August to score the most budget-friendly flight prices. \n\n3. Take flight at odd hours: When you don’t to reach your destination at a particular time, you can choose to travel at odd hours. Just be okay traveling too late or too early, and you may end up scoring an unimaginably [**cheap flights**](https://www.vaccationtravel.com/) deal. They say that early bird gets the worm; the best time to book on any given day is around 5 a.m. to find the lowest price deal. \n\n4. Look for the cheapest day: Monday through Wednesday, if you book your flight tickets at midnight, you are likely to save more on your flight tickets.\n\n5. Be flexible with travel dates:  Check prices for the entire month and pick your travel date when fare is the cheapest. Browse through VaccationTravel or TheFareHub, and simply, feed in your departure and arrival cities. Check for a one-way price. Do not enter a date – instead, select the whole month.  You will get to know the date that offers the cheapest fare. Once you have checked for a one-way price, don’t forget to check the return ticket prices in the same manner. You can get a better deal by being flexible with travel dates.\n\n6. Make reservations for the place that offer cheap flight fares: This trick will only work if you don’t have a particular holiday destination in mind. Use search engines to enlist the places that offer cheap flight fares. You can then freeze a destination that meets your budget as well as matches closer to your interest. \n\n7. Set Fare Alerts: When you visit the flight booking websites, do not forget to set fare alerts. Follow VaccationTravel or TheFareHub on social media (Facebook and Twitter) to learn about the special offers, helping you to make the most of those offers before they sell out or get over. \n\n**If you have any travel-related questions, I would love to answer them in the comments section below.** **Don’t let expensive airfare hold you back anymore!** \n\n**Love,**\n\n**Cooper**",

But I am super grateful to have Sam Altman as my investor. The dude has a heart of gold, and is the most intellectually aware person as to what is coming with AI.\n\nMy project may fail, as airbnb raised 6.4 billion and I only was able to raise 5k, but I strongly recommend everyone try out OpenAI's new stuff if they are considering building a business like me.\n\nIdeally, I would need to raise 1.5-2 million to get this to generate revenue, but I didn't want to come out asking for so much. Although it would be nice to raise that much.\n\nHope you guys enjoy the demo!",

My research is on developing an intervention to help staff who work on mental health wards for teenagers to deliver compassionate care and to have reduced compassion fatigue (when people have reduced ability to be compassionate). \n\nI love to share psychology ideas. I produced a podcast about cognitive behavioural therapy called Let’s Talk About CBT for several years, and I’ve written articles for The Guardian, and The Times and books for adults and children. My most recent book is called A Year To Change Your Mind and is about how ideas from psychology and psychological therapy can be useful for all of us day to day.

        "text": "\nHey Reddit! There’s a lot I want to touch on to paint a thorough picture. I’ll try to approach this chronologically while being as concise as possible and I’ll leave a quick summary at the end.\n\n**Weightloss/Fitness:**\n\nFrom late 2016 to summer 2017, I lost around 220 lbs by changing my eating habits and drastically increasing my physical activity. Entirely ceasing going out and ordering food in favor of making my meals at home allowed me to control what was going into my food, in particular, salt content and added sugar. I spent about an hour each day, sometimes more, either walking or working out at the gym, just becoming used to which exercises felt most comfortable since I didn’t have an end goal regarding a specific weight. I didn’t have a nutritionist or trainer to guide me, the gym became a routine way of holding myself accountable for something. \n\nI shared my weight loss on Reddit on [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/730zpu/410_to_190_a_5_year_journey_well_worth_enduring/). I was contacted by over 100 users looking for insight on what it took to remain committed, and I explained that you don’t start losing weight with the intention of losing that much as it’s an intimidating number. You attack it in chunks aiming for something as small as 5 lbs here and there and making small changes incrementally, allowing for sustained and sizeable impact. I don’t consider myself a figure of authority so instead of telling people what to eat or exercises to do, I try to help them discover the spark that initiates to desire to change and let that drive their unique goals. Someone from Yahoo Fitness saw my post and interviewed me for [a Yahoo News piece ](https://www.yahoo.com/news/exercise-tip-avoid-loose-skin-28-year-old-lost-regained-lost-220-pounds-164851118.html). I went on to appear on the [Rachael Ray show](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrCheyl/comments/zlyk4a/stefan_trotman_rachael_ray/)  a couple of months later to talk a bit more about my journey up until that point. I’ve since taken part in and completed a variety of [road races as well as Spartans.](https://i.imgur.com/dQMzLBH.jpg)\n\n**Kidney Donation:**\n\nIn 2016 I learned through an NPR podcast that of the 100,000 people in need of an organ in the US that close to 90% of them were for kidneys. Organs from living donors last on average twice as long as those from deceased. At the time, I was still over 400 lbs but in February 2019 having lost most of that weight, I registered my interest with New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell in New York to be an organ donor. 60 days later, after undergoing thorough physical and psychiatric evaluations, I donated my kidney to a stranger. I sent a card with the organ transport for the recipient, simply saying there’s no pressure to reach out to say thank you. A couple of months later I received [this letter from the recipient.](https://i.imgur.com/BlPX3j8.jpg) The surgery lasted about three and a half hours, I was discharged after two and a half days, and back to work six weeks later, free of complications. \n\nBefore my surgery and after extensive research and internal inquiries, I learned that New York City, which I was an employee of as a civilian member of the NYPD, had no organ donor paid leave policy. even though New York State does, which mirrors a Federal policy however these policies only apply to New York State and Federal employees, respectively. I planned to lump together whatever vacation and sick leave I’d saved to get me through my recovery. The New York Daily News [published an article](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-nypd-employee-kidney-transplant-living-organ-donor-lead-20190513-r4youtscgrcdrowelfq7vj7x3q-story.html) regarding the absence of supportive donor policy. The very next day, I was contacted by the NYPD and assured they would provide paid leave because thought my actions were commendable and in line with their mission. Later that year, the Policewomen Endowment Association awarded me [Humanitarian of the year](https://i.imgur.com/L7wc1b9.jpg). \n\n**Liver Donation:**\n\nUsing the kidney donation as a point of reference, in August 2021, I registered with NYPWC as an interested liver donor candidate. Though a small number compared to people in need of Kidneys, I knew the need was still present for living liver donors and I felt physically and mentally equipped.  In November of 2021, I notified the NYPD that I met the criteria to donate a part of my liver and would like to arrange similar accommodations to those that followed my kidney donation two years prior. I was given written, signed, and verbal reassurance that I would be taken care of. Around the same time, I was asked by the NYPD to attend a sanctioned [organ donor-related event](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nypd-organ-transplant-donation/) to engage with the media and advocate for donors.\n\nAfter seven hours in March of 2022, my surgery was successfully completed and the portion taken of my liver was transported nearby to Colombia in New York and attached to the recipient. I sent a card with the same sentiment expressed to the kidney recipient wishing them the best of luck and that my only wish is that they strive to live as abundantly as possible. I was discharged after three days but was much slower to resume everyday life given the extent of the surgery and the liver needing time to regenerate. \n\nA month after surgery, I was notified by someone in payroll that I had been placed on unpaid leave which I found odd since I was promised the leave would be taken care of. I attempted to contact the individual that drafted the letter for my leave but after unreturned calls and emails, I visited the NYPD office and days after the final document [had been signed](https://i.imgur.com/W1Zbblm.jpg). Even with the signed approval, after months of internal misalignment, negligence, and apparent incompetence, I was denied the paid leave. When I returned to work in July I had missed four paychecks due to the mishandling of the matter I inquired and was once again given reassurance the matter would be resolved. Missing one paycheck tends to be fine, most people can adapt, but missing four bears a massive financial and mental impact. \n\nIn August, on three consecutive days, I was made aware a final decision had been made, and the leave back pay would not be issued. I was then notified I was the subject of an internal investigation regarding misuse of company time by clocking out 3 minutes early on various instances. An allegation I’ve since determined had no merit and was done for no other reason than to induce discomfort. Lastly, the hiring department informed me that I would be terminated because I had not attempted the civil service exams associated with my position. All of the clauses the NYPD cited for my dismissal were present at the time of my kidney donation, yet they acted swiftly to remedy the situation then but pivoted to attacking in this instance. I resigned from the job at the end of August, my mental health was deteriorating quite rapidly, and remaining in an institution that mistreated me this way felt subservient.\n\nI applied for unemployment the next day, and on 12/7/22, the department of labor ruled I was ineligible to collect weekly benefits because I left the job with good cause. They had been provided all documentation to support my actions but, after taking comment from the NYPD, [denied my claim.](https://i.imgur.com/vqqZmSE.jpg)\n\n**In clear air:**\n\nIf I knew before my liver surgery what would transpire following it, I would have still gone through with it. I will not and cannot let the possibility of adversity deter others from being helped. To imagine living a diminished life because you need dialysis, or weekly treatments, to imagine a family rallying behind a loved one fighting to make it to the day they get the call that they’ve been matched with a donor, is unthinkable for most of us. I’ll continue to speak on behalf of living donors, and people in need, and share my story in hopes it resonates with someone and sparks an idea within them. We’ve all needed help at some point, the mechanism behind these surgeries is no different from offering a friend a ride home or lending someone a pen. Doing something to help a person in need gives them better odds of overcoming some form of detriment. \n\n\nI’m not great with welcoming help, let alone asking for it. Just before posting this AMA [I made a GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/double-organ-donor-denied-promised-paid-leave?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1), and if anyone at all would like to donate, it would be received with extreme gratitude as I continue applying for jobs in pursuit of my next role.\n\n\n**Living Organ Donor Resources**\n\n[National Kidney Donation Organization](https://www.nkdo.org)\n\n[Waitlist Zero](http://waitlistzero.org)\n\n[New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Living Liver Donation](https://www.nyp.org/transplant/liver-transplant/living-donor-liver-transplant)\n\nSummary: After losing 200 lbs, and donating my kidney and a part of my liver on separate occasions, my former employer the NYPD failed to make good on their promise to provide paid leave and instead created a hostile work environment even after they’d previously highlighted the unique nature of my actions. This resulted in four missed pay periods, I was met with hostility once I returned to work and left shortly after to take care of my declining mental health. I continue to support and mentor those seeking to become living organ donors because the preservation of life is worth it. \n\n[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/KNrWHB6.jpg)\n\nAdditional proof submitted to mods",
