For me, it's an absolute alien concept to read visualizing things. \nFor me, good writing is not made up 100% of imagery and descriptive info dumps. But I prefer books that focus on the plot, action, and dialogue. \nReading descriptive writing is unbearable. I prefer simplistic writing, it is more manageable. Action, dialogue and plot are the main draws.\nAlso, as I don't get distracted by mental imagery, a good rhythm and vocabulary in prose, playing with the language with literary devices, such as alliteration, allusions, oxymorons, anagrams etc makes me absolutely enamored. \nI like to enjoy reading books that makes me breath air into my lungs and then smother me, my breath out of all those ideas in lines of elegance and cleverness within the sentences. \nSo I ask for books in those mentioned characteristics. I hope you can help me find my journey through books \"made\" specially for the 2% of the population, those with aphantasia.",

Domnhall Gleeson really made reserve and shy Jim likeable, unlike Tony whom I found brusque and forceful. I particularly hated the proposal and the motivation behind it.\n\nThis week, I finally read the book and these are my impressions but also some questions :\n\n1) I don't get Eilis sometimes. She tries to be a good person (including Dolores, miss MacAdam and Sheila in the conversation, etc.), but I feel like she also wants to be validated by the more popular girls. \n\n2) what was Mrs Kehoe's real motivation when she put Eilis in the best bedroom ? And were the other girls saying the truth about the stalker or did they say that out of jealousy ?\n\n3) What's wrong with miss Fortini ?\n\n4) Was father Flood saying the truth when he said he hasn't talked to Mrs Kehoe since Rose's death or was he lying? Did he know that Eilis and Tony had sex?\n\n5) Rose's death was as brutal and shocking as in the movie, if not more.\n\n6) Tony was likable and less forceful. We also learn more about Jim, that he actually liked pre-Brooklyn Eilis but he was too shy.\n\nAll in all, I still would have preferred for Jim and Eilis to be together.\n\nTL; DR : I was confused by book Eilis and how she judged and perceived Mrs Kehoe and father Flood, and some of her actions toward the others. I still like Jim and still would have preferred them together, though I don't know how she could have managed that.",

Is anyone interested in thinking about what it could look like to pick Parable as your community's One Read for next year, as a tie-in to the book's setting? \n\nWe have a few partners locally who might be interested in taking this on where we are, and it would be great to brainstorm with others. Additonal reasons for the choice: The book has a bunch of timely themes, has a Black female teen protogonist and a diverse range of characters to help draw in readers, and has both original and a graphic novel for extra ease of engagement.\n\nMaybe others are already thinking along these lines. In any case, would love to hear your thoughts or ideas around possible community activities!",

Are there other examples of children's books or series that went through revisions without much pushback?",

I came upon it in a Little Free Library in my neighborhood. \n\nWhile I could never know what a black person goes through, there were a few parts that were relatable to me (as a non-white bi-racial person), like how the main character feels out of place at her mostly-rich and white private school. \n\nReading about how Starr's life in her neighborhood and how ppl dont choose to be drug dealers bc they want to but out of necessity or desperation was really sad to read about. It creates this cycle, which I also read about in The New Jim Crow.\n\nI absolutely loved the relationship Starr w her mom and dad, especially her dad. I loved their banter. TBH i wish i had that sort of relationship w my parents (not that my relationship w my mom is bad whatsoever. we're very close) \n\nHave you read this ? what did you think of it ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS - this was an old library book that was taken out of rotation (judging by the stickers) and it was labelled \"YA.\" As a 36 year old, am i too old to read YAs ? lol i really enjoy them.I like coming of age movies  /tv shows as well",

        "text": "Back in college, I used some of my spare cash to buy some rarer copies (signed, limited edition, etc.). One of these books was a 25th anniversary edition of *Little, Big* by John Crowley. This would've been about 8-9 years ago that I placed the preorder.\n\nAt first, I checked in on it pretty routinely; seemed like there was always an update that release was just around the corner, etc., but ultimately I forgot about it after a while, though every time I moved (three apartments, two houses), I'd recall and email the publisher to update my address. Still, even then, I had pretty much given up on it, but it was past the point where I could request a refund on my account, so I figured I'd just keep updating the address.\n\nFast forward to last month.\n\nJanuary 21, the publisher on *Little, Big* said they were starting to ship out copies of the ~~25th~~ sorry, now it's the 40th anniversary edition, but you had to confirm your shipping address (which I did on the 23rd).\n\nIt has now been over a month with no update or tracking information.\n\nOn the website, there is this line:\n\n&gt;With a project whose order history spans 18 years\n\nThis is not something to be proud of. Whoever has been behind the editing and publishing of this edition has royally messed up. It took longer to get this developed and released than *Duke Nukem Forever*, which is notorious for the amount of time it took (it holds the world record for longest development time in a video game).\n\nExcept *Duke Nukem Forever* was built from scratch—*Little, Big* was released in 1981, so by 2004 when this project began, the full text had already been out for 23 years. It took them 18 more and they still seem to be making excuses for delays.\n\nI'm not even posting this in irritation or annoyance at this point—frankly, I'm amazed at how catastrophically incompetent the people behind this project are. I can't imagine anyone in the publishing industry is interested in hiring someone who can botch a job this badly.",

The works are still lovely, and I dont mean to disparage the efforts in translation, but I just can't help but wonder if it leaves something wanting.\n\nI had put \"the Count of Monte Cristo\" off for the express purpose of reading it in French. Then I remember about things like \"the phantom of the opera\" and &lt;&lt;Notre dame de Paris&gt;&gt; (hunchback) being translations from French as well.\n\n\nIfsomeonee has thoughts to share, or has experiences with translations from a language you speak; I'd love to start a conversation.\n\nEg: someone Slavic reading Dostoevsky, Japanese reading Murakami(, **Dumas read in French**), or the many other authors who have reached inter-linguistic stardom in the \"English cannon\"",

Only that it was printed in early 2000s. It talked about how women should act sexy in order to feel sexy. And there was a chapter about female pleasure that was written to be left lingering around the house hoping that your guy would read it. I am pretty sure the author was a woman. I could be wrong though! Help me out! Google is no help.",
