        "text": "This situation took place years ago at the house I rented with my then pre-schoolers.\nI was extremely fortunate to rent a a house where the rent was very reasonable &amp; I had an amazing landlord.\nThe owner of the house next door was an older, very cantankerous &amp; rude woman &amp; her totally obnoxious son (who also hit on me, that‚Äôs another story). They had an older, very sweet &amp; gentle dog I‚Äôll name Tim. Tim was frequently allowed to wander free (busy road no less) &amp; he was an almost daily visitor to our home because he loved us vice versa. I‚Äôd always walk him back to a own yard, because I was scared to death he‚Äôd be hit by a car.  Not that his neglectful, nasty owners ever appreciated this mind you!\nTim had Gastro issues &amp; had trouble controlling his bowels, poor old guy, which were very loose. Because he frequently visited us, he often would lose control &amp; leave a huge pile of doggy diarrhea smack dab on the walkway right in front of our front steps, which inevitably would lead to either me or my kids accidentally stepping in it on the way out, which caused a few incidents of either my kids being late to school or me being late getting off to work. \nTo be clear-I never got angry at the poor pup, it wasn‚Äôt his fault.\nEach &amp; every time I‚Äôd speak to the neighbors requesting that they please keep Tim on their property to prevent this from happening (they had a large fenced in yard no less, Tim got out because the gate was frequently left open)either the old lady would scream at me or the son would laugh &amp; make very rude remark‚Äôs.\nCue petty revenge, ha.\nThe next time I found yet another huge pile of dog poop in front of the steps, I didn‚Äôt bother saying anything to the neighbors, I merely picked it up w/a shovel, walked over to the neighbors house when they weren‚Äôt home &amp; proceeded to deposit the poop not just in the same spot there, but took it a step further &amp; dumped it right in front of their door. I did this 3x. \nI could hear the glorious screams of surprise &amp; disgust from both the old lady &amp; her son from my houseü§£ü§£.\nNow, before anyone says anything, I anticipated those AH‚Äôs possibly taking it out on poor Tim + already being concerned about the neglect, I had already contacted a friend who was the consulting vet for our local animal rescue/shelter, alerting them of the situation, they told me document &amp; take photos/videos. Which I  did.  \nAnyway, the neighbors finally realized it was me that was gifting them back the dog poop, the old lady showed up at my front door 1 day &amp; boy was she livid. I‚Äôd kept my video camera on the table in front of the open window closest to my front door pointing towards the front steps in anticipation of this happening so I could record it &amp; she didn‚Äôt disappoint! Screaming/cursing ensued on her part, while I calmly responded &amp; requested she leave the property or I‚Äôd call the police. She didn‚Äôt &amp; continued to insult/threaten me &amp; my kids. Let me add that while this was going on, Tim was loose. \nOk then. \nCalled the police AND my vet friend. Both showed up within about 30 minutes, I proceeded to show them what I‚Äôd just recorded, plus poor Tim was crying on the neighbors front steps to be let in (this broke my ‚ù§Ô∏è)&amp; the neighbors refused. Police &amp; vet friend decided Tim needed to be rescued , the PO went over to inform the neighbors while vet friend leashed Tim who‚Äôd came over to me in my front yard looking for comfort &amp; walked him over to the shelters van. The old lady didn‚Äôt know she was being recorded during her tantrum &amp; tried to accuse me of harassing her &amp; trying to steal her dog. She turned pure white &amp; was for once speechless when the PO informed her there was video evidence &amp; she could be charged for her threats against minor children + animal neglect. I agreed not to press charges in exchange for her willingly surrendering Tim &amp; never again even thinking of EVER saying another word to me or my kids &amp; staying off our property. \nShe agreed. \nTim was adopted by a wonderful older retired gentleman who got him the vet care he needed &amp; started him on a special diet. He went on to I live his best life!\nAs for the neighbors, turns out AH son had an arrest warrant out for him &amp; he just happened to be arrested when he showed up at the house while the PO was still there, giving them a rash of sh** about *harassment*. üôÑü§£\nThe old lady ended up selling her house 6 months later, because sonny boy was in jail &amp; she couldn‚Äôt afford to keep the house. I ended up buying our rental &amp; my new neighbors became very good friends. \nBTW-I didn‚Äôt have any fears about possible violent retribution from the neighbors son, his charges weren‚Äôt violent in nature &amp; he was a huge coward &amp; was aware I was a trained weaponry/physical defense expert &amp; he left the state after his prison stint. I later hear He died from alcoholism about 10 years later, he‚Äôd abandoned his mother who ended up in a state funded nursing home. \nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "This happened a couple years ago when I lived on the third floor of an apartment building. The stairs leading to the upper floors were outside, with balconies between apartments. It‚Äôs strictly forbidden to grill food on the balconies or under the stairs. Doing so is a hazard to the entire building, as it could result in a fire. It can also cause respiratory issues for occupants of apartments filled with smoke.\n\nMy first floor neighbors disregarded this rule and frequently grilled beneath the stairs. I had asked them several times not to because it was dangerous and filling my apartment with smoke. They never listened to me. As the months went by and my attempts to solve the issue failed, I began calling the fire department every time the neighbors grilled. The FD would respond and ticket my neighbors, but this never deterred them.\n\nEventually, I had enough. I know the FD was tired of responding to my calls, and I did feel bad that I was taking them away from more important issues. So, the day I moved out of my apartment I decided to have one last protest.\n\nThis time I didn‚Äôt ask the neighbors to stop (it wouldn‚Äôt have worked anyway) and I didn‚Äôt call the fire department. Instead, when they lit up their grill and smoke began billowing into the building, I took matters into my own hands. I waited from the third floor until I saw my neighbor momentarily walk away from the grill. This was my time to shine. I took a large bucket of water and poured it over the railing, landing directly over their open grill. The fire within the grill was immediately extinguished, the coals completely saturated. It took several minutes for my neighbor to return and realize what happened. He didn‚Äôt know it was me at first.\n\nI was quite pleased with myself. My fianc√© and I continued moving our things out of the apartment. He stopped us on one of our final trips down the stairs, complaining that somebody ruined his food. An uninvolved first floor neighbor, whom I hated from the start, began speculating that my fianc√© had done it. He was an old US Air Force veteran and my fianc√© was US Army, and that fueled his hatred. \n\nHe began yelling at my fianc√©, and I wasn‚Äôt going to have that. I admitted that I had dumped the water on the grill. He and the grilling neighbor asked me why I would do that instead of asking them to stop grilling. I explained that my previous attempts at verbally resolving the situation were futile, and I was sick of it. I pointed out that it was a violation of the city‚Äôs fire code and of our lease. I told him he was lucky I hadn‚Äôt reported him to the leasing office for his countless violations.\n\nI doubt this incident changed his grilling habits, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt live in that apartment anymore.",

        "text": "Another poster's story reminded me of this...\n\nI was a newly minted math teacher and was teaching college prep courses in high school (algebra, calculus, etc.) I had large classes (30+ students per class) and most students were motivated to get good grades. As a newish teacher I didn't have the skill (yet) to figure out *who* was cheating but there was a group of boys where I *knew* there was cheating happening.\n\nCue my petty plan...\n\nI created 3 versions of the next chapter test, A, B and C. On a quick glance they looked identical. The differences were using different numbers such as coefficients being different, or answers in a different order. When passing them out I did it row by row (take one, pass them back) so the rows were A, B, C, A, B, C...\n\nA very talkative kid (Joey) who was bright, cheerful, and an \"A\" student asked me to grade his test right after class ended, as he was excited to see his score. \"I studied hard for this test, I think I did great!\"\n\nI pulled out my answer sheet for test A, which was Joey's answer key, and was shocked as NONE of his responses were correct. Flustered, I checked his work, looked again for several answers to see if it was my key that was wrong... Nope. Joey's answers were all incorrect. I just muttered something like \"Sorry, I'll have to grade it later, I think I have the wrong key\" and sent him on his way.\n\nAfter reviewing that group's tests, and answers mostly matching key B, it was quite obvious who was the student providing answers (Mark) and who was copying (all the other) in  this group of 5 boys. \n\nBeing a math class, with grades solely a product of average test scores averaged over that semester, and a rule that cheating would result in a zero score, these five students got a pretty good lesson in math: how a zero score, averaged into several 80 to 90 percent scores, averaged out to MUCH less than an A. There are only 5 or 6 chapter tests per semester. (Of course, Mark was also given a zero because he was complicit in the scheme.)",

They did other things to try and copy, but I don't remember exactly what.\n\nWe were using scantron sheets so I lightly marked the right answer with one line while filling in a random wrong answer completely, but light enough that I could erase it. When I finished the test I pretended I was reading over the questions again and waited for the girls to turn theirs in. I had about 5 minutes to erase all the wrong bubbles and fill in the right ones.\n\nWhen we got the tests back, both girls failed. They asked what grade I got and showed them my A+ with a huge grin.

My professor (T) has immune issues and asked everyone to wear a mask during class, because if she caught COVID, it would hit her bad.\n\nNeedless to say, the students did not wear masks.\n\nShe got sick (not sure if it was COVID), but it was really bad. Lectures kept getting cancelled/moved online, soon she stopped giving homework, tests constantly kept getting moved around, it was a struggle all around. We never had a syllabus that entire semester. On top of that, we had a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) strike (put shortly, MOST of the grading is done by GSIs, and now they refused to work). This basically guaranteed that nothing would ever be graded on time in that class. Prof T tried her best to make up for the missed learning (offering an extreme of office hours, practice problems, and makeup tests), but it was basically impossible to reverse the damage done. \n\nOne student N decided the best way to deal with this was to constantly harass Prof T during zoom meetings. He would type random/obscene things in chat, ask completely unrelated questions, just do anything he could to disrupt class (more than the abnormal school year already was) and clog the Zoom chat. Prof T had to ask him to cut out his behavior multiple times as she regularly monitors Zoom chat for questions. I understood the resentment that students had (believe me, I was struggling in math too and I barely passed), but they seemed completely oblivious to the fact that Prof T was trying her hardest to accommodate for the very unfortunate school year circumstances. It was baffling how students attending a so-called top university in the world were incapable of basic human empathy.\n\nNext semester rolls around. Prof T has recovered, but not completely. Today our lecture gets cancelled again and moved to Zoom. It also gets postponed by around 15 minutes because of technical difficulties. Class is going smoothly, but we have to go over class time to make up for the extra 15 min lost. Prof T tells everyone that if they need to go to another class that they can leave, and the lecture will be recorded/uploaded later, and those who could stay were welcome to get in the extra learning now.\n\nN decides to cleverly remark something along the lines of \"Prof T, it's pretty cruel that students who have class right after this are forced to miss out on the extra learning, while students who can stay get an unfair advantage.\"  \nI remembered the jerk from last semester, so I decided to stick up for Prof T a bit because nobody would. I said: \"Wow, really? It's almost as if our class schedules determine what times we can and can't study. That's crazy. I never knew that!\"\n\nHe seemed taken aback by my sarcasm and shut up quick. Prof T couldn't stop laughing and told me to knock it off.\n\nHighlight of my day.",

Mean, vindictive and had an inferiority complex that she used to attack anyone who was doing well, especially those doing better than her. My dad spent my childhood over the road, and mom was in and out of inpatient facilities until she passed, so a lot of my time was spent with her being my only available carer/guardian.\n\n\n\nI won't bullshit and say I was perfect, but I wasn't bad. Good student, involved in community and school activities, and as soon as I could work, I got a job. My biggest issue was that I often took an attitude with her and her family, all of whom sucked to be near. These people have been in my life since I was 4, I am now in my late twenties and not one of them were ever supportive or kind.\n\n\n\nI had aspirations to go to school and be a psychologist, a teacher, a therapist, a veterinarian. Honestly, I think I just liked the structure school offered and wanted to continue with it after graduation, but as soon as I was handed my diploma, my stepmom handed me a notice to vacate the property. Less than a month later, I was gone.\n\n\n\nTo be fair to him, my father did try to intervene and prevent the eviction since it was his home, but she was the main occupant in the house and we were informed by a local cop that she could in fact remove me from the home and press trespassing charges if I ever came back. To this day, I think he was likely full of shit but didn't want to deal with it. So I was 18, homeless and supposed to start college a few months later, and I had chosen a local school and rejected better scholarships so I could stay home and save money on housing.\n\n\n\nI found a place with a man that became my best friend and I did try to attend school, but honestly it just didn't feel right anymore. Between full time work just to scrape by and the mental health issues that arose in the aftermath, I couldn't continue and dropped out. My dad was unable to offer much support, and most of my family never cared to intervene since she had convinced the majority of them that I had chosen basically to go NC with them. She would call and gloat about how hard the real world is, make snide comments about my (dying) mother, and in the same breath offer sympathy and support if I came back home. \n\n\n\nAt holiday dinners, she would tell everyone I was the first psychologist she'd ever seen working the til at McDonald's and if I defended myself, I would be chastised for not taking a joke. It was humiliating, and after a few years I realized I could block her and she couldn't do shit about it. So I did.\n\n\n\nMy life did turn around. I work as a pastry chef in a bakery I adore, and would love to buy some day if the owner would let me when he retires. It's not a life I ever imagined for myself, but it's a good one that I share with my fianc√© and I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\n\n\nIn the past two years, I resumed contact with my dad and as a result, his wife again. He's still a doormat and she's still a cunt, but she's not picking on a little girl anymore, and I bite back now. I've also managed to contact my mom's family, who had been estranged from her for decades before she died, and met people who could have truly loved me if they had known I existed. Dad's family are kept at arm's length, but I finally have a family that I can talk about when my friends are discussing holiday plans and that's all I ever wanted.\n\n\n\nDoing what I do for a living, I always show off a bit at family gatherings, and I've often made custom cakes for relatives when asked. Boundaries have been established, and after the first cousin who tried pushing them found herself without a cake on her son's birthday, they are respected.\n\n\n\nStepmom hates my job. She hates that I'm happy, that I don't care if I'm a bit plump, that I'm engaged and she's not allowed near the wedding. She hates that I'm *good* at what I do, and try as she might, the only thing she can ever insult is the fondant. Which, fair. I don't care for it either.\n\n\n\nAt my dad's birthday party last month, I baked a lovely three tier red velvet cake for him and provided numerous pastries as well as a cookie buffet. My boss is a godsend for letting me use his industrial kitchen to make it all. Day of, all stepmom could say was my cake tasted like a box mix, and that was it. Two decades of abuse and I was finally done trying. I spent days making everything I provided, all free of charge, and she compared my labor and knowledge to fucking Betty Crocker. \n\n\nNo shame to anyone who bakes/likes Betty or any other boxed mix, but it's like comparing fast food to your own home cooking and the fast food being preferred. A total slap in the face to the hours of labor and effort, and years spent honing and perfecting recipes.\n\n\n\n\nShe asked me at the beginning of February to bake her cake for her fiftieth, no other details other than she didn't want red velvet, and it was for 100 people. I agreed. I stocked up on Duncan Hines and canned frosting, slapped the frosting on top of shitty sheet cakes a day before and didn't bother decorating any of them. \n\n\n\nStepmom was LIVID. I ruined her birthday, embarrassed her in front of her friends and family, how could I be so callous, etc. I just told her she compared my cake at dad's party to Betty Crocker, so she must prefer low effort cakes. I left shortly after she started crying. Apparently she had planned on instagramming the party, and had planned on my normal quality of care for my desserts.\n\n\n\nDad didn't care, he just said it was best if I'm not around her for a bit and we meet up somewhere other than his house. I don't want to be near her again, and I hope her family choked on that dry ass cake.",

        "text": "  \n\nPlayers: \n\nOP, Writer and external relations\n\nBoss Troy, Director\n\nBoss Joey, Assistant director\n\nLola, THE photographer and social media\n\n(LONG) About a year ago, my coworker, Lola, was overwhelmed by a project that had taken her about a year to get nowhere on. She resisted all help on the project, insisting she could do it better than anyone else. I had done an identical project as Lola several times in the past, but she wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else touch it. Having experience in such a project was a factor in my getting hired, because Lola and no one else on staff had this experience. Including the bosses. Yet, because she found the process so overwhelming and the bosses wouldn‚Äôt insist on making her work as part of a team, I was asked to absorb some of her photography assignments within the media office for which we work.\n\nI am the staff writer, but have some 30 years of experience in all areas of our office, to include writing, reporting, photography, social media, video, media relations, community relations and event management. I have worked hard over the years to understand the full scope of our field so I can pitch in in a pinch. Lola is a photographer and graphic designer. A very good one, but that is all she‚Äôs ever been willing to learn. She uses Canva primarily for graphic design, because it‚Äôs easy. She‚Äôs told me as much. Anyone can use Canva. That‚Äôs why Canva exists.\n\nNine months past deadline, I‚Äôm asked to help Lola by helping with her workload. She would get full days to focus just on the project, which was nine months overdue. I would do both our jobs on those days, as well as half the photo assignments day-to-day. I likewise ended up doing a vast majority of any work that occurred in the evenings, because I‚Äôm a team player and she has kids. I remember the challenge of being a working mother with children and tried to be empathetic of her situation, as my own children are grown and out of the house. (She has a large, local, extended family.)\n\nFast forward to recent days. The big project was completed a few months ago, at least 15 months late. The work tempo never shifted, though. I was able to keep up with the workload and didn‚Äôt even think about the fact that I was still doing work that I had voluntarily offered to take on at least a year earlier to be a team player. Work that never shifted back to Lola. I honestly had forgotten all about it, as I don‚Äôt mind the nature of the work, and it got me out of the office quite a bit. I also didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed.\n\nOne Monday, I had done a photo assignment and took some pictures that were well-composed, but were not the quality of what Lola the photographer would have produced. I have a camera, while Lola has a multitude of lenses, cameras and lights to work with. So, of course what she‚Äôs going to create will look better than anything I can accomplish with the basic stuff I was given as a writer‚Ä¶who can help out in a pinch. These photos were particularly valuable, as whole families had come out to the experience, which we were not anticipating. So, there were some special photos in there that meant a lot to people other than myself as well.\n\nLola sees the photos and communicates that ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù she‚Äôs going to use photos she took herself a full year prior. Ones that are out of date and don‚Äôt include all participants. Don‚Äôt include the families in any way.\n\nI very politely explained the above significance and asked her to please use what I had produced, as many people were involved and acted in a timely manner to accomplish the task. I asked her to please be a good steward of all of our time and effort by using what I had produced. All were useable and more than adequate for social media, which was the intent. She asked if I minded, and I very politely and professionally told her I did. The bosses began to get CCed following this.\n\nLola could have handled it a lot of ways. Even if she still didn‚Äôt use my photos, she could have remained professional. Instead, she replied to my email with a list of about half a dozen things she felt were wrong with the photos and said that they were just SOME of the reasons she wouldn‚Äôt be using my work. Not acknowledging my message would have been politer, and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have chased her down to do my will. I support her in her work, but she did ask my opinion in this case and then talked to me like garbage. And Boss Troy and Boss Joey saw it all and said nothing. The photos were good, but she made them sound like a monkey had taken them with its feet.\n\nSo, I drafted two emails. One to Lola to let her know that I would be deferring all future photo assignments to her so she could be confident in the work that was produced. If she had a calendar conflict, I would be happy to help out, but otherwise I was going to defer them to her in the future. The bosses were CCed. Then I emailed Boss Troy and Boss Joey and told them much the same thing as Leslie, being sure to be respectful and professional the entire time. I told them her actions don‚Äôt contribute to a healthy workplace. Still, no acknowledgement. \n\nI am intentionally putting all of this in writing to protect myself, get it on the record and validate the professionalism I maintained. I work hard to never give anyone ammunition to use against me. I worked many years for the military and had to navigate those channels very carefully as a woman in the land of male warfighters.\n\nI‚Äôm just coming out of a pretty severe depression, so this whole thing threw me for a loop. I was deeply wounded that my coworker would treat me in such a way and that neither of our bosses addressed it. I ended up taking the next day off, and no one checked on me. That‚Äôs not to get pity, mind you, but no one in anyway acknowledged what happened. I deserved more respect as a simple human walking the earth. No one deserves to be treated that way.\n\nI sat there midday that Tuesday, and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sad‚Äù just popped into my head. I thought that was an interesting thing to consider and then realized that my anger was rooted in the fact that Lola was just plain unkind to me. She wasn‚Äôt just unprofessional, she was intentionally mean. THEN I remembered I had been voluntarily helping her with her work. I had gotten so used to the work tempo that I‚Äôd just plain forgotten the photo assignments were never intended to be split tasks.\n\nI came back to work Wednesday, and still no one addressed it. I did notice how my coworkers kept looking at me like they were waiting for me to say something, so Lola had been talking to them in my absence. It wasn‚Äôt me being paranoid, it was blatantly obvious. I chose not to be passive aggressive to Lola, but I also didn‚Äôt go out of my way to interact with her. I have treated my other coworkers as I would any other time, with kindness and a helpful heart.\n\nFriday rolled around, and still the bosses and Lola ignored the situation. No apologies, no comments about me deferring assignments. Nothing. I decided if they were not going to advocate for me and deal with the situation, then I would handle it. I have continually been asked to be the bigger person when Lola has been less than professional, and this was probably her fifth strike at this point. This miss was just freaking huge on her part.\n\nI head down to Boss Joey‚Äôs office, who makes the assignments. I ask if I could close the door and talk with him. I told him I knew there had been drama and that I didn‚Äôt want to go into the weekend with anything unsaid or on my mind. I told him I had no desire to sit down and talk with Lola and reminded him of her former work tempo. It was clear he had forgotten. I reminded him that I could do virtually every job on the staff, which he affirmed. I then likewise stressed that Lola had no ability to work outside of her lane, even if she wanted to. She doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to help me in my own work in any manner. He agreed that was also the case.\n\nI explained that it‚Äôs unfair to ask me to do 140% to Lola‚Äôs 60%. I told him it was wrong to have me do more just because I can. I likewise remined him how many photo assignments were at night, most of which I‚Äôd been doing. So, Lola was likewise going to have to start planning to adjust her work schedule, when needed. \n\nI asked him to please be sure to let Boss Troy know, so that we all knew what to anticipate as we moved forward. I likewise asked him to remind Boss Troy and Lola that I was simply giving back work that had been hers all along. I told him that I would not under any circumstances put myself in a position to be treated in that manner by a coworker in the future. I asked if he had any questions, he had none, so I thanked him for his time and went back to work.\n\nI‚Äôve been asked to do one photo assignment by Boss Joey since then, but Lola had a direct calendar conflict. I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs realized the genuine change that‚Äôs occurred yet, as we‚Äôre in week one, and thinks it‚Äôs all just gone away. I mean, if they didn‚Äôt talk to me, they sure as heck didn‚Äôt talk with her.\n\nSo, now I work hard and wait. Wait for Lola to ask me to take on something when she doesn‚Äôt have a direct calendar conflict. At that time, I‚Äôll remind her she‚Äôs the photographer and she can have the most confidence in her work if she does it herself, professionally of course!",

        "text": "We had to do our final project in pairs. We could chose our own partner and I immediately decided to choose my best friend, as we always did these kinds of projects together. But, one of my other friend (not a friend anymore) asked to be my partner and advised my best friend to pair with this other girl who was pretty close with my best friend. I thought it would help out everyone so I went ahead with it. My best didn't liked the plan and got upset with me. She didn't say anything at first but it eventually resulted in our fight and we stopped talking for a while.\n\nNow, back to the project... This girl said she doesn't have time to research and she isn't very good with it so she asked me to do all of the research and that she will make the final project, which we will present together in class. I was stupid so I agreed without questioning. Then, I spent 2 weeks doing all the work and gave everything to her to just copy and finalize. She wrote 5 pages in 3 days and said that it is enough and we should ask the professor to prepone our presentation because she have to go on a vacation with her boyfriend, and they have already booked the tickets for the next day. I got angry at her but tried to calmly convince her to write everything before the presentation and that we should do it when she come back. But she wanted to be done with the presentation before her vacation so she can enjoy herself. She went behind my back and asked the professor and then told me that we are presenting. I was beyond angry at that point. But, I didn't want to make the bad impression on the professor so I went ahead with it. Our presentation was horrible to say the least. I was one of the top students in class and was in the good books of the teachers, so my professor was really disappointed and asked to me do it again. My partner said she won't do it. I told that I'll do it and that she can go on her vacation. She got happy, thanked me, left the next day.\n\nI was already planning my revenge just hoping it would work.\n\nI already researched everything, I just had to write everything. I put in my best efforts, made all the charts, diagrams, graphs and everything to make it better. And I brought my academic writing classes into use and wrote my name on the top write corner of every single of those 20 pages. I was really proud of that project, just to go by the rules I put the sheets she wrote at the end and wrote her name on it. Then, I presented it in class and got an A, and best part was that the professor graded it individually so she got a D. The look on her face was priceless when she came back and saw her score.\n\nShe thought she could take advantage of me. When I got over the initial anger, I realised all of the times she talked to me was only when she needed help with our school work. I am happy to be done with her, now I don't think back and resent myself for being nice to her, because I got my revenge at the end.\n\nI talked it out with my best friend and we are going strong.",

        "text": "This takes place close to twenty years ago but still makes me chuckle. My freshmen year of college, I lived in dorms with landline room phones that went in sequential order. This knowledge is what I used to exact my petty revenge. \nI was up late studying for spring finals. I didn‚Äôt expect total silence but these neighbors were usually kinda loud/inconsiderate on a goo day. It was tolerable until it wasn‚Äôt. My desk and bed were against my neighbor‚Äôs wall. Obviously done with finals or at least studying, my neighbors had a party. I had ignored the loud music, laughing/yelling and slamming doors from them until about 11pm. I had already tried earplugs, headphones with my own music, etc. but they were getting rowdy. \nAs it was so late, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable going across the university campus to the library. I finally got fed up and went over to ask if they could keep it down a little as it was so late. The neighbors  just stood there and while their friends snickered. I stared at them until I got some acknowledgment but no apology. I went back to my room and tried to get back to work. Of course, they continued to be inconsiderate assholes. I could even hear them making fun of me as they got louder.\nI decided I wouldn‚Äôt get any more studying done, but I wasn‚Äôt going to get the RA involved as it was now midnight. It wasn‚Äôt an emergency, just rude as hell. I put earplugs in and eventually fell asleep, planning my sweet revenge for 5am the next morning.\nNext morning, I got out of bed quietly and sat down at my desk, my left ear pressed against the wall. Of course, dead silence now. \nI was able to countdown from my phone number to figure out their landline number. I used my Tracfone cell phone and started calling them. It rang as off-campus so I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd suspect me. Back then, cell phones weren‚Äôt terribly common and who would waste those prepaid, precious minutes?\nI would hear one of them get out of bed and stumble over to the phone only to hang up as soon as they answered. I did this several times, waiting to call again until I heard them get back in bed. The last time they answered, the one girl whined ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù Best minutes I ever spent!",

        "text": "So I recently sold my iPad Pro 12.9\" for a Mini for more portability, and the magic keyboard that I had as an accessory that was only compatible with the 12.9\" iPad obviously was obsolete. After listing this KB on my local 2nd hand site for the average going price of $200USD equivalent, a bloke sent me a message slashing the price to \\~$180 like he's bestowing me the chance to sell him stuff, which, for a very decently conditioned Magic KB is not a very good price point to sell at. ( In my region the government charges a 13-17% tax for Apple products, thus 2nd hand local going prices may seem higher for USA viewers.) At first glance I was unwilling to compromise for $180, so I rejected his offer by standing firm at $200. This is where things got interesting, as he proceeded to call me a 'profiteer' that 'sells at outrageous prices' and 'has no idea of current going prices' whilst being completely oblivious to the KB's better-than-average condition. Being annoyed by the guy's choice of words, I however had an idea of petty revenge and malicious compliance concocting inside my head. So I replied, 'Fine. $180 it is, shipping costs not included or get your KB elsewhere.' - to which he agreed and made the payment. So in my region the delivery service conveniently accepts freight to collect as an option, i.e. the consignee, that rude lowball bloke, has to pay the shipping cost on retrieving the package, which gives me, the consigner, the chance to select a boatload of upselling options to inflate shipping costs. Unfortunately he only lives 15km away from where I am so it kind of sucks that I couldn't go all out on jacking up the cost. (e.g. Air mail instead of land transport and all that). I went and chose 'expert packaging with box and bubble wrap' that logistics charges for $4, item insurance ($200\\*0.8%) which adds $1.6. On-time delivery insurance-  $2. Receipt collecting service- $2. Rush shipping, $8. Base shipping fee on top of all this, $5. Adding these services up we land on $22.6. For comparison, standard delivery would only cost $2 for this 1kg package, roughly upcharging him by 1100%. Should he be living 150km away I'm sure I can make $50+ fees possible. Refusing to retrieve the package wouldn't be a viable option for him, since I, as the seller, am eligible to deduct the shipping fees from his prepaid amount due to his refusal.  Later I got a notification that the package has been successfully delivered to the recipient. Scarcely did I close out of the logistics app did I receive a dozen angry messages coming from that dude absolutely fuming about being $22 poorer. Yeah had you chosen to not be such an asshole and negotiated prices like a DECENT HUMAN BEING BY ASKING NICELY I would've gave you the deal. I muted his messages and now all I have to do is wait for 7 days and the payment would be automatically transferred to my account. Sucks to be him I guess.",

        "text": "Way back in the day, circa 1986, my brother and I lived with our Mom, her new husband, and my stepbrother, out in the country. Where we lived, there was five things to do for fun: Hunting, fishing, football, swimming, and riding ATVs. If you didn't like doing any of those, well, you were SOL. \n\nFor my birthday that year, my Dad had given me a little German Shepard/St. Bernard mixed puppy. I named her Fluffy, because she was a little ball of fluff. What do you want, I was 10 years old. Fast-forward 6 months, and Fluffy was not quite so fluffy anymore...nor was she small. She was a fierce protector of my brother and I, and much beloved by us and our friends. \n\nOur next-door neighbors had two boys: one my age, and one a few years younger. They also had a GIANT 4-wheeler, one of those big ones that you use for hunting in the back woods. Their younger son was a spoiled little asshole, could do no wrong in his mother's eyes, and the rest of us kids absolutely HATED him. His brother regularly got in trouble for not letting him tag along with us when we were playing. His parents would also let him ride the 4-wheeler around the \"neighborhood\"...really, a couple of dirt roads that crossed each other. In any case, he was MUCH too young to be riding around on his own.\n\nOne fine day, we were all outside playing, and the little asshole was riding around on the ATV. He was crossing back and forth through the yard in between our houses, and after a few back-and-forth passes, he saw Fluffy, who was laying in the sun. He made a beeline for her with the ATV, narrowly missing running her over when she got up and dodged. Of course, all of us older kids started yelling at him. Of course, his mother, who was outside as well, yelled at us for yelling at her baby, spouting stuff like \"he's just playing, he didn't mean any harm, he wasn't *really* going to run her over\", etc. In the middle of the yelling match, he tried to run over her again. At this point, I had had beyond enough, so I took up my sword and advanced to do battle. \n\nYes, I said \"sword\". Don't get all upset, it was a plastic toy sword. At most it would have bruised him a little. I know, as I speak from experience. Anyway, he rode away, laughing at us, taunting that he was gonna \"get my stupid dog\". Unfortunately for him, he was NOT watching where he was going.   \n\nYou ever see someone take a mailbox to the face? Well, if you haven't, my friends, I'm here to tell you that it was GLORIOUS! The mailbox, like most out in the country, was on a wooden post, and stuck out in front. While riding he ATV, he was at the *perfect* height for the ATV to pass underneath the mailbox unimpeded. \n\nThe ATV. \n\n*Not* him. \n\n*He* was at the perfect height to catch a face-full of mailbox, having turned to look where he was going when his Mom screamed at him to, well, \"*look out where you're going!*\"\n\nIt also didn't help him that, in his effort to run away from us, he had that ATV running pretty much flat out. Ever watch Wyle E Coyote hit the tunnel while riding a rocket, and the rocket keeps on going through the tunnel while Wyle E Coyote stops in midair and falls? It was like that, but with more of a metallic *twwwoooommmmp* sound. \n\nLittle asshole hits the mailbox, then hits the dirt. Of course, he starts crying like his very soul got knocked out of him. Of course, we are all *dying* laughing. Of course, his mother is *beyond* pissed.\n\nAt us. \n\nFor laughing at her baby's misfortune. \n\nShe was yelling at us, running over to her baby, while I yelled back at her that he got what he deserved for trying to run over my dog. She came over to the house later on, after my Mom had gotten home from work, to complain to her. Having already heard the story from me, my brother, and my stepbrother, my Mom told her off about her kid being a spoiled little shit who got what he deserved for trying to run over my dog, and if he tried it again she was going to call CPS. \n\nTo this day, whenever I'm having a bad day, the memory of him hitting that mailbox and landing flat on his back never fails to bring a smile to my face.",

She was separated from her husband, waiting for the divorce to be final. She had two young children and her STBX (Kevin) would come weekly to \"visit\" the children. \n\nThis was code for eating her food, washing his clothes, sleeping on the couch, and yelling at the kids for bothering him.  She kept humoring him and letting him do this because she was waiting for the papers to be finalized, and did not want him to delay things by being an ass. \n\nThey were set to sign the papers in less than two weeks, and he came to visit again. The kids were down for their naps and she was cleaning in the back of the house. She came back out to find that Kevin had eaten the food she had set out for them to have for dinner. He made a big mess in the kitchen and was now asleep on her couch. \n\nShe was pissed but knew that confronting him directly would not accomplish anything other than possibly delay her divorce. So she took a deep breath and started to straighten up the kitchen, She was putting things back in the refrigerator when she saw a package of stew beef. She had forgotten about it and it had it was no longer safe to eat. \n\nShe finished cleaning up and went outside to get some fresh air when she got a good look at Kevin's car. He had been in some sort of accident and the metal above the wheel well was torn open. That was the lightbulb moment. \n\nShe went inside and got the trash to throw it away. She went back outside and set the bag on the ground next to the trash can and took out the package of stew beef. Then she grabbed a pair of garden gloves and carefully put all the rotting meat inside the hole above the wheel well. \n\nThen she sat back and waited. Oh, I should probably mention that it was the end of July when she did this. When Kevin came back to visit the kids you could smell the rotting meat from 25 ft away from the car. While the kids were taking their naps, she sat and looked out the window while drinking a glass of wine. Her view was of Kevin in the driveway tearing his car apart trying to find the source of the smell. \n\nWhen he came back a few days later, she insisted that he park down the street from the house due to the smell. He told her that he did not know what it was and that he had to stop on the side of the road multiple times to throw up due to the smell. It took another week before he found the source of the smell. Kevin told her that a small animal must have crawled in there and died. \n\nTo this day, he still has no idea that she did it",

        "text": "I lived in a duplex once, and I never had any issues at all there until this new couple moves in next door- Apparently he was on probation for meth-related charges, he was a total narcissistic dick whose mom still treated him like he did no wrong, he tried to act like he was a hardened thug although he grew up in a predominantly white town in the suburbs (this couple lovingly refered to one another as \"n*gga\" instead of \"sweetie\" or \"honey\"). He was always yelling at someone.  I felt bad for the girlfriend often.\nThe trouble started shortly after they moved in, when they started having these long, yelling and SCREAMING fights in the middle of the night. He was obviously getting physical. She yelled for someone to call the police and I did the first time but when the got there she said they were just playing around-and then the fight continued-I mentioned it to the landlord who must have said something to them, which pissed the guy off (he said I was a narc lol) so they started going out of their way to be obnoxious. Like banging on walls, lying to the landlord (saying I placed cat feces on their porch? Not my style), blaring music, typical petty bs that I tried to ignore until....\nOne day I was walking out of my door with my dog while they were walking into theirs with their kid, and it startled both my dog and I when we walked out and my dog instinctively barked, once, I told her no and she stopped, and we continue down the steps into our yard. We were not speaking at this point or I would have said \"sorry\", because the bark must've  startled their daughter who I heard start crying as we were walking away. The next thing I know this HUGE rock/brick comes whizzing by us, and I turn around and see the guy ducking back in the house. I am PISSED, although at this point I have figured out that my landlord is not going to do anything, because it turns out my neighbor's dad is an old friend of his. So, a plan comes to me. Yardwork was our responsibility-we each did our own halves of the yard. I didn't have a mower so I paid someone I knew to help with my yard work, while my neighbor boasted that I was an idiot for paying someone to do it, he would never pay someone (because his mommy had bought him a brand new push mower). \nFor a week, I carried a backpack with me while I walked my dog, and collected every single huge rock I could find (the size of my open hand or bigger), and late at night when they'd gone to bed I'd place them in different areas of the yard.  There were dozens and dozens of rocks, so many....and I waited for the weekend. I was mostly concerned that the rocks would be visible. When I heard the mower crank, it was like Christmas morning. He hit the first rock, the mower cut off and he started swearing, I was inside laughing so hard. This happened several more times until I guess the mower wouldn't turn on again, I'm not sure exactly, but mowing was over for the day (I saw him leave with it later in the week in the back of his car and return with it a few days later). Then-the same process starts all over again-except this time, after he hits the second huge rock, he finally realized that something was up and I saw him spend the next hour and a half collecting them all (I was impressed with myself when I saw the pile he made of them). He said something to the landlord about it and I laughed and said \"That is just ridiculous. You should ask him what reason I would have for throwing rocks\". I never heard anything else about it after that.\nI ended up having to move after the neighbors got a new Bassett hound puppy-the first day they left it home alone it cried all day and made a mess in their house. My daughter and I were in the front yard, and he put the dog on the front porch, kicked it, picked it up, and literally threw the dog off the porch. I told my daughter to take our dog in and to call 911. Meanwhile the guy had gotten a BB gun and started shooting the dog who was crying so loud. He ran back in the house and I ran and grabbed the dog and wouldn't let him go. The neighbor then started trying to take the dog from me saying things like \"Your on MY property b*tch\" and he elbowed me in the face giving me a black eye. He went to jail that day (and the dog got a new family the next day)...thankfully now I live in such a nice place with such nice neighbors.",

        "text": "\nThis isn‚Äôt my petty revenge story, but my grandpa‚Äôs. About 15 or more years ago my grandparents retired and moved to a gated community a couple of blocks from a decent sized lake. Their house was near Lake Athens, Texas. My grandpa absolutely loves to get out of the house and fish, so retiring close to a lake was an absolute godsend for him. I remember going out on the lake and fishing with him multiple times growing up. He had a Tracker boat that he would tow with his old 80ish Chevy truck.\n\nNow just so you know, this wasn‚Äôt his daily driver. He used it strictly for towing his boat. When not in use, he would park it in a little alcove a few feet away from his driveway, surrounded by trees. Appearance wise, this truck was not beautiful and had definitely seen better days, but it was still more than capable of taking his boat to and from the lake with no problems at all. Fast forward a few months and he receives a letter from his next door neighbor. It turns out, they hate seeing his old truck (despite it being pretty well covered by trees), and believe it ruins their enjoyment of looking outside their house. In the letter, they have stated that they have contacted the HOA multiple times with the goal of either fining him until he sells his truck, or removes it completely from their view. My grandpa was pissed! He called his HOA to discuss the letter and it turns out, the HOA has shut down all of the neighbors complaints, but they are persistent and keep sending more. Now here comes the revenge.\n\nMy grandpa then asks if there would be any repercussions from chopping down a few trees on his property (the trees that oh so kept his Chevy moderately hidden from his pesky neighbors‚Äô peeping eyes). He gets the all clear, and begins chopping away. His old, beat up Chevy that was once covered ever so carefully by the trees, was now displayed bare in its entirety for the whole world to see. Needless to say, the grinches next door were not happy to see his truck uncensored. From what I remember, they tried to complain again before deciding to move away. You must have a pretty pathetic life if the sight of someone‚Äôs old truck is enough to make you pack up and leave.",

        "text": "Much back story is required, I mean, I could leave you with a quick little story, but that's no fun, is it? So this one's a little long, sorry.  TL/DR at the end\n\nI was a cook at a bar/restaurant in Ballard, Washington(suburb of Seattle). It was part-time, since I also worked in another kitchen. \n\nI had worked for this company for a while since I used to manage the kitchen of one of their other restaurants before they closed it down and brought me onto working here.  It was a pay-cut and fewer hours.\n\nIt was a Sunday night with the following Monday being a holiday, so many people didn't have work. I was going to be alone in the kitchen since the other cook had called out earlier that day.  I had plans with my girlfriend later that night, so me being more or less forced to work later kinda screwed that up. (I don't remember exactly what it was, since this was almost 10 years ago, but that I'd already paid for it).\n\nThey ended up getting the owners friends son or something like that(don't entirely remember TBH) to come work and to support me and then close, so I didn't have to stay as late. He'd never really worked in kitchens before, so he wasn't really the biggest help, but two extra hands are better than none, I guess..\n\nIt was much busier that night than anyone had really anticipated. So needless to say, we got slammed in the kitchen.. the night carried on, and it was after when I should've been done when it finally started to slow down.  The menu had switched from the full menu to a bar menu at that point, so there were only a few things on it.  \n\nBeing fed up with this company and everything that had happened over the last 6 months, I gave a quick rundown to the other guy and left for my weekend and to the thing with my girlfriend(since I didn't work again until Wednesday).\n\nI guess it ended up getting extremely busy after I left, and they had to call the kitchen manager to come help the other guy out...\n\nI never heard anything about any of this until  2 hours before my shift on Wednesday.  I was getting ready to leave my other job at the restaurant I actually liked working at(you know the one that actually values you and your time...) to head back to the original bar.  \n\nI got a phone call from the kitchen manager, who told me that he had to go in to help the other guy out and that I shouldn't have left and should've stayed with him to close and miss out on the things I had already planned and blah blah blah.. you know, that whole thing. So, at that point, he fired me over the phone..\n\nMy boss at the better restaurant overheard most of that phone conversation since he was standing by me while it happened.. without any hesitation, right after the call ended,  offered me the sous chef position(which came with a raise and full time, instead of part-time).. needless to say, I accepted and out worked out in my favor for all of that..\n\n\nAnd cue the pretty revenge part of the story..\n\nAbout a week after this all happened, I decided I should go explain myself to the owner and enlighten him on to some things that he probably didn't know about going on in his restaurant. I came in and sat down with him, and at this point I told him his kitchen manager and other kitchen workers were regularly drinking on the clock in the kitchen, performing unsanitary food procedures, and committing time theft, by manipulating hours worked into their favor. \n\nI never heard what happened from that. I also don't really care that much. But damn, did it feel good! \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nTL/DR got fired over the phone from the kitchen manager.  Talked with the owner about the kitchen manager and other kitchen employees drinking on the job, unsanitary food procedures, and time theft that they all did",

        "text": "Some background. My ex and I had dated off and on for 2 years and then she became pregnant. We were living with her parents and 4 months after our daughter was born, She disappeared apparently leaving me for a new boyfriend. There was a little bit of contact after that for a while and then she seriously disappeared and her family said they had no idea where she was at. Almost two years went by and then the state contacts me and for child support. Flash forward to when our daughter is about 15 and I'm paying $125 bucks a week in support. My ex has done everything in her power to prevent any real relationship with my daughter so I'm not really involved in her life.  Then one day My ex calls up complaining on and on about our daughter's behavior and how tough everything is. Finally I said \"hey, You know this is not my problem. You got exactly what you wanted and kept me out of her life. So deal with it yourself\". She started screeching about how I couldn't talk to her like that and I told her that I didn't want to hear her shit anymore. She said I would be sorry. About a month or two goes by and I get a notice that she's requested an income review to raise child support. I called the friend of the court and spoke with an agent who crazily enough was the same agent I had spoken with when support was originally set 13 years prior. I told her it had not been 3 years since the last review and was curious as to why she was getting it. The agent got some ruffled feathers and asked if I thought she didn't have the authority to do so. I said you most certainly do have the authority to do so, but you had no interest in doing the review until she requested it. The conversation wound down and then about a week later I received a copy of a letter sent to my ex asking for her to please fill out what change of circumstance was she basing her request for an increase on. About a month after that I got another letter that stated that since my ex did not respond she was not only not getting her income review now she was also not getting her income review that was due at the end of the 3 years in a few months. By the time the next review would come up my daughter would already be over 18 and child support would be at an end. So essentially that meant my support was set until it was over. What they did not know was that my income had drastically increased since the last review and she probably would have gotten about $150 to $200 a week in additional support for over 3 years. So possibly over $30K. So she tried to get petty but I was the one that got revenge.",

He wanted to do a ‚Äúswap‚Äù, meaning if we had one he didn‚Äôt have and vice versa, we would trade usernames and passwords. Well we had Peacock Premium and he had Apple TV+, so we swapped.

However, yesterday, I had no choice but to go around 8 PM.\n\nTo my surprise, the gym was almost empty, maybe because it was Friday. Anyways, I took advantage of the empty gym to do five sets of sled pushes. I don‚Äôt like doing them when the gym is crowded because people walk through the track all the time and that annoys me.\n\nI started doing my 40-meter sled pushes, and after every round, I‚Äôd put my water bottle on top of the weights while I sat on the floor next to it to rest. The water bottle being there and me being maybe 2-3 feet away is enough to let other people know that the sled is currently in use. However, even if you‚Äôre not sure, seeing the bottle should at least prompt you to look around and see who it belongs to.\n\nI was sitting on the floor resting before my last set when a woman walked to the sled and kicked my water bottle. I took my headphones off, and the conversation went like this:\n\nMe: \"Hi, excuse me! That‚Äôs my water bottle, I‚Äôm using the sled at the moment!\" (As friendly as I could be)\n\nHer: \"You‚Äôre not using it, are you? You‚Äôre sitting on the floor.\"\n\nMe: \"I‚Äôm in between sets, which is why my bottle is there so people know it‚Äôs in use.\"\n\nHer: \"Well, you can‚Äôt use a water bottle to reserve a machine that you‚Äôre clearly not using.\"\n\nAt this point, I got up and stood between her and the sled.\n\nMe: \"As I said, I was resting between sets. I‚Äôve not finished my sets yet. But by all means, feel free to wait until I‚Äôm finished.\"\n\nI then started pushing the sled one way and then back. When I got to the start position again, she started walking towards the sled, thinking I was going to walk away. Oh, baby no. Here is where the MC started.\n\nI sat on the sled weights while resting because, as she said, I couldn‚Äôt use my water bottle to show people it was in use, so I was just going to use my body. She got really angry and said:\n\nHer: \"What are you doing?\"\n\nMe: \"Resting between sets. I know now I can‚Äôt reserve the machine with a water bottle, so I‚Äôm just going to sit here while I rest.\"\n\nHer: \"This is unbelievable. How many sets do you have left?\"\n\nMe: \"I don‚Äôt know, a few more.\"\n\nI put my headphones back in and started another set. She was still waiting. So I did another set. She was still there. I did another.\n\nAt this point, my legs felt like jelly, and I could barely finish my sets, but she was still waiting for the sled. It had been like 15 minutes, and I forced myself to keep going out of spite. She looked so angry and was trying to talk to me, but I had my headphones in and blasting music, ignoring her.\n\nI ended up doing 12 extra sets until she walked away. I started unloading my weights from the sled when a group of three gym bros asked if I was done. I said yes and that it was all theirs.\n\nAs I walked away towards the changing room, she saw me and walked towards the sled track just to find the three gym bros loading it. I could see the disappointment in her face when she saw them.\n\nThe best part is that if she had been a decent human being, I would‚Äôve been done in a minute and she could‚Äôve had the sled all to herself, because I only had one set left originally.",

First thing I saw was one of my flatmates hoovering the hallway, and she‚Äôd cleaned the bathrooms as well!\nI think someone had bought hand soap and toilet roll. \nI asked if she wanted a hand with anything else so I said I‚Äôd help her with the kitchen. \nAs we are cleaning, another one of my flatmates comes in. She sees us cleaning and just sits on the couch. She asks me where the cleaning cloths had went, I just shrug and say I don‚Äôt know.\n\nI ask her to give us a hand. She says, ‚Äúoh I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to start! Seems you both have it under control anyway.‚Äù \nI tell her she could clean the shower and help us take the bins out. She did help us with the bins that night, but with the shower she said she‚Äôd do it tomorrow (Tuesday) and it still hasn‚Äôt been done. \n\nAnyway, as she‚Äôs sitting on the couch on her phone, she proceeds to give me a list of things we need, kitchen rolls etc. I just say nothing. At this point I‚Äôm cleaning the sink with my back turned to her. She then has the audacity to say ‚ÄúI hate that only the 3 of us ever clean around here‚Äù \nI actually laugh out loud and say nothing else. She gets embarrassed and leaves the room. \n\nI confront her later that night, she tells me the kitchen isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù (believe me, is its, I have pictures I can include as well) - and I say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not bad, it‚Äôs disgusting actually‚Äù I tell her I‚Äôm sick of doing everything on my own and buying everything. She just says ‚Äúwell don‚Äôt do it then!‚Äù - and at that point I realised I was getting nowhere and that she‚Äôs content living like a slob. I just leave and we haven‚Äôt spoke since. \n\nRight now she‚Äôs the only one giving me problems. My 2 flatmates have stepped up and been helping! I did get an apology as well. Another one told me she has been struggling and I told her I‚Äôd support her anyway I can and to not worry about cleaning, and arranged for her to take some time off University. She‚Äôs barely home anyway (travelling) and doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of mess or use anything.\n\nAlso, I will say that my room had not been broken into, lock was fine and everything was untouched.\n\nAnyway, that‚Äôs the update! Sorry it‚Äôs quite anticlimactic but just thought I‚Äôd share what happened. If you want the gross pictures from my flat let me know :)",

I walk into the woods behind the campsites to pee. Look over toward the rowdy campsite and see they've stashed a cooler in the woods. I take a peek inside -- it's full of beer. I pick up the cooler and stash it in my car trunk. No alcohol allowed on premises, so who are they gonna tell? Can't complain to the park ranger about their beer getting stolen. I enjoyed every bottle,and used the cooler for many years.",

        "text": "Two years ago I packed my stuff and moved to California for a new job. This job is I'm the northern part along the 101. The area is a farming and agricultural hub. It's the \"country\" if you will. Important for later. I really love the area, I live on a dirt road in a heavily wooded area full of redwoods and running water. My neighbors house sits across the road on a nice piece of land with plenty of space for their 3 goats to roam, forage and do whatever they want. I also have a decent amount of space for whatever I please. \n\nI meet the neighbors, friendly folk it seems. A married couple in their 70s that have lived on this road for a long time. \n\nAt this point I start planning some stuff that I would like to do for my some hobbies. Putting plants on my patio, getting chickens, maybe get a garden going. The area is prime for this so it should be a lot of fun. \n\nMy property sits along a wooded area and is not fenced in. The neighbors goats come and graze in the pasture area, that's cool and whatever. No biggie. But as the weeks go on they start causing issues. \n\nThese things will eat absolutely anything. The first thing of mine they ate was the temporary license plate off my vehicle. Consistently getting into my trash I store in trashcan outside, knocking them over and getting into the bags. Now I'm realizing any type of plant I want to put outside will be gone within a day of planting. \n\nThey also loved shitting on my porch as well as butting heads with other on the porch. I am constantly chasing these things off because I'm now getting annoyed. \n\nI bring these issues up with neighbors and his point of view is \"this is the country, my animals are free to roam and if you want them away then you need to fence your property.\" Now this task is a huge undertaking and damn near impossible due to the layout of the land and the goats ability to climb and navigate through rocky terrain and wooded areas. We have a disagreement but it gets left at that. \n\nBy this point I had gotten some chickens and turned the large dog kennel into a coop for my the girls. I keep their feeder inside it and the goats are now aware and have been enjoying their fair share of my feed. I leave the coop open so the ladies can have access to feed while I leave for the day. My chickens are laying eggs and I am generous with them, giving the neighbors that have the goats plenty to enjoy. \n\nNow the goats know I don't like them and they will stay away when I'm around. I've gotten a garden planted which I have placed a decent barrier around to prevent the goats from getting into\n \nI arrive home one day and the fence is busted down and my garden destroyed. I am furious and have had enough of these goats. I once again confront the neighbor and we get into a verbal altercation. \n\nNow this is all over a year and half +/- time frame and their are plenty of other details I could include but it would really drag this out. \n\nTo make it quick. I dislike this old man now, ive learned he is a greedy asshole and he's going to die a bitter old man. But its important I keep our relationship somewhat friendly for unspecified reasons. \n\nNow a new neighbor has moved into the house that was adjacent to his, he comes with chickens and a rooster. Old man is frustrated with the rooster, he has issues sleeping already and now he gets a nice alarm clock at 7am sharp. Sorry buddy but welcome to the country! So this definitely gives me a good chuckle. For the most part I've come to terms with the goats and make the necessary changes needed to keep things secure. I've ran the goats off enough and thrown enough rocks at the goats that they stay away for the most part. I still can't have a nice porch full of plants though. \n\nOver this time I've grown a love for my hens and birds in general. But certainly since I'm not around all the time they need some protection. A rooster of my own would not only provide this but also add another alarm clock to the old man's morning. \n\nA few months ago as I'm at tractor supply I see the most beautiful sight. A barred rock rooster in all his glory, someone had dumped him there. Well big guy, you're coming home with me! \n\nRocco the rock n roll rooster is now fully integrated into my flock and every morning on the dot he let's out the most amazing crows and I get deep satisfaction at the thought of the old man getting woken up by roosters on both sides of his property. But we live in the country, what do you expect?",

        "text": "First off it was over 6 years ago so back off police. At the college my dad went to there was a computer lab that was difficult, they change the default keystrokes so people lost hours of work when trying to save, it was locked most of the time and so you had to get people to unlock it but they weren't there most times, and the system were so bugged one error check would bring up hundreds (some errors had nothing to do with your work) and another check right after would bring up none.\n\nSo one day the error check problem is happening so he go to the desk and no one is there, but the keys are. He's upset and wanting them to suffer a little he takes the key meaning to hide it for a few days then return it. As he has the key in hand in walks a worker so the stuffs it in his pocket fast. He tells them I need help in the lab so they both get ready to leave and the worker grabs the key ring as the lab was about to close. He checks for the key and doesn't find it and calls out to another worker\n\n\"I can't find the lab key\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's not here\"\n\n\"Great we lost another one\"\n\nAt this point my dad who was worried now can't believe they lost the key before and is no longer worried and works on his project some more when he gets an idea. Later he and one of his friends are working in the lab when the friend is talking about leaving but they won't be able to get in over the weekend. My dad says we can go, it's fine. After they left the friend starts asking questions\n\n\"Why did we leave, we still had work to do\"\n\n\"We can go when ever we want, I have the key\"\n\n\"No way you have the key\"\n\nAfter checking he showed the key. He had kept it as now he had the key to the lab that was always locked. He was going to return it at the end of the semester, but when that time came he thought \"This would be a nice addition to my souvenirs\" So to this day he still has that key and all of his other souvenirs.",

        "text": "I used to be a Boy Scout leader. Our chartering organization was a church. An integral part of the church building was a multi-purpose room that included high ceilings and wooden floor striped for basketball, volleyball, and whatever else. Basically a full-court basketball court that could be used for other stuff.\n\nOne week, our Scout meeting involved a lively game of basketball, because why not, right? At one point, I ducked out of the gym to get a drink of water. I was accosted by a Karen, and we had this conversation while I headed to the water fountain and back to the gym.\n\n\"You're the leader of those boys, right?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, don't you think they're being too loud?\"\n\nMy brain skidded to a halt. It's a gym, and we're playing basketball, duh. \"No ma'am, this is a regular Scout meeting.\"\n\n\"This is a church building. I think you would have some reverence and respect.\"\n\nI thought for a moment. The boys weren't running through the halls or the sanctuary. There were no other meetings going on in the building, except for the pastor, who was in his office counseling with parishioners. The rest of the building was dark and silent.\n\n\"Sounds to me like they're just 'making a joyful noise unto the Lord', and rejoicing in the bodies that God has blessed them with.\" I admit I wasn't sincere when I said this. But I didn't care.\n\n\"Well, we'll see what the pastor has to say about this. I'm sure he doesn't appreciate you encouraging the boys to be so irreverent in the house of the Lord!\" &lt;- Camel-case that, or read it aloud in a Karen voice.\n\nSo I mumbled some kind of \"whatever . . .\" response, and headed back into the gym. I went to center court, and called the boys around me.\n\n\"Some lady out in the lobby thinks you boys are being too loud.\"\n\nTheir faces fell. Oh, they looked sad.\n\n\"Well, I don't think you're being loud ENOUGH. I wanna hear some NOISE!\"\n\nThey started whooping and yelling, and we went back to the game with gusto.\n\nAbout five minutes later, one of the doors opened and the pastor stuck his head in. He looked around,  grinned and waved at his son, and then closed the door and went back to his office.\n\nI didn't see Karen again. I guess she had to go  home and whitewash her sepulchre or something.",
