Rule out the solutions in the 1961 novel that appear unlawful and too dicey, such as [deliberately self-inflicting wounds or a crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-inflicted_wound)\n\n\n&gt;['Danby, Orr planned it that way. Don't you understand--he planned it that way from the beginning. He even practiced getting shot down. He rehearsed for it on every mission he flew. And I wouldn't go with him! Oh, why wouldn't I listen? He invited me along, and I wouldn't go with him! Danby, bring me buck teeth too, and a valve to fix and a look of stupid innocence that nobody would ever suspect of any cleverness. I'll need them all. Oh, why wouldn't I listen to him. Now I understand what he was trying to tell me. I even understand why that girl was hitting him on the head with her shoe.'](https://www.allfreenovel.com/Page/Story/50109/page-130-of-Catch-22--Catch-22-1-/130/132)\n\n### and fleeing to Sweden.\n\n&gt;['But they'll find you,' Major Danby argued desperately, 'and bring you back and punish you even more severely.'](https://www.allfreenovel.com/Page/Story/50109/page-130-of-Catch-22--Catch-22-1-/130/132)\n\nGetting shot down or crashing a plane could have maimed or killed Orr, obviously! [Sweden and the USA signed an extradition treaty on 14 March 1983](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/10-201.22-Sweden-EU-Extradition-Treaty.pdf).  \n\n# 1. How would you gainsay Yossarian's Catch-22 with solely logic, to excuse Yossarian from flying on the ground of insanity? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic\\)#Logic\\)) logically formulated it.\n\n# 2. Or would you need to plead some other excuse ASIDE insanity, e.g. physical illness? But this feels like a strawman fallacy, because now I'm changing the premises behind this original Catch-22!\n\n#### https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/q/95809",

        "text": "Hello, me and a few friends were wondering what Sly, a monkey with an augmented brain who lives in a sort of small zoo, actually physically does in this short stories when he \"grabs himself\". This is the exerpt:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In the courtyard beyond the glass, a group of school kids leapt back,  \nlaughing. One of them swung his arms aping Sly crudely. Sly bared his  \nteeth, knowing these people would take it as a grin, but he meant it as a  \nthreat. Swinging down from his stool, he crossed his room in three long  \nstrides and pressed his dirty hand against the window. Still grinning, he  \nwrote SSA. Outside, the letters would be reversed.  \nThe student’s teacher flushed as red as a female in heat and called the  \nchildren away from the window. She looked back once as she led them out  \nof the courtyard, so Sly grabbed himself and showed her what he would do  \nif she came into his pen.  \nHer naked face turned brighter red and she hurried away. When they  \nwere gone, Sly rested his head against the glass. The metal in his skull  \nthunked against the window. It wouldn’t be long now, before a handler  \ncame to talk to him. \n\n\"Evil Robot Monkey\" by George Mann\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?",

I’m mostly focused on American literature. I’m trying to find more that I’ve not included in my paper yet so any suggestion would be appreciated. I’ve worked with these already:\n1. The View from Mrs Thompson’s by David Foster Wallace \n2. Leap by Brian Doyle\n3. Barbara Kingsolver’s essays \n4. Fixed Ideas by Joan Didion\n5.  Falling Man by Tom Junod\n6. In the Ruins of the Future by Don DeLillo \n\nIf you have any ideas please let me know! I was thinking speeches that were later published would also work but it’s a struggle to find them. Maybe some of you remember them 😌",

This was the first time I read anything by the author, and I must say: it's hard to put a word on my feelings. \n\nOverall, I'd say that I enjoyed the book. But there are two things that kind of fiddled with it. \n\n1. I had resumed reading it after a few years, and decided to resume my reading from where I had stopped previously. Admittedly, it was not a smart decision, but I still tried to follow. This was not helped by\n2. I was somewhat hermetic to Dickens's prose style. It is so wordy that it was hard to follow at times. \n3. The representation of the French Revolution was fair, but you can certainly feel that it was from a 19th century Victorian man trying to write fiction. It greatly differed from the generally more positive representation we have in current-day France. \n\nAside from that, it was still an enjoyable read. I still found the characters likable, and it offered a decent amount of moral ambiguity that still made it enjoyable (that was one of the ways the book's portrayal of the Revolution was fair). \n\nAnything to discuss?",

It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now.”\n\n—Gravity’s Rainbow, Thomas Pynchon. This as well as the entire opening scene is brilliant and terrifying. \n\n“Maman died today.

Iconic haunting line from a book that kinda changed my life. \n\nThere’s quite a few more but those are the ones I can think of at the top of my head.",

From [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/06/us/east-palestine-ohio-train-derailment-fire-monday/index.html): \n\n&gt;Five of the derailed train cars are carrying vinyl chloride – a chemical that is currently unstable and could explode, hurling toxic fumes into the air and shooting deadly shrapnel as far as a mile away, officials said.\n\nAn evacuation has also been ordered, just as in the novel, spanning 2 states. &gt;!Nyodene D. is the chemical in White Noise. Heinrich reports to the family possible symptoms such as nausea, skin irritation, and sweaty palms and that Nyodene D. caused lumps in lab rats.!&lt; Symptoms of vinyl chloride exposure include irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, dizziness, sleepiness, headache, nausea, or tingling in the arms and legs. Just as with anxiety about exposure to &gt;!Nyodene D.!&lt; in the novel, especially about its long-term effects, per CNN:\n\n&gt;Breathing high levels of vinyl chloride can make someone pass out or die if they don’t get fresh air, the Ohio Department of Health said. The man-made chemical used to make PVC burns easily at room temperature; can cause dizziness, sleepiness and headaches; and has been linked to an increased risk of cancer in the liver, brain, lungs and blood.\n\nCNN is also reporting crews will try a controlled release of the hazardous chemicals and that there's a high probability of toxic gas release. The derailed cars themselves have been burning for several days already, evoking the imagery from White Noise where &gt;!the burning Nyodene D. emits a \"billowing black cloud.\"!&lt; Furthermore, the government response and American media coverage of the event so far, a theme (&gt;!American consumption of media and obsession far-away disasters to distract from feelings of mortality or anxiety closer to home!&lt;) satirized in the novel seem quite comparable. Just as how the airborne toxic event in the book &gt;!destroys the Gladney family's the disconnect with the apocalyptic perpetuated through their consumption of disasters presented by American media!&lt;, the residents ordered to evacuate around East Palestine, Ohio because of this similar toxic event, are likely going through a similar experience. All in all, reading the American media coverage around this event was what really reminded me of the similarities to this most pivotal event in White Noise.",

        "text": "Hey guys. So I have finished until the end of Act 3 in Hamlet and want your opinions on something (also I don't mind spoilers lol)! Namely, is Hamlet insane? And in your opinion is the plot \"good\"? I know these questions have been asked probably, but I personally want to know your opinions on this, and if my opinion is considered \"surface level\".\n\nI think that his soliloquies, conversation with his mother, and killing Polonius all point to him being at least slightly insane and extremely depressed. He repeatedly claims that he's only acting mad, but I think that his acting is partially an excuse to show his true feelings. I especially don't think I can chalk up Polonius' death to just Hamlet's impulsiveness and depression. I will say though, when he acting mad he's very witty and does seem not truly insane. But in the same vein, in the conversation with Ophelia after \"to be or not to be\", his harshness towards her is paralleled by the disgust he feels towards his mother; essentially, he's even using that conversation as an excuse to reveal how he actually feels. Maybe his actions aren't caused by insanity, but I really don't think they can just be characterized by his rashness either. Thoughts?\n\nAlso, regarding my second question, this is a bit of a sore spot for me because I just had a friend tell me the plot was bad and relies too heavily on strong emotions. However, I don't think this makes the plot \"bad\"; Hamlet's emotions comprise the entire plot. Yes, he's irrational, impulsive, and generally an unlikable person, but he carries the plot \\*because\\* of it and I think so far it's been well-written. I'd really like to hear your opinions on what you thought of the play itself.",

Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met nearly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.”",

Who sent the assassin in the Mexican prison? Originally my thought was the prison was just a terribly violent place, which it was, but then rereading the portion it sounds like someone had hired the gentleman to kill him. Is this correct or was it just another random violent attack?",

(No real spoilers).\n\n1) I did not mind the stream of consciousness. I felt like I was able to follow along and enjoy it. I didn’t get bogged down. Contrast this with Ulysses which I haven’t been able to finish yet (tried multiple times! I will finish it one day I swear). Why do you suppose that is? I was wondering if perhaps it’s not the stream of consciousness that makes Ulysses so difficult but all of the references to things I’m completely unfamiliar with? Either way, I liked Faulkner’s usage of thought speech very much, especially in Quentin’s chapter. \n\n2) Lord have mercy, is Jason not the most insufferable person? I can’t think of a piece of literature where the reader spends so much time inside the head of someone so toxic. He was truly well written and believable and obnoxious. I wonder how he was received when the novel first came out? Do you suppose that readers were more sympathetic to him back then, I wonder?",
