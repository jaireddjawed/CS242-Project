This is how the cult of the game began and became. \n\nEach countries cities, sisters to one-another, would form the club. From club there became duality. Why? Because, if one was rejected by the team whom he wished to be, due to our nature, we react dialectically. If I am not yours, then I will become that of the other! Duality of opinion is inherent, due to duality of intersubjectivity. \n\nSince the city began before the becoming of the chosen eleven, there is no need to quarrel over the choice. \n\nWhat would become, is glory but also disdain. Brotherhood intertwined with alienation. One is, but one also is not, what one wishes to become, to be. \n\nUnity in choice manifests glory. Though our agencies decision destines oneself to detriment. To seek, only for it to not be, creates disappointment, pain and misery. Will decides its own destruction. It is so and cannot be otherwise. \n\nThough, if what is sought is achieved, then the destined detriment understandably avidly flees. Why? Because sameness and like-to-like being cannot be. Difference is all. It is all one can or could ever be.",
