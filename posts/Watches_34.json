The numbers and hands glow very slightly in the dark, I guess it would have been much brighter when new.\n\nThanks for having a look",

I do prefer the 34mm caseback but 40mm seems to be tard short, 42mm would be ideal.\n\nThe 38mm caseback lug to lug is 43mm with some change. If only there's a 36mm version with a lug to lug 42mm-44mm out there.\n\nThat's all, this is a psa for those equally as intrigued as me about the 34mm jazzmaster performer auto time only.",

I just have to decide whether I would like hand wound or automatic, and I also need to decide which size I would like (being the Flieger Classic, either 36mm or 40mm). \n\nFor reference, my wrist circumference is 6.75\"/17cm. My wrist diameter is roughly 5cm. Having printed a few templates, I definitely prefer the size of the dial of the 40mm version, and I know that Fliegers are meant to be big watches. \n\nAt the same time, I don't want the lugs to overhang the sides of my wrists. My wrists are quite small, but the 36mm really doesn't seem like it would be big enough. I'm really torn, and this is going to be my first \"proper\" watch and I don't really want to drop 1250 EUR on the watch, have it shipped all the way to where I live and then dislike the size. \n\nPlease let me know if anyone has any insight or tips!",

I tried buying a deplyant strap but I ended up having to cut it to the last hole and the clasp ended up being on the side of my wrist and was uncomfortable. I saw delugs has some rubber straps you can cut on both ends but they're like $150 and I was hoping not to spend that much and ideally I'd like to use straps I already have. That being said do you know of any claps that use some sort of mechanism to allow me to cut each end of a strap and make it a deplyant clasp? \n\nThanks in advance for the help",

I love the big crown as it has the red pointer date with the second movement. But there’s something about the Tudor that keeps me coming back. Could also go with a Seiko Alpinist in blue to save some money for a bigger purchase down the line. For reference my wrist is 7.5 inches so if these options are too small, I would love some other automatic suggestions (automatic, blue dial, refined sporty watch). Would love to hear some thoughts and opinions on these three! Thank you.",

I was originally dead set on the 126710BLNR, but the AD experience is nothing like it was when I got my 116610LN 4 years ago and I'm unwilling to go grey. At some point I got a look at the JLC Master Geographic and it's managed to worm its way into my mind over time to the point where I'm not so sure about the GMT Master II anymore. The JLC is a hair more money, will have lower resale value (not that it matters), and be harder to service when the time comes... on the other hand, it's far more unique and beautiful (to me), easier to dress up, and I can safely wear it anywhere (nobody will know what the hell it is). It's also readily available...\n\nAnyone out there have to make this call or actually own the Master Geographic that wants to chime in?",
