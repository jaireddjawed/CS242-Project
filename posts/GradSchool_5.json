It has been freezing up my computer or shutting down the program multiple times in the middle of class. I like the ability to take notes on the PowerPoints themselves and I like being paperless as my computer is so easy and convenient to write on/take notes on. Has anyone else been having issues with that program? What has been a good tool for you?",

For me, that means I have 5 days of written exams, each lasting 4-8 hrs.   \n\n\nFor those who had multi-day exams, how did you deal with the fatigue of high intense stress/writing over multiple days?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/11kas9y/question_from_a_recent_grad_school_admittee_how/",
        "text": "This is my first post to this sub. I recently got admitted into a MSc program for CS at the same institution where I completed my undergrad. This is all well and good, but I just received a group email from my supervisor regarding allowances for travel expenses when presenting conference papers. Maybe I'm just ignorant, but I was unaware that I might be expected to travel as part of my academic duties prior to this interaction. \n\nThe problem arises from the fact that I cannot, due to a variety of personal circumstances, travel long distances or be away from home for extended periods. This is partially due to my own medical issues, as both the symptoms of my condition and the nature of my prescribed medications make travel extremely difficult. Moreover, I am the sole caretaker for an elderly relative who cannot be left alone for extended periods of time. I am listed as having a disability on my school's records, but the nature of my condition is such that nobody would know I have a problem unless I explicitly tell them. For obvious reasons, I am reluctant to make my medical history public; thus, nobody outside of the administration knows the exact nature of my disability.\n\nThis brings me to my question: how much of an issue is this likely to be? I suppose I could just opt not to submit to conference papers, but this might be challenging in CS and close many doors to me. Alternatively, I might be able to arrange a remote presentation or have a co-author present on my behalf, but this comes with its own issues. I'm also uncertain about how I should proceed with my supervisor. I haven't said anything thus far, as I don't particularly want to discuss my medical history and familial circumstances with someone I don't know very well. Is it necessary for me to discuss this with my supervisor? If so, how much detail should I give? I don't want to get in trouble for blindsiding anyone with this, but I also don't want to sacrifice my privacy or overwhelm them with too much information.",

Every time I think I might finally have a break to recover, there's always another assignment or TA responsibility I have to deal with.\n\nMost of my issue is I know I'm good at research. I know for a fact that I could sit there and put out better research than 80% of the people in my cohort right now. But I have to sit here and struggle through these classes, barely scraping by (since the official grad school guidelines declare the minimum GPA as a 3.0), burning myself out, desperate to crawl through until I can get to the part I actually enjoy and am good at.\n\nWith how little time I've had to practice hobbies or research, I feel like I'm not good at anything but homework anymore, and I get genuinely angry every time I think about this. \n\nThere's people in my classes though who seem completely unfazed by all this, who are completely able to keep up, and this is honestly baffling to me.

Unfortunately, I’m not willing to go through the process of applying to grad schools to perhaps get a position as an Econ PhD student since, among other things, that would require me to ask my professors who wrote my LORs to write (or send) them again, but this time to a department that has nothing to do with their own. The option I’m thus left with is: taking Econ PhD classes as a math student. I was wondering if anyone here would have gone through a similar experience and could tell whether that’s normally possible. Naturally, I asked my own graduate program about this possibility (though I asked if I could take classes from the Statistics department, not Economics) and they said I can as long as it’s approved by the graduate committee. The criteria for what is or isn’t approved, however, aren’t clear for me. Hence, the reason for my question. It might be worth stressing that, although I’m currently in pure math, I plan to migrate to applied math since they are both under the same department and that might make my life easier when it comes to convincing my home department to take classes from other departments.",

It was the only one that didnt require letters of recommendation or a statement of purpose. I submitted the statement of purpose anyway, but the only other thing was my transcripts. I got a 3.2 undergrad GPA, but I'm aware that a 3.5 is a typical average for a decent school, and i'm sure its much higher for the Hopkins in-person grad program, not to mention the other criteria for admission.   \n\n\nKnowing this, how serious will the program be/how much attention will we get from the school toward our education, and how dignified can I feel showing a future employer this degree on my resume?  \n\n\n[https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/space-systems-engineering/](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/space-systems-engineering/) \\- Program Website",

I like the financial management (budgeting, cost proposals, accruals, financial reporting, invoicing, accounting, payments, bank account management, payroll), and operations (setting up systems for projects/company, HR, policies, travel management) aspects. I haven’t found any masters programs I felt would help better prepare me to be in this type of financial management. A lot of the MBA and finance programs I see seem to be much more focused on finance in an external way, instead of project/company operations. Does anyone have any ideas? Or experience in a program that might fit?\n\nOther points: I’d like to participate in a program where I can do in-person classes but also work at least part time at my current job (current job could be requested to be remote). I’d also like to stay on the east coast of US (currently living in N. Virginia). Lastly, I’d love to be able to get a scholarship or some tuition assistance or go somewhere more affordable, I don’t expect to work in a field where I’ll make a ton ton of money so I don’t necessarily want to pay full price for a school that will be $100k+",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm having some difficulty trying to decide between an MD or a PhD in Neuroscience. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post!\n\nFor some context, I just graduated from university a semester early in December, and I'm now working full-time as a Research Associate for a well-known neuroscience institute in the US with very accomplished PIs. My plan throughout college was to go to medical school (I took all the required classes, did all the activities, was in research for 3 years, got 1 publication, etc...) but now I'm having doubts about whether I actually want to get my MD. I've taken the MCAT twice, and my most recent score is fine, but not great (I think I'd have some trouble getting into MD schools given that I'm ORM). I've taken some time to really think about if I want to retake it again before this upcoming cycle, but I just have no motivation whatsoever.\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, I've tried to draft my PS for med school apps, but I'm realizing I don't actually have a straightforward answer as to why I want to be a doctor/go to medical school. It seems like I'm trying to force an answer to align with what adcoms are looking for in a future doctor, and now I'm worried I haven't really given med school serious thought. It just seemed like the go-to path for an undergrad like me who loves neuroscience and the brain. I should also add that I kinda skimped out on clinical volunteering in undergrad -- I got clinical experience through other activities aside from being a medical assistant in the hospital or being an EMT, and thinking about doing those things doesn't really excite me.\n\nI've shadowed psychiatrists, a neuroradiologist, and a neurologist, and while they were all rewarding experiences, I started asking myself if I'd get bored of the routine/monotony of seeing patients every day. I also should note that every single one of these doctors told me \"it wasn't too late to change my mind\" about med school, and while I thought they were joking, I am now wondering why each doctor made the same comment. Some people really like the stability and predictability of being a practicing physician, but idk I feel like I would get bored easily.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\n**About me:**\n\n\\- I love writing, the brain, neuroscience, passionate about mental health/illnesses, also interested in criminal justice (thought I wanted to go to law school my first year of college lol)\n\n\\- comfortable being around people, I like being social and giving presentations gives me some anxiety but I'm able to do them fine\n\n\\- terrible at memorizing facts (this worries me if I were to go to med school), especially memorizing things I'm genuinely not interested in\n\n\\- bad at bio (I find some things interesting, but I don't really understand the bigger picture sometimes)\n\n\\- my undergrad research was in an autism lab, and my honors thesis was also about this population but using neuroimaging techniques/fMRI scans and data (I LOVED working on this project and got the highest distinction after review)\n\n**Reasons FOR MD:**\n\n\\- job stability, very good pay\n\n\\- neuroradiology/neurology could be interesting specialties\n\n\\- be able to prescribe medicine (idk if I really care about doing this tho?)\n\n**Concerns about MD:**\n\n\\- lot of debt and so many years of schooling including residency and fellowships... also I don't think I'm going to succeed if I have to memorize and recall things I'm not really interested in\n\n\\- dealing with patients every day would wear me out I think\n\n\\- idk if I really see myself directly helping people every day\n\n**Reasons FOR PhD:**\n\n\\- I'll get to work on what I know I'm passionate about and be intellectually curious\n\n\\- be at the forefront of science -- a step ahead of just prescribing patients medicine/drugs -- helping future individuals indirectly rather than providing immediate care as a physician\n\n\\- not as much schooling/time, also won't really be in debt (hopefully)\n\n\\- working in my job right now I'm seeing firsthand how well-connected neuroscientists are, and the community is really spectacular. I love how PIs collaborate with each other across the world and each one of them kinda has a \"brand\". Idk if this is a good/correct way to think about this, but being a great neuroscientist is appealing to me because I'll be well-known for my hard work and papers, whereas being a great doctor kinda makes me well-known in my community for helping people? (Don't mean to offend anyone I'm just thinking through my values and how I find myself being fulfilled)\n\n\\- eventually will get to speak at conferences and I can see myself being really proud of my work and discoveries and wanting to speak about them\n\n**Concerns about PhD:**\n\n\\- job security? Maybe I don't want to be a professor for the rest of my life? I know some people go into consulting, I could see myself maybe going into biotech, but how likely is this? Maybe starting a company?\n\n\\- pay isn't that great? Although one of my thesis mentors who has a PhD makes close to $400k...but not sure how\n\n\\- will this degree actually be worth it? I've heard/read mixed things\n\n\\- worried maybe I'll get bored of the *process* of research (not that I'll get bored of neuro interests, but grant writing, admin things like that)\n\nAgain, sorry for the lengthy post but I really wanted to give the full picture here. I'm really conflicted and not sure what to do... I also am just now starting my gap year and I don't know if I want to take another one. MD apps are due this June, and PhD apps wouldn't be due until Decemberish. Any and all advice/insight would be super helpful!! Thanks everyone in advance!!",

        "text": "For my 4th year committee meeting yesterday, I presented two first author papers I am working on. One will be a co-first authorship and is almost ready to be written. The other paper is a little underdeveloped but I have spent a lot of time developing tools to answer these questions and I believe they are ready to be implemented. For context, only one first-author paper is required to graduate and it doesn’t matter if it’s a co-first authorship. This is in vivo immunology and one paper is the standard for PhDs in our department (US, R1 university). \n\nHere is where I messed up: I was candid with them and told them I didn’t want to develop any tools anymore and I felt kind of discouraged that my peers utilized established tools to quickly generate data and put together a nice discovery. I told them that I love genomics and would be thrilled with if I spent the last year of my PhD just analyzing large data sets within the context of our research questions. Mouse work causes me a lot of distress so I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I asked them what they thought of me only doing the genomics aspect of the underdeveloped study. They all gave me general thoughts and said I should just focus on the first, more developed paper for now. \n\nAfterwards, my advisor rushed in to my office and told me I undersold myself and was such a downer in the meeting. She said made it look like I did nothing and that I was just hungry for data I can analyze mindlessly. I thought committee members were supposed to be for advice? And that you’re meant to bring the research ideas that need a little help and get that help within the space of a committee meeting? They had already seen my yearly work in progress update two days prior, so what was the point of this meeting if not advice?\n\nAnyway now I’m sitting here worried that my committee thinks I’m just this mindless student who is looking for data and papers when the reality is that I just love the dry lab aspect of things.",
