And when I was allowed to play them I usually had to make the most of the time i had so i usually only did the bare minimum so i could actually play through the game’s main campaign. As a result this led to a bad gamer habit im trying to break where Im usually in a rush to beat the game ASAP. And I was wanting to ask how you all go about side content in games?\n\nDo you usually beat the main story then go for the side stuff? Do you do a mix of both? Or do you do as much side stuff as you can before going through with the main campaign? \n\nOf course some games like to hide the main story behind level caps or completion progress. So sometimes you’re forced to do side stuff. So how you all usually go about that may offer some interesting discussion as well?",

        "text": "The [report](https://newzoo.com/insights/trend-reports/pc-console-gaming-report-2023) is out, and while still behind some walls, some highlights (emphasis, selection and editorialization are mine):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* While everyone and their dog is calling this year some variation of a \"downturn\", at least they point out in the first page this is a just a correction post-lockdowns. It's not really \"down\", it was just artificially high before.\n* PC and consoles games generated **92.3 billion USD** in 2022, -2.2% year on year.\n* **1.1 billion PC players**.\n* **611 million console players**.\n* **Console** games value was **51.8 billion** USD, -4.2% YoY. To divide between Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo.\n* **PC** games value was **40.5 billion USD** (including 2.3 for browser games). No division here, PC is one platform, so still *by far* the biggest videogames platform (after mobile, of course). Both numbers include in-game spending and subscriptions.\n* Average playtime dropped by 23% from 2021 to 2022. Yup, lockdowns.\n* From that 92.3Bn pie, geographically: North America generated 34%, Asia-Pacific 33%, Europe 26%, Latin America 5%, Middle East and Africa 3%. US alone is 29Bn, while China alone is 15.2Bn.\n* They estimate a total of current major consoles sold (PS5, Switch, Xbox Series) of 208 million at the end of 2023.\n* Over 100 billion hours spent playing on PC and console in 2022.\n* While Fortnite has the largest Monthy Active Users (MAU) on Xbox and Playstation, it's behind Pokemon Scarlet/Violet on Switch, and behind Roblox then Call of Duty on PC.\n* Apex Legends is the top MAU in Japan.\n* As of genres, by player share it's ranked Adventure, Shooter, Battle Royale, Sports, Role playing, Fighting, Platformer, Racing, Sandbox, Simulation. But that moves a lot by playtime, with shooter first and fighting, platformer, and racing being way last.\n* I**n-game spending was almost 50%** of PC and console **revenue**. Both platforms have around 31% of revenue through microtransaction, but console players spend more on DLC while PC players spend 9% more on buying the games themselves.\n* More than half the top PC and consoles games were free-to-play.\n* They mark 40% of gamers being women, lower than most but in the ballpark of various studies and analysis.\n* **34% of PC/console gamers didn't spent money** on games in the past 6 months.\n* Through self-identifying, 40% of gamers are \"core gamers\" that play an average of 9hr a week with 82% of them paying for games, while 25% are \"casual gamers\" playing an average of 4.5hr a week with 42% paying for games.\n* Ranked between fantasy and science-fiction, survival is the second most appealing setting/theme to gamers.\n* **Exploration is the strongest motivation and appeal** for non \"casual\" gamers.\n* **75%** of PC and console gamers are **engaging with games beyond just playing** (like watching streams or videos, podcast, online discussion and socialization, etc.) The younger they are, the more they do most of it.\n* **29%** of gamers engaged with **both PC and consoles**, while 39% engaged only in PC, 32% only in console. I discounted mobile, the report has the full breakdown, but 28% of these gamers have a single platform and don't play on anything else (including mobile).\n* 66% of gamers are unaware of cloud gaming. 42% of those aware didn't play a cloud game.\n* 17% of PC/console gamers are \"big spenders\", defined as an average of $25+ a month the past 6 months.\n*",

Such inquisitive hunters will relish the Nightmare. But beware, secrets are secrets for a reason, and some do not wish to be discovered.

I did..”\n\nThis scene is absolutely heartbreaking. Literally makes me(and my non-gamer wife) cry.\n\nHalo 2, Master Chief to Admiral Lord Hood:\n\n“Sir. Finishing this fight.”\n\nMy 11 year old brain thought this was so freakin badass. So does my 30 year old brain.\n\nThe Last of Us, Joel to Ellie:\n\n“Oh baby girl… it’s okay.

        "text": "When call of Duty started innovating and released blackout, their first Battle Royale mode, it was terrific. The graphics and textures were crisp and clean, everything was well designed and flowed smoothly. The game mode was insanely fun and easily intuitive for new players. It was a blast all around. I was less enthused and impressed by call of Duty modern warfare warzone, But still, it had its charm, it was relatively fun. \n\n\n\nWarzone 2.0 however, is one of the worst experiences that I've ever had in a game. I thought the mostly negative 33% review that it has on steam was some sort of joke. But after playing it for about 40 hours, that score is probably way more than it deserves. The game is barely functional at times, ridden with bugs, nearly every single match you get put into, at least one or two of your teammates is a bot that will just fall into the ocean and repeatedly move slightly so they don't get kicked from the match. \n\n\n\nModern warfare 2 is a little bit better, but still, god-awful. One of the worst FPS games in the entire gaming industry right now. I'm playing it free because apparently there's a free trial going on, and I wanted to jump into the ground war mode to see how it compares to battlefield 2042. The map is absolutely massive, the vehicles are lackluster and unimpressive. It's a lot of just running in one direction without much of any action at all until you eventually see a sniper glint and instantly die, wait 10 seconds, repeat it again. There was literally nothing fun at all about playing modern warfare 2's ground mode. Literally nothing. It's an extremely bland and terribly optimized generic game that they want you to pay $70 for. That has to be a joke right?\n\n\n\nEveryone likes to really hate on battlefield 2042, but when I played it during the free weekend they were offering, it wasn't even that bad at all. The gunplay was fun, working as a team was fun. Being a medic and being able to revive people, and play in a support role was fulfilling and interesting. After my last stint with battlefield, which was battlefield V, I thought I was done playing it. But I've been having way more fun playing battlefield than I have with call of Duty. I suppose it's because battlefield once again finally feels a little bit more like itself. Call of Duty, however, feels like a much, much worse version of battlefield\n\n\n\nI feel like an honorable mention by the way has to be Counter-Strike global offensive. It's one of the most played games on steam, and I thought it has to be worth trying. I did try it out, I'm terrible at the game, but damn, that game was hilariously fun.",

We've all played the bed of chaos.\n\n\nAnno: Mutationem \n\nThis game is just a wonderful sci-fi cyberpunk gem up until the last half an hour or so where you are tasked with protecting a character casting a spell.\n\nMore enemies than have ever been sent after you get spawned from all directions and are all only interested in hitting this character. They spawn either side and in the air. You have no knock-back potential and your directional damage is incredibly limited. \n\nSo ensues three increasingly frustrating to kill waves of enemies with 60 seconds of time wasting bullet dodging between each one. \n\nFor some enemies you can single hit kill them with a parry, but then an overlong animation plays for the kill where you hit the enemy multiple times. Unfortunatley this doesn't hit any other enemies, and also they just walk past and hit the character.\n\nThe game even spawns a flying enemy out of your reach that you have to time a jumping attack perfectly to just nip their hitbox above you - and even that is 50/50.\n\nSuffice to say I turned the difficulty down to easy to get it over with and skipped all the dialogue from then on because I just wanted it to be over. It was certainly a moment where I've asked \"Who was this for?\" \"Why is this in here?\" and \"Was this even playtested?\". Nothing about the games mechanics supported this room, and there wasn't even a test of skill.\n\nBUT. It did get me thinking about moments in other games that have utterly ruined the experience and made sure I've never come back. Another example being Sonic Generations final boss, or that Catherine level where you have to lead Katherine through the puzzle...\n\nHas anyone else got any personal picks that they remember \"fondly?\"",

I am interested in differences in basic cognitive processing elicited by playing fast-paced video games (which is why I am currently only looking for people who play shooters) and aim to expand the scientific knowledge in the area of cognitive control.\n\nIt is necessary that participants have a very good command of English, are not color blind, and do not suffer from any neurological or psychological disorders of attention. It is important to open the study via the link below on a PC (not tablet/smartphone etc.). The study will only take about 30 minutes to complete.\n\nParticipants can win 5x30€ vouchers for amazon (there will be a maximum of 50 participation slots available), and better performance on the tasks will increase the likelihood of winning.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11sfk44/how_no_more_heroes_crafts_a_strong_boss_battle/",
        "text": "Having recently played (and watched) through the No More Heroes series I realized how little time the actual bosses spend on screen. Yet they still define the game series so much that any discussion needs to dedicate a substantial amount of time towards them.  \nThe best example is Ghenry Perez and his in depth look into the games and how the themes of the games are centered around the clashing motives and being foils to the protagonist Travis Touchdown.  \nReally short summary of the games:  \nTravis is an assassin and wants to reach rank 1 on a list in the first game, because he wants to get laid as he is an otaku-neet and a woman promises him that.  \nIn the second game he wants to reach rank 1 to challenge the final boss who killed his best friend, after Travis killed his family in an optional side mission in the first game.  \nThe third game is a little too much to get into.   \nIn the fourth game he is defending earth from invading aliens and the ranking thing remains to stop the aliens from obliterating him together and using their own vanity against them.   \nSo he just wants to beat number 1 to save earth.  \n\n\nNow that I critically think about them, I think I have isolated the main points of these boss battles and how they are effectively used. \n\n0. Depth: Every good boss can be analyzed towards a greater scope target.   \nI want to use Holly Summers as an example as she is probably one of the most important bosses in the whole series, despite having only 3 minutes of dialogue, actually died in her fight and then did not return in any capacity. While only being rank 6 out of 10.  \n\n\n1. Visual Design  \nThe first impression is most of the time a visual one. The characters are visually extremely diverse and combine different motives with the idea of being a killer.   \nHolly Summers is a conventionally attractive woman and is in universe a former beauty. But it gets contrasted with her missing one leg and pseudo military garment.  It uses her femininity as a contrast with her military gear which leads to a problem the main character is facing: the ability to kill woman as his former targets were all men and also implicitly seeing woman as lesser which is the reason they need special protection, and he can not kill them. \n\n2. Strong Focussed Dialogue  \n[Link to a Game FAQ guide that contains the dialogue.](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/wii/933024-no-more-heroes/faqs/52222)  \nThe confrontation is to the point, she asks Travis questions which he then slams.  \nAt this point Travis is still immature and thinks that he is untouchable or at least pretends to feel untouchable and know no (personal) pain.  \nThe implication is that Holly Summers as a military veteran has already experienced the fear of death and does not think of taking a life lightly. Travis has yet to learn this lesson as everyone he faced up to this point was either despicable or a fighting junkie.   \nAs they both interact with each other, a whimsical element of fun comes up as Travis falls into a trap (a hole trap). She seems genuinely entertained which takes away from the serious drama only to reenter the scenario when Travis wins the fight, and he can't bring himself to kill her. \n\nThis leads to her suicide as she respects his prowess and has sympathy with him and because of that she kills herself as she lost the fight. Reminding him with her final words that he can't show mercy as a real assassin, but asking him to remember her. The implication being that she was a worthy opponent (despite her perceived weakness as a woman) and that he please should not forget her because of that. He needs to be able to bear the sin of killing an actual human and the consequences it brings him. No more caricatures, real breathing humans that even can show affection towards him, something we will later learn, he lacked over the course of his whole life.\n\n3. Real Life References (potential interpretation)  \nHolly Summers is a critical interpretation of a military veteran and how someone over the course of a war can get desensitized towards the atrocities that can be committed.   \nIn real life military veterans are often without support systems after returning from war and have deep underlying issues with  the material that they have been confronted with. As such they tend to be unstable and unable to continue to live a normal life.   \nHolly Summers takes this idea to an extreme as she becomes an assassin who uses military tactics and weapons to exterminate her target. Be it grenades and trap holes which kill unanimously their respective targets and anyone who accidentally would step into  the line of fire, even if they were civilians.  \nIn contrast, she is speaking of how much death matters on an individual level and how everything pales in comparison. This could be interpreted as a conflict of skill and intention. She understands force as a last effort, but has no other options which makes it her default reaction.  \nThis also leads to her believing that on a grand scale she does not matter, just like war ignores the individuals, and we do not remember the soldiers who died on the battlefield. Her last wish being that Travis remembers her name, being defiant to a destiny that she knew she could not stop, but still did not want to accept. So that at least something of her lives on through him, just like soldiers carry the names of their dead comrades.   \nThere are definitely layers to her character but without proper material or discussion with people like Suda51 (director of the game and very much hands on), it is only possible to speculate.   \nAlbeit the implications are so strong that the thematic depth at least is implied to be for discussion or that there is a “correct” interpretation.\n\n 4. Travis' Character Growth  \nHaving dedicated so much time to Holly Summers, the protagonist Travis fell out of scope, but his reaction to her death is the first time he is emotionally compromised. He does not want to hear her life story, but only asks the promoter of the assassin tournament for her name as that is what she wanted him to remember her for. Accepting the burden of his kill, and it finally sets in that the people he kills are actual people.  \nTravis is an otaku-neet and many aspects of No More Heroes relate to the grind of hardcore gamers that only have interest in their games (Travis assassination jobs) who then \"grind\" real life (aka the side jobs in the game) to enjoy their escape from reality.   \nHolly Summers breaks him out of this mold and plants the seed of rejection within him. He remains an assassin in  NMH2 but finally puts a stop to that after having another emotional confrontation, directly stating that the assassins he kills are humans and how these rankings are degrading their human worth.   \nIn the third game he accepts that his assassination task would endanger the family he could have and withdraws to protect them.  \nWhich then leads to him becoming an actual hero in No More Heroes 3, having grown as a character, embracing his bonds with people, reconnecting with the real world and finally becoming an unambiguous good guy that wants to save the world.   \nWhich ties into the final confrontation when he asks the main antagonist the same questions that Holly did (something that happened 12 years ago at this point in timeline).   \nThe antagonist answering the same way he previously did and him realizing how infantile his enemy is. He kept his promise and understands the weight of his actions, but can accept it with a maturity he did not have at that point in time. All that without name-dropping or using flashbacks, because the link is obvious enough.  \nThe fight has lasting consequences and is important for the journey Travis has over the course of his life, and it makes sense that such a traumatic experience will influence him. The player also may start to connect the dots at this point and realizes how the game played him, just like for example Fight Club “plays” the viewer. Travis is not cool, he is just a man child who is out of his water when he confronts her and finally realized what he is doing.   \n\n\n5. The Actual Fight  \nArguably the weakest aspect of the fight, she uses a shovel as a melee weapon with the implication that she prepared the traps with it, while also using grenades and rockets to hit Travis from afar.  \nHer military and model background get combined when she poses like a model when she sends out her rockets. This is probably because of that limitations of the Wii and the fact that she was only one of multiple bosses and that No More Heroes seemingly never had more than AA budget.   \nWhile limited, they managed to create ludo narrative resonance and have a kit for a character that stays true to the portrayal.   \n\n\nConclusion  \nHolly Summers is a memorable boss because of her flipping the script on Travis and making him reflect on the person he wants to be, a motive which all No More Heroes game use but first gets established with her.  \nAll the while being an implicit critique of the military complex and how it treats its soldiers after suffering from trauma and how desolate the situation can be. While also formulating the hypothetical scenario of a woman soldier turned assassin who wants to retain humanity:  \nAlthough she has grown disillusioned and still hopes for the main character to overcome what she could not, a moment of genuine humaneness. Which makes it more hard hitting that Travis is responsible for extinguishing this flame of genuine kindness.   \nA flame he would later on find in himself and nourish. Poetry in the image of George Lucas.  \nThat sounds melodramatic, and I would agree, but I hope it hammers home how important this single battle in a series full of outstanding boss battles is.",

        "author": "BillNein05",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11s9jzw/speedrunning_and_its_community_are_still_heavily/",
        "text": "The idea of speedrunning is something that's been around for decades, even before the birth of the term \"speedrunning\" itself. After all, many games developed in the early days considered either high scores or the fastest times as achievements coded into the games themselves, being regularly updated whenever new records were set.\n\nStill, even with the most insane glitches found and records set with some games having literal decades of history of speedrunning development, it hasn't really been given the respect it deserves.\n\nI noticed that in recent times, most of the increased interest came from being introduced to the idea of speedrunning Minecraft, mainly because of the popularity of the YouTuber/streamer \"Dream\". Dream was one of the rare few speedrunners that were mainly famous for something else but were also competent speedrunners able to set records. Of course, the controversy surrounding the RNG manipulation most likely brought even more attention to the concept of speedrunning, although it was still mainly isolated to Minecraft. \n\nIt didn't really help that none of the \"big\" streamers/content creators who are usually responsible for setting trends (i.e. the upper echelon of Twitch getting into Chess during 2020, the \"rebirth\" of Minecraft popularity, GTA RP, etc.) never really collaborated with the established members of any speedrunning community. The closest we ever got was the popularity of \"Getting Over It\" with many content creators viewing and reacting to world records for content, and a more recent example, the sudden popularity of GeoGuessr. RAINBOLT essentially became the \"face\" or \"ambassador\", you could say of GeoGuessr \"speedrunning\" to the rest of the content creator community and their viewers, and this was mainly due to his collaborations with Ludwig who is one of the biggest streamers right now.\n\nYet, again, no attention was really given to the rest of the speedrunning communities. Examples include the following:\n\n* Summoning Salt is still currently at 1.5M subscribers despite perhaps pioneering the documentary-style content about speedrunning.\n* GDQ and ESA having a collective subscriber count of just a little over 1 million despite being around for years and are still mostly holding events in relatively small venues\n* NRG Speedrunning dying just shy of its one-year anniversary.\n\nSo many important achievements in speedrunning for the most recognizable games were never really touched on even by the \"gaming journalists\". Like how the Super Mario Bros. community is so close to reaching the \"human limit\"; or how Super Mario 64, a 3D platformer, was completed with 120 stars BLINDFOLDED; or HappyHob successfully doing a SoulsBorneKiro (all Souls games minus Elden Ring) no-hit run, etc.\n\nIt's just sad that even for the most popular games, whether classics or those that are trendy, speedrunning achievements in them never really get the traction that I (and I'm sure many other people) would say that they deserve. Everyone probably knows it exists, but it's just passed on by people to watch the next big esports play or for some \"voice trolling\", \"sus/funny moments\" videos that get rehashed every week. \n\nIt's a tragedy that befalls upon \"niche\" gaming communities like Rocket League, where one of the most unique games with the most talented people around doesn't really get much attention. The weirdest part about speedrunning, though, is that the whole community consists of the subcommunities of literally almost every game ever published and yet is still \"niche\" in terms of popularity relative to other gaming-related interests. \n\nI'm not really sure what it would take for speedrunning to blow up and become more respected and appreciated. The biggest games have recorded amazing speedrun achievements while they were still popular, extremely difficult records that even those who have never played the game would understand how amazing they are have been set, but none of them ever really elevated speedrunning to the standing that it deserves. \n\nIn any case, I'm looking forward to the future of speedrunning, even if it doesn't really grow in popularity. History will continue to be made either way, and who knows? Maybe the next record will finally be the talk of the town. To all you speedrunners out there, both aspiring and established, good luck and get that world record!",

        "text": "Storytelling:\nGame stories are best told through things happening around you. Instead of characters spewing words for 10 minutes as you keep watching them.\nIf you need a famous actor and motion capture to get a decent narrative then your script fails to make use of the fact you're playing a game.\nYou're character is likely 2nd place to everyone else and doomed to observe until they are allowed to intervene and it returns back to everyone else progressing because you did their work.\nWe had more emotion in old gaming era with simple facial expressions,body language and text boxes \n\nPresenting the game story in cutscenes is not inferior to story presented through gameplay.It is in this case.A story presented through gameplay is better because it utilises the strengths of the medium(art,music,characters,... basically lore) to its advantage.\nSome games present the story with bit of suspicious info where we need to connect the story by our own thoughts and have our own story.These games encourage us to share their own story experience in social media which makes gaming community more active.\nSome forced direct storytelling game stories are best experienced through a youtube video.This is why these games are referred to as movie games.They are games that want to be movies (infact they would be better as movies, they would be able to tell a better story by cutting out the gameplay). And since telling a game's story through cutscenes will never be superior to actually watching a good movie/web series/anime.These types of games are best experienced through youtube.\n\nGame stories are better told through gameplay than cutscenes, as it utilizes the strengths of the medium and encourages player engagement.\n\nStorytelling through gameplay will always be better.because its something that only video games can do, and that gives you a reason to actually play the game rather than watching a cutscene compilation on youtube excluding games which has decision making which affects a change in story/gameplay.\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI noticed some people complaining having a built-in fixed hard difficulty is a bad thing for some games.But it was actually one of the main strength of the game which is treated as bad thing.\n\nI prefer having fixed difficulty for many games irrespective of difficulty either if it is easy or medium or hard difficulty like some games (rockstar games,stardew valley,Mario &amp; zelda games,roguelike games,metroidvania games) \n\nBut it's good to have easy difficulty for games which has more focused storytelling and less on gameplay \n\nIt's good to have fixed difficulty for gameplay focused games but having easy difficulty on gameplay focused games doesn't make any sense because it defeats the purpose of having strong gameplay.\n\nIt's good to have easy,normal,hard for games which has both strong story and gameplay",

        "text": "I love VR, I want VR to succeed, I own VR headsets, and I buy VR games. But I almost never play VR. I get motion sickness (which improves the more I play, but prevents me from wanting to play) and many of the games feel like a chore to set up or play. Even when there's a VR game I want to play I tend to avoid it because of the lack of convenience. A few weeks ago I was talking with someone about VR and starting mentally assembling some things that were occurring to me.\n\nIn the 16 bit era of games platformers were king of the castle. Other genres existed but everyone knew Mario and Sonic. As I recall, people on the playgrounds didn't even refer to these games as platformers - people referred to them as 'regular games' and other genres had different names. JRPGs were 'turn based fighting games.'\n\nWhen the PS1/N64 came out platforming took a bit of a hit. Most platformers didn't feel right to play. Even ones that were competently built (Mario 64) created divisiveness amongst their fans. 3D games just didn't mesh well with the gameplay that had been established up to this point. But then JRPGs exploded. Everyone knew Final Fantasy. Tons of games came out that were full blown JRPGs or at least embraced the concepts of turn based gameplay. It wasn't a new type of gameplay, but it was a type of gameplay that meshed well with 3D. Your movements didn't have to be precise and so you could fully immerse yourself in the graphics of the modern era with gameplay that didn't feel restricted by the controls.\n\nDuring the next era (PS2/X-Box) Halo came out and dual analog sticks became common. FPS games started to take off. Action games started to become more prominent - the perspective of platformers without the frustrations of platforming.\n\nSince then I feel like these established gameplay tropes / genres have sort of just continued on. Graphics get better, but gameplay stays the same because there's been no need to evolve. FPS become more and more prominent, action games become more cinematic, JRPGs bounce all over the place (mechanically speaking), and platformers are not forgotten but rarely as amazing as they once were(Mario Odyssey is BAE).\n\nAnd now companies are trying to make VR a thing. And the gameplay is just... there. It's not an evolution of anything - it's just a new perspective on old gameplay tropes / genres. FPS are popular so let's shove FPS mechanics into VR. It's good, but it doesn't quite fit. It reminds me of trying to play platformers in 3D for the first time back in the PS1 days. You can force the game to match the controls but there's an inherent mismatch that is throwing the entire experience off.\n\nSo, I'm postulating that JRPGs exploded in popularity as a response to the transition from 2D to 3D causing platformers to feel flawed. I’m currently starting to think that FPS games are similar to the platformers in this scenario - they feel flawed in VR, so some other style of gameplay needs to take their place - even though FPS feels like it should be a perfect match for VR.\n\nThree games come to mind that I want to mention real quick because they feel relevant to my thoughts on this transition.\n\nBaten Kaitos (Gamecube) - In this JRPG the player has an in-game presence that is independent of the main character. You’re bonded to the main character and you control the main characters movements and the party’s actions but you are canonically *not* the main character. The story creates a firm divide between the characters and the player. This game has always stuck with me as it did a great job of creating a narrative difference and purpose for the player, though it always felt odd that I still controlled every detail of the party’s actions.\n\nX-Com (PC, Console) - In this turn based tactics game the player takes on the role of the commander of a military organization. These games are, mostly, first person from the perspective of the commander - you don’t control units - you give orders to them. When you move around your base and initiate projects or give orders for research you are not doing these things nor are you ‘controlling’ the actions of NPCs to make them happen - you are giving orders that are followed because you are the commander.\n\nMoss (VR) - In this VR action game the player has an in-game presence that is independent of the main character. You’re bonded to the main character and you control the main characters movements and actions but you are canonically *not* the main character. In addition to controlling the actions of the main character you also interact with the world directly - moving things around and interacting with the environment.\n\nFirst thing I want to do is highlight how similar my descriptions of Baten Kaitos and Moss are. Isn’t this a strange parallel? Both of these games came out at a time where gameplay was evolving and both tried to find ways to tie the players point of view to the evolution in gameplay perspective.\n\nThe second thing I want to do is say that, in my opinion, all three of these games are a better fit for VR than any sort of FPS. These are games that have a first person perspective but ones that take the players physical location into account. Instead of trying to force the player's perspective into places where it doesn't fit, these games are designed to account for that perspective. I suppose you could call these three games third person omniscient?\n\nI’m not trying to say that all VR games need to follow these trends or anything - I’m simply saying that I think there’s an inherent flaw with the way most VR games are currently being designed - they’re trying to follow established trends rather than trying to make gameplay that works for the technology.\n\nCould VR find more success if developers focused on designing games to take advantage of the unique experience that VR provides?",

        "text": "If I was going to ask you the history of how Exosquad for Sega Genesis came out you would think that either it was made by Playmates based on the toy or by Universal Animation Studios based on the TV show. Even though it was based on Universal Animation Studios' animated show, it was mostly made by Playmates due to their license about the runout. See Jeff Siegel was head of Universal Animation Studios and creator of Exosquad with the help from Michael Edens as head writer and showrunner in season two. The show was controversial at best, with the show based in a futuristic Space opera setting talking about racism, horrors of war, losing loved ones in war, with the death of main characters in a Saturday morning cartoon. In season two they kill off about half the main characters as in the Red Wedding EP of Game of Thrones. But after Universal Studios fired Jeff Siegel and Michael Edens they let Playmates do whatever they wanted with the license before it ran out. We ended with Robotech/Exosquad crossover, two odd PC apps, a board game, and finally the Sega Genesis that was supposed to have a SNES release as well but was canceled. And even worst Playmates got Appaloosa Interactive as the developer of the game. Appaloosa Interactive was a Hungarian Company in Hungary. The problem was no one in Hungary knew what an Exosquad was. Working on art and little details that Universal Animation Studios, Appaloosa was forced to make the rest of the game's story up. They picked Time travel. Exosquad animated show came out in 1993 and ended in 94, the game came out in 1995.",

        "text": "I posted something pretty similar the other day, but it was removed for being too much of a rant, plus I have some other ideas I want to discuss with people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy whole life I was either a kid and played pretty much sports games, Minecraft, and Wii games. In more recent years I've been playing more **real** games. Your Sony, CDPR, Bethesda, Ubisoft, etc, and have always struggled to finish games. I really struggle to get past \\~15 hours. Games like GTAV, RDR2, Assassins Creed, Control, Half-Life, and even Portal 1/2. These are all games I will play half of then get bored and stop playing. I blame it partially on things like Madden, 2K, COD, and other such games for making me expect a constant SOMETHING, but I also kinda blame it on those games not being for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't seen it in a while, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvJPKOLDSos&amp;ab_channel=NakeyJakey) video by [NakeyJakey](https://www.youtube.com/@NakeyJakey) kinda sums up my thoughts on RDR2, and Rockstar as a whole. I don't like the wonderfully detailed open world, with such a linear story. Watch the video, not only because it just really good, but because it details my thoughts. Or, look at pretty much all Ubisoft games. They are the same. Sure, they often have cool characters and pretty worlds, but the gameplay loop is the same. It's boring. For the other games, I really think it's me being impatient but I felt it important to mention it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my friend first made me play Fallout New Vegas, all I could see were the graphics. In the past, I've played these games like rdr2, gtav, and assassins creed, these beautiful games. New vegas was UGLY but it was freeing. Yeah, I could go pretty much anywhere in assassins creed but why? There was really no reason to be there. Whereas in fnv there was stuff to do and stuff to find. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then played the other fallout games, then went to elder scrolls. I loved them all the same, tho some more than others. And really, few games have been able to make me feel the same. The only ones that I can recall are GOW4, Cyberpunk, Elden Ring, and Death Stranding, which is my favorite game ever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut back to Bethesda, I love how real these games feel. Like for example in Skyrim, I can have 100 cabbages in my inventory, and then drop them and see all 100. In something like GTA or TW3 I can't. I know a game like RDR2 may technically have better npc's, but something about them in TES or Fallout just feels more real. Maybe it's that I can go into their homes, trade with them, talk to them. But I really don't know. Or looking at something like assassins creed, or sadly CP2077, is how you interact with the world. It's really only through missions. In Skyrim, I can find and run a farm. In new vegas, I can &gt;!kill Mr house, and Caeser, and then just finish easily with the NCR.!&lt; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd modding, I know so many people cannot play without mods, but to me, they just enhance the experience. These just expand the life of the games dramatically. The fact that I could go into Skyrim for the 900th time and have a completely unique experience is awesome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know how to end this, so Ill end it here. Bethesda is the only dev I've found where I dont dislike any of their major releases. I even like aspects of FO76, though I still do not understand why they didnt just make another mainline fallout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to also hear other people's thoughts on this. Maybe someone with better wordplay and understanding of the games can maybe help me pinpoint things? Or if anyone knows of any games similar to them. One I hear a lot is BOTW, which I plan on playing soon. Are there any other like-minded people? Please! I want to discuss it!!",

        "text": "Hello   fellow Redditors. In case you did not know, NordVPN has a free product   called Meshnet, this feature can help improve your gaming experience   with you fellow friends while playing various multiplayer games. In   general, Meshnet allows it’s users to form encrypted remote networks and   turn compatible private devices into VPN endpoints for themselves and   their friends. The best part it that Meshnet can be used as a stand   alone product, you don’t need NordVPN subscription to use it and it's   totally free!\n\nHere are a few key use cases of Meshnet that can help elevate your gaming with your friends:\n\n* **Throw a remote LAN party with your friends** \\-   When Meshnet forms an encrypted private network, the devices on that   network will treat each other much like they would if they were all on   the same WiFi network. This can make it easier to host uninterrupted   private LAN parties on video games that support this function. No more   complaints about random disconnections while playing with friends!\n* **Host a server for your friends** \\-   user could connect their own server to the network and use it as a LAN   hosting platform for their friends. Users can connect 10 of their own   devices and link to up to 50 other devices in a Meshnet, so you could   potentially form a large private community around your own server;\n* **Share IP addresses** \\-   compatible devices can be used by Meshnet as VPN endpoints. This  allows  you to use the same IP address that your friend uses,  potentially  granting access to servers or features that you could not  have accessed  otherwise.\n\nHope this helps someone, happy gaming!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11quc9q/wondering_about_games_of_skill_and_of_explicit/",
        "text": "Something I've thought about here &amp; there is the overlap &amp; differences between games of skill, and games of explicit progression, especially given the increasing adoption of the latter by the former.\n\nTo be clear, when I say games of skill, what I have in mind isn't necessarily twitch-based games, but games as different as Tetris &amp; Street Fighter. Those where there's generally no explicit progression system whatsoever, and you can definitely tell the difference between a beginner and someone that's spent time mastering the game. \n\nThis is contrasted somewhat with games of explicit progression, where skill is still present albeit in arguably lesser ways. That is, depending on the game, even if you *know* an enemy's weakness, you may still have to increase your level or stats enough for you to survive long enough or for it to deal enough damage to overcome them. In short, explicit progression here means any upfront system of progression/unlocks, whether classic leveling systems, ability/perk unlocks, etc.\n\nHowever, there's then the overlap as noted, which I recognize has been throughout games with explicit progression all the while, but has shifted lately as more skills-based games adopt explicit progression in one form or another, whether tacking on leveling systems to unlock perks or gear or whatever, or battle passes to unlock a variety of things to engender a sense of progression.\\* \n\n\\*-I know this may border more on the side of discussing explicit reward systems by mentioning battle passes, but from what I can tell, some games lately seem to blur those lines themselves. Feel free to disregard their mention here if it helps, or if I've misunderstood how they're being used.\n\nWhat I've been thinking about isn't so much the basic why here, as I'm familiar with some of the basic reasons (they can monetize it, it keeps people playing, ppl like numbers going up &amp; allotted rewards, etc.), but also just what people's preferences are in this regard. Do you prefer the two mixed together, &amp; if so, in what ways? \n\nIf you prefer them separate, so a game of skill's only progression is personally improving at it, does the game itself give you feedback to indicate that (e.g. clearing something with a S-rank), or is it something you track for yourself &amp; do you like setting your own goals more? \n\nIf the other side of this, a game with limited skill &amp; primarily built around explicit progression, is it for the accessibility (i.e. not having to basically train to play the game well), and/or preferring a more explicit structure to help guide your play?",

        "text": "To demonstrate this point, I will use The Outer Worlds as an example.\n\nOn paper, I should love the Outer Worlds. I was always a huge fan of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and the Outer Worlds basically does everything those games do. I'm also a huge fan of the Mass Effect trilogy and space in general. Take the Fallout 3 / NV formula and apply it to a space setting. That game should be right up my alley. But in the case of the Outer Worlds, it just isn't. It's boring as all hell. \n\nA lot of action RPG fans are always complaining about games not having enough choices and consequences, not having enough opportunities to actually \"role play.\" Well, the Outer Worlds does offer those things. There are so many different ways you can make your character; good or evil, smart or stupid, charismatic or not, honest or a liar, you name it. There are also a ton of different decisions you can make throughout the game that have consequences on the world around you. \n\nNonetheless, the game is still boring as hell. What it lacks is a reason to give a damn. The art direction and style is mediocre at best. While the game does have some cool looking sky boxes, the overall aesthetic of the world is just this ugly retro future style that is trying too hard to be like Fallout. The setting in general just isn't interesting. The characters are bland. Everything revolves around a simplistic message of \"corporations bad.\" The story is not engaging. Half the time you are playing the game is just listening to dialogue, which normally I'd be Ok with, but I just don't care what any of these characters have to say. \n\nNot only that, but the gameplay in general sucks. The combat is boring, the loot grind is boring, the constant listening to NPC ramble on forever is boring. \n\nThe overall point I am making is that even though this game offers what many RPG fans view as the holy features; role playing, choices, consequences, all that jazz, it doesn't even matter. In actuality, things are not something that can make or break a game. The most important thing is getting immersed in the world. After that comes gameplay, story, and characters. Variety of role-playing options, choices, consequences, etc. are complete afterthoughts.",

Games that we either ended up completing in a single sitting, or otherwise if life had not forced interruptions, *would* have found ourselves doing so.\n\nPlease include why in your responses.\n\nI've had a few titles that fit this over the years. God of War 2, Uncharted 4, the Unfinished Swan, Exo One... but for myself, it has to be \"The Witness\", a line-based puzzle game (by dame dev behind \"Braid\") which remains my favourite game to this day. Despite it being a puzzle game, I've replayed it several times.\n\nI actually played the game my first time on mobile, and I got it simply because I was bored in between college classes and needed something to play on my phone. This game was on sale, and I liked that it was a port from what I considered a \"full console game\", so I tried it just hoping it would pass the time.\n\nWhile I ended up playing the game over several short sessions in between my classes, I assure you that if I could have completed it in one push, I probably would have. I was *marveled* by this game.\n\nFirst, the music-less sound design was inviting, yet mysterious. The lack of narrative, but clear indication of a thought-out world was enticing. The satisfaction of solving each progressive puzzle and learning new puzzle methods allowing me to return to old areas to access hidden secrets was rewarding.\n\nI could go on and on about all I valued from this game, one that I merely expected to \"meh\"-level enjoy. Simply put, it surprised me and I *couldn't put it down*. To this day \"Anitra's Dance\" is now my favourite classical piece because of this game (if you've played *all* of it, you'll know why).\n\nYears later I did a paper on the use of gaming as intrinsic motivation for learning, and used The Witness to demonstrate the concept of literacy. As throughout the game you're learning a new written language. By game's end you've gained fluency in an entirely new coded set of iconography of your own volition...that's no small feat, from an education perspective.\n\n\n\nSo, what about for you? What game just got it's claws into you shortly into playing, and you couldn't put down?",

Games that we either ended up completing in a single sitting, or otherwise if life had not forced interruptions, *would* have found ourselves doing so.\n\nPlease include why in your responses.\n\n\n---\n\n\nFor myself I've had several instances of this ..\n\n(1) in my youth, at a sleepover at a relative's house during summer break, I played - and completed - God of War 2, in a single unbroken session. I'm not sure why, but I remember just loving each and every encounter. I was always thinking \"next challenge, next challenge\". Then when I got to the credits, I felt an odd, surprising, sense of accomplishment.  Never anticipated beating the game ever, nevermind in a single push.\n\n(2) at some point in college I sat down to play Uncharted 4. This game's story and performance kept me hooked, and other than a short lunch break midday, I played from early morning until evening having completed the game in one go. I am a sucker for a good story, and I'm not evaluating the quality of U4's story, but for my experience it was a damn fun time.\n\n(3) as an adult I've only recently had a few games that *hooked* me in similar ways:\n(a) \"The Witness\"...while I didn't do this in one go, I *would* have, if life didn't pull me away. I could not get enough of this game. I felt like I was learning some new language - and in a way I was! What a treat, one I've replayed again and again, despite being a puzzle game.\n(b) \"Exo One\" was a \"meh, I'll try it\" kind of game on Xbox Game Pass, and I ended up an entire evening to playing through the game. I was amazed at how a simple set of traversal mechanics (and really, only one mechanic) could be so addicting. This title succeeded in motivating me to always get higher and higher, despite there being no extrinsic reward for doing so.\n(c) \"The Unfinished Swan\". This is the game I show people when I want to convince them games can be art. Not because it's overly pretty, or tells an abstract narrative...but simply from a gameplay persoective. The concept of gameplay is simple enough: you're in an entirely white-suffused world and have to shoot black gobs of paint to reveal the surrounding environment. Along the way there's a charming story to tell, and more experiments with tone and contrast which were a joy to experience.\n\n\nThere are more, I'm sure, but these are the ones that came to mind.\n\nWhat about you?",

        "text": "I know this game has been beaten and dragged so many times at this point and i won't add anything too original to the discourse at all. I only had the pleasure to play Duke Nukem 3D and it's expansion packs during the 2020 quarantine when i had nothing better to do and was getting into the old school FPS genre of games or Boomer Shooters as some might call them. And even though i don't have the nostalgia goggles for 3D like some other people here may have since i am too young to have grown up in that era i had an absolute blast. 3D, while not the best FPS i've ever played is by far the most fun. Powerful weapons, great graphics for the time, a badass protagonist, not nearly as offensive as people who played it hyped it up to be and absolutely IMMACULATE level design. Seriously the level escalation in 3D is absolutely fucking sublime one of the best i've ever seen in an FPS game. \n\nIt is precisely because of my love for 3D that i find Forever beyond fascinating in a \"staring at a car crash as it's happening\" kind of way. I've never see a sequel miss the point this badly. Usually sequels suffer from feeling too much like the first game however Forever has the complete opposite problem. This game is so fundamentally wrong i genuinely believe it can be studied in game development class as to what NOT to do when making a sequel. It's downright science i tell you. There's 3 fundamentals here that absolutely get butchered in Forever in a spectacular way:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Weapons:\n\nThis might be a bit of a nitpick but it really personally bothered me. In 3D the weapons, while not anything spectacular or interesting (Shrinker excluded) they were punchy as hell. From the first pistol to the rocket launcher every single weapon feels nice, weighty and satisfying to shoot. Forever on the other hand feels...i don't know it just feels off. Like none of the weapons feel powerful at all. The Ripper especially suffers here. What was once an absolute workhorse weapon next to the shotgun in 3D is an absolute joke. It doesn't do a lot of damage, it sounds awful and ammo isn't even that plentiful for it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. The level design:\n\n The level design in 3D is some of the best i've seen in any FPS game i've played and it was precisely it that kept me going cause i wanted to see what other locations they managed to squeeze into this rather primitive engine. The levels are huge yet linear. They leave room for exploration yet you'll rarely ever get lost in them (Something which a lot of FPS games of that time did not do well) it's just great. Then cut to Forever and it's just linear all the way through. There's no key hunting, there's no exploration, it's just linear shooting gallery after linear shooting gallery and it's so FUCKING BORING. How do you so fundamentally fuck up such a large and important part of what made the original game so likeable in the first place is downright impressive\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Duke Himself:\n\nThis, above all else, is my biggest sticking point that i haven't seen a lot of people bring attention to when they talk about this game and how it compares to 3D. Now i'm not gonna act like Duke in 3D is some holier than thou boyscout or anything like that but what he is is a likeable, if a bit crass meathead who, at the end of the day, still wants to save the world. He loves the glory that comes with it but that's secondary to him. He goes beyond the call of duty to save the planet and the kidnapped women, of course he's gonna be a bit of an egomaniac. This is all compounded by the fact that he's never once disrespectful to any of the female NPC's / Strippers in the game. Before playing 3D i heard people describe Duke Nukem as this sexist pig who only cares about getting his dick wet and how offensive and degrading the franchise is towards women and i just don't see that in 3D. He never insults the strippers and hookers in the game, he actively saves multiple women in the game from being killed by the aliens (hell the game actively punishes you if you kill any of the trapped women) and from what i've seen from the PS1 sequels he has no problem working alongside women to fight the aliens. Sure, like every single female NPC in 3D is either a stripper hooker but Duke himself isn't the one degrading them for it at all. \n\nThe Duke in Forever on the other hand is what i feel the forums complained about. Forever is so gross and disgusting in it's potrayal of women that even someone like me who has relatively thick skin was grossed out by it. That section in the alien tunnels is gonna haunt me for the rest of my live. It's like the developers thought to themselves \"Hey there's nudity and sexy women in 3D so let's just double down on it with alien rape fetish\" Absolutely fucking vile. Oh and they turned Duke from a loveable meathead to a straight up jock asshole who doesn't care about anybody but himself too. Just...fuck off Randy, fuck off",

        "text": "While I haven't played the first game in a long time, and I skipped the second game entirely (might go back and check it out some day), I've been playing Dragon Age Inquisition recently, and something occurred to me.\n\nIn my memories of the first game, there is a heavy emphasis placed on followers of The Maker simply having faith in its existence, apparently having little knowledge of what The Maker specifically is, what it specifically does, or why.\n\nI fully accepted this, as it was refreshing to have a game approach religion in a way more akin to real religion. I enjoy how the fantasy genre is traditionally populated with a pantheon of crazy gods similar to Greek or Norse mythology, but the approach to religion in the first DA just had a more dignified feel for me.\n\nHowever, a few of the random follower discussions in DAI seem to shed some light on the subject, at least more than I expected. In particular there are two discussions that got my mind working.\n\nIn one, Solas describes how he views templar and seeker powers (I believe he is referring to both, but it could be specifically seeker powers). He essentially says they reinforce reality as it is, preventing reality-altering magic from manifesting in a specific area.\n\nIn the other, Cole is talking about where Templar power comes from, and speaks of something older than magic that they tap into.\n\nThere are parts of The Chant of Light that tie in as well, things like The Maker letting its creations visit it in their sleep, essentially a series of claims that The Maker resides in The Fade.\n\nI'm sure there's a lot more lore that relates to this idea, but I'm only including things I definitely remember.\n\nIn my opinion, it sounds like The Maker is a spirit of some kind. Following this logic, since each spirit has a specific nature in this setting, that would mean The Maker also has a specific nature. \n\nIt is clear in DAI that both templars and seekers can use their powers for evil if they so choose. Nothing about their abilities changes when they do things that The Chantry considers blasphemous, no matter how depraved, other than red templars actually being stronger than normal templars.\n\nThis means that whatever The Maker's nature is, it doesn't care for the beings of this world in the same way as they tend to imagine. Spirits don't think or feel in the way mortals do in this setting, so it follows that The Maker would have an alien mind, but there are multiple examples of spirits caring about mortals (specifically the behavior and wellbeing of mortals, the two things The Maker is supposed to care about more than any other being), so this is an important clue about The Maker's true nature.\n\nI think The Maker is a spirit of existence. If it is older than magic, and reinforces reality, then it follows that  it created the material world, but why? Perhaps just because that is its nature, to make things exist in a specific way (the mundane way of our world, it would seem). \n\nIt is supposedly the parent of all mortal life, and may even be the force that holds up the continued existence of the physical universe, so it also makes sense that people would generally view it as a benevolent force to be worshipped, regardless of how it directly interacts with mortals.\n\nJust my personal theory, but I found it interesting to contemplate the nature of The Maker since it was such a mystery in the first game",

Dlc in those as well. Or how about locking the ending to your story in a 40 dollar dlc? Looking at you ubisoft.

Games even refer to themselves as “experiences” instead of games. Detroit become human calls itself “the detroit experience.” As if it’s not just a video game. I liked this when it was new, but i am missing games that were just that. Games. A simple shooter, a simple beat em up, a game where you play as a cheerleader and you kill zombies with a chainsaw.

Let your customers wait extra long just because they can’t afford a current gen console or a good enough pc. \n\nThis only goes to show that your game will NOT run well on old consoles. Think of drops in fps, way longer loading times, inferior graphics, fewer npc’s just to make the game playable on older hardware. And what you’re left with is an inferior copy of the game that players are still expected to pay full price for. \n\nYou make them wait way longer than the pc and current gen people, for an inferior copy of your game. Delays can be good, you might say. It’s better to wait extra long than to receive a buggy game. Well, my dear reader, I wholeheartedly disagree in this scenario. You release your game for pc and current consoles, expect old gen and switch players to just avoid spoilers for months without end, then charge them full price for an obviously inferior copy of your game, I personally do not accept such practices. \n\nThey should offer some kind of deal to these unfortunate souls, to make up for these unacceptable practices. A good discount for one, or the pre order/deluxe edition items for free. That would make this situation a bit more acceptable. But will they do this? No probably not. “They owe you nothing.” Is what I have heard before when last this game was delayed. If you are of this opinion, then know that you are wrong. They most certainly do owe us something to make up for these unacceptable waiting times, especially seeing as we were promised “three days early access” to the game if we pre ordered, which we obviously also did not receive. \n\nI believe that I, and my fellow unfortunate souls, have a right to be pissed and bitter. And unless such a deal is actually offered to us, I for one will not be purchasing this game anymore. I for one am done with being disappointed every time the “new” release date draws near, just for them push it back by yet another month.",

        "text": "Let's take for example Pokémon (that's the main turn-based RPG I used to play).\n\nJust a disclaimer: this post may seem like I'm just bashing Pokémon all the time. I actually like Pokémon, I just think its combat is one of its weakest points.\n\nMost of the times, in Pokémon, for the average player, combat isn't really that thoughtful. A lot of the times, it consists in spamming the same move until you run out of PP or until you have to heal your Pokémon.\n\nEven in competitive Pokémon, even if combat is more interesting, a considerable part of the depth isn't in the battles themselves; instead, it's in party composition and Pokémon training and breeding.\n\nBecause of the lack of depth in combat, I had always thought turn-based RPG-style combat (I'm not talking about tactics games with positioning) sucked.\n\nRecently, though, after playing Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, and taking a look at Brutal Orchestra, I have now changed my mind. Turn based combat can be fantastic if done right.\n\nI hope more turn-based RPGs take inspiration and try to keep in mind the following 3 points.\n\n# 1. Decisions and Resource/Risk Management\n\nA combat system where there's no risk or no cost to use a strong move is just boring. Why would you ever use a weaker move if your stronger one is always there?\n\nIn Pokémon, the only moves you have to worry about are the ones with 5 PP. Moves with 10 PP or more are enough to last the whole battle, or maybe the whole gym, so why not spam them?\n\nIn Slay the Spire, you have a limit of energy you can use each turn, so you have to think about what you'll do on each turn. In Brutal Orchestra, the pigment system is a whole next level of depth in terms of resource management.\n\nEvery turn in these games, you have to make decisions, which is the heart of what makes turn-based games fun. In real-time games, you can afford to make a simple game with no decisions and still be a fun game, since you also have to use your reflexes. In turn-based games, having interesting decisions is essential.\n\n# 2. Interesting RNG vs. boring RNG\n\nPokémon has some of the worst types of RNG, which are critical hits and hit/miss. It just makes you feel bad when you receive a critical hit or when you miss an attack, but it doesn't lead you to make interesting decisions.\n\nGames like Dicey Dungeons and Slay the Spire rely heavily on a better form of RNG: they give you a hand of cards or dice, then you have to make decisions based on that. The RNG is there to make different scenarios so each turn has different possibilities available to you.\n\nImagine how boring StS would be if every turn had the same 4 cards available to you?\n\n# 3. Boring moves\n\nThere are just 4 moves for each Pokémon, and they don't have a lot of variety: most moves consist only of either damage and/or a simple stat buff or debuff. Few moves are actually unique in a way you can make a very cool build. For obvious reasons, this makes games more bland.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11pp019/the_boss_in_games_must_challenge/",
        "text": "The boss at the end is a long-standing gaming tradition that occurs in almost all genres. These complex and unique opponents can be remembered for a long time and even force you to play a game that has already been played for a long time. Or they may not be remembered at all, causing only irritation and relief that the fight has finally ended.\n\n**The boss must challenge**\n\nA well-thought-out boss arranges a real test of the player's skills - throws him a challenge that will be remembered for a long time. The main secret here is that this challenge should not depend on the abilities of the boss, but on the skills of the player.\n\nDevelopers should think through the battle taking into account what the player already knows how to do. Other mechanics are important here, and pumped open skills, and even inventory, if it is used in battle. If this is neglected, it may turn out that the player is either unable to resist the boss, or, conversely, wins too easily.\n\n&gt;If the player is able to switch and dodge attacks, then the boss can challenge this particular mechanic, and attack, for example, with jerks, attacks on the terrain or in an arc. So the boss will force the player to constantly move. And you can come up with a lot of similar calls! But when the bosses in the game are the same type of test, it's not very good.\n\nTo make the challenge fair, game designers leave hints for the player. They help you navigate during the battle and understand the idea of a particular battle. The most obvious clue is a brightly glowing dot on the boss model. A red eye, a swollen abscess and other prominent elements indicate where and how best to hit. But the hints are not limited to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The boss, along with possible attacks, techniques and other actions, should be clear to the player. After all, a fight is, in fact, a dialogue that the player must understand so that frustration does not arise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For example, when the boss raises the sword, the player must understand what he is going to attack, as well as where and from where the blow will be struck. And if the opponent froze and began to pulse red, then this is a signal to which the player must react.\n\nA good boss must obey certain rules. For example, leaving the player an opportunity to attack is the so-called window (window of opportunity). If the player manages to dodge a bunch of punches or abilities, the boss opens and gives the opportunity to counterattack. This window acts as a reward for the player. However, even it does not last forever - after some time, the boss can jump back, strike back or react in some other way.\n\nSuch combinations of actions are set by combat designers. They set patterns, determine how the boss moves, reacts to the player's actions, what conditions he obeys and what combinations of attacks he uses. And so that the player does not memorize the given series of consecutive patterns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The boss uses techniques from his arsenal based on several checks - his logic checks where the player is, how much health he has, and so on. There are a lot of such conditions that can be prescribed. If the boss has them well thought out and implemented, then his actions begin to act not on a mindless shuffle of all abilities, but on a clear plan.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The boss may even break some rules, but within certain limits. For example, he can do things that ordinary opponents in the game cannot do - apply new effects, use mechanics. He should gently \"break\" the mechanics, bend it, while not forgetting about the player's capabilities.\n\nPhasing can even be a distinctive feature of the boss - it is a system of changing the behavior of the boss, in which he can change tactics, attacks and appearance several times during a fight. At the same time, he does not become a radically different opponent, but offers a different approach and throws a new challenge.\n\nThe standard number of phases is two or three. You can do more, but then it will be more difficult for the player to navigate in battle. The player's understanding of the boss in the phase is still important, so the change of phases is usually done visually - they are often tied to the level of health and are accompanied by a transitional stage.\n\nExperimenting with boss mechanics can be useful, but it should be done with caution. Any radical change in the gameplay challenges the player - in the case of bosses, it is important to make sure that this challenge is adequate. For example, Ornstein and Smaug from the first Dark Souls can be considered a successful experiment.\n\nDouble and triple bosses are always a risk. To do this, you need to use additional logic, and players need to simultaneously move and memorize patterns by attacking opponents. But these two bosses were able to find a balance and provide a challenge for the player. At the same time, they also reveal their own unique mechanics - for example, unusual phasing, which takes into account which of the two will be the first.",

        "text": "I have replayed Fallouts 3 and New Vegas to death, even going so far as to complete Very Hard/Survival runs and a deathless run on New Vegas. The plots have stuck with me for years now, and I consistently remember little secrets from either game. By any definition, these are two of my favorite games of all time.\n\n**Enter Fallout 4.** \n\nI have completed it, technically, but I barely remember much of the game. I remember the major plot beats but not much beyond that. Every time I try to replay it, I get about 10 hours in and drop it. I have been trying to figure out why. *What about the earlier games attracts me that Fallout 4 doesn't have?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Player Character Talks?**\n\nI don't want to rehash old arguments, so I just want to quickly mention this one. Because of the voiced lines and four-button selection, he PC's lines are short and almost always a generic variation of \"yes\" or \"no.\" Compared to F3 and NV, F4's PC feels lobotomized. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Poor Early-Game Characters?**\n\nI wonder if Preston came on a little too strong at the beginning of F4 with respect to the minutemen quests. There are almost no real characters to speak of in the first 5-15 hours of F4 because many players likely found themselves doing minutemen stuff or generally just exploring before advancing to Diamond City (where the really strong characters are). \n\nConversely, F3 and NV immediately expose you to a deluge of engaging characters (Moriarty, Moira Brown, Burke, Sunny Smiles, Doc Mitchel, Benny, etc) and mini-factions (the Family, Powder Gangers, NCR, etc) all within the first 5 hours. Most of these characters have very little depth, but there's so many that you don't need a lot of depth. F4 put all of its early-game eggs in the Preston basket, which really sucks given the community's disdain for him. He just can't carry solo. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Weapons?**\n\nF4 introduced pipe weapons. It's not hard to see the appeal: highly customizable weapons that can fulfill virtually any role. The problem is that, at least early on, the player *only* encounters pipe weapons on enemies. The result is a very same-y set of weapons the player uses for a while. F4 made pipe weapons the default (i.e. what you use barring anything else).\n\n* The player quickly becomes inundated with 10mm and .32 ammo. This makes automatic weapons using these ammo types the most obvious go-to.\n* The loot-and-shoot cycle becomes a little boring because the player *only* encounters pipe weapons early on. \n\nF3 and NV made weapons feel special, especially in the early game, because of the weapon condition and ammo limits. Both games had their \"defaults,\" but they also drip-fed interesting weapons at a steady rate. In other words, the player was expected to cycle through a variety of weapons, each with their own unique model and operation. Resource management played a crucial role, and gunning a mutant down with the new hotness felt both satisfying and tactical in the early game. F4 doesn't have this because everyone carries damn pipe weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Boston Black Hole?**\n\nBoston in F4 is gorgeous and jam-packed with content. However, I could not tell you much about the rest of the wasteland. Bethesda poured so much in Boston's content that the rest of the Commonwealth feels spare and uninteresting. This may explain why wasteland exploration feels more like a chore than a treat. \n\nF3 (and Skyrim), imo, is the pinnacle of \"go anywhere and find something cool.\" NV didn't hit exactly the same. Instead, its content is concentrated among the slew of subfactions, New Vegas itself, the NCR camps, the Hill, etc. The two early games felt like a *world* as opposed to a monumental city-state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Factions?**\n\nF4's brotherhood is easily the best iteration in the series. It maintains the same grit as NV and past games while also carrying F3's bombast forward. Not only are they cool. The BH has a rich lore, interesting characters, and motivations that may not be entirely virtuous. A good, crunchy faction made for a Fallout game.\n\nI cannot say the same for the rest of the factions. The Minutemen could have worked, but Preston's writing just doesn't feel like it fits a Fallout game. They feel like Saturday-morning heroes as opposed to an upstart faction in a hostile world. The Institute *is* an interesting premise but not much is done with them. They barely interact with the Commonwealth outside of harassing it. They're long-term motivations aren't clear. Though, I suppose every Fallout has its hard-to-justify \"evil\" faction. The Railroad feels like a subfaction that got elevated to \"full\" faction status due to dev constraints. \n\nTo be fair, F3 isn't much better here. What I *can* say is that the plot and character motivations are immediately engaging and understandable. It turns out that a water purifier is pretty damn important in a post-apocalypse.",

This one thing extended my playtime by dozens of hours, and taking the perk was entirely optional.\n\nIf I am finishing the game and I have already spent a lot of time exploring the world for side quests and stuff, I will probably not go back to exploring it again once I finish the \"main story\". Because that would mean going back to the same zones and checking every little corner, like a maniac, just to be sure that I have not missed anything. I don't see much fun in that. I will either drop the game or keep playing, if you only tell me what I have missed.\n\nSomeone spent time adding that stuff to the game, there are cool areas or little stories left behind because I did not see that one little door on a 2000km2 map, and I think that's sad.\n\nI really get it that the whole point of \"exploration\" is, well, exploring, and it is the most rewarding when you discover something on your own. But why not offer the player - maybe after finishing the game or reaching max level - to obtain this optional super-skill that gives you the location of everything you have missed (areas, side quests, important NPCs, notes, perhaps collectibles)? True explorers may skip it, the rest can take it and have fun.\n\nOne reason for not adding that I can think of are achievements or those trophies that you have on consoles. But you could always make it not count towards achievements. And either way, the Internet is full of guides on obtaining everything for every game so those things seem redundant to me. Another reason could be that full reveal might not work well in certain games: for instance, I think Hogwart's Legacy could really benefit from it, but Dark Souls lose a lot.",

You find out what an NPC likes, grind some parameters, complete NPC's quest - you get something out of this. New party member, free items, access to things, or, well, other type of a reward. And once you achieve that... it ends. Your character doesn't actually have any relationship beyond receiving the reward. In real life though it's a pathological behavior. \n\nYou don't date someone for ulterior benefits. You don't get interested in a girl because \"she's a dentist, so I'll have free dental cleaning\". You don't date a guy because \"he's rich, so he'll buy me stuff\"... ok, that happens, but shouldn't. You date someone because **you just like spending time with them**.

I think it's mostly the freedom you're given, as well as how real everything feels. Like for example in skyrim I can have 100 cabages in my invintory, and then drop them and see all 100. Whereas in a game like GTA or TW3 I wouldn't be able to.  Or how I can go into any building, something I can't do in gta. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are few games that have been able to match my levels of immersion, interest, and enjoyment that I expernice when playing something like fallout and elder scrolls. The only games that have been able to match/beat these things is GOW 2018 an Death Stranding (which is my goat game lol). I'm sure there are other games out there that I would love but not to this extent. I can go talk to someone random and now I am being sent across the map to clear out a cave or a vault or a town which then leads me on hours of gameplay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso modding. I know it might be a crutch for fans to fix their games, but you can get so much more value out of the game buy adding a few (hundered) mods. It also helps the games stay relevant for much longer. I mean look at Beyond Skyrim or the FO3 and FNV remake games in FO4. I mean right now, as I write this, I am modding fo4 again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really have trouble explaining why I love things, this being no different.

        "text": "Video game achievements have a history of almost two decades. Originated on seventh generation consoles, they took over the entire gaming industry to a crazy extent. You could complete a very hard task, and all you got wasn't even a shirt, but an achievement. **It's understood: achievements originated as a social thing to show off before your friends - and so far they remain the same.** However, I personally think that this approach should undergo some rework. \n\n# The problem\n\nIn the most of the games, achievements indicate the progress you reached in a game. They're given for completing certain levels, missions, unlocking certain abilities and tools. This approach is understood in the most of the games because they're, despite some being really great, \"one and done\". \n\n**However, there are some games where you can get certain achievements accidentally, should it be a bug or mod testing.** Yes, I'm talking mostly about Bethesda Game Studios games: Skyrim, Fallout 4, Starfield in the future. People spend dozens of hours modding these games and testing several aspects of these mods. Sometimes, they can accidentally get an achievement they didn't earn.\n\nAlso, some games offer you big customization options and built around rising from zero to hero - and each time, it is a unique adventure. Of course, these games are played over and over again. **So why some previous playthroughs deserved an achievement while new, more experienced ones, don't?** Okay, it also goes to some more linear games - even in this case, some players would still like to start not just new, but fresh adventure, play a game like the first time. \n\nFinally, there is a social thing about it. Achievements appeared in 00's, which was a different time. Internet wasn't everywhere, we were not interconnected and available 24/7 - and this is why social features in video games walked hand to hand with people's interest of being online. Now, we just don't need it: it seems like it's more comfortable to have up to 30 most important \"friends\" in social networks and post lesser. **In these conditions, social importance of achievements drained quite well.** \n\n# The solution\n\nUnfortunately, currently there are no official tools to clear your achievements. The only service where you can manage your achievements is Steam, but to do this, you should use a side program which isn't harmful (unless it's Valve games you use it on), but still not really recommended. ~~Origin and Uplay~~ EA App and Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games Launcher, GOG and of course console services - all of that doesn't have this feature even in this unofficial way. \n\nThis is why I think that it's important to give players at least some or completely full control over their achievements. There are two options:\n\n* **Two achievements trackers: global and current.** A service tracks all achievements player gets along their playthrough and remembers them as usual. However, a service also offers player to hide some of their achievements both from community and even from themselves to have this nice pop-up again. This approach will be more suitable for console services due to their \"closed\" nature. \n* **Permanent deletion.** You decide to delete some achievements - you delete them away from your profile. The only way to get them back - unlock them in the game again. The most fair, but harsh option. This will suit Steam more.\n\nAlso, there are obviously variations for these approaches - as well as the fact that they don't really contradict each other. \n\nFinally, to have completely full control over your achievements, you should be able to also activate them, right? However, what about the community you're gonna \"lie\" to? Well, in case you activate an achievement you didn't deserve (or did, but deleted it permanently), there should also be a notice near \"unlock\" time that you used a manager to unlock this one. Technically, to get rid of it, you must permanently delete this achievement (as well as this notice) and actually achieve it in the game itself. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nAchievements is an awesome feature, but since they're often indicating your progress in a game, it would be nice if they applied to every playthrough, not only to original one. Some, or maybe many, especially young, people don't really care about their friends seeing their progress or not, but would like to achieve some stuff again in a new adventure. Sometimes, achievements are achieved wrongly because of bugs or during testing. **This is why players should have from any to full control over achievements they get.**",

But when I see things like hair or weapons clipping through body or clothes in a serious, important or emotional cutscene in AAA games with extremely good graphics, story and voice acting.. It's so distracting and immersion breaking. Why make everything else perfect then have an easily avoidable obvious awkward clipping in a pre animated cutscene? I hate that such simple things stick out like a sore thumb and remind me I'm playing a game despite the 4k textures, sophisticated lighting and all the unnecessary but amazing little details devs put in for the sake of immersion. People always complain about games having \"ps2 graphics\" but you can have perfectly good immersion with any art style as long as it's consistent and artfully done. Sorry if this is nitpicking. I'm sure this is not a big issue for most people.. Just thought it's something that often gets overlooked even though it can be avoided easily.",

        "text": "For those that aren't aware, through the end of March you can get an XBox Series S for $150 through Verizon if you have a Verizon phone or internet subscription. Almost everyone knows someone with a Verizon account, and I'm no different. I've been patient on buying a \"~~next~~ current gen\" console this round because honestly there hasn't been a single title that's made me want to buy a system. Elden Ring is the closest I've come, but I own a gaming laptop and a switch. I travel a lot for my job and I've yet to find a title that's made me want to buy an XBox X/S or PS5.\n\nNow I'm on the fence because at $150 the Series S is a really good deal, and I'm sure once I have one I'll start finding games for it. I'm honestly not sure what I'd play on it right now though. So maybe it would just sit around and it's not worth it. Microsoft's exclusive list doesn't do much for me. I haven't been into FPS for a long time, and I've never been into driving games; the top 3 Microsoft exclusives appear to be Gears, Halo, and Forza.\n\nThe XBox play anywhere thing is really intriguing for me, and honestly that's why I'm making this post. They've got the Bethesda games all on that program. For those that don't know, if you buy a game digitally and it's on the play anywhere list you can play on both your PC through the XBox app and on your XBox without having to pay twice for the same game. Starfield is potentially a game I'd pay full price for when it comes out, especially if I can play it on a few platforms. There are a few low-cost games like Ori that are $5 I'd consider adding to my backlog of games, but nothing big or exciting is jumping out at me.\n\nWhat games are you all playing on XBox right now? Would you all buy a Series S for $150 or is it still a pass for you? Why? For some personal context I travel a fair bit for work and have a gaming laptop and a switch. I've been playing  Subnautica lately. I was playing Fallout 3 before that. Right or wrong I tend to find myself playing a lot of games from years ago for the nostalgia factor, or A-titles a year after launch when they go on sale.",

        "text": "I do not understand the point of pretending things are fixed in a hope to get that fix. You have to face the problem, not ignore it away from existence. It won’t work. Why do people think it doss work? For example, if I point out there is a severe lack of women in gaming then it is always a crowd of people attacking me as if I’m insulting women or something? Getting defensive saying “Women play games too! My wife plays games!” instead of acknowledging the fact that there is a severe lack of women in the gaming community compared to men. Or people will say “There may appear to be a lack, but they are just aren’t vocal.” Maybe even acknowledging that the reason they are not vocal is due to fear of harassment but that they are “totally there.” For one thing, the fear of harassment bit is still something that would desperately need to be addressed but for another thing - WHY LIE? Who doss that help? You know, I know, we all know there is a severe lack of women in most of the gaming community, as well as most nerdy oriented sites. To completely flip it, RateYourMusic is a website for, you guessed it, rating and discussing music. Certainly, you’d think, that the number of men vs women on there must be roughly equal? But you know l better, I hope. It is almost entirely male dominated.\nThen let’s get sticky. Things are turning a bit. There actually is a growing number of women in gaming and on a site like RateYourMusic. Though you may notice that this growing number is predominantly trans women. Which is great, but it begs the question when there are in no time at all more trans women in the gaming community and on RateYourMusic than cis women. The question, “Well if there’s plenty of trans women around, where are the cis women?”\nThe main point that pops to mind is that a trans woman has to come to that point of realization where they know they are a woman and transition, and before that point they may think they are men and society treats them and raises them as men. So it makes a lot of sense that you see way more trans women funneled into gaming and sites like RateYourMusic than cis women because those trans women, likely before ever transitioning, were conditioned by society the same way cis men were. Where as cis women are treated as “girls” from the moment they are born and are led down that path immediately. \nI refuse to believe it is due to biological difference. You’re gonna sit here and tell me cis men biologically want to play video games and cis women don’t? If that’s true then this is truly a disgusting world. But no, I am sure societal molding based on assigned gender is to blame. \nAgain, I’m glad as can be to see an influx of trans women in the gaming community and on places like RateYourMusic. But why can’t I ask the question, “What’s the deal with cis women? Why don’t they BY AND LARGE not partake?”\nAnd I emphasize BY AND LARGE because I know you people will just love to jump in with your “most of my gamer friends are women!!1!” crap. That’s seriously like if I complain about police brutality against black people and you say “Uh no? I have a black cop friend.” Like why do you do this? Can we not just face the issues and discuss them?\nWhat do you think? Do you think cis women are molded by society to not get into video games or nerdier places like RateYourMusic or do you seriously think it is some sort of biological reason? Or are you just gonna be a generic person in denial who thinks they are standing for women by denying the existence of issues for women? \nLet me know, thanks.",

        "text": "I recently watched a few videos, commenting on the supposed downfall of Ubisoft, and one of the games referenced was Farcry 6. Both the video and the comment section had a surprising amount of bashing, so I decided to replay the game. Was it worse than I remember, I thought to myself. No, it's actually way better than I initially thought...\n\nA bit of context: In terms of Farcry, I've only played 4 and 6.\n\nIn terms of other open world games, I've played Zelda: Breath of the wild, Elden Ring, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Grand Theft Auto 5. \n\nFarcry 6 is a massive open world game based in Yara (Cuba), with a focus on FPS gameplay. The main story follows Dani the protagonist, as he helps Libertad lead a rebellion against Anton Castillo, following Anton's installment of slave camps around Yara.\n\nSo far, nothing out of the ordinary. It's an open world game with a plot that makes sense. Where I think this game really shines is the gameplay. The sheer variety and choices you have, constantly allows you to swap both tactics and objectives at your desire.\n\nObviously, there's the story missions, which usually follows the same gameplay as the open world activities except they have cutscenes, dialogue, and bigger budget explosions.\n\nYou got clearing enemy bases, which includes 4 different sizes. The small checkpoints along roads which have spikes that stop cars, anti aircraft sites which which will shoot your plane down unless taken care of before hand, larger areas where enemies reside such as hospitals/hotels/construction zones etc, and then you have the \"Military Targets\" which are larger and much better equipped.\n\nThere are plenty of minigames such as fishing, hunting, dominoes, chicken fights, treasure hunts and races. \n\nSince the games is open world, you have no restriction on how long you can or should remain in any of these activities, and with the amount of weapons at your disposal, there is plenty to experiment with. There is something crazy like 60+ different weapons including unique weapons with lightning and fire. You also got \"standard\" options like snipers, assault rifles, smgs, and shotguns. And of course you got the rocket launchers and crossbows. \n\nYou also get 5 different animals, and RPG style gear that changes your perks depending on what your wearing.\n\nSurely that's it right? Nope. Literally everything mentioned so far has unlockables like skins, attachments and charms. Which adds another layer of customization and freedom. \n\nOkay, but how can we get around in this big open world? Well, I'll tell you. You got horses, cars, helicopters, planes and boats. - all with various options within these categories in terms of both practical use and appearance.\n\nSo what if the story is slightly \"modernized\" with the common cringey joke that attempts to add comic relief? So what if the base formula is still the same since Farcry 3( I wouldn't know I haven't played it)? So what if armor piercing is overpowered? So what if the games if often light hearted? So what if Maximas Matanzas is cringe?\n\nThese are the most common criticism of this game, and I can't say they're wrong. But if you genuinely think this game is a lazy uninspired cash grab trash, then remember that everything I mentioned came in the base game, which can take a hundred hours to beat if you take your time and enjoy what this games has to offer (Not to mention possibly the coolest crossover I've seen with the inclusion of a Strange Things mission).\n\nThis game is a bargain at full price.",

I'm not interested in the discussion of how MMOs have gone awry or stagnated or anything of that sort, those discussions are pretty old hat, but instead I'm interested in the genre they're so often built around, RPGs, and why that is.\n\nI know some other genres have tried to get into the space, e.g. PlanetSide as a MMOFPS, to some success, but to the best of my knowledge, it was RPGs that really pioneered the \"MMO\" genre as such, yet I don't really understand why, or if I may be overlooking other genres that tried something similar-ish but failed.\n\nFor instance, action/adventure games didn't seem to try to lead into this space, despite there arguably being more accessibility for folks, since they probably wouldn't have character progression to sort through &amp; keep up with. Third-person shooters didn't either, despite similar potential. Not that I can really sort out how it would work, but platformers didn't give it a go either.\n\nI don't think these other genres are in some way less multiplayer-friendly; if anything I think arguably they might be *more* multiplayer friendly, and yet...None of them, to my knowledge at least, strove to build out their own large multiplayer games as a genre unto itself. So what is it about RPGs that led them to do so over other genres? \n\nMy suspicion is that it may be the tabletop roots, and slightly easier translation to early computers &amp; their networks, but I'm curious if there's another side to the \"MMO\" or big online game space that may have been eclipsed &amp; overtaken by the success of MMORPGs.",

Dialogue starts to become cringy and weird between the two of them (she still hates him, is reluctant to help, lots of therapeutic language peppers their conversation) as they embark on this quest. \n\nWhile you're walking through the jungle, Krato vaguely tells Freya that he understands the pain of losing a child, and reveals that he lost a daughter named Calliope. \n\n\"What happened?,\" she asks.\n\n\"It was long ago...\" Kratos answers. The conversation ends here. \n\n**THEN**, a few minutes later, *while the player is in the middle of a boring traversal section*, *Kratos reveals to Freya how Hades tricked him into killing his wife and child.* \n\nI can't overstate how much this ruined the game from it. The central-most event to his mythic character—the event that turned him into a Ares' successor and a destroyer of gods and worlds, the very source of wrath and anger and despair that fuels Kratos—is revealed to another protagonist halfway through one of the most boring, uneventful mechanics in modern gaming. \n\n[Watch it for yourself.](https://youtu.be/0MwFKW-XiXs?t=48)\n\nCan you imagine Ellie telling Dina about Riley's death during a boring, \"unlock the safe to get supplies\" sequence in TLOU?\n\nCan you imagine Atlas/Frank Fontaine delivering the famous \"would you kindly?\" reveal while you upgrade your weapon in Bioshock?\n\nThe marrying of bizarre dialogue with the worst possible gameplay sequence is baffling. I couldn't trust the team—who otherwise did technical miracles to make this game look amazing—to steward and deliver the source material in a way that was faithful to the weight of the story, the character's origins, and the true wrestling (not the surface-level \"muh trauma\") with the tension of being a protector vs a destroyer. \n\nI loved GOW 2018, but after this moment, Ragnarok  never recovered from me. \n\n(There's a similar event later in the story after Atreus returns from Asgard—he's been with Odin for who knows how long, allying with Odin for all Kratos knows‚— and Kratos/Atreus only discuss Atreus worrisome vacation in Asgard [while traversing totally generic sections and/or crawling under tunnels)](https://www.youtube.com/live/_pdZQI5UoXw?feature=share&amp;t=296).",

        "text": "Now before i start i have to preface this by saying that i'm an 2000's kid. But not like early 2000's kid. I was born in 2001 so by the time i got to start actively playing games to the point i could actually understand what was going on in them the year was 2006. So i grew up in the Brown military shooter era of the mid to late 2000's. I rarely (until the last 5 years or so) bothered to play games that were older than i was. That was until i played Prey (2017). Prey is easily one of my favorite games of all time and i mean that sincerely. It is one of the most well crafted and polished games of all time but that's not the point here. The point is that as i played Prey i naturally took a look online and watched videos and read articles about it. And almost every time, without fail, when Prey was brought up there was 1 other game brought up with it as it's inspiration: System Shock 2. I went to check and found the game was released in 1999. At first i was hesitant. The game quite frankly looked awful from the screenshots (I still maintain that the graphics are terrible even for the time) but it being brought up so much i caved in and decided to play it. And then...down the rabbit hole i went of Immersive sims. The thing about these 3 games is that not only are they fantastic but i think they can be considered the Holy Trinity of the Immersive Sim genre. Each one excells at being an Immersive Sim in it's own way and when i played them i was genuinely blown away for different reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Deus Ex aka \"Wait, this map's is really this big?\"\n\nAs a sidenote here i love just how quickly the game gets going. There's no long meandering unskipable cutscene setting everything up ( Hey Human Revolution), no long intro you always have to replay every time you start (I love you Prey but still) and no pointless exposition dump before i've even started the game (Hello 3D Fallouts. All of you). Past the training tutorial (which is also optional) you get plomped right into the action and i love that. But that's a side dish. What i was truly impressed by was the size of the maps. The very first mission in fact is so striking, having you infiltrate Liberty island and stopping a terrorist which sets up the plot brilliantly for what happens further on. The ammount of ways you have to tackle your objective, from the first mission to the last is astounding even today. \n\nThe fact that i love about this is that in reality the maps aren't really that big and they're fairly linear (the same objective is always there) but by having all these branching paths, all these different ways you can tackle your objective makes the world feel that much more grand and...heh...immersive if you will. It really is impressive what Warren Specter and the team managed to pull off on such primitive technology\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-System Shock 2 aka \"Level design? We're best friends\"\n\nSystem Shock 2 was bar none the game that Prey got most compared to in the videos and articles i saw. Some even called it a Spiritual successor. And after playing it i can definitely see it. Like these two games are Cease and Desist levels similar to each other. They both have machines which you use materials to get stuff with (They're even both called Replicators as well), they both have massive inerwoven skill trees that fit the setting seamlessly (even down to the space magic stuff) and they both, thankfully have amazing level design though i think System Shock 2 beats Prey just by a smidge in that department. \n\nWhy you may ask? Cause this is a game that doesn't have a map system and yet i NEVER, not ONCE got lost. Do you have any idea the talent in level design one has to have to make this sprawling of an RPG game, with interconnected paths, shortcuts, closets, entire different wings of the space station and to have the player never get lost in that mess? Every single area is SS2 is distinctive, even down to the different lighting in different wings that you'll almost never question where you are and where you're supposed to be going. Almost, there are some parts that are a bit iffy but they're nitpicks at this point\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Arx Fatalis aka \" Wait, i can do that?\" \n\nArx Fatalis unlike the previous two doesn't really have the complete amount of freedom in approach that Deus Ex has or the fantastic level design of System Shock 2 (the level design isn't bad but there's really only so much you can do with a dungeon crawler). But no, where this game exceeds and it had my jaw to the floor several times was in the fine details and interactivity it provided.\n\nThere's different footstep sounds your character makes depending on what you're wearing and this is different for every single piece of clothing in the game. So if you were to wear leather armor the walking sound would be different than if you were to be wearing metal armor. But that's not all, there's another variation here as well. Different surfaces also have different footstep sounds so when you add that to the equation that means that the footsteps on metal or stone surfaces you may make while wearing leather armor is not gonna be the same as the default walking with leather armor and the same applies to the metal armor and ALL the armors in the game\n\nFatalis has one of the best spell systems i've seen in any game ever where you have to learn different spells by completing quests or just finding spell stones in the world. You thenm have to draw the lines that are on the stones with your mouse, on the screen to cast the spell. This makes fights especially intense if you want to throw a fireball at someone and you have to pause and draw the spell before your opponent catches up to you. I mean you CAN quickslot the spell in one of the three quickslots but you wouldn't do that would you? (that's a joke you can do whatever you want the option's there) \n\nThe way things interact with the enviroment is genuinely insane and something that i seldom ever see even in modern RPG's. You can take a raw fish, place it on a campfire and cook it. You can upgrade your steel weapons by going to a blacksmith's shop and you actually have to place the sword from your inventory onto the anvil and work through the process yourself. You can grab wheat from the farms that are spread throughout the small town, combine it with flour you can also find in the towns, make bread and put it in an oven to bake it. YOU CAN DO THAT. it doesn't do much in the grand scheme of things, it just makes a food item that gives you health but that is so FUCKING COOL.",

I guess back then it was due to the limits of technology but over the time they could achieve it. (an example could be house of the dead remake)\n\nPersonally I imagine that playing a game like time crisis 2 with a good friend (online with a light gun) would be an awesome experience   \n\n\nWould be cool hearing your insights, thanks",

Please don’t ban me. \n\nI got recommended this video last week https://youtu.be/rJZyPdYIbZI and even though I played through all of Gears of War, I never even noticed the reload mini-game in Gears. Which got me wondering, how big of a newbie am I?\n\nI only ever reloaded if I was running away, cooling down, or in general not in the heat of an attack or whatever, and happened to notice that my ammo is low. I always assumed that reloading throws away ammo and I never understood why would I want to push ‘r’ or whatever button on a controller instead of just letting the game reload automatically. In fact I always assumed that 100% of players are in that boat.\n\nI’m by no fucking means a pro-gamer. I’m in my 30s, started playing games in the mid 2000s when my family could afford a computer, took about 9 year hiatus 2010-2019 when I moved, started a new job, and generally was figuring out life. I got back into it by the end of 2019 and then 2020 gave me even more time to experience gems from the decade I missed. I was however never a pro or anything. Not back then, and not now. I always play every game on “Normal” or “middle” or whatever default difficulty the game suggests. Sometimes I find a game too hard on that setting and change it to the easier setting to enjoy the story or journey. \n\nAm I just really stupid? When am I supposed to reload? And how to improve there?",
