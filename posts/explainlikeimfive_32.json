And a third observer would agree that both frames are moving relative to each other at a constant speed.\n\nHowever in general relativity one frame experiences a force of acceleration if it is accelerating compared with an another frame, whereas the other frame experiences no force. Given any two arbitrary frames that are accelerating away from each other how do we determine which frame is at a constant speed and which one is speeding up?\n\nSo for example if I'm at a station looking at a train accelerating at 10 meters per second per second I can definitively claim I'm not accelerating because I feel no force. Equally the passengers on the train can claim they are accelerating because they feel a force of 1G. However a third observer in _my_ theory could not say which frame is accelerating and which is at a constant speed. Because both frames appear to be accelerating away from each other.\n\nDoes this mean there is a definitive constant speed frame of reference in the universe that experiences no acceleration? Upon which all other frames can be measured? Does this mean the term relativity isn't that well suited, because if there is a master frame it isn't relative to your frame after all?",

        "text": "I understand why they're different one direction but I don't understand the other. I get how soundproofing does not equal sound absorbing. I don't understand how sound absorbing is not soundproofing. \n\nHow I see it:\nImagine I had a box that was built entirely with mirrors. Inside the box was a bright light. When the box is closed, you cant tell if the light is on or off. If there are any cracks or gaps in the box, the light is bright because not only is the light source bright, but all the reflected light inside the box has a chance to bounce off one of the walls and leave through the crack. \n\nSound absorbing is taking a glass box and painting the inside black. The light would still make it through the black paint, but because some of it was absorbed, it's a lot less bright. Any cracks or gaps in the glass lets light leave unaffected, but there are no reflections to amplify the light. When you look at the box, you can tell the light is on but it's not as bright. \n\nSimilarly, outside of a soundproofed room, you can't hear anything but inside, the sound would bounce around and it would be loud. A sound absorbing room would be quieter because you are only hearing the source, not any of the echos. Because of that, the outside of the room, the noise would be less due to the sound being absorbed, and the only way for the sound to make it out would be through gaps in the absorbing material or through the absorbing material(which would be absorbing the sound) reducing the sound leaving the room. \n\nEverything that I've read says that I'm wrong and that sound absorbing=/=soundproofing, but that doesn't make sense.",
