The NYTimes reviews aren't too hard to find if you just type in \"Pynchon [novel] New York Times review\", but I'd like to also see some less \"mainstream\" publications that provide ambitious reviews.\n\nDoes anyone know of a systematic way of finding contemporary reviews? So far, I've been trying my hand at Google and setting the date range in the search query to the year of the novel's, but this only seems to work from 1970 onwards.\n\nI'm grateful for any suggestions!",

Reading any single one of these canons would be a massive undertaking, which is leads me to my question: What pieces are among the most referenced by modern literature and would therefore be worthy of reading.\n\nAn example would be the last temptation of Christ section of the Bible, as the term \"Judas kiss\" is well established in the English lexicon. Another would be the plot of Oedipus Rex, as referring to something as Oedipal means the sons lust for the mother/hatred for the father, something a reader would be unable to pick up on if they were unaware of the plot of Oedipus Rex.",

I will be living here next year regardless, I know the Professors, they know I'm capable of doing something (hopefully) interesting so there is no convincing necessary, but I'm worried that I will do it and then someday back in the U.S. it will be worth nothing. As of a year ago they changed it to the three year doctorate which I think is like the one in the U.K. \n\nSo I'd like to get some thoughts on whether its possible to find work in some sort of interesting academic post in the States after obtaining such a degree, what kind of validity it might have, stuff like that. Obviously the quality of the program is relevant to the job post you get, this I understand, but the fact that it is European and in a non-English speaking country is my main concern. Or is the quality of my dissertation something which speaks for itself? \n\nCan I at most hope to end up at a remote, unknown college, a junior college, or not even that? \n\nAny other thoughts or advice is appreciated as well from anyone who has done or has seen examples of something similar.

        "text": "I'm referring to high 60-70s theory, especially figures like Lacan, Derrida, and occasionally Foucault. Here are the explanations I've heard (some of these may overlap or be simple variations):\n\n1) difficulty enacts textual drift or an endless chain of significations and viable interpretations; \n\n2) difficulty is \"performative\" in the sense that theorists like de Man are always reading every text with an eye to their self-reflexivity and the failure of that reflexivity to hold -- for the text to cohere on a philosophical or formal level. theory investigates and demonstrates something about a fundamental condition of language. I'm thinking of post-structuralism's love of the hyphen.\n\n3) difficulty in opposition to enlightenment/modern clarity and method\n\nI'm curious about the influences and/or genealogical anxieties that bring about this style of writing. The first guess (textual drift), as far as I can recall, primarily arose in response to modernism's investment in the autonomy of the work of art. The second (the \"performative\") could be traced back to Heidegger's interest in language's role in constructing human being/experience. The third I can see coming from Adorno, whose dialectical method and paratactic style function to produce a language that is something more than an object of mindless consumption. Adorno's reasoning seems to me to be the one which places the greatest amount of importance on difficulty for the sake of difficulty; not the house that pleasure built and one in which we can dwell, but a fortress impenetrable to jazz-listeners and movie-goers who haven't read and rejected Hegel.\n\nAnyway, what did I get wrong/leave out. Institutional/historical factors? I think what I've listed above counts as the official version, the story theory likes to tell about itself, but what doesn't it admit or not know about itself? ",

The only thing that I can remember is that it was from the late middle ages and that there are different seasons in a man's life that carry different priorities. The story or excerpt (it may have been an excerpt from something larger, I can't remember) served as a framing device for a single conversation. In the conversation a young man, a middle aged man, and I believe an old man were each asked a question whose phrasing I can't remember but it was in effect \"what is important in life?\" The young man spoke about adventuring, falconry, women, fine clothes, sport, and so on. The middle aged man spoke about accumulating wealth. I can't recall what the old man said. Not a lot to go on I realize but I thought there might be a possibility that someone would recognize what I'm talking about. If it makes any difference at all, at roughly the same time we were talking about the Wheel of Fortune (not the TV show obviously but [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_Fortunae))\n",

I've always wanted to go the PhD route, but at 24 decided I was sick of eating canned tuna and living in a house with 7 roommates (7!), so I got a non-academic govt. job, and then, through a couple of relationships I established in my position, started working in a field utterly unrelated to my education.\n\nYears have passed by, things have gone well enough in my working life, and I'm now in a position where I can take the time to go back and finish the education I've always desired, without the financial stress.\n\nSo I'm set on trying to return to school fall 2017.  But 2008 was a long time ago, and though I've spent a fair chunk of my leisure time reading a lot of the literature I expect to be using in my forthcoming studies, I haven't read anything that could be defined as theory.  Nothing.\n\nCompounding that problem is pretty much all the critical stuff I read in grad school nearly a decade ago - and I read the absolute bare minimum - was postcolonial, because my main focus was African lit. (I also did a fair amount with modern Japanese lit., but have no recollection of reading any criticism directly associated with it.  Just primary texts.  I'm sure that's not possible, but I can't recall it.)  But I want to do my PhD in English, and specialize in modernism, broadly speaking.  \n\nNow naturally a lot of poco theory, like any other field, can be applied to anything.  But I'm very spotty on even that, otherwise have huge gaps in my knowledge, and, I think, am woefully unprepared.\n\nSo to my question:  If I have a year to focus on getting ready to start my PhD, and I have somewhat limited time because I have a job that can require long days, and I am basically a blank slate, what should I read?  I don't know how to make the question more specific.\n\nAlso, how crowded is the field?  If the horror stories are true, I imagine quite, though I'm not worried about that, really.  If I have trouble finding employment I can fall back on my present career.  And I'm willing to go anywhere.  I already split my year between the US and UK due to my job, and I will be able to seek a position in either country with no bureaucratic hassle.\n\nThank you if you can help.",

As of yet, I am only collecting data, thinking of methods etc.\n\nPlease note that this paper is not intended to grind an axe. I am fully aware that women are gaining more relevant screentime in modern video games. Yet, (in-)dependence, abuse and oppression are going to be topics for my paper as they are still relevant today.\n\nMy rough guideline so far is Sarkeesian's \"Tropes vs Women\". I do enjoy the series, yet feel that Sarkeesian lacks in backing up her claims. Therefore, I would like to ask you how i could approach analysis of video games. Since my intuitions of \"this characters looks weak because of the camera angle\" is absolutely not academically legitimate, I was wondering whether you had any advice concerning this issue as well (psychology of perception/film theory).\n\nP.S.

I firmly believe that everyone has the right to derive their own enjoyment from a work or whatever media they consume. I will support someone who chooses to interpret something in a way of their choosing.\n\nHowever the problem I've been facing recently, is that individual interpretations...bore me. I don't say that to dismiss their value to the persons invested in them but when I stop to think of the potential ways even minor details can be interpreted, well, it's overwhelming. If true, that the reader is paramount in the exploration of a work, then that obviously implies that the potential scope of that exploration is limitless. \n\nI find it to be on a similar wavelength to the mathematical comprehension of infinity, and the scientific understanding of the universe. \n\nIt's with this in mind that precisely because the 'possibility is endless' that it in turn bores me. If someone talks to me about an interest based purely on its literal meaning, then I feel I can at least engage with that and have a conversation. Conversely, if the debate is centered around interpretation, then my mind can only think of the million other ways I could analyse the work that I don't have time to explore. It's this disconnect that makes interpretations so hard for me to engage with. The former is firmly understood, while the later is esoteric by nature.\n\nUltimately I make these statements to ask: **Am I missing the bigger picture?**\n\nI can easily imagine a proponent of literary studies feels the opposite, they find the endless possibilities equally fascinating. But given I have no background in the field, I do have to wonder whether I just haven't broken into it yet, or whether I unconsciously have and my apathy towards it *is* the interpretation.\n\nIf anyone would care to offer insight I would greatly appreciate it.",

        "text": "The pastoral mode seems to share many features with the sentimental mode. Especially with regard to their emphasis on the sensuous immediacy of experience, their focus on \"inartful\" and \"natural\" simplicity (I'm thinking of Pamela, for instance), etc.  It strikes me that the \"cult of sentimentality\" that we see emerging in the latter half of the eighteenth century mirrors the \"cult of pastoralism\" that we see at the century's outset with the Academia degli arcadi in Rome, for instance. \n\nIt just hit me as I was reading Vernon Minor's *The Death of the Baroque and the Rhetoric of Good Taste* that the two seem to be kindred spirits.  For instance, Minor discusses on page 71 \"the peculiar nature of the pastoral [in visual art] - its ability to propel the viewer into the work, to absorb him, and to make him a real part of a fictional space.\"  This seems like an attribute that we could (and often do) apply equally to the early novel (Minor goes on to discuss the relevance of Wolfgang Iser's study on fictionality to pastoral painting, for instance). The sentimental work of Richardson's Pamela seems to depend on precisely this \"absorption\" process, accomplished in part by the novel's epistolary format. \n\nI guess I'm just looking to see if anyone has done any work interrogating the space between the sentimental and the pastoral.",

He's reading Octavio Paz and Jack Gilbert now, and he also really likes Auden and Bishop. We just read Eunoia and it was a treat! Based on this info, does anything new he might love jump to mind? \n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I'm doing my MA degree in an English Dept and I'm very interested in narratology, esp the work of Genette, Chatman, Rimmon-Kenan and Peter Brooks. For an essay I want to read Jennifer Egan's 'A Visit From The Goon Squad' and pay close attention to the levels of narration in that book. I want to argue for the existence of a kind of meta-omniscience in Goon Squad -- something similar to Chatman's implied author, but more active. Does anyone have tips for doing scholarly work on narrative theory? I'm esp interested in suggestions on structure. In the essay should I work my way through all the different narrators in Goon Squad, or is that too mechanical? Should I go straight for the big things I'm trying to argue, such as the meta-omniscience? I realise this question is a little vague: I'm hoping someone is gracious and collegial enough to offer some suggestions to a beginner   ",
