New dealer proceeds to say how we're costing the table money and making people lose. I just kind of froze and got red in the face and super uncomfortable (doesnt help that my friend and I both have histories of social anxiety).  \n  \nFirst of all, we were at the table first. Secondly, blackjack has a strategy but with multiple decks in play it is still mostly a game of chance so we couldnt make the table win or lose if we tried. Lastly, its our money, we can do whatever we want with it even if its making typically incorrect moves, not like we're pros or anything anyway.  \n  \nI'm pretty salty though considering it was both my friend and I's first time ever at a casino and we got stuck with that negative experience.

        "text": "Hello, loves, new to this reddit. I've been playing about in r/talesfromretail lately. I rarely go about my shopping alone, but I ended up coming to work early yesterday. This is a customer story, not a \"I was working and-\" or someone mistook me for an employee there.\n\nMy AM (assistant manager) told me the wrong time to come in, so I showed up to work two hours early. That's fine, I had some time to myself to be more than a corporate drone, y'know? I was going to enjoy being a customer for once. I left my store, and wandered our shopping center to see what there was to see.\n\nAfter a while of being snubbed by clerks, I walked into a gift store that I liked to visit at least twice a week. They have a huge selection of candles. The manager was there and greeted me. We chatted a few minutes, then I started to peruse the new arrivals for fall. I was going through the sections, picking up a few votive candles of scents I liked. I hear the manager greet one of her employees coming on shift, but I kept looking.\n\nI was near the end of the candle section, and had a few candles in my hands. As I went to pick up a purple one, i heard the sales clerk talking with another customer. She starts to lead the customer over where I am. They're a few feet away, so I keep sniffing and deciding which scents I want. \n\nI go to pick up another one, and the clerk's hand moves into my line of sight. And lands on the candle I'm trying to pull off the shelf. Before I can do anything, stutter, call her a rude name, she takes it from my hand to show the other customer. I turn towards her, and she's edging herself as close as possible to me as she can get.\n\n\"Hey.\" I take a step back before she can step on my foot.\n\nShe glanced at me over her shoulder, continued talking, and moved into the space I was in. The other customer was in a trance I've seen my manager put some of our customers in. \nI just kind of stared at the clerk for a second, but seeing as she's not going to say anything or even acknowledge my presence again, I go to the other side of the store. I considered calling her a rude bitch, but stopped myself because A. they might not let me back in the store again, and B. the other customer might come into mine later. \nThe manager calls me by name, and looks over at the clerk who is happily loading this other woman up with high priced candles. Mine weren't as expensive. \n\n\"Hey, (name) that was very rude of you. Indigo's in here all the time.\"\n\nThe clerk looked back at me, and walked the customer to the counter to begin checking her out.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't even see her there.\" And begins ringing out the woman, not even giving me a second look.\n\nI'm not hard to miss. I'm really not. Upset, I walked up to the desk, put the votives down, nodded at them both, and went \"You ladies all have a wonderful day.\" And I left. As I left, I saw the manager gearing up for a lecture. Haven't decided if I'm going to go back while the other girl's on shift or not.",

        "text": "I'll start off by saying I'm pregnant and that is where a lot of this anger is coming from, I will be honest about that.\n\nToday, I decided I would like some drive-thru corporate chinese food for lunch. My boss agreed and offered to drive the 15 minute distance to get our food. She ordered teriyaki chicken, sauce on the side. She came back and there was no sauce on the chicken and no sauce on the side. Typically it is on the chicken if its not \"no sauce\" or \"sauce on the side.\"\n\nI got mad because I don't much enjoy plain rubber fast food chicken and I get sick when I get hungry. I decided to drive there and get the sauce and ask for my money back, since it's quite the drive. I arrive in the drivethru and let them know politely. Here's how it went down.\n\n&gt;Me: Hey sorry, my boss ordered my food about 20 minutes ago and it was made wrong. I drove back here so is it ok if I get that fixed and also get a refund?\n\n&gt;Drive Thru Lady: You'll have to talk to my manager, can you come inside?\n\n&gt;Me: Sure.\n\nIt is like 100 degrees out and I am pregnant and in pain usually, but I obliged. Once inside, this manager strolls over and we start to talk.\n\n&gt;Manager: Your order was wrong?\n\n&gt;Me: Yes. My boss ordered teriyaki chicken with sauce on the side and there was no sauce. Since I used gas to drive back here, would it be ok if I got a refund?\n\n&gt;Her: Well since you ordered it wrong, I can't give you a refund.\n\n&gt;Me: My boss ordered it correctly, it was made wrong.\n\n&gt;Her: If you ordered sauce on the side, it would say so on the receipt and it doesn't, so it's your fault and we can't refund. If you order sauce on the side or no sauce, it would say on the receipt.\n\nAt this point I'm arguing because she's being rude and not cause I necessarily need $7 back.\n\n&gt;Me: First of all, I didn't enter the receipt, your employee did. Second, if she didn't say no sauce or sauce on the side, you're saying it would say on the receipt. Since it says neither of those, that must mean she ordered regular teriyaki chicken. There is no sauce on the chicken so either way it was made incorrectly and I don't appreciate being talked down to.\n\n&gt;Her: Fine. But next time we won't do a refund because it's your responsibility to make sure its ordered correctly.\n\n&gt;Me: No, if it is made incorrectly it should be remade or refunded. Thank you.\n\nI mean, I was a little stubborn. We've all had food made wrong and it's only right to be polite to food service employees. But if you've ever been pregnant in the summer, you know firsthand how it was not fun driving down there and hauling my big butt inside. I was originally polite, but you don't talk down to a customer.",

Hopefully after I left the manger explained to the CSR what the phrase \"bottle deposit\" means in this context",

My daughter is usually a great kid, but when we step into the supermarket she is prone to tantrums.

Daughter decides she wants a chocolate frog, but as she's already eaten and had a treat after lunch, I didn't want to give her more junk. Cue meltdown. \n\nI'm making my way around the shop, people giving me and the stroller a wide berth, just trying to get in and out as quickly as I can. One of the staff members approaches us, smiling, and I'll admit I'm thinking: \"lady, I don't have time for this\", but to my surprise, she kneels down next to my daughter and offers her a pink paper heart. Maybe not a big deal to some, but that lady stopped the meltdown in its tracks! \n\nMy daughter is smiling again, I thank the lady profusely, and she goes about her business with a smile on her face. Like I said, it might not sound like such a big deal, but it really adds a bright spot to my day when someone goes out of their way like that, and it certainly made the whole trip easier. Great customer service, and I will be going back there for my regular grocery shopping trips. \n\nJust wanted to share something positive with you all. :) ",

After the movie let out, we decided to get a bite to eat.  It was late, and the middle of the week, so the restaurant we chose was not busy at all.  In fact, in addition to us, I think there were only two other tables with customers.\n\nOnce seated, I decided I wasn't all that hungry, and just wanted some fries.  My friend ended up choosing a full meal.  Our waitress was polite, friendly, and prompt.  Didn't even bat an eyelash over my tiny order.\n\nFood arrives quickly, not a hard order and no one was there, so that's not really surprising.  Food was good, no problems with that.  When we were done eating, my friend's plate was clean, but I still had fries I wanted to take home.  This is the part that made me so happy I decided to make my first Reddit post; I asked for a to-go box, and the waitress said sure, paused, then said she'd be a second.  Yeah, no problem.  I figured she just needed to get a box from the back.  When she comes back, it's with a box full of fresh fries!  I was stunned.  I checked the check, and there was no extra charges.\n\nI know this seems silly, and it's probably because it was late and they needed to get rid of extra food, but it just made me really happy.",

If it was, one of them wouldn't exist.  Second, even if it was the same thing in both bottles (which would be super messed up), I asked you for the stuff in the regular mayo bottle...I am paying for the sandwich I wanted...not the one you feel like making.\n\nIn the end, after she argued with me about the wrong mayo, she furiously threw the sub into the garbage and stormed off leaving me and the line of customers confused and alone.\n\nA minute or so later a different employee came out front, apologized and made me the correct sandwich. \n\nSeriously, what was wrong with that lady?",

Grabbing a shopping cart and fiddling with the list, I slowly and somewhat absentmindedly wander into the deli section (which is cheek-by-jowl with separate chain's Coffee Shoppe), when I hear all this clamor and din being raised by one form or another of obvious beatnickoid millennial type (geeky hat, vaping stencher, Ipad knock-off, skinny, gawpy, neckbeard, shorts and sandals; probably named Todd...) going ballistic at the barista. \n\nA small sample: [T] for the coffee idiot savant (without the savant part), [B] for beleaguered barista and, [M] is me, your humble scribe.  \n\n[T] \"You stupid bastard! This isn't what I wanted.\"\n\n[B] \"Terribly sorry, sir; but it *is* what you ordered.\"\n\n[T] \"Don't you talk back to me you bean jockey. I know that I ordered venti, half-whole milk, one quarter 1%, one quarter non-fat, extra hot, split quad shots (1 1/2 shots decaf, 2 1/2 shots regular), no foam latte, with whip, 2 packets of splenda, 1 sugar in the raw, a touch of vanilla syrup and 3 short sprinkles of cinnamon and this has only one splenda, 2 shots regular and 4 sprinkles of cinnamon [Not the actual order, but close enough for illustration].\"\n\n[B] *exasperated sigh* \"Very well, sir. I will make you another...\" as the line grows and grows because Todd refuses to budge and stands there snarling. \n\n[T]: \"You're goddamn right you're going to remake it. And damn quick. And I demand a discount for you wasting my time...arrr, growl, snap, woof.\"\n\nI'm standing on the outside looking in just marveling at this hunk of human flotsam and wondering what sort of unfortunate genetic accident could actually lead to something like this. \n\nHe then has the temerity to address the growing crowd: [T] \"I can't believe the service here. They're so fucking pathetic, can't even fill a proper order.\"\n\nThe folks in line, waiting nothing to do with this creature, just nervously chuckle, avert their eyes or stare intently at their phones. \n\nI, on the other hand, take my trusty Sharpie (I always travel with a Sharpie, doesn't everybody?) and in the spirit of the Rio Olympics mark '9.8' on the reverse of my Honey-Do list and hold it us so Todd and the rest of the crowd can see. \n\n[T] \"What the fuck is that supposed to mean, old man?\"\n\n[M] \"Old?\" 58 ain't old, I think and re-adjust the onion on my belt. \"That's your score. So close, so close...\"\n\n[T] \"So close to what?\"\n\n[M] \"A perfect 10 in the 'International Asshole and Total Waste of Carbon' finals. You missed it on the landing because you don't deserve a discount but do deserve a size 15 to the backside.\"\n\n[T] \"Whaddya mean by that?\"\n\n[M] \"What it means, Scooter, is that you're going to take your coffee (if one can so denigrate the drink), pay your bill and apologize to the nice Barista and thank him for not pouring a scalding Venti Americano over your head.\"\n\n[T] \"He wouldn't dare do that...\"\n\n[M] \"Perhaps not, BUT I MIGHT.\"\n\nA previous evening's festivities had left me semi-disheveled, I hadn't shaved yet and my hair was doing this anti-gravity Einstein-sort of thing so I must admit, even I wouldn't have wanted to cross swords with myself on this heretofore quiet Sunday morn. Plus, I think he was more traumatized by my ink than my demeanor (never anger a tattoophile vertebrate paleontologist. Tyrannosaurs could do you over in a second, mate).\n\nI've never seen someone quite so literally wilt.\n\nThere were a few high-pitched screechs from Todd that I guess someone could have taken for an apology. There were several guttural guffaws as the folks in line saw Todd have his ass handed to him. There were several snickers as Todd slumped and squeaked his way past a glowering geologist who knows what it was like to deal with the public (many long eons ago...).\n\nThe barista thanked me and offered me a free drink. I thoroughly enjoyed my coffee, and fed the barista tip jar about twice what the coffee would have cost. Ain't nothin' in life free, buckaroos.\n",

If I had my choice, I would pick somewhere else.  It's decent food, but over-priced in my opinion.  \n\nEveryone orders their drinks and meals and everything is fine when the salads arrive.  After that, the main courses arrive - for everyone except me.  The waiter drops off all the food, then goes back in the kitchen.  I figured it was to get my food.  \n\nA few minutes later, the waiter returns empty-handed and asks, \"Can I get anyone anything?\"  A few people ask for the usual things, like drink refills and whatever.  \n\nI say something like, \"Could you check on my food?\"  \nThe waiter apologizes, then asks me to repeat my order, which is reasonable.  It happens.  Somehow, things get forgotten.  Getting your meal a few minutes late is no big deal in this kind of place.  It's not like you're in and out anyway.  \n\nThe waiter returns with the drinks others requested, then asks, \"Is there anything else?\"  \n\nI say, \"Yes, my food?\"  \n\nThe waiter says, \"Oh, right.  Let me go check on that for you.\"  \nHe disappears again for a few minutes, then returns again empty-handed.  \n\n\"Can I get anyone anything?\"  He asks.  Again, there are some drink orders an whatever.  Then, he gets to me.\n\"I'm still waiting on that food,\" I remind him.\n\n\"Oh, right,\" he says.  \nThis goes on like this until the check arrives.  I never did get my food.  \n\nWhen the waiter returns, I tell him, \"I'm not paying for this.\"  \nHe says, \"Why not?\"  \n\"I didn't have this!\"  I tell him.  \nHe tells me he'll be right back with my food.  I tell him I don't want it.  He says he'll box it up for me.  I say, \"Fine.  Okay.\"  \n\nBelieve it or not, this guy disappears for a few more minutes, then returns and says, \"Your food will be here in just a second.\"  \n\nI wait a few more minutes and the guy doesn't return, so I get up and go to the counter where you pay for take-out.  I tell the girl behind the counter the abbreviated story.  She says she understands, but gets a manager.  I explain it to the manager.  She says she needs to talk to the waiter to \"get to the bottom of this.\"  \n\nWhen she returns to the counter, she tells me that her waiter tried to give me the food, but I wouldn't accept it.  I tell her that he said he was going to get me the food and he never returned.  \n\nShe asks me if I'd pay for the food now if she brought it to me.  I said, \"Sure.\"  She goes to the back and when she returns, she asks me to pay and that my food will be out in a few minutes.  \n\nI left cash for my wife's meal, both drinks, and the amount of tax, and left.  \n",

It’s not that important to me.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Awesome Dude: We can absolutely do that, but unfortunately I would have to recreate your contract for the phone since it’s technically a different product. It can be a time-consuming process, and usually takes about ten to fifteen minutes. I’m very sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Me: Oh, no worries.

He apologizes several more times about how long it’s taking, and each time, I’m like, “It’s totally fine. I’m not in a hurry, I understand you have to do what you have to do.” and finally after about the fourth or so such occurrence, he goes, “You know, you’ve just been so understanding about this, I’m going to go ahead and bump up your shipping to overnight for free.”\n\n\nI thank him profusely, we finish out the call, and I get my new phone like a week earlier than I would have before, feeling really pleased about the whole thing.",

I realised what I did though and apologised.\n\n&gt;Me: Oh no, sorry that one *was* my fault, I pressed the wrong account!\n\n&gt;Lady: (angry stare)\n\nI tried again with the correct account and the transaction went through and she handed me my receipt.\n\n&gt;Me: Thanks, bye!\n\n&gt;Lady: (still angrily staring) bye.\n\nMeanwhile next to me there was a very old lady being served by the other employee. She was one of those customers that takes a long time asking lots of questions and was quite demanding/bossy. Luckily she was being served by a slightly more patient girl. All I could think was thank God she didn't get the lady who served me!!",

        "text": "So today my mom and I were out shopping at a large department store. I've found the service in this store to be poor in the past (taking a while to even find the checkout, let alone a person) but today was especially bad.\n\nWe find a checkout and approach the counter, but the two folks behind it don't acknowledge us and just continue sorting items or something. At first we were just annoyed, but then we realized that they weren't even employees, just customers who'd wandered back there. No idea what they were doing, didn't look like they were up to anything, so we just continued to wait for someone who actually works there.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, I decided I'm just going to go back there myself and see if there's a button on the phone or computer that might page someone. Normally I wouldn't go behind the counter like that, but I figured maybe it'd get someone's attention or I'd be able to call someone. This counter was clearly open, but unmanned.\n\nIt worked. I stood behind the register and started examining it, and *immediately* someone walks over like \"excuse me, can I help you!?\" obviously annoyed that I was back there. Everyone in line (by now a handful of people) laughed at how quickly they responded. I hadn't even touched anything yet.\n\nMy mom makes a comment like \"wow, that's how you get service\" and the clerk snaps \"no, that's not right\". Mom snaps back \"neither is waiting 10 minutes for someone to show up\". Suddenly the clerk's demeanour did a 180 and we all (including the customers behind the counter) got rang out quickly.\n\n**tl;dr** going behind the counter and pretending to push buttons isn't the way to get service, but you can't argue with results.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/4wwijx/slippery_sales_tactics_from_a_lawn_chemical/",
        "text": "Hello!  First time ranter.  (And reading back over it, it really turned into a rant.)\n\nA few years ago, we hired a company to come out and spray our lawn with chemicals.  The results have been pretty good - far fewer weeds, the moss that was growing is gone and replaced by grass, and it just looks better.  They charge us something like $80/treatment, based on the size of our lawn.  It's a lot of money, but we can afford it, and we are seeing good results, and we'd like to sell the house in a few years and want it to look good, so no problem so far.\n\nA few months ago, they called us selling us a bug treatment package.  We could do one treatment, or we could get multiple treatments, in which case the first treatment would've been free.  We decided to do the single treatment, which they did a few weeks later, and I paid the ~$80 or whatever it was.  Still no problem, I expect companies to try to sell me extra services like that, and we hoped it would cut down on some ants that keep getting in the house.\n\nThen, last night they called me again.  The script went like this, \"We're just calling to confirm that we can do the next two bug treatments on your yard.\"  So, of course, the first impulse is to say \"yes\".  But, wait!  They didn't mention that it would cost $160.\n\nFortunately, I was quick enough and caught the implication.  It wasn't even that they wanted to sell me more services that bothered me; what pissed me off was the slimy way they phrased it.  Instead of an adult conversation between a professional and a homeowner, I got the stereotypical fast-talking salesman.  I told the woman my issue (referring to the \"script\", so that if she was just following a script, I knew it wasn't her fault), and I told her that my wife and I are going to think about whether we want to continue our service with them at all.\n\nI hope that call was in fact monitored for QA and gets reviewed.  If they're a half decent company (which they probably aren't; few are), they'll call me back and apologize and get to keep my business.\n\nThey aren't the only ones, by any means.  Tricks seem to be a common business tactic:\n\n* Every now and then the newspaper tries to trick us into getting 7 day delivery, instead of Sundays only (for the coupons, and so we can use their website for free).  I can't remember the exact phrasing they use, though, but the end result is I end up picking up papers every morning and recycling them.  It got so bad we told them we'd cancel entirely if they switched us to 7 day service.  We fell for it once but are now more careful.\n\n* A cellular carrier used to call me every few weeks after my contract ended to try to trick me into signing a new two year contract...\"We can update your agreement over the phone!\" or something like that, carefully avoiding the use of the words \"contract\" and \"2 years\".  They almost got me the first time, but I realized what was happening and stopped it in time.  I always asked, \"What's the benefit to me?  I don't need a new phone right now.\"  \"You lock in your rate!!\"  Yeah, except competition does that for me, and the limits on talk time got better over time, not worse.\n\n* A few years ago, we met with a salesman from a company that sells meat, delivered to your freezer, which they also deliver.  They do it in a scammy manner, with a crazy formula that uses the number of meals to calculate a cost which includes a freezer (or knives, or something else, so you really have no clue how much anything costs - as far as we could tell, you can't buy only meat).  My wife and I both have degrees in mathematics and statistics, so this isn't a matter of us just not understanding the formulas.  It was intentionally difficult or impossible to follow, relying on factors from various tables that seemed to have little relevance.  It should be simple: You're buying x pounds/servings of meat, plus a freezer, discount the freezer, and your total is...  It was done the other way to make it difficult to ask sensible questions.\n\n* But the real scammy part of the meat sale was that the salesman portrayed it as \"You spend $200 a month on groceries?  Now you'll be spending the same amount!  See, no extra cost!\"  Except they don't deliver things like milk, eggs, bread, fruit, vegetables, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa, ketchup, cereal, deodorant, and shampoo - you know, all that stuff you buy at the grocery store that's not from the meat section.  When I pointed that out, he clicked his pen shut and started packing up; he knew he wasn't going to sell us any meat.\n\nIn each case they obfuscate what they're saying so that they can claim, \"You agreed to X!\"  Yes, but X was intentionally unclear.",

        "text": "So, this just happened.\n\nA little background: I work with the state liquor commission. I'm one of those inspectors that goes to your place of business and determines, based on the state of your kitchens, your bathrooms, and your general building state, if you can keep your liquor license.  Yeah, health inspector, except I cover building inspection and security inspection as well.  This has no relevance to the situation.\n\nThis does:  I carry a badge, mainly so I can quickly identify myself and my authority during an inspection, since I do a lot of surprise inspections -- it's come in handy quite a few times.  No, it's not a police badge. but it does kind of look like one.\n\nI'm at the local convenience suoer-store, picking up some snacks.  I get behind some guy who's just grinning like he's won the lottery.  He gets to the counter, and I'm fiddling around with my phone.  Then I hear the conversation between the cashier (C) and the grinner (G).  \n\n&gt; C: I-I'm sorry, sir, I-I-I can't take this.\n\n&gt; G: It's legal tender.  You have to take it.\n\nCuriosity piqued, I look up to see what's going on.  The cashier has turned a very light shade, and the grinner is only grinning wider.  And on the counter?  Grover Cleveland's picture in green.\n\n*This dipshit's trying to break a thousand dollar bill at the convenience super-store.*\n\nThe kid working the register is a little wild-eyed, probably wishing his manager were there, but it's Sunday night and he's faced with some idiot who wants to buy cigs and soda with a $1000 bill.\n\nSo it goes for about five minutes.  Cashier obviously can't take the bill, and grinning doofus says it's the smallest bill he has on him.  (*Really?*  You're carrying bigger denominations?)\n\nI have the feeling this guy's trying to throw his weight around, getting the kid in trouble by claiming to the manager later on, that he tried to pay but the kid refused to take his money.  In any case, the kid can't take the bill, that much is obvious, and this grinning jerk *is* a jerk, for trying this in the first place.  So I decide to poke my head into this, or we're going to be stuck here all night.\n\n&gt; Me: That a thousand dollar bill?  Wow.  Mind if I look at it?  I won't touch it.\n\n&gt; G: Sure.  Ain't never seen one of those before?\n\n&gt; Me: Oh no, I see them quite a lot.  You know, yours is missing that thread in the bill.  Looks like it's a counterfeit.\n\n&gt; G: No, it's real!  I got it from the bank!\n\n&gt; Me: Oh sure, they can be fooled too.  But see this? \n\nI take out a $100 from my wallet, and show it to him.\n\n&gt; Me: See the stripe, right there?  That's in all the currency.  Counterfeiters can't reproduce it, since it's in the paper itself.  Yours doesn't have that.  You need to take it back to the Treasury department and get it destroyed.\n\n&gt; G: Hey, this is my money!\n\n&gt; Me: It's not even money, pal.  \n\n&gt; G: How do you know?\n\nAnd that's when I reach into my back pocket, take out my wallet, flip it open and drop it on the counter.  Badge shining happily in the light.\n\n&gt; Me: I work for the State Treasury.  \n\nThis guy's face turns **absolutely white**, and he grabs the bill off the counter and is gone into the night.  \n\n&gt; C: Thanks, man, I couldn't take that bill.  It was really a fake?\n\n&gt; Me: I have no idea.  Those threads are only in the paper for twenties and hundreds.  Only an idiot would counterfeit a thousand, since no one can ever change them.\n",

Google Play Gift Card Support took 1 day to email me back, can't blame them, because they are such a popular business, and their employees should not work 24/7 in Juli vacation.\n\nSo I gave the company a screenshot of the confirmation from a Google Play Email Support Employee that the card is unactivated.\n\nThey now gave the Seller another day to give him a response on what he had to say, or give anyother proof that the card DOES work, before I would get a refund.\n\nAnd the Seller ofcourse did not respond.\n\nAnd finally.. after 12 days of waiting they gave me a reply saying that they will give me a refund ASAP.\n\nSo the next day, I checked my Paypal, but nope, no refund gotten.\n\nSo I checked the site if they had any Wallet System, they did, but I did not got it on their Wallet System either, so I contacted the companies support again, when they said I had made a dispute on the order through Paypal and that that should be handled first.\n\nSo I closed the dispute, contacted them again, and told me I would get a refund once their \"specialists\" get to my \"case\"... they probably ment by clicking a few buttons to send me a refund.\n\nI was told this would take at maximum, 24 hours, in the worst case scenario.\n\nI guess I got the worst worst-case-scenario, because I have now been waiting 2 days for a refund.\n\nOh and don't forget to mention the other 12 days I had to wait before I could send any proof to the company or send any replies.\n\nI am now still waiting for that refund, and by now me and my Friend has already given up on hope, because we are thinking we got scammed the hell out of our money.\n\nNo matter what I do, their support says \"Please wait for our specialists to get to your case, and since they are not 24/7 active, there may be a bit of delay.\"\n\n**/rant on**\n\n....WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DELAY? I HAVE WAIT OVER 2 WEEKS TO GET BACK 10$, WHY MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL OVEr 10$ SERIOUSLY, YOU ARE A BIG COMPANY WHO MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A DAY, AND CAN'T CARE TO GET SOMEONE TO PRESS A FEW BUTTONS AND SEND BACK CUSTOMERS THEIR MONEY?\n\n**/rant off**\n \nI just can't believe this..  All I am waiting for is someone to press that button to refund me the money, like, come on, what are your \"Specialists\" doing? Sitting back and eating some cake and coffee before they actually start \"working\"?\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: A very bad company with a very bad support system and service, that can't afford to give back 10$ in just a few clicks, and instead, put me in a waiting queue of refunds, or whatever they are doing with \"reviewing\" their cases of their \"daily customers\", and waited over 2 weeks now and still haven't gotten any kind of refund.",

So I sent them an email reminding them that in our province gift certificates of this kind legally cannot expire.\n\n10 minutes later I get a screeching phone call from the location, telling me I'm stupid and wrong and that the certificate has an expiry date on it.\n\nI inform her that the date on the certificate is the date of issue and that legally she has to accept the gift certificate.\n\nHer response is the title \"You should have told me your policy changed\"\n\nI shook my head and said \"Well since we only started running this company of January 2016 and the law changed in November of 2007, I really don't see how this is my responsibility. I suggest you call the customer and apologize now\"\n\nI doubt she will and if she doesn't, I might just inform the customer that she could make a stink about it to the government and they could impose a fine anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000.\n\nEDIT: The customer called me back and thanked me for helping her. The area manager called her back and gave her cash back for the gift certificates. There is some small justice in the world.",

The main characters of this story are my mother and one of her friends, who had just moved to the US from South Africa (I will refer to her as F, and it is relevant that she still had a heavy accent). One day they pulled up to a drive thru to get some lunch with me, my brother, and the friend's son in the back seat. All of us in the back seat were 2-3 years old so I don't have any memory of the events of this story.

A few!\"\nE: \"No, FUCK YOU!\n\nE handed my mother the food from the window with a glare that could burn through steel much more quickly that jet fuel, while my mother was laughing her ass off at the mix-up.

        "text": "When medieval fairs started to get big here in Europe 10 or 15 years back, we wouldn't miss one the biggest one. I mean the tourney alone was worth the price of admission. We already knew most of the story cliches by heart. Black Knight is usually the best swordsman. Green Knight always wins in the end. One of the knights will be a lady. The king will gasp when she removes her helm, and so on.\n\nOne year, we knew the brown knight personally. He was last years black knight and a living Ragnar Lothbrock straight out of Vikings first few seasons. This year, the master at arms was the black knight, because they wanted to include some flail fighting (which s another level of mastery altogether). Each knight would have bleachers of their appropriate color, for whom they'd ask cheers, and a fair maiden's token.\nAnyhow, we wanted to go to the Brown Knight bleachers because we knew him, or the Black Knight bleachers, because he was going to fight with a flail. For this reason, we were first in line, because we are geeks and proud of it.\n\nWhen we get in we make a bee-line for the Brown bleachers, but volunteer drives us to the Green Knight bleachers, and decides to cram us, and waaay too many people there. He said we'd sit where he said we should sit. My friend commented to her BF \"This is f\\*\\*\\*ing crazy, we've been coming here for years, and this is a first\" as she sited where ordered. The volunteer goes bananas. \"You shalt not cuss here!\" I go crazy. \"In what f\\*\\*\\*ing country am I? I'm pretty f\\*\\*\\*ing sure I can f\\*\\*\\*ing cuss, as f\\*\\*\\*ing much as I want!\" \n\nThe guy was grabbed by other employees, my friend's BF who was trying to calm her down, was now trying to calm me down, and so on. Green Knight's bleachers was packed. The remaining 5 bleachers were nearly empty when the show started. The fucking show wasn't even close to packed, he was just being an idiot. We were trying to find out the volunteer's name (for complaint reasons), but he didn't have a name tag, and the other employees didn't offer his name despite us asking for it, politely (they were also very polite might I add, they just dodged the question or flat out refused to answer).\n\nHalfway through the show, my friend decided to leave with her BF. We were uncomfortable and way too crammed, and couldn't enjoy the show because of how it all started. When she got up the nameless a\\*\\*hole came and stopped her from leaving. Apparently he had already stopped a lady with a baby as well (with similar complaints), saying we had to wait for the show to end, because there were horses running around, and we had to cross the field (half the bleachers, including Brown's where we tried to sit initially, were by the exit, but we were curraled into one that wasn't). \n\nNow, World War 3 almost goes off. A old polite guy gets up and says he also wants to leave, and no one will dare stop him. I get up and say \"F*** this shit, I am leaving as well, you f\\*\\*\\*ing forced us here, and now are f\\*\\*\\*ing keeping us trapped? This is f\\*\\*\\*ing illegal, and I'm pretty f\\*\\*\\*ing sure ASAE (regulating entity) will have a field day with it!\" \n\nThe \"I am Spartacus!\" crowd started getting bigger and bigger. By the end, over 30 of us walked off. In front of the King and Queen and the jousting knights.\n\nMy friend and a few others went ahead and complained in the complaint book (every business has to have one here and can even be finned for their employees/volunteers actions after an investigation). She wrote the guy was unidentified, didn't give his name when asked and other employees refused to surrender his name. We did leave the physical description. Apparently it was not the first complaint against him, and I doubt it was the last.",

While the store is indeed open 24/7, I guess the lady doesn't have the same schedule, so that's understandable. Furthermore, she just washed the slicer, she doesn't want to go through that again and I don't want to be a dick. I glance at the watch: 9:35 PM. Huh. 25 minutes left on her shift. I guess she probably has other work stuff to do as well, I'll let it go, I don't care that much if I slice it myself. She slams a large ham on the table and grabs a knife.\n\n&gt;Deli Lady: How much did you want?\n\n&gt;Me: One pound.\n\n&gt;Deli lady (moving the knife around the piece of ham, not knowing where to cut): How much is that?\n\nShe doesn't know how much to cut. Patience is a virtue. I'm not gonna be an asshole.\n\n&gt;Me: I have no clue :)\n\nI actually added the smiley face, as it was a smiley-face-worthy situation. Why would you ask a customer how large a 1-pound piece of ham should be?\n\n&gt;Deli lady: Well how should I know?!\n\nBecause you work here, shithead. Because in this relationship I'm not the one who should know, you are. Calm down. Not an asshole. She probably has a shitty day, same as you. Don't make it worse for both of you. Just.. shut up.\n\nShe puts the piece of ham on the scales: 5 pounds. She then proceeds to cut about a third of it. I consider mentioning that 1/3 of 5 pounds is not 1 pound, but she quickly puts it on the scales. It's a pound and a half.\n\n&gt;Deli lady: Will this be all?\n\n&gt;Me: Lady, I don't need this much ham.\n\nI'm becoming slightly irritated. She cuts down about a quarter of a pound. She puts it back on the scales. It's a pound and a quarter.\n\n&gt;Deli lady: Is this okay?\n\nI don't want to deal with this shit anymore.\n\n&gt;Yeah.\n\nThis is not the first time employees have been rude there. I hate that goddamn store.",

We go in, no one there. (it wasn't quite the middle of the night, but late). Not unusual in small motels, when the proprietor might be sleeping (we once had a guy in Tennessee toss the key out to us in the middle of the night from the second floor, yelling \"Pay me in the morning!\")\n\nI'm feeling bad for maybe waking someone when we weren't going to be giving them business and thinking we should leave, but then we hear something. Looked over the counter, there was this old lady hog-tied on the floor, she had just been robbed. We untied her and called the police. \n\nThey came, took our statements (Old Lady: It was two n*****s! Cop, writing it down: \"nigers\") (that stuck with me, thought it was funny).\n\nOL fell all over us, promising free accommodations for the rest of our lives.\n\nFor some reason we end up at the police station for 3 hours, I have no idea why. They seemed baffled that anyone would drive the length of an entire state just watch the sun rise. (to be fair, it's a small state). SO didn't help matters by telling them we were 'on a quest'. \n\nThey gave us coffee and donuts and left us alone in the room with the mugshot camera for an hour. Somewhere, in a small town PD in CT near the RI border, is a picture of my boobs.\n\nEventually they thanked us, and then let us into the beach before it opened, which was nice of them. Not quite the Atlantic, but close enough.\n\n(not sure if this is the right sub for this, but didn't know where else)\n\n\n\nTL,DR: On a quest to see the sun rise over the Atlantic, rescued an old lady, boob pic now on file.",

        "text": "Rewind about two years. My family and I had just gotten off of a magical cruise--my son's first. I'm actually a lifelong cruiser, and this particular cruiseline is by far my favorite. I decided I wanted them to host one of the most important events of my life: a formal wedding for two of my cats. So I emailed their customer support the following message:\n\n&gt; Dear Major Cruiseline,\n&gt; \n&gt; I was hoping Major Cruiseline would be able to accommodate my family for a very special event. I would like to host a formal wedding for my cats, Zooey Glass and Francesca Rosaline Alexandria Grier III. Franny is a Ragdoll/Himalayan mix that we adopted in 2006 and Zooey is a Snowshoe that we adopted in 2007. They've become quite close over the years and we think it's time to make this official. If it a matter of money, don't worry--we can pay for their stateroom. Do you have special services for honeymooners? They would mostly stay in their stateroom, although they would likely attend dinner in the dining room with the rest of us. (Don't worry--we will ensure that the dress code is adhered to!) Is this something you can accommodate? Thank you for your response!\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; pulpexploder\n\nI waited eagerly for a response. Weeks went by. I had almost given up all hope when I got this response:\n\n&gt; Dear Mr. Pulpexploder:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your email. Please accept our apologies for the extended delay in our response. More customers than ever before are choosing the convenience of email as their primary mode of communication. As a result, the turnaround time for responses has increased. Acknowledging that this delay is unacceptable regardless of cause, we hope you will accept our regrets, and believe that this is not indicative of our normal operations. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are truly honored that you have considered Major Cruiseline to help facilitate a wedding for your cats. Regrettably, Major Cruiseline does not allow pets onboard its ships, with the exception of certified service animals. We apologize for any disappointment this may cause.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a Gold member with our [rewards program], we value your loyalty and appreciate this opportunity to respond to your inquiry. The [rewards program] was created to show how much we appreciate you by offering recognition programs, members-only benefits, and valued rewards. To view a complete list of member benefits available to you please visit: [website].\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Pulpexploder, thank you for choosing Major Cruiseline. We are eager to show you the personalized Gold [rewards program] service that keeps our guests loyal to Major Cruiseline, and we look forward to sharing millions of wonderful memories to come.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; M.E.\n&gt; Customer Service Representative\n\nI quickly fired off my enthusiastic reply:\n\n&gt; Dear Major Cruiseline,\n&gt; \n&gt; This is fantastic news, as both Franny and Zooey are certified service animals! I have mobility issues and am deathly allergic to mice. The cats have kept me safe on a number of occasions. The cats unfortunately don't qualify as service animals by American standards, but we were able to get them certified in South Africa. Does this count? I'm also teaching them how to count and identify loose papers. I might be able to get them American-certified in time for the wedding. Do you offer any drink packages to honeymooning service animals? Thank you for your response!\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; pulpexploder\n\nWith such good fortune (I *knew* it was a good idea to pay that guy on Craigslist to certify my animals in South Africa!), I waited eagerly for their inevitable acceptance. As before, weeks went by, but I eventually got this reply:\n\n&gt; Dear Mr. Pulpexploder:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your email. Please accept our apologies for the extended delay in our response.\n&gt; \n&gt; For cruising purposes, a service animal is defined as any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability. Animals that do not meet this definition, such as service dogs in training, emotional support dogs and animals other than dogs, may be accepted only with pre-cruise approval. Because the animals in question are not dogs, approval must be granted in advance by our Access Department to allow them to sail. To submit your service animal request, please contact our Access Department by phone at 1-555-555-5555. Notice should be given no later than 60 days prior to the sailing date.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note, due to strict United Kingdom regulations, service dogs are not permitted on cruises to the United Kingdom, with the exception of the Major Cruise Ship sailings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kindly note that guests are responsible for obtaining all documents required for service dogs to depart the ship in non-United States ports. A copy of these documents must be carried on the ship, and the copy must be left with Guest Relations Desk upon boarding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, although we offer a variety of beverage packages, they are limited to humans only. We apologize for any disappointment this answer may cause.\n&gt; \n&gt; We look forward to welcoming you aboard soon. Whether you are interested in Caribbean beaches, Alaskan glaciers, European history, or the beautiful landscapes of Asia, Major Cruiseline can take you there, with world-class entertainment, delicious food, and exciting onboard activities. We invite you to sail with us on the Major Cruise Ship #1 or the Major Cruise Ship #2, which both include a living garden, onboard zip line, the surf simulator, and more. We also encourage you to consider our newest ships, the Major Cruise Ship #3 and the Major Cruise Ship #4, featuring a skydiving simulator and the [restaurant], which allows guests spectacular views above the ship and over the ocean.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Pulpexploder, thank you for choosing Major Cruiseline.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; E.M.\n&gt; Customer Service Representative\n\nNotice they passed me on to another department via phone. I've played that phone game before when I tried to order a functioning time machine from Major Online Computer Retailer--they just pass you around forever and you never reach anyone who can help you. Needless to say, I was crushed. My cats, soulmates in every way, would have to have a Vegas wedding like some sort of animal.\n\nI just thought I'd pass this cautionary tale along here as a warning for anyone wanting to host a formal wedding for their cats on a major cruiseline.",

        "text": "I regularly go to this supermarket close to my house to buy groceries, nothing weird has ever happened and the staff have always been really nice. Until Today.\n\nToday getting everything was ok, but since it was a Sunday the lines were really long. I was waiting for about 10 minutes when I saw a woman walk into the cash register and start it up, I initially didn't go into that line cause she wasn't wearing a uniform but she waved me towards her line so I walked towards her.\n\nShe was a bit slow getting started but I didn't mind, she got through everything and gave me the final price. She then said that as I was so kind in waiting she would give me the special 10% off reserved for only some special goods (none of which i bought). I happily obliged and bought my goods and went home.\n\nWhen I got home I got a call from the manager (I gave them my number when i signed on for a rebate card) and he was fuming and asking me about the woman who checked me out at the supermarket.\n\nIt was actually quite funny when i got him to finally tell me what he was angry about, it turns out he fired this woman for being a bad employee and now she returns sometimes and logs into her coworkers profile on the cash register checking one or two people out and giving them discounts so the store would lose money but she would leave before anyone started to notice. This was the second or third time it happened and they were trying to stop her, even going as far as to install new security cameras. I can't even make this stuff up.",

        "text": "So I was at a fast food restaurant tonight. I was in the drive-thru and I pulled up to the speaker.\n\n**Drive Thru Employee:** Welcome to [Restaurant Name], please hold just a moment.\n\n**Me:** Okay.\n\nI'm sitting there for a good five minutes. I thought about just pulling away, but I was stuck in the lane because the drive-thru had some weird island thing that I couldn't drive over without seriously destroying my car. So, I decide I'm going to try to get their attention.\n\n**Me:** Excuse me? Hello?\n\nThere's no answer. Again, I can't drive out of the drive-thru lane, so I consider moving up. They're completely blocked. So I sit. Horns are honking and I wave out the window like \"Sorry, can't move!\" \n\nFinally, after a few more minutes, I decide it's time to pull out my phone and try calling the restaurant's number. I've tried to get their attention six or seven times, and nothng. At this point, I'm stuck, and I'm guessing the drive-thru attendant forgot about me. As I'm looking up the number on my phone, some guy walks up to my window and literally sticks his face in there. \n\n**Guy:** [Shouting] Are you going to fucking MOVE?\n\nI screamed. So loud. Because 1) I wasn't paying attention, and 2) Some random dude came up to my car and screamed at me. I started crying (out of shock, really, it was stupid), and explained that I couldn't move and they hadn't taken my order and I was stuck. Everyone was stuck.\n\nFinally, I hear the speaker as the guy walks away continuing to shout something. \n\n**Drive Thru Employee:** Is there a problem?\n\n**Me:** Um, yeah, I've been trying to get your attention so I can order and a guy just screamed at me for not moving, and I can't move because things in front of me aren't moving.\n\n**Drive Thru Employee:** I'm sorry, what can I get you?\n\nSo I get home, and my boyfriend is one of *those* customers. Sorry, customer service people everywhere, I feel bad. He calls the store manager and starts screaming at him. He has it on speakerphone.\n\n**Boyfriend:** So some guy cussed out my girlfriend because you fuckers can't keep things moving at a reasonable pace!\n\n**Manager:** Sir, we are sorry you're disappointed in our service, but we were short-handed and we cannot control our customers and we are not responsible for their actions...\n\n**Boyfriend:** You know what, fuck you! If you would have kept the line moving, my girlfriend wouldn't have been treated like this. Did you even *know* you were backed up at the drive-thru? Where were you? \n\n**Manager:** Sir, that isn't relevant...\n\n**Boyfriend:** Yeah, you're not relevant to me anymore, buddy. Fuck alla y'all and fuck this restaurant; we're not coming here anymore. \n\nTL;DR: Drive-thru was backed up and I couldn't leave. I got very angrily cussed out by a guy in line behind me and my boyfriend is an angry customer and calls the restaurant to \"avenge\" me being startled.",

        "text": "My husband and I were hungry for dinner one night and decided to eat at a local fast food restaurant. We went inside and the place was empty. Like deserted empty. No customers and no employees. \n\n\nI was pretty worried because I once saw this true crime show about a fast food robbery where they took all the employees into the walk in fridge and killed them. I just thought the complete emptiness was unusual.\n\nWe stood at the counter for a few minutes and I was about ready to get the hell out when finally an employee comes out from behind the back. She looked like a crackhead and I don't mean that in a mean way, she seriously looked like she probably did a lot of drugs and when she spoke she had the cigarette voice. \n\nShe casually strolled out and had her phone in her hand. She stood at the register not once looking at or greeting either of us. She seriously stood there scrolling down her phone. \n\nI didn't know what to do or say and neither did my husband. We stood there until she said, rather rudely, \"waiting on you guys...\"\n\nMy first instinct was to just leave cause she was being so rude. I am a food truck manager, so I know how it feels to be tired and not wanting to take orders, but that was a pretty rude way to take care of customers. \n\nMy husband, who isn't bothered by anything, began ordering so I decided to just deal with it. Somehow she got out order right and thankfully more people appeared soon after, but that initial interaction was ridiculous. I don't think she ever really looked at us. ",

If anyone has suggestions for formatting issues or whatever, I welcome them. \n\nSo, yesterday I went to a local discount grocery store I shop at every week. I had a long list, including needing bleach. I had found everything on my list, and was looking and looking in the cleaning/detergent aisle for bleach. I went up and down the aisle 3 or 4 times and didn't see any bleach. I checked the time and see it's about 20 minutes before the store closes, so I just give up and get my items checked out. \n\nI decide I'm going to the store next door that's open later to buy my bleach. I walk up and down the cleaning product aisle for probably a solid 10 minutes. There is every cleaning product known to man, but no bleach! I haven't seen any employees to ask, and I head to the register. At this point I've decided that I must be dumb, how can two stores both be out of bleach? \n\nI suck up my pride, because I don't want to go to a third store, and ask the cashier about the bleach. He looks at me quizzically and points in the direction I just came from. I apologize and tell him I just can't find it, and I'm sorry but could he show me? There aren't any other customers in line, so he walks me to the huge, gigantic, glaringly obvious display of bleach that I'd walked past TWICE while heading to and from the cleaning product aisle. \n\nI felt like such an idiot and wouldn't be surprised to see his side of the story on another \"tales from\" sub, but I got my bleach.

As I'm scanning my stuff, I hear the theft prevention go off, and look up just in time to see AP chasing down some guy with product in a bag.  The AP yells out, \"Stop!\"\n\nNow, there's one of those big metal benches right next to the door.  There's a young woman right next to it, adjusting her shopping.  Without pausing, she kicks the bench HARD to the side, and the would-be thief runs right into it. He flips over the thing, dropping his bundle in the process, and AP is on him.\n\nDunno what happened after that.  Got out of there with my purchases.  But that takes some mental flexibility, to suddenly think of blocking the door like that.",

So we walked in and we are just browsing around when one of the employees very politely comes up and asks me hey could you please leave you drink up at the front for me? Now having worked many years of retail my self I said absolutely just as politely back and just asked her to show me were she wanted me to place them. \n\nThe poor thing had clearly been berated before because she was so shocked I was nice back to her. She just thanked me profusely so I asked her have you had people yell at you about it before?\n\nShe then tells me oh yes all the time. They act as if I am going to slip drugs in their drinks while they are away from them. That's my money I gotta spend on that for you she tells me. That's not gonna happen.

It's been a while.\n\nOn my 17th birthday, my mother had ordered an ice cream cake from the ice cream parlour down the street. It was something of a tradition at this point to do this for birthdays, so it wasn't really a secret. Still, she didn't want to send me to pick up my own birthday cake, so she asked my brother to go get it. My brother took our friend with him, because as teenagers it's impossible to do anything alone.\n\nA brief aside about the friend. He was a member of a long line of a military family. He looked like he had been born ready to be a marine. This was the kind of guy who did knife-hand push-ups in the drainage ditch behind his house wearing a hundred pound pack in the rain and called it a warm-up. Super nice guy, usually. Must have been about 200 pounds of pure muscle at the time.\n\nSo my brother, and Muscles, go to the ice cream parlour. My brother has my mother's credit card to pay for the thing, but Muscles is somehow under the impression that it's been paid up front.\n\nEmployee: Okay, here's the cake. That'll be $money.\n\nMuscles: What? No. It's already been paid for.\n\nE: The order says it hasn't. It's $money.\n\nM: *Slams his hands on the counter and, through gritted teeth says: It's. Already. Been. Paid. For.\n\nE: ... Oh, look at that. It's been paid for. My mistake. Have a nice day!\n\nI still feel bad for that poor employee. When they got back to the house he found out that it had, in fact, not been paid for. To Muscles's credit, he drove back to the store, apologized profusely, and paid for my birthday cake. He meant well, really.",

        "text": "So, this whole thing started in 2010, when I was about sixteen years old...\n\nBack then I lived in a small town where everybody knew each other.\nOne day, a friend of mine told me about a new opened store (a thrift store, where you could buy used DVDs, CDs, LPs, Games and so on...). I was curious, because we hadn't had such a store in our town, so I went there to see what they have to sell.\nWhen I first arrived there, I saw the shopowner behind the counter (It was only him working there all the time). He seemed very friendly and he had a lot of cool stuff there. I was really impressed because I could find some rare DVDs for a fair price.\nAfter some time, this store became my favourite place to buy stuff. I could have fossicked in this cozy store for hours, talking with the shopowner about movies, games and so on.\nBut one tuesday morning in November, School was cancelled for some reason, I went to this store to see if he got new stuff. I can remember that I haven't been there for two weeks or so and therefore I hoped to find some new treasures.\nI went in and was greeted by the shopowner with a polite, yet restrained smile. There were no other customers besides me. I went to the DVDs to see what he has got. After five minutes, he came to me and asked: \"What are you doing?\"\nMe: \"Oh, I am browsing through the shelves.\"\nHim: \"Are you looking for a specific movie?\"\nMe: \"No, just browsing, maybe I'll find something interesting\"\nHim: (he got louder and very unfriendly) \"See, I don't know what your fu*king problem is.\" (gesture and facial expressions became really aggressive) \"You come in here, walk through my shelves and making a HUGE (his voice became really loud, and he also approached closer to me)  mess and I have to clear up this f**king sh*t\" - although it's not true. I am very careful and always arrange the DVD cases how they were before. I even clean my fingers before touching them, so the plastic cover doesn't get greasy)\nMe: (pretty shocked and confused) \"Umm... No, I...\"\nHim: (shouting as loud as possible and talking very fast) \"**YOU ALWAYS MAKE SUCH A HUGE MESS!!! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM??? ARE YOU JUST TOO STUPID? RETARDED PIECE OF SH*T GET OUT OF MY STORE RIGHT NOW!!!**\"\nI couldn't move, because I was so shocked.\nHim: (He approached further to my right ear, coming very close and shouting very loud) \"GET OUT!!! (I started to move) GET OUT!!! OR I WILL FU*KING KILL YOU!!! AND NEVER COME BACK HERE! SPOILED BRAT YOU COULD\" - I finally shut the door and was outside.\nThis incident really left me speechless and I nearly started to cry. I was thrown out of many stores for no apparent reason, but this was by far the worst experience I ever had. I told everyone I knew this story but most people did not believe me, saying the story was just made up.\n\nI don't know why this happened to me. I didn't do anything wrong. I never made a mess in this guys store, nor did I behave inappropriately in any way.",

        "text": "This happened a couple of years back, and I have absolutely no idea why it never made the news.\n\nThe local mall, at the time, was doing mallwide sales to drum up business.  15% off, and the individual stores had their own sales too.  I needed some things, so off I go.\n\nGetting to the mall, I walk in through the entrance to the food court.  Once inside, I'm forced to walk around a large group of ... brown-skinned individuals all yelling at each other in some language I did not recognize.  There must have been about twenty, all told.  Mall security is present, and they're set up at the tables, watching this group.  In fact, they have their phones set up, recording the incident.  (I thought, Oh crud, this is going to end up on YouTube.  Nope, turns out it's mall policy for the security to record incidents.)\n\nObviously nothing is being done, but it's not escalating, so I head into the mall to do my shopping.\n\nAbout an hour later, I'm a little hungry, so I head back to the food court to get something.  And the crowd has gotten larger.  Still all yelling at each other, very angry for some reason, and now some of them are stabbing their fingers at each other.  Now there are four security there, and they have an actual video camera with them.\n\n(I did ask the woman at the food court stall what happened.  She said that two groups walked in at the same time, and started pointing fingers and yelling at each other.  Next thing she knew, mall security showed up but none of the people in these groups seemed to understand security.  Cops had been called, and security was just waiting for them now.\n\nRefreshed, I head back into the mall to finish my shopping.  There's a store inside with a cute manager who I've been talking to in the past, and I figured I'd go hit her up and see if I might get her to go out with me.  So she and I are chatting, and that's when an announcement comes over mall public announcement.  They're calling all available officers to the food court, in addition to maintenance.\n\nWell, now I just gotta know.  I tell the girl I'm going to go check it out, and head back to the food court.  I get there about twenty minutes after the announcement; I wasn't hurrying or anything.\n\nThe place has become a warzone.  There are tables knocked over; chairs scattered.  There are several redemption games in the food court; they look like they've been tipped over and broken into.  The cops are there in force.  The paramedics are just arriving.  The two groups are now separated to either side of the food court.  Several members of either group are in the process of being arrested, or awaiting medical attention.  And the food court stalls are mostly all shuttered.  \n\nI observed for a while, and it was right about then that the interpreter arrived.  Once she started talking to the two groups, it became obvious that this was some sort of Indian-Pakistani incident, with a couple of groups getting to the mall simultaneously, and not being able to let bygones be bygones, they started shouting at each other.\n\nShaking my head, I went back to my conversation with the store manager.  Got back to the store just in time to hear the announcement over the mall PA that the mall is closing three hours early.\n\nBonus: I got to take the store manager out to dinner.  She's my girlfriend now.\n\nTL;DR: Learn to take pleasure in reading and READ THE GODDAMN POST!!!\n\n",

I hear her tell him \"finish that iced coffee\" and he instantly looks panicked and asks how. \"Fill it with cream and ice\" she didn't tell him how much cream and he still looks confused as she turns away and ignores him.\n\n\n\nMe: \"Cream to the top line, then ice.\" He glances at me confused, still.\n\n\nMe: \"I used to work here, it's cream to the top line, right under my name, and then ice to top.\" \n\n\nThe whole line of people laughs and the barista meant to be training him glares at me for doing her job, which I don't care about, since if she's not gonna do it, I'm sure going to make sure my drink it right.\n\n\nHim: \"Oh, thank you!\" He grabs Heavy Whipping Cream\n\n\n\nMe: \"Oh no, that's whipping cream, don't use that. The cream has a brown lid\"\n\n\nAgain, more glares. Again, don't care.\n\n\n\nHim: \"Oh ok, so half and half is the same as cream? Thank you, I didn't know.\" More proof nobody has trained this poor guy.\n\n\n\nMe: \"Not a problem, I know how hard it is. It's a really tough learning curve, you're doing great.\"\n\n\n\nHe thanked me and I smiled and wished him good luck. I'd report it to the manager, but I happen to know the manager, he used to be a shift leader at my old store. I know he won't be thrilled and could even write her up, and I just don't want to be involved.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: I wrote to corporate about the situation, they should get back to me within a business day.

        "text": "Oh mega online customer service you have failed me again.  Once again my tablet has broken.  About a year and a half ago it died on me and I jumped through hoops to get it fixed.  Today the power button stopped working.  However, if I plug it in or unplug it the tablet will turn on and work just fine.  So I called customer support to figure out what to do.  \n\nThe gentleman who answered said his name was 'Brian' with an accent as thick as ground chili.  I give him all my information and tell him the issue.  He then asks me to hook up my tablet to my home computer so he can run a diagnostics check of it.  I tell him that I don't think that is the problem but do it anyway.  He takes me through letting him in the system speaking to me like a two year old the whole time.  I understand that many customers are not intelligent enough to hit the 'ok' button but I am and I have already been through this about six times (which I told him).  So we finally get in and he starts trying to tell me the reason my tablet isn't working is because there are corrupted files on my computer.  What?  That makes absolutely no sense.  He proceeds to open this program and tries pointing out to me all these open ports and telling me that is why its not working.  \n\nAll through this I have him on speakerphone and my husband who was a computer programmer for years is giving me the look of WTF?  I keep explaining to the guy that it is not a file issue it is a hardware issue.  Everything is working fine except the power button.  He keeps trying to tell me the reason it won't turn on is because of corrupted files.  I explain that it turns on when I plug and unplug and it works fine everything functions except for the power button.  He refuses to listen to me and keeps trying to insist it is a file problem.  \n\nBecoming frustrated I keep asking for a supervisor or another service person and he keeps insisting that it is a file problem and talking over me and not listening.  Finally I yell \"I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE!\"  and he puts me on hold to transfer me.  About a minute goes by and he comes back on and says \"Ma'am I can fix your corrupted file issue for a small fee of $29.99 would you like to use Visa or Mastercard.\"  \n\nI just start repeating \"I want a supervisor, I want a supervisor, I want a supervisor, I want a supervisor...\" until he finally just transfers me.  About two minutes later a very nice lady answers and I explain the problem to her and she instantly goes, \"That sounds like a hardware issue.  Unfortunately, we can't fix that and because you are over the one year warranty we can't fix it for free.\"  \n\nI inform her that I had purchased an extended warranty because of the previous issues and it is a two year warranty.  (I still have the paperwork)  I explain that I am NOT over the two year warranty and she keeps insisting that I got my tablet in 2014.  I keep telling her that I bought my first one then but this particular one is the fifth replacement and I received it a year and five months ago and so it is not past the warranty.  She insists that the paperwork says that it is from 2014 for the extended warranty and so it does not count because the tablet on the warranty is not the same as the one they replaced it with and so I just give up.  She asks if I would like pricing to fix or replace it and I just tell her I am going to buy from the fruit company because I'm done.  I've had six replacements, and all six have had various issues turning them into bricks after less than a year. \n\nTl:Dr; Customer service rep tries convincing me that I'm an idiot and don't know how to push a button.",

        "text": " Holy God, I've had an infuriating three weeks.  It all started when I called to set up internet installation in my new apartment I would be moving in to.  I went to the company that my complex recommended we use and called a week in advance of moving in.  I was told they were running a special where I could get 18MBpS bundled with a landline for $50/month, with a three installment installation fee of $100.  Wow, good deal right?  So I set up the account and installation and thought I would be fine.  Fast forward a week.  The Wi-Fi modem was installed and I had a place to put a home phone if I choose to use it, cool, guy left and I had internet!  Problem: it was super slow. I mean, really slow.  So I called to ask about this, and thus started my personal hell.  I asked why my internet was so slow when I was told up to 10 devices could be connected without a drop in speed, and I couldn't even load a YouTube video.  I was told that my internet speed was only 3MBpS.  Hold up, What?  I explained this had to have been a mistake and that I had ordered much faster service, and I wanted to know what the hell was going on.  Naturally it was a Sunday and the department that handled these claims was closed, so I had to wait a day.  The next day, when I called I was told that the service I agreed to and ordered was not available at my location, and should have never been promised to me, so the fastest speed I could have was the next to lowest 3MBpS.  I'm a student, so I need internet, so I begrudgingly agreed and asked what my new monthly bill would be.  I was told $20 a month, which included the phone bill (even though I had no plans of buying a home phone).  I felt this was a fair price for the shitty speed I was getting, so I left it there and wanted to move on.  BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE; a few days later I wanted to set up autopay for my bills.  Naturally, their customer accounts website was garbage and my password had been set up for me (yay) without any notice (fun) so I had to call to get that resolved because the website password recovery feature was broken and would not send an email to change my password, even after waiting 24 hours.  So I get my account working and lo and behold, my bill for the month was almost $170 dollars.  I was being charged for the entire installation fee, $45 a month for internet and phone, and various taxes and such for the rest.  I called to get this fixed yesterday and was told I would be called back before 8PM by a supervisor to settle this issue.  Nope.  So now, after over an hour on the phone, I have angrily talked to several people and gotten my bill down to $10 this month (I'm surprised too) BUT, I have to call AGAIN in a few hours to finalize all the things I canceled and received credit for because the company's system is down (of course).  Needless to say I am beyond unhappy at this point.  \n\nTL;DR: Was promised very fast service and split installation fee, was given very slow service with no way to upgrade for the same price and one-time installation fee.  One broken website, several phone calls, and lots of yelling later my bill is now $10 as opposed to $170, with more phone calls still to be made.",

        "text": "I hate to fly.  Not because of they flying part, but because it's just so awful in terms of the service you get and the nonsense you have to deal with.\n\nUnfortunately, my husband and I wanted to go somewhere you could only get to on a plane so reservations were made 2 months in advance.  I made sure to schedule all the legs of my flight with enough layover time to account for any delays.  I did not want to miss a connecting flight, so sitting around the airport for a couple of hours between flights was the way to go.\n\nA month before the flight, I go online and check my reservation because I'm a control freak.\n\nWould you look at that?  My going-to-place flights have been changed.  The second flight leaves before the first flight even gets to that airport.  Cute.\n\nDid I get an email because I signed up for alerts?  No, no I didn't.\n\nSo I call the handy number provided.  The only flights they have available comes with a 35 minute layover between the second and third flights.  This is at a major airport.  I'm pretty sure there is no way in hell I can get from the second flight to the third flight in that amount of time, even if the second flight is on time.\n\nI ask if I can move my first flight to the day before so I can take an earlier flight that would provide more time between flights 2 and 3.  I'm willing to pay for the hotel overnight.  No, no I can't, because that would be too easy.\n\nMy only other choice is to cancel the whole reservation and try to get a new reservation that will get me where I'm going.  I don't want to do this as my lodging reservation at my destination is non-refundable.  You know, that reservation that I only made after I had booked my initial flights?\n\nSo I go ahead and let them change the res so that there is only 35 minutes between flight 2 and 3.  I figure the worst that will happen is that I won't make the flight, they'll re-book me on the next available (probably the next day) and I'll only lose one day at my destination.  Shit happens.\n\nWhat's that you say?  All the premium seats I had booked now cost more so I'll need to give you more money?  Really?  Yes, really.  I go ahead and pay.  In for a penny, in for a pound.\n\nI hang up and get online to write the airline a nice complaint about 1) not being notified of a substantial change in my flights when they most certainly had my email and 2) being gouged for more money for my premium seats.  They email me back saying they have to look into it, but no promises.  I write-off the extra cost in my head.\n\nTwo weeks later, I look at my charge statement and they have refunded me the extra charges!  Wow, never thought that would happen.\n\nThe day of our trip arrives.  Our first flight goes well.  Our second flight does not.  It's 45 minutes late taking off.  Crap.\n\nThen a miracle happened.  The pilot got us to airport #3 on time!!!!\n\nWe rush off our plane (well, you know, as fast as you can rush through a sea of humanity).  I've already scoped out airport #3 online and I know there is a tunnel that connects the terminal we arrived at to the terminal flight #3 takes off from.  There is a snowball's chance in hell we can make it.\n\nWe run (as fast as old, arthritic people can run).  \n\nWe don't make it.  \n\nAs we reach the gate, there is a gate agent asking if we are Mr. and Mrs {insert name here}.  We say yes!  She says: \"They've closed the doors already\".  Dammit!\n\nThen she has us follow her down the loading ramp saying she shouldn't be doing this.\n\nThen...they OPEN THE DOORS for us!!!!\n\nAs we are hurrying onto the plane, I'm looking for the Candid Camera because there is just no way a major airline did us this solid.  \n\nExcept there was and they did and we vacationed happily ever after.",

This was before the store closed at 9 and I didn't have much I needed to buy anyway.  \n\nWith my basket in tow, I ventured to the cold-pressed juice aisle which is near the deli and takeaway hot foods.  And that's where I ~~spotted~~ heard *him*.\n\n\"HEY, LOOK! IT'S THE DELI GUYYYYYYY!\"  A grown man shoved his cell phone in this unsuspecting employee's face and was **recording** the worker with his cell phone!  No, this man was not mentally ill, but he may have been drunk or just a jerk.  I was standing off to the side and I could see this guy was zooming in and out of the worker's face.  The person behind the counter looked to be in his mid 20s, but I have to hand it to him for keeping his composure while this guy carried on this way.  His companion on the other hand seemed visibly embarrassed, but that didn't stop him from attempting to make other customers part of his \"movie\".\n\nI turned the corner to get someone, but by that time the couple must have gone to another part of the store.  Before last night, I have never experienced something so alarming.  It may have been funny to that guy, but don't put a cell phone in anyone's face.",

        "text": "This past weekend, one of my closest friends from college was getting married, so my boyfriend and I packed up and flew out there.  Once we landed it was around 9:30pm and we still had about a 90 minute drive to get to the resort.  I'd known this in advance, so I called the hotel the day before to let them know it would be around midnight by the time we got there.\n\nCheck in was a breeze, I texted the groom to let him know we were there and he was going to meet us at our room.  Here's where the fun begins.  The key doesn't work to get in the room.  So the groom accompanies me back to the front desk to get new keys.  Get back to the room, keys still don't work.  This time we call down to the front desk.  They send someone up with new keys to try and open the door.  Still no luck.\n\nNow it's time for maintenance to get involved.  The maintenance guy arrives and starts working on the the card swiper itself.  No luck.  Can't figure out what's wrong.  A manager and another maintenance guy come up to try and fix the problem.  They finally figure out that one of the locks had been tripped.  (It was kind of like one of those chain locks.  It can only be done from the inside.)  They figured someone had bumped it on their way out earlier.\n\nThey spend the next 10 minutes or so trying to get the locks undone.  Until finally someone comes out of the room.  We'd been trying to get into the room for over a half hour at that point and they'd slept through the whole thing.\n\nBy this point we're all furious and are forced to make another long trek back to the front desk. No one seems to know who the people in our room are, where they came from, or how this mix up happened.  And now we're getting told that they might not have any rooms for us.\n\nAt this point my friend loses it.  He's stressed about getting married the next day and wants to make sure that all of his family and friends have rooms and needs to know if he's going to have to have us share a room with him and his groomsmen for the night.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the front desk find out who the people in our room are, and that they are able to put us in their room.  Only problem is, that I prepaid for a suite so my boyfriend and I could have a romantic weekend.  And the room we're now getting is a room with two double beds, that's big enough to hold the family of four who booked it.  We're told that our first night will be free, the second night will be half off, and to go talk to a manager in the morning to see if a suite becomes available.\n\nNext morning, we go to the front desk.  They can't switch us  to the room I booked, but the entire weekend is now free, which included a bottle of wine and a small spa basket.  We were also offered an additional night stay and they'd get us the room that we booked.  Unfortunately we had to catch a flight back home.\n\nThe staff was nothing but friendly the whole time, but it's just really frustrating that it took an hour to figure out what the problem was and how to fixed it.  And that even when we talked to a manager Saturday morning, no one knew how it happend.\n\nTL;DR:  Hotel put someone else in the room I booked, took an hour to figure it out and get us a new room.  Entire stay comped.",

        "text": "About 5 years ago, average day in the office, a coworker sends me a link to a major online retailer with a mispriced item. It's a really nice $350 Canon camera listed for $35. I'm not into photography at all, but that's a hell of a deal, too good to pass up, so I go for it.\n\nI hurry to create an account, get the item in my cart, and checkout. It thinks for a while, then finally comes back with an error. I go back into my cart, it's still $35 + shipping, so I try again and it goes through. I message my coworker thanks, that I'll buy lunch today, and go about my day.\n\nIt wasn't until later I checked the email associated with the account and see the \"thanks for your order\" confirmation. I open it, and it shows 1 Sweetass™ Camera for $350... I flip out, check my bank, nothing charged.\n\nI call them immediately afterwards, explain the situation, and the rep tells me nothing was charged because that item is on backorder (presumably from all the people jumping on their error). He says he'll cancel the order and that's that. I check my bank account for the next couple days and don't find anything amiss, so I assume everything is ok. This is mid-October..\n\nFast forward to mid-December and that event is gone from my mind. I'm out Christmas shopping and go up to the counter with maybe $200 worth of gifts. Card declined. I say- no way, I just checked last night and budgeted everything out for the holiday and I'm actually under. He tries again and no-go. I eventually do the walk of shame and abandon my cart full of stuff with the poor clerk.\n\nI get home, check my bank, and find a $350 charge from company.com. Holy fucking hell, right in the middle of the X-mas stress, just what I needed. I call them up, and they tell me that the camera had been on backorder and just now came in stock, so they charged my card and shipped it yesterday.\n\nI explain what happened, that I didn't even want the camera, and the rep said she sees the notes where I called in to cancel, but it never happened for whatever reason. She's sympathetic, but says her hands are tied since it's already shipped. I'll have to wait 5-7 days for it to arrive, send it back, wait a day for processing, then I'll get my refund. There's no damn way- with the normal holiday shipping crunch, that would put me past Christmas easily.\n\nNow, not only am I without my gift money, the extra $150 means I'm completely broke until EoM when I get paid again, and also means I'll probably bounce a couple of small checks I had sent to a couple nephews. That or call them and tell them they can't cash those checks for a while and look like \"that guy\".\n\nI'm bouncing between tears and livid frustration, trying to get someone on the line to help, but even the managers say they can't do anything. They offer $50 gift cards and such, but because of the value of the item, there's nothing they can do until it's returned. Like I want anything effing thing to do with your company ever again after you completely ruined Christmas this year.\n\nI made one last call after half a day on the phone, got told the same things once again, but this rep said she'd make sure this got brought to the attention of Biggish Boss. I thought- yeah, that's a clever way to get me off the phone and said whatever. I was seriously contemplating faking an injury or some work emergency that pulled me out of town, something to give me an excuse to completely miss Christmas.\n\nAbout an hour later I get a call, and it's from BB. He says [rep] brought this case to me and holy shit (his words), I'm glad she did. I could tell by this guy's demeanor that he wasn't part of the normal CS chain. He's super-apologetic and says we'll make this right. He goes on to explain that even at his pay grade, anything over $250 automatically gets routed to the fraud department, and that could take a week sometimes, so he proposes this. He refunds me $250 today, I keep the $50 gift card \"to wipe my ass with\" (he laughs- I guess I said that at some point in time), and keep the camera when it arrives. That'll work.\n\nSure enough, the $250 is back in my account within a couple hours, and the camera and gift card show up a few days later. Now that I'm able to breathe again and think clearly for a minute, something clicks. Mom has been wanting a new camera for a while to take before/after pics of her work (interior design) and put them online.\n\nSo now Mom has the most kickass gift I've ever given her, and is off the list. $50 card makes a really nice gift and marks another off the list. I'm now waaay under budget for Christmas, so I step it up a notch for everyone else too.\n\nEven though those events probably took a couple years off my life, in the end it was one of the best Christmases ever. BB even sent me a company card with something along the lines of \"sorry about the mess\" along with his business card with direct line to him if I ever needed it.\n\n",

We check out at a self check out and as we are leaving the receipt check guy is checking someone else and there are a few other people waiting. I just want to go home because we got very hot and sweaty outside today and we have work in the morning so we walk past the guy and the person he is currently checking because it shouldn't be a big deal. The guy who will now be referred to as E (for employee) called and followed after us I know for a fact we don't legally have to stop for E so as he is calling after us we ignored him until we were outside and the person he had been checking said something to us. \n\n\nWe walk a couple steps back towards the door and give E our receipt because it seemed like E was going to chase us all the way to our car over this stupid receipt!  Now I know in this moment I was a dick but the following exchange happened. \n\n\nMe: \"Legally we don't need to stop and show you our receipt this is stupid! I know you are just trying to do your job and it's not your fault you have to do this but this shit is stupid! I shouldn't have to wait in a line to show you my stupid receipt!\" \n\nE: *barely glances at and marks my receipt while I'm shouting* \"I'm just trying to do my job!\" \n \nF also shouting: \"we legally don't have to stop for you!\" \n\n\nHe didn't even see the shit we had in our bag he couldn't have taken more than 5 seconds of looking at it before he marked our receipt. I'm just sick of being treated like I've done something wrong for going fucking shopping. I know other people are stealing and they have to do this to treat everyone the same but this man was going to chase after my fiance and I for buying stuff! \n\n\nI'm so done with this stupid receipt checking policy and I've only been to hell mart 3 times since they started it! \n\n\nI know I shouldn't have shouted at E and that he's probably been shouted at many times since they started this policy but I'm a customer not a criminal it's upsetting to be chased for my receipt! \n\n\n\n\nEdit/update: I went and apologized today.

There was only a price under the new model (and the price was questionably high for a pawn shop sale as it was) so they asked what the difference was since they obviously looked different but seemed to be priced the same. \n\nThe employee said they were the same and just different to give customers options. They told the employee they'd take the Elite model since it was for a young kid and the matte finish wouldn't get smudged with finger prints and look nicer. So the employee went to get a key to unlock the case. \n\nWhen the employee left I approached them to warn them of the ***real*** differences. Things like the Elite model was older and more prone to overheating and disc scratching, but most importantly that the S had 250 gigs of storage and that the Elite model there **didn't even have it's HDD on it.**\n\nI told them to take their money to an actual game store where they could get either the Elite (with the HDD) or the S for less than the pawn shop was asking and probably get a better return policy if the hardware was faulty. \n\nThey seemed surprised that a game store would be cheaper but I pulled up the store site on my phone to show them. They thanked me, gave me a $10 bill and left.",

        "text": "Not my story but watched the whole thing unfold. \nWas at a cosmetics store, themed black and white, with my SO when we noticed these two teen girls acting like they were hot shit wandering around the store grabbing and touching everything. Nudged my SO out of the way so they could grab items that weren't even in front of him. \nAfter about 5min of being next to us the head manager walks over and in the nicest, calmest voice possible says \"Sweetheart, we see you two and know what you've been doing. Turn out your bags now and these two kind officers will assist you in finding the door.\" The girls at this point started to get defensive and insisted they've done nothing wrong and that they're being targeted. One of them shows the manager the basket she's holding with 3 items in it (a foundation and two brushes) and responds with \"why would I steal when I'm putting things in the basket?\"\nBy this point there are now 4 sales associates and two loss prevention officers plus the manager surrounding the girls and the girls eventually surrender their purses from which the manager begins removing stolen products. We (my SO and I) lost count after 24 products. The basket, which started with 3 products, was replaced with an empty basket and the retrieval process continued! At the end of the whole ordeal the girls were escorted out by two cops and the manager gave em the fiercest mean mug I've ever seen. \nNow my SO and I joke about the situation. For instance, if he's trying to be sneaky and I catch him I'll tell him \"sweetheart I see you.\" ",

I go through them all, finding nothing, until I find a glorious, radiant, Pokemon Red in a 25 cent box full of junk. \n\nThen, I guess probably nervous looking as I was so excited to actually have a real Gameboy Pokemon in my hands, walked up to the lady selling the item in question. I show her what I'm purchasing, and the money in the other hand. But then out of nowhere, she just stands up, snatches the game, mumbling somethimg about how she must've made a mistake. Afterwards, she disappears into her house, and I sadly return to my father's car, empty handed.",

There's also this random nice guy there who we'll call RNG and another barista who we'll just call B.\n\nBL: \"Excuse me, how long does it take to pour coffee?\" (she said this very, very rudely) \n\nB: \"We're just brewing some now.\" \n\nB hands RNG a coffee, and RNG says that BL can have his (he looks very taken aback at how this lady just spoke to the cashier).\n\nBL: \"Are you sure?\" \n\nRNG: \"Yeah, go ahead.\n\nBL, to cashier: \"Is this bottom of the bin or is this fresh?\" (again, she is sounding hella demanding) \n\nC: \"Um, it's not the freshest...\" \n\nBL: \"Then I'll wait.\" (rude tone, basically slams RNG's coffee down onto the counter)\n\nThey then gave her a new coffee and she stormed off. \n\nI understand that old coffee might taste gross, but you don't have to be rude about it. The cashier was very polite and handled it very well but there were other ways this customer could've asked for fresh coffee instead of being so demanding and rude to the poor baristas.... Then again, this was at the airport and she looked like she was tired, but still. Baristas at the airport are already very busy and could've been just as tired as she was. \n\nedit: i said bitchy too many times in one sentence, it annoyed me. ",

        "text": "So recently I went to my bank to get some money out of the ATM. I got an error message at the ATM and so I went inside. The manager looked up my account and said that it had been locked by their card services department...ok then. \n\nSo they tell me the call the customer service number on the back of my debit card for more information. I do this and after being on hold and getting a run around for nearly an hour on the phone, the representative tells me the department that handles this does not accept calls from customers, and that I will get a letter in the mail. Now I'm getting frustrated.\n\nThe next day I go to their \"main\" office (a different one from the small branch I went to the previous day) to try to get more information. They make a few phone calls and give me the same answer, wait for a letter in the mail, it will have details as well as my account officers name and contact information on it. Frustrating that I cannot get any information on my account and have no access to my money, but anyways I wait for the letter. \n\nA couple of days later I finally get a letter. No explanation, just that they had closed my account. The account officer to contact for questions? Elvis Pelvis. There was also no contact number. Needless to say I have switched banks. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VTXL7ha.png\n\nEdit with more information:\n\nThe bank is not some small bank. They have about 170 branches across Tennessee...I guess you could say it was the first one...\n\nI did take the letter into the manager at the main branch and showed her, asked her if this was some kind of joke. She said it looks like an error and would have her district manager call me. That was 2 weeks ago and never heard back. I did get a cashiers check for the remaining balance in the account, the biggest issue was not being able to access my money for a few days, and wondering what was going to happen with my direct deposit paycheck since my account was no longer open. Still don't have a reason why they closed my account. \n\nAlso, I have open cases with the FDIC and BBB. Not that I expect anything from it now that I have my money and the account is closed, but at least they are aware. ",

        "text": "I went out to pick up some burgers at a local tasty restaurant for my family.  I have never had a bad experience there before until now… \nGenerally, I do my best to be the nicest person when talking to anyone behind a register.  I have been there before and I feel like I can kind of relate to how bad their shift might be going, or the hell that they deal with on a daily basis.  Anyway, so I called ahead of time and arrived at local tasty restaurant to pick up my order.\n\n(I am me and E is employee)\n\n\nMe:  Hi, I’m here for a pickup please?\n\nE:  Pickup?  Sure no problem I can ring you up.\n\nSo there was no food on the counter when he rang me up.  In fact, he didn’t say anything about the food.  I didn’t ask because I did get there a few minutes early, so maybe it was still on the grill.  No problem.  I hand my card to Employee.\n\nE:  Just need you to sign here, oh and you don’t need to fill it out unless you’re going to TIP!\n\n(A little aggressive I thought, but I literally always tip, so why not.  So I tip.  I hand Employee the signed receipt, he hands me my order number, and I start sitting and waiting.)\n\nI sit and wait patiently.  For 5 minutes.  10 minutes.  15 minutes.  20 minutes.  It wasn't a big order at all.  Other people were coming in and picking up their orders with no issues, and their orders were much bigger than mine.  Then I stand up near the register and wait there.  Then I notice that people are coming in and making orders, and they are walking away with their food.  I’m not sure what the problem is.  I wait another 5 minutes, and then I approach the same Employee.\n\nE:  Hi do you need to make an order?\n\nMe:  No, I already paid… I’m waiting for my food. (I show my receipt) I’m here for a pick up.\n\nE:  Oh ok…..wait….so you haven’t ordered yet?  Or you did but you need to pay?\n\nMe:  No.  I paid you.  I have been waiting for my food for about 30 minutes now…\n\nE:  …OH!  … what is the name?\n\nMe: (name) \n\n(Employee 2 approaches)\n\nE:  (grabs my order off the back shelf) here you go. (The bag was there for a while...)\n\nE:  (says nothing after giving me my food)\n\nE2:  Wow… sorry about that.  \n\nMe:  It’s okay.  It happens.  You guys were busy it’s all good… (I make an excuse)\n\nE2:  No… that wasn’t busy at all.  Sorry.\n\nIn the end, E just forgot about me.  In my mind I think a few things:  \nWhen I tip you, I feel like it would be nice for you to remember who I am after I have paid you.\nWhen I don’t tip you, please still try to remember who I am?\nI'll still go back because I like the food, but I will think twice about tipping now...\n\n\n\n",
