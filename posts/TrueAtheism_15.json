        "text": "Hello everyone. Just discovered this subreddit and figured it would be a good place to ask. I dropped Christianity a long time ago and been better for it and don't regret it. However as I thought about the nature of morality I start to get concerned. \n\nThe whole heaven and hell thing as a reward for doing good seemed wrong and not what true morality is about. If the only thing keeping a person from performing evil acts is the threat of eternal damnation then that person is not truly moral I believe.\n\nBut after doing a lot of thinking (I do this way too much thanks to a severe case of OCD) and with some philosophical reading, I noticed a problem about secular morality too. It seems to me that secular morality is also just a carrot and stick type of deal. My reasoning for this is because without morality, or at least appearing to be moral, society would fall apart. I think the philosopher Thomas Hobbes said it best. Without morality life would be short and brutal.\n\nMy problem with this though is it seems to me to be the same thing as reward and punishment like religious morality. We are only moral in order to keep society going. The reason why this bothers me so much because I have always believed that there is more to morality then just reward and punishment. We shouldn't be coerced into doing the right thing, we should WANT to do the right thing because it is a good thing.\n\nBut every ethical secular theory I read spouts the same content it seems. The reason why morality exist is because of the social contract. But this to me is not enough for a basis of morality.\n\nThe Ring of Gypse from Plato's Republic is a challenge to morality that deeply concerns me. Brief recap if you don't know the story, a man discovers a magical ring that allows him to be invisible. Realizing he could get away with anything without any repecussions, he seduces the queen of the kingdom and murders the king and takes over the kingdom.\n\nThe moral issue the story raises is, why be moral if one can get away with it with no negative consequences. This question disturbed me greatly and shook my moral beliefs and caused me many sleepless nights to this day, as I realized, that I had no answer.\n\nI am not a murderer or rapist or thief and I have no inclination to be any of those things. But the idea that I was unable to justify why one should not do those things beyond fear of negative consequences shook my beliefs hard. For if one was a \"sensible knave\" as David Hume calls them, they would appear to be moral when it benefits them to gain a good reputation but then turn around and commit immoral acts when they believe they could get away with it. How would you convince this person to follow to be good to their fellow man? \n\nI think of all the people who live immoral lives and live consequence free and seem to lead a good life. It makes me question the very value of morality and why one should be good. Why be good if the immoral life is in my self interest? Why should I not indulge in ethical egoism and hedonism? \n\nI always had a belief that being a good person was the the best way to live life and that morality was objective in a way. I was an ethical realist. I rejected moral nihilism. The people who go around and do harm to others do not deserve to have a good life. And yet it seems that they often get away with it. In that case why should one care about their fellow man? Why should one be moral and reject evil acts? Why should one not pursue their self interest if they are able to escape the consequences?\n\nI think I rambled enough. This post is already way too long and I don't even know if anyone will bother to read it and those of you that do will probably think me pathetic. And you would probably be right. At the end of the day my question is this. What reason do secular people have for being moral outside of a social contract theory of ethics? Is that really all morality boils down to?  I hate myself for even asking these questions but in my messed up mind I don't know how to justify morality without a reward punishment system.",

It just seems like jerk off material for people who are already Christian. Like in GND, the movie tells people to text others saying God's not dead. They want to spead tbe message, but it is just unpalatable for those who aren't Christian.\n\nNow, there are movies that are really good, even popular in the mainstream that happpen to have strong Christian themes. Movies like \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" or \"The Lord of the Rings.\"  So many people are fans of these movies and books. They have become classics in their own right.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or diagree, and why? Hopefully, I make sense.",

        "text": "[Here's the link](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/08/shadi_hamid_on_islamic_exceptionalism.html). It's an interview and the interviewee appears to be a westernized moderate Muslim who writes about such topics as in my title. He's basically saying that Islam isn't compatible with Liberalism because there are certain areas that won't be up for debate: it hasn't been secularized like Xianity and Judaism. They cover a variety of topics though. At least one intriguing question made me think: Should Liberalism be the final evolution of all modern states? I guess the only thing \"better\" from a Liberal viewpoint would be a benevolent dictatorship, which is quite fraught with potential abuse.\n\nIt got me thinking though about other failed Democratic states where the real problem was lack of education of the populace. This lack of education makes them vulnerable to manipulation and prevents a real participation in improving the country. I would argue that Islam is the reason for the lack of education so it is secondarily responsible for failed states. Since Islam, I believe, is against liberal education such as history, any philosophy that might run counter to islam, etc... it seems that they are doomed to falling to the extremists in any country where actual Islamists take over. This is in contrast to Saudi Arabia, where I think religion is consciously being used as a tool by the rulers but they themselves are somewhat immune to extremist positions themselves.\n\nI wonder if any Muslim leaders see this pattern (assuming I'm correct) and will be able to change.",

It got me thinking of actually dedicating a certain amount of time each week to reading the Quran to hopefully get a better understanding of this.\n\nI know this is pretty open ended, but my question is, has anyone else done this?  Was it worth your time?  What were your impressions?\n\nBonus questions: have you read any other holy texts?  Bible, Bhagavad Gita, Book of Mormon?  Thoughts?",

        "text": "A while ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/4vj2n1/my_mother_thinks_shes_a_prophet/), detailing a more negative aspect of my experience with Christianity. The TL;DR of that post is that my mom took religious fanaticism to a whole new level, and I, who had slowly been creeping toward atheism, was pretty miserable having to be around it all the time. \n\nNot that it really matters to anyone, but I wanted to share some of my more positive feelings during that time. If you don't really care to read on, then consider this post just a place where I can put some thoughts I've wanted to express for a while now.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've always been very into fantasy, science fiction, super heroes, all that good stuff. I spent all my childhood doing nothing but playing video games and watching cartoons, which inspired me to draw. I *loved* drawing. I loved getting lost in my own personal fantasy worlds. It's safe to say it was my whole life, really. \n\nAround the age of 10, I developed a massive anxiety disorder. Being the age I was, and my mother, being pretty ignorant of anything close to scientific, didn't fully understand what was happening. My mom did in fact identify it as anxiety, but her solution, of course, was a daily dose of the Jesus. It didn't really help, but for the next few years, I had convinced myself it was helping, and thus I lived my life as a very extreme Christian. \n\nIn retrospect, those years were the worst of my life so far, and very well might be for as long as I live. Not only was I desperately clinging to a religion that wasn't even helping my anxiety, I had basically signed over my rights to everything I loved overnight. Keep in mind that my breed of Christianity was a very conservative, literalist one. Any mere mention of magic, even in a fictional medium, was cause for alarm. So I gave it all up. Call it a sort of pact with God, if you will. Something to show Him that I was truly devoted, if He'd only take away my pain. I lived my life craving the fantasy worlds I used to let myself sink into. Somehow, my brain has, and still is, just naturally oriented toward that sort of thing. It gravitates toward it all on its own, and the fact that I had to essentially wrap chains around those feelings all that time left me miserable. Not to mention the sexual repression. *Right* as I entered puberty, I was made to feel like my desire to masturbate, or even have sexual thoughts at all, was unnatural, and for that alone I deserved to suffer with my anxiety. \n\nFast forward into my late teenage years, when all the events in [the aforementioned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/4vj2n1/my_mother_thinks_shes_a_prophet/) took place. I had been teetering between serious doubts and full on atheism for some time at that point. In the post, I focus a lot on how miserable I felt having opened pandora's box in my household. It was truly a disgusting feeling, but honestly, it wasn't all bad. While all that was going on, I finally regained the courage to start embracing my real desires again. I started picking up all the old fantasy games. It was the first time I had read Lord of the Rings and The Dark Tower series by Stephen King; I had replaced my bedside Bible with a copy of *The Hobbit.* It was also the same time I discovered my love for rock music, and last but not least, I could finally explore my sexuality without feeling guilty over it. I even made some friends in school who were also into that sort of thing. I would take hikes in the woods and digest everything I had been taking in. It was a beautiful feeling and a healthy escape from my home life. \n\nFor anyone into \"geek culture\" (I kind of hate that word), you're probably aware of the recent wave of nostalgia that's been going on. All of the old Nintendo games from the 80s and 90s had started to gain back their popularity around that time, and it was the first time I got a chance to try out all the ones I never got to. My friend had gifted me his Wii for Christmas, and I immediately took advantage of the fact that I could now buy digital downloads of all the old classics. It was the first time I had played the original Legend of Zelda, not to mention Ocarina of Time. It was the first time I had played the original Final Fantasy. I even picked up my old Game Boy and started playing my old Pokemon games, what with all their devilish teachings of evolution (lol). There was a lot left to the imagination with such simplistic graphics, and to someone who was just rediscovering his own imagination, I couldn't ask for more. Forgive the cheesiness, but \"magical\" really is the best word to describe the feeling. I was finally allowed to make up for all the lost childhood that had been robbed from me. For at least one last time, I could be a kid again. \n\nWhile I was allowing myself to be a kid again, I was finally entering into a healthy form of adulthood as well. I was finally able to actually *touch* my girlfriend without feeling guilty. I was able to do something as simple as have sexual fantasies without thinking that God would punish me with crippling anxiety. I was able to date around, explore what I liked, and get the healthy life experience I was afraid to get before. To this day, I'm still trying to piece together that aspect of my life. I've come a long way and learned a lot, but I've still got a way to go. Better late than never, though. \n\nLooking back during the not-so-bad parts of my life now, I remember everything quite fondly. While it was also very miserable, I look at that period as a personal renaissance of sorts, and the period right before it as the Dark Ages. It truly was like the best part of me had begun to revive and see the light of day again. Even now that my life is much better in comparison to that time, I always look back on the tail-end of my teenage years with reverence. After all those years with my nose in a Bible, it was the first time I actually felt reborn. ",

        "author": "needstechhelp7",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/4xxntv/the_caesars_messiah_theory/",
        "text": "Awhile back, an author made the argument that the origins of Christianity where largely something made by the roman empire some 2000 years ago during the so called time of jesus. Having gone through his research and material's, I find the theory rather difficult to refute given that most of it just makes plain sense. The part I found a little difficult had to do with how gnostism was originally a sort of \"counter-hijack\" to the messianic movement which had been hijacked by the roman's to have a pacifist effect on the Hebraic people, as militaristic campaigns where ultimately in effective.\n\nAs it stands, the author seems to have fallen victim to the \"quack\" label, but with no real justification as people who tend to refute his theory either use the bible, or a series of round about logic that say's something like \"the romans where not that smart\". From the research I have read that tries to refute it such as an article by robert price, none of it actually seems to be able to refute it in entirety because it ignores much of the evidence atwill show's.\n\nIn part, what I also am trying to say is that \"gods\" are also a sort of made up figure or figures to accomplish various geopolitical-economic goals, which would seem to be the point with alot of what comes out of the middle east area in particular. What seems to strike me more about the Caesars messiah theory is that it strikes at the core identity of alot of the western world, though for whatever reason it doesnt seem to work on me. \n\nI feel going in the caesar's messiah theory ultimately requires one take it a step farther in research. What I have found in various sources is that while there where people in the \"israel/judah\" area at the time, they generally are not what is thought. Its quite possible most of these people are actually just egyptians with something of a canaanite/summerian that manages to take over a core aspect of egyptian religion and create an offshort which later become judaism, and that the founder of this isnt actually moses, but akhenaten, who in turn may also be Dionysus. It can be difficult to say what may or may not be true at this time and what comes out of this area, but from what it seems, most of it is just surprisingly human with far less the fantastic supernaturalism which has become the core at alot of the identity of much of the world.\n\nUpdate:\n\n\nI gave numerous replies to wackyvorlon and schad501 to which case their replies became largely argumentative and defensive. I dont intend on reply to them any longer given the number of blanket statements on there half and wish that the reader of this post simply do research for his/her own conclusion.\n\nIf you wish to point of inconsistencies and errors, please refrain from blanket statements and show scholarly source material, and such critical points. I wont reply to blanket statements.\n\n",

I played along with more skill than the other atheists there,  however. \n\nI'm fairly well read in apologetics and counter apologetics. I have watched a fair number of debates and I consume almost Christian media as atheist media. I like to read.

Intelligent,  I think. He called himself simply a a Christian and it took me a little coaxing for him to confirm my suspicions that he's a born again Evangelical. He goes to one of the hip, trendy churches whose conservative theology is hidden by coffee shops and expert use of technology. \n\nThree weeks later he sends me this message: Hi, this is Joel, the Christian that attended the atheist brunch a few weeks ago.

        "text": "Awhile back I made a post requesting your thoughts on a group of Christians who believe things like election and predestination (if your not an elect then you have no hope of escaping hell). Having listened to them for a few months now I have figured a few things out. They really hate the church system and say it's adherents are reprobates. They also claim the spirit of God speaks to them not only through the Bible but to them directly. Thirdly they also believe the \"true\" believers are scattered all around the world and are the persecuted minority. Well recently they have been going on about 2 Thessalonians 2. They believe we are at this point in time in which Satan will reveal himself and rule over the world for awhile then Jesus will come and rule for thousand years then anyone who is not an elect will be cast into the lake of fire. (Sounds nice doesn't it). It's interesting though because I'm trying to figure this all out. How can they all be on the same page if there is not authority teaching them like a pastor. They seem to credit this to God teaching them and telling them the truth about what is really going on. I'd like to hear your opinions on this. Is it really god teaching them? Or is there a logical explanation for all of this.\n\nSide note: It should be noted they say things like \"only a child of God can understand the Bible\" and \"Logic is useless when trying to understand god\".",

The 12,000 year old civilization in Turkey. There are very interesting discussions happening with certain geologists (E.g. Randall Carlson) that extinction level events occurred roughly 11,600 years ago. And perhaps the evidence suggesting this temple was buried on purpose (As it was very well reserved) was because of this event? (Graham Hancock, although not a scientist, has done some great journalism on the topic). I don't know how solid the information that the temple was aligned to certain stars, as Graham claims. But it's certainly interesting to wonder what happened to these civilizations, and what religions did they have etc. \n\n\n\n",

The religious would then claim that I have \"faith\" that the universe is 13.8 billion years old because I rely on reports that scientists have performed these experiments and validated/replicated them amongst themselves.\n\n\n\nTheists would then claim that this is the same way their faith works, no they may not have seen miracles performed or seen Jesus's resurrection but they have faith in their books, religious leaders or the feeling that they get when they pray.\n\nI have a strong feeling that these two examples are not comparable but cannot find a succinct concrete response.

If not Atheism, in what ways is it different? Also, I'd like to hear some criticisms of this belief. Here's the full post:**\n\n\"I’m studying physics and have a major bent towards science, so I’m constantly thinking about how the world works. Physics is a beautiful language to quantitatively and conceptually describe and predict the world around us, but it doesn’t tell us why the world exists in such a way that it can even be predictable. From class or observation, I can tell you what’s going to happen if you throw a ball. I can even tell you exactly where that ball is going to be at any given time, when it will hit the ground, how far it will go, how much energy it will lose, etc. I can show you the formulas, I can show you the math that derives those formulas,but I can’t explain to you why the universe is so faithful to these formulas.Why – if you go to Mars, Jupiter, or a whole other star system – the universe will always and forever uphold the math and logic that led to those formulas. For this reason, many physicists believe that God is whatever that thing is that upholds the laws of Physics irrespective of space or time; God is what faithfully and impartially enforces these laws. I buy into this a little bit,but I just don’t know enough to know what I don’t, so I wouldn’t call myself a believer. For this reason, I became interested in how other cultures and civilizations coped with what I’ll call the “God problem,” and the social,economic, and cultural forces that shaped their solution. I really didn't like anything I read, so for now I guess I'll just be ok with beliving that God is what faithfully and impartially enforces the laws of the universe. If anyone has anything better I'd love to hear about it.\"",

        "text": "Quick background: I am a devout former Christian turned atheist; transition happened when I was a teenager. Lived in a very conservative Christian household most of my life. My explicit denial of religion caused a lot of tension between me and my mother that persists to this day.\n\nWhen I was about 16, my mom (extremely religious; Pentecostal Christian) called me into the living room one day. She had been hunting around for an RV to rent for herself and several other people to go down to a church thing out of state. I knew she was religious, but what she told me that day had me floored. She called me into the living room to announce to me that she was a \"prophet.\" Yes, that is the word she used.\n\nShe went on to describe the evidence for this by telling me about how God had led her to the perfect RV (turned out to be a piece of junk that literally started falling apart on the way there, including a door. She wrote this off as a test of faith) that He intended for her to find, evidence being these vague \"visions\" she had as she was searching. For example, she said as she was driving around an unfamiliar city and had a vision of \"flashes of green,\" and later, she ended up driving by a body of water that was apparently very green. Things like that. \n\nIn the months to come, she would call me in with similar stories and instances, more specifically, supposed divinely inspired dreams she had been having. Later I found out that she had been keeping stacks of college-rule notebooks full of these dreams. During a huge mental breakdown that was sparked by finding out that my step-dad had been cheating on her, she actually got some of them out and started reading through them out loud obsessively with trembling hands. None of them seemed to make any sense (like most dreams) or have any obvious lead-in to the knowledge that my step-dad had been cheating. One such dream apparently involved her dancing with my sister's boyfriend in her closet, or something to that effect. Apparently, this was a clear sign that should have tipped her off to my step-dad's fooling around, as it was \"the same old song and dance\" as the problems in her marriage.\n\nWhat I'd really like to talk about here is my feelings about all of this. In spite of my current rejection of religion, what she said caused me a lot of fear. Not necessarily because I saw that my mom was slipping into insanity, but rather because what if, in spite of any reasonable doubt, she was right. What if she *was* a prophet? What if the God, whom I now perceived as a mad tyrant, really existed? I never realized what freedom felt like until I walked away from Christianity, and I was scared to death that the shackles were about to be placed back on me. That's what terrified me, and I do mean terrified. To this day, it's very hard for me to speak to my mom at all. She cannot have a conversation with me without bringing this sort of thing up. She just can't. Every time we try to talk, within no less than 5 minutes she will try to sneak in some prophecy that she's recently had. \n\nWhat scares me the most, even now, is that some of them seemed somewhat accurate. I think logically it's much easier to conclude that it's all a bunch of shit and my mom has just lost her mind, but things like a prediction of my uncle's death, my brother breaking his ankle due to a sports injury, the fact that my mom and grandma, who supports this whole prophet thing, have apparently had correlating dreams that line up with exact detail. I can't confirm or deny the validity of this, but they swear it's true. Maybe it's the shock of the fact that it's my own mother, maybe I really am just that terrified of any small possibility that this God might be real, but to this day it shakes me up a bit. It was so bad I had to move out of state with my dad. I've been living with him the last 4 years with minimal contact with my mom ever since.\n\nI'd like to leave by saying how much I wished I knew about a place like this. I wanted nothing more than to have people reassure me that I wasn't the one who was crazy and that I had nothing to fear. But I guess better late than never. I just can't express how surreal it was when everyone around me thought *I* was the crazy one. It was like some twisted Jesus-themed funhouse that I couldn't get away from. Anyway, thank you for listening if you actually read the whole thing. I appreciate finally being heard. \n\n**TL;DR:** My mom thinks she's a prophet and has allegedly divinely inspired dreams to support this claim. It scares me a lot. ",

To paraphrase, she said that most people who say they believe in religions don't *really* believe in them, or they would adhere to them as closely as possible. After all, there is an eternity after this relatively negligible existence. This is much more credible when applied to those who say they are \"non-practicing [Muslims/Christians],\" because in their own view, their practices do not align with what they purport to believe. \n\nThis leaves open a few possibilities:\n\n1. They don't necessarily believe or disbelieve and haven't been forced to give it much thought, so they just go along with it to the extent necessary to not create social tension and/or not result in a fate any worse than what those around them will face. \n\n2. They don't believe it at all and are knowingly lying to protect themselves, or they mean that they identify culturally with others who consider themselves followers of the religion, but they don't believe in the actual religion. \n\n3. They believe that certain practices are preferable to the religion, but believe that they can ultimately somehow BS their way to a nice afterlife. \n\n4. They really think that they will go to hell if they don't \"practice,\" but like smokers who continue to smoke, they continue not practicing. This analogy is problematic, still; smokers continue to smoke despite the health risks because they are health *risks*; if it were a guarantee that lung cancer would result after this pack of cigarettes, any non-suicidal person would not smoke it. In line with this analogy, it would follow that this non-practicing religious person feels uncertain about their beliefs. \n\n5. They believe that they will spend an eternity in hell and find temporary satisfactions to be worth it. (This seems incredibly unlikely to me.)\n\nI'm sure I missed a few others.

Taken to an extreme, this can lead to literalist belief, such as belief in talking snakes, that people can live inside of whales and killing infants can be justified (Hosea 13:16, 1 Samuel 15:3 and Psalm 137:9).\n\n2) Religious beliefs often include ritualistic dogma. Circumcision, baptisms, naming conventions, marriage ceremonies, fasting and dietary restrictions, dress restrictions and hygienic practices are all common. Although many of these may not directly cause harm, they generally needlessly consume time and resources. Some are directly harmful, such as drinking poison, snake handling or genital mutilation.\n\n3) Myths and falsehoods are often taught as religion. Creationism and the \"Great Flood\" have been disproved for hundreds of years, yet those beliefs continue to be common (46% of Americans believe the earth was created in the last 10,000 years,^2 and 60% believe in the literal Great Flood^3 .) Historically, it took an equal amount of time to dispel the incorrect idea that the sun is the center of the solar system and that earth does not move. Other examples include the inferiority of women and unfounded dangers of psychology. A particularly damaging example is the concept that mankind was kicked out of Eden, which implies the earth is a prison, and does not deserve to be respected.\n\n4) Religious teachings often lead to absolute morality. Homosexuality, divorce, abortion, stem-cell research are issues commonly condemned with no justification aside from religious teachings. Absolute ideals not only lead to fanaticism, but are unrealistic in a complicated modern society.\n\n5) Religious doctrine often include to not question religion. Abrahamic religions teach that mankind is literally punished and suffer disease and death due to thinking. The failure to teach thinking skills and independent thought lead to black and white thinking in all aspects of life, such as immigration is good/bad, lower/higher taxes results in a better/worse economy or guns cause/prevent crime. This also leads to a general avoidance of solving root causes of difficult social problems, and instead focuses on symptoms (such as “guns cause crime”). The issue is not the opinion, it is feeling entitled to advocate an opinion held without support.\n\n6) Religion provides a shield against counter-arguments on any range of issues. Religious opinions cover such diverse topics as clothing, homosexual rights, corporate personhood and health care. People claim religion as a shield, by claiming if their political beliefs are challenged, that their religion is not being respected and under attack. This is, in essence, a claim to greater right to speech based on religion. Religion has been used to defend slavery, racial segregation, sexual discrimination, discrimination against homosexuals, protection of gun rights, \"pro-life\" movement, both for and against capital punishment, denying scientific research (in general and in specific areas), limits on contraceptives, limits on health insurance, and many other diverse topics.\n\n7) Religious authority figures are given respect as subject-matter experts in everything. If you want to know about particle physics, people would naturally trust the answers of a physicist over a soy-bean farmer. However, on the topic of planting crops, you would naturally trust the farmer over the physicist. People have developed an innate ability to weigh the reliability of the source of information. However, ministers skew this reaction, despite not having subject matter expertise. People often ask the opinion of religious leaders about parenting, marriage, philosophy, sociology, etc. Aside from receiving potentially bad counseling advice or misinformation, ministers can unduly influence politics. 82% of evangelical Republicans believe it's an obligation to vote Republican.^4 As an extreme example, people have given millions to Billy Graham based solely on his claim that God needed the money.\n\n8) Religions lead to a huge consumption of resources. In the U.S., there are nearly three times the number of churches than gas stations.^5 In addition, $93 billion is donated to churches per year.^6 Church attendance consumes another $39+ billion per year in manpower.^7 It could not be overstated the effect this money and resources would have combating homelessness, hunger or even unemployment. (Imagine what could be accomplished if the vast majority of people volunteered one hour every week, with $93 billion per year in resources!)^8\n\n9) Religions create groupings of people along arbitrary lines. While people have historically grouped by race, politics, language, economic status, and other methods, religion creates a false grouping. Religion allows divisions among peoples where there is no discernible difference aside from being indoctrinated to seemingly minor differences in interpretations of a holy book. While at times, this can be a good thing, inclusion tends to be based on extremely narrow beliefs, which leads to reinforcing segregation along both ethnic and socio-economic lines.\n\n10) Religions create groupings of people with false ideals, such as those who are misogynist^9 or anti-homosexual. This allows self-validation for ideas that are otherwise self-serving, with little or no societal benefit. This distorts political policies and restrains the advancement of society. Examples include Westboro Baptist and the KKK.\n\n11) Religions tend to being judgmental in general, with the Judaic religions particularly bad. It is built into most religions at a fundamental level. Those who are outside, are inherently bad, and will go to hell. Atheists, despite being proportionately less likely to commit crimes^9 and proportionally more educated^10 , are less trusted than even rapists.^11 ^12 In general, it helps to create and maintain an idea that people are bad, or people have bad traits, rather than people's actions leading to harm.\n\n12) Belief in an after-life is extremely common among religions. This teaches people to not only postpone enjoyment, it also provides people with an excuse not to help those in need, due to the concept that if they deserve help, they will receive it after they die. In extreme cases, this can lead to martyrdom, such as the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and suicide attacks on abortion clinics. Conversely, a belief in a punishment during the afterlife can lead to an extreme fear of death (which in turn can distort politics, particularly with health care).\n\n13) Apocalyptic prophecies have much the same effect, but leads to ignoring generational problems. If the world is going to end, then people see no need to prevent or repair difficult problems, such as protecting the environment,^13 conserving resources (also see #3, Eden myth) or investing in long-term research.\n\n^1 [Kathleen Corriveau, et. al.](http://www.bu.edu/learninglab/files/2012/05/Corriveau-Chen-Harris-in-press.pdf ); Judgements About Fact and Fiction by Children From Religious and Nonreligious Backgrounds [PDF] - children raised with Christian religious beliefs are less able to differenciate between fact and fantasy\n\n^2 Gallop, 2010\n\n^3 [ABC, 2004](http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/947a1ViewsoftheBible.pdf)\n\n^4 [U.S. News, 2013](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2013/07/23/poll-shows-republicans-divided-by-tea-party-evangelicals-and-moderates).\n\n^5 345K churches - [Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies](http://www.rcms2010.org/press_release/ACP%2020120501.pdf), 2010 and 121K gas stations - US Census Bureau, 2012\n\n^6 Giving USA Foundation, 2010\n\n^7 This is ONLY considering adults who are actively employed (and ignoring children and the “self-employed”). 41% attend church at least once per week, Gallop 2010.

        "title": "Why we should not \"tax churches\"",
        "author": "BaronVonCrunch",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/4usaey/why_we_should_not_tax_churches/",
        "text": "EDIT: I welcome any responses and discussion, but please *read* this before responding to it.\n\nI wrote this as a comment some time back, but I want to resurrect it (with significant edits/additions) as a post, because I think it is important to recognize some of the difficulties with a view that seems to be popular among atheists. \n\nPeople often say \"tax churches\" without getting into the details of how it would work.  The answer is: it would not work.\n\n**First**, Churches are 501c3 organizations, just like most non-profit organizations. Museum? 501c3. Charitable foundation? 501c3. Barry Manilow Appreciation Society? 501c3 (or c4 or c7). Think tank? 501c3. Bowling League? 501c3. There are many [different kinds of 501c organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501\\(c\\)_organization), but 501c3 is by far the most common.\n\nIf you want to tax churches, then you have to tax all of those other organizations. \n\nBut surely, you might assume, we could just single out churches, right? Wrong. \n\nFor one thing, defining \"church\" is difficult. The minute you say churches cannot be c3 organizations, what is to stop them from simply calling themselves something else? Throw a few paintings on the wall and they're an art museum. Read the Bible now and then and they're a literary club. Provide information about how to live a better life and they're an educational organization. Get together a couple days a week and they are a social club. If you make it taxable to call themselves a \"church\", they can just call themselves something else. \"I know it when I see it\" is not a good basis for policy. \n\n**Second**, singling out churches for taxation could not pass constitutional muster. The 1st amendment prohibits the government from creating laws that favor or disfavor, endorse or oppose, religion(s). Prohibiting organizations from obtaining legal non-profit status *on the basis of religion* is precisely the kind of thing the 1st amendment prohibits. \n\nIf you eliminated (legislatively) non-profit status for all c3 organizations, that would be legal. But making a rule that disfavors religious organizations *because they are religious organizations*? Yeah, no chance. That would be a blatant, explicit violation of the 1st amendment.\n\n**Third**, as atheists, we should be glad the government cannot do this, because a government that can legally disfavor religious organizations for tax purposes is a government that can legally discriminate against atheists on the basis that they are atheists.\n\n**Finally**, let's remember that \"non-profit\" mostly just means the organizations revenue does not unduly inure to the benefit of individuals or owners. It means they don't have profits that get distributed to executives or shareholders. That doesn't mean people cannot earn a salary, even a very good salary. They can...and they have to pay taxes on those salaries, too, just like other c3 organizations. A lot of the super-wealthy pastors you see are earning a lot of their money independently of the church itself, via books and speeches and things like that. They pay taxes on that income. What they don't pay taxes on is the non-existent \"profits\", because churches do not, in legal/accounting terms, have profits. They have revenue, maybe even a lot of revenue, but revenue and profit are not the same thing. \n\n**So, what could be done?** \n\nThere are a couple *legally* feasible changes that could be made. Whether they are politically feasible, or good policy, may be another matter. \n\n* **Property taxes**: The Supreme Court has ruled (in 1970) that State/local property tax exemptions for churches are not unconstitutional, insofar as churches are just one class of public [welfare](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/social-welfare-purposes) or [charitable](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-purposes) organizations (see links for definitions), but that does not mean that they are legally *required*. It might be possible to eliminate the broad property or sales tax exemption, but this would need to be done *for all exempt non-profit organizations*. Legally, it is feasible. But politically? Good luck getting legislators to impose taxes not only on churches, but also on non-profit universities, museums and hospitals. \n\n* **Form 990**: The major advantage churches have over other non-profit organizations is an exemption from filing annual 990's. This is more difficult to justify as a legal matter (why churches but not museums?), a practical matter (how do you verify legal compliance?) and as a moral matter (why resist accountability/transparency?).  FFrF filed suit a few years ago to get the IRS to require churches to file 990's, but the [suit was dismissed for lack of standing](http://www.ecfa.org/Content/Federal-Lawsuit-Pressing-Churches-to-File-Form-990-Fails-on-Standing) in 2014. Churches (and [the federal government](http://www.ecfa.org/Documents/News/Brief%20in%20Support%20of%20Motion%20to%20Dismiss%20\\(12-CV-946\\).pdf)) argue that these filing requirements would pose a \"burden on religious practice.\"  Of course, the characteristics associated with \"[church](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/churches-religious-organizations/churches-defined)\" are not religion-specific, and so this exemption [would also apply](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/20/atheist-religion-tax-breaks/2678367/) to an atheist \"church.\" One of the obvious problems with religious freedom issues is the difficulty in defining many of the terms and the understandable reluctance of courts and the IRS to wade into such a poorly defined but constitutionally protected area with strong opinions. While it may be difficult, this seems like the most viable legal and political path for more equitable tax treatment of churches. It won't impose any taxes on them, but it would at least hold them to the same legal standards as other 501c organizations.\n\n**tl;dr**: Taxing churches is is a bad idea on constitutional and practical levels. You don't have to like what they stand for or agree with what they do to recognize that churches are (aside from the 990 issue) just like any other c3 organization, and that protecting churches from discrimination is critically important to protecting atheist organizations from discrimination.",

        "text": "My in-laws like to send me religious articles in an effort to get a rise. Sometimes I let it go without a response, and other times I can't resist. The last one I brought to you guys was about laminin and how its shape is proof of intelligent design (lol).  Yesterday they sent me an article from breakpoint.org, a popular Christian site whose mission states \"In an increasingly hostile, secular culture, Christians are faced with issues and choices we’ve never had to deal with before. BreakPoint is here to help believers of every denominational background develop a robust Christian worldview—seeing, understanding, and engaging the world from a biblical perspective.\" Barf. \n\nAnyways, the article in question is written by Eric Metaxas - a quick search on Patheos reveals a lot about his predictably crazy work - and it's on a Big Think video by Bill Nye. Here's the link to the article in question (it's short):\nhttp://www.breakpoint.org/bpcommentaries/entry/13/29603\n\nMetaxas takes issue with Nye's less than enthusiastic stance on philosophy. Do you guys agree with Nye that the value in philosophy is very limited? Or does the author make a good point, that one without the other is a waste of time. Is science \"impossible\" without it, like Metaxas says?\n\nThis guy is obviously coming at it with his Christian colored glasses on. In general, I think Metaxas is arguing that science without religion (his philosophy) is meaningless, that they are non-overlapping magisteria as Gould would say. Personally I think that's b.s. because the epistemologies they use are so diametrically opposed that they can't coexist. Jerry Coyne has written some good pieces on this. \n\nWhile I don't want to send back to my in-laws a defense of Bill Nye, because I don't really care abut Bill Nye, I think there are some cringe worthy parts of the article that are worth rebutting:\n\n\"Modern inferences like the laws of gravity, optics, and Newtonian physics only make sense if you assume an orderly and consistent universe—the kind of universe the Judeo-Christian Bible says we have.\"\n\n\"Christianity gave birth to modern science by laying this philosophical groundwork. That is to say, the Christian worldview, alone in the history of mankind, made the right claims about reality necessary for empirical science to develop and flourish.\"\n\n\"So ironically, philosophy is alive and well, even in the thinking of atheist scientists, whether they admit it or not. And let’s remember that despite the protestations of Nye, Hawking, Dawkins and the like, that it’s thanks to philosophy—and the Christian worldview—that the sun rose on modern science in the first place.\"\n\nThose are cringe worthy. do you guys have any advice or paths for rebuttal that I should take here? Modern science owes all it has to Christianity? Give me a break. The laws of nature only make sense when viewed in a Judeo-Christian lense? It's like we're living on different planets here. \n\nThanks for considering and any help you may offer. \n",

        "text": "Let's look at that statement another way. I have struggled with this idea and have posted about it. Now I am going to try to frame it another way. This is more pertinent to those who are formerly religious and feel lost without an ultimate purpose.\n\nImagine if on your thirteenth birthday your parents sat you down and explained to you why you existed. Before you were born your parents decided they needed someone to look after them in their old age. They explain that your entire purpose is to serve them while they are alive, serve others afterwards, and to hold vigil to their memory after their death. Your dream to be an artist, to explore the Arctics and Amazon, and find a partner were stupid childhood fantasies. You are to push aside your own wants and desires and wait on them to serve them in this life and the next. You might think it is unfair or that some of what they want doesn't seem like a moral or fruitful use of your time, too bad. But that is the why of your creation. There is no doubt and no other answer as to why you were born.\n\nIf this sounds monstrous or unfair, take another look at the supposed meaning of your life that religion gave as an answer. As a former Catholic my ultimate reward for good behavior was to contemplate god for all eternity and awe in his glory. My purpose on earth was to serve God and spread his moral teachings so everyone can get to heaven. \n\nWas the meaning religion gave as an answer to the why of your life so pleasing that you frantically search for another outside source to tell you why you are here. Is another outside guide telling you why you exist really going to calm and fulfill you? Can another person or ideology supplant your own values in a way in which you will find peace? I am slowly beginning to grasp the often repeated axiom that you have to: create your own meaning\n\nIf that doesn't add up, please excuse the irony in being advised to not let others tell you the meaning of your life, but then being told the meaning of life is to \"create your own meaning.\" This post is a musing, not even a true thought experiment, and a bit of a caffeine fueled rant. It clearly is not a carefully considered philosophical argument.\n\nLet's try another thought: what would you do if there was a god who only created you for a single purpose. God entrusted you with one commandment as the whole meaning of your life and it was the only moral teaching. And God commanded you thus: Enjoy life. Be as happy and as fulfilled with life as you could possibly strive to be. Don't harm others in the process.\n\nThanks for reading.  Have a happy Sunday.",

I only told my immediate family though about my \"difficulty accepting catholicism at face value\" a couple years ago.  I never straight up told them I consider myself atheist.  \n\nThere are three things that upset me about this situation.  I'll break them down one at a time but they are: \n1. Them bringing religion into my home.\n2. Them starting discussions about my disbelief.\n3. Them assuming my involvement in \"family prayer\"\n\nBringing religion into my home:\n\nIt probably goes without saying that I live on my own now, I'm 100% independent financially, economically, geographically...whatever you want to call it.  I really don't give a shit what people want to think in their heads, or if they want to sit in the corner and mumble a rosary to themselves.  It does bother me though when we sit down to a meal at my table, and everybody refuses to start eating until someone (usually my mom or dad) says a prayer over the food.  Even if I take the initiation and start serving myself they will butt in with \"lets pray...in the name of the father....\" and I'm left there awkwardly holding a spoonful of food while everyone else is doing their thing.  Sometimes I fumble through it with them, lately I've just been sitting in silence for the 15 second duration.  Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but to me its a little insulting to me as a host that they seem to consider my efforts \"unacceptable\" until a vocal blessing has been said.  Same goes for when we go out to a restaurant somewhere.  I love taking my family out to eat when they visit, I make a decent income so I don't mind picking up the tab more often than not but it still feels as if to them thats not enough when they have to preface every meal with a prayer.\n\nStarting discussions about my disbelief:\n\nLike I said I told them about my \"doubts\" or \"crisis of faith\" or whatever a couple years ago.  I never flat out told them I was atheist.  I hear my family talking shit about \"godless people\" and the \"secular agenda\" all the time so I really have tried to avoid association, although its probably inevitable.  Anyways usually every time I visit them or they visit me at some point this subject comes up.  The question \"why don't you believe?\" or a variation is asked.  In my head, and to someone who is open minded its pretty easy to explain: I considered the claims of catholicism, theism, and the supernatural in general.  Based on my personal experience, observations, and public information I can to the conclusion that there is no suggestion that a supernatural does exist, that every argument for the existence of \"God\" is either not logically sound or so abstract as to have no meaning, and that the claims of catholicism are absolutely absurd.  Yes thats a mouthful, and I didn't do it all in one day, I examined these over the course of a few years during college.  The fact remains though, that while I understand my thoughts and reasons well, I cannot explain or convey them like a scholar.  I've read proofs and refutations for every argument, but I can't recall the refutation in completeness for any argument at any time.  Consequently, I don't always have a good answer/response for questions/statements that come up in these discussions.  I tell them that what they are saying doesn't make sense to me, or that its not reasonable, or that its simply not convincing.  I try to avoid personal attacks but really I'd like to just avoid the whole conversation.  The fact is I've made my decision, and barring me witnessing a miracle supplied by Jesus Christ himself before my very eyes or equivalent I am not going back to the catholic faith.  End of story.\n\nAssuming involvement in family prayer:\n\nThis one may be fading out already on its own.  I'm not sure.  my family was the type that in addition to going to church every sunday usually had \"family rosary\" and other \"family religious activities\" (e.g. confession, stations of the cross, church functions etc.).  Since I don't live with them obviously I don't really participate, but when I do visit its not like they just cease all activity.  When they go to mass I can either make a statement and not go, or go with them and have time at least during the trip to/from church and maybe at lunch after to talk and spend time with family, something I value a lot.  However when it comes to shit like a family rosary at home or something, I'm really not sure what to do.  I don't want to be part of it, I've just avoided \"leading\" any of the decades.  I'd really prefer to just not be included in the rosary though.  \n\nSo uhh... yea.  I'm really not sure where I'm going with this, but I've realized talking to my therapist that this is a big source of stress and tension in my life.  And it's causing me a lot of anxiety.  I want to fix these things that upset me by basically telling my family to \"fuck off, leave me out of your whacked religion.\"  At the same time my family is pretty much all I have right now, I only have a few friends and most of them live in other cities.  I'm not too good on the making new friends thing either, though I'm working on it.  I don't want to become \"the family atheist\" or any other kind of black sheep within the family.  I don't want to get treated differently or thought of negatively.  I know I can't really control how they will react to what I tell them or what they will think.  I really have no idea how they will react.  I don't think they will reject me from the family, but I do think that its just going to be...awkward for all of us.  \n\nIdk, I'm probably way overthinking it, but maybe not.  I just have no idea how to handle this.  Despite being a grown ass adult living on my own I can't see myself standing up to the family and directly stating what I think and what I want when it is so contrary to what I know they think/want.  At the same time, I know I have to eventually, otherwise most of the things that bother me will never change.\n\nTL:DR: I need to come out to my family as atheist",

My wife and I have been married 12 years and have 8 children. She is still young so our family will likely be much larger.\n\nWe are not alone. In our parish, we are the median. My wife's grandmother had 16 children and all but one married, and each of the married having 7+ children. Most are also traditionalists.\n\nIt doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure that, if other demographic groups do not compete, the face of our society will drastically change. Perhaps there is a trait that has emerged that gives evolutionary advantage to people who are also attracted to religious fundamentalism? What consensus is there in the secular and atheist communities?\n\nEdit: Corrected links.",

        "text": "There is a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/4th51k/certainty/) on the front page of this subreddit right now arguing that \"science can only speak of likelihoods and degrees of certainty.\" Since the ensuing discussion does not contest this claim, I infer that it is a widely held view here.\n\nThe denial that rational certainty is possible is self refuting, since that claim itself is being put forward as certain. Nor can one claim that it is merely put forward as \"highly probable,\" since in that case the claim that it is highly probable must itself be merely highly probable, and that claim in turn must be merely highly probable, and so on. The uncertainties in these successive claims must accumulate until the probability of the initial claim is virtually zero.\n\nCertainty refers to the absence of arbitrary doubt, not to the absence of irrational, groundless doubts like Descartes' demon. Such doubts have no cognitive content, since they are not based on evidence or reasoning, but only on an act of imagination. Walt Disney is not an objection to anything.\n\nCertainties can be refined when new, relevant factors are discovered, as when Newton's laws were refined by Einstein, but this is not a refutation of the old certainties. The old generalization was proven with certainty within the context of the evidence available at the time - all the evidence indicated that it was true, and there were no non-arbitrary objections. Claims proven by this standard will never really be refuted, only refined as new relevant factors and conditions are discovered.\n\nOnce we accept that rational certainty is possible, we are in a position to respond to the religious claim that science cannot yield the certainties and absolutes that they can allegedly achieve by faith, and mount a compelling defense of science and atheism.",

This means that He can do anything. And that means anything. He could, for example, create a square circle, or invert the curvature of space time or something equally unfathomable.\n\nAnyway, to the point I'm trying to make. I'm sure we are all familiar with the problem of evil. One of the ways that Christians and other theists try to dismiss the problem is by saying evil exists because we have free will. However, when we take the omnipotence if God info account, this actually doesn't make sense. Remember that God can do absolutely anything even if it defies logic or reason.\n\nWhat if He created the universe so we could have free will but were physically unable to do evil? He is omnipotent, so surely this would be possible.\n\nThis sounds absurd, and yet many of the other absurd things which an omnipotent and benevolent God would not allow are dismissed by theists since they claim that we cannot understand the nature of God. My argument, then, is that an omnipotent entity could do anything and it would mess up the traditional Christian response to the problem of evil.",

On some occasions I've seen the argument from miracles.  \n\nAnd whenever I point out that these arguments are not very good, I'm usually countered with the assertion that I actively disbelieve in a deity through faith, and am therefore not justified in my atheism.\n\nThere is an additional argument that \"weak atheism\" is either not a thing, or that it is actually strong atheism in some sort of disguise.

        "text": "I am in a correspondence with an evangelical Christian about Jesus' resurrection and claims about it. Here is my response to his arguments, talking about a Southwest plane crash which was reported by several news outlets. Each of the news outlets reported something different. This led to a conspiracy theorist claiming that the event didn't happen. My Christian acquaintance claims that the inconsistencies in the reports do not point to the event not having happened. He claims that we know what happened, regardless of the discrepancies in the eyewitness reports, and that any contradictions in them don't matter. I'm leaving his name out (If needed I'll call him Bob Smith the 50th, because reasons), but this is my response:\n \nYou are correct in saying that the inconsistencies in these personal anecdotes are not evidence against the events they claim to witness. However, it is far from conclusive evidence for the happening of and details of Jesus' resurrection or the Southwest plane crash. These two events are similar in the fact that the people who saw them disagreed on a great number of points; their testimony is most likely unreliable to construct an accurate report on what exactly happened. That's no surprise to me; we're only human. Nevertheless, the claim that a humanoid being stopped living, reanimated, and walked among humans again is fairly extraordinary. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; claims made without sufficient evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Word of mouth and inconsistent personal anecdotes are not nearly enough for me to accept the claim made here.\n \nThe comparison between the Southwest incident and the resurrection story is a false dichotomy. The plane crash incident is objectively verifiable through forensic evidence, photographic evidence, flight data, voice recordings of the crew and passengers during the flight and the incident, security cameras, and other forms of reliable, and not easily faked or fabricated records. The resurrection story has little concrete evidence, such as explanation of how Jesus' body died and came back to life again, through illustration of the mechanisms behind it, and a demonstration of the event itself through independent experimentation and demonstration. Beyond personal anecdotes, which have been shown to be written down for the first time at least 20 years after the event (the book of Mark), there is little concrete evidence of what is claimed to have happened in Jesus' time on earth. \n\n&gt; Chapter 5 – Diagon Alley\n&gt; On Harry's Hogwarts list of school supplies, \"1 Wand\" is listed twice, as both the first and last item on the list. This mistake was fixed in later editions of the book. The list of school supplies also doesn't include potion ingredients, although Harry later buys them.\n&gt; Harry has to buy Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them, but he doesn't start his Care of Magical Creaturesclasses until his third year. It is possible however, that the book may have been used for other classes.\n&gt; Harry buys the book One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, but later, he looks up dittany in \"One Hundred Magical Herbs and Fungi\". This error was, however, amended in later editions.\n&gt; The air in the tunnels to the Gringotts vaults is described as getting colder as they go deeper. This only happens very near the surface. Once you get below the level where the temperature depends heavily on the weather at the surface, the geothermal gradient takes over and it gets hotter as you go deeper.\n&gt; When Harry is talking to Hagrid about his first meeting with Draco Malfoy, Hagrid says that \"there's not a single witch or wizard who went bad that wasn't in Slytherin.\" At the point that this conversation takes place, Hagrid would have been under the impression that Sirius, a Gryffindor, was responsible for betraying Harry's parents. It is probable, however that Hagrid was merely exaggerating.\n&gt; When Harry returns from Diagon Alley to Little Whinging, he takes a train from Paddington Station. But Little Whinging is in Surrey, south of London, so he should have travelled from Victoria or Waterloo; trains from Paddington head to the west.\n&gt; \n\nHere's some words from [http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mistakes_in_the_Harry_Potter_books](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mistakes_in_the_Harry_Potter_books) which is a page on inconsistencies in the Harry Potter books. I'm using this as an example of literary problems/ inconsistencies and their place on the truth of the matter in question, as the story of the resurrection and the story of this wizard school are documented in literary form. \nSince these mistakes are not mutually exclusive, does it mean that the story itself is true? \nDoes Harry Potter's story itself have merit, in that it could have happend? \nDid Harry Potter exist?\nHarry Potter spends time in real places; in London, he visits Trafalgar Square, and King's Cross Station; their school is in the woodlands of the UK, he and his friends go to a wizard's sports world cup in Bulgaria. This is a character who visits real places, interracts with events in history, meets people, and can be read about in a series of books written by one person over several years after the fact. Does that make Harry Potter a real person? \nHow do we show that Harry Potter existed?\nHow do we show that Harry Potter didn't exist?\nWhere or to what do we turn to find the truth?\nhttp://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Azkaban \n\nI could use the Harry Potter books to say there is a large invisible wizard's prison in the North Atlantic that can't be seen by normal people; you can't prove me wrong because it's invisible to you and me. \n\nDoes that mean it exists because I can't be proven wrong? \nDoes that mean it doesn't exist because I can't be proven wrong about this claim?\nCan we say anything about this wizard's prison existing or not existing?\n\nI, personally, do not accept the claim that this wizard's prison exists in the North Atlantic.\nMy point that I'm trying to make is that the text itself is just a claim; to find what is really true, we must go to the source; the archaological evidence, the forensic evidence, video, pictures, experimental objective test results, and exhaustive investigation where needed. \n\nThe existence of this wizard's prison, is, I admit, unlikely. It's an extraordinary claim. It requires extraordinary evidence to be labelled part of our scientific understanding;\n * Wizards must be shown to exist\n * Invisible structures must be shown to exist\n * Examples of this phonomenon must be experimentally demonstrated and shown to be possible\n * Evidence of the prison itself in the predicted location must be found and verified\nAll of the above must be objectively verifiable by an unbiased observer who documents their experimental findings\nDiscussion of the existence of this wizard's prison with simply some human writings to go on is useless; we must go to the North Sea to attempt to find it and test for it. Using sonar, or underwater probes or some other method to attempt to find its location outside of human sensory input would be a good start. If an exhaustive search does not return evidence of the existence of this prison, we must conclude it is unlikely to exist.\n\nIn short, we need more evidence. Human words don't cut it, however eloquent they may be.\n\nEdits: Formatting things",

Eventually everything that ever exists will just die and vanish, nothing we do will ever have an effect in the world, because eventually everything that exists will die. The universe will die so will everything that lives in it. We will all go back to where we came from, nothing. No achievement or accomplishment anyone will do will have any effect on anything. We are just energy slowed down, everything we see is what our mind wants us to see. Emotions don't exist, they're just chemicals pumped by our brain.\n\nLife is just a drug that we are all addicted to and anyone that can't suicide is someone who can't get off of it. I'll admit I'm addicted too, I'm afraid of not taking this drug just like most of humanity. People say life is to feel but those feelings won't matter once you die and everything else dies.

Much of your ideas have changed my way of thinking drastically. I still believe that life is not very meaningful but I now believe that even though, I should try my best to make the most of it regardless of what I previously thought.

Very often when it comes to \"reaffirming your faith\" the historical evidence for the validity of the Bible (KJV specifically) is brought up. My skepticism is based more on the grounds of science and philosophical inquiry. Due to this, there's not much I can say in response to certain points of what they claim to be historically accurate. And honestly, if what they are saying to be true really is true, then the scale tips that much more in their favor. Basically, as I see if now, atheists have one historical account that brings the validity of the Bible into question, while christians have an account that backs up their trust in the validity of the Bible. Where is the disconnect here? I am aware that even if the Bible has somehow miraculously maintained perfect transcription, then it's original writings are still in conflict with other historical records as atheists like to point out. I am also aware of the effects that confirmation bias, and more deliberate picking and choosing has on what is considered historically canonical if you will. Growing up in this environment has only presented me with records that confirm and when I go out and look for myself, I find records that deny. What is the closest thing we as atheists can use as objective historical evidence to show how the history of the writing and translating of the KJV Bible is flawed? More specifically, instead of pointing out things that they haven't considered, what can we use to refute what they themselves are saying to be true. ",

Well, at least  according to my wife's side of the family who sometimes includes me, the known atheist, in their religious e-mail threads. You see, there's this shape in our cells that looks like a cross, therefore...God. What they're actually referencing is laminin. If you're not familiar with it, google/wiki a picture to see what has them feeling high and mighty.\n\nAnyways, I thought I'd share this e-mail to give a laugh and maybe see how you guys would deconstruct this \"proof\".\n\nHere it is:\n\nThe Cross in Our Bodies\n\"This is a pretty neat story and an interesting thing that few of us know. It's brief, so please read. (FROM A DOCTOR)\n\nA couple of days ago I was running (I use that term very loosely) on my treadmill, watching a DVD sermon by Louie Giglio... and I was BLOWN AWAY!  I want to share what I learned.... \nHe (Louie) was talking about how inconceivably BIG our God is...how He spoke the universe into being.. How He breathes stars out of His mouth that are huge raging balls of fire, etc., etc. Then He went on to speak of how this star-breathing, universe creating God ALSO knitted our human bodies together with amazing detail and wonder. At this point I am LOVING it (fascinating from a medical standpoint, you know). And I was remembering how I was constantly amazed during medical school as I learned more and more about God's handiwork. I remember so many times thinking, “How can ANYONE deny that a Creator did all of this???”\nLouie went on to talk about how we can trust that the God who created all this, also has the power to hold it all together when things seem to be falling apart...how our loving Creator is also our sustainer. \n\nAnd then I lost my breath. And it wasn't because I was running my treadmill, either!!! \n\nIt was because he started talking about laminin. I knew about laminin.. Here is how Wikipedia describes them: “Laminins are a family of proteins that are an integral part of the structural scaffolding of basement membranes in almost every animal tissue.” You see...laminins are what hold us together...LITERALLY. They are cell adhesion molecules. They are what holds one cell of our bodies to the next cell. Without them, we would literally fall apart. And I knew all this already. But what I didn't know is what they LOOKED LIKE.. \n\nBut now I do.  And I have thought about it a thousand times since (already)....  Here is what the structure of laminin looks like... AND THIS IS NOT a “Christian portrayal” of it.... If you look up laminin in any scientific/medical piece of literature, this is what you will see.... Now tell me that our God is not the coolest!!!  Amazing.  The glue that holds us together... ALL of us...  Is in the shape of the cross.  Immediately Colossians 1:15-17 comes to mind.  “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.  All things were created by him and for him.  He is before all things, and in him All things HOLD TOGETHER.”  Colossians 1:15-17\nCall me crazy. I just think that is very, very, very cool. Thousands of years before the world knew anything about laminin, Paul penned those words. And now we see that from a very LITERAL standpoint, we are held together... One cell to another....  By the cross.\n\nYou would never in a quadrillion years convince me that is anything other than the mark of a Creator who knew EXACTLY what laminin “glue” would look like long before Adam breathed his first breath!!\"",

I was walking my dog when I observed the following:\n\nA man - I believe in his 50's - with blonde hair and blue eyes, wearing a plaid shirt and jeans, was conversing with a Mexican/Latina woman about a Jetta with darkly tinted windows.  He said to her, \"Yeaahhhh if it gives you trouble, tell them to fix the (unintelligible) and it's usually only about forty bucks.  My first wife here (he points to a woman here) used to have this problem with it.\"  The women with him were of varying ages, but they were all wearing nearly identical clothes.  They had no phones, no purses, no obvious belongings.  One of them wore glasses.  Their dresses were pastel colored and were in three colors.  The oldest woman (who he called his \"first wife\") had the only unique color.  The other 5 or 6 had either a kind of coral colored dress or a light pink/fuschia dress.  The dresses were like Mormon prairie dresses, but without poofy shoulders, and they were kind of fitted.  Two of them were clearly younger than 16 years old, which has concerned me more and more since this happened.  They all had their hair pulled up really tight into buns and the buns were tightly wrapped with black felt/velvet fabric.\n\nEventually, they finished their exchange with the Mexican/Latina woman, then walked down the street about a block and got into an SUV with dark tinted windows, which they promptly drove away in.\n\nThey don't look like Mennonites or any other Mormon I've seen.  Honestly, they struck me as polygamists, but I've never met or seen any before, so I'm doubting myself.\n\nHas anyone seen religious folk like this before?  Or perhaps does anyone know the specific type of religious group I observed?\n\nThank you for your help and for reading! \n\n",
