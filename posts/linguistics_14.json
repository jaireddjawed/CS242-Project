For me, it takes me a second or so to process a singular they, because my brain doesn’t quite know whether to parse it as a singular or a plural. \nI admit that I have used singular they in certain contexts: eg “If anyone wants to run for student council, they must get a form from the teacher.” It sounds natural to me since multiple students could apply. However a sentence such as *”They just cut me off in traffic!” sounds unnatural to me since only one person is driving the car. That said, I’ve noticed younger generations (such as gen Z and gen α) causally using singular they. I’m wondering if there has been any psycholinguistic research into how different age groups perceive the pronoun “they”.",

        "text": "So, I’m in a class where we are participating in a science fair. I decided to choose the topic of language since I love learning about it. I found out about the controversial theory of linguistic relativism, and the pretty famous Russian siniy/goluboy experiment. For those who don’t know, this is a study where Russian speakers were pitted against English speakers to see which group could distinguish between shades of blue faster. The hypothesis was that since Russian separates blue into two distinct basic categories (light and dark blue), that the Russians would think of shades of blue as more different, and this would be able to distinguish between them faster. The data seemed to support this. \n\nI was interested in doing an experiment relating to color names, and realized that I could record data about a language that hasn’t been studied much in this area of research: Vietnamese. I could compare Vietnamese, Russian, and English speakers in an experiment. There are many Vietnamese and Russian students in my school, so I was thinking I could ask some to participate.\n\nFrom what I understand, Vietnamese includes blue and green in one basic color category: “xanh.” To specify further what type of grue one is talking about, Vietnamese speakers say things like “xanh like the leaves” or “xanh like the ocean” I wanted to study whether Vietnamese people therefore see these colors as more similar. \n\nHowever, realizing what I’m looking for, I feel like I am asking if Vietnamese people are slower than English and Russian speakers. Of course, if this stuff really determined someone’s cognition, Russian speakers would be smarter than English speakers, but of course that’s not the case. With that being said, I still don’t want to be the guy who disrespects an entire group of people in a shitty experiment studying linguistic relativism. I don’t want to be Whorf. \n\nI am asking for advice on what to write on the consent form I’ll be giving to my participants. I must write what I am studying, the hypothesis, and what they’ll be doing.",

But according to Hogg (2002), even though the verb clearly comes after the subject and object, it is considered verb second word order. \n\nThe reason given is that it is determined by weight such that phonologically light elements such as pronouns are placed before the verb. But regardless of how the verb receives its position, the fact remains that the verb is placed at the end. So how is it not a case of verb-final word order when the verb literally is placed at the end? \n\nWould appreciate any feedback on this. Ideally in terms of Old English but would like to hear if any of you know some kind of general linguistic definition of verb-final word order that would explain this.",

        "text": "I don’t understand as a Czech how there has been this notion that Czech and Slovak are separate languages, and I instead see them as two standards of a wider dialect continuum of one widely spoken language that has many dialectal forms that are either isolated within mountainous communities, or are being eroded by standard forms deleting the ignored dialects of the Czech-Slovak border area that build a bridge showing a dialect continuum, and here are my reasons why.\n\nWhen they’re so similar a speaker of one of the languages with no exposure to the other language can grasp what is being said to them in that said language. \n\nSecondly, the ‘languages’ split relatively late (1600-1700’s) I believe which to me doesn’t seem like a lot of time for the ‘languages’ to differentiate so much from each other, instead I believe that this gives times for dialects to differentiate further from each other.\n\nThirdly, Slovak and Czech are based off of dialects that have different standard forms (West Slovak and Literary Bible Czech) so this may cause people to view the ‘languages’ as separate since there is a great geographic divide between the languages (Moravia). They however ignore the fact that the dialects near the border mix (Slovácko dialect for example) and are hard to define as being ‘Czech’ or ‘Slovak’. Also most features that separate Czechoslovak from other Slavic languages, (especially Polish or Rusyn) are shard mutually by Czech and Slovak dialects only supporting my idea that the ‘languages’ must’ve split late and are different forms of a dialect continuum.\n\nLastly, if one can claim that the dialects are separate enough to be distinct languages due to being separate enough, how can one ignore the fact due to wider immigration and the massive influence of (Czech mostly unfortunately) media that the languages are converging again. A wider number of Slovak children unfortunately use ‘Czechisms’ from the mentioned reasons so there seems to be a sharing of vocabulary increasing the mutual intelligibility.\n\nI’d hope to hear your opinions about this from a linguistic view, particularly from other Czechs and Slovaks.",

Compensation Being offered is between $15 - $20 /hour.\n\n[https://grnh.se/7a2c34a2teu](https://grnh.se/7a2c34a2teu)\n\n**The Business Context**\n\nYou already use AI in many ways—like deciding what products and services to order—and it may be most familiar to you as a chatbot, as an avatar-maker, or as a way to unlock your screen. But here’s what AI may be able to help the world with: finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function. \n\nBut, like humans, algorithms are what they eat. They’re only as good as the rules they know and the data they’re trained on. We’re the team that helps model these behaviors.\n\n**The Role**\n\nAs an Advanced AI Data Trainer you will be working closely with a team of other trainers, with language models themselves, within protocols developed by the world’s leading AI researchers— training the AI to read, write, summarize knowledge, and interpret meaning. Think of it like being a language arts teacher or a personal tutor for some of the world’s most influential technology. \n\nThe goal of this AI is to be a safe, accurate, widely knowledgeable, and beneficial conversation partner to the world for a wide variety of purposes. Your job is to train, evaluate, and test the AI’s conversation skills, continuously equipping it to fulfill on that purpose.\n\nDay in and day out, you will:\n\n**Train the AI (20%)**\n\nYou’ll spend a bulk of your team simply *chatting* with the AI, helping it read large swaths of humanity’s documented knowledge and distinguish between what is presented as fact vs. context vs. patterns of behavior. \n\n**Evaluate the AI (40%)**\n\nOur partner’s mission is to develop AI models that are safe, accurate, and beneficial to humanity. You will continuously evaluate the AI according to those criteria and our training methods. For example, you will be discerning the accuracy of the facts that the AI is outputting, but also the accuracy with which they *interpret them.*\n\n**Test the AI (40%)**\n\nHow is testing different from evaluation? You’ll spend substantial amounts of time actively trying to “break” the AI by “forcing” mistakes and improving the way these AI models recover. This is absolutely critical to its safety, accuracy, and use. You’ll document breaks and have the opportunity to recommend improvements to the training methods themselves to both our team and our client.\n\n**The Person**\n\nThis is a technology job that accommodates humanities people and relies more fully on your *competencies* than your formal experience––making it a rare opportunity that’s perfect for new grads, career transitioners, and those seeking an exciting encore career. \n\nYou’re the sort of person who is exceptional at listening and reading for ground-level facts and intended meaning, and you can explain the inferences you made to link the two. Basically, you’ve got the metacognitive awareness to “show your work.” In addition, you’re the sort of person with a deep interest in linguistics. If you didn’t get a Ph.D., you probably wanted one. You instinctively document learnings and continuously refine methods. \n\nYou are a(n):\n\n* Diligent Reader\n* Dedicated Grammarian\n* Observant Listener\n* Self-Aware Interpreter\n* Synthetic Sense-Maker\n* Perpetual Learner\n* Instinctive Educator\n\n**Compensation &amp; Career**\n\n**Compensation**\n\nThis is an entry-level *role* perfect for voracious readers early in their careers, or for career switchers keen to enter the technology field. Pay begins between $15-$20 / hour to top applicants anywhere in the world, with promotion paths available for positions that are paid upwards of $40 / hour. The schedule is flexible and work is 20-40 hours / week based on demand. \n\n**Life &amp; Career**\n\nIdeally you are available between EST or PST time zones. The work is steady, the hours are flexible, the work is enjoyable, and leaves room for advancement into more senior training roles and project management roles on the Invisible team as the project expands. We’re keen to share more in interviews. ",

Basically, the Nanjing dialect definitely split off since the 14th century. Yet despite this, it's phonology basically underwent the same sound changes that happened in northern Mandarin since the 14th century. For example, the final -m was lost, velars became palatalized after /i/, and ɚ also emerged, and all these happened in both northern and Nanjing Mandarin. How is this even possible? How can a dialect split off and keep archaic features while innovating the same innovations as another dialect?",

For example, there’s a sweet spot between [ɨ] and [ɯ] and a little bit down that sounds exactly like [e], and one below and behind [ɶ] that sounds equally similar to [u]. [ɯ] can be imitated in the vicinity of [ɜ], and [ʉ] can be imitated in the vicinity of [ø]. \n    These reflected sounds seem to occur between the high-back and low-front quarters of vowel space, which leads me to hypothesize if the relationship of the two formants changed by height and backness might somehow reach the same net result from the sonic qualities of these two regions.\n    Does anyone here know anything more about this phenomenon? I had never heard of or considered the possibility of this phenomenon until accidentally producing one of these sounds, so I’m curious to know if it’s something that’s been studied before. \n    I would be especially interested to see if any real languages are attested to use these “mirror articulations” in their phonology, I.e. this language has a phoneme which acoustically appears to be [u] but is in fact pronounced in the low front area and treated as a low vowel. The only potential problem I see is that, if the two articulations are acoustically identical, there would be no reason for children learning the language to pick up one articulation over the other. (I’ve been unable to tell if these articulations are actually more difficult than their acoustic twins or if I’m just not used to them, for example the low front vowel resembling [u] is very low, requiring one to flatten the tongue against the curvature of the bottom of the mouth)",

(By local languages I 'm referring to the language or languages spoken by the native people before they were conquered by the Romans.) My question is: is there any surviving language and/or dialect that had very minimal foreign influence but instead was developed due to the passage of time and natural tendency languages have to change? \n\nIf such a language exists, I assume it would be in Italy, maybe close to the original birthplace of the Latin language? But I also know there were other languages, unrelated to Latin, in the Italian peninsula, so I have no clue if there are any languages that would even fit this description. Since I don't know much about the historical influences on the various romance language dialects, I thought I'd post this here.\n\nTo be clear, my question is not about which living language is closest to Latin, but which, if any, developed without the influence of languages other than Latin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I know that Latin itself had foreign influences.

        "text": "Please share your thoughts on the following shower thought:\n\nI've seen so much about vocal harmonics being described along the lines of \"simultaneous higher notes\" **but I think that's really not what they are.**\n\nYes, it's true that if you look at the voice through the lens of a spectrogram (frequency domain / FFT), it'll seem like many simultaneous notes, and with software you can even isolate and hear the individual frequencies and really make a convincing demonstration that seems to show that the sung note is made up of many higher harmonics / overtones (and then wow, it's such a miracle how our brains are able to hear all those frequencies as a single coherent frequency). \n\nHowever, I think that the entire **frequency domain** analysis in such a case is mistaken and misleading. If you look at the same vocal in the **time domain** (like an oscilloscope), the voice will all of the sudden makes sense and indeed seems to be a single frequency. There will be no wonder it sounds like a single frequency, it is a single frequency! In the lens of time domain we can understand how frequencies can exist as single frequencies even if their shape is more complex than a sine wave. Whereas in the limited lens of frequency domain, anything other than a pure sine wave gets mistaken for being a multitude of frequencies. No it isn't, time domain represents the reality better in this case.\n\n**Metaphor:** To look at the messy output of vocal harmonics in frequency domain instead, is as foolish as analyzing a printed book on a pixel level instead of reading the actual text content. Yes, it's true that a page of text **can** be analyzed through the lens and mindset of pixels, and you can even isolate each row of pixels and demonstrate how when you put all the individual rows of pixels together you get the page of text, but no, that's missing the whole point of the page of text, you are analyzing the text using the wrong lens, the wrong tool. **See the text as letters, words and sentences. Not pixels!**\n\nLikewise, **see the voice in the time domain, not a frequency-domain** FTT deconstruction mess of the voice. (For the subject of formants per se, it may be OK to peek at the frequency domain, voice for the subject of vocal harmonics on a vocal fold level, time domain explains what's happening much better.)\n\nAny thoughts on my thoughts?",

        "text": "I have been noticing as of recent that people around me have different realizations of /b d g/. Older folks, especially my parents, keep them pretty standard, without changes (except for my dad when drunk). However, among my friends, /b d/ become \\[m n\\] or maybe \\[m^(b) n^(d)\\], and /g/ becomes \\[^(ŋ)g\\] or \\[ŋ\\]. Even when trying to be funny, in the style of Regular Show's Mordecai and Rigby (I'm uncultured), we tend to sustain the \\[m n\\] then pronounce the \\[b d\\]. My realization of intervocalic /d/, standardly realized as \\[ɾ\\], is sometimes also nasalized into \\[n\\], like &lt;better&gt;: \\[m^(b)ɛ̃nɚ\\]\n\nI have not been paying particular attention to the locations where these happen. It seems like word-initially or at some syllable onsets, maybe? My interest was piqued in this when my friend, who prefers to use Voice to Text on Discord, accidentally got Siri to hear him saying \"any\" instead of \"Eddie,\" another friend of ours.\n\nI have also been taking singing lessons recently. My teacher has told me when I'm very nasal (not that she hates it and doesn't want me to do it, she just wants me to notice it). I have to try actively to denasalize my whole voice. She also mentions *old* country singers always sounding nasal. \n\nAlong with that, I've also noticed that, especially after the nasalized voiced plosives, my vowels become nasalized, perhaps throughout the whole word, unless I've got a fully clear throat and no sticky mouth. I wouldn't know about my friends. \n\nAlthough, some places or shops or other things, I don't always nasalize. This table is whether or not I nasalize the voiced plosives. For teachers and parents and whomever else, they are mostly un-nasalized.\n\n|NAME|NASALIZED VOICED PLOSIVES?|\n|:-|:-|\n|Burlington|Yes|\n|Abbadabba's|Sometimes|\n|Berlin|Sometimes|\n|Decatur|Sometimes|\n|Duluth|No|\n|Pu**b**lix|Sometimes|\n|Kro**g**er|Sometimes|\n|Gainesville|Sometimes|\n|Gwinnett|Sometimes|\n|Jaguar|Sometimes|\n|Ala**b**ama|Yes|\n|Beirut|Yes|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else see this in the American South?

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

That's usually how present perfect gets taught. This phenomenon is however an inversion of that.\n\nReal example:\n\n\"The occupants managed to get themselves out of the car through a sunroof, they've then decamped out the back yard of a neighbouring address.\"\n\nI have no idea if they do this in the UK, I suspect it doesn't happen at all in the US.
