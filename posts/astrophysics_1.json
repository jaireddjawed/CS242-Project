From there over billions of years it could form into new stars and planets. Our solar system is in the outskirts of the Milky Way galaxy so maybe we are relative new comers to the Milky Way.

Even in a thought experiment in an otherwise 'sterile' environment in an interglactic void, the CMB will produce a steady input of energy. This produces, hypothetically, always, a large 'flash' of energy which heats up the object this point of view was on, turning it into a localized thermal problem and relativity problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe outer layers will process first, then the inner, as time reattaches, more or less, as the large 'kaboom' slowly leaks out, first as radio then as more energetic things, then rapidly flashes out as the black hole ends its lifespan in the far future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe intermediate point of view, will  experience more or less the same; most orbits that experience a overly high time dilation or speed which implies superluminal speeds, will likely usually hit the same issue with the outside flash reducing it to its component particles, locally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr in other words, the sky gets super bright as time speeds up, too bright for anything to be emitted upwards, then it suddenly cools down and everything radiates like it normally would when hit with that much CMB energy, on the object which formed the event horizon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime dilation effects are weird.  In this way, relativity is the cosmic censor; nothing which exceeds the limits of the universe will happen, because it cant happen, because it has no time to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it also semi resolves the 'information loss' problem; it's not lost, it's super slow and detached; anything going down into the zone of detachment gets slowed down if it doesn't get ripped apart by tidal forces or cooked by the CMB, and winds up going zoom into the future.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelativity all the way down\\~ at no point does the observer observe anything out of the ordinary happening according to the local laws of physics. anything which would exceed certain values winds up being postponed til those limits are not exceeded\\~ there's never a naked singularity because it never has time to form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...No clue if this is how things work, but again, I did say I had a migraine and wrote this down during such. \\^\\_\\^",

        "text": "I want to check my understanding about stellar feedback for an upcoming talk. Does anyone agree with this explanation:\n\nStellar feedback refers to the various ways in which stars can influence their surroundings. These influences can be observed in a wide range of physical scales, from the immediate vicinity of individual stars to the large-scale structure of entire galaxies. There are four primary mechanisms of stellar feedback:\n\nPhotoionizing radiation:\n\nPhotoionizing radiation refers to the high-energy photons emitted by hot, young stars that have enough energy to ionize neutral atoms in their vicinity. When these photons encounter neutral gas in the interstellar medium, they strip electrons from the atoms, creating a plasma of charged particles. This process can significantly affect the temperature and density of the surrounding gas, leading to the formation of ionized regions, such as H II regions, and affecting star formation by altering the conditions of the interstellar medium.\n\nRadiation pressure:\n\nRadiation pressure is the force exerted on matter by the radiation emitted by stars. The photons in starlight carry momentum, and when they collide with particles of matter, they transfer some of this momentum, exerting a force on the particles. This radiation pressure can affect the motion of gas and dust in the interstellar medium, leading to the formation of bubbles and shells around stars and affecting star formation by disrupting the structure of molecular clouds.\n\nStellar winds:\n\nStellar winds are the outflows of particles, such as ions and electrons, from the surfaces of stars. These winds can be driven by a variety of mechanisms, including thermal pressure, radiation pressure, and magnetic fields. Stellar winds can significantly affect the surrounding gas, leading to the formation of bubbles and shells around stars and affecting star formation by altering the conditions of the interstellar medium.\n\nSupernovae:\n\nSupernovae are the explosive deaths of massive stars. During a supernova, a large amount of energy is released, and the star's outer layers are ejected into the interstellar medium. This ejection can have a significant impact on the surrounding gas, leading to the formation of supernova remnants and affecting star formation by triggering the collapse of nearby molecular clouds.\n\nOverall, these four mechanisms of stellar feedback play critical roles in shaping the structure and evolution of galaxies and their constituent stars.",

For the sake of argument, I’ll call this an “information horizon” where information is lost forever and even impossible to extrapolate from current knowledge. Is it possible that has already happened?\n\nFor example, let’s say that shortly after the Big Bang, matter was consequently arranged into small clusters of elephants. Those elephants are long gone now and were formed/destroyed in a time where light from the Great Elephant Event would never reach us. \n\nAre there “elephants” of our universe’s past that are now impossible for us to know ever existed? Or is our universe still relatively new enough that we can eventually know everything with more powerful telescopes better technology?\n\nHope that question (and my ridiculous thought experiment) made sense.",

Certainly, logically, there must be an energy, a base sustaining that movement and that base energy is prior to quantum fluctuations and the appearance of particles because it is their very existence that allows precisely that they can arise.   \nNow, that base energy is prior to the fluctuations, prior to the movement of particles and as I said at the beginning, measurement and movement are closely related so it would be impossible to calculate the total energy of that base energy of the vacuum, because essentially all our science is based on calculating on measuring but before that base energy that is prior to the movement we can not do anything, We can only calculate the effects of that vacuum energy once it manifests itself in fluctuations and particles but 'the base' of that energy will always be hidden from science, from calculations.",

When you fold the pancake, you are seeing the back to some extent, and that is \"sort of\" (very loose analogy) how a black hole works. However, the light of an accretion disk around black hole is not a rigid object, and even if it was it would be pulled apart. So why does light bend in a perfect arch from the back to the \"top\"? Why does light on the edge of the accretion disk appear \"higher\" than light on the inside of the disk?\n\nAs an expounding on this question, does light completely \"wrap around\" the black hole as a the crust \"wraps around\" the mantle of the earth (faulty analogy, I know)? If so, why is a black hole with an accretion disk not completely covered in light, and in that way almost indistinguishable from a star? The light appears to \"stop\" in a \"wall\" at an angel parralel to the viewer of the black hole. \n\nI hope these questions make sense. I tried looking around for the answer to these questions but could not find it, and so I am curious if anyone here has thought about it before. I look forward to hearing everyone's responses!",

My understanding is that this is not the temperature that would be\"felt\", but rather the kinetic energy of molecules at this altitude, as they are too sparsely distributed to impart a sensation of heat to an observer. Assuming the exobase lies at an altitude where the [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path) of a molecule is equal to the [pressure scale height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height), how might the temperature of molecules at this height be estimated? To my understanding, Earth's solar constant is 1.361 kW/m^(2) which translates to only 394 Kelvin using the E =  σ x T^(4) relationship between energy and temperature. To get the 1500 Kelvin temperature quoted, a number around 287 kW/m^(2) would be required. In this case, how do molecules approach temperatures that are around four times higher? I feel as though I've critically misunderstood something.\n\nOf course, variations in solar activity, the constituent elements of the molecule, and planetary temperature will make the exact figure variable; I'm just looking for a ballpark answer. \n\nI'd also then like to use this temperature to estimate the scale height of a non-Earth atmosphere so that I can then determine the altitude of its exobase, though I'm unsure if this is the best method to take. From what I can tell, the Earth's exobase occurs a minimum of 500 kilometers above the surface, which using the molar gas constant (8.314462618 m^(2)\\*kg\\*s^(-2)\\*K^(-1)\\*mol^(-1)), air's molar mass (28.97 g/mol), and Earth's average gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s^(2)), requires a temperature of **17,000 Kelvin** to obtain the 500 kilometer altitude quoted. What's going on here?",

If someone knows how to calculate the lifspan (in years) for a binary system that would be amazing. Additionally, I am open to applying the Chandrashekhar Limit on binary system, I would just appreciate a few pointers on how exactly to apply it. Finally, if someone has another metric for determining the lifespan of a star, I would be open to researching that as well. Any help for this topic is appreciated, but I must keep calculations for mass in my paper, anything else can be modified.",
