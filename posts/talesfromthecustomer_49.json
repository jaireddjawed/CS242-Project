I had to get a temporary watch band until I could go to a nicer jewelry store a little farther from where I live. I made my way over to the jewelry section, which is not very big, and I asked for a new watch band. I showed the woman my watch (a Raymond Weil from the '90s my father had given me) and she just stared at me. She asked me one question about 3 times: \"This is *your* watch, right?\" and each time I replied \"Yes.\" I finally asked her if she could replace my watch band and she left. Not saying a word. Why?\n\nShe went to get her manager.\n\nAt this point, my mom drops by and asks if I was done getting the watch band, as the woman and the manager are walking back. She sees my mom and shoos the manager away. The manager said \"So what, you brought me here for nothing?\"\n\nIt wasn't until the watch band was on when it hit me - she thought I had stolen the watch. Solely because of my age. If I was 18, or 21, or 50, she wouldn't have done that.\n\nEverything seems to be fine, until I get to my foot appointment that I had 15 minutes later. She had put the watch strap on backwards.\n\nSo I trudge back to the store, and pray to god that the woman had gone on break. God must have heard my prayers because she had. I got the watch strap put on the correct way, didn't mention the ageism to the manager (I have no idea why, I should have done it), and went on my merry way.\n\nA week later, my uncle picked up a new watch strap for me from that jewelry place as a gift. I know he doesn't Reddit, but if he happens upon this, thanks again!",

        "text": "I live in a small city in a fairly rural county in Ohio near the PA and WV boarder. My town has a large Latin (Guatemalan and El Salvadoran) population because there are large factories and packaging facilities on the outskirts of town.  Downtown is about 2 streets over from my house, and right on the same block as my house basically is a general store whose logo and bags are yellow. Seeing as how it is so close, I usually will just walk over if I need pop or chips or anything. I am there just about everyday at one point or another so I know all employees pretty well and will usually talk to them for a little while anytime I am there. The last week and a half or so has been insanely cold and we have had a ton of snow. \n\nSo one day, I get done with work early and get home and then decide to stop at the store for a few things. As I am walking across the front of the building to go inside, I see a group of three Latino dudes (LD's from now on) talking and laughing and messing around in the snow. We all head into the store at about the same time, and the three LDs are standing up at the front in front of huge glass windows, talking and laughing, still looking outside. I can understand Spanish pretty well (as far as speaking it, not so much), so I can hear and understand what they are talking about for the most part, which happens to be, basically, the weather, and how they have never seen this much snow. \n\nWell then a short, round, wide guy(WG) and his two kids (MM1 and MM2) (they all three looked like they ate Michelin Man), walk into the store. As they are coming in, they see the 3 LDs looking out the window and laughing and talking, and immediately get sour looks on their face. WG then follows the LDs, shouting at them \"Why are you laughing at my son? You guys see something funny?\" I am only 2 feet away at this point, as the store is pretty small. I can hear the LDs trying to say they weren't laughing at him, or his son, etc, but the guy kept yelling he can't understand them with their accents. \n\nNow, I hate these type of people, and I was seething mad at this point, until finally I had had enough and, got in front of the guy, about 4 inches from his face, looking down at him. This is the exchange that took place:\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"They were never laughing at you or you morbidly obese kids! They were laughing at, and playing around in the snow, because where they are from, they have never had snow, you f**cking idiot! No one gives nearly enough shit to actually stand around and discuss you or your kids. Get whatever you came here to get and get the fuck out!\" \n\n&gt; **WG**: \"Well, if they spoke American, there wouldn't have been a problem!\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"The word you meant to use was English, American isn't a language. And I doubt even all Americans would understand what the hell you were saying since it's pretty apparent you didn't do so well in your English classes in school.\"\n\nHe then grabs what he had come for, got his shitty kids, and went outside. I apologized to the 3 LDs for causing a scene and I told them I hope they had a good day, and to ignore ignorant hillbillies. \n\nI go to the register, apologize to the cashier for yelling and causing a scene, she tells me she wishes she could have said it herself. \n\nI walk out the door, and right before me stands WG, waiting for me to come out. He says \"They really need to learn to not speak in latino talk\", to which I almost piss from laughing at him so hard. As I am walking away, I yell \"Half the country speaks \"in latino talk\", you should get used to it\", and with that, I was off to my home.\n\ntl;dr: Arrogant Hillbilly thinks 3 spanish speaking dudes are shit talking him, in fact only talking about the weather. I intervene, end up laughing because of the guys stupidity.\n\nEdit: Spelling, grammar\n\n\n\n",

Anybody can go sit down and just hang out. There are a lot of homeless people in town who are just looking for a place to sit and warm up, so it's a popular place for them to congregate for a few hours.\n\nLately the store's security has been trying to crack down on people hanging around for a long time. They start telling people to leave. Eventually there's only my grandpa left, sitting by himself.\n\nMy grandpa is not a hobo. He has these old boots and a somewhat ragged coat that he likes to wear. He is perfectly happy wearing these and refuses to buy new clothes. \n\nSo the security guy comes up to my grandpa and taps his knuckles on the table. \"You need to leave. You're taking up space.\"\n\nMy grandpa looks around this empty deli area, \"Okay. I just have some shopping to do.\" He gets up and starts walking towards the exit. My grandma happens to be there and asks him what's up. He told her what happened and she got upset. She went off to find a manager to speak to. Grandpa was nearly at the exit when the manager ran up to him, trying to apologize for what happened. He even asked my grandpa to come in and do his shopping. Grandpa said, \"I'll do my shopping at -competing store-.\" \n\nTwo managers and the security guy all called and left messages for him the next day. They wanted his business back and offered gift cards. He did not accept them, saying that he can't be bought back. ",

I was scared of messing it up, though, so I grabbed my best friend (I'll call her Marie) and went to a hair salon downtown. I went in, the lady at the front desk pointed me to a chair and told me to wait for a stylist, who involved us into the weirdest dialogue ever.\n\nStylist: So what do you want?\n\nI explain how I'd like my hair to be cut, show her a picture on my phone, etc.\n\nStylist: Do you want me to wash your hair first?\n\nMe: No, thanks, I washed it this morning.\n\nStylist: It won't be more expensive.\n\nMe: No, thank you.\n\nStylist: Okay, so we're going to wash your hair first.\n\nI was pretty intimidated by that point (I'm not good at talking to strangers) and just stared desperately at Marie.\n\nMarie: Can't you just cut her fringe?\n\nStylist: Well, maybe she should have told me she wants a fringe, I can do that without washing her hair first!\n\nSo, I was slightly annoyed by that point, but maybe it was just a misunderstanding, right? So she starts cutting my hair, sneers at the fact that I have a tiny bit of brown regrowth at my roots (the rest of my hair is dyed blue), and eventually tells me she's done. My fringe came down to my eyebrows at this point.\n\nStylist: That will be 6€ then.\n\nMe: Wait...this isn't what I wanted at all. I wanted it to be short.\n\nStylist: I'm done.\n\nMe: I think there was a misunderstanding? I wanted a shorter fringe. *shows picture again*\n\nStylist: That's stupid, it doesn't look good at all.\n\nMarie: Look, can you please just cut her hair now?\n\nAnd so she did. And walked off and told me she was done again halfway through, leaving the left half of my fringe longer than the right half. By that point, I was so angry that I just slammed my money on the counter at the front and left without arguing because I didn't want to let anyone at that salon go near my hair again. I managed to even it out at home, though, and now I trim it myself again.\n\nWe still spent a lot of time wondering what the hell was wrong with that stylist, though.",

        "text": "Hi, when browsing through this subreddit on mobile, I recalled a terrifying experience I had as a teen at CircleMart, in a mall, that made me unable to go to back there for a while. It wasn't really the store's employees themself, but the mall security.\nBear with me for formatting, I've never posted in reddit before.\n\n\n\n\nI was accompanying my mom at CircleMart, and since I was super into books I agreed to meet up with my mom later when she finished shopping. Upon heading to the book section, there were two other people paging through the books there, maybe reading them or glimpsing at the content. I paid them no mind and I picked up a book and started reading the summary on the inside book flap.\n\n\n\n\nI had set down the first book and was reading the back of another when there was a gruff \"Excuse me.\" from the side. I looked up to see mall security, **MS** for short, and middle school me was terrified, but managed to nod in response. I was about 10, a chubby Asian with long hair.\n**MS** told me to follow him, so I set down the book and followed him to the mall entrance of the store, wishing I was with my mom. He turns to me and says:\n\n\n\n\n**MS**: You were reported for loitering, and I need you to understand that this is your first strike, am I clear?\n\n\n**Me**:O-okay, but I was just looking at summaries because I wanted a book...\n\n\n**MS**: You were reading the book in the aisle, and that counts as loitering. Do I need to call for someone else?\n\n\n**Me**: No, I'm with my mom, I'll go to her now...\n\n\n\n\nHe didn't stop me as I rushed back into the store, frantically looking for my mom because I was terrified and loitering sounded like a really bad crime. I found her in the food aisle, and clung to her until we were in line, then she realized that she didn't want one of the snacks she got, so I went to put it back.\nI was pacing down aisles with the snacks in my hand, trying to find the snack section and debating if I should just leave it with the soups, when I heard a familiar voice say \"Stop!\"\nIt was **MS** again.\n\n\n\n\n**MS**: Come with me.\nI followed him back to the mall entrance again, scared out of my mind and my mom was waiting at the line. I waited with the **MS**, too scared to mention needing to go to.the opposite end of the store. **MS** radios someone, and another security person arrives, who **MS** talks to while I'm fidgeting. He then starts pestering me, asking me if I took anything, and that stealing can get me arrested, scaring me into only being able to answer with headshakes. He then tells me to. leave the store, and I manage to squeak that my mom was waiting at the entrance to the parking lot. **MS** stays at the mall entrance, while the new security guy walks me over to my mom, who was just about to get me intercommed because I was taking so long. She thanked the security guard and dragged me out, and I didn't recount the story until we got home, to which she responded that **MS** probably thought I was a shifty teenager. I didn't go back to the mall until I was 12, terrified that I was going to get caught again.\n\n\n\n\nNow, I'm just resentful and annoyed that two other people in the book aisle were paging through books and yet I was barely there and got dragged off by the mall cop.",

        "text": "*So this'll be last year. It's been a while but I'll post anyway, I still remember. I never told anyone this because I don't usually care about attention, but after seeing all the shit on TalesFromRetail I feel like putting up my positive story. This is the right sub by the looks of it so here goes*\n---- \n\n\nSo, it was just after Christmas. You know the buzz, you're stocked up on treats and toys (I would have been 18 and I'm a lame nerdy guy who likes Lego and Video Games). \n\n\n\nSo I had Christmas money to spend, and since there was no rush to buy presents, the mall was open and not as packed as before Christmas.  \n\n\n\nI have a Nintendo 3DS and was looking to get something new to play. I was looking for something like New Super Mario Bros 2 or something else, I forget what else. (I like Nintendo stuff so Mario/Zelda etc, it'll have been one of the typical Nintendo-related things like characters from Super Smash Bros' franchises). \n\n\nSo I go into $ (UK Game store, not bad, like to have stock for all platforms and gaming magazines and merchandise).\n\nI'm browsing the 3DS games and I find Paper Mario Sticker Star. I also find a copy of New Super Mario Bros 2. Hooray! Now, I've never played Paper Mario. But it's Mario. But I want something I know I'll enjoy, since I only have money for one. Somewhere along the time I hear something about something being \"yellow\". Pikachu is yellow. Tails is yellow. I think nothing of it. Now, if you know NSMB2 you'll know there's a big emphasis on coins and the case is yellow. The voice was quiet and not near me so I don't jump to that conclusion, the store was busy and it could have been a comment on any yellow object. Could have been a kid's snot for all I know.\n\n\nThe games are low so I'm crouched and out of my peripheral vision I see a small kid to my right. His mom just behind. I hear his little voice say \"I couldn't find it mommy but- ...Oh, they have one look, but that boy has it\". Even if I hadnt heard him, somehow you could just feel the happiness vanish from the area. Something about his movement being an excited run down my vision then a dead halt.\n\nI turn and ask if this is what he's looking for, holding out NSMB2, to which he nodded. I look back at the case and hand it to him, saying \"Here, enjoy it. And I'll get this one\". His face lit up and he and his mom thanked me as we all went to pay. They ended up two people ahead of me but I could still here the chat of the nice gesture.\n\nAs a gamer myself I know how amazing they feel and as an adult I knew I could wait for a game or just get any other game I'm interested in. I know the disappointment that would come from going to get a game and it not being available. So I did the awesome thing for a fellow gamer who looked to only be 7ish. Plenty more years ahead of him for more awesome stuff :D\n\n\n\n**And for those wondering, yes, Paper Mario was amazing &lt;3**",

        "text": "I'm still not sure why I'm thinking about this, but another story came back to me from my time with a service dog, this one involving my rescue by a nice book store employee.\n\nI had my dog for most of my teenage years but don't currently use a dog now, and to clarify some things from the comments on my previous stories; a service dog is not a guaranteed perfect solution. It is one solution to what is often a multi-option problem. I had my dog for five years. I *used* and *benefited* from my dog for five years. Those were years I was a minor and did not make my own medical decisions. As an adult I chose to explore other options, and I was much happier. I'd rather the validity of my service dog wasn't challenged simply because I'm not using him now. At this point, I'd likely have retired him to 'pet' status anyway simply due to his age.\n\nSo, to set the scene a little; teenage me was a bookworm, and my parents were happy to encourage this. We lived near one of those small-town bookstores with a personality all its own, and we were frequent customers. The staff knew me, they knew the dog, and they liked both of us. At the time of this story I think I must've been fifteen.\n\nIt wasn't unusual for me to head over the book store when I had a little extra money. It was in a busy downtown area, and my dog and I went on foot. On this particular day, we were only a few storefronts away we drew the attention of an approaching mother and her young child. The mother got that look on her face, the pointing-out-novelty look, and started pointing at me and talking to her daughter in a get-excited mom tone. She met my eyes, and I gave my head a firm shake and mouthed 'no' before disappearing into the book store and what I assumed was safety.\n\nI'd only gone a few shelves into the store and was perusing the new titles on display when I heard the bell over the door ring. A few moments later and someone was standing intimately close to me and asking warmly, \"Would it be all right if my daughter could pet your dog?\"\n\nWhat the hell, lady? You followed me in here? I shook my head again. \"No, I'm sorry. He's a service dog.\"\n\n\"But you brought him into the store. Surely he must be tame.\" \n\n\"He is, but service dogs can't be touched while they're working.\"\n\n\"But he's not doing anything. He's not *your* service dog, right? You're just training him for someone who needs him. It wouldn't hurt for her to have a little pet.\"\n\n\"No, he's mine. He's working.\"\n\n\"Well.\" She'd lost some of her sunny demeanor now, but she still seemed reasonably pleasant. \"My daughter is right here.\"\n\nI looked down and confirmed that yup, her daughter was indeed physically present on the temporal plane between us. When I waited a moment and she didn't elaborate, I decided to interpret 'my daughter is right here' as 'look, I promised this kid something so help me out here,' and in the interest of getting rid of her, I helpfully knelt down and gave the kid my service dog talk, which I sadly had prepared because she wasn't the first parent who decided to ask a random teenager to explain service dogs and the disabled to their small child rather than answering the kid's questions themselves. Kid starts loudly asking if that girl is blind? Let's go ask her to her face; that's not rude at all. But the daughter nodded agreeably at the end of it and actually didn't seem too bothered about not getting to pet him, so I stood back up, smiled politely at her mother, and left them both there in my search for a good book.\n\nIt wasn't a particularly large store, so it wasn't hard for me to hear the ensuing conversation between the mother and the woman behind the counter. It went a little something like this.\n\n\"That girl wouldn't let my daughter touch her dog. She was cagey about the whole thing, and she says that dog is hers. I don't think it should be in here, it can't be tame.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't have anything to worry about. I know that girl, and that's just how service dogs work.\"\n\n\"But is that dog *safe*?\"\n\n\"He's never been a problem, we just have to leave him alone while he's working.\"\n\n\"I just don't know if she should be in here...\"\n\n\"Well, if you're worried about it, maybe you should come back later.\"\n\nAnd, thankfully, she left.

Right next to cafeteria, there is a sandwich shop, which we shall call SS.\n\nNow, because of my schedule, I had to eat there basically every day. But that's okay, that's what pretty much everyone on campus did.\n\nThe problem with only having one place to eat on campus is how, during lunch, basically everyone who didn't want to go out to eat got filed through that one line. It could be incredibly frustrating for everyone. But some people took it too far, and I've seen the people who work there deal with some serious shit.\n\nI happened to work right next to that place. So I would simply be around a lot, and would either beat the line or wait until the line was getting shorter before I started waiting. This wasn't a problem.\n\nAfter about a year, I got in the habit of taking the people who worked there baked goods- cookies, brownies, whatever. The real reason is how I didn't want to waste a batch of stuff just because I couldn't eat it all, and SS people need love too... it just seemed like a good idea? I mean, their jobs ain't easy. It just seemed like the nice thing to do.\n\nSo, most of the people who work there recognized me, if not outright knew my name. Life is good.\n\nOne day, I had the day from hell- an instructor for a project based class realized we weren't going to get through their plans before the Christmas break, so they decided to throw 3 more projects on us in the last week and a half before then, due before break; I just found out a near decade-old family dog had just been put down because he had a brain tumor; and was having serious problems at work and was generally overstressed. It was an emotional day.\n\nSo, I head straight from class to work, drop my stuff off, nearly in tears because *how the hell am I going to get all this done in a week*, when I head up to SS to order lunch because I need SOMETHING to do. They all have these little star ornaments taped to their hats for the holiday season.\n\nWhen they're finishing my food, one of them goes \"Hold on a sec, we got somethin' for ya!\"\n\nWhen she came back out she handed me a cupcake and one of the little ornaments they had on their hats to put on a Christmas tree.\n\nI thank them a lot, go back into the office and start bawling.\n\nI don't really have a better ending to this story, that's just what happened. The timing was a little appropriate in retrospect, though.\n\nSometimes a customer makes an employee's day; sometimes an employee makes a customer's day. Employees, don't ever underestimate what you do for a customer, even if some obnoxious people don't realize it.\n\n**TL;DR** A fast food worker gave me a cupcake and an ornament for Christmas and I cried about it.",

Just a drink, please. \n\nGuy: -goes to fill my drink and almost drops it because he's trying not to laugh- Here you go. \n\nSo I pay, and now I'm curious. No one else is around so I have to know. \n\nMe: I'm sorry, I'm nosy. Why are you guys laughing so much? What happened?\n\nGuy &amp; Girl: -gives each other these looks- \n\nMe: -smiles- It's okay. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I'm just really nosy sometimes. \n\nGuy: It's okay. I did something bad. \n\nGirl: He touched a hot dog!\n\nMe: -trying hard not to giggle- Did you really?\n\nGuy: -after a moment of consideration- My finger MAY have brushed it!\n\nApparently, the rules are they have to wear gloves when handling the food. The guy had already served the customer their hot dog. But the guy assured me he washed his hands, but still felt guilty about the fact. \n\nMe: Hey, long as you don't spit in my food, we're good. I'm not going to fuss over something that small. \n\nGuy: You won't tell, will you?\n\nMe: Nah. I'm to lazy for that. You guys have a good night. \n\nAnd thus me and my SO went to go see our movie. When we left I nodded to the two as I left, and got a smile in return. I can only assume there were a lot of dick jokes going on behind when no one was around, hence all the laughing. \n\nStill awesome though. Didn't like the movie, but got a nice laugh while I was there. \n\n",

Not confrontational or prying at all. He asked why I wanted to cancel and I explained, and then he said no worries and that the charges would be reversed! I thanked him several times as I did not even think to have the charges reversed, and was ready to just chalk it up to a lesson learned. \n\nAnyway, he was really wonderful and so, so nice.

The one I tried was the biggest they had in stock. So, I couldn't buy it at all.\nI saw a shirt I wanted to try, but it was high up on the wall and you needed to ask an employee to get it down with this long stick/pole-thing (not sure what it is called). \n\nWell, the two co-workers at the lines were busy and there was another employee walking around the store so I asked that one if he could please get the shirt down for me. \nHe already looked intimidating/had resting asshole face, but he was the least busiest looking employee.\nHe did so (completely silently) and I asked him to unlock their dressing room so I could try the shirt. He was completely quiet and did not look happy. Kinda awkward.. but whatever. \n\nAnyway, it was too tight and I can't put it back where it was because it was really high on the wall and you had to use the pole. So I just hung it back on a lower shirt rack in the store.\n\nLeaving to check-out... I had some lipsticks and a lanyard. The store wasn't as busy now. The employee who helped me was checking me out and asked me: \"Did the shirt fit?\"\nI said no. Then he was like: \"Well, where did you put it?!?!?!\" and I said I put it on a hanger on a rack near the changing room. \n\nSo, I (obviously) couldn't put it back on my own because of the pole thing, right...\n\nHe already scanned my lipsticks and lanyard, btw. He paused immediately like a deer in the headlights and walked away, mumbled (loudly) to his co-worker about: \"Hang on, NOW I have to do THIS.\" and left in the middle of the transaction (there was a line behind me) to go find the shirt and put it back on the wall. And his co-worker was working the other line. So he left me and the line of people behind me in the middle of checking out.\nWtf?! He was pissed I couldn't put it back? Besides, when I was done trying it on, he was busy helping someone else at the time. He could of went and found the shirt after he checked me out.\n\nI just couldn't believe the way he acted towards me. I threw all the shit I had at the counter (it fell) and left the store while he left me alone at the front of the check-out line and was towards the back of the store getting the shirt.\n\nEver since that incident, I hate going into *alternative clothing store* in the mall.",

I understand how the business works and I understand that there are dumb customers, but not once in my life have I ever said anything rude in front of a customer. EVER..\n\nLast year around this time I was shopping at my local mall and stopped in a store that has lots of lotions, perfumes, shower gels, etc. At this time they were having a sale buy 3, get 3 free. I love this stuff so I went in and started buying my favorite scents, my mom's favorites, and my boyfriend's favorite shower gel.\n\nWhen I got to the register this is what happened. There are 3 people involved in this interaction.\nMe, cashier 1 (C1), and cashier 2 (C2)\n\nI put all the stuff on the counter, C1 rang up everything.\n\n&gt;C1: Your total is $xx.xx\n\n&gt;Me: Whoa! Is that with the buy 3 get 3 free?\n\n(I had spent way more than I thought I did and was just genuinely shocked. The words just flew out of my mouth before I could stop them.)\nC1 looks at C2\n\n&gt;C1: I swear these people think that there total is going to be $0.00 with this shit.\n\n&gt;C2: Some people are just too stupid for their own good.\n\nI am absolutely floored. I paid for what I bought and never said another word. However, after I got home the more that I thought about it, the more angry I got. I'm not an idiot. I understand if you buy something you pay for it. I just spoke before I thought.\n\nIf a customer had said that to me I probably wouldn't have thought twice about it. If I did I would never say it in earshot of a customer.\n\nThat is the first and only time I've ever called a corporate number to file a complaint. The person I spoke to seemed honestly shocked that it happened and couldn't believe that an employee would say something like that. I mean, I know she believed, but really who does that at their place of employment?\n\n\nAfter a long conversation and at least 5 minutes of insisting on getting my address to send me a $20 gift card, I finally caved. I wasn't doing it to get anything free whatsoever. I just think that a business should know if they have an incident like that happen. I would want to know if it was my business.\n\nI still shop there regularly and have never had this happen again, but that was just one unbelievable experience.",

Since my ID isn't a driver's license, Annie has to call the manager on duty to verify it, and she always does and it's fine because she's just doing her job. \n\n2 of the three managers have always approved of it no problem, but not this time.

Your ID shouldn't be a problem.\"\n\nWhich lead me to realize that she deliberately decided not to take it with all intentions of not doing it because she didn't feel like it or whatever; while the other managers didn't mind. \n\nI'm very pissed about how she treated me, but at the same time I don't have a leg to stand up and bring attention to this because their policy is very general/loose and it's up to their discretion. \n\n*^Edited ^formatting",

        "text": "Just before Christmas I had a family meet-up type thing with my parents and aunts and uncles at a restaurant in southeast England. It was quite an upscale gastropub type place, which makes the standard of service particularly surprising.\n\nWe were attended to by Brenda and Bertha (statistically, those probably aren't their real names, but that's what I'll call them for the sake of the story). Brenda greeted us at the door, where my uncle - who is from Yorkshire - tells her, in his broad northern accent, that we have a reservation for half past one.\n\n\"***Harf*** ***parst*** one.\" replies Brenda.\n\n\"Sorry?\"\n\n\"It's pronounced 'harf parst', not 'haf past.'\"\n\n\"Er, alright then.\"\n\nWe just looked at each other for a bit, totally amazed that anyone would take it upon themselves to \"correct\" a customer's diction. I guess it was an attempt at a joke, but her face was completely deadpan so it just looked like she was scolding him.\n\nAnyways, she took us over to our table and - just as everyone is taking her coats off - she plonks the menus down in the middle of the table and barks \"drinks?\" at us. I ask what cider they have, she tells me there's Bulmers or Kopparberg, I order a pear Kopparberg. It seems that they were out of these though, because she brought me Bulmers anyway and tried to hide the fact by serving it already poured into a pint glass so I wouldn't see the bottle (and this definitely wasn't just how they served these things because someone who *had* ordered a Bulmers got a glass with ice and the bottle).\n\nShe takes our food order. I order a pulled pork burger and then hold my menu out expecting her to take it. She just walks straight off, leaving us with all the menus. Cool. That's the last we see of Brenda. Bertha would take care of us from now on.\n\nBertha trots out with our food. On her last trip from the kitchen, she stands at the end of the table clutching a burger and shouts \"bacon cheeseburger?\" I'm the only one without food at this point, so I tell her that I'd ordered the pulled pork burger. She peers at the bun for a bit and then declares \"oh, yeah, this is a pulled pork burger actually\" and starts advancing towards me with it. I protest that it really isn't because it was quite plainly bacon, only to be told \"nah, this is definitely yours. It was the only plate left in the kitchen.\" Fuck it, it had taken ages for the food to come out anyway so I just decided to stick with the bacon cheeseburger. Bertha then waddles off without offering any sauces or drinks.\n\nOne of my uncles intercepts her on her next trip through the dining room and asks her for some mustard. While she's at the table I ask for a Diet Coke. \"Well you'll have to wait a bit,\" she snaps at me \"I've got to go and get this mustard first.\" Brilliant, I was now being told off like I was a pestering child or something. I never got that Diet Coke, but my uncle did get his mustard - bizarrely served in what looked like an ashtray. Like, you could bathe a gerbil in this huge mustard receptacle, it was that big.\n\nWe get the bill and it lists a pulled pork burger instead of what I actually got. It's only a £2 difference but I was damned if I was paying it after she'd bullshitted me about it, so I tell her that what's on the bill is different to what I ordered. \"Why didn't you say?\" she snarls. I point out that I did in fact say when she gave it to me and she just walked off. \"You definitely ordered a bacon cheeseburger,\" she retorts, \"I remember you saying it and I have it written down.\" The fuck? I tell her that she didn't take our order and, even if what she was saying *was* true, then the bill was still wrong. \"Sorry, but you should have mentioned it at the time.\" And, with that, she walks off.\n\nI track down a manager and tell him about it. He changes the bill, but is totally unapologetic - offering me the excuse that \"the kitchen are a bit stressed out today because a lot of people have been sending food back.\" Er... OK, not sure how that qualifies as an excuse or is even relevant to this problem, but whatever.\n\nI used to work in restaurants and understand that people have off days and will always still tip even if there are a few fuck-ups, but this is the first time I've ever insisted that we leave a waitress absolutely nothing.\n\n",

So, can I just pay for the drink?  \nFS: No, because that's not the meal plan.  \nMe: But it's less than what the meal plan covers.  \nFS: No, you're getting a large drink.  \n\n&gt;Me, getting annoyed: And I'll pay for the drink.  \nFS: You have to pay for all of your food.  \nMe: I am paying, with the mealplan for the sandwich and chips, and I'll pay for the drink separate.  \nFS: Mealplan is a sandwich, chips, and a medium drink.  \nMe: Well can I put it back and get a medium?  \nFS: No, you have to pay for the food you've got.  \nMe: What if I go back and get a medium drink, and also pay for this large drink separately?  \nFS: I've already rung it up, you can't go back.  \nMe: Can I just speak to a manager?  \nFS: No, the managers are being trained today.  \n\n&gt;Me: OK, well this is silly.  This was an honest mistake, one for which I'm not completely to blame.  I'm not going to pay $8.50 and waste the mealplan.   \nFS: Fine, I'll have to take it.  (Proceeds to throw the entire tray in the trash, plates and sealed bag of chips included).  \n\nI walk back into the cafeteria, proceed to grab another sandwich, another bag of chips, and a small drink.  I check out at another counter and swipe my card for one mealplan meal without incident.  ",

Too bad, I really liked her, but the cost difference for in-network and out-of-network is substantial and I'm not made of money. So I go online and find a dentist nearby with pretty good reviews. The broken tooth happened on Sunday evening, I make an appointment for Wednesday morning. So far, so good.\n\nMy appointment is at 9:30. I show up at 9:15 to fill out the standard new patient paperwork. To their credit, they take me back to the chair at 9:40 and take an x-ray. Still doing okay, the dentist comes and looks at the x-ray, tells me they need to grind down the tooth and put on a crown. Okay, pretty much what I expected. I have to pay in advance. Most dentists I've been to usually bill you, but whatever, it's his business and he wants to make sure he gets paid.\n\nThen I wait. For about an hour. They don't give me the anesthetic until 10:45, and don't start working on the tooth until a few minutes after 11:00. Why did I make a 9:30 appointment if you weren't going to be able to start working on me until 11? It's not like they thought I was coming in for a routine cleaning and then discovered the problem, I told them when I made the appointment that I had a broken tooth. Still annoying, but not the end of the world.\n\nThe next day, the tooth is hurting. I think maybe it's just sore. Nope, the pain continues into the weekend. I call the \"emergency\" number, which doesn't work (it routes me back to their main number). I wait until Monday for the office to reopen, and they schedule me to come in to take a look at it on Wednesday at 9 am. I show up Wednesday at 8:55. I wait some more. They take me into the back at 9:40. Getting annoyed with the wait times. Dentist comes in, I tell him about the pain. He says, \"Yeah, I thought that might happen. I knew there was a pretty good chance you'd need a root canal.\" Why didn't you mention that before? If I had known how likely it was there was going to be a problem, I would have called right away when I started having pain.\n\nHe prescribes an antibiotic, and schedules me to have a root canal the following Friday (with his partner). I go pick up the prescription and start taking it right away. I give it a few days to start working, but the pain doesn't decrease. I call the \"emergency\" line again, it still doesn't work. Office was closed Monday for a holiday, and isn't open on Tuesday, so I can't get a hold of him until Wednesday. He prescribes a stronger antibiotic and a mild pain-killer. The pain-killer helps, the antibiotic doesn't.\n\nI go in Friday morning for the root canal. My appointment is at 8:30, right when the office opens. They can't possibly be running late if I'm the first appointment of the day, right? Wrong. The dentist (this is the partner, not the first dentist I saw) showed up at the office at 8:35. Takes me into the back at 8:45 and gives me the anesthetic. It doesn't work properly, and it hurts like all hell when the assistant pulls off my temporary crown. They decide the nerve is too inflamed and they can't do the root canal that day, and that I should take the antibiotics for another week and then they can try again. The assistant puts the temporary crown back on, which hurts even more. I reschedule the root canal for the following Friday and go home.\n\nI'm at home and the tooth hurts worse than it ever had before. Removing and reinserting the temporary crown has really irritated it, and I'm in a lot of pain. I take the prescribed painkiller (basically tylenol plus codeine, very mild) plus some ibuprofin; it doesn't reduce the pain at all. I call and tell them, they have me come back in. The dentist looks at it again and says there's nothing she can do since the anesthetic didn't work this morning, I just have to wait for the antibiotic to address the infection. I ask her about the pain, and she refuses to prescribe another pain-killer, telling me that one I already have should do just fine. I told her again that I already took it and it didn't help at all. She basically says \"That's too bad, the only other thing I can recommend if you're in that much pain is that you find an endodontist who can see you today.\"\n\nSo I sit in their waiting room and start calling. She had one that she recommended, but his office was almost an hour away, and I didn't want to drive that far in as much pain as I was in. I called my old dentist and she recommended two, but they were both closed on Friday. At this point I just started googleing and hoped that I found someone decent. Almost everybody was closed on Friday (do they all play golf or what?). After calling eight or nine offices, I finally find somebody who can take me at 4pm (it was about 1:30 at this point). Out of network so I'm going to have to pay more, but at this point I just need the pain to stop.\n\nI go see this guy at 4, and he was amazing. Turns out that the reason the anesthetic didn't work in the morning was because the dentist missed the proper injection site; this guy had me totally numb in ten minutes. He was so smooth that I actually dozed off in the middle of the procedure (who falls asleep during a root canal?). There's been no pain at all, either. I'm totally recommending him to everyone I know. The other guys, not so much.",

        "text": "I dunno why I'm thinking about my dog years, but this is gonna be my second post in two days about someone being unpleasant about the service dog I used to have. So, point of clarification; I do not have a service dog now, but during my teenage years it was a solution my parents were having me try. Ultimately I didn't like it and did not continue using the dog, but at the time of this story I had not yet come to that determination and was still actively using my dog in a medical capacity. \n\nSo, to set the scene a little; I was sixteen, and like most sixteen-year-old girls, I really enjoyed a day at the mall with a friend. There was a store that I'd been to a few times that was basically an eclectic mix of interesting stuff. Stress balls and wind chimes and t-shirts and a couple of saddles in the front window because we were in a horse-riding area. The counter was usually manned by an older guy who was pretty pleasant, but on this particular day there was a woman behind it.\n\nSo my friend and I walk in, the woman calls out to us that I can't bring my dog in there, and I do my casual \"It's a service dog\" explanation, delivered over my shoulder with a smile without breaking stride. I'm used to it. Doesn't even phase me anymore.\n\nWhat *does* phase me is when, five minutes later, I look up from the junk I'm perusing and see that this woman has come out from behind the counter and has not only managed to sneak up on me, but has decided that it'll be acceptable to grip my dog by the jacket (which boasted not one but *two* embroidered patches reading \"PLEASE DON'T PET ME I'M WORKING\") and use it as a handle to firmly and thoroughly pet him. The handle was necessary because he was giving her the canine version of a weird look and actively leaning away from her because he *knows* that vest time and fun time are two very different things. \n\nI yelp something along the lines of \"Stop that, he's a *service dog!*\" knock her arm away, and tuck the dog protectively behind me. (Side note- I have grabbed so many strangers by the hand it's not even funny. What the hell happened to *asking* before you touch a strange dog??) She gives me a look like I've just done something rude, goes for the dog again, and asserts that she was \"just petting him.\" I dodge, take a step back, dragging the dog with me, and tell her emphatically that you *can't* just *start petting* someone's service dog. My friend steps in to explain that yeah; she and I are bff's and even *she* doesn't get to pet my dog when his vest is on. \n\nThe lady gives me a look like I'm deliberately wronging her and suggests that maybe I'd better leave. I tell her she can't do that; she can't pet a service dog and she can't throw me out for having one, and she snaps back that she doesn't want my attitude in \"her\" store and I need to get out. Because I'm a teenager, I flip her off on the way out. And because I'm a seething cauldron of white-hot rage, I drag my friend with me down to the mall office. It's closed, so I pull out my phone and dial the number on the window. No one answers, so I leave a message. And then I realize I forgot my coat.\n\nSo we go back. I walk in ready and pumped for a screaming match because I'm still pissed as hell, and she's standing behind the counter with my coat laid out in front of her, arms crossed and glaring and clearly waiting for me. I start with \"Don't worry; I'm only here for my coat,\" and she bites back that that's good, because I'm banned, and I need to learn some respect for my elders. I reply that respect has nothing to do with it; *nobody pets a service dog!* She yells at me to get out, I yell back that I reported her and that she's violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, she threatens to call security, and I throw my coat to my friend and walk out flipping her off with *both* hands, including the one that's full of leash. \n\nThat pretty much killed the mood, so we call my dad to come pick us up, and we both rant to him about what happened. He drops my friend off, takes me home, and calls the mall office himself. This time someone answers, they give him the number of the store's owner, and he calls them. It turns out that it's the man who usually works there, and the next thing I know I'm hearing my dad confirming my physical appearance because the guy remembers me, likes me, and is wholly prepared to believe that his employee is in the wrong. He tells my dad that this is actually the second complaint that he's had about her, and that no matter which way things go for her employment-wise, he's not gonna put her on the floor again. \n\nI'd count that as a win, but the memory still fills me with rage.\n",

Now, since I left to go back to school, my manager quit and a really lazy guy took over. He's nice, but his girlfriend, the one who answered the phone, has always been a lazy jerk. \n\nSo I just called in to get a pizza, and I gave the order, and without asking how I was paying or giving me the chance to say, she hung up. So, I've gotta call back to give her the card info, all while being kinda pissed that I as the customer have to do this, when the person on phones should have asked. I always asked, no matter what, as do most people who work in pizza.\n\nI call back and tell her she forgot to ask for my card, and she says, and I quote \"Well, it's the customer's responsibility to say whether or not they're using a card.\"\n\nSo I shot back \"Oh, well that must have changed since I worked there.\"\n\nShe goes, \"Well, I've worked here for two years, this is how it's always been.\" Yet the location I called had only been open for maybe 8 months. At that point, I'm just praying she doesn't spit in my food, since she's literally one of the rudest people I've ever had to work with. I've really half a mind to call the owner tomorrow, I know he'd flip his lid if he knew that she was treating customers that way.",

Also, it's significant that I'm not white. \n\nJust after the first two customers ahead of me get served, she walks horizontally down the counter and steps right in front of me in line.

Hope you guys enjoy.\n\n**Some Background** I don't work in retail, as I don't have the saintly patience required to put up with anyone's daily B.S., ~~but~~ so I feel this is the perfect sub to post this.    The event took place earlier ~~this~~ last afternoon while out shopping at [*Big Supermarket Chain*] for party supplies. My sincerest apologies for any grammar/spelling mistakes made.    \n\nI'll try to keep out any unnecessary details. Those involved in the the event shall be referred to as Patient Employee (**PE**), Obviously the Mom (**OM**), and Kid (**K**).    \n\nSo, my friend and I are just minding our own business,  looking for paper plates and plastic cups, when we see a small child sprinting past the aisle we're in. Moments later, a loud **BANG** is heard, and, being an obvious cause for concern, we come jogging around the corner.From our viewpoint, we see the kid sitting among a pile of ruined snack cakes and the flimsy plastic shelf the cakes were displayed on. It looked liked the kid hadn't noticed the \"Wet Floor\" sign on the ground (or the kid couldn't read. He looked about 5-6 years old). \n\n   &gt;**K:** *Approx. 12 seconds of silence followed by the most obnoxious bawling I've ever heard*\n\nMy friend and I look for a parent, but no-one stands out.  Luckily, **PE** shows up and attempts to calm the kid down.  \n\n   &gt;**PE:** \"Uhmm, excuse me, who's the parent of this child?\"    \n\n*Awkward silence follows.*  \n\n   &gt;**K:** *Starts bawling again.* (Shouts) \"MOMMYYYYY!\"  \n\n**SUDDENLY** Mom pops out from one of the aisles farther away, sees **K**, and begins sprinting towards him like a madwoman (Kudos to this lady for being able to run so quickly in heels, btw).  \n\n  &gt;**OM:** \"OH MY GOD (**K**), ARE YOU ALRIGHT!? WHAT HAPPENED!?\" etc.  \n\n  &gt;**K:** *Points at* **PE** \"It's *HER* fault!\"  \n\n  Say what???  \n\n  **PE** directs a *clearly* panicked look in the direction of **OM**  \n\n  **PE** tries to clarify the situation to **OM**, and explain that she had nothing to do with it, but **OM** raises her hand to stop her.  \n\n  &gt;**K** pipes up-  \n\n  &gt;**K:** \"Yeah she did, mommy, yeah she did-\"  \n\n   Apparently, **K** thinks he can get away with it... \n\n   At this point, I'm wondering where the hell this kid gets his logic, because he can't seem to wrap his little head around the fact that it wasn't anyone else's fault. My friend murmurs, \"Dafuq is this kids problem?\" next to me as I shrug.  \n\n   Surprisingly enough, **OM** didn't begin immediately shouting **PE**'s ears off. Instead, she takes a look at the mess on the ground, and picks **K** back onto his feet.  \n\n   &gt;**OM:** \"Were you running in the store again?\"  \n\n   &gt;**K:** *Shakes head to the point where I fear he's going to rattle out what little brains he has left*   \n\n   &gt;**OM:** (Turns to **PE**) \"I'm sorry about the damage, I'll pay for it. But would you mind bringing me a stool first?\"  \n\n   &gt;**PE:** \"Okay... Sure.\" (?????)  \n\n   Not one minute later, **PE** comes back with a stool in hand.  \n\n   &gt;**PE:** *Hands the stool to* **OM** \"Will this work?\"  \n\n   &gt;**OM:** \"Yes, that's perfect, thanks. Would you mind bringing your manager over so we can work out the details on what needs to be paid for?\"  \n\n   **PE** *nods at this and walks away to fetch her manager.*  \n\n   As soon as **PE** leaves, **OM** sets the stool facing the wall and tells **K** to sit there and stay in Time-Out until his mess has been paid for, and that he \"wasn't getting any goodies for a whole week.\"  \n\n   Poor kid looked like he was going to cry his eyes out again, but made no objections and sat down while employees came by and cleaned up the mess.  \n\n   A couple of people (including me and my buddy) gave her a round of applause.  \n\n   **TL:DR** Little kid breaks store property, tries to blame it on innocent employee.

        "text": "So, when I was a teenager I had a service dog. My parents thought it would help me with a medical issue, but the inconvenience far outweighed the benefits and I stopped using the dog once I became an adult. But that was still plenty of time for me to have a bunch of *really, really* painful dog-centered interactions.\n\nWhen I was fifteen my mother and I went on a road trip which involved a three-day driving marathon both ways. On the evening of day two we stopped at a hotel and my mother sent me inside with the money to see if they had any rooms available while she stayed in the car. A point of clarification- service dogs are required by law to be allowed into any area that their handlers are allowed into, except in cases of safety. So I couldn't take my dog into an operating room or a welding shop, but a hotel is obligated to allow a service dog to stay.\n\nI walked in with my dog wearing his bright blue vest with SERVICE DOG embroidered along the top and PLEASE DON'T PET ME I'M WORKING on each of the sides around a picture of a hand in a red circle with a line through it. He stuck so close to my side that he brushed against my leg occasionally, and when I got up to the counter I made a small \"down\" motion with two fingers and he immediately flopped to the floor. He was pretty visibly a service dog, but a surprising number of people still questioned him.\n\nSo I asked the receptionist if they had any rooms available, and she said that they did, but that they didn't allow dogs.\n\nMe: \"Oh, he's a service dog.\"\n\nReceptionist: \"Who's dog is he?\"\n\nMe: \"He's my service dog. And do you have two queens? My mom's out in the car.\"\n\nReceptionist: \"We do...but we can *only* allow dogs which are medically necessary.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, he's my service dog.\"\n\nReceptionist: \"Well, I'm gonna need to see some documentation.\"\n\nSo I unzipped the pocket on his vest and took out his service dog ID, which had a photo of him, his training information, and listed me as his handler. She stared at it for a good twenty seconds before holding it up like she was showing it to me.\n\nReceptionist: \"I'm gonna photocopy this, and my manager will see it when he comes in.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay.\"\n\nReceptionist: \"If he doesn't like it you'll have to leave. It's illegal to impersonate a service dog.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, I know.\"\n\nReceptionist: \"It carries a fine.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, $500, right?\"\n\nReceptionist: \"So, you still want a room?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, two queens?\"\n\nReceptionist: \"...*oh*kay.\"\n\nShe made a big show of photocopying the card, handed it back to me, and gave me the room keys. Shockingly, we didn't hear anything from the manager and were never asked to leave.",

Wasn't going to buy anything, was really just there to get out of the cold for a minute, but then I saw a super soft, super comfy scarf that was $30, but was just below a 50% off sign. Took it to the register, told the guy that I didn't need a bag, it was freezing and I was going to wear it immediately. \n\n\nIt rang up for $30 and I was informed the 50% off sign was actually for the shirts above it. I told him \"Oh, that's fine, I'll pass. Thanks anyway.\"\n\n\nInstead of letting it go, he says, \"You know what, you're right, it really is cold outside. I'll give it to you for 50% off.\"\n\n\nSo I bought it, and my neck was warm the rest of the day. Thanks man, you did me a solid. ",

        "text": "Hey folks so some quick info before I jump into the tale. I live in a suburban city outside a major city in Canada. There is a large and popular retail pizza franchise that serves good food at an okay price. Most people order from them for their reliability and because they guarantee the food will be made in time. This is where I come in.\nIt's Friday night and my mom wants to know if I want her to get pizza on her way home. I say sure and order the food online so she can pick it up without having to wait. I place the order and notice that they give a guarantee that it will be ready on 20 mins or it's free. I text my mom so she's aware of the guarantee then continue watching tv. About 25 mins goes by when my mom calls telling me that the store won't honor the guarantee so she's coming home. I meet her at the end of the driveway, get in the car, and tell her we're going back. We get there and she sends me in since she's not confrontational.  \n\nI walk in to see about 10 people waiting in the store, receipts in hand, and all of them looking a little flustered. I approach the counter and speak to a clerk who looks like he's maybe 17. He's wearing hipster frames (with no lenses), a dirty apron, hat, and a rather entitled look. We'll call him WH for wannabe hipster. WH finishes processing an order then calls me up. I walk over and calmly explain about the order, guarantee, and how my mother was told they would not honor it. WH looks at me with an annoyed look then states that the machine that receives the orders stopped working for a couple minutes so they won't be honoring the time guarantee. The rest of the interaction goes as follows:    \n\ntiff383 'I understand that a glitch may have occurred but you clearly received the order and you need to honor your \ncompany's guarantee.'  \n\nWH &gt; 'No, I don't care about what the computer said, if you want you can call head office.'  \nNow this company uses a corporate call center to take orders then distributes the orders to either the nearest store or the one you select. Which means by calling this call center number I'm speaking to head office. So instead of calling the head office number he gives me which would be closed by this time I call the call center. The rep and I speak for a couple of minutes in which time I explain the situation. She looks up the store and order and confirms that the interruption was not enough to void the guarantee. So with phone in hand I approach WH.  \n\ntiff383 &gt; 'Your head office says you need to honor the guarantee.'  \n\nWH &gt; 'No we don't. The computers where down.'\n\nHe then proceeds to ignore me while looking really pissed off. Up to this point I've been calm, respect, although firm. I understand it's a hard job having worked in customer service for a few years. I usually do my best to be understanding as well as compassionate. But this little troglodyte has now disrespected my mother, myself, and is being dishonest. It's now on to the break of dawn.\n\ntiff383 'Hey! Your head office is telling you to honor this order, so hand over the food.'\n\nWH looks at me then turns around to fold boxes. At this point the other 5 or so employees are looking on with both fear and anticipation. The customers who I'm beginning to realize are in the same situation of being told the guarantee is not being honored, are now looking on with keen interest. Now as I'm getting ready to give WH a verbal smack down the customer service rep on the phone tells me to pay and she'll reimburse me. There's no way I'm giving this location my money. So the rep tells me her manager is going to call the store.\n\ntiff383 'Hey the head office manager is about to call you and confirm that you have to honor the guarantee.'\n\nJust as I finish the store's phone rings. WH takes it in the back so I can't hear. In the meantime I tell the waiting people that head office will reimburse them if they have paid or that they should be getting their pizza for free. At this point WH who has been listening comes out, with my order made, boxed, and waiting. He slides it to me with a look of hatred.\n\ntiff383 'Thank you.'\n\nIf only looks could kill. WH brushes me off with a mumble. The waiting customers though are all standing up and I'm encouraging them all to fight for their promise of free pizza. WH is glaring and I look him dead in the eye as I back out the door and yell the words that set the store into a panicked frenzy:\n'FREE PIZZA FOR EVERYONE!'\n\nedit: Formatting",

        "text": "Customer here. Frequent lurker in /r/talesfromretail, but I've never posted. Apologies in advance if there are formatting issues.\n\n\nI recently had a really awesome retail experience. My fiancé and I bought some snowshoes last year during an end-of-season sale, but didn't get to use them until a few weeks ago. We were all geared up and had driven thirty minutes or so to a park to go hiking but when I went to put on my snowshoes, one of the buckles popped out of the contraption that holds your shoe in place. Basically, it wasn't broken, it was a manufacturing error that no one could have ever noticed unless they tried to use the snowshoes--and we hadn't when we bought them because there wasn't any snow. I am not from a place where it snows a lot, and I had been really looking forward to snowshoeing, so I was pretty disappointed.\n\n\nWith little hope, I called the store where we bought them: a huge, privately owned outdoor gear place, and explained to customer service what happened. It had been nine months since we bought the shoes, and I couldn't find the receipt, so I wasn't expecting much. But a customer service employee told me that since we still had the tags with the store name on them (because we didn't cut them off until we took the snowshoes out for our hike), he could exchange them for me. I was ecstatic!!\n\n\nWhen I got to the store, the guy I talked to was helping someone, but a lady was at the CS desk too, and was expecting me. She told me to pick out another pair of the same item and bring them back for the exchange, which I happily did. When I got back, the guy I had originally spoken to helped me. There was a current sale on the shoes for less than I had originally paid, and he gave me the difference in store credit \"for the inconvenience.\" I thanked him profusely, and the CS lady too, and then went to get a new pair of gloves with the store credit.\n\n\nAt checkout, I was still glowing. I tried to tell the cashier that I was so pleased and that I shopped there a lot and would continue to, because I was so happy with how I was treated. I mentioned the CS employees by name, and how kind and helpful they had been, and asked them to tell the manager what a great job they were doing. She (and another employee who wasn't on a register but standing near her) listened with stinkface, and I finally realized they were just waiting for me to complain about something. I had to repeat myself twice, and they still didn't really know how to react. I left, and heard one say to the other \"I thought she was mad at [CS name].\"\n\n\nI just got really upset after leaving and realizing that retail employees seem to expect complaints as the normal feedback. I've never had anything but great experiences at this store, and I always try to tell them. I found the store's social media accounts, and commented there about how awesome they are (and mentioned my CS guy by name), so hopefully someone saw that.\n\n\nBig hugs to the awesome retail folks out there. I appreciate you!",

I told her that was the one I wanted. She took me up to the front of the store and grabbed one for me, but again there was NO price anywhere for it.\n\nWhen checking out, the cashier rung me up and the price was off. By over $40.

I was like \"Uhh, that's not the price I was quoted\", we talked for a second and had me follow him to find the employee who helped me.\n\nTurns out that when she started the job, that tablet was on sale for $139.99, so she thought it was the regular price. Because of her mistake, I got the tablet for the price I was quoted, which was nice.\n\nBut I can't help but think she may have been punished for misquoting the price.",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I went to the local mall today to look at engagement rings. I have a very specific idea of what I want and knew it would be hard to find something similar and knew getting it custom made would likely be expensive. I also do not want my boyfriend spending very much on a piece of jewelry. We looked at several of the stores that we happened by and all of the sales people seemed helpful. \n\nWe were walking back where we came in and saw one more chain jewelry place and decided to stop in and see what they had on offer. We were greeted right away and asked what we were looking for and taken immediately to the sapphire jewelry. So far so good. Things went downhill from there. We were explaining that I wanted something in white gold with a small half carat sapphire as the main stone. She showed us what they had, none of which was really what I was looking for, and then she explained that they could alter a few of the rings to be more like I was wanting which sounded great. Then we started talking about stones. I mentioned that I was fine with lab created diamonds which she insisted were actually just cubic zirconia and that diamonds couldn't be man made... strike one. I let it slide. I don't really care much about diamonds and the ones in the ring were so small it hardly mattered to me. Then we were talking about the sapphire. My boyfriend mentioned that we were again fine with lab created. Her response was that we could do that, but we would want to get a natural stone since it was for such a special occasion and you're essentially getting a fake stone if you get lab created and at that point it was basically a bubblegum ring. At this point I was completely put off. My boyfriend was absolutely livid but we continued to stay and listen to her spiel about how we could do this or that to the rings they had or we could bring in a picture of what we wanted and get an estimate of what it would cost to get the ring I envisioned made. Throughout this she asked several times what we wanted to spend (which we didn't even really know, it was more of a you find what you want and we'll work it out later situation) and mentioned that we could get the ring made but that it wouldn't be cheap and if we were looking for something cheaper we could do lab stones, so on and so forth. \n\nHonestly, I get that there's most likely commissions for each sale you deal with in a jewelry place like that, but she was being outright rude. The best way to lose a sale is to repeatedly tell the customer that the ring they want is cheap junk. I felt like she thought I was a tacky, poor, and low class just because I don't want to spend a fortune on a ring. I personally hate jewelry so I don't want to have something that costs a months pay on my finger, to me it's a waste of money. I would rather put more money down on a house than have a big shiny rock on my hand. Luckily I found a nice ring set that I think I could work with at another jewelry place and they also can get a piece custom made if we still wanted the ring I'd been thinking of. ",

Maybe it's my retail experience, but I know there's no reason to be a jerk to the people helping you out. \n\nYesterday marked the launch of a new handheld video game system. I was very much looking forward to this release and had made a (flawed) plan to buy one. I say \"flawed\" because I failed to pre-order one of the systems and relied on my local video game retailer to have gotten more units than were previously pre-ordered. But the manufacturer had other plans. \n\nI showed up at the mall, 4-month-old daughter in tow, at 9:20 yesterday morning. The store opened at 10, so I wanted to be the first in line in an attempt to overcome my failure to pre-order. And I was. A few others showed up after me during my wait, including an impatient-looking middle-aged guy in a hoodie, but I was first. \n\nGate opens, we file toward the counter. I ask if they had any extra systems that weren't reserved and was told that they had ONE unreserved unit. ONE. And it was mine. Score. \n\nPause. I turn around to the middle-aged guy in line behind me and asked him something that was gnawing at me during our wait: \"Are you getting a system for yourself, or is it for your kid?\" \n\nIt was for his kid. Crap. He goes on to tell me that his son had worked really hard to get his grades up and to save all the money he needed to buy the system. Dad offered to work from home yesterday so that he could be at the store at open, to be sure to get one. Crap again. \n\nSo I told him to take my spot in line and get the system for his son. I remember how excited I used to get on big release days when I was a kid and how heartbroken I was when something was sold out. Go ahead, make your kid happy, dude. Maybe someone will do the same for my daughter someday. \n\nI've seen this situation get very ugly very quickly before, and I didn't want to put anyone through that. And having a positive effect on a family's day made me happy. Plus, the guy handed me a $25 gift card. Totally unnecessary, but I definitely appreciated it. Looks like I'll be able to put that toward my purchase when new shipments go out!",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/2vvgie/a_tale_of_incompetent_tech_support_xlink_from/",
        "text": "So, first off, I'm what you would consider the bane of your existence - a power user. Smart enough to not really need tech support, but when I do, it's a nightmare for the poor techie. In general, if I need assistance, it's because some hardware dun goofed. So these are ReverseTalesofTechSupport, I guess.\n\n**1: Ram replacement**\n\nSo, I purchased a lovely Clevo and after much back-and-forth, it transpired that I was to be given 16 gb of 1600MHz ram. Unfortunately, they only had the regular MHz ram at the time. Odd, considering they were advertising it as such, but whatever, I rolled with it - the owner gave me my lappy, ordered the proper frequency RAM and asked me to drop by in a week or so.\n\nI did, and was greeted by a 40ish something tech. I informed him of my situation, he went to verify with his boss and took my laptop away. Strike 1: Whenever something trivial such as changing a couple of modules requires going to the back of the shop, I'm immediately suspicious. Strike 2: It took him a good 20 minutes to change the modules. He got back and told me I'm good to go. Not so fast, buddy. As is good practice, I fired it up there and then, and opened Speccy to verify that I had indeed received the correct amount and type of RAM. My attention was very quickly drawn to the DRAM Frequency entry: 798.1 MHz.\n\n**Me**: \"Are you sure this is 1600 MHz?\" [I now know that this is due to coupling of some sort, but at the time I did not]\n\n**40Tech**: \"uhhhh let me see .... hmm.\"\n\nHe vanishes to the back, presumably to check the boxes (not a bad idea) and emerges 10 minutes later with the packaging.\n\n**40Tech**: \"seems so ... but hmm... why would it show that?\"\n\nCue 5 minutes of digging around in my Device Manager, he fixated on the fact that I have \"high definition audio device\" under Sound,video and game controllers. At this point I was fed up, and about to be late for something else so I told him I'll check it at home and phone them if it is indeed the wrong kind.\n\nMy point is - you'd expect a (presumably) experienced tech to know about dual-bus frequencies.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**2: Ram replacement 2**\n\nSo, a week after the incident in the previous part, one of my modules fried itself. No idea how, it probably took umbrage at being abused heavily on Autodesk stuff.\nI called the shop in advance to make sure they had the RAM in stock, and drove off. While I was parking, I had an idea. I quickly opened the back of my laptop up, and took a couple of shots of the modules there, as well as serial numbers and a timestamp [googling \"date and time right now\" on my spare phone]. This turned out to be a brilliant idea..\n\n**40Tech**: \"What seems to be the problem?\"\n\n**Me**: \"Hi, I called in earlier, one of my RAM modules is bust\"\n\nAgain, 40Tech took it to the back and after half an hour, returned.\n\n**40Tech**: \"All done\".\n\n**Me**: \"Mind if I fire it up to check?\"\n\n**40Tech**: \"No need, it's all there, and we're kind of busy\".\n\nNow, this set off red flags immediately. Whenever someone says there's no need to check ... that's a sign there's probably something wrong. They were also not busy - the shop was segmented into 3 different support areas, and while the other two had 1 customer waiting each, his area (repairs), did not. I fired it up anyway, while he looked at me as if I had just shat on his head.\n\nBefore then, I had never seen a Win 8.1 BSOD. It's quite pretty, I must admit.\n\n**Me**: \"Something's wrong here buddy\"\n\n**40Tech**: \"You must have a virus or something\"\n\n**Me**: \"Yeah .... no.\"\n\nI then turned it off, flipped it around, took out my screwdriver (most of us tend to fall into the habit of carrying a phillips-head with us wherever we go /sigh) and opened it up. That moron had broken off one of the RAM clips and, more than that, inserted one incorrectly!\n\n**40Tech**: \"That's why you should leave repairs to professionals like me. See, you must have broken it off. That's not covered by warranty\"\n\nNow, due to the incidents which happened in the past, I had the owner's phone number. I phoned him in front of 40Tech and asked him to come around because we have a problem. The owner also happens to be somehow related to my dad [3rd cousin removed or some shit], so he came pronto.\n\n**GoodguyOwner**: \"Hi, Zircon. What happened?\"\n\n**40Tech**: \"He broke some parts and filled his computer with viruses, and is blaming me for it\".\n\n**Me**: \"Nope. This guy is incompetent and won't admit to his mistakes. I have proof that my computer was fine before it came here\".\n\nNow, GoodguyOwner means well, but he's technologically clueless. However, even the most moronic of people can recognise when something is out of shape, as was indeed the case with the clips and modules - and my pictures were more than enough to convince him of this. He was very upset about the whole incident, apologised profusely, and told me to come back in a week for a repair (with emphasis on the gratis nature of said repair). He also knew that I was a gamer, so he gave me a DeathAdder on the spot for my troubles.\n\nA week later, I was paired with 20Tech, who clearly knew his shit. I asked to accompany him while he swapped out the motherboard, and he was more than willing to accommodate - as a result of which, I learned a lot. He also mentioned that 40Tech no longer worked there and apologised again on behalf of the owner and the business. I was also given a spare 8GB 1600 MHz module for my time. Turns out that it wasn't the first time 40Tech had fucked up, but no one else had managed to prove anything. The owner had actually installed secret cameras in the repair area because he was sick of losing business over such claims. Once 40Tech was gone, he announced their presence to the rest of the employees - although they possessed varying levels of competence, they were honest, and didn't mind it a bit, rather - they welcomed it as a chance to prove that they indeed did not fuck up on their part.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**3: The dead USB hub\n**\nLo and behold, my lovely 4-port USB3.0 hub (housing KB+M) decided to fuck up for some reason. I inserted a pendrive, and it suddenly made a \"pop\" sound and refused to work anymore. I sighed, reconnected my keyboard and mouse to another hub and carried on. However, my keyboard developed a disconnection sydrome - it would randomly disconnect, then reconnect, making normal use tolerable, but gaming impossible.\nWhelp, off to #shop we go.\n\n**Me**: \"Hi, I think I fried my hub, and it also damaged my keyboard\".\n\n**NewTech**: \"Well, if you fried it, it's not covered by warranty.\"\n\n**Me**: \"I understand that some user-induced damage is indeed not covered, but a USB hub should not die upon the insertion of a pendrive\"\n\n**NewTech**, with much huffing and puffing: \"Well, let's take a look\".\n\nAfter 5 minutes, NewTech declared, with much pomp, that the hub was fine, but the transformer was shot. He pointed to it and emphasised the blinking nature of its light.\n\n**Me**: \"I don't think so, hubs work without power supplies just fine, they just need that for heavier usage such as external drives. I know for a fact that that particular hub works without external power.\"\n\n**NewTech**: \"Nonsense, a hub cannot work without power\".\n\n*raised eyebrows on my part, but whatever, let him learn a valuable lesson in humility on his own*\n\n30 minutes of swapping different transformers later, he found one that worked. [Side note: Why do techs keep faulty equipment around?]\n\nMuch to NewTech's dismay, the hub was, and remained dead, despite having adequate power. He silently returned it to its package and said \"Sir, it seems this is dead. We'll gladly replace it under warranty but ... we don't have one of these in stock right now. We can, however, credit you it's full amount and you can purchase another one\".\n\nGood salesmanship on his part, considering that the only other USB3.0 hub they had in stock was an IcyBox product that cost twice as much as mine.\n\n**Me**: \"Nope, I want that. I don't mind waiting for a replacement though.\"\n\nNewTech looked dismayed (probably lost some commission % or something).\n\n**Me**: \"Now, about this keyboard ....\"\n\n**NewTech**: \"Oh sure, all our products MUST be broken through no fault of your own, right? Right this way then, *sir*\"*.\n\n**NewTech**: \"Shopguy, please order a replacement KB+ hub for *sir*\".\n\n**Shopguy**: \"sure thing.\"\n\n*sidenote: In my language, we sometimes use \"Sir\", and sometimes use \"*Is-sinjur*\", which means \"*the rich one*\" - which is often used to refer to a customer with respect. However, inflection can also permit it to be used to express sarcasm. Italicised \"*sir*\" refers to the latter.\n\nThe point of story3 is that I understand that Techsupport doesn't know every single detail about everything under the sun, but surely something as simple as USB hubs not requiring power to function is a basic occurrence. I also observed that he tried a plethora of different supplies, including a 15V transformer, when mine only required 5 (clearly marked on the device). A phone call to GoodguyOwner later on in the day resulted in the guy being placed on extra training - apparently he was new/ under some apprenticeship program, and had attitude problems at times, but was otherwise a reasonably competent guy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nNot sure if these fit here, but I thought it would be an interesting change to see how some TechSupport guys can, and do, fuck up.",

        "text": "I would try to keep this short, but it seems like whenever I do it ends up even longer.  Apologies if that's what happens.\n\nMy cell phone carrier is named after a bug and lately seems to like little fuzzy animals in their commercials.  I'll admit, they're kind of cute, but now my blood can't help but to boil whenever I see a commercial.\n\nSo, a little less than a year ago (March of last year) I bought a new cell phone from Fuzzy Monster Wireless (FMW).  Because this company is prepaid, I bought the phone unsubsidized out of pocket.  I want to say it cost roughly $500.  When I did, the sales rep told me that they were merging with Great Big American Phone and Telegraph Company (GBAPTC).  Not really as a \"just to warn you\" thing, just part of our conversation and banter while working on activating the phone, I guess.\n\nSo, the months pass by, and I see a few changes in FMW, and how I'm basically treated as a separate company compared to new customers (like my wife) after things cut over with GBAPTC.  The biggest one was a couple months ago when I started getting text message warnings that they were cutting off the music service FMW provided before getting bought by GBAPTC (which wasn't ever offered to them).  Annoying, since I was paying the same amount, and their alternative was a subscription service costing an extra $6/month, but whatever.  I can use Spotify.  Not worth my trouble.\n\nI also figured I'd check and see what plan options are these days, thinking maybe I could save a few bucks a month.  I then see a notice that \"As early as 2015\" FMW is shutting down their old CDMA system and everyone will have to use the new FMW system.  At this point, I think an online support transcript will be the best way to take it from here.\n\n&gt;You have been connected to Representative. \n\n&gt;Representative: Welcome to Fuzzy Monster Wireless chat group support, my name is \n\n&gt;Representative. How can I help you? \n\n&gt;Me: Hello - I am an old Fuzzy Monster customer, and saw a note on the website that the CDMA network will be cut as early as March 2015, and my phone would be unusable at that point \n\n&gt;Representative: Ok, let me do my best to help you out with this right now. \n\n&gt;Representative: May I have your first and last name please? \n\n&gt;Me: Me \n\n&gt;Representative: Thank you Mr. You. \n\n&gt;Representative: May I have your phone number please? \n\n&gt;Me: ########## \n\n&gt;Representative: Thank you Mr. You. \n\n&gt;Representative: May I have your authorization ID number please? \n\n&gt;Me: ###### \n\n&gt;Representative: Thanks, I got it. \n\n&gt;Representative: Just give me a second please, let me work on this right away. \n\n&gt;Representative: Ok here we go! I have your account already with me. \n\n&gt;Representative: I can see that you have the Samsung Galaxy S4 Black, right? \n\n&gt;Me: correct \n\n&gt;Me: I bought it about a year ago, and do not want it to be a paperweight so quickly \n\n&gt;Representative: Well let me tell you that at this time, we have a new Fuzzy Monster network and with this new Fuzzy Monster network, we have more benefits for you to enjoy. \n\n&gt;Representative: This is GSM network but your phone is not compatible with this. \n\n&gt;Me: but then I need to buy a whole new phone \n\n&gt;Representative: All you need to do to migrate to this new service is to get a new GSM phone. \n\n&gt;Representative: All you need to do to migrate to this new service is to get a new GSM phone. \n\n&gt;Me: gee, all I have to do is spend a few hundred dollars? \n\n&gt;Representative: So you do not need to spend a lot of more money to get a new GSM phone. \n\n&gt;Representative: It depends on what new phone you want. \n\n&gt;Me: I want the exact same phone I have now \n\n&gt;Representative: You can trade in your existing CDMA phone so you will get a special discount on the new GSM phone at a main Fuzzy Monster store. \n\n&gt;Me: right now I see that costs $429.99. Is that discount $429.99 as well? \n\n&gt;Representative: The new Samsung Galaxy S4 Black is for $429.99. \n\n&gt;Representative: That is the full price but like I said you have differents ways to get a new GSM phone. \n\n&gt;Representative: All you need to do is to take the phone to a Fuzzy Monster store because they need to evaluate your phone and it the end, they let you know how much you can get for your current phone. \n\n&gt;Me: but unless I can get a new equivalent phone for free, I'm still paying just to keep the service I already have, which I expected to be good for longer than a single year \n\n&gt;Representative: You have time to migrate to this new Fuzzy Monster network until March of this year. \n\n&gt;Me: wow, a whole month! \n\n&gt;Me: how long have I had this phone? \n\n&gt;Representative: But after this, you will get more benefits to enjoy with this new network. \n\n&gt;Me: I'm perfectly happy with my current network. \n\n&gt;Representative: I can see you got this account since 03/16/2014. \n\n&gt;Representative: We know you are happy now but we are upgrading services. \n\n&gt;Me: in fact, my wife is on new Fuzzy Monster. When we go to a small town in Iowa to visit her family, we have 0 service. At least I could roam before \n\n&gt;Representative: With this new network, you are not going to get charged for roaming fee anymore because we have 99% of coverage inside the USA. \n\n&gt;Representative: Besides that, we have affordable plans with discounts and promotions such as the group save up to $100 monthly so you can add 5 lines for $100 every month. \n\n&gt;Representative: Finally, you can keep the same phone number that you have now on your CDMA account. \n\n&gt;Representative: If she is having issues like that we need to know what is going on with her new phone. \n\n&gt;Me: I'm done - there's no longer anything you can do for me. Good day. \n\n&gt;Representative: The only option we have for you is the migration sir. \n\n&gt;Me: look at the coverage map for Smalltown, IA. She's outside of that \"99%\" area.\n\nMaybe I got a little snarky, but I think it's understandable here.  Oh, and I still haven't been notified that they're doing this.  I had to reach out to their website and notice some fine print, like Arthur Dent finding out his home is going to be demolished to make way for a bypass.  They have literally been more proactive telling me that I won't be able to listen to music with their service than they were that their entire cell phone network is being killed off in about a month!  Also, I saw a few similar stories on FMW's Facebook page.  Most people are being offered in the neighborhood of $100 credit.",

Decided I'd just go to my work and order something as its cheaper than going anywhere else thanks to employee discount. So, technically this means I'm a customer :P\n\nI walk in to only one other customer at the counter who's talking to a manager I've not seen before. She was from another store picking up product she was going to borrow from our store. The customer begins complaining to her about the fact that he refuses to set foot inside her store ever again because the General Manager pissed him off by shorting him a few fries in his medium fry container. And when I say shorting some fries, I mean he missed out on like, 5 french fries. No big deal, but to him it was like someone just ruined his world. He told the manager he had something to give to her GM, and proceded to give her the bird with his hand being literally an inch from her face.\n\nSkip ahead a little bit to where he's ordering, I overhear him say that he specifically wants his burger patty to be made a specific way. The employee at the register says okay and that was that. I ordered my food, briefly talking to my other manager who walked up about the rude ass customer that just made a mockery of the manager who was visiting.\n\nI sit down waiting for my food and a moment later, rude customer's food is called. He walks up, opens his wrapped sandwich, and all hell breaks loose.\n\n&gt;Customer: What the F***!!! I TOLD YOU I WANTED MY BURGER MADE LIKE THIS! DOES THIS LOOK LIKE I ASKED?\n\nHe literally threw the burger at the Manager on duty. Then began throwing racial slurs at the cook.\n\n\n\nAre people honestly this horrible? His reaction is absolutely horrible. I don't think I've ever seen anyone be so vile. I mean I can understand wanting what you paid/asked for, but to throw the sandwich at someone who had nothing to do with it? Let alone throwing the sandwich in the first place? Really?",

I also want to say that I remained very calm and collected throughout all of the phone conversations that took place; I work in customer service, I know how shitty it can be.\n\nI recently had some money stolen from my debit account, and am in the process of trying to get it back. Unfortunately, my bank doesn't have any physical locations, it's all online, which means customer service is all on the phone.\n\nWhen I discovered all of my money had been stolen, I called immediately and was redirected three different times before finally being told I had to wait three days before filing a dispute, but that I could do it over the phone. No problem, I'll wait. I looked over some of the paperwork that I received when I opened my account, and felt pretty stupid when I saw \"you must wait two to three days before filing a dispute.... To file a dispute, call (number).\" I made sure to closely read everything else on there so I wouldn't make the same mistake again.  \n\nThree days later I called back and was sent around the maze of \"to talk to X department, press 2\" once again. After talking to FIVE more people, all with thick Indian accents that I don't think could understand me, I was put on hold again and then talked to someone with a very thick southern USA accent who told me I could only file disputes online. Great, wasted an hour and went around the phone maze  for nothing, but whatever. Tried to log in, but was met with \"THIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED, CALL FOR ASSISTANCE.\" FML. So I call, AGAIN, and was told that when I called the first time someone deactivated my account since the card had been compromised, but I cannot file a dispute unless it's activated. The woman on the phone reactivates my account so I can file the dispute before deactivating it again, and hangs up.  \n\nI filed the dispute, but was not given any kind of confirmation. A couple days later, this starts to worry me, since the account had almost all of my money in it, so I called again to confirm that everything went through. I pushed \"4 to talk to a representative about fraudulent activity on your card\" and then \"3 to talk to a representative about a dispute that has already been filed,\" thinking that was the correct option. I guess not.  \n\n&gt; Phone Lady (PL): Hello, my name is Betty *(Yeah, I'm sure it is)*, how can I help you?    \n&gt; Me: Hi, my name is Me, I filed a dispute online a couple of days ago and would like to check the status on it.  \n&gt; PL: Customer service can NOT do that.  \n&gt; Me: Ok... Well I just want to know how long it might take to get my money back, it was stolen five days ago and my bills are going to be due soon.  \n&gt; PL: I am NOT allowed to provide you with a timeline!  \n&gt; Me: Ok... Well is there someone I can talk to about the dispute?  \n&gt; PL: This is CUSTOMER SERVICE. I CAN'T check your records!  \n&gt; Me: Who can check my records then?  \n&gt; PL: *very sarcastically* Um, the FRAUD department!   \n&gt; Me: Can you connect me with someone in the fraud department then?  \n&gt; PL: Sure, FINE!  \n&gt; Me: Thanks...  \n\nThen I get a new set of options... \"Press 1 to file a dispute, press 2 to speak with a representative in the fraud department\" so I press 2. \"We're sorry, but there is no one in the fraud department to answer your call. Your call is valuable to us. If there is anything else you would like assistance with, press 8\" and I press 8... but get the same \"Press 1 to file a dispute\" nonsense.   \n\nI called back again today, and one of the (many) people I talked to said it can take 3-5 weeks to process a dispute. Thankfully my parents are willing to temporarily loan me some money. I have a new bank now.",

        "text": "One of the strangest things I have ever witnessed at a restaurant took place in Myrtle Beach SC. This happened about 4 years ago on vacation with my wife, then girlfriend. \n\nWe are at one of those huge seafood buffet restaurants, you know the type I'm talking about, tons of all you can eat fried shrimp, crab legs, clam strips, 50 side dishes, and wash it down with a watered down pina coloda. This particular one I have been to a few times before and it's decent for what it is. I don't expect fine dining, just to fill my pie hole with fried stuff and crab legs. \n\nEnter the restaurant, it's crowded but we make our way through the labyrinth of themed rooms and we're seated quickly. BAM we head right to the buffet to get our oyster rockefeller and fried shrimp on, no sweat. We sit back down and start chowing. While I'm eating, I'm glancing around at all the tourists, and taking notes on who has the biggest pile of crab legs on their table. I notice right across from me this family of 4 with huge salads. The mom, kinda plump woman in her 40's with that 1990 hairspray puffy bangs thing going on. The dad, average blue collar looking dude, kinda a harsh mug on him though. Two beansprout boys, about 8-12 years old, looking like tiny Tim at the thanksgiving table waiting to catch a scrap of something if they got lucky. \n\nAnyway, they all had gigantic salads. 4 identical looking salads. Of all things to get at a seafood buffet, a huge salad isn't high on most peoples list at these type of restaurant. Now I have nothing against salads, and I do get them sometimes, maybe a small side salad to start off or perhaps cleanse the pallet in between seafood. No, these were entire dinner plates heaped with salad. They looked like mostly romaine lettuce, cheddar cheese shreds, and ranch dressing. GOBS of ranch dressing. There's probably some other stuff in there but it's obscured by the curtain of ranch. \n\nThat struck me as so strange for some reason, but hey, whatever, I have seafood to devour. I get back to chowing and yapping with my wife. I quickly glance back over to the salad family and see the mom is using a fork and knife to shred a salad.  I can hear the piercing sound of the knife and fork scraping the salad into oblivion. She's actually turning it into a creamy mess. more suitable now as a dip. Back and forth with the knife and fork, she pulpified each one of the family's salads. \n\nOver the duration of about 10-15 minutes, I had made 2 trips to the buffet and my stomach was about 75% capacity, need to slow down and try to put a dent in that giant virgin pina coloda. As I'm sipping, I glance to the Shreddington famility, Mom has finally gotten the salads to the desired level of viscosity. They all seem to eat in unison, devouring the goop in record time. They must have been waiting all day for that meal because the kids seemed ravenous, grunting and slurping it up. I could hear the sound of all their lips smacking with that hellish ranch pudding creation. I really regret looking at them now because my appetite took a big hit there. In fact, I didn't eat much more after that. \n\nWe got the check and left pretty soon after that. None of the Shreddingtons had made another trip to the buffet. Maybe they were done. Maybe they were resting their stomachs for round 2, shredded prime rib! But alas, I will never know if they ate anything else that day besides ranch chowder. \n",

So anyways, my friends and I go to fast food place that is pretty famous world wide. \nBecause it was before 11, or whenever their breakfast menu closes, I asked the woman working the counter if I could have my breakfast burrito made without meat in it and she said yes.\nI was pretty stoked because I loved these breakfast burritos before I went veggie. So anyways, we get our food and I take a big bite out of one of my burritos and lo and behold I look into my burrito, still food in my mouth, and see the meat in it. \nNow, being vegetarian and accidentily eating meat can be pretty traumatizing combined with the fact that eating meat after not eating it in 3 years could mean that I could possibly get seriously sick. Especially if its greasy fast food meat.\nI headed back up to the counter to talk with the woman who served it to me and she flat out denies saying that to me. Eventually the manager comes out and asks what happens and I tell him and he completely backs up his employee saying that they don't sell the burritos without meat in them. He didn't even offer me a refund or anything. \nIn the end I just sat back down while my friends finished eating and luckily didn't end up getting sick. However I don't know if the fact that English was clearly not this woman's first language and thought I meant something else when I asked about the meat or what. But she totally lied about what she said in front of her manager to cover her own ass. ",

There were signs everywhere, and the hours on the shop's window now says till 10 PM Mon- Fri. It's on the school website, too. \n\nI work at the campus library (open till midnight) and had just gotten on shift. My supervisor asked me to go grab her a soda so I ran on over. **It's 8:30 PM.** I get there...the gate is down and they are cleaning up. \n\nNow I did something I feel a little shitty about,  but I asked one of the workers if there was any way I could get a soda real quick (it was the only way to get a soda that late on campus, or I would have just gone somewhere else). She (obviously) said no, so I thanked her, apologized, and left.  \n\nI asked around, and it turns out they almost always close around 8 PM. If you're going to close then, fine, but if you're going to, why advertise that you'll be open 2 hours later? \n\nYou just break the soda-starved hearts of late-working students.",

        "text": "I was looking at buying a new car. I'd looked for months. I compared prices, looked up vehicles on Kelley Blue Book, and looked at twenty different car sites. I found the exact vehicle I wanted for the price. I called the dealership, which is 50 miles away from the town I live in, and talked to a salesman. He told me all about the vehicle but said that it had a salvaged title. \n\nSo on Friday I pack up my daughter and we hit the road to look at this vehicle. I get there and the building is a run down shack with 50 cars parked so close around it that there was barely a walk way for her and I to get to the front door. The nice salesman I talked to on the phone came out to greet us. I had let him know I'd be there to test drive it the day before our visit and called him on our way down to confirm. When we arrived he said it would take him an hour to get the car out to drive since it was completely grid locked by other cars.\n\nAnyway, the three of us tread through knee deep snow to go start the car. We're walking around it and I was listening to how it was running and checking the dash for any warning lights. While I'm in the car an old, physically dirty man walks over but stands about a car away from the salesman, my daughter, and myself. I had asked if they've had any problems while driving or starting it and the owner starts yelling at his salesman to \"come on come on come on\". The salesman brushes off the demands and answers that question of mine. I then ask \" what kind of accident has this vehicle been in where it became a salvaged title?\". The owner loses his mind at this question and yells at me \"you're so stupid. This is fucking bullshit!!!!!!\". My daughter becomes frightened and hides behind my legs because she's not used to any of that behavior. The owner had started walking back to the shack then stops and asks me \" where did you find it was a salvaged title? The internet?!?\" I ignored him, grabbed my daughter, muttered \"wow\", walk/jogged to my car and sped out of that town like a bat out of hell.\n\nIdk what all I could do about this but I hate what happened to me and I hate what it might have done to my daughter. We drove over an hour and used a tank of gas for a 5 minute hell visit.",

        "text": "Hi guys!  I was referred here from /r/TalesFromYourServer. Tonight I had my own awful experience as a diner, which I thought maybe you guys would be interested in.\nMy friend and I were headed to another establishment near this one, where another friend was performing that night with his band. On the way, we realized that we were quite hungry, and quickly checked Yelp for a place with decent food somewhere on this street that primarily consisted of bars. We came across this spot and everyone seemed to advertise it as the \"best burger in town,\" so we gave it a shot. Upon entering, it was clear that this was primarily a bar, so we decided to quickly grab a bite and sit down, wolf down our food, and leave. While waiting for our burgers, we each asked for a glass of water at the bar.\n\nOnce we got our food, we sat at a table to eat quickly and finish our water, before heading to the next place. While we were eating, the cocktail waitress approached our table with a big pitcher of water and refilled our water glasses without us asking, which we greatly appreciated and thanked her for. She asked us if there was anything else that she could get us, and noticing that there was no ketchup on the table to eat with our fries, my buddy asked her if she could get us some. At that point, she gave him a look like he had just shot her puppy, and slammed a bottle of ketchup down on our table and walked off. Weird, we thought, but no big deal. I still planned to give her a nice tip at this point for the water refills, as we expected nothing like that from a cocktail waitress. 2 minutes later, she returns and asks if there's anything else she can get us, and my friend asks politely for another water refill, which this time results in \"Of course I'll get you more water! Sure! That's great!\" in the most ludicrous way, as if someone had said they were going to abuse her cat or something.\n\nShe comes back with a pitcher of water, and fills my glass, while leaving my friend's empty, which is the most unprofessional thing I've ever seen a server do in all my years of dining out. \"By the way,\" she says very rudely, \"I'm a cocktail waitress, I serve liquor drinks,\" before leaving his glass empty and walking away. We were both stunned and didn't even know what to do, so at the time we just sat there in awe, although we probably should have asked for a manager at this point.\n\nFinally, when my buddy goes to close our tab up, she comes up to me and again asks \"What liquor drinks can I get you?\" I say \"I'm okay, thank you.\" She responds with \"Oh, I see how it is, you come in here and order food from the kitchen and drink two waters! That's just great!\" I have no idea why she was being so rude to us, but little did she know, I've recently completed a year sober in the Alcoholics Anonymous program. Although I am young, so I don't look like a \"stereotypical\" alcoholic, I have struggled with sobriety since the day I started drinking, and am proud to have completed a year without a drink, but pressure from people like her makes it that much harder. My buddy doesn't drink when out with me in order to help me with the program, so that's why we ordered the waters. Again, she didn't know this, but her rudeness was enough to ensure I'll never be visiting this establishment again. I'm more than happy finding the nearest Five Guys next time, where I can enjoy my burger and fries without being shamed for a disease that I have.\n\nThis was the first time in my life that I've walked without leaving a tip, although I did drop a couple bucks off with the bartender because he was nothing but nice, and I hope that not a cent of it went to this bitch.\n\nTL;DR- Please don't be rude to non-drinkers. You never know our stories or what's going on to us. Props to those of you out there who are great cocktail waiters/waitresses, and to anyone reading this, please tip well for those that deserve it!",

Let's skip right to the action.\n\nIt is Tuesday, halfway done with our vacation, and we go to this local Mexican restaurant with our friend because we haven't been there yet.  We go inside, sit down, and we order nachos and my girlfriend orders a margarita, on special for $0.99 woohoo.  Nachos and first margarita come and I look and think, \"I've never tried a margarita before and it's only $1, i'll try one too.\"  So I order a margarita along with our entree order.\n\nEntrees come by and we're eating just fine, our friend points at me and says, \"You didn't get your margarita.\"  Oh yea, I didn't, and I didn't even notice.  She says, \"I'll go up there and tell them since you're sitting on the inside.\"  So she gets up, tells them that I haven't received mine, and comes back. It was only $1 so it wouldn't have bothered me if I didn't get it but whatever.\n\nSo our server comes back with TWO margaritas, interesting.  I start drinking one and we all finish our meals and get the tab.  Wow, this is lame, we were charged for four(4) margaritas.  Now remember, they're each at $0.99 so I'm not too bummed, whoopie $2, i'm not going to make a deal out of it.  My girlfriend on the other hand, is really upset.\n\nShe goes up to the front and tells them the situation, she ordered one, I ordered one that never came, and when our friend reminded them they brought us two more and charged us for four.  She comes back and they only took one off of the bill, the one we never received.  I give her money to pay the bill and go to the bathroom.\n\nGot done in the bathroom, went to the car and the first thing my girlfriend tells me is, \"She called me a bitch.\"\n\n\"What?! Seriously?\", I reply\n\n\"Yea, and I almost made a scene.  When I was walking out she whispered to herself, \"bitch\" and I turned around and said \"WOW\" very loudly, people looked at me.\"\n\n\"Let's go back in,\" I reply. \"I'll talk to a manager.\"\n\n\"It's not worth it, let's just go.\"\n\nNeedless to say, we're not going back to that place.",

Not long after I placed my order, the local establishment called to let me know that they were short staffed today, and that it'd be a longer wait than usual.

Dude apologizes for the wait and for taking so long, and asks if I'd still like my pizza. Sure. I had a sizeable breakfast and a small snack around lunch time. I'm starting to get a little hungry again. Manager says they comped the pizza - error on their part combined with the wait. I'm a bit skeptical and still assume I'll have to pay for the pizza but for now I say sure. What's the harm?\n\nDelivery guy dropped off my pizza just recently. That is some great customer service. I'm floored. Free pizza tastes great. \n\nI know it's not much, but I slipped the driver a 10 and tried to be clever saying something about needing a refuel. These folks work hard for their money. I've never had to rely on tips to make up the rest of minimum wage, but I've had family and friends work as servers and delivery drivers. So please. Don't forget, or decide not to tip your servers and delivery drivers. If they're flippant and do a shit job, that's one thing. But remember. They're people just like us.",

        "text": "So, this little bit of WTF happened today. First time posting, so yeah; be gentle.\n\nI went with my fiance to one of the local gas stations in town, which happens to be the closest one to where we live ( note; this is somewhat important. ) Its the one we frequent most often, and being smokers, we go there almost daily. Most of the employees there know us, and all is rainbows and sunshine. \n\nEnter their new employee, who I will refer to as \"NM\" or \"New Meat\". NM is already on most of her coworkers' shitlists, but so far this hadnt effected me or my fiance personally. \n\nUntil today.\n\nToday, i go in and buy two drinks and ten bucks worth of gas. While I do this, my fiance uses the restroom. NM rings me up, but only charges me for five bucks worth of gas. I ask for my receipt ( im bad at math, so didnt catch it on the screen at first, ) and inform her of the mistake. Now I work in the food industry, myself, so I know how to be super polite, and I know that goof-ups happen, no big deal, and this was my general attitude. I asked if she could just add five more or void it and replace with ten, or if she'd rather I just go pump the five, then come and buy my other five. Whatever worked best for her. \n\nFull system shutdown. She looks at me like i just grew horns and turned lime green. Another employee -- lets call her Savior -- runs over to tell NM how to fix it but she just doesnt get it. And this is what follows; \n\nNM; \" Well how about you gimme your five dollars and ill ring it up once you pumped the first five.\" \n\nObviously im not comfortable with this, and my fiance -- having just returned from the restroom -- voiced this by insisting that we will just go pump the five, and come buy the rest afterwards. \n\nNM; \"But gimme your five dollars first.\" (She started sounding really desperate at this point. I started getting freaked out a bit.) \n\nMe; \"Its no big deal, this is simpler; we are just topping it off anyway, might not need all ten\"\n\nNM; \"Just gimme your five, though, I can take care of it.\"\n\nMe; \"No really, we will be fine.\"\n\nKeep in mind; she's not just being desperately insistant -- she's actually reaching over the counter at the five dollar bill in my hand, so much so that I actually back up a couple steps out of her reach. I even thought she was implying I hadnt payed for the first five bucks yet, the way she was getting so demanding, so I even showed her my receipt and told her Ill be fine with the five I already payed for. No use  she kept grabbing at me, even as we were trying to get out the door, she was getting louder (and there was another customer in her line, watching her meltdown ).\n\nFinally, my fiance picks up on the fact that i feel wildly uncomfortable with this chick, and finally speaks up;\n\nFiance; ( to me ) \"Give Savior ( other employee ) the five, cus I dont know NM enough.\" \n\nNM giggles awkwardly as if she found our lack of trust in her funny, and we leave. \n\nBut thats not all, folks. \n\nWe returned later that evening for smokes, knowing NM wouldnt still be there. We find out from Savior that once we left, NM ran to the manager in the back, and said my fiance got verbally abusive with her, screaming at her and the like ( but didnt mention me at all, to my knowledge. Wierd. ) Savior tried to defend us to the manager, but the assistant manager--who wasnt even there at the time--claimed that my fiance is banned from the store when New Meat is working. Great. \n\nSorry for my formatting, I'm on a mobile device. Tread lightly through all dat crazy!\n\nEdit; the title is due to her habit of over exaggerating these things, lime how she claimed my fiance was verbally abusive. From the other coworkers that we know better, we know that she does this alot; some small thing turns into an apocolyptic event, when she tells it. \n",

Who would ask for an other sort of \"service\" for money. How she doesn't really mind them touching her ... She continues on to the topic of clients who are dealing with child  protective services and the things she has seen while doing massages at their places. Things I won't repeat, things that shoked me quite a bit. And all this during a \"relaxing\" massage.\n\nThis is where it gets really weird. She starts to talk about her spirituality and how higly intuitive she is. How she can always sence what others are thinking and feeling  (I immediately start screaming SHUT UP! in my head. Doesn't work, weirdly enough...) She tells in great detail about her supernatural encounters with spirits. She tells how she has \"seen\" a client of hers has cancer while giving a massage AND TOLD THAT TO HIM/HER! (no mentioning of an actual diagnosis) She tells me how she gets really nauseous from olives and would smell smoke while eating them. Later she had discovered that she used to be a witch in one of her previous lives and was burned alive  in an olive grove and that why she can't stand olives.\n\nI'm really, REALLY hoping the two hours are soon over.  No such luck, she rambles on to her sexlife  (again in great detail) FINALLY she says the sweetest words I ever heard from her; We are done! She suggests we book our next apointment right away, I mumble something about not having my calendar with me, get dressed real quick (with her, Jesus and Indian deity watcing) and almost  run out of there! Feeling extremely violated the rest of the day and having chills down my spine every time I remember my massage from a witch.",

        "text": "I was a bad driver when I was a teen.  Accidents, traffic violations, the works.  My state had a minimum car insurance requirement.  My car should have been $400/year, instead I was paying $2000/year because of all the points against me.\n\nYou can imagine how happy I was to get a letter from the state saying they were completely revamping the points system and anyone who had no violations in a three year period would have their points set back to zero.  I'd been a good boy for the last three years so great news!\n\nThen I got my next years bill and it was still for two grand.  No problem, I'll just stop by the office and clear up the mistake.\n\nNice woman explains to me that they go by the court date for violations, not the ticket issue date, so I am one week shy of the required three year grace period.  Doesn't seem like a big problem, $1600 pro-rated over one week is less than fifty bucks so we should be good.  That's when she brings her manager over.\n\nHe makes it clear that he expects me to pay the entire two grand for the year and then NEXT year I can pay the reduced $400 rate.  He is firm about this so I ask him to cancel the policy and I will take my business elsewhere.  Hell, I'll leave the car in my driveway for a week and then get insurance if that's what it takes to save $1600 bucks!\n\nThat's when it gets weird.  Manager insists that I have to turn in my plates at the DMV and come back with the slip showing I had turned in my plates or he will not cancel the policy.  Having been such a bad driver I had been to several insurance companies over the years and still had my original plates so I know turning in plates is not a requirement to change insurance companies.\n\nLong story short we get into a major shouting match.  Spittle flying out of control type thing with me screaming at him to cancel my damn policy and him screaming at me that he won't cancel the policy unless I turn my plates in to the DMV.\n\nThen I have an epiphany and stop yelling.  I'm not only calm, I'm smiling.  Eventually the manager runs out of steam long enough to realize he is the only one still screaming...\n\nMGR:  WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?\n\nMe:  You're going to cancel my policy.\n\nMGR:  I TOLD YOU I'M NOT CANCELING YOUR POLICY UNLESS YOU TURN IN YOUR PLATES!\n\nMe:  (holds up bill)  See this bill?  I'm not going to pay it.  In a few weeks I'm going to get another bill on yellow paper stating \"second notice\" and you know what?  I'm not going to pay that one either.  A few weeks after that I'll get a third bill.  That one will be on red paper and will say final notice.  That one will have a date on it and will say that if I don't pay by that date my policy will be cancelled.  You know what?  I'm not going to pay that one either. So...one way or another you ARE going to cancel my policy.\n\nHe then proceeded to cancel my policy.  Took less than five minutes.",

They also have a small fridge that they stock with some salads and sandwiches for people to buy after the sandwich counter is closed.\n\nI go in there one day about 1PM and ask the woman behind the counter for a salad with tuna (basically a garden salad with a scoop of tuna fish plopped onto it).\n\nWoman:  Salads are in the fridge.\n\nMe: OK! Great. \n\nMe: (After looking in fridge)  Uhm, there's no tuna salads in the fridge?\n\nWoman:  All the salads we have are in the fridge.\n\nMe:  Oh!

I'm not a violent person and by the time I left, without a tuna salad, I was ready to cause major physical damage to some thing or some one.\n\nThis happened a few years back.

Someone suggested I make it a post here so here it is.\n\nGot a hot tub and during the first winter when I could not replace the water due to the weather I was having a hard time keeping the PH and alkalinity down.\n\nI brought a sample of water to a local pool/hot tub place and they put a small amount of something in the thermos that I had used to bring the water in. Told me to be very careful, dump this into the hot tub as soon as I get home, don't breath in any fumes (hold it away while pouring) and don't get any on your skin.\n\nAbout halfway back to my house the thermos exploded and the car filled with toxic gas. I pulled over and my wife and I bailed (her apparently screaming at me to pull over and me screaming at her to close her eyes and not breathe).\n\nTurns out they had given us muriatic acid (dilute hydrochloric acid) that had reacted to the thermos liner causing the explosion. All in all we were there for about three hours, the police closed the road. I had to throw out my jacket because it had been splattered with acid. The car was totaled. The pool stores insurance wound up paying for everything (apparently they really, really were not supposed to give us this stuff in some random container). The paramedics told us we were very lucky that neither of us breathed in any of the gas (one of the reasons we were there for hours was the acid gas kept pouring out of the car).\n\nI'll never forget the first cop who responded to the scene...\n\nCop: So...can you tell me what happened here?\n\nMe: Sputters out entire story starting with the hot tub and ending with the explosion.\n\nCop: I am SO glad you actually had a reasonable explanation. When I first got the call I was sure I was going to find a couple of meth heads transporting chemicals.\n",

Like, sometimes they'll put a chili or a flame next to items that are spicy, or a leaf or something next to vegetarian items?\n\nA while ago my cousins and I went to an all you can eat Japanese restaurant. I also invited a friend of mine. My friend happens to be vegetarian. My friend was going to arrive a little later than we did.\n\nBeing the friend that I am, I decided that I should order some vegetarian items in advance. On the menu there are a bunch of items that had a small broccoli symbol next to it (and on the bottom, the menu indicated that the broccoli symbol means vegetarian).\n\nI ordered a few items. My friend arrived. Sat down. I told him I got a few items for him. Of note was the grilled eggplant and grilled mushroom.\n\n&gt; Cousin: \"Uhh... There's fish on that dish.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"What?\"\n\n&gt; Cousin: \"Yeah, I'm like, 90% sure those are fish flakes at the top.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Those aren't onion flakes?\"\n\n&gt; Cousin: \"No. I'm pretty sure they're bonito flakes. They're made of fish.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"... But the menu said it's vegetarian...\"\n\n&gt; Cousin: \"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure that's made of fish.\"\n\nOkay. I thought they were onion flakes, but then again I'm not that great with food. So we call the waitress over.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Hi, just wondering. What are those flakes made of?\"\n\n&gt; Waitress: \"Fish.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"... The menu said it's marked as vegetarian.\"\n\n&gt; Waitress: \"Are you vegetarian?\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"No, but my friend who just arrived is.\"\n\n&gt; Waitress: \"Oh, I'm so sorry. Hold on a minute.\"\n\nThey took back the dishes and left for a bit.\nI had to do a double take. I looked at the menu again. Those items have the broccoli symbol. On the bottom it said the broccoli symbol means it's a vegetarian item...\n\nEventually the waitress brings back the food sans fish flakes on it.\n\n&gt; Waitress: \"Sorry for what happened. Next time you visit, please let us know in advance if you have a vegetarian with you so we can make sure their food won't have meat in it.\"\n\n... In other words, we had to let the restaurant know in advance that they should make the items that are marked as vegetarian vegetarian. \n\nThis was only with those particular menu items too (the grilled eggplant and mushroom). All the other items marked vegetarian are clearly vegetarian... ",

During the planning process we made several trips up to Hometown, but since it was such a long trek we did as much as we could from home and only went up there to arrange the photographer, flowers, church, and reception. \n\nThe week of the wedding, I drove up to Hometown a couple days before my husband so I could finish getting things together. One of the last tasks I had was to pick up the marriage license from the courthouse. I checked their website to see what I needed to do to get the license, and as far as I could tell I just needed to go down to the courthouse, pay a fee, and I would receive it that day.*\n\nThe wedding was on Saturday. On Thursday, my MIL and I went to the courthouse and I requested the marriage certificate, only to be told, whoops, there was actually a three-day waiting period before I would be able to get it. \n\nOh. Fuck.\n\nI started to panic. Here I'd been planning this wedding for over a year, carefully making sure that my natural tendency toward procrastination wouldn't screw me over, and now two days before the big event it looked like everything was going to blow up in my face. \n\nOne of the women behind the desk asked me if I had the wedding all planned out. On the verge of tears, I said yes, and she screwed up her face and snapped, \"Well what did you wait so long for, then?!\"\n\nShe then went on to say that they could waive the waiting period for a $10 fee, but that because my husband was the resident of Hometown County, he would either have to be present or I would need his driver's license. And of course, he was on the highway at the time and wouldn't be in town until after 5:00, when the courthouse closed. I asked the woman if he could come in tomorrow to pick it up, and she responded with, \"Well we close at one on Fridays and there's a lot of paperwork to do, he can't just come in at the last minute!\"\n\nWe left with me in tears, and my MIL completely aghast at how nasty this lady had been to me. \n\nTo top it off, when my husband went in the next morning to pick up the license, they asked why he hadn't gotten it earlier. He told them, \"My fiancee went in to get it yesterday and you wouldn't give it to her\" and they gave him the license *without* the extra fee, no problem. \n\n* Key phrase being \"as far as I could tell.\" It's entirely possible I misread the website or missed where it mentioned the waiting period. It's equally possible the website was incorrect. ",

My mom and I upgraded our family plan to the mobile share plan (or whatever its called) and ordered an iPhone 6 plus, which I will be using (she'll be using my old iPhone 5). Because we would need to move her sim card into my old phone, and it would need to be cut to fit, we had the phone shipped to the store, rather than our house.\n\nToday the [non postal service shipping service] tracker said it had shipped, so I called the store to see when we could pick it up, and no one responded. Finding that odd, my mom and I drove over there to find the store under construction. The entire interior was gone, and the only people there were construction workers, who told us the store would be under construction until probably next Monday.\n\nWhen we got home, I called [cellphone service company] about this, wondering if the phone had in fact been delivered and they were unable to tell me, and to check with [shipping service]. So I called [shipping service] whose automatic voice system told me it had been delivered and signed for at about 1 pm. I called back to [cellphone service company]'s customer service line, and the woman who \"helped\" me was very unhelpful. I told her several times about the store being under construction, and the fact that there were no actual [cellphone service company] workers there. She didn't seem to understand for a long time and eventually told me to go back to the store and ask about the person who signed for the package and that she \"would call me back after looking for more information\" or something close to that.  (I still haven't received a call.)\n\nI went back to the store, and the construction worker, most were gone for the day as it was approximately 5 pm, confirmed that the package (and apparently 2 others since he said there were 3 boxes) had been delivered and signed for, and they had put them in the back room of the building (an area unaccessible to customers before construction began). There seems to be little I can do until the construction ends, but it really ticks me off that I have to wait so long for something that I was wholly unaware of. When making the purchase, the associate said nothing about the upcoming construction.\n\nI have made an appointment at the local company store in the next town over to see if there is anything they can do. Do you guys have any suggestions? I've run out of places to look for advice.",

He's being helped by a new girl, she just started about two weeks ago and still learning the ropes. \n\nThe guy is getting more and more irritated, she's fumbling a bit, clearly nervous, and the more nervous she gets the more mistakes she makes and the more agitated the guy is getting:\n\n&gt;I want *lettuce* on it, not *spinach*. No not *that* much! God! Now tomatoes!

Don't they train you to do this shit!?\n\nThe girl finally just couldn't do it anymore, she put everything down and just walked into the back with that \"if anyone talks to me I might spontaneously combust\" faces.\n\nDudebro is livid and starts pounding on the glass to get attention. A few seconds later, one of the other employees comes out. I recognized her, a Latina woman who, despite being very sweet, wore a constant stern and very serious expression.\n\nShe doesn't say a word but picks up where the girl left off and finally goes to cut the sandwich to which the guy starts rattling off this long list of how he wants it cut and bagged and the service is so slow and how Jaws wasn't that great of a movie (I don't fucking know, I'd tuned him out by that point).\n\nThe woman picks up the knife and goes to cut the sandwich before being hit with this list of demands. Without a word she stands up straight, looks him straight in the eye, set her jaw, and gives him the [death stare](http://wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/obama1.png). It was a very clear \"you are finished talking now, do not test me\" look. No words, just a death stare that dropped the temperature of the room several degrees.\n\nHe tried to sputter on but she was fucking relentless. He just sort of trailed off into this awkward silence and when he stopped she cut his sandwich, bagged it up, handed it to him, took his money, and watched him go.\n\nI asked the woman to give her coworker a hug from me.

They live in a pretty rural area, and it was between 6 and 9 pm, so it wasn't super busy or anything. There were a total of 6 people in our party.\n\nBizarre incident #1 came when my husband ordered an egg cream. If you don't know, an egg cream does not have eggs or cream, and consists of milk, soda water, and chocolate (usually, but it can be any flavor) syrup.\n\nThe waitress, a middle-aged lady, returned with the egg cream that was white in color. Joe took a sip and made a face, because it was just milk and soda water, sans syrup. When the waitress returned Joe questioned her, pointing out that an egg cream has syrup. She replied that he should have asked for syrup.\n\nBizarre incident #2: About halfway into the meal, the waitress returned and asked if I'd like a refill on my lemonade. When I said yes, she poured soda water in the glass.\n\nFinally, and this one may just have been an honest mistake, I ordered a grilled vegetable panini. (Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of options as a vegetarian in diners.)\n\nThe ingredients were bread, grilled vegetables, and mozzarella cheese. But when I bit into the first half of the sandwich, I tasted a chunk of chicken. Again, maybe the kitchen just fucked up, but this sort of thing is borderline traumatic when you're a vegetarian for ethical purposes. And that wraps up bizarre incident #3.\n\nThis isn't a terribly exciting story, more of a pedestrian example of a dining establishment that, at least on that day, just totally didn't give a fuck.

Turned out that my phone was corrupt, but that's beside the point. This meant that I always kept my warranty details handy. Cue my charger breaking, and me going into the store to get a replacement in the middle of the night (it was a gas station). I walk up to the front desk and ask for a new one, and he mentions that warranties can only be addressed during the day. I'm fine with that and buy a new one (that looked very similar to my phone cord). He rings me up silently and while I wait for my coffee to be made I realise I'd gotten the wrong cord. I see if I can return it as it was still in the original packaging and he says \"I told you that all sales are final.\" He did not, and when I argued it more he said \"I'm sorry, but I mentioned that all sales are final 5 minutes ago.\" After a few minutes I get pissed and say \"I get that it's your policy, but you can't lie to me and say that you warned me because you absolutely did not.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Event 2:**\nI walk up to a store, wait in line like a good little girl.

I despise when employees make a mistake and refuse to admit it, instead lying to my face. This happens quite often but two memories really stick out to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Event 1**\nI have terrible luck with phone chargers, I once went through 10 in a single month. Turned out that my phone was corrupt, but that's beside the point. This meant that I always kept my warranty details handy. Cue my charger breaking, and me going into the store to get a replacement in the middle of the night (it was a gas station). I walk up to the front desk and ask for a new one, and he mentions that warranties can only be addressed during the day. I'm fine with that and buy a new one (that looked very similar to my phone cord). He rings me up silently and while I wait for my coffee to be made I realise I'd gotten the wrong cord. I see if I can return it as it was still in the original packaging and he says \"I told you that all sales are final.\" He did not, and when I argued it more he said \"I'm sorry, but I mentioned that all sales are final 5 minutes ago.\" After a few minutes I get pissed and say \"I get that it's your policy, but you can't lie to me and say that you warned me because you absolutely did not.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Even 2**\nI walk up to a store, wait in line like a good little girl.

        "text": "(See Part I for the first half of my travel adventure)\n\nThe airline has hired someone to drive us to Denver in a van, where we can catch connecting flights to our subsequent\ndestinations. Like I said before, my broken spirit didn't care anymore. Just point me to the van, and I'll go wherever it takes me.\n\n\nAfter an hour or so of waiting, the van arrives. Okay, first off, I'm fairly certain this wasn't a transportation company.\nMuch like my \"shuttle\" to the hotel a few days ago, this is just some guy with a white van.\n\n\nBut hey, I don't care anymore, so sure, let's go. Me and bunch of young quiet cowboy type guys hop into the van. They let\nme go in first (ladies first), which I found kinda sweet.\n\n\nI move to the back, and end up next to the broken window. It's just newspaper and duct tape. But hey, you know what, I have a seat-belt and a ride to Denver, so let's go, I'm ready!\n\n\n**??: \"Hey schweety, scoot over a bit.\"**\n\n\nA large middle-aged man sits next to me, red-faced, and obviously drunk as a skunk. Uh... nope, don't care. He's drunk, that's okay, no worries, let's go. The driver gets in, and tells us to buckle-up. No problem there. And we start our trek south to Denver.\n\n\nWe hop on the highway, and cold freezing air is blowing in through the newspaper window. Luckily I've already numbed to the\nfact that I'm on a life roller-coaster that I can't get off of. So what's a little frostbite.\n\n\nThe internal laughter grows louder, as I start daring god or whoever is in charge here, to bring it on! I can take it!\n\n\nDrunk guy starts talking to me, asking where I'm from and what I do. So I figure I should just talk to him. I tell him I'm from\nthe bay area, and work in computers. He gives his life story about his wife, and his sales job that has him traveling a lot. Then it\ntakes a strange turn.\n\n\n\n**DrunkGuy: \"Are you from San Francisco?\"**\n\n**Me: \"No, just outside of there.\"**\n\n**DrunkGuy: \"There's a lot of gays there. (Loudly) You aren't one of those gays are you?!\"**\n\n**Me: (I am. Fuck, what do I say?). \"Um. Nope?\"**\n\n**DrunkGuy: \"Cool, same as me!\"**\n\n**DrunkGuy: \"Yay for straight!\"** \n\n\nAnd he literally holds up his hand to be high-fived. No joke. So what could I do, but give him the most awkward, eyebrow-raising, high-five I ever have, or ever will give someone.\n\n\n***CLAP!* \"Alright!\"**\n\n\nSuddenly, while on the highway, the van lurches and starts emitting a very disappointing sound.\n\n\n**Driver: \"Uh oh. This isn't good.\"**\n\n\nThe van starts slowing down, until the driver is forced to pull over as the engine dies altogether. Keep in mind that we all have connecting\nflights in Denver today. Flights that we may not make now. But at this point, I'm no longer surprised. I'm just along for the ride.\n\n\nI stay put and nod, while the drunk guy regales me with more life stories, blowing his whiskey breath in my general direction.\nAnd now with the van heater off, the cold is becoming unbearable.\nI miss Janeway.\n\n\nThe driver was able to radio-in a policeman for help, who showed up with some supplies, including gas. And wouldn't you know it.\nGas. We were **fucking out of gas**. The idiot driver didn't fill up the tank before we left, and left us stranded on the side of the highway,\nwith no gas. Luckily though, with some now in our tank, we were on our way again. Me, drunk guy, idiot driver, and a van full of angry cold passengers.\n\n\nWe had to stop once more for gas, just in case. But the van was such a piece of shit...\n\n\n**Driver: \"I can't turn the engine off, because it may not turn back on again. Heh heh.\"**\n\n\nThe risk of explosion while filling an idling van's gas tank is probably low, but I wasn't sure at the time. So I just sat there, and contemplated which outcome would be worse right now. But we didn't blow up, so we kept going.\n\n\n**DrunkGuy: \"Hey baby, say cheese.\"**\n\n\nAt some point, DG decides to start taking photos of me. And I am in NO mood to smile, let alone have some creepy\ndrunk guy take photos of me. I give a weak smile, as if to say, \"I'm not amused\". But he keeps pressing me, and eventually I stop humoring him.\n\n\n**DrunkGuy: (Very loud. Very angry.) \"I SAID SMILE!\"**\n\n\nOookay, now I'm getting worried. I look around for one of the other guys to say something... but silence. \n\nFuck this. I turn my head and look out the newspaper window. He starts muttering about me being a bitch. I hate flying.\n\n\nWe make it to Denver, but there isn't much time. I grab my bags, and want to kiss the terminal ground. I run into the airport and\ncheck the flights. My flight has been delayed 1 hour, but that's okay! It means I don't need to rush. \n\n\nThe airport is full of people who have spent nights there, and the place is a mess. I consider myself lucky to even have a flight out.\nI get to my terminal, and try not to get too excited just yet. \nBut there it is. The plane that's going to take me to Oakland arrives. From here on out, everything happens as expected.\n\n\nWe takeoff, I arrive in Oakland, where my parents are expecting me. I end up at their house the evening of Christmas Eve, just in time\nfor Christmas.\n\n\nThe airline called me a few months later, to send me a flight voucher for anywhere in the U.S. But wouldn't reimburse my dad for hotel or anything, \nsince I didn't have any receipts. I didn't think to keep them at the time unfortunately.\n\n\nI doubt I'll ever want to go back to Cheyenne, and I try to avoid the Denver airport in the winter months.\n\n\nAnd to this day I'm still a huge Star Trek Voyager fan, so I have that going for me. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "The year was 2006, I was a young fresh faced gal of 26, and had been spending the last several years going to college in *middle-of-nowhere* Iowa. I just landed my first professional job, and the holidays are fast approaching. I'm excited to be flying back to California for Christmas, to visit family for a week.\n\nI drive to the small Iowa airport, to start my journey west. I only have one stop in Denver, before arriving in Oakland, California. Just one stop, 2 hours at the longest, this should be a fairly quick trip.\nWe take off in some medium-sized plane, and it's totally full. Probably a lot of Iowans, and people who hopped over from Minneapolis and maybe Chicago.\n\nI'm somewhat scared of flying, but I make it work. As we get closer to Colorado, the pilot (Cpt) gets on the speaker. \n\n**Cpt: \"Hi folks. We're getting word from Denver that visibility is down, and wind and snow aren't letting up. Just letting you know there's a chance we might have to turn around and go back.\"**\n\nThe whole cabin groans, with some quiet cursing and murmuring going around.\n\n**Cpt: \"We'll keep you posted.\"**\n\nNow I'm a little upset. I haven't seen my family in four years, and I was lucky to get time off despite not being at my new job for very long. And now I'm probably going to end up right back in snowy Iowa, spending Christmas alone.\nSomehow the thought of spending Christmas alone was worse than the thought of being inside a metal device, being flown through snow and ice, in no visibility conditions. And I was pretty sure most of the plane felt the same way. \n\nIt's dark outside, and I can't really see anything. The *ding* of the speaker chimes again.\n\n**Cpt: \"Well, a decision has been made. We're continuing to Denver.\"**\n\nThe plane perks up. As I suspected, most everybody wants to push on.\nAs we continue, we haven't yet started to descend. But we start turning, as if we should be. Going in circles... over and over and over and over. What the hell. The pilot comes back on.\n\n**Cpt: \"We can't land in Denver. The conditions have gotten worst and the runways are closed. Aaaand we don't have enough fuel to fly black to Iowa.\"**\n\nwell, shit.\n\n**Cpt: \"So, we're flying north a ways, to land in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It's not too far from here. We are going to wait there until the Denver runways open up, then fly you there.\"**\n\nOh no. So, I'm missing my Oakland flight. And I don't have enough money for a hotel if it comes to that. Keep in mind I've just recently been a poor college student. I might have been 26, but I was still fairly new at being an *adult*, and experiencing all the \"crazy\" situations you might find yourself in.\nThe captain turns the plane around and we start heading north, descending on the way. As we dip lower, we finally experience what's really going on out there. I see nothing but white flurries flying past the window. Thick snow is everywhere, and the plane is getting pushed around in all directions. \n~~Please dear god.~~\n\nThe radio squelch returns. What now?!\n\n**Cpt: \"So, this plane is actually a little large for this airport, so we will be landing a little differently than usual. Just a heads up.\"**\n\nToo big?! How small is this airport exactly? We just took off from the middle of Iowa! And what does he mean 'differently'? Like backwards? Magic?\n\nI can see the ground now, and we are absolutely in the middle of a blizzard. And we are coming up on one of the two runways. This is it. Here comes the touchdown.\nWe descend very quick and hit the runway, while the engines and brakes fire. I can't possibly be gripping my chair any harder, as I imagine\nevery possible thing that could go wrong right now. And we stop, still on the runway, all in one piece.\nThe whole plane cheers and claps for the pilot. We made it! Now we wait.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n..and wait, and wait, still on the plane. No word about Denver or what the plan is. I'm starting to think, there isn't one.\nFinally we get word that Denver is shut down, and we need to de-plane. Everyone grabs their things, and exits the plane. Since this is a small airport, you have to cross the runway outside, and then into the airport. So we all exit the plane and into the blizzard, crossing the runway in 5 degree, 40mph snowy weather.\n\nOnce inside the airport, it's not much better. The place is deserted. In fact, the entire town of Cheyenne is on lock-down. Nothing is open, and the blizzard and snow has blown open and broken the front doors. The airport itself is freezing. Snow is blowing in, and the flight crew are trying to calm a plane of exhausted, angry passengers.  They take names and phone numbers of passengers, and tell us they will call when the plane plans on taking off tomorrow. That's the plan.\n\nMeanwhile passengers are trying to reach local hotels to grab rooms before they are all snatched up. Others are trying to reserve new flights, and whatever other transportation they can find.\nI however, have no idea what to do. In a moment of panic, I ask a woman standing next to me what we should do, and she gave me the nastiest look. Like she couldn't believe I would talk to her. Okay, I was on my own, but I needed some help.\nSo I head out through the broken doors, to try and get a signal on my cellphone. And I manage to get a hold of my dad. I quickly tell him how I'm stuck in Cheyenne, and I think I need to get a hotel before all of these people snatch them up. Like I said, the airport is empty. The flight crew doesn't have vouchers and can't provide any help. I can't even spend the night in the airport because there's no heat, and snow is blowing in.\n\nMy Dad is on it. He tells me he'll find a room and call me back with the details. Sure enough he reserves a room for me, and lets me know where.\nBut then we hear that because of the blizzard, the hotel shuttles refuse to go out. And I don't blame them. No taxis, no rentals, no buses, nothing. But the flight crew was on it. Somehow they got the word out, and local Cheyennians start showing up. Anyone who owned a large 4x4 with chains was\noutside the airport, like some kind of post-apocalyptic road crew ready for action. \nThey group people by hotel and send them out with these amazing strangers.\nI get grouped with another young man, and we hop into some kind of custom supped-up 2-door pickup truck. It had the largest wheels I'd ever seen. I actually felt comfortable, if anything could get us through a blizzard, this could. It's owner was an older guy with a big overgrown beard, suspenders, cheesy grin, who looked like he was having WAY too much fun. We squeeze into the cab next to him, and Bushybeard takes off. \n\n**BB: \"Where ya going!?\"**\n\nWe tell him the hotel and he says he knows just where that is. He's driving like this snow is nothing. He starts pointing out the windows, giving us a tour of the city, as he loudly proclaims everything we're passing. Except we can't see anything but snow. I just want him to watch the road. \nThis was the first of many times I just had to laugh. I might actually survive the emergency landing, but die in this monster truck on the way to the hotel. But what could I do? Get out?\nSo I trusted he would get us there, and sure enough he comes to a halt.\n\n**BB: \"Here ya go! Good luck and stay warm! Ha!\"**\n\nWe thank him, grab our things, and push through the blizzard towards the doors of the hotel. Oh but wait. Me and the other guy both stop and look at the front doors where the hotel name is proudly displayed.   And it's not our hotel.\n\n**Me: \"shit.\"**\n\n**Guy: \"yeah.\"**\n\n**Me: \"Now what? Go in I guess.\"**\n\n**Guy: \"I guess.\"**\n\n\nSo we go to the front desk. \n\n\n**Me: \"Uh, where is [other hotel]? We got dropped off incorrectly.\"**\n\n**Front desk: \"Oh that's just down the road.\"**\n\n**Guy: \"How far exactly?\"**\n\n**Front desk: \"Not far, you can see it from here. Well, when it's not snowing.. haha.\"**\n\nGuy and I look at each other, like, is this really happening?\n\n**Guy: \"Okay, thanks.\"**\n\nWe pick up our carry-ons, and head back outside. It was hard leaving the warm lobby.\nWe look down the road, but we can't read any signs, there is just too much snow and wind. So we just\nrun for it. It was down-hill for part of the way, so we were moving at a good clip. We have no idea where we are going, \nor when we are going to get there. I'm just trying not to lose my balance against the wind, while peering through the slits in my eyes as snow sticks to my face.\n\nFinally we come to a building that's obviously a hotel, and we hope like hell it's the right one.\nAnd it is, we made it!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI say my goodbyes to the other guy, as we check-in. Everything is in order, thank the gods. \nThe front desk lets me know that restaurants aren't open now, because of the storm, but there is a pizza place\nthat is willing to deliver here. And the hotel serves breakfast every morning.\nSo I go up to my room, order a pizza, call my family and let them know I made it to the hotel, and try\nto relax for the first time today. And god I wished I had a beer.\n\nBefore finally going to sleep, I realize I have no idea how I'm going to get out of this town. The flight crew took\nmy phone number, but assuming they DO call me, how am I going to make it back to the airport? And when can I expect\nflights to be available again? \n\nOkay, here's the deal... For the next THREE days, I fed on pizza, vendor machine treats, and hotel breakfasts. Every day I would call the airport reservation line multiple times, and try to get an agent, and get an update on the situation. The update was usually a lot of \"I don't know\", \"we'll let you know\", and \"nothing new\", IF I was lucky enough to get someone on the phone.\n\nI was stuck in my room, since the blizzard outside was still horrible and the town on lock-down. Every day I was stuck there, my anxiety was increasingly getting higher and higher. And the only thing that provided any relief, was the television. Specifically, the marathon of Star Trek Voyager on Spike TV. For all three days, Spike TV was broadcasting in my room. I was watching Captain Janeway and her crew stranded in the Delta Quadrant, hoping and\nfighting to get home. And even though my situation wasn't nearly as grim, I felt a connection. And since this was Spike TV, every episode featured Seven of Nine. **EVERY** one.\n\nI can safely say that my landing in Cheyenne that Christmas of 2006 is what truly brought home my love of Star Trek.\nEventually, I received a call from the airlines. They told me the weather was clearing up, and a flight was going to land\ntomorrow morning to take us to Denver, where I had a flight to California waiting!\n A ride was scheduled to arrive at the hotel that same morning to pick me up. Finally! Tomorrow was Christmas Eve, so there was still time to make it to California for Christmas.\n\nThe shuttle arrived as planned that morning, and while there was still plenty of snow on the ground, the blizzard had stopped for the time being.\nMe and the same guy as before were dropped off at the airport, where we and many others awaited our flight out of here. My nerves couldn't handle much more, and I was looking forward to not eating pizza for a few months at least.\nWe had been waiting for a few hours, when news arrived. \n\nIt wasn't coming.\n\nWhat?!\n\nNope, it's not coming. The flight got held up, it's lost, it's late... I don't remember, and I didn't really care. \nAll that mattered was, it wasn't coming. And that's when something in my brain broke.\nThis is my life now. I need to accept the fact that I'm staying in Wyoming... forever. Living off pizza and Star Trek for the rest of my days. Which in hindsight doesn't sound all that bad, actually, but anyways.\nI called my family again, and told them I had no idea when I was coming. And not to wait up. I have no control over the situation, so I'm just going to sit in this cold empty airport, until they tell me I need to leave.\n\nSo that's what I do. I sit there, listening to my music, and trying not to care. \nThen more news arrives. The (wonderful) flight crew that is also stuck here, grab a bunch of us and tell us that an alternate\nplan has been arranged. A van.\n\n(To be continued in Part II)",

        "text": "I took my daughter in to the local 'Shoe Mart' to buy some boots this morning. It was quiet, and there was only one employee working. She was very nice, full of smiles and wanting to be helpful.\n\nUnfortunately, she doesn't seem to know the first thing about how shoes work. I've never encountered anything quite like this before. \n\nWe needed to size my daughter's feet, and while I was quite happy to do it myself, the clerk seemed to really want to help and I didn't want to discourage her go-to attitude, so I let her take over. \n\nFirst of all, she asked my seven year old which side was her right side. I smiled, thinking she was humoring my daughter and giving her a chance to show off her knowledge of what's what, like you do. However, it soon became very apparent that the clerk in fact was unable to tell right from left, and she argued a bit with the seven year old when her answer wasn't what the clerk wanted it to be. So I stepped in, assuring the clerk that yes, that was indeed her right foot, and we moved on to measuring.\n\nSo you know how you push your heel back to the end of the thing, stand up, and mark your size by the where the end of your toe reaches on the measuring device? Nope. We've all be doing it wrong! The clerk proceeded to very carefully mark the center of the arch of the foot, hold her finger just there while my daughter lifted her foot per request, then the clerk read the measurement where her finger was. \"She's a size 6 or 7!\"\n\n\"Um, no. She's actually size 3.\"\n\n\"Really? Okay. Why don't we try a 13 then?\"\n\n. . .\n\nThis went back and forth for a while, with me quietly grabbing shoes for myself (thankfully this is Shoe Mart, where all the stock is out on the shelves and not in the back!) until I found a kid-approved, well fitting shoe. Meanwhile the clerk keeps suggesting shoes in different random sizes, never coming within 2 sizes of the correct one!\n\nI fully expected to walk out to a hidden camera, but alas! she really was that clueless!\n\nWhat is the world coming to?",

There is also no moving belt that takes the groceries to the bagging area.  The checker takes the groceries out of the basket, scans them and, if there is no bagger, starts bagging them as she scans.\n\nThe checker greets me and I realize she's new because she has to look up almost every code for non-tagged veggies.  No problem.\n\nSo she's checking my groceries but not bagging them.  She's just stacking them up.  She's not even using all the space she has to stack them, she's just stacking them up right next to the scanner.\n\nAs I have a lot of groceries, this immediately becomes untenable.  Her solution?  With each item she scans, she eyes the ever-growing stack and says \"I need some help\".\n\nExcept she's not saying this to anyone but me.\n\nVery quickly, the little space she's using to stack my groceries is full.  It is actually over-full.  Some of my groceries topple off onto the floor.\n\nShe picks them up and puts them right back on top, where they threaten to topple off again.\n\nEventually, the manager notices and comes over to bag my groceries.\n\nI was very, very patient.",

It was an American diner inspired joint that commanded average prices (nothing top end but not a fast food place) \n\n5 minutes after our meal was served the lights, radio, heating all went off. There was a power cut in the local area. 5 minutes later we were asked by a waitress \"Apart from the lights is everything okay?\". We spent the next 20 minutes eating our meal in complete darkness before a member of staff left to go to a local shop to buy candles and we were offered a candle for our table.\n\nAt this stage the novelty wore off and most of the other diners had already left so we went to pay the bill assuming it would be discounted. The person who appeared to be in a supervisory role at the till jotted up how much we owed and asked us for the full amount without so much as an apology. Now I understand it wasn't their fault, but it certainly wasn't ours.\n\nWhat should I do about this? As I was with my girlfriend she was very worried about me making a scene so I refrained from disputing the bill but surely it is not acceptable to charge the full price?\n\nHere's a pic I snapped when I thought it was hilarious before the novelty wore off:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/frYA6lb",

        "text": "We bought a fairly expensive tent trailer last April.  It is made in a town about 20 miles from us and after seeing it at our local RV store, we fell in love.\n\nOne of the features of this particular tent trailer is that you can configure it to have two twin beds or one, bigger-than-kingsize bed.\n\nIn order to do the bigger-than-kingsize bed, you use two table-like platforms to bridge the gap between the two twin platforms.\n\nAlso, one of these table-like platforms could be installed in a different configuration so that you had two twin beds with a table between them.\n\nThe salesman told us the company was running a bit behind in the manufacture of these platforms, but they would send them to us as soon as they had them.  No problem.\n\nWe used the tent trailer several times last summer and it was great!  By the end of summer, we had heard nothing from the company about our tables so I emailed their customer support person.\n\nAfter a week of not hearing back, I emailed again.  After another week, I called.  The customer support person said they were still having trouble with their manufacturer but expected to have our tables in 12 weeks.  Again, no problem.\n\nOf course, 12 weeks come and go and nothing.  So I email again.  A week passes and no response.  By this time, I'm getting peeved about the lack of response so I send another email and ask if there is someone else I should be speaking to.  The next day, the customer service person sends out an email saying that they have been unable to resolve their problems with their manufacturer so they will be making the tables themselves and we should be getting ours by Thanksgiving.\n\nOf course, Thanksgiving comes and goes and no word.  I wait until a week ago and I email again, asking for a status.  That's all I want.  I just want to know what their timeframe is looking like.\n\nA week passes and no response.  So I call this morning and the customer service rep is not in, so I tell the woman who answers the phone that I'm getting angry that not only do I not have the tables, but I can't seem to get an answer from the customer service rep when I contact her.  She says she knows they are working through their list of backorders and if I want, I can leave a voice mail for the customer service rep, so I do.\n\nShe calls me back two hours later.\n\nCustomer service woman: \"You're local, right?\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\nCSW: \"I'm pulling the tables for all our local clients right now and you can come and get them whenever you want\".\n\nNow, I'm quite certain she made the part about \"pulling the tables for all our local clients\", but I tell her I'll be there today to pick our tables up.  She tells me she is leaving at 3:30pm, but she'll leave our tables with the other orders and anyone can give them to us.\n\nTwo hours later, my husband and I drive over.  We walk in and in the lobby there are our tables with our names on them.  There are no other orders in the lobby.  There are no other orders in any of the 5 rooms I can see into off the lobby.\n\nI'm very happy to have my tables, but I can't fathom why she wouldn't just email  a status and why she felt it necessary to tell me she was delivering the tables to all the local customers today.\n\nI'm certain if I hadn't fussed, I still wouldn't have my tables.",

        "text": "A little history. My wife and I were married 18 years ago, at which time she took my last name. We moved to our current house in 2000. At that point we set up our utilities, some in my name, some in hers (proof of address). We of course set up two phone lines, one for the dial up internet and the other for a regular phone line. A few years after that, we upgraded to broadband through our cable company, porting one number (bundle deal) but keeping the land-line for our security system.\n\nFast forward to now. We finally upgraded our security system to something from the 21st century and no longer need a traditional land-line (the only time it came in handy in the last decade was during Sandy). So I call up our cable company to port over the second number as my wife and I work at home often for our small practice and we're going to make one of our two phone lines dedicated to work (sometimes a cell phone just won't do). Here comes the problems.\n\nThe cable account is in my wife's name. She is not home today. The cable company won't port over the line without her being present. Keep in mind we've both been paying various bills addressed, to either of us, from either of us for over a decade. I'm also our home IT department, meaning I handle all the tech in our house, so basically any questions will end up coming back to me. \n\nNow, fortunately, I live in one of the few places where there is broadband competition. Additionally, the company I have my land-line with is the broadband competitor who has been begging us to switch over to their cable/internet service for a long time. And if I needed an additional incentive, I hate the son of our cable company's owner for giving me almost two decades (and counting) of horrible NBA basketball, and wouldn't be that upset to give him less money. However, I'm also lazy and didn't feel like resetting up our entire home network for essentially zero savings. What they don't realize though, is that I WILL take my business elsewhere if you anger me off enough, even if the competitor doesn't provide as good of service as you.\n\nSo I start with a low-level customer rep. He immediately describes to me how my wife needs to be with me because her name is on the account. Now I guess I could have faked it and raised my voice an octave but I was too flabbergasted to do that. I spelled out that we are family unit, all the bills go into and out of the same bank account pots, and it's just happenstance that the account is in my wife's name. No dice. After a little back and forth (as I quickly log into the account and try to add my name), I finally tell him we're done. It only took until the third request for him to transfer me to his supervisor.\n\nThe supervisor gives me the same story. I explained how my wife was likely not home the last time we ported a number as she had a job that didn't let her work from home at the time and I did, so I don't see what the issue is now. Yawn. I describe how I already have the competition's sign up page as they will be my next call unless we resolve this matter. Still no dice. \n\nI pointed out I wasn't trying to sign an affidavit or power of attorney in her name, I just wanted to give my cable company more money a month to add a second phone line to my plan. I'm not even threatening to cut the cord (though I was starting to wonder how much it would be to get a huge antenna on my house's roof that could get in both Philadelphia and NYC stations). Nope. So, tired of all this, I ask him how to return their equipment when I cancel and what other steps I need to take when I transfer to the competitor. ... Please hold.\n\nI finally get to the supervisor's supervisor who, after examining the issue and talking to the third party who transfer the phones and some other crap, is willing to make an exception in my case. He even waived a fee (that was probably going to be waived anyway). Terrific.\n\nNow that only took 25 minutes of my time. And the porting hasn't happened yet. But still, what the deuce?\n\nAnd now that I have just finished typing all this up, I see my modem is blinking meaning my Internet is down again (I did get an alert that the were working in the area but an interesting coincidence, no?). Sigh.\n\nTL;TR - I had to threaten my cable company that I was going to come in, pour beer on their servers and then rip off their heads and poop down their throats unless they allowed me to pay them more money.  \n\nEDIT - grammar",

My wife has the genetic predisposition of [tasting soap whenever cilantro is present](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/14curious.html?_r=0). It's not an allergen, it just renders food inedible. Whenever we go out, she always takes extra care to make sure the food she orders doesn't have it. I do not have the same worries but it's all good to me.\n\nWe went out to eat at a TGIChilibees last night, and they had some new items on the menu. No hint of cilantro in the descriptions, great- let's give them a try.\n\nYup, soap. They apparently use a new kind of relish on these dishes, and there was no documentation anywhere on the included seasonings. (Who pairs cilantro with granny smith apples, anyway?) She has never sent food back before and felt horrible but we had no choice. We explained it to the server who was all cool about it and swapped it out for something else without as much as a peep.\n\nI did end up tipping extra (always 20% minimum, more if we have a good experience) and noted an apology on the receipt, but what else could we have done? Granted, we didn't ask the server outright in this case but they may not have known. Could I have done anything better?",

Most of the employee's at this gas station are spouses of contractors or active duty personnel.\n\nA timeless joke that is unfortunately true (fortunately rare, at least from what I've seen) are the \"dependapotamus's\" (mix between a hippo and a dependent (spouse)). These are the spouses of active duty people that are very large, gross, rude, and are severely entitled nice. \n\nFor the past few years I've worked on the installation, I'll go to the gas station to gas up because it's wicked cheap and buy booze because it's wicked cheap - win win. There is this one employee there, and she has a truly miserable life. I've worked retail for a few years and I know how hard It can be at times and the people you have to deal with can be sour, but she is all of them summed up into one disrespectful person.\n\nJust today this happened. \"Me\" will be me, \"H\" will be her, and \"CW\" will be her co-worker.\n\nI walk up with some frozen food and a drink for work tonight and had the option of choosing CW's lane or her lane. As I walk up I hear her shout:\n\n\nH: \"Oh my god I can't believe I have to deal with customers still! I've been here all day and I just want to leave! UGH! This is so stupid!\" (She was scanning an officer's items and he just gave her a blank stare)\n\nHearing this from her I decided that since the officer was the last guy in her lane, she would shut down and leave. I didn't want to deal with her because I've dealt with her in the past. So I get into CW's line of just a few people.\n\n\nH: \"I can help you if you come into my lane you know!\" \n\nThe people in CW's lane turn around and look at me. That's my queue to move over.

I work here.\" she rasped.\n\nMe: \"That's...nice.\" I say in a polite tone.\n\nH: \"I've been working here since noon\" (it's about 5 p.m. now) \"and I'm so sick and tired. My feet hurt and I'm hungry and just UGH!\"\n\nM: \"...\" I just smiled at her as she scanned my items.\n\nI moved to the card reader to scan my card and as I pull my wallet out she drops my frozen food on the floor, sorry, dumps it on the floor, like how the hell can you get it that far away from the counter kind of drop. No big deal. Just a pot pie and a hungry man meal. I pick it up and go to hand it to her and she just stares at me. I don't feel comfortable reaching across to the counter and placing my items into the bag when her stomach is in the way... I'm not wearing the proper PPE to deal with this biohazard. She continues to stare when I hear CW say:\n\n\nCW: \"Seriously!? That's about the 12th time today you've DROPPED a persons items. Why do you keep doing that?\"\n\nH: \"Oops. Whatever. Can I go home now? This is ridiculous.\" \n\n\nI can't believe what I'm hearing (and smelling). This isn't the first time, let alone the worst time I've dealt with her, but really? She still continued to just stare me down. Then she had the audacity to say:\n\n\nH: \"So are you going to swipe your card or what, I'm busy.\" I'm the last guy in the store, yet they don't close for several more hours.\n\nMe: \"...uh....yeah...excuse me.\" I replied as I pinched the corner of the bag, slid it towards me and put my items in. I swiped my card, paid, and grabbed my bag.\n\nNow I've always been asked if I would like my receipt, I never do so before they even ask I say I'm all set on the receipt, thank them, tell them to have a good day, and be on my way. \n\n\nMe: \"All set on the receipt, thank you! Hope you have a good day!\"\n\nShe was turned around complaining about something to CW, so I assumed she heard me and began to walk off. As I near the door with bag in hand,\n\n\nH: \"So do you want your receipt?\" She said this as if I was a dog that just took a piss on the carpet and was running away.\n\nMe: I stopped and turned \"Oh, no thank you, I'm all set, thanks though!\"\n\nH: \"Yeah, okay\" in the most sarcastic tone I have ever heard.\n\nShe's been there for years. I've never complained, I don't know of anybody else who has, nobody has the time to complain really. But the audacity to act so rude and entitled to people, I can't believe it. She's married too.

When we booked it, there was an option for a breakfast for 2 for just $10 more (total).  We decided that $5 a piece for breakfast would be nice, so we went for it.\n\nWe checked in, got to our room, went to the party, came back, etc.  No problems.  In the morning, we go to the breakfast cafe to grab the breakfast that we ordered.  We explain that we got the breakfast option and she tells us that we need some type of coupon.  Alright.  It must be in my e-mail or something.\n\nI check my e-mail.  Nothing there.  I go to the front desk to figure it out.  I ask the front desk clerk (FDC) how I go about getting a coupon for the breakfast as I didn't receive an e-mail or any information regarding it.  Here's the exchange that follows:\n\nFDC: You should have received a coupon.  The cafe is run by different owners.\n\nMe: Well, I didn't receive a coupon or anything.  Is it supposed to come by e-mail or what?\n\nFDC: Yes, you should have received it.\n\nMe: Well, I don't seem to have anything emailed to me.  You can look at the email confirmation on my phone.  It doesn't say anything at all about the breakfast option.\n\nFDC: Are you sure that your paid for the breakfast option when booking?\n\nMe: Absolutely.  I paid $10 extra for it.  What's the normal rate for the room?\n\nFDC: $120.\n\nMe: Well I clearly paid $130, as you can see by the receipt.  Unless I was overcharged.  \n\nFDC:  Oh, your room is (on some other level, I don't recall) and those are more expensive.\n\nMe:  No, it's definitely in (the area where we are staying) and that's what we paid for.  Let me grab my laptop to show you what I mean.\n\n*I go and grab my laptop from my room.  I pull up the hotel's website and my e-mails from them.*\n\nMe: Alright.  So, if I try and book a room, it comes to $120.  If I had the breakfast option, it comes to $130. *I show her the steps, comparing the name of the room in the e-mail to the one I pulled up online*  So, clearly, I paid for the breakfast option, right?  \n\nFDC: Alright.  You did pay $10 more for that room.\n\nMe: So, how do I get the coupon to go get my breakfast?\n\nFDC: It should have been e-mailed to you.\n\nMe: I understand that.  It wasn't e-mailed to me, though.  So, what can I do about that?\n\nFDC: There's nothing we can do.  You should have gotten it in your confirmation e-mail.\n\nMe:  That doesn't make sense to me.  You've agreed that I paid $10 extra for my room and that I selected the breakfast option, but I clearly just received no emails regarding it.  You have to be able to do something about it.\n\nFDC (looking bored): I'm sorry there's nothing we can do.\n\nAt this point, I am getting pissed because I am basically giving $10 away for nothing.\n\nMe: Do you have a manager I can talk to or something?  I just feel like I should be able to do SOMETHING in this situation.  I understand that it's not showing up correctly, but I don't know why I'm being penalized because your systems messed up.\n\n*An older lady (OL) that has been around the entire time finally steps in.  FDC just steps away and works on something else.*\n\nMe: Hello.  I'm sure you've heard what I've been trying to explain.\n\nOL: Yes.  The cafe is run by different owners, so we can't really do anything.\n\nMe:  Well, I gave my extra $10 to this hotel.  Can I please just have a refund?  If nothing else, your colleague has already agreed that we at least overpaid for the room, regardless of whether or not we included the breakfast option.\n\nOL: I guess so...\n\nAnd I finally get a refund.  This drove me insane.  My wife and I just drove back the 30 mins home and went to a local restaurant.  It was such a huge ordeal.  The clerk didn't know the room rates.  The website didn't have anything printed on the receipt about the breakfast.  Neither of the employees felt empowered to take care of the situation before I practically demanded it.\n\nI never lost my temper when talking to them because I know it seemed like a glitch in the system, but I did get annoyed with going over the same things multiple times.  I have a feeling that the system just isn't set up correctly at all and the employees have no idea how the breakfast thing actually works.\n\nEdit: Just changed it to FDL in all cases.  Don't know why I changed it or what that would stand for.",

        "text": "Go into a big game retail store to get a game that had come out the prior week. My friends all had it and were playing it so cool, no problem buying it. Because it is a fairly new game the store is selling mostly new copies, but there is one used copy on the shelf. There's only a $5 difference and I would rather buy new (since some money goes to someone besides the retailer and may at some point fund the devs). I bring up the new box and this exchange takes place:\n\n*Clerk Lady: Hi, this game is online only is that okay? Also, did you know that we have a copy used for cheaper?*\n\n*Me: I didn't, thanks for letting me know. Shouldn't be an issue though since I have an internet connect. Yeah, I think I saw the used copy, its okay though. I'll just take the new.*\n\n*Clerk Lady: Really? The used is cheaper and it is on a blu-ray disc which is virtually scratch-proof.*\n\n*Me: I'm good thanks. I'll just take the new copy since its been out for not too long and I kind of want to just get the new copy and unwrap it and get the manual and everything in nice crisp condition, you know?*\n\n*Clerk Lady: No....I don't*\n\n*Me: Uh....okay. How much is it?*\n\n*Clerk Lady: I haven't rung it up yet. I really think you should get the used copy and save yourself some money.*\n\n--At this point I was getting a little annoyed but I wasn't being short or mean. I've worked in retail enough years to understand meeting numbers and all that, but this was getting out of hand.--\n\n*Me: Uh...thanks for looking out but it is fine. I'll just take what I brought up, thanks.*\n\n*Clerk Lady: With our used copies you also get a return policy that lets you return it within a week! With new once you open it you can't return it.*\n\n*Me: Yeah, no, I'll take this one thanks.*\n\n--At this point I was digging in. It has gone from a matter of personal preference to something else. That is when the manager showed up--\n\n*Manager (with a coy smile): You seem to have an issue with buying used games?*\n\n*Me: Nooooo, not exactly. I buy plenty of things used, from cars to game. I just don't want to right now. I want this please.*\n\n*Manager: It's cheaper you know? To buy used.*\n\n--I'm done now. I've sold club cards, warranties, magazine subscriptions, etc. I have **never** taken this long to ring someone up. Keep in mind, these stores only have one person ringing. There are at least five people behind me. Doesn't matter though. I need to buy this game used, other people be damned!--\n\n*Me: I'm aware, I am 100% percent aware of the five dollars I would save. Fortunately,  if I wasn't, this woman at checkout made me aware. But, I don't want it used, and I see plenty of new copies. Please ring me up right now. Like I initially wanted, and no more comments about the used copy. I'm sorry but this has gotten silly.*\n\n--At this point the Clerk Lady snatches (literally snatches) the empty display box out of my hands, grabs a new copy and begins ringing it up. No total, no asking if I'd like a receipt, none of the usual things. The next line Clerk Lady says under her breathe (but still loud enough for me to hear it) while she scans the box and the transaction **finally** proceeds.--\n\n*Clerk Lady: Fine, you can buy this game that is online-only and no one is going to play in a week. With roaming bands of twelve year-olds finding people to gank for experience. There's no point in buying this kind of crap anyways.*\n\n--Clerk Lady rips the receipt from the printer and says the next line in a fake chipper voice--\n\n*Clerk Lady: Enjoy!*\n\n--I've had it. I have never treated a customer as I have been treated. I was still working in retail, at a store less than a mile away, and two things are very important here:\n\n1) Being in retail, a new $60 game isn't anything to sneeze at.\n\n2) I have the same kinds of interactions all day at work. You need to gauge the customer and tell if they just want their product and to leave, or want to chat it up a bit. I've had the extremes of both, most likely in the same month this transaction was taking place in, and never got in a customers face like this.\n\n\nI throw the game I **finally** got and the receipt on the table--\n\n*Me: You know what? Forget it, I want to return this. I understand your policies, I understand figures and goals and all this, but this has gotten out of hand. I came into the store wanting to buy something and I've been treated horribly! You both need to learn how customer service works.*\n\n--I turn to other customers--\n\n*Me: I'm sorry, all I wanted to do is buy this and it has become an issue apparently.*\n\n*Manager: Well, I've been a manager at this store for thirteen years an-*\n\n*Me: I don't care! I honestly don't! It obviously takes more than that to teach you manners and basic customer service! I have been working retail for five years with two as a manager and I wouldn't let my employees talk like a customer like that! Also, I would open up a line with this many customers waiting in this small of a store! You have two registers!*\n\n--The Clerk is stunned and the manager is fuming. I don't care. I am seeing red at this point and just want to go for the throat--\n\n*Me: You are going to return this and I will drive to a store that is less than a mile away and buy this. No harassment, no talking back nothing! And, if by some weird warp in the universe the next store does this, I got three more to choose from! I'll make sure I never come here again! Now, return this and please do not say anything else except 'The amount has been returned on your card' or 'have a nice day'.*\n\n--And that's what happened. Got it returned and bought the game somewhere else. I also went into another store from the same chain (less than a ten miles away) and explained the situation and got the district manager's number. I called and let him know what was going on. I don't know if anything came of it, because I never went back like I said. I felt kind of bad, because I hate the days when a customer got mad and yelled at me, but then I remember that I never treated a single customer like that ever. I was telling the truth then, I worked in food service, landscaping, and retail. At this point I had worked in retail for five years with two being a manager. At no point did I have an incident like this. \n\nWas I in the wrong with yelling at them?--\n",

        "text": "Late last winter I decided I had enough money for a shiny new laptop. I go on **Big Box Retailer** website and find one that's perfect! It's a touch screen, on sale, and just perfect. So I want to order it for pickup at my local store. Sadly, the nearest store that has it is a town south of me (about an hour drive). At this point, I really want this laptop so I say \"eh fine\" and order it.\n\n\n\n\nWell it comes time to pick the thing up, and I drive into town. I go up to Customer Service and tell them my name. \n\n&gt;\"Well, I'm sorry ma'am, we don't have that in stock.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"What do you mean? I paid for it already. It said you had it when I ordered it. Did you sell it?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"No, ma'am. We never had it to begin with.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Then why did it say you did?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"We may have sold our last one just as you bought yours\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Ok well I really wanted that one but I guess there isn't anything you can do. Although I don't quite know what to do now since you already have my money. Plus I drove over an hour to get to this specific store for this\"\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Well, let's see if we have anything you might like equally.\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Sounds reasonable\"\n\n\n\nSo he shows me some of their laptops, but none of them are near the same deal. All the ones in my price range aren't similar enough to what I was getting.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Well, okay, I talked to my manager and he said I can offer you a $100 credit because we won't be getting the one you want ever again apparently. So it's the best we can do to make you whole again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Wow, thank you! In that case, I like this one over here\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Oh yeah we don't have that one either\"\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Okaaaay, how about this one?\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Nope, out of that one, too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"So you have nothing that I can afford then?\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Uh it looks like we don't\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Well, I see that you have the laptop I wanted as a floor model. Can I buy that one? You won't be needing it if you aren't getting any more in, correct?\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"I don't know if I can sell you that.\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\"You sell floor models in the back all the time, though. I've looked at them.\"\n\n\n\n\nHe goes to talk to manager and eventually tells us no. We go home.\n\n\n\n\nThen I get a call saying \"Okay actually we figured out that we can sell you it because it has a small scratch so technically we can sell it to you as damaged.\"\n\n\n\n&gt;\"No other damage, though?\"\n\n\n\n&gt;\"No ma'am. Would you like it?\"\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\nSo I drove another hour there and back for this laptop I'm typing on. It's a great laptop, so I guess it ended well.",

The job sucks, the people suck, but this girl...damn, if I had been a meaner customer she would have been in trouble.\n\nI asked at the box for a burger, drink, and no fries. She starts trying to push me getting a side. Each time I politely say \"No, thanks.\" She even says that it's free with the meal, but again I say no. \n\nAs I pull around I hear her, loudly, say \"She just asked for a burger and drink, no fries!\" and flutter-roll her eyes. Sheepishly, I give her the money. As she's getting my change, another woman (supervisor, I assume) comes up and corrects her saying I was overcharged for a full meal instead of just a burger and drink... \n\nMore talking, more typing at her computer as she gives me my $10 back, then yells back to someone in the store that she gave me my change back. \n\nThe window was open the entire time, and there was never a \"Sorry\" or \"Thank you for understanding.\" The cashier didn't sound happy, didn't thank me as I pulled up.\n\nI hope she doesn't get yelled at by another customer, but damn...",
