        "text": "I was with my previous partner for 6 years (lived together for 2.5 years) until Oct, 22, when after a fairly long rough patch she decided that maybe it was better that we break up. Since then we've had no contact, aside from both attending a close mutual friend's birthday.\n\nDuring our relationship I really didn't have any doubts that we were well suited - we did everything together and for the most part were really happy in each others company. It was the first relationship I've had without doubts and everything just felt right. Towards the end of the relationship we'd both begun to really feel less and less like ourselves - I'd lost touch with friends, didn't have the confidence to pursue personal hobbies alone, and just generally felt lost without the resolve to fix problems.\n\nSince breaking up I've really focused on working on myself through exercise, pushing myself to try new experiences and trying not to let life get the better of me or get hung up on the small things. I'm feeling like I'm in a really good place for the first time in at least a couple of years, and am excited about the future and continuing to develop a more positive relationship with myself.\n\nWhen we broke up I'd always felt that there was a high chance we'd find each other again in the future because of how the majority of the relationship had been and the strong match we were. Naturally I avoided talking too much to friends and family about this because I understand it's typical to feel that way post-breakup and I didn't want people to think I was just using the hope of getting back together as an emotional crutch.\n\nToday we caught up on a phone call for the first time in 3 months and out of the blue she mentioned that she'd been missing me and was to some extent wondering if we shouldn't see each other to see how things go - with a view of working toward being together again. There's no point in beating around the bush, I'm leaning towards really wanting too, as not having her in my life has left a big hole. That said, the place i'm in mentally right now feels really stable and secure and I'm really scared of the impact that us reconnecting could have on that, as well as is she just going to change her mind again and I have to go through this heartache for a second time.\n\nBe interested to hear what you guys think and if anyone has similar stories to share.\n\ntl;dr: ex girlfriend reached out wanting to give things another shot but I'm worried about how that will affect the positive relationship I've begun developing with myself\n\nThanks",

Which isn’t an issue really but I’ve always had the idea in my head that that wasn’t something I really wanted, I had no desire for it. But He likes the idea and he thinks about it pretty often I feel. \n\nhe says there’s no rush to do it but he really wants it and I can tell bc he mentions it a lot even when we have an argument. And for that I have an eerie feeling about it, and i just don’t think it’s something we’re “ready for” in our relationship cause of some particular issues. i.e. like not telling me things or accusing me of something when I did nothing. \n\nI’m all for trying new things even sexually but when I feel ready and prepared to do so. This would be something very drastic for me don t know if you can really physically prepare yourself for something like that. we’ve discussed it more which kind of helped and I’ve been a little more open to the idea. \n\nBut I also think he’s been considering doing it with his friend without me. Which brings me to an even bigger concern bc this friend said he wanted to be apart of said 3some but I don’t know him and never even met him or spoke with him. But he seems very eager to do it and I think bc of that they’ve been planning one more so to do on there own.. And makes me not want to do it at all honestly. \n\nTL;DR\nAm I being too paranoid? Or am I rightfully questioning?",

        "text": "So, to setup the background for this. Last summer me and this girl went out on 2 dates before she had to go back to school (last weeks of summer) she said she just wanted to get fucked before summer ends so that she’ll have slept with more than just one person before going on a semester abroad for college. We never fucked, we made out on the dates and felt each other up, she touched my dick and said something under her breath I didn’t catch. she backed out when I proposed we take it back to my place. I had a great time on the dates, she said she did too.but I said that I guess we remove eachother now. And she said that she didn’t want that and sent a sad face, so we’ve never removed each other off of snap and talk occasionally, and she had asked for me to send dick pics which she saved (thought it was weird but I’m a horny young adult so I sent) she’s made comments about it, and I kinda feel like that’s all I am to her.\n\nFast forward a few months to today, still been talking occasionally. I popped the question of why we’re still talking after she’s been in another state this whole time and I don’t see us meeting up and we don’t really talk a lot. To which she replied with ‘idk, i’m not like running out of snapchat friends or anything so I like only maybe lose out on something if i remove u’. I didn’t really understand that so I just said that I’ll leave it as is, and that us still talking every other week without a prospect of meeting up just confused me.\n\nI just feel like she wants to keep me around so if she’s ever back in town she can call me up and get dicked down. Any opinions are welcomed. Considering just removing her off snap, because of this and don’t know if it’s an overreaction on my end.\n\nTL:DR: Old fling never hooked up with saved my dick pics and we’ve never done anything else (didn’t fuck just made out) didn’t want me to remove her from snap a while back, now I don’t know what this most recent response means when I asked why were still taking. The response in question: ‘idk, i’m not like running out of snapchat friends or anything so I like only maybe lose out on something if i remove u’.",

She has helped me learn how to relax in my dating life, and always offers for me to go out with one of the guys that she has been involved with, if I am looking for any casual fun.\n\nThe only time that I have taken her up on this is this last weekend (I am not big on hookups, so this was the first time I’ve really wanted to). She introduced me to her longtime friend, who she has occasionally hooked up with (let’s call him B). She encouraged me to hook up with him. When I asked her if she was sure, she insisted that she has no jealousy/romantic hangups with her hookup buddies.\n\nThe next days B and I spent the whole day together talking and driving around, with just some making out in the end. Turns out that we get along REALLY well. M asked me how it was going the next day, and I told her. When I said that we spent most of it just talking, her face changed. She began going on and on about how she just loves him and values him so much, and about how she has been with him through so much. She looked shocked when I said that he offered for me to come by his place anytime. She left before I could ask her if she was really comfortable with me spending time with him.\n\nI have no real plan with him, but after spending time with him I have realized that there is a chance that this could develop into something more serious, as our personalities are so well matched, and also because he seems to be interested in something a bit more serious. I think that M was only good with the idea because she did not think that there would be a real connection, but I am starting to feel uncomfortable with the fact that she expects me to only be intimate with him in a way that is to her preference, as she is the one who encouraged me to go after him. I do not want to loose a good friendship, but her reaction felt very controlling and unhealthy.\n\nTLDR: my friend only seems comfortable with me going out with him if it is just physical, and it feels a bit controlling",

For example today, she woke up from a nap and called me and said she had a nightmare that we stopped talking and a bunch of other bad stuff happened. \n\nThen later that night I was 20 mins late to the time we usually phone each other and when I did phone, she was crying saying she thought I had forgotten about her, she explained she was still emotional from the bad dream she had. She then asked why I didn't seem more phased by her sobbing ( im not really one to show emotion ) as if she wanted me to react? Then she'll get annoyed with me because I didn't \"kiss her goodnight first\"\n\nThis happens often, like once a week she'll call me crying about something e.g. her boss that shouted at her - it's not like I'm not empathetic but I've got enough stuff to stress about already (my own career and responsibilities)\n\nAnyway I guess I'm not even sure what I'm trying to achieve with this post lol, I'm seeing her in April and I'll see where I take the relationship from there. \n\nAny insights or advice to shed some new light on the situation would be greatly appreciated! \n\nTL:DR Losing feelings in long distance relationship because I am feeling burdened with partner's emotions",

        "text": "So I have been with my girlfriend for roughly 2 and half years now and we are both college students.  I truly care about this person a lot and I am not sure if my feelings are clouding my judgement.\n\nI am wondering for some opinions on the following situation:\n\nEarly on in our relationship there was a time she told me she was going to the store quick but ended up at a guys house for a bonfire. There were 3 people there and she was the only girl. She hid this from me by turning off the Snapchat map feature but ended up admitting what she did was wrong but said she did not cheat or do anything wrong.\n\nA couple months following this we were hanging out on the Fourth of July and she made the comment that she wanted to go over to the same guys house for a bonfire after we were done hanging out so I got upset and told her I would just go home and that’s where she went. Afterwords we got into many arguments about this where she admitted all this was wrong and I assumed this would be the end of this.\n\nLast week which is roughly a year and half later from the previous events. I came into the room to see her on her phone and see that she was talking to this same person again. I got upset and questioned her and she said this person is coming in for 2 appointments for school at roughly 4 hours per appointment. Big time commitment for someone you are presumed not to be very close with. For reference everyone else who has been coming in for her has been myself and her family. Anyways she said it was school related and I never asked her to cancel I just said can you block him once this is over bc you said you guys were not talking anymore. She agreed. Then came the time when it was over and she refused got angry and said this is controlling. For reference I do not have any girls I am friends with besides my girlfriend. And she has made comments along the lines that if i were to go to the bars with my old high school friends she wouldn’t want to date me anymore. This is a non issue to me bc I have no interest in that lifestyle I am just mentioning to highlight how she also does not like me doing certain things like that which is totally fine with me .Following this all today we got into an argument and may possibly be broken up.\n\nPlease leave your opinions am I wrong for feeling this way and expecting her to block him given this history?\n\nTl;dr am I right to feel this way given this history? Or is she right and this is too far and controlling?",

I can honestly say that I had deep feelings for her and cared for tremendously. She has a birthday coming up and I was going to surprise her with an engagement ring. However, I recently learned so information that has made second guess the entire relationship.  When we first started dating, I asked her how many guys she had been with before me.  She told me 7.  I was uncomfortable with it but accepted it.  Now I come to find out thanks to one of her college roommates that she’s actually been with more than double that.  Turns out she was a party girl all throughout college. It took me by surprise because she didn’t seem like that type. I’m upset because had she been honest, we both could’ve spent the last two years finding people better suited for us. I feel like I wasted the past two years of my life. When I asked her about it, she broke down crying and told me it was true. I’ve already returned the engagement ring. Now I just need advice on what to do now.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my girlfriend lied to me about her past.",

        "text": "my bf and i have a mutual friend from highschool. lets call her Julia (fake name). she was my bestfriend in those years and then i went to another school, so the distance seperated us. we were not bestfriends anymore but we were still friends. after i left, she met my bf (him and i, we didnt know each other in highschool. so we were not together in those days) and became bestfriends with him. years passed and i met my boyfriend, found out we went to same highschool for 2 years. he told me Julia is his bestfriend and i was happy to be close to her again. Julia's bf (20M) and my bf was their bestfriends since they were children. (im gonna call him Carl, also a fake name) so i thought we'd be a great family since everyone is so close to each other. \n\ni was wrong. Julia changed a lot. she was never the sweettiest girl like she used to be. she was so helpful, kind, innocent that i was always ready to beat some ass to protect her. she was the fragile one. but years ruined her. she became a disgusting rude person, she is an arrogant and a manipulating girl i can never imagine now. then i realized she was manipulating to keep my bf beside her. she was using him to protect herself from the others. \n\nmy bf had a crush on her when he first saw her but his bestfriend Carl wanted to make a move so my bf step back, let him have Julia. Julia knew what was exactly going on and she used him. she even made him tell \"julia, if i get a girl and she would be jealous of you, i'd leave her right in that moment\" she made a perfect place to his heart and his life. and she never wanted to be close to me like we used to be. in fact, she is trying to ignore me and exclude me from the conversations. \n\ni get a bad vibe from her. and this is the part that really hurts me. \n\nmy boyfriend is under her impression. even though he says that i am the love of his life. he acts like that person is Julia, not me. he compares us all the time and telling me she is better than me in almost every way. he once told me \"she is braver and funnier than you\" when we were on the vacation just because i didnt jump off a stupid bridge with him. he laughs with her more, he has fun with her more. he always finds her right no matter what. for example, when she does a bad thing that my bf would never approve and make them regret the second they tell him they did this thing, he wouldnt care and always says \"if Julia did this, she has her own reasons\" \n\nalso they are extremly touchy to each other. she always touching him somehow, always has a reason. like scratching his big-bodybuilder-muscular back or massaging it, or she plays with his hair. and he loves taking her into his arms to hug, wrestle or just jump on her in the middle of the sea as a joke. she always calls him 'babe, love, honey, sweetheart' etc. they hang out mostly in the late hours. my bf usually call her \"man, bro, buddy etc.\" but she never does\n\nshe once saw a wet dream about him and told it to my bf, i still dont understand what is the purpose of this??\n\ni talked to him about it. i told him that he has feelings for her and she is using him for it but he denied as expected. so i told him even though those are all normal things to them, i feel uncomfortable. then he said he will be more careful and he can even cut her off. but i know he didn't mean it, he would hate me the rest of his life. so i told him to be more careful. then he did for 2 days or smt. but he was always angry and treated me bad. he was never happy. just bc he was being CAREFUL. even didnt want him to cut her off \n\nso i talked to him again and told him it was my mistake, he can act like whatever he wants and all i did was overthinking. \n\nand you know what? it made him so happy in the moment, he eventually started to smile again. \n\nwe were good for a few weeks. then i exploded. i sweared and yelled and we had our worst fight. he told all of these to Julia, he trusted her since she is the best emotional supporter friend and he asked her help like \"what should i do to fix this?\" \n\nthen Julia went to his bf Carl, told her everything my bf said aaaand i am too toxic and even sick so i shouldn't be talking to any of them. Carl yelled at me \"you are talking about my best friend of years and my girlfriend, are you insane?\" \n\nhe felt inconfident when he saw things as i did and he understood what Julia was doing. \n\nMy bf protected me all along, he stood beside me. And disgusted by Julia, he is no longer trust her. But he doesnt wanna lose Carl. I too want their friendship last. \n\nSince Carl's not gonna break up with Julia, i dont know what should we do?\n\nTLDR; i was feeling uncomfortable about this girl and i told my bf about it, everything ruined when he told it to his girl bestfriend",

We used to live together, and we had the most amazing relationship in the world. And eventually we got engaged. Getting accepted to my current school and program was a dream come true for me! To attend the PhD program I had to move out and we are now doing long distance. Although he never wanted me to move out, he was very supportive and cool. Now he lives 7-8 hours away from me. We still visit each other at least once a month, and spend the holidays together. But I miss him so much, living alone and these stressful and difficult school times makes me wanna go back to living with him again, (which is my plan anyway eventually after graduation: I can’t imagine 3/4 more years of living apart). I am also an F1 international student, so there’s additional complications. But I know if I try, I still have a chance to change school and move back with him. But will cost me 2 years if my life. Because I have to start everything all over again. (I highly doubt transferring is an option). Now I can’t decide. I am afraid, if I give up on what used to be the biggest dream of my life, looking back I would regret, but at the same time, I miss him so much that it’s really hard for both of us to be apart anymore! It’s driving us crazy! What should I do?\n\nTLDR; I was very happy living alone doing my thing before I was with him. But the time we spent together spoiled me so much that it’s become extremely difficult for me to live alone anymore. I wish there’s a way to love/ desire him a little less than I do.",

Today we woke up together, got a bit intimate, then as I was driving her home, I go in for a kiss and she redirects it to her cheek saying she feels groggy and think it might be a herpes relapse. Then, I notice a spot on her chin (I haven’t ever seen herpes outbreak from her or anyone despite 1 year together) and I realize I have been exposed. I know many people in the us have herpes and it’s not a serious disease, but I am a veterinarian so I have to maintain a good mask free face image for business, and my parents don’t like and judge her.

I didn’t notice anything this morning but it’s only been 3 hours since our activities and even though we didn’t kiss much, we still did and I very well could be exposed",

        "text": "I’ve been dating my gf for a year now but these last few weeks I haven’t been feeling the same as before. When we first started seeing each other her parents didn’t approve because of judgments they made about me. (To this day they haven’t met me). Her parents were super controlling in her life in basically every aspect of living. They paid for all things like rent and apartment even though she lives on her own away from home. So they gave her an ultimatum of dating me or losing everything they help her with even going as far as to take furniture they payed for from her apartment, her phone and car. So life for her has been stressful but I’ve been there for support the whole way. Of course I do blame myself for her situation even though everyone tells me it’s not my fault I still feel like it sometimes. A few weeks ago something came up that was gonna be expensive for her and it stressed her out a lot and she was kinda mean to me that night. She told me that night that I “wasn’t worth it” for how she missed how much her parents would pay for and when I asked if she wanted to break up she said “I don’t know” then didn’t talk to me until apologizing in the morning. The next evening we talked and she doubled down on me being not worth it and was kinda half listening to me. Ever since that night I haven’t felt the same about her and have been hurt. I told her how I felt the other night and how if I’m not worth it then what’s the point? We talked it out it ended with her saying “I’ve apologized but now it’s up to you to get past it” which is true I do want to get past it but she kinda makes it seem like I shouldn’t still be hung up on it. So am I holding onto it for no good reason or do I have the right reason to still be hurt?\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: my gf said I wasn’t worth it and never apologized for it and I’m still hurt by it even though she said it’s up to me to get past it now that she apologized a few days ago.",

I have had both a step-mother and a step-father so I know these kind of relationships can get bad easily, so I tried to do my best. I played with her, listened to her whenever she wanted to talk, helped if she needed help and I didn't set any rule but made sure she followed Rose's rules. In the past 6 years, we bonded.\n\nSomething happened yesterday: she aced a math test (the only full score in the whole class. Am I allowed to be proud of her? I will be anyway). I wanted to reward her and she wanted an ice cream, so we went to the ice cream shop. When I give her the ice cream, she said \"thank you, dad\" and rushed back in the car. I was stunned. I didn't know how to react. She never called me dad, she normally call me by my name or nickname. She seemed to not realize she had done it so I acted normally and brought her back home and we celebrated with Rose.\n\nI don't know what I should do if she calls me dad again. I'm happy about it, don't misunderstand me. I love her as if she was my own daughter but she already has a father and they love each other a lot and I think he wouldn't like hearing her call someone else \"dad\". Should I tell her something?

        "text": "TL;DR My boyfriend rages over video games and I can't stand it anymore.  My boyfriend (22) and I (20) have been together for almost 8 months. The problem is that I have a serious problem with people who rage over video games.  I like to play for fun and I've always been around chill people.  But he always takes everything seriously and that's problematic for me.  When playing, he complains and shout a lot.\nI grew up in a home where screaming was a sign of violence and it traumatized me a lot.  I can't stand any sign of anger anymore (from anyone), even if it's not against me.  It just makes me panic.  \nOf course, I talked to him about it MANY times.  I told him that I couldn't hear him screaming anymore when he plays, at first he told me he was going to make an effort but I have the impression that it's getting worse and worse.  \nEvery time he screams, I have a horrible feeling in my body for a few seconds, like I'm devoid of stress.  I don't know how to explain it, but it's a really awful feeling.  This feeling only happens when he plays next to me. When we are calling, it doesn't scares me, it just annoys me deeply.  \nI've been particularly sensitive lately. I spent a few days at his home and every time I heard him scream because of the game, it made me stressed and I end up crying.  He asked me what was going on, I told him that I couldn't take it anymore.  The problem is that he plays in a professional team and therefore video games are his whole life.  He explains to me that he wants to accomplish his dream despite everything and that he is finally about to accomplish his goal but that if at each end of the game he sees me crying, he will never be able to achieve it.  It really makes me feel guilty.   \nHe often tells me that he needs me to support him in what he does, but it's so hard.  He tells me that I don't accept him as he is.  We almost broke up a few days ago, because I was crying again from his screaming. He just got mad. He tells me that  when he yell, he's not mad at me and that I have to understand that.  But I do know it, but it doesn't change anything..  \nI really, really love him.  But I can't support him in his project.  I would like to, but I just can't. For me now, him playing games means rage and so sadness n anger.\nYet I know he needs my support.  I want to be a best girlfriend for him but this situation is really, really upsetting me.  I used to play video games a lot but I stopped because playing with him was simply impossible, he's not having fun.  I don't want to leave him, beyond that he really takes care of me.  (He's not violent at all.) \nPlease help me, I really need kind advice. I want to fix the problem, not breaking up. Thanks for reading me.",

        "text": " My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years now. We are in a long-distance relationship for most of the year as we are both in school, but have summer (3 months) and winter break to see each other.\n\nWe really clicked with each other from the start, we have similar senses of humor, similar interests/hobbies, and similar life goals. We talk every day during the school day, and then call/play games together all evening/night. She is really great, we laugh together and get each other, and have talked a lot about our future together. When we hang out in person when we both are home, we have an amazing time together and I wouldn't trade it for the world.\n\nHowever over the last year or so, when we have an argument, she has gotten a lot more difficult to resolve things with. She has become more and more in the mindset of \"I'm right, you're wrong\", and if I disagree with her, she just tells me that I'm \"not listening\" or I'm \"defending myself\", and gets mad at me for that. She almost never apologizes for anything, and she doesn't acknowledge that she does anything wrong.\n\nAbout 85% of the time, she will get mad at me no matter the issue, and wait for me to apologize and take the blame for everything, and then make her feel better. The other 15% of the time she takes all the blame on herself and gets very sad and depressed about it.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I brought this up with her and told her that I just want her to work on not going from 0 to 100 and instead just talking about our issues and trying to acknowledge my side. I don't want her to start apologizing for everything or anything like that, I just want to be heard every once in a while. However, its been 6 months and I have brought it up multiple times and nothing really has changed.\n\nIt just sucks because almost every argument we have, it just gets so out of control and then she just gets mean and doesn't let me have a side in the issue, and then she is just mad at me for 2 days. Every time. I am a massive believer in the fact that relationships are two-way streets and both people have different perspectives that can contribute to issues, and I just want a relationship where that is recognized but most of the time it just feels like a one-way street; her opinion is always the answer.\n\nI don't really know how to feel about this. I have given her a lot of time to work on this and I have been respectful of the time that it takes to fix issues like this because it's not easy to fix it just like that. But its been 6 months and it seemingly just keeps getting worse and worse and I feel like its just building up inside of me and any day now I won't be able to take it anymore. I just absolutely hate it because she is my dream girl, we get each other so well and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. But I also can't imagine putting up with this my whole life.\n\nIs there something else I can try to help her with fixing this or are these red flags that I am failing to realize?\n\nTLDR: My dream girl has been having a hard time owning up to her mistakes and realizing that our relationship is a two-way street and it's slowly driving me crazy, but she is really amazing and I do not want to end things with her so just unsure of what to do.",

        "text": "\ni recently got with my bf and i’ve been spending a lot of time with him. i currently live at home with my parents, i work for my dad on my own time, and i go to college so i have a lot of free time that i spend with my bf. my bf also lives with his parents and works for ups from 5am-9am. in the past two weeks i’ve gone to see him everyday. when i go to his house we usually either watch tv or get on the game together. this is obviously unproductive. sometimes i go to watch him play basketball, we hang out with his family, or we go to a party on the weekend but for a the most part we don’t do much. i’m not particularly upset about doing nothing but when i think about it i do realize i used to be way more productive with my ex than i am with my current bf. i also have my parents in my ear telling me my bf is a loser bc he’s lazy and promotes my laziness as well, so i asked my mom what she would like me to do about it and she said be more productive. at the end of the month i am going back to work at a previous place of employment so i figured that would make me more productive, and i show livestock in the summer which will also take up my time. however, i really like spending time with my bf even if it is doing nothing. i’m a little worried though that i feel this way because i have obsessive traits. i feel like last year when i was in high school i was constantly doing things because i was involved in the FFA as an officer and i was the barn manager at my schools barn and i loved being busy. now that i’m in college and i don’t have these things anymore i felt bored and hated that i had nothing to do. now that i hang out with my bf i’m not bored anymore, but when i was with my ex last year if we were watching tv i would be bored. i find myself constantly wanting to be with my bf, but it’s obviously making me unproductive so how do i overcome this? \n\nalso, my parents don’t like my bf. it sucks because i tell my mom everything but i can’t talk to her about my bf anymore because she always says something negative that makes me feel like i’m ruining my life by being with him. he has met my parents a few times but he didn’t make the best impression on them. he made a comment about how he was kicked out of a bar among other things and my dad definitely didn’t want to hear that. my dad thinks he is one of those guys that goes to bars all the time and he doesn’t respect those kinds of guys. he also said he was coughing bc he smokes in front of my mom, which my mom knows him and i smoke but she was just like what is up with this kid he has no filter. then he recently got a dui and my mom feels bad for him bc that’s unfortunate but my dad found out and that proves his point more. my mom says i hope you’re not planning on being with this guy for a while because he isn’t making any moves on moving out of his parents house or trying to find a full time job. that kind of hurts my feelings because i like him a lot. i understand their concerns but at the same time i find it hurtful that they really don’t like him and think i’m making a mistake by investing so much time into him. how can i explain that to my mom?\n\ntl;dr i’m lazy when i’m with my bf and i spend a lot of time with him, but i find myself not recognizing this as an issue (maybe because of obsessive traits). my parents aren’t fond of him because of his characteristics and lifestyle, and it hurts my feelings that my mom is always negative about him even if i’m happy with him. \ni want to know if anyone has any advice on how to help fix either of these issues.",

Sorry I’m just very annoyed because for one I wasn’t talking to her, I was talking to my gf and for two Im just not in the damn mood and for three who even feels comfortable to act that way? It’s rude and distasteful. My gf says she’s just being a jerk. Okay and I’m just going to get off the phone then. None of my family would even jump on my phone and do that if my gf is talking to me. Mind you we are long distant right now so why would you even say something like that??? Even if it turns out that she’s joking, I don’t get the humor and I’m just not in the mood right now. \n\nDo you think I’m going overboard or too sensitive? I got off the phone with my gf because I am not in the right head space to be around that energy right now. I have some stuff going on mentally and my nervous system is just all jacked up right now so I know what I can and can’t be around and I don’t want to be rude or stoop to her level. \n\nTLDR: Long story short I first met my gf online and she was staying with her sister when we first met. She is so obnoxious since day one and my gf only says “that’s just how she is” I stayed quiet for the most part and sometimes I would just laugh things off or say a joke but damn it’s annoying sometimes and I don’t feel like dealing with it. I end up feeling like the problem for getting annoyed. Any advice? Should I loosen up?",

        "text": "Hi everyone (and sorry in advance for the mistakes, my english isn't perfect).\n\nHere is the context : since September 2021, I am sharing a flat with 4 people including \"Sarah\" (false name), who is studying the same as me and has become a close friend. Last school year, we shared almost all of our \"social\" evenings together and up until 2-3 months ago that was still the case.\n\nImportant info: about 6 months ago, Sarah confided in me that she had just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Apparently she had been having \"strange symptoms\" for several weeks (without telling me what they were), and after several MRIs she had received this diagnosis. We didn't talk much about it because she didn't want to tell me more, but I felt at that moment that she was very affected...which is logical.\n\nIn the last few months, even though we didn't talk about it anymore, I felt that she was more and more distant. She went out less and less, and even shut herself up in her room more and more. At first I thought she was too preoccupied with her studies, but then I started to worry and one night (about 2 months ago) I asked her if everything was okay. She just told me \"you're right, I'm not okay but I don't want to talk about it\". This made me feel unsettled and worried but I respected her wishes.\n\nBut the weeks went by and I saw her more and more isolated, she hardly saw anyone anymore unless they came to our house. So I talked to her again yesterday in private in my room, asking her if I had hurt her unintentionally...telling her that I value our friendship and that I am worried about her.\n\nI didn't expect her reaction She burst into tears and told me everything. She told me that the \"weird symptoms\" in question were that she had lost control of her bladder and that apparently no treatment was working. I remembered a time when we were in the car together and she suddenly asked me if we could stop to go to the bathroom before she started crying a few seconds later, and telling me she was having \"a bad headache\".\n\nI was shocked to see her in such distress. She told me that she had lost control of her bladder that day, that I hadn't noticed because she was forced to wear diapers and that this situation made her so anxious that she didn't dare go out anymore. She is unhappy not to see anyone but going out in her condition is too stressful for her to handle. She also told me that she felt extremely guilty about avoiding me because she values our friendship, and about that at least I tried to reassure her as much as possible.\n\nShe told me she's seeing a shrink about it. I tried to reassure her, to tell her that even though we live together I never noticed anything, I suggested that we go on short trips together...but she said \"I'm too uncomfortable, I'm destroyed with shame\".\n\nI want to help her, this situation takes me to the guts, but I don't know how to go about it...I care about her and our friendship. And I feel really awkward about it, I don't know how to react without being intrusive...do you have any advice?\n\nTL;DR : my roommate/friend suffers from incontinence and it has a big impact on her social life/self-confidence. I want to help her and reassure her but I don't know how to do it in a tactful way",

I am not sure what enemies my husband and I could have made already. We keep to ourselves, and aren't loud neighbors.\n\nSo, this is either an act of pure randomness or we were targeted for some reason by a random neighbor that hates us. We are ordering a Ring doorbell, to hopefully catch the person if they do it again. The dog shit bag is currently sitting in front of my door, as this happened less than 1 hour ago. If you were me, what would be your next move and why? I was considering filing a police report but that seems a bit drastic.\n\nTL;DR- A random person threw dog shit at my door today and I am wondering what I should do next?",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I'm a 20 year old (M) college student who used to work with a much older woman (35F). I always found her attractive. In my eyes she was the the prettiest woman I've ever seen in my life (she actually looked much younger than her age).\n\nAnyways we started talking at work and we had chemistry. We pretty much liked the same things and we had great conversations. As  time went on and on, things got more intimidating. She started starring at me in a very intimadating way. She also started texting me daily and consistently. I knew that she was in a relationship with another guy and i just thought she was just being friendly.\n\nBut one day, she told me to hang out after work together. And we did. I had an amazing time with her. I honestly haven't met anyone that interesting in my life. As i was walking her home, she caught me off guard and kissed me. It was the sweetest kiss I've had ever experienced. I told her i liked her a lot and so did she. I always had in my mind that i shouldn't get into other people's relationship and i genuinely felt bad about her boyfriend. But i couldn't resist to her, it was magical. \n\nWe worked for 3 months together (basically all summer). This was honestly the best time of my life. We started dating somehow. (we kept it between us, but we started seeing each other a lot). She's the most amazing woman I've ever met, idk if her age makes me think of that. Maybe it's her maturity Thad made me fell so hard for her? I'm not sure. Anyway, the thing after summer was over, i left the job, because of college. And after this happened she somehow disappeared. She suddenly started texting me rarely and she was cold, but nothing had happened between us. I kept texting her and asking about how she was, but after some time she ghosted me.\n\nIt's been half a year since we texted each other. I honestly can't stop thinking of her. She's been living in my head 24/7, i can't concentrate on anything and most importantly in my studies. I just think of her and cry, i can't even listen to music anymore, because we had the same taste and the songs remind of her, why did she do that to me? Why she initiated the whole thing if she's was going to do that without explain anything to me. She promised me that she would keep in touch with me no matter what. And i believed her. I know the age gap is huge, but i didn't mind, that's what she said as well. I feel like i was being used.  \n\nI also bear in mind that she was cheating on her boyfriend, and i don't know if i would like to be with someone who's a cheater. I just feel so depressed and don't know how to get over her. I know some of you might say you can find other people as well, but i literally had one gorgeous girl asking me to have sex with her and i declined, because while she was talking with me, i was only thinking about her. It feels like I've developed an obsession with her and it's unhealthy. I've been with other women before, but this just felt so special to me, i can't really explain it. I feel so blank. I've been waiting for a text from her every single day, and the urge of texting her is huge, idk if she's gonna reply or not. did she just play me? I just crave of seeing her just one more time. She stigmatized me. Every other girl i meet, i subconsciously compare her to her and she's always better. I can't feel anything for other girls and it's been a long time. I'm so embarrassed of going to therapy because a woman 15 years older played me like that. \n\nTL;DR i had an affair with a much older co-worker, and when she left the job she stopped texting to me, but i can't get over her.\n\nPS: excuse me for my English, im Argentinian.",
