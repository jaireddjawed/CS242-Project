In the last year, my daughters ring light has a complete mind of its own. Yes, it has a remote, so I can't rule out some kind of interface. \nOn multiple occasions, both my wife and I have heard talking  like hearing conversations that you can't quite make out what's being said. My wife was in the basement and could hear what she described as \"her and I talking upstairs all muffled and strange sounding\" again, in these cases, t.v's phones etc have been ruled out. \nToday, my wife was standing by the back door waiting for the dogs to come back in from outside, and she swears up and down she heard me call the dogs from the next room. I wasn't home. \nAlso, back to the clunks and bangs becoming more. Recently,  for no explanation, we can reach, something is knocking things over in our upstairs bathroom. On the shelves and within the tub surround. I can't explain it. Any help with the weirdness would be greatly appreciated",

        "text": "First time on this subreddit and it already looks amazing, and I've wanted to ask something for a long time, does any body here have a special ability to see spirits or just a special ability when it comes to paranormal activity in general? Because for as long as I can remember, I've had this ability to see ghosts since I was a baby and it's been passed down in my family, my grandma had it but she didn't believe in anything involving spirits since it was demonic to her so we used to say she had it because she did even though she never said anything about it (she passed away in 2019) my mother has it, my little sister has it and so do I. \n\nMy mom used to tell me stories about our old houses that we moved out of, and  I remember a story she told a few months ago about how she remembers this little toy piano I used to have that I played with when I six but at the time the toy wasn't even turned on and so while my mom was talking to dad (also passed away in 2019) they both heard this sound that the highest key on the piano makes and they both looked at me thinking that I turned it on because at the time I wasn't even touching it, and then it happened again and this time they actually looked at the piano when the key was tapped and so my dad checked to see if the on/off switch had been pulled but it wasn't, I remember her saying, \"That shit terrified me.\" \n\nThen another story she told me was about my little sister and how every night when she was a toddler (we used to sleep in bed with our parents when we younger, we have sperate rooms now and we're both in highschool, she's a freshman and I'm a junior) that this man used to stand in the middle of our bathroom that was on the left side of the bed and just look at my mom and my little sister, it was like that for years when one night my sister saw him again and that this time a bright light appeared above him and he went straight into the ceiling and disappeared, mom told me that my sister said that he crossed over, when at the time my sis was a toddler so she didn't even know what that meant at time and yet she still managed to use it in a full sentence. \n\nI've also always seen and felt ghosts and of course some people I've told never believed me because they used to say \"Is there a ghost in here with us right now?\" In a joking tone but I'm used to it at this point. Because I know from experience that spirits aren't florescent blue and don't resemble people like they do in movies and I can't talk to them like Melinda Gordon in Ghost Whisper (although I wish I could).\n\nThey're more like black shapes that appear out of the corner of my eye and leave just before I can see them, and I've seen ghost in different houses that my mom has moved us from, so we know it's not the house that's haunted but it's us because they know we can see them so they try to get our attention sometimes and they always hang around us, I've seen some in the hallway in my house and I've seen them go past my room at night, I've seen one in the girls bathroom while I was washing my hands at one point!\n\n But I've learned that not all spirits are bad because I can feel it and my family is the same even my aunts have this ability. \n\nBecause feeling it is entirely different, you know how you get that feeling that you're being watched and you have this incredible urge to turn around because it's unsettling? \n\nWell feeling a bad sprit is like that and I'll tell you now it it's absolutely terrifying. \n\nAnd for the good ghost you won't feel a thing expect for tiny little tingling feeling so it's easy to tell the difference but the problem is I can't but my family can, I've been feeling bad spirits for a while now because they attached to my sister when my mom was praying over the house back in October and a few months after that  in January of last month both my mom AND my aunt prayed over our house because it got that bad because the bad spirits were showing up and they really liked being in my mom's closet and the bonus room we have upstairs and so after we pray over the house, we have to give the bad spirits an exit so they won't come back and we usually open the garage door and that does the trick, because the owner of this house is supposed pray of the house and get the bad ones away to escape which is my mom job when it gets bad. \n\nI've had a lot of paranormal experiences happen in my life since I was a baby and I'm seventeen now, but otherwise my house has been pretty quiet and but for me when I see ghosts from time to time I half doubt myself A LOT but I know I can see them and I they're there. \n\nAnways, I just wanted to know if there are others like me out there in some way! I've also nicknamed myself paranorman because of it and friends seem to agree because I've told them also",

        "text": "The title pretty much sums it up. For some background, our neighborhood is full of houses built probably in the 80s. They're not that old, but old enough for some to look abandoned. We don't live in the suburbs or anything. It's a very small neighborhood on top of a low hill, right next to a small forest. We live very close to each other, so late night parties are a \"no-no\" around here.\n\nYou've got the picture now, so I'll get on with it. I've only moved once, but it was at a very young age. Our old house is right next door. Because I was so young, I'm not sure if there were any occurrences before the move or not. However, I remember a bunch while I've been living here.\n\nI'll start with the more regular things. Only at night, I hear footsteps on the roof. They're very clear, quick footsteps. Almost as if someone or something is running on the roof. (My room is on the second floor, so the roof is right above me.) I decided to ask my father about this once, and my sister chimed in, saying she hears it too. I guess he didn't really have an explanation, since he didn't even respond to my question in any way other than a chuckle.\n\nAnother common thing is door handles and doors being constantly flung open and shut, up and down. I distinctively remember that our parents' room's door flung open. Not a slow creaky sound, a *swing*. The only people in the house were me and my sister, and the dogs were with my dad's wife. Sometimes our things would be misplaced, even completely missing. Maybe that's just our minds playing tricks, but it's way too frequent.\n\nHere's the interesting part, I guess. May not be as interesting as you expect. It was a some months ago. Somewhere during October. I was home alone, which isn't that unusual for me. Parents at work, sister's at practice. The house isn't exactly new, so it makes those creepy sounds you'd hate at night. Well, it was just those sounds that made me walk out of my room. The stairs lead straight to the front door, so I could see from upstairs that it was open. I yelled out for my dad or his wife, even my sister. No answer. I yelled again, still silence. Annoyed, I make my way down the stairs, only to be shocked by the fact that nobody was in the driveway. I instantly slam the door shut and begin panicking. Was there an intruder inside? A murderer? Or maybe some random homeless person? Well, the first thing my brain told me to do was run back up into my room and stay there until someone got home.\nI waited there, scared out of my mind that someone would be in the house. When my dad's wife came home only around ten minutes later, I told her about it right away. She grabbed a long kitchen knife and stared searching the house. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We checked everywhere, just you name it. The closets, attic, even the chimney. *Nothing*. I was frantically sobbing the entire search. Up to this day, everyone swears that they locked the door after themselves. I knew they did, because I always check after they leave. \n\nAnother incident, which happened way back. Somewhere in the winter. As per usual, the running sound on the roof was happening again. At this point, we'd been living in this house for almost a year. I got sick of it this time and went downstairs to sleep in my parents' room. I still heard it, it just wasn't as loud. Strangely enough, *it wasn't on the roof anymore*. The sound was slowly making its way down, to the side of the house. I freaked out, and saw my parents doing so too. They tried to calm me down as my dad went outside to check what it might be. I fell asleep before he came back, so I'm not sure what happened. I've tried asking him but he won't tell me anything. I still wonder what happened that night.\n\nI'd tell you more, but right now I'm just way too tired.\n\nI know some of this might sound like some sort of silly nightmares or things I've been imagining. I've thought it was my mind playing its tricks, since our family has a history of bad mental health altogether. My dad's wife's side, at least. If anybody has an explanation for any of this, please help me out. Have I invited some sort of spirit? Is it a demon? Or is it something completely different? I don't know, I really just wanted to get this all off my chest.",

We didn't do anything about it, honestly didn't really talk about it, which I get is weird but ig it didn't bother us too much? Also, her mom and I think her sister were downstairs, and they heard it and told us to be quieter. We told her it wasn't us and she said it was probably spirits.

Most dreams were our wonderful memories or adventures, but some of them were really sad and dark. \n\nMy last dream about him was around 3 years after his death, but this particular dream was special. It felt so real! It felt different than any other dream I’ve ever had in my life. \n\nIn my dream, I was at work and he came over. I was aware that he was dead, so I was really surprised to see him. \n\nHe said hello and he gave me a hug. It actually felt like his hug. I’ve started crying, because I knew he was dead. I was happy and confused at the same time: He looked at me and said: “I know it’s difficult, but you have to let me go. I can’t stay any longer. I love you and I will always be alive in your heart.” After that he walked out the door and I woke up sobbing. \n\nAfter this, I haven’t had any dreams about him whatsoever. \n\nIt could’ve been my brain subconsciously telling me that I have to let go, but it could have been my brother saying goodbye one last time.",

        "text": "Growing up in Jacksonville, as a kid I was living about a mile from the Timucuan Preserve/ National Park. Being that the area was known as a historical monument with Spanish forts and old naval bases, there were battles fought there, in which tons of Timucua and Spanish died essentially in my backyard… Around the time of being 6-8 years old I had night terrors met with sleep paralysis events in which I would see a human like shadow in my room, the latter only happened twice. During those two occasions, I remember seeing it emerge from the corner of my room (a nice dark corner of course), and during the first event it just stayed in place. It had no remarkable features, with the only outlining of its “body” being a darker barrier that defined a human outlining: head, torso, legs, arms, and maybe hands? However, the second time the paralysis happened, I immediately had elevated heart rate and started panicking out of fear (I most likely woke from a nightmare). I was positioned on my left side with the shadow guy facing my peripheral on the right, and this time it started walking toward me, getting in my bed, and holding me with its hand on my chest. From that, I was in a total panic attack to the point that I could hear my blood pumping from my ears. But after a while I guess I just fell asleep? I honestly don’t remember. Even with all of that, I don’t think I told my mom at the time, though now I tell her about both of those experiences all the time. She kinda just says “well maybe that did happen or it could have been a vivid nightmare??”\n\nNowadays I look back on that with a sort of mystified perspective. Growing up, our household was really stressful for a child. There was a lot of parental verbal fights on a daily basis especially with my dad being an alcoholic. No, he didn’t abuse me, at least physically, but all of that did lead to a divorce when I was 13. I haven’t talked to a therapist about this but I feel like those events were likely a product of the stress. As a bonus, whenever I talked to my dad later on he confirmed to me that he saw a squatting human figure up in the rafters while we lived there, well before he went through DTs. Rest in Peace to the man &lt;3 \n\nLet me know if y’all have any similar experiences in the North Florida/ Mayport area or anything to add.",

        "text": "I would have been about 3-5 years old at this time. I wasn't in school yet but I wasn't using diapers anymore just underwear. We lived in Arizona in the early 80's. I had my own room and my parents were in the room next to mine. It would get hot so I just slept in my underwear on my stomach. \n\nMy family was friends with our neighbor who lived in the apartment next to ours. I remember he was a cool guy who was always super nice to me and gave me candy. One time he was working in the attic and the wood was so bad up there that he fell through into our apartment once. It was a mess.\n\nNow my dad like other people in the 80's was into drinking and doing drugs. He was always good to me but he did like to go out with the fellas and party from time to time. Our neighbor also liked to party so they would usually go out together and come back late at night.\n\nIt seems my dad could handle partying a little and not going overboard but as for our family friend he wasn't so lucky. I don't know the exact story but there were two rumors how he died. One was he committed suicide from his drug addiction. And the other was he was killed during a drug deal and made to look like a suicide. Either way he was found dead near a native reservation hanging by a palm tree.\n\nBeing so young I really didn't understand what death was. My family and I went to the funeral viewing and the burial. The next week we visited his grave. I was confused as to why my candy buddy wasn't around anymore. So, I asked my parents where he was. They told me he was deep in the ground near his headstone. Being a child I started hopping up and down on his grave yelling his name and asking if he was down there. \n\nWell, my mom didn't like that very much and told me to stop. So, I did. That night was just normal and then it was time for bed. So, I am in my underwear falling asleep on my stomach. It felt like I was right about to fall asleep when I heard our family friend whisper my name. I jolted up and looked around and there was nothing. No other voices and I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. I ran into my parents room told them what happened and slept with them that night.\n\nI never again slept on my stomach in my underwear after that. I always have to have a sheet or blanket now. So that is my story. Not much of a \"ghost\" story but to this day I know it was his voice. I also never jumped on anyone's grave after that either.",

And he had NO EYES. I mean, it was just black holes where his eyes should be. Think of the mask from Scream, it was kinda like that. His mouth open like he was afraid, or maybe surprised. And it was BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. Like the sun was just hitting these empty holes. I slowed down just out of pure shock and looked back, but he was facing the other way by then. He didn't disappear suddenly or anything like that, either, but I couldn't get another good look at his face.\n\nI have NO IDEA what it could have been.

        "text": "I know that’s just kind of what most dreams are but these feel a bit more clear, though they’re hard to remember fully when I wake up. Again, dreams, I get it.\n\nHave you ever seen the movie Frequency? It’s that pretty good movie about the firefighter who starts talking to his father who died years earlier, and they’re in different years, and his father isn’t aware that he’s going to die soon. What always stuck with me about that movie is the way the world changed when the past was changed. The main character is the only one who still knows that something changed, but the other people just suddenly have different memories.\n\nThere’s a scene where the son saves his dad by telling him how he’s going to die, and it works. He then is talking to other firefighters and he says “hey my dad didn’t die in a fire” and they go “yeah, you’re right. He died from…” something else, I can’t remember. The point is that minutes earlier their memory was of his dad dying one way, then after it was prevented they remember him dying differently.\n\nAgain, pretty good movie, but what really stuck out with me about that is the idea of memories being changed or almost implanted. Dark City has an idea like this, too. The idea is basically that we experience the world in a particular way because of the memories we have of it, and the memories change as the timeline gets altered.\n\nI’m not saying this is happening. I’m saying that’s what these dreams feel like. They’re a little more vivid than usual, and I’ve been having them off and on for a few years. It feels like I can feel the memory being changed.\n\nDoes anybody else experience this sort of thing?",

        "text": "Namaste, my fellow Reddit users. I have a story to tell you, a story that will send shivers down your spine and make you question everything you thought you knew about the paranormal.\n\nYou see, I have always been fascinated by the supernatural, especially the darker side of it. I grew up listening to tales of ghosts, demons, and otherworldly beings from my grandmother, who was a firm believer in the supernatural.\n\nAs I grew older, my curiosity turned into an obsession, and I started exploring abandoned buildings, dark alleys, and cemeteries, searching for signs of the paranormal. I even started watching TV shows and movies about ghost hunting.\n\nBut my obsession soon turned into something more sinister. I became consumed by the idea of communicating with the dead, of crossing over to the other side. I started experimenting with Ouija boards and seances, always seeking that elusive connection with the afterlife.\n\nOne day, I heard about a baba (holy man) who could communicate with the dead and perform miracles. Intrigued, I decided to visit him. The baba lived in a small village, deep in the heart of the forest.\n\nAs I made my way to the village, I felt a strange energy surrounding me. It was as if the forest was alive, and it was trying to warn me of something.\n\nWhen I finally reached the village, I was greeted by the baba, who had a wild look in his eyes. He promised to show me the way to the afterlife, but warned me that the journey was not for the faint-hearted.\n\nHe led me deep into the forest, where we came across an ancient temple. The baba performed a ritual and opened a portal to the other side.\n\nAt first, I was hesitant, but then I saw it - a ghostly figure that floated just above the ground. I was terrified, but also exhilarated. I knew that I had stumbled upon something incredible.\n\nFrom that moment on, I was hooked. I spent every spare moment trying to capture ghosts on film or record their eerie whispers. And I found them, again and again, in the most unexpected places.\n\nBut my obsession soon turned into something darker. I started hearing voices in my head, and I felt a cold hand brush against my cheek. I started seeing things, shadows moving on their own and objects flying across the room.\n\nAnd then, one night, it happened. I made contact with something, something that was not of this world. It spoke to me, in a language that I couldn't understand, and I felt a chill run down my spine.\n\nThat's when I knew that I had gone too far. I had opened a door that I couldn't close, and I was in too deep to turn back now.\n\nBut I couldn't help myself. The thrill of the unknown was too strong, and I needed to know more. I started spending my nights in cemeteries and abandoned houses, trying to provoke the spirits into revealing themselves. I would shout curses and insults into the darkness, hoping to draw out a response.\n\nAnd eventually, it worked. The spirits started speaking to me, but their voices were not comforting or friendly. They were filled with anger and malice, and they demanded that I do their bidding.\n\nAt first, I resisted. I knew that I was in over my head, and I was afraid of what might happen if I gave in. But the spirits were persistent, and they started appearing to me in my dreams. They showed me visions of unspeakable horrors, and promised me power beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nI could feel the darkness closing in around me, but I couldn't stop. I was addicted to the rush, the thrill of the unknown. And then ..............",

        "text": "This is an odd story, I’d love input on what y’all believe is going on in my life but this is a weight I’ve been carrying and only let out to a few very close friends but after recent instances I feel I need more input. This started when I was about 9 years old living in a house me and my family knew was haunted, foot steps in the attic, the occasional ghostly figure turning a corner down the hall, things being misplaced and then left in the open. we lived in between an old cemetery and an old church and it was of course an old house. Ive lived in texas my whole life for context since the only similar story’s I’ve found are old English ones and this…. Ghost? Omen? Entity? Has been following me wherever I go it seems. \n\nAt 9 years old my childhood dog passed away, he was a German Shepard and a sweet dog. He spent a lot of time with me laying next to me while I read or watched tv, well… a week or so after he passed I was in my moms room on her bed reading as I always did. My moms room was down a tile hallway that had no windows and we kept the doors closed unless we were inside the room so the hallway was always dark. And I heard his nails clacking on the tile as I was very accustomed to, he’d done it 100 times before. He stopped at the end of the hallway outside the door like always. Just his dark head poking around the corner of the door frame. he was very very well behaved and always waited on invitation to enter the room, so I glanced up from my book and patted the bed next to me without thinking, out if instinct. And went back to my book, then I realized he’d died, I looked up and nothing was there, I also realized I hadn’t heard the taps of his nails walking away. Spooked of course I left the room. But this is where things become odd and I didn’t notice this correlation for years, one of my very good friends father passed away that night in his sleep from a heart attack. \n\nNow we fast forward a few years till I’m about 12 living in Wimbely Texas, my then best friend was over at my house one night hanging out, we were sitting on my back porch watching the fireflies pulsing in the woods when she tapped me getting my attention and she pointed asking if I saw what she was seeing and sure enough I did. About 20 feet into the tree line there was a dark dog like figure about the size of a husky but all black, trotting past looking at us. Oddly stunning to look at we just watched it pass by. We continued to hang out and when it was time to go she asked if I wanted to go with her family to the water park like I had before and I declined I was planning on gaming that night and the following day when the water park trip was happening. I was woken up the next morning by my mom informing me my best friend passed away that morning in a horrible car accident. That death really rocked my world, my first time losing a friend or anyone I knew well. \n\nFast forward 3 more years I’m 15 my older brother was in the army, and he came home some weekends and we shared a room. I fell asleep and dreamed of the dog walking past the foot of my bed and sat next to my brothers empty bed, the next week he totaled his car in a dui accident, the police on scene said if he was an inch taller his roof would’ve scalped him if not decapitate. Then 3 more years later I’m 18 my brother is out of the military getting back in his feet living with us. And I have similar dream this time coming out of our bathroom and my brother was in his bed. The dog just looked and panted. 3 nights later my brother had his second and final dui this time braking his spine(he’s recovered fully. The lucky idiot.) now for our most recent encounter. \n\nAn old friend of mine became pregnant about a year ago. My girlfriend isn’t fond of her so we don’t keep in touch anymore. I had a dream of my girlfriend and her talking on my couch (I live in Texas still she lives out of state and has for a few years) and the dog was sitting on the ground next to her. I woke up panicked but it wasn’t until a month later I checked on her to find out she had miscarried. \n\nThe dog never seemed scary,or threatening, always calm and warm, it was a calming presence regardless of what came after it never seemed to be a threat. I’d love to hear what y’all think!",

        "text": "This post is intended to add more evidence to the real phenomena, known as attachments and possession. Since I was a child I've been interested in the occult and the universal. Whether that is a genetic, spiritual trait or due to my traumatic childhood, I'm unsure. All the same, my interest in these areas of study have only increased over the years. I've been a firm believe in the spiritual and extra terrestrial since I understood the concept of them, but nothing had prepared me for the reality of experiencing true malice in person. \n\nRecent events had lead me down a path to a direct experience with unseen hostility and aggression. To cut a long story short, I opened myself up to an attachment and two possession attempts around 3 months ago. This experience has changed me forever and has resolved any doubts I had involving unseen entities and 'spiritual' forces. I'm a pretty rational person and have always valued science and logic. So, when I say this experience shook me to the core, I mean it. It would be the equivalent of believing in sasquatch, then actually seeing one in the wild.\n\nI don't have spiritual sight at the moment, but I have tactile and olfactory sensitivity to the unseen. The entity I encountered, I would describe as a demon. It had a distinct, rotten flesh smell and caused very intense burning/stinging sensations all over my body. It attempted to control my bodily movements and was able to project a voice in my head, along with imagery of its own will. It scares me to think what it could have done to someone weaker willed and less prepared for such an encounter. To be honest, I was in possibly the worst mental and physical state I've ever been in, so that indicates to me, that these entities are weak and opportunistic. \n\nI firmly believe these entities have little direct influence on our lives, unless we invite them in or attract them through our negativity and suffering. I think the two most undoubtedly, positively correlated factors with paranormal activity, are unresolved psychological issues and substance use. Second to these, mental illness. I think the distinction between mental illness and spiritual oppression are tragically misunderstood and this is only exacerbating misdiagnosis and confusion.\n\nSolutions to spiritual warfare are not exactly a science and wont be anytime soon. This is why I believe its important to saturate this area of study with as much evidence and anecdote as possible, hence this post. In frantic desperation, my attempt to survive the ordeal *I* was faced with, was to contact a Christian friend who I thought could help. Turns out he could and I was able to exorcise the attachment through prayer and faith. I'm not religious, however belief and placebo are incredibly effective tools we can utilize to our benefit. \n\nFurthermore, advice I have received from an ex-catholic exorcist turned shaman, was to seek psychological counselling, alongside a spiritual practise such as Qigong or meditation. Mental and physical health are reliable safeguards to negative influence, both spiritual and physical.\n\nAny substantiated input on this topic is welcome.",

        "text": "This is something that happened last night. I didn’t believe this was a nosleep story. But I was hoping someone here could explain this, or share their experience with me to help me feel better. But I should also give a little context about myself. \n\nTo start, I sleep on the opposite end of the bed. Where normal people would put their feet I guess you could say. I switch it up occasionally. Sometimes I sleep on the normal end, but more often than not, my head is at the end of the bed, and my feet is where a head would go I guess you can say. It is a nightmare sometimes when my pillows fall on the ground because it's the foot of the bed, and there isn’t a reliable headboard. \n\nI don’t have a personal reason as to why I do this. But when people ask, usually I tell them it’s because I don’t like my cats sleeping near my head. They like to look out the window, especially when I keep it open, and it’s a win-win. They get to look out the window when they want, but they’re still at my feet. \n\nTo be frank, I don’t care if they sleep near my head. My brain just tells me “This isn’t normal.” So I feel like I have to come up with an excuse. But, I do this simply because I want to. No other reason than that. \n\nAt the head of my bed are two windows as I previously stated. When I lay down, I’m looking at these two windows. And directly behind me is my bedroom door.\n\nNow, I’m not a spiritual person, however I do believe in the paranormal. I’ve had a few experiences growing up. But this takes the cake. And I’m still reeling from it. \n\nWhat it was, what I could be. What’s the explanation, or most importantly to me, will it happen again?\n\nAnyways. I was getting ready for bed last night. I wasn’t particularly tired as I struggle with insomnia. But sometimes if I lay in bed long enough, I’ll fall asleep. The sleep isn’t restful, as I’ll wake up in the morning aching all over. But that’s another story.\n\nI had used the restroom, brushed my teeth, and crawled into bed. I made sure to leave my door cracked open for the cats. I have two cats, but one of mine prefers my roommate's room, and my roommate's cat prefers my room. My youngest cat sleeps on the nightstand that overlooks the window, and Hannibal (my roommate's cat.) takes the bed. \n\nI reached for my lamp, and turned it off. I put in some earbuds for the next half hour or so, and closed my eyes.\n\nEventually I get bored of music, take my earbuds out to charge my phone, (wired earbuds are better than Bluetooth no debate needed), and I see it. \n\nFour red dots at the end of my bed, right in front of me. They were lined up in a square formation. Two dots on top, and two at the bottom. \n\nI of course freaked out. But I was also curious. \n\nI looked around my room thinking it was a reflection from somewhere. I even peeked out the window for good measure. Nothing. I looked behind me thinking I left a light on, and this was the result. But still. Nothing. \n\nMy roommate was out of town this weekend, and didn’t come back until today. So it wasn’t her. \n\nThen, I’m pretty sure I saw it, blink?? \n\nThese were four red dots, barely over the size of a laser pointer. And they didn’t just flash on, then off again. It was like an eyelid slowly covered the eye, and then opened. \n\nTwo things happened.\n\nOne, my flight response was triggered but my fight response was too. It’s like I wanted to desperately run, but I wanted to figure out the cause of this first.\n\nTwo, the cats perked up. My youngest, who I had never seen bare her teeth or growl before, was in a fighting stance. Hannibal was too, but he was hissing, looking back at me, then back at the red orbs, growling. \n\nWhen this happened, I literally shivered. A clouded sense of fear rushed over me. And I felt like I was stuck in place. Like sleep paralysis. But I was able to move, and I knew that I was totally awake. \n\nThe cats were close to the red orbs. Hannibal could probably swat at them with no strain. \n\nWhen they blinked again. I realized this wasn’t some illusion or deception. This wasn’t a mirage. This was real. If the cats are reacting to it. Then it’s fucking real.\n\nThe most uncomfortable part was the fact that the things were right at my feet. On the wall underneath the window. If this was something paranormal, they could simply drag my feet, or even reach out to touch me. I’m a paranoid person by default, and when I’m alone I question every single type of movement in this house out of fear of an intruder. But this was different. \n\nThis was different because I had a plan if there was an intruder. Not a demon, ghost, or entity. \n\nSoon, a very dark presence flooded over me. I felt it in my soul, and a scream burned my throat as I tried not to react too dramatically. \n\nI eventually slowly reached for my phone, asked Siri to turn on my flashlight. She obliged, and I shined it directly towards the red dots. \n\nThey were gone. \n\nIt was like the cats were taken out of a trance, as right when I did this, they immediately relaxed and looked at me with confusion. I had no answers for them, or myself.\n\nMy youngest ended up sleeping on my chest. And Hannibal left the room in a rush. He won’t come back in. \n\nTo whoever that is, or whatever that was. I hope I never experience that again. \n\nI didn’t sleep last night. Probably won’t tonight either. But I know that from now on, I’m sleeping with the light on.",

There wasn’t any distinct features i could make out besides it being a girl, so when my grandma wasn’t looking i decided to sneak up the stairs thinking maybe it was one of the girls but remembered they were all gone.

This story has a lot more detail than what I chose to post, but am keeping private because it is more personal and identifying information. \n\n\nTo make a long story short, my older sister used to date a guy that for anonymity I will call PJ. PJ was kind of eccentric, but he and my sister would FaceTime every so often. \n\n\nOn a few nights in a row, my sister stayed in my room as we watched her ex lose consciousness and his voice would change as someone claiming to be “Yakub” from the beliefs of the Nation of Islam (my sister and I have no religious background and had no connections to Islam). \n\n\nHesitant to believe, I fact-checked him with everything I could find on the internet and he came back at me with more.

This story has a lot more detail than what I chose to post, but am keeping private because it is more personal and identifying information. To make a long story short, my older sister used to date a guy that for anonymity I will call PJ. PJ was kind of eccentric, but he and my sister would FaceTime every so often. On a few nights in a row, my sister stayed in my room as we watched her ex lose consciousness and his voice would change as someone claiming to be “Yakub” from the beliefs of the Nation of Islam (my sister and I have no religious background and had no connections to Islam). Hesitant to believe, I fact-checked him with everything I could find on the internet and he came back at me with more. He also claimed that PJ was his son that he was watching over, and even told us some little known details about our great grandfather whom we had little to no information on at the time (he had died while we were still young).

There was a section of wall in between the two rooms. \n\nOne day, I went running down the hall to my room, and I saw a face on the wall. It wasn’t like I turned quick and saw something that looked like a face. I was running straight, looking up, and saw a face materialize on the wall.\n\nThe face had thick Aviator style glasses, curly hair on the sides, and a cracked smile but no visible teeth.\n\nI ran back to my Mom screaming about a face and described what I saw. She pulled out a picture of my Nana and Great Grandfather and asked if that was him. All I could do was nod. \n\nI kept trying to tell myself I made it up, but I had never seen a picture of him before that day.",

He was staring me through the balcony door, didnt think much of it, just scared him away. Today I finish working out, come to my rome. And as im plugging in my charger behind the desk I see something very black, my first thought is that it was a shirt I had lost but it moved. I get up and open my door so it can get down the stairs, it does so in less than a second. I go down and wake up my mom to help me find it and get it out of the house. We had trouble finding it and as we are talking my mom looks to the stairs and the cat is staring her dead in the eyes. Bro when she started screaming she woke up the entire neighborhood. Then we grabed her and put her out. Just wandering if this means something and if yes what could it mean. Maybe its just a hugry stray animal case but hey who knows? If he shows up again Ill keep you updated(oh yeah its a he, confirmed it via balls)",

It never gets old though, and I think it would fit in here. \n\nAt the time of this story, I’m a precocious 3 year old girl with as much perception of others as any normal 3 year old (which is none), and who loves Disney and books, but because I’m on the autism spectrum, people think I’m not actually reading the book, but that I’m mimicking my peers who are reading/learning to read, and I don’t actually understand the plot of the book or anything about it (which was not true, but that’s a whole other story). But at the time, it doesn’t help that my favorite thing to say is “I don’t know!”\n\nMom: What book are you reading?\nMe: I don’t know! \n\nDad: What is this book about? \nMe: I don’t know! \n\nTeacher: What color is Clifford the Big Red Dog? \nMe: I don’t know! \n\nThat year, 1994, is very eventful because my mom is pregnant, my paternal grandmother dies, and we move from our suburban home in small town America into an old farmhouse just outside of town. As July ends, my mom gives birth to my little brother, and I’m excited to have a younger sibling, but the novelty wears off because unlike my other baby dolls, he doesn’t stop crying and I occasionally have to help change his diaper. \n\nShortly after they both came home from the hospital, probably in September or October, my mom put my brother on the couch, wrapped up in a blanket (like a little burrito). I was also on the couch, reading a book. \n\nShe leaves us alone for a maximum of maybe 5 minutes (use the bathroom or answer the phone, I don’t remember), and when she comes back, my brother is lying on the floor, still wrapped up like a burrito in his little baby blanket, but with a little look of shock on his face, and I’m still on the couch reading my book. \n\nShe then asks me “How did your brother get on the floor?!” \n\nAnd I answer “I don’t know!” \n\nHe didn’t roll off, and he didn’t fall off. It was like he was picked up and set down at the foot of the couch. \n\nAnd she can’t get another word out of me. In my defense, I don’t know (or remember for that matter), but it makes for a great story.",

I was sitting alone in the foyer, just looking out the window. I turn my head away for a second and when I look back, I see the silhouette of  something walking up the road, towards my house, silently. It looked like a person, but the proportions were just wrong. It had long lanky legs that bent in ways they shouldn’t have. Its arms dangled down below its knees and its neck was nearly nonexistent, with a fat doughy head on top. I was never a kid who would get nervous about strangers, but for some reason just the sight of this thing washed a wave of terror over me. I just dropped like a sack of potatoes on the floor. I couldn’t move, nor did I want to. I just laid there for what felt like hours, but in reality it had only been maybe 3 minutes. When I looked up the figure was gone. I never knew what I saw that night, nor did I tell anyone, but I get sweaty hands whenever I think about it. Any idea what it could possibly be? I’m out of ideas.",

        "text": "This is a true account of what has been happening to my family I only changed my daughter's name..  \n\nDecember 3rd 2022 It was around 10pm my daughter was asleep on the sofa I took her up to bed she was sleepwalking and she said \"stop it dad!\" I said \"I haven't done anything Kelly\" and I laughed she stopped in her tracks and had an odd bent forward posture with her arms stretched down to her sides with her fingers spread out and said \"I'm not. Kelly\" but in an odd old woman's voice with a deliberate pause before she said her name.  \"of course your Kelly silly\" I replied and laughed she then carried on walking half asleep to her bedroom. \n\nshe got into bed and closed her eyes I kissed her on her head and I said \"love you Kelly\" she started to fidget in her bed and with her eyes still closed and announced  \"I said... I am not, Kelly!\" The same old woman's voice and pause before her name and also now a bit of irritation in her voice \n\nThen I realised this wasn't my daughter mimicking someone this was someone else. I then got goose pimples up and down my arms and said with a little stutter in my voice \"if your not Kelly, then who are you then??\" My daughter then opened her eyes lifted her head and adjusted herself togrt eye to eye with me and stared intensely with these matt black eyes no colour. Then put herself back on her pillow and shut her eyes and went back to sleep.\n\n\nI then woke her up and it was like I had awoken her from a deep deep slumber, I said \"Kelly are you ok?\" She says yes dad why did you wake me I said \"oh nothing just checking your ok\" and then asked her to pray with me which she did with no issues maybe a little confusion. Then I kissed her on the head said I loved you and left her to her slumber.\n\nThe next day I had to drop a parcel to my neighbours next door a father, brother and sister and I asked how they were because there mother had died in the summer and I said do you feel like your mum is about at all? \n\nand the daughter said oh yes they feel her presence a lot and that they also had seen a ghost out on the fields in front of our house of a young girl 6 years old who had died on a playing area that used to be there. she then told me that she and her mother used to regularly use a Ouija board to contact the dead and had done this many times speaking to the little girl and a friend of the family who had died and was still visiting them in spirit form moving through there rooms at night to check on them! \n\n\nI replied I don't mess with the Ouija it's a  bad thing and then said my goodbyes to them, it left a sick feeling in my stomach.\n\n\nTwo days later I was going to bed for an early shift at work I went to bed at 11pm went straight to sleep suddenly I awoke but I had my eyes shut and In my head I heard myself say \"theres somebody in the room!\" I opened my eyes and in the dark I could see a man with white hair and black glasses working on a device pressing it into where my wifes side of the bed is, I jump back shocked and I started to get out of bed I turned my head away and when I looked back he was gone! It was a real person totally solid and real to look at.. I wasn't scared at that time just bewildered ..\n\n\nI went back to sleep some how and then again it happens I'm suddenly awake with my eyes closed and once again my mind is telling me someone is in the room! I open my eyes and this time it's more sinister, to my right at the side of the bed where my wife's sleeps there is a creature with matt black eyes staring at me (the eyes reminded me of how my daughter's looked a few days before) it was like a mixture of a gargoyle and a gremlin with no wings and long pointed ears that point straight up, nostrils like a gorillas it's skin was dark green and leathery with light orangey brown strips going down it's arms it was looking straight at me with a mouth that seemed to be frothing on one side and it looked very old, exhausted and very hungry and was slowly panting while looking in my direction. \n\nI slowly got out of bed not taking my eyes off if it and walked round the bed towards it and noticed it had very long arms with 5 clawed fingers on each hand and it had the same bent forward posture my daughter had had earlier in the week with the arms hanging down to its sides. I walked towards it and  then it disappeared from the room.\n\n\nWell I was scared then but I slept ok the next two weeks were fine but from late December 2022 into now February 2023 I'm having real trouble sleeping I feel I'm like I'm being watched but also I feel an icy cold wind blows on my neck and round my spine and knees but my wife and the rest of the family are fine just me\n\n really cold in areas of my body round my neck, knees and face especially between my eyes and nose. I will have a good day every 3-4 days and 2 hours sleep each day the next few days.\n\n\nI have seen a doctor and had Urine and blood tests they have come back fine, I have been given sleeping tablets and I have been taking calming tablets they do help but it's still happening I'm  getting cold and sometimes feel something is there. \n\nI also saw a vicar and had myself blessed and also a crucifix and  holy Bible blessed as well and I went around the house saying the lord's prayer and then telling it to leave by the power of God and Jesus Christ. That did help for one day the house got very positive and light and I slept really well but the next day I had a terrible sleep again.. \n\nI don't know what to do very disturbing for me but to other people it just will seem like a bad horror film but it feels real to me and they're have been other small things starting to happen which even my other family members have noticed.\n\nAny way thanks for reading.",

        "text": "When I was ages 9-11ish, my family and their friends would rent out a different home every summer in the Poconos. Most of her friends and those who had kids would come by every weekend to swim, fish, and party, and during the week whoever took off from work would stay there. My mother took off 1 or 2 weeks from work and it was just us two at the home during the week. We were in bed talking as we usually did before going to sleep, when we heard footsteps and movement downstairs. My mom immediately shushed me to get a better hearing of what was happening. I didn’t immediately get alarmed by it but I remember asking why? My mom again said SHHH with sense of urgency and fear that made me instantly nervous. I knew we were there alone and realized that someone else was downstairs. These footsteps were very loud and not trying to be quiet, after a minute or so we heard them approaching the stairs. Once my mom realized these noises were in fact happening she snapped into action and quietly ushered me out of bed. She started to open the window (we were on the 2nd floor bedroom with a flat roof directly outside our window.) At this same time the footsteps started to loudly climb up the stairs. I was so scared and my mother was telling me to climb out the window (in her mind these were robbers or intruders that might want to cause us harm) I kept refusing but slowly started to approach the window about to go out when the heavy footsteps reached the top of the stairs, I remember every step with us getting more frightened. We heard it right outside our bedroom and then they completely stopped and it was all very quiet again. We froze not making a sound for what felt like forever but was probably like a few minutes, our hearts beating so fast. My mom eventually opened the door and there wasn’t anyone there. She eventually checked the whole house including downstairs and nothing was disturbed and it was completely empty like nothing ever happened. It was a very strange experience that I still remember to this day and whenever I bring it up to her she’s like yeah idk what happened but maybe spirits could be real… another weird thing I found in that house while exploring with other kids was one of the closets downstairs had an extra little door in it. We opened it and it was another crawl space sized closet with a pillow and blanket there.. Looking back I wonder if we disturbed anyone.",

        "text": "I studied sleep and dreaming any chance I got while in school, so I understand that a lot of what happens in REM sleep is just your brain sorting through data. I also know that we know almost nothing about dreaming, and that it is often more than that. \n\nMy dreams really started changing when I started using DMT occasionally, which to me, is a drug that knocks on the door of everything outside of our 3D world and says, \"Hey, I'm here. Can I come in?\" I experienced one segment of a long trip as if my astral body was being hijacked to go visit other families and embrace them. It was completely benevolent and I felt protected, but there came a point where whatever was in charge was having to pry people off of me to end the process. \n\nSo now, every now and then, especially around a quarter moon, my dreams dip into a darker area. I'll feel something incredibly electric running through my entire body and it feels, given the dream context, like something is trying to possess me. It gets to the point where I'm trying to cry out in my sleep and I'll even wake myself up from muffled screaming. Last night it was more like being pulled into a trance of voices. And it was a feeling dream me did NOT like or want, but I would get pulled in like a strong current and then be told what to do. There was this reckoning with it like, \"This is the price you have to pay if you're going to dabble with such other worldly things,\" which I don't necessarily believe in waking life. \n\nAnyway, any guidance on this would be accepted. I think I'm a little beyond, \"Where a protective oil at night,\" though.",

It was really dark but i took some pictures of the trees with night mode on my camera. And then I put my phone down and looked back out and there was suddenly this weird tall, skinny white/flash man-like creature perched up on a rotten log. It had no eyes but was facing me. Its arms were super long, in front of its body, while it crouched down. I obviously didn't stay long enough to look at what it might be, and it was really dark. I rolled up my car window and immediately left and didnt get out of my car. Any idea what it was? It was like 50 miles from forks in the direction of the hoh rainforest, in the darkest part of the forest.",

        "text": "I'm 62, and first noticed my tendency to cause wrist watches to stop working and electromechanical devices to malfunction fifty years ago. This always and only happens when I'm extremely stressed, extremely angry, or grieving. During these times, I'll cause appliances to short circuit and light bulbs to blow when turning them on and off. If I'm driving or out walking in this disturbed state, street lights will go off as I approach and come back on once they're behind me. Once, after an intense argument with my ex, I left the house, started my car, and everything on the dash began to flash. All four of the automatic windows started going up and down at different rates and I couldn't get them to stop until I took my hands off the controls and made a concerted effort to calm myself down.\n\nThis tendency has caused problems for me on a couple of jobs, where I've fouled up equipment. One employer got so annoyed by it after having to replace several light bulbs on three consecutive days, she went out and bought me rubber gloves, which she expected me to wear while at work. Friends who've observed me over the years forbid me from touching their electronics and devices. \n\nAnyway, I eventually came to the conclusion after finding others this phenomenon happens to, that I tend to hold energy in my body more than most people and it becomes uncontrolled after reaching a certain threshold when I'm emotionally charged. I'm a really tense person almost all the time and have taken sedatives continuously for the past decade. During that time, I've created no electrical disturbances. But recently, in an effort to wean off the meds, I began doing meditation sessions, learning relaxation techniques, and getting therapeutic massages. Every time I start to relax, my limbs jerk. Sometimes, my head will jerk as well. And not just small movements, they jerk unexpectedly and violently or my entire body contorts or comes up off the surface I'm lying on as if I'm beginning to have a seizure. It's very embarrassing when I'm in a group or with a practitioner. Is this the same or a related type of phenomenon? Am I expelling energy in an uncontrolled fashion?",

Partly lluz I'm a night owl who just wants to chilll and have a good time. But the other part is more complicated, I know the witching hour is starts at 3 but as I said I'm a night owl, I tend to stay up around that time or later. But tonight I thought I'd write about it. See I'm not the best person in the world. Everyone has their pros and cons. So this maybe have something to do with why I'm attracted to these things. Anyways. I was just laying down, on my phone and about to play a game when I hear a couple small thuds, now I usually don't pay attention to this sort or thing because I'm used to it but it suddenly got louder, and that's when I started listening, and it sounds like something was being dragged slomg my room wall. Now if it was a their, at the first loud sound they would've ran off. Well this didn't. And I know own a firearm. Which is why o bout the damn thing is because I thought someone is just trying to find something to steal. But whenever I go out there I see nothing, and hear nothing. And keep in mind my house isn't too long and I also have a storage shed. So trust me when I say I can look at all the buildings covering the fence. But I still don't se or hear anything. Does anyone have any thought as to why this happens? Usually it doesn't cause too much trouble but every once in a whole it will catch ny attention but like I said l. Those are stories for later, thanks guys",

        "text": "I was born in the early 90s. My parents were married in 1991 and I was born in 1992. For the first bit of my parent's marriage, they lived in a tiny apartment that needed A LOT of work. When my mom found out she was pregnant with me, finding a better home with more space moved to the top of their \"to-do\" list. \n\nMy mom was about 7 months along with me, and every house they had looked at had fallen through. Until one. THE one. \n\nIt was located out in the middle of nowhere in our little town, but that's exactly what my parents wanted. It was a two (could be three) bedroom and one bath house. It had two enclosed porches, a massive kitchen/dining area and living room. The best part was the rent was just barely over the amount my parents were paying monthly for this tiny, run-down apartment. Of course, they jumped on this offer. \n\nIt did not take long after moving in for the weirdness to start. This experience in particular, I can remember even though I was only about 3 or 4 years old.\n\nHalloween has always been a major holiday for my family.  My parents decided to host their first annual Halloween party in this house.\n\nThey had music, food, games, costume contests, and the best part: a haunted house in the garage that sat a part from the house. \n\nIt was a huge success. Tons of family and friends attended. I remember I was \"BabyBop\" from Barney that year. \n\nAfter it was over, my mom's two sisters and her middle sister's boyfriend decided to sleep over instead of making the hour long drive back home so late. \n\nMy parent's made the living room floor (which was in between my parent's room and what was considered my room) as cozy as they could. \n\nAbout 2:00am, they said their goodnights, and I followed my parents into their room to crash as I was absolutely terrified of my room. \n\nI remember waking up to the sound of someone knocking on my parent's closed bedroom door. My dad was dead to the world, so my mom got up to answer it. \n\nI heard the frantic voice of my older aunt asking where my dad was. My mom opened the bedroom door more so she could see my dad completely knocked out in the bed. \n\nMy aunt's voice became even more pleading, as she asked if they could all move into their room and sleep in the floor. My mom agreed, as my aunt swore she would explain in the morning.\n\nI remember how excited I was to see my aunt's and future uncle move their bedding in the small bedroom to sleep. It was my first sleepover in my young mind.\n\nCome morning, we would find out what exactly what happened. \n\nMy aunt said after everyone had went to bed, and the lights were out, they started hearing movement coming from my room.\n\nIt sounded like footsteps moving around the room, and then it started sounding like someone was moving stuff around.\n\nBoth my aunts and my future uncle were on alert listening to this when creepy music started playing. They realized it was the music my dollhouse would play when you pushed a special button. \n\nThey were so creeped out that they were convinced my dad was behind this, as he is notorious for playing pranks on people. \n\nThat's when my aunt ran and knocked on my parent's bedroom door to see if it was somehow his doing. When my mom showed her he was sound asleep, she said it felt like her heart stopped as she could still hear movement coming from my room on the other side of the living room. \n\nAfter this, the experiences in the house got worse, and it was a very long time before my aunts and uncle would even visit again. \n\nJust days after this, my parents said I came running to them late one evening, and I was completely inconsolable. I said in between sobs that there was a mean face glaring at me through the living room window.  This window being in the same area my family had ran from. \n\nThese are just a few experiences from that wicked house. I have plenty more I'd love to share in the future!",

I saw  him but like i mentioned it was more like a scary version of him , he looked pale  and just scary and completely ignored me like if he didn't see me . \n\nThen afterwards the sheriff came and told us Alex  had  just been in a nasty car accident and didn't make it . \n\nI am beyond terrified to go back to work .

However at a certain point I was on the road in the middle of my town, and I was 100% conscious, as it usually happens in lucid dreams, but here I was even more conscious. \n\nMy first thought was to look at the details of the asphalt, the trees, the mountains, the houses...however these were perfect, more perfect than in reality, in real life I have myopia, in the dream I could see the mountain in the distance there in my village with a clarity superior to the human.\n\n\nIn this part of the dream the interesting and strange thing begins, it is then when I think that I want to fly, because it is the first thing I try in a lucid dream, I try it the first time and it doesn't work, and a woman's voice, as if I being on some kind of \"truman show\" tells me that this shouldn't be happening and that it's dangerous for me to defy the laws of dreams, that I shouldn't be aware. So I tell her that I don't care, that I'm not afraid of him and I'll do it again, when I do it I start to fly and the details of the environment are no longer so perfect, then it begins to be seen that the whole stage seems artificially built as if it were an experience of Matrix. \n\nThat woman tells me that they are the ones in charge of building the realities of the dreams that people dream every night, that I have no idea what I'm doing by breaking that loop and consciously seeing what the creators of the reality and dreams. When I ask her why they want to control or create people's dreams, she explains that they create all people's dreams, none of them are random and everything has meaning and design and an important mission.  \n\nLater I ask her what is the objective of everything, why do they bother to build those scenarios and realities, and she tells me that it is very important that human beings are not aware of the creators or that dreams are not real but rather constructions of his, because she explains to me that thanks to those dreams that they design is our reality, it is possible that we are able to exist consciously, that if we somehow defy that, as I was doing my dream by making it lucid and making me consciously endangered existence.\n\nThis was all disturbing, because it was all with my lucid reality self and it sounded like I was really talking to an entity and creators and it wasn't something I made up in my head. \n\nI remember continuing to fly again, which was to defy that woman's word that she not violate the rules by being aware or seeing how that constructed reality really was, and then I woke up.\n\nRight after that I woke up with a feeling of euphoria, control and self-confidence, I didn't feel scared or imposed on me with the idea that someone out there will create our realities and our dreams, I strangely felt proud and powerful for having taken control of the dream and having been able to challenge a kind of creators who seem to create or manage our dreams with threads or designs, the strangest thing is that somehow I think that this woman was perhaps not only referring to our dreams, but also to the real world outside of dreams, our reality.\n\nI would have liked to tell it here the day I had it because I remembered the details of the conversation and the dream better, so I have told you the best that I could remember this incredible lucid dream.",

        "text": "Hey, what I'm about to tell you is not sleep paralysis, but I think it could be categorized under the topic of night terror or normal dreaming phenomenon. \n\nThe other day I was sleeping and woke up again in the middle of the night, however when I became aware of what was happening I had already been screaming. I found myself realizing that my mother was telling me from her room in the distance what was going on. And then I became aware that I had been screaming my mother's name out loud asking for help, I had never done that before, it seems that I was in a state between wakefulness and sleep, because I did not become aware of what had happened until she started to answer me. \n\nWhat marked me most about this experience is that I really felt that I was in danger in my room, and that there was something trying to hurt me, but I could not remember what it was, it is a sensation to feel that you have shouted or asked for help but you feel that you have not really been yourself, as if it had been someone else. Another strange thing is that I was terrified then, I wanted to answer my mother but I couldn't, I felt like I couldn't talk, (I was awake, it wasn't sleep paralysis) and I was exploding all over my room with my eyes and my door mostly with fear because I felt there was something dangerous, and I couldn't get up to talk to my mother because of that. \n\nThe next morning my mother told me that she also sensed that I was in danger and as soon as I said something she woke up very quickly.",

        "text": "I’ll try to keep this short. My mother was fighting for her life in the ICU a few weeks ago. Honestly we had run out of hope and things weren’t looking so good and she was unresponsive for days.\n\nWell one night my father and I were sleeping and at 3 am I woke up and I noticed the hallway lights were going on and off and I HEARD the switch light being turned on and off like physically. This happened almost 40 times. My first instinct was it’s a person (?) so I went and woke my father up and locked the door and whispered to my dad the situation. My father saw it too, we waited and eventually it stopped and my dad told me to sleep and he will check the light tomorrow.\n\nThe next morning we go back to see my mother and the nurse pulls me aside and tells me “we would like to run a CT scan on her head after an incident occurred last night” and I asked “what happened?”\n\nThey said “your mother woke up at around 2-3 am, and her eyes were wide open without blinking at all, she kept chanting something repeatedly almost like a prayer. This continued for an hour. We kept trying to talk to her but she was just looking straight up at the ceiling with zero eye movement just chanting away, the whole team here was concerned and didn’t understand what to do. So we would like to do another head scan”\nThey did a head scan and found absolutely nothing lol. \n\nI find it so interesting that at the same time my mother was doing all that, I had the light incident. It wasn’t a faulty light cus we tested it the next day. Plus I physically heard the light switch. My dad saw it too.\n\nI would like any insight or any feedback.. I wonder if maybe my mom was trying to communicate with me? Or all just a strange coincidence? \n\nLastly she made a miraculous recovery and is slowly doing better now.",

        "text": "After the whole door-unlocking situation, I would go over to the neighbor's house every time I was to be home alone. I just couldn't do it. \n\nFast forward to my first year of middle school, I was 11 years old, and about to turn 12, during this time. I had made a group of friends from my school and we all became super close. There was Madisyn, James, and Diana. They all insisted that when we have sleepovers, we were to go to my house as I lived right next to the beach and my house was bigger.\n\nOf course, I did not want them to come to my house as I was afraid they would see something, freak out, leave, and never come back. So for a long time, I would make up some excuse like my mom doesn't want people over, or my mom is sick maybe another time. However, I can only make up excuses for so long\n\nUltimately, I had to give in and I finally let them sleep over at my house. The first time they did, nothing really happened, or at least they never said anything to me and I didn't notice anything either. So I was thankful to my friends and thought that the entity wouldn't do anything while they were here.\n\nI was wrong, however, because the next time my friends came over, things got weird\n\nWe had this thing where we liked to play hide and seek in the dark, I know very creepy, and they wanted to play. I agreed and went to go hide along with Madisyn and Diana as James would be the one who is it. Madisyn and Diana go off to hide somewhere else in the house while I go and hide in my mother's closet. My mom had a giant picture frame that she had not put up yet and thought it was perfect to hide behind.\n\nI could hear James find Madisyn first and then find Diana, and now they were looking for me. I could hear them come into my mom's room and start giggling. \n\nJames says \"come on we can see your feet, we found you.\"\n\nI was confused because my feet weren't showing, but I went to take a peak and didn't see anyone in front of me but I could hear them in the room. They kept saying things like they could see my feet under the bed and come out because they found me. That was when I got up and left the closet and when they saw me, their faces dropped and they went pale. \n\nThey had sworn they saw my feet under the bed and when they said they could see me, the feet had moved. I tell them no, I've been in the closet this whole time, and that I could hear them talking. Instantly we all got down to look under the bed, but nothing was there. \n\nWe were freaked out. Especially Diana, who ended up going home that night. Madisyn and James stayed over but we were all silent and didn't really talk to each other that night.\n\nEven after this whole experience, they still wanted to come to my house for sleepovers. We still had some experiences but definitely not as scary as the first time with them. \n\nOur experiences mostly consisted of lights flickering on and off, hearing footsteps, and hearing the refrigerator door open and close in the middle of the night. \n\nBut that was only the experience with them. Now the experiences without them there, were...terrifying",

I thoutght to myself that my parents must have gotten home and at the same time got the odd feeling but didn't think much of it, so i said that the room is taken. The footsteps then stopped in front of me, outside the door and started to scratch it, you could hear those pointy nails cutting into the wooden door. Thankfully I was already sitting on a toilet as I literally took a shit. Frozen in fear with every hair on my body standing up, heard those heavy, fast footsteps go to another room closing the doors behind and just fading away. I went to investigate but noone was there, neither was a single scratch mark seen on the door. When I asked my family who was pranking me, after some time, they just looked at me like I was crazy. Then my grandma said I heard death and that someone will die soon. Guess she was right, as she passed away not long after.",

It had a male presence and very dominant. It was mad at me. The noise it made I'll never forget til this freaking day. It was yelling at me but it sounded like a baby mixed with a demonic growl. It lunged at my car as it screamed and me and my gf saw and heard it!!¡ \n\nI drove so fast out of there and the whole way home were in disbelief. We cried, we laughed in discomfort, we questioned wtf we saw ... It was a lot. I didn't sleep well that night. \n\nThe next day I called my gfs sister to tell her what happened. I described it and she so matter of factly said OH... that was a Lechuza.\n\nA Lechuza is said to be a witch or bad omen that brings u bad luck or wants to warn u to stay away. It wears a cloak and has a birds beak. Google does it no justice.

        "text": "This is a little bit wonky as I'm not sure which one of us actually had the experience.\n\nThe facts are these:\n\nI have a long distance partner (US/England) of seven years with whom my relationship ebbs and flows, but is constant in its well, constancy. In the last month or so we’ve fallen madly in love, again. And it’s freaking wonderful. Of note: We’ve been “sleeping together” most nights in the way that we connect on Whatsapp and leave the lines open. We can hear each other breathing, etc., stay connected.\n\nI have been very ill for over a year now and it has been getting much worse in the last few months. Such that I am in a near constant state of high anxiety or full-blown panic attacks.\n\nI have been telling my people, who are wonderful, that I feel like I am dying or that I'm going to die or I must be dying because my heart, my brain, my body can't possibly take much more of this and I'm going to have a stroke or a heart attack or a seizure or something.\n\nYesterday I had an extremely bad attack which included, in the second half of the day and into the evening, one of the worst migraines I've ever had.\n\nI was lying in bed trying to rest just before falling asleep, after having taken the dreaded steroids for the migraine, thinking about how my chest was hurting as usual and as always it seemed there was no air in the air and how I was feeling particularly bad with the extreme migraine, chest pain and myriad other symptoms.\n\nI was thinking, “I'm going to have a seizure, a stroke, a heart attack lying here; I might actually die.\n\nThis morning, my boyfriend, from across the ocean, told me, he said, “You spoke to me last night and this morning.”\n\nHe said that last night he was sleeping, but he was woken up by the sound of my voice saying his name in a questioning way as I frequently do when I'm about to ask him something. He said he heard it so clearly that it woke him up and he checked his phone thinking we must be connected.\n\nBut we weren't because I was sleeping upstairs last night as my people wanted me close, closer, as they do when I am extremely unwell.\n\nThen again this morning, he said that he was woken by my voice: he heard me say, “Hello,” in the specific way that I do when talking to him, especially on waking in the morning.\n\nHe said that again it was so clear he checked his phone.\n\nWhile he was telling me this I was of two minds: I was charmed by this man and his love for me and also creeped out because isn't that what sometimes happens when someone has died?\n\nThat is when they visit you in the small hours, pull you from your sleep, talk to you one last time.\n\nIt was unsettling because it occurred on a night when I felt like I might be dying.\n\nI don't know. It sounds a little improbable, but I feel almost like, again I don't know, maybe in the night at some point I flatlined for a few seconds there or something happened.\n\nMore likely he is just a passionate man and was worried about me, but still it was a little unsettling.",

        "text": "Now I know by the title this sounds like it will be a silly story.... I assure you it was one of the scariest things that's happened to me.\n\nI'll start from the beginning. I worked at a flea market for a few years and in 2017 is where this all began. (I live in a very tiny town so our flea market is more like a cross between storage wars and a thrift store. Everyone sells out of storage units and it's usually things they've found in yard/estate sales.) \n\nI'd been working with my uncle and brother (in laws) when I came across this golden goblet type cup with different symbols around the sides. For some reason I couldn't stop thinking about it all day and asked many questions about it. According to my uncle he had originally got in a pair and one was bought by a woman who's rumored to be our towns local witch. She'd told him she'd only needed the one, but that they're usually used in different rituals and to basically be very careful with whoever ended up with the cup.\n\nI had always been kind of interested in these things anyways and had been collecting weird spooky stuff for years. And it really didn't help that Halloween was a few months away either as I thought I could use it then to just drink out of and mess around. So I bought it. *BIG MISTAKE!* \n\nT xxxhe first night I had it I washed it and then sat it in my collection thinking how excited I was to have it. I then went about my business until I went to sleep. That's when I had a nightmare worse than any I'd ever had before. \n\nThis was what I dreamed; I'm in my body and I can see and hear what's going on, but I'm not the one controlling myself. I am making demonic sounding screams and am fighting with (beating up) my husband because he's trying to stop me from going outside and hurting other people. The screaming and the actions and the whole time in my dream mind I keep telling myself to stop because I'm scared but I can't. \n\nThe nightmare continued for weeks until it got to a point where I was scared to even be in my bedroom because I could feel a presence there. My husband felt it too and he doesn't believe in any of this either. So we started sleeping in the living room instead. The nightmare continued, but the presence wasn't there so I thought it was okay. \n\nWrong again. Days later I'm asleep on my couch while my husband was at work. I feel someone grab my arm and wake up to see a dark shadow standing over me. I panicked and began what I like to call the \"help me\" prayer... \"God help me help me help!\" It worked. But I was still very freaked out. \n\nWhen I went back to work at the flea market that weekend our local witch happened to be there. I had never met her so how she knew this astounds me but she asked about the cup. I told her about everything that had been happening. That's where she told me to dispose of the cup. Put it in a container and dump salt on it while saying a prayer and then throw it away because the cup had been used in some very intense rituals and that's what the entity was attached to.\n\nOf course me being the dumbass I am didn't actually do what she had told me and thought I could put it out in my garage until Halloween where I could use it to scare my friends. \n\nOff and on all night things went wrong. Banging on our garage door, the doorknob rattling like something was trying to come in, and the shuffling sounds of things being moved around. The next day when I got up there were boxes pulled down from shelves or opened and the stuff spread out all over the garage. But did I throw the thing away like the lady had said? Still no. \n\nInstead I called my friend to come over and check it out since she'd kinda heard about it in real time. Immediately when she came over she refused to come inside because she felt like something evil was inside. (She's a very spiritual person as well.) When I relayed to her what our local witch had said she reprimanded me for not listening and insisted I do it so we could cleanse my home and get rid of this thing for good. \n\nI grabbed a bag and shoved the cup inside and dumped nearly a whole container of salt in it. When I brought it out I asked my friend to pray with me given she grew up Catholic. So we prayed over the bag and I threw it in my outdoor trash can. My friend then said she wanted to come in and bless the house so I let her. That night I slept the best I'd slept in awhile, and haven't had anything like this happen again.",

He fell ill after his first night there.\n\nWe had a normal day, going to my grandparents house, and then we got back to my cousins' house.

You can tell there was a lot of love in these walls.\n\nSince we’ve been here, I’ve had two things happen in the bathroom at the back of the house.\n- one of our first nights here, I was brushing my hair and felt like someone grabbed the back of my shirt. Not hard, but definitely more than just a shift in the material if you know what I mean\n- last week when I got out of the shower, there was a handprint above the towel rack on the wall that hadn’t been there before and was the wrong size to be either mine or my fiance’s. I know handprints can kinda stick on walls and then show up when it gets steamy, but again, wrong size and never saw it before then\n\nI’d love to hear what people think of this! I’ve always believed in ghosts/spirits but never really had anything concrete to go on until we moved here.",

Not a long story but the comfort in knowing she was a ok was such an ease on my heart.",

        "text": "First and foremost, Hello, this is my first post to this community. I usually just read all the spooky content that winds up here, but figure I'd share some of my stories.\n\nSo my wife and I moved out to a ranch to work on each other as we were having some difficulties at the time. The place we moved into originally had a group of farmers living in it, lots of random junk laid about the property.\n\nAfter living there for 2 weeks I decided to clean up the property a little, make it look nicer. I made a fire pit to dispose all the left over garbage and what not when I stumbled across a white beheaded owl.\n\nI felt spiritually that it would be more respectful to burn the owls body than bury because there were some stray dogs that visited the property.\n\nThat same night, our lights began flickering at night every night. My wife would hear footsteps outside the house while I'd be at work but she would see no one. Then the woman appeared, she'd stand off in the darkness and sway back and forth slowly as if she was dancing, she wore a white dress and had long black hair that covered any facial features.\n\nShe'd be there every night, when I'd back the car out my lights would actually shine on her. So one day I go to where she stood but during the day to see if maybe it was an object, and there was nothing. \n\nThe area was a field of dead grass, no objects of any kind and on the ground there was a burn spot where she would stand.\n\nAfter more time passed, one of the strays attacked my dogs and the landlord stated our animals were the problem. We got fed up with the bs and left, later I heard that the dog whi attacked mine mysteriously died and the property was flooded causing full power failure to the environment.\n\nI'd attach a link but Reddit won't let me, but I believe I released her from her confines by burning the corpse  and in turn she in a way repaid the favor.",

        "text": "Okay, long post. \n\nEver since I was a little kid I have had extremely strange and terrifying nightmares. I used to lay awake and see things in my doorway. I remember several times running to my moms room crying after a nightmare, getting in her bed and asking her why there’s a man/woman standing in her closet/doorway etc. \n\nWe moved to a new house and they stopped. But I then started having shared experiences with my family. Two stand out. Once, we were all just going to sleep when we heard a huge bang from the attic. Even my skeptical step dad was spooked. We lived there for 10 years and never heard it again. It sounded like something very heavy fell. \n\nAnother time, my mother would hang a garland of Christmas ornaments outside my room on an archway. It had oversized ornaments on it. I would constantly see a little girl in the ornament standing just outside my door. I once asked my cousin if she could see it and she said yes. We even took turns standing where it would be and nothing was there to cause the reflection. \n\nWhen we bought that house we took the old wallpaper off my room in the basement and found murals of the devil dancing and drinking with nude women. I know that sounds like bullshit but this is all true. We painted over it. \n\nNow I’ve moved to another house that is more new than the others were. (First house was built in the 70s, 2nd in 1899 and current in 2018). \n\nSo just about an hour ago around 3:30 AM, I was about to fall asleep, like right on the edge of losing consciousness, when I start hearing this weird clicking/tapping sound. At that point I was still trying to wake up and make sense of what was happening. \n\nNext I heard my door open just a bit (the carpet is thick so it has to be pushed pretty hard and it is audible). I look and the door I KNOW I closed is open by about two inches. \n\nIt closes with a click. Only way to open it is to twist the knob. And I know with 100% certainty I closed it all the way. \n\nI woke up shaking and now I’m terrified to go to sleep. \n\nOther things that have been happening to me in this house:\n\n1 My friend and I were drinking when we heard a loud sound like pebbles being thrown at the wall. I looked and several pieces of my dogs food were all over the floor (no way it could have gotten there logically. My dog was sleeping, we were alone, and my dogs food is kept in a closed storage container.)\n\n2 There are two large, cracked, framed pictures sitting against the wall by the unused side of my bed, last weekend I stayed at a friends house. Came back to one completely caved in, broken glass all over the floor. The only thing that could have caused that is me throwing a pillow over there and I would have noticed when I picked it up. \n\nOne last thing I can recall right now is one night I got home from work, went to bed and saw a dark mass against my wall. I am a naturally paranoid person very aware of my surroundings and I knew the second I saw it, it wasn’t just some shadow or trick my eyes were doing. It was vaguely in the shape of a tall person. I told myself it was just a shadow from the light coming through the window or something but the next night at the same time it was gone. I haven’t seen it since. \n\nMy friend is Navajo and she thinks I need a cleansing ritual done. Wants me to go to the rez where some of her family stays. It’s like I have something following me, or attached to me and I hate it. I always feel like I’m being watched when I’m alone. \n\nI just wanted to share I guess. Anyone I tell irl will laugh it off or tell me to ignore it and stop talking about it. Has anyone else dealt with something like this??",

Good vibes which equate to good luck.

        "text": "I live in single unit building on my family's property. This area of town is said to be a hotspot for paranormal activity because of soldiers died fighting on this soil. (Take from that what you will) There is also a lot of antique furniture in this place, as they were using my apartment for storage before I moved in temporarily. Some of it has to be about 100 years old.\n\nI  have some pretty vivid dreams. In some cases I have plenty of control over them. Some I'm just  there for the ride and I improvise. There are a few things that trigger my fight or flight response and it can freak me out in-dream.  Anyways, I don't want to spend too much time writing this but I will respond to comments.\n\nI thought it was just the normal dream but it quickly became obvious it wasn't. One thing that I try not do in my dreams is look too deeply into peoples eyes. So when I was invited to sit down and play video games by a strange unknown boy with a huge grin, I didn't think to take a closer look. Well I walk into his garage that was set up like a living room. There was a woman sitting nearby who shared the same strange ear-to-ear grin that the boy had and just sat there in approval. I kept speaking to them and they wouldn't respond. Only grin. I sat down on the couch with the boy to play games when I notice, this is a Playstation 2. The kind of games that existed when I was a kid. But the TV looked like an advanced multi-panel monitor set-up, which stumped me. At which point I turn over and look at the boy and as I see the detail in his face, I notice he isn't \"real\". What I mean is, he is inanimate. It's not a boy at all it was something pretending to be a boy and mother in a garage. But why was it trying to coddle me on that couch, as to feel comfortable and content to let my guard fully down. \n\nI stopped everything at that moment and asked \"What year is it?\". It wouldn't respond and in that same moment I stood up and paced out of the garage and outside of it looked like outer space. A dark grey matter with stardust that felt like some type of barrier. I knew that it led to home so I jumped into the dark matter and flew away. It was such a strange feeling because It was almost like I had flown before and knew how. It almost felt like a swimming motion. But through air. It was a scary experience but being able to fly away makes me feel as if I am still safe and helps me not to be too paranoid about it. I just hope it's always that easy because I definitely felt the threat of an uninvited presence.",

        "text": "In November of last year, on the fourth night after my marriage I learnt that extreme terror can be felt physically; it feels like an ice cold slab on your chest and there are icy fingers running on your chest and moving towards your lower back. \n\nSome months earlier my wife to be started having strange dreams about a hairy/furry small hermaphrodite creature that spoke to her in strange tongue and she could understand this \"creature from under the earth (she somehow knew that)\". Within a week her younger sister started having same entity in her dreams telling her to do evil unclean things. These episodes subsided when they moved home. \n\nNow on the fourth night, I wake up from my sleep suddenly and I see my wife half sitting, the moment I wake up she points behind me and says, \"someone is there.\" The room being locked from inside, this sounds as if she has seen something in her sleep. I check under the bed and in every conceivable place only to find nothing. She explains the vision to me as some shape of about three to three and a half feet tall, with every shiny long black hair and a human male face wearing black robes that suggested a very thin body with narrow shoulders. She says that when she saw him it became very surprised as \"I saw surprise in his eyes and his face.\" Naturally, attributing it to some disturbing dream I persuaded her to go to sleep as it was only her imagination. \n\nThe very next night as I was sleeping I heard a loud voice coming from inside me at its own reciting some Tasbeeh. The voice began faintly but it began to gain such loudness and such a tone that I felt the roof shaking from it and I woke up with the thought in mind how could such a deep and rumbling inhuman voice be coming from inside me. When I woke up I was sitting bolt upright in my bed and my face was under the blanket, and for the first time in my life I learnt what Terror means. I felt that icy sensation running in my chest and was half paralyzed, the only thing to do was to recite the tasbeeh voluntarily in a loud but my own voice. After a while I pulled off the blanket from my face and looked in the direction of my left where my clothes drawers are and which I instinctively knew to be the direction where the \"attack\" came from. I later rushed out of the room with my wife and didn't go inside until after the sun came out. \n\nMy wife experienced identical symptoms of icy fingers running all over and also added that before I started reciting Tasbeeh I was whimpering as if I was seeing something that was causing me some great fear. I don't remember seeing anything though, and my wife kept her head inside the blankets during the whole encounter until I motioned her to join in the Tasbeeh recitation. \n\nAfter that day we have constantly been awakened by something at somewhere around 3 am and we feel some presence in the room. The terror has subsided but we both have up at the same moment and we both register some presence. We cover our face with blanket and our wills just break. Sometimes when the feeling is not very strong I take a peek outside but I don't see anyone in the room. But there are times when we awake and are terrorstruck with broken wills and in that time we turn away from the edges of the bed and completely roll ourselves in a blanket and sometimes at such times I feel someone is standing at the edge of the bed. Sometimes I also feel a very gentle tugging at the corners of our blankets and this almost drives me out of mind with terror. \n\nI don't know what is haunting us. During the day I make different resolves to confront the thing or maybe even attack it but during these nightly encounters my willpower is just sapped and all I wish at that time is to fast forward the night. \n\nIf someone has experienced similar encounter please be so kind as to shed some light on what has been happening to me. Tips to just \"kill\" this entity if possible are also welcome. I don't just want it to leave me alone, I want to actively finish this thing off so that it doesn't cause the pain and terror that it has caused me to any other person. as \n\nP.s. Has someone done black magic on me?",

        "text": "This is long but is really a true story.\n\nI was kicked out of my mother's house at 18 and went to live with my uncle and father in Selma, AL. It was an old house that belonged to my grandmother before she passed. My folks used to tell me stories when I was younger about the house, saying it was haunted and was once a slave house. Selma has a history of slavery and even was once called \"slave city,\" so I believed the stories. There was even a rumor that a witch lived in the house before my grandmother. It's also rumored that my grandmother's brother even dated a woman who was said to be a witch, and she put candles around the doorsteps with a chicken with its head cut off in the middle. \n\n I've had family members tell me about their stories of seeing and hearing paranormal activity around the house, but at this point I had never witnessed anything, so I thought they were all just superstitious and paranoid. \nAfter a while, I move into my father's old room, and he warns me that one day I'll start hearing voices. I had a dog at the time, and he even warned me that one day soon my dog would die. His exact words were more cryptic than that though.  He said, \"They'll either kill you or the dog.\"\n\nI laughed, thinking he was joking. He told me that my aunt was secretly a Witch and that i couldn't trust my uncle. He also told me that if something starts calling for you to come outside the room at strange times, it's not real. I laughed at him even more then cause I remembered other family members saying he was crazy and talked to himself sometimes. Despite his claims, everything seemed okay for a while.\n\nOne day, I was preparing to leave Selma for a job interview in Montgomery. My aunt saw me dressed up and asked where was i headed. I told my aunt, who was living there at the time too, that I was going to take a nap and was heading to Montgomery afterward for a job interview. Hours later, i walked out of the house to find that my front tire was slashed. All of a sudden, my aunt appeared out of nowhere and asked what happened. This was strange to me. She was acting unusual, but i didn't question it. Luckily, i had a spare in the back of my jeep. I fed my dog and left for Montgomery. It was dark when I came back to Selma hours later. My uncle said that my dog was dead and he didn't know what happened to it. And that they had already buried him too. \n\nI felt some type of way about my dog \"mysteriously\" dying. So I asked my aunts kids who were always outside playing what happened, and one of the kids told me that they beat the dog and kicked it in the n*ts until it stopped moving.  \n\nI had never heard this child talk like this. And he was serious about it. Didn't blink or laugh while saying this. At this point, I knew something was wrong with my folks. \n\nMy father randomly came over to the house the next day. Before I could say anything about the dog, he said, \"i told you they were gonna kill it.\" He also said that he saw my uncle talking to some Mexicans who were known for doing voodoo when he passed by late last night. Again,  I laughed it off because my father was always a joker. But deep inside, I was very worried. \n\nThe next day, as soon as i woke up, I had this weird, unrealistic feeling. Then i heard my father call my name from outside the house. He called me by a nickname that he used to call me as a kid when we first lived in my grandmother's house. I was about to go out when I remembered what he said, \"if something starts calling for you to come outside the room at strange times, it's not real.\" I paused for a few seconds, then swung the door open. No one was there. It was very early in the morning. My father was more than likely at work. \n\nTwo days later, I woke up at 3 am. Walked outside the house because I felt weird. As I walked around the outside of the house, I heard sounds like bird swooping over my head. When I looked up, I saw nothing but black shadows flying everywhere.  I looked to the sky, and the moon was so close to the earth that it might as well be a giant eye ball staring right at me.\n\nA few days after that, the people from the job interview called back and said I got the job. I was supposed to start next week.  Later that night, I felt a presence in the room with me as I tried to sleep. It felt negative, so I put my headphones in and played some positive music. Even with the music playing, the presence felt like it was getting stronger and stronger.  Somehow, my left earbud fell out of my ear, and I heard a dog/wolf growling in the room. I could even feel the vibration of the growling. \n\nLater in the week, I was preparing to leave the house so I could live with family in Montgomery for the job. I had gathered all my things and was ready to go. I sat back on the bed to get a short rest before I hit the road. All of a sudden, it sounded like something was running up to the side of the bed and then grabbed my hair and yanked it. The force literally almost pulled me off the side of the bed. \n\nI left at that moment and never been back since.",

        "text": "In the early 00's I was an outside sales rep and my best customer was a charter school. Built in 1891 as a school for \"Indians and Colored People\", it operated for more than 100 years educating thousands of children from larger cities across the nation, focusing on farming and industrial trades. On its nearly 300 acres were six buildings, including two dormitories and an old frame church. I ended up spending multiple hours on campus every week performing various functions and tasks. I loved the school and staff so much I enrolled my daughter in their first Pre-K class. \n\nVery early on, the Business Manager and I became friends and he told me what he knew of the history of the site and the Industrial school. He had been a lifelong resident of the town the school was in and knew much about it. \n\nHe also told me of \"the ghost\". Their ghost had appeared to nearly every member of the school staff, typically seen simply walking through the grounds in the early morning- and evening hours. At the time the entity was simply described as looking like an older man dressed in early 20th Century work-type clothes. \n\nMy first experience happened on the day the dedication ceremony was held prior to the charter school officially opening. Said ceremony was attended by numerous state and local officials. A dias had been erected in front of the chapel, with power for the sound system provided via a very long and thick power cable. As the chapel had no electricity run to it, the power cable had been run from the dormitory turned classroom building about 100 feet away. At the end of the cable was a monstrous black plug - think a 220 dryer or oven plug on steroids. This was plugged into a temporary power board erected behind the chapel. From there came the various extension cords run to the front of the chapel itself. \n\nAs the ceremony began, I was standing with the business manager to the side and well behind the dias. We were a few feet farther back than the rear of the chapel. From there we could see the attendees and turn our heads to see the power board. The power board was roughly 12 feet behind the middle of the chapel, the extension cords run through the building directly to the dias so as to be out of the way. \n\nAt one point there was a loud POP as one would hear when a speaker is unplugged while turned on. The microphone went out and the person speaking could just barely be heard. We both looked over to see the plug itself was out of the power board and on the ground. I turned to face him and he started to tell me to go plug it back in while he went up front to let the folks know what was going on. He didn't get to finish as in that 2-3 seconds, the power to the microphone was restored. We looked in each other's eyes in a rather \"WTF?\" moment, then turned to see the plug back into the power board. There was no one within 50 feet of it, we were the only people behind the building, and the outlet for the plug was about 3.5 feet off the ground. When I looked back at the business manager, he simply said \"there's our ghost\". \n\nThe second incident was the first time I've ever seen a ghost/entity. My company was installing the network cables for the classrooms in the main building. The design of the building was pretty straightforward - a central section with main office, nurse, cafeteria, and gym with two hallways running perpendicular to that, one on each side. The day we started was the day after all of the door locks in the building had been changed. I was helping the techs that day as we were a small company and didn't have a proper IT staff. I was friends with the school secretary and she made me promise I wouldn't lose the key she was giving me as it was not only the master key, it was the only key they had for the new locks as the locksmith hadn't dropped the rest of the keys off yet. \n\nWe went to the basement to gain access to the crawlspaces that ran under each classroom hallway. The secretary showed us to the basement door, gave me the key, then locked the door behind us so as to prevent any students from coming down to the basement. \n\nEach crawlspace was roughly 100 feet long with a single, bare lightbulb hung at the far end. The entry to the crawlspace was about 4 feet off the floor, and the crawlspace slowly tapered from a ceiling height of about 5' to just about 3' at the far end. It was maybe 4' wide, but it was tight.\n\nThe tech and I had been running cable for a couple of hours and were down the crawlspace furthest from the stairs leading down from the main level, which we could just see the bottom of from where we were.  We were just about halfway down and I was to the left of my tech, with him between me and the basement. At one point I caught movement out of the my peripheral and looked past him to the basement. \n\nWhat I saw was an older-looking white man, maybe early 60's, salt n pepper hair, wearing what I would've said were medium brown khakis and a dark green- or blue work coat. He was back just far enough from the crawlspace entrance to see him from the knees up. When I asked my buddy who that was, two things happened. First, my brain realized that I couldn't tell the exact color of the man's coat because he was transparent, and my buddy's knees buckled and he fell back into me. When he turned to look at me, his face had gone gray. I looked back and the man was gone. \n\nI maneuvered around the tech and headed up the crawlspace,.keeping the bottom of the stairs in sight the entire time. In my head I was thinking some damn kid had gotten into the basement and was screwing around. Got to the basement, dropped down to the floor to find the basement empty. The door at the top of the stairs (there were two flights of stairs as the ceiling was about 15' high and they turned halfway down so the bottom of the stairs was directly across from the hole to the crawlspace) was still locked. I opened the door to find the head custodian and the principal chatting in the hall. I asked if they had seen a student just come up and they told me no. In fact, the custodian said, he'd been cleaning up after a kid had vomited in the hall and no one had been in or out of the basement in the 30 minutes or so he'd been there. \n\nI walked to the main office and asked my secretary friend who else had a key to the basement door. She told me again, there was just the one key in the entire building and I had it. \n\nThen she grinned broadly and asked, \"Why...?\" I detailed what I'd just seen, to which she said, \"You've seen him! That's our ghost!\". Apparently he takes an interest in any changes that are being made to the buildings and just shows up to watch. \n\nIn the midst of this, the tech comes bursting through the basement door, his gear bag over his shoulder, hauling ass to the main entrance. He looks ill. I head out after him, calling his name as he raced across campus to the parking lot. He's in his truck and gone without ever acknowledging me. He told the office he drove straight home, then called out the next day. I worked closely with him for several more years. The one time I asked him what happened to him, what did he see in the basement, he looked me dead in the eyes and said, \"I'm not talking about it. Ever. So don't ask and don't involve me if you talk about it.\" He was a really nice guy, very affable, and like I said, we worked together for years. It was the only time I remember seeing him when he didn't have a smile on his face. \n\nI never experienced anything else, but over the years anyone I've run into who has spent a good deal of time at the school has experienced something. Teachers, staff, parents, coaches and the like. Having said that, I've never heard of any students experiencing anything.",

        "text": " (This is an old creepy story that my friends told me when I was in early middle school. Sorry if there are some grammar and spelling mistakes. my first language is not english.)\n\nTemuunbileg Enkhbayar was an unidentified serial killer who was active in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia during the autumn of 2000-2004. \n\nIn both criminal case files and contemporaneous journalistic accounts, the killer was referred to as the \\[REDACTED\\] or \\[REDACTED\\] in their native language. Attacks attributed to \\[REDACTED\\] typically involved young males who lived and worked in the slums of Ulaanbaatar. Their throats were cut before abdominal mutilations took place.  The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to speculation that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected and intensified in November 2002, and numerous letters were received by media outlets.\n\n   It was speculated that \\[REDACTED\\] was abused by their parents and family members, but it is not fully confirmed. The early life of the killer is still a mystery and remains an ongoing case. There are three confirmed murders by \\[REDACTED\\] , but it is unclear whether there were more.  The first victim was in 2000, a 10-year-old boy named DulguunBayar who was short and wore glasses. He was lobotomized and had his throat cut.  The second murder was in 2002, another 10-year-old boy named Davaajamts who was tall and stubby. He was tied up and had his eyes ripped out.  The last one was in the winter of 2004, a 12-year-old boy named Tsolmonsondor who was tall and skinny. His heart was surgically removed, and he was left dead in the cold Mongolian night.\n\n(This is one of my friends story)  When I was seven years old, I saw a strange man standing near my house. He was blurry, but I could see his disturbing face. I took a picture of him with a camera that my father had given me on my birthday.)\n\n can't post pictures",
