Longer/infinite lifespans, increased abilities, and an overall improvement of health just to name a few.\n\nHowever, there is also something I find deeply unsettling.\n\nI, and I'm sure many others, hold our humanity close to us, we love nature and the things that make us human, like enjoying a good meal, feeling love, sharing intimate relationships with others.\n\nFrom my perspective, it seems as if  transhumanists want to sometime abandon our humanity, our natural state, in favour of a cold hard shell, this is something that gets a hard no from me.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

        "text": "The longer time passes from an event, the more difficult it can be to remember specifics of that event. You may be able to recall most days of the previous week in detail, but a week from 5 years ago would likely be less concise. \n\nHumans don't really live long enough to \"forget\" any part of their lives. A 100 year old can still remember being 10, even if it may seem like a long way away. But what if we started living to 500 years old? What would 500 years of memory feel like to hold in your subjective consciousness, be it a brain or computer chip? Even assuming it's not a problem of technological capability, could there be an issue in the subjective experience of  memory and stream of consciousness with a multi-century lifespan? And if we go further with some brain-in-a-vat type ideas and say you're sentience will exist for 10,000 years, or a million years- would it  still be possible to remember the time from your first century of life? What would happen to your identity if you could not? \n\nI'm an absolute transhumanist and generally believe that time and technology can solve all problems, but it's definitely something I find interesting to think about.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the subjective perception of time. Having just turned 24 I'm already becoming all too aware of how much shorter a year feels subjectively than it did 15 years ago, and I've heard from older adults to expect it only getting worse. One explanation commonly given for this phenomena is that simply difference in a year relative to life lived- for a 10 year old, a year is a tenth of life; for a 50 year old, a year is only 2% of your life. So what would the passage of a year feel like at 1000 or a million years old? If such longevity where to be achieved I'd imagine we'd have progressed passed the standard biological brain, or least there would be some fusion of technology with it, would could help mitigate such issues if they occurred.\n\nJust open end thoughts really, what say all?",

It's midterms time (yay), and we have to write an essay on a topic and talk about the ethics of it. I chose transhumanism. I am basically going to go over what transhumanism is, the foundation of it, the ethics of it (should humans be able to \"play God\" and extend beyond our natural boundaries), and where it is found in media (I am a huge nerd, and I want to talk about transhumanism in things such as tv shows (like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D), video games (such as Mass Effect and Halo), and movies (like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and GATTACA). I wanted to come to this subreddit to see if anyone would be willing to help me out with things like factchecking my essay, making sure that what I am talking about is true, and just generally helping me edit my essay. If you are interested, please just leave a comment, or PM me so I can give you the link to the Google Doc. Thanks in advance! (If you have ANY questions, please feel free to comment below with them and I will be more than happy to answer them!)",

But what if in the time it takes me to finally reach the counter with the rather frustrated looking teller, that I could have lived through a 100 lifetimes of thought? \n\nThis ... bothered me, in so much as the thought of spending even a single lifetime shuffling in line waiting for my picture to be taken. But how does this effect our understanding of self and time as we contemplate the whole of the universe in the time it takes to boil an egg. \n\nI think the philosophical ramifications are gargantuan, But I would like to hear others opinions on this.   \n\n",

        "text": "I've read a lot about future humans potentially being able to \"upload\" into superior, artificial bodies, but I haven't heard many descriptions about what kind of anatomy they might have. (By the way, I'm referring to a physical body made primarily of living cells designed to function in environments humans currently live in, likely with a basically humanoid body structure. Obviously, an \"upload\" in pure virtual reality, a \"living spaceship,\" or the like would be extremely different.)\n\nWhat might eyes, ears and a nose(or the equivalents thereof) designed for maximum effectiveness (hyperspectral vision, hearing as well as a bat, smelling as well as a bear, et cetera) look like, and which parts would be better as biological versus cybernetic (though I imagine at least some parts should be cybernetic for recording)? Would the skull need to be shaped very different to fit these effectively? \n\nWhich features of human anatomy are the most inefficient and in need of replacement, and what do you think the new, upgraded forms might be like? (For instance, I'm aware that the feet, knees, and eyes are flawed and could be improved upon.)\n\nWhat functions do you think would be useful to add to human anatomy that we don't currently have (effectively or at all)? Would one of them require a new internal organ or external body feature?\n\nAssuming that a person is brought into this form from a neural connection-level brain scan (likely a destructive one, but that's all right if the information isn't lost), how do you think the new brain might be assembled with the same structures (to keep the same memories and personality as the original), and how do you think the new neurons might be changed to transmit backups of their new connective changes to a storage center (to reduce the risk of memories being permanently destroyed)?\n\nIs it particularly important that skin is only varying shades of brown(in terms of light wavelengths reflected/absorbed), or would skin colors such as blue, green, purple, and the like be equally effective? If there is specific importance to the wavelengths absorbed, which other colors would absorb the same important ones while still looking significantly different from anything humans have?\n\nWould there be uses to having a tail? I envision it as potentially a good place to put some of the larger cybernetic components, as putting something necessarily bulky in the middle of flesh could weaken the muscle, but putting it in a part of anatomy humans don't have at all would make that mostly irrelevant (no muscle can be weaker than non-existent). (The tail might function as a kind of permanent \"Swiss Army Knife,\" with whatever gizmos would be useful to have on your person all the time.)\n\nDo you think there could be room for some extra, additionally dextrous manipulator, such as Moravec's branching fractal \"bush robot\" structure? (I was imagining that potentially being at the end of a relatively flexible tail, with some kind of open-close mechanic covering it for safety when not in use, as it seems like it might be fragile or at least physically inconvenient and likely to catch on things.)\n\nHow would the human brain be able to handle things like enhanced senses and new motor functions? Would it help us adapt to those if some other functions the brain normally handles are delegated to a computer (allowing brain plasticity to replace them with the new functions)?\n\nWould it be important to give cells the ability to synthesize nutrients some organisms can make but humans need to eat? What other important features might be implemented at the cellular level?\n\nGiven the sheer data storage efficiency of DNA, would it make sense to include a DNA data storage/processing function to cells themselves? I imagine that would probably require a whole new organelle or cell type, but might it be a way to store the neural connection data on the way to transmitting it to the storage center (greatly reducing chances of neurologically meaningful \"death\").\n\nIn addition to increasing muscle mass(possibly by making most muscle cells nonreceptive to myostatin), might there be a way to make muscle cells more efficient in strength or speed?\n\nDo you think some aspects of metabolism could be controlled from an interface (by editing hormone production or the like), and what might be the uses of that?\n\nGiven all these extra functions, I imagine the mitochondria would have to work faster to maintain a normal cellular speed. While the extra energy consumption could be solved by more efficient farming, would the additional body heat from the faster metabolism become a problem, and if so, what are some ways to mitigate it?\n\nWould changes to the digestive system make sense? I know that in terms of pure energy, nutrition is very inefficient (particularly, energy cost of making food versus energy gained from said food), but energy is far from the only concern; providing material to rebuild cells and let them function normally is equally crucial.\n\nI know that, in humans, neurons and their connections degrade over time. How much would this be mitigated if the brain was periodically \"rebuilt\" with new cells in the old pattern? If this is done, what might be the maximum amount of memories a (basically) human brain would be able to usefully hold?\n\nCould neurotransmitter levels be changed directly to improve brain efficiency, and potentially overall happiness? How much change is likely safe before it's just like another drug (with the decreased productivity to match)? Would making its effects long-term rather than short-term mitigate this (similar to how painkillers are addictive but antidepressants aren't)?\n\nMight there be a way to \"standardize\" nerve pathways so a person doesn't need to relearn basic functions like walking every time they change to a new body?\n\nAssuming there isn't a literal Deus Ex Machina emerging to automatically make everything perfect/annihilated (I am pretty skeptical of the concept of the Singularity), around which century (or possibly even decade, though I doubt it given the scale of what I'm describing) do you estimate all this might become possible? What might civilization look like then?\n\nFinally, given all these questions, how do you imagine you'd possibly describe the outside appearance of a (designed to live on Earth or in a similar environment, and in a living body and not just a computer) posthuman if you saw one? (I know they'd vary a lot, but just describe your estimate of the \"normal.\") Do you think they'd appear physically attractive to a modern human(or, alternatively, how might human ideas of attractiveness affect their overall structure)?\n\nI know that this is a very long post full of very hypothetical questions (I said \"might,\" \"possibly,\" and \"could\" a whole lot of times), but I'm not really expecting fully detailed answers to every question. I'd just like to hear your thoughts on the matter and see some interesting ideas. Of course, it would be great if a real biologist gave their thoughts, but I'd like to hear what everybody on this subreddit has to say about it. Similarly, while I'd love it if someone wrote their thoughts on every question, knowing how long that would take, I'd be happy to see a reply to even one of them. Given how much I hear other transhumanists discuss the possibility of \"uploading\" to a superior body, I'd like to hear some of your thoughts on what said body might actually be like (\"superior\" isn't a very clear description). At the moment, searching \"transhumanism\" on Google Images only gets a lot of androids with humanlike face masks, and at some point I'd like to see something more realistic there.",
