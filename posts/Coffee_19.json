        "text": "I had heard so much about luwak coffee and was curious to try it for myself. For those who are unfamiliar, luwak coffee, also known as civet coffee, is made from beans that have been eaten and excreted by the civet, a small mammal found in Southeast Asia. The beans are cleaned and roasted to produce a coffee that is said to have a rich, smooth, and intense flavor profile with hints of chocolate and fruity undertones.\n\nFinally, the day arrived and I got the opportunity to try this specialty coffee. I was blown away by the flavor and aroma of this coffee! The rich and smooth taste was unlike anything I had ever tried before. The chocolate and fruity notes were prominent and added a unique depth to the coffee that I found quite delightful.\n\nWhat amazed me most about this coffee was its smoothness. It was so smooth that it was almost creamy, and it had a full-bodied taste that lingered in my mouth long after I had finished my cup. I was also struck by its unique aroma, which was sweet and fruity with hints of chocolate.\n\nOverall, I would say that my experience trying luwak coffee was a great one. It was a unique and special treat that I will never forget. If you have the opportunity to try luwak coffee, I highly recommend it! You won't be disappointed! \n\nAlso tell me your experience with it if you have ever tried it ?",

I've been mind blown...\n\nI've tried 3 different coffees now with my usual V60 technique, enjoyed the light roast  (The Roasterie - Costa Rica Don Quijote LT) much more at 15 clicks than any setting I've tried on my Ode, and the other two (a dark by \"2 Queens\" and medium espresso roast by \"The Roasterie\") were both in the same ballpark...just different. \n\nWhere this has truly shined is the finer range (~6-12 clicks) listed for espresso. That's something I know my Ode isn't designed to do, and while I don't do Espresso, it has changed my Moka Pot game 1000%. That's the one style I haven't been able to get the results I've wanted, and this grinder is killing it. I've only done cuban Cafecitos, but what I've tasted from the pot has been smooth and delicious.\n\nHighly recommend!

The scarcity of tea during the American Revolution, due to British control over shipping routes, led many Americans to switch to drinking \"liberty tea,\" made from the goldenrod plant. \n\nAfter the war, Americans returned to drinking tea, but the supply was disrupted again during the War of 1812. This resulted in a new generation of Americans who had grown up without tea and were no longer willing to tolerate the British influence over their hot beverages.\n\nCoffee, on the other hand, originated in South America and provided Americans with an alternative to tea without dependence on the British trade routes. Hence, America has become a nation primarily known for its coffee culture. However, in the American South, tea remains a popular drink, particularly in the form of iced tea.",

        "text": "So, my wife got me a Trade subscription for Christmas and I love her for buying something to satisfy my coffee obsession and I was excited to try a lot of different coffees. However, I am cancelling it after just 4 bags. I am simply not sure what the purpose of something like Trade is? Like, what are they offering? A little bit of exposure to roasteries I guess - but that's it.\n\nThe first 3 bags they sent me were some blends that were mediocre at best. The fourth was a light roast, single origin from Guatemala that, supposedly, was roasted a week before I got it. But it was the worst of the 3 bags and incredibly stale and boring.\n\nBesides some mediocre coffee that I'm questioning the freshness of they also fucked up my delivery so I was without coffee for a few days despite my subscription. Their customer service was okay, and offered me some credit which I appreciated. \n\nLastly, there bags cost \"the same\" as buying from the roasteries directly, but they only contain 310 grams instead of 340. So they make money by robbing us of 2 cups per bag. I don't like that, but they have to make money I guess. But why would we accept that? \n\nWhat have your experience been with Trade? Am I in the wrong of thinking of them as kind of leeching of nice roasteries? What is the motivation for roasteries to do business with them? Do they have a place in the market?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/10zpmv7/moka_pot_espresso_troubleshooting/",
        "text": "Hi! I'm new to brewing coffee, and just yesterday I brewed my very first cup of espresso! (well, as far as moka pot espresso goes) I was in awe at how absolutely amazing it tasted, especially for my first time. I had followed directions down to the last detail from the instruction booklets of the assets I was using, as well as an online guide, so that's probably why it went so well, lol. However, this morning, I went to brew again and I found that the final product tasted much more bitter and stale than it did yesterday. I have a few different suspicions as to why, but I'm not sure which one is the culprit. \n\n\nSo it's worth noting that yesterday when I started, EVERYTHING was brand new. The grinder, the moka pot, and even the beans (Beans were Starbucks dark roast espresso btw). I started off by pouring like half the bag into the bean hopper until it was nearly filled to the top, since that's what the instructions said to do. In hindsight, that may not have been the best idea since after I had all the grounds I needed (enough for a 6 cup moka pot), I had a huge load of beans left over, so I poured them back into the bag. Of course, that is my first suspicion as to why the coffee tasted so bitter today. I know that beans are supposed to be stored in dark, airtight bags, so it makes me wonder if they lost their flavor from being out in the open for 20-30 minutes. Is that possible? I will say that when I opened the bag today, the strong aroma that was there yesterday was much fainter. \n\n\nMy second suspicion which is less of a suspicion and more of a certainty is that there was a small amount of beans still in the hopper from yesterday that I had failed to notice while pouring the beans back into the bag. When I saw them, I kinda just went \"meh, it will be fine\" and kept them there when I poured more beans in. Obviously this is part of what went wrong, but I'm not sure if it's entirely why, or just a part why. \n\n\nMy third and final main suspicion is that when I used the moka pot today, the base smelled like stale coffee from the tiny remnants of what was left from yesterday. Of course, I had rinsed it out when I was finished, but I'm not sure if it was enough. Now let's say I didn't make any prior mistakes to this, and the coffee beans and grounds were still super fresh. Would the traces of old coffee in the moka pot affect the taste of the final product? I just want to know so I can avoid this in the future. \n\n\nOverall, those are my main ideas on what went wrong today. I'm mostly concerned about whether I ruined half my beans by keeping them out of the bag for a while, because this might mean I'll just have to buy a new bag. Even when I do that, is it okay to start filling up the grinder as little as possible in order to keep from wasting beans? The instructions say to fill it up all the way, but I'm wondering if that's just so the beans won't run out mid-grind. I know I can avoid this by using just the right amount of beans, so I don't see why it would be such a big deal. \n\n\nThank you to anyone who read this far, I totally understand if you're face palming or grinding your teeth because of how obvious and easily avoidable most of these mistakes probably are, lol. However, I appreciate your patience, and it would be a huge help if you could help me identify which of these problems are a big deal and which are minor.",

I use an Aeropress recipe that has me steep for 3 minutes, break the crust, and then plunge. It works great for very light roasts. Yeah turns out I wasn't breaking the crust properly. I was being too gentle, and whatever I did was making my coffee be extra muddy and get this weird chocolaty taste to it. TL;DR, less paddling and more stabbing. In my defense, I'm blind and couldn't actually see how the original recipe demonstrated crust breakage.\n\nI'm happy to report my coffee now tastes like honeydew and nuts with a very light hint of a roasty taste. I can actually taste the acidity coming through now! Much, much better. I had lowered my ratio to reduce that chocolaty taste. Now I can stay at 15/250 and get a good cup with good strength.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to go test my water...",

Bought myself a $30 navy blue keurig from Walmart and enjoyed the caffeine boost that got me through the day. \n\nDecided hey, let‚Äôs get an easy, cheap way to get a good cup of coffee. Bought an aeropress. Oh, I should get a grinder, so I can grind my coffee to the degree I like? Okay. $150 for a jx-pro so I can know that I‚Äôm getting a consistent, high quality grind for years to come? Okay that‚Äôs fine ig I‚Äôm chilling. Bought a food scale to measure the amount of coffee and a gooseneck kettle just to feel fancy. \n\nOrdered some dark roast beans from happy mug. Used James Hoffman‚Äôs method, and it was pretty good. Finally a coffee I don‚Äôt really mind drinking black.\n\nThen I found this aeropress technique by some astrophysicist dude that takes like 10 minutes, but claims to make a REALLY good cup of coffee. Okay dude, I‚Äôll try it. Got consistent cups that I actually REALLY like to drink. \n\nI‚Äôm starting to look forward to the process AND the taste of drinking coffee, but I don‚Äôt really want to pump myself full of caffeine throughout the day, so I order some dark roast decaf beans, so I can make coffee when I want to drink a cup, but don‚Äôt necessarily want the caffeine. Fuck it though, I order a light roast (the happy mug Rwanda natural process shit) as well just to see why people are hyping them up so much. \n\nBrewed the light roast using that astrophysicist dude method, and holy shitt. I get it now. Why people describe certain coffees as ‚Äúfruity.‚Äù I used to think coffee just tasted like coffee, and then the other coffee would just be like a slightly different version of the coffee taste, but the shit just tasted pretty much the same. Now, I get the comparison to fruit, and why some people compare lighter roast to teas, and why people are so passionate about coffee in general. \n\nNow my goal is to find a good decaf light roast (is that a thing? I hope so), so I‚Äôm not limited to a once-per-day light roast experience. I‚Äôm also going to get a V60 and French press just so I can see the differences that different brew methods make. \n\nBut yeah, I get it now.",

Unfortunately, that just kicked the bucket so I splurged on a Breville Precision and I've been really unhappy with the results. I use an Encore with M2 burrs, fresh good coffee, etc. Nothing has changed except the brewer.\n\nCoffee tastes thin, papery and a bit bitter.\n\n\nVariable| Bonavita| Breville |Chemex\n---|---|---|----\nGrind Setting| 20| 18-24 |22-24\nRatio| 1:17| 1:18 - 1:14.5 | 1:15\n\nI've tried:\n\n* \"Gold Cup\" setting\n* Several variations of \"My Brew\"\n* Pre-wetting filters\n* Flat Bottom and cone filters\n\nNot really sure what to do from here, all I can think of is grinding finer?",

That is for when I am at work.\n\nMy Melitta V Therm filter coffee machine I bought because I wake up very very early for work and did it for the convenience. Initially I thought it made good coffee. Now after buying the Aeropress it doesn't compare I don't think. I have only had it 1.5 months. Maybe it needs a good clean? Maybe I need to spend a little a bit more on a coffee machine? I am not sure.",
