        "text": "Hey there!\n\nI am graduating with my BS in EE this June.  I enjoyed my weed-out entry level physics classes well enough, but ever since I took a quantum mechanics course out of my own interest (and got a decent grade) during summer 2021, I've wanted to learn more physics.  That class made little sense to me, but was quite fascinating.  I was seriously considering pursuing a physics minor (or possibly even a double major), but then I got a hardware engineering internship opportunity I couldn't pass up, which lasted 9 months (from Jan - Sept 2022).  I wasn't in school and hence was not taking courses for two quarters.  I also realized I didn't really like the work I was doing for my internship, and when I got back last fall for my senior year, I joined a lab doing research on robotics because that's also an interest I have.  I spoke to the EE dept. advisors about getting at least a physics minor and delaying my graduation so I could have more time to explore, but due to me being ahead on my credits and such they're forcing me to graduate this June (leaving me no time to take more physics classes).\n\nAt this point, I really don't know what I should do post-graduation.  I did not apply to grad-school this past cycle because at the time I felt I didn't have the research experience necessary to get into any good programs.  I also know I don't want to pursue a generic entry-level HW/SW engineering job, based off my experience with that kind of work through my last internship.  My current plan is to try and continue the work I'm doing in my lab as a paid staff-member until I apply for grad-school and hopefully get in, but there's no guarantees there.  I like the research environment a lot more than the industry environment so far, so I know I want to pursue graduate school, but I don't quite know what I want to research on yet.  Robotics has some fascinating problems, but I feel that physics is at least definitely worth exploring more too.\n\nWhat appeals to me about physics versus EE is that physics is much more fundamental (as I'm sure you're all aware).  My EE classes and experience have left me feeling unsatisfied, because that fundamental level of theory is never touched.  We basically just remake things that already have a solution.  Even if research can be very incremental, the kinds of phenomena that physics researchers work on just sound super interesting, and taking the courses to have a background to go into physics research would be nice.  Even if physics research jobs are very hard to come by, I feel like I'll be happy having a lot of that classroom knowledge under my belt.\n\nSo right now I'm struggling to commit to a path.  I'm wondering if I should A) just fully commit to finishing my EE degree (which means finishing my capstone and taking one more easy course), doing my robotics research, and then finding a grad-program for that that sounds interesting, or B) find a way to drop my EE degree and extend my bachelors' to pursue physics instead (which is likely unwise, given how close I am to finishing an engineering degree, but I don't know what else to do).  I think it's worth mentioning that I've considered self-study, but I've noticed when I've tried to do it in the past, it's very easy for me to give up since there's no pressure on me to get anything done.\n\nTLDR; I'm almost done with an EE degree but wishing I had gotten a BS in Physics instead.  I can't do both due to my department's constraints, and want to find a way to get that coursework under my belt so I could at least be prepared to pursue research in physics if I wanted to continue down that path.  \n\nDoes anyone else here have some advice for how I could get into physics from an engineering background?  Should I finish my EE degree and then re-enroll for a physics BS?  I don't know what to do.",

If the wave travels faster, those peaks and valleys form  closer together. If it moves slower, they spread out. It’s not a poor  analogy to think of them somewhat like waves in the ocean.\n\nIt got me thinking if the post is actually wrong or I just don't understand it. The speed of sound for a given medium should be consistent afaik. Meaning that regardless of frequency and amplitude sound has the same speed. But how can a wave travel faster or slower then?\n\n**Is there a difference between the speed of sound and the speed of the sound wave / air molecules?**\n\nThanks in advance!",

In a weird way it kind of blew my mind.  I had always viewed space as a place of “floating” for a lack of a better term.  Obviously objects are moving in every direction relative to one another, but there seems to be this general pattern of falling towards heavier object, or with heavier objects towards even heavier objects.\n\nLet me try and elaborate, and excuse my novice understanding on this topic.  It seems that there’s a point at which a body falls into earth, and if far enough (like the moon), it falls towards earth a the same rate the earth falls towards the sun.  So we are never really not falling.  And everything in this solar system and the other 200 billion stars are falling towards the black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\nObviously things get a little weird on a larger and long scale with dark energy as objects seem to fall move away from each other, but at least on a smaller scale, never are we not falling.\n\nAm I accurate, or just overthinking things?  I suppose I’m just describing gravity, but it just seems more meaning for me to think that if I’m “floating” in space, I’m actually falling into this incomprehensibly large space.

You either stand or sit. There's some backup oxygen, a parachute, maybe a fuel eject in case of emergency. But basically it's a missle without a warhead. You hop in, it goes up, links with the space station in orbit, the person gets off, the pod refuels and comes back down when someone takes it down or calls it. (Ex. Space elevators in destiny 2). As for cargo, there's a company that is successfully launching cargo into orbit using a circular railgun type tech, it loops until it reaches speed and then fires out of a barrel into orbit. I feel like it might even be safer, one person, one pod, smaller object, way less fuel, no cargo to worry about. If something does go wrong, fuel eject and parachute down. If that doesn't work, at least it's one person and not a whole crew. And the whole thing could be remote controlled like the launch at the end of the martian. No need for heavy tech/computers etc. Is it possible?",

This means that life cannot be divided into fractions. Each individual organism represents a unique unit of life.\n2.

From my understanding AOA can be defined as the angle between the direction of airflow and the direction of the wings. In a room with no airflow the airflows direction can be assumed to be the same as direction of the velocity vector as stationary air will resist it's motion directly pposite to it's velocity, so angle of attack can be understood as the angle between velocity vector and the direction of the wings.\n\n\nMy doubt about this is that by this definition it means that the angle of attack doesn't change in this case as the angle between these two will be the same all the way. Is this the way it is? Can anyone help me understand how the angle of attack will change as the paper plane moves through the air?",

When the first \"metals\" emerged, the cooling of molecular clouds became more effective and the clouds became cooler.

I know that stars and black holes can be very dense, but how exactly? And do they both follow the same physical principles?\n* Is my shipment going to be hot, or could it be room temperature?\n* Similarly: is this going to be under high pressure, or could such heavy matter exist at standard pressure?\n* Bonus question if this can not be at standard pressure: is it possible that the containment vessel and the dense matter could be a one cubic centimeter cube weighing 29kg, or would that be impossible?",
