Tonight I am taking her to the local amateur astronomer group's Sky observation and she says she's really interested about astrophysics. I find all of this extremely fascinating, but what is something when the question arises that I could say to influence her or to woo her to the science way. For ex. I do not want to bring up the basics that she already probably knows, that all the planets go around the Sun or that Venus and Uranus rotation is opposite of the other planets. I also don't want to throw equations at her and lose her interest. So what is something fascinating yet can appeal to a lay-person that does not know much about astronomy or physics.  \n\nEdit: Adding that my major is astrophysics.",

        "text": "From what I understand, Einstein wasn't sure if it was static or fluid and he made his equations so they could be changed to accomodate this. \n\nWhy is it thought that gravity \"bends\" the fabric of space time? \n\nWhy can't gravity act like a \"drain\" in a sink. (Instead of water you have time. Why isn't it considered fluid? \n\nIf it was considered fluid, wouldn't that accomodate for dark matter? If the fabric of space-time is being sucked into a gravitational field wouldn't it pull on objects like gravity would? It would make it seem as though theres more gravity than there should be. \n\nIf there is more time, consequently there is also more space. It could also accomodate for the illogical expansion of the universe and how it isn't slowing down. \n\nWhy isn't time considered the cause and not the effect. (Space does not cause time but time causes space.) Nothing can exist without time. Why isn't space-time considered to behave like a 4th dimensional fluid? \n\nIf this is so, all events could simultaneously exist and we would only be able to perceive it going in one direction because we are 3 dimensional. \n\nIn quantum physics, the particles that pop in and out of existence could be particles moving in different directions in time. Anti-matter could be the matter that moves directly opposite in time than regular matter. \n\nBlack holes could be \"sucking\" the information and sending it back to the big bang, like a current. \n\nAnd studying the rotation of certain quantum particles is difficult because we can only see it in 3d when is could be a 4d object that is directly affected by 4d time. \n\nWhy would space-time switch to \"time-space\" in a black hole? Why would it switch? Is it possible we only can detect time-space because of the massive amount of gravity? Why wouldn't a planet have the same effect just on a much more negligible scale? \n\nNone, of this may make any sense, but I've been looking into it allot and no one seems to be talking about Time! It's all space and what's in it. I feel were overlooking the most important aspect of our universe. And our current model just seems wrong to me. Please enlighten me. \n",

        "text": "\n  Time\n\nIs time actually real? Time is definitely real for us, as every second passes, and the universe expands. Every passing second it grows at an alarming rate in all directions, always moving forward... However, I have been asking myself the same question over and over again, trying to make sense of the reality as well as the concept of what time might be.\nWHAT IS THE UNIT OF TIME???\nTime seems to be such a simple concept, every second tick by and you can measure the length of every process. taking the vibrations of atoms to measure the passing time as we know it.\nEvery concept we work within our daily life is quantified by time. Even Einstein's theory of relativity E=mc^2 (where C is the speed of light... in km/s).\nThe problem I have with this is do we really take into account the nature and fabric of TIME? And this is why I ask myself, what is the unit of time, a way to quantify it into a simple concept; other than time is relative to you. How we view time is dependant on the viewers' position in space like proximity to a source of gravity. Time will change its rate of flow, but not to the user, only to the-the rest of the universe, so looking with a big binocular you should see the rest of the universe in fast forward if you are close to a black hole. However, your watch will never change the speed it ticks it's seconds... Yet how would atoms see us? How fast or slow would we move to them?\n\nThis is all understandable and acceptable, but it doesn't really answer the question. what is time what is its unit because a unit should have the same universal value across the universe? So I began to think. How can I quantify time as a unit that can always be used irrespective of relativity, and this took some time for me to get to the conclusion...\nWhen space expands time flows freely, but when space contracts time slows down until it eventually stops or very close to a stop, this would be seen as the ruler of time. on the one side, you have freely expanding space (expanding universe) on the other end shrinking space (blackhole).\nWhen space expands its expansion depends on the amount of matter or more accurately the strength of gravity acting on it. This is the flow of time on the ruler.\nWhen you move closer to a black hole or contracting space-time slows down until it eventually stops, or close to it (value/infinity). time becomes zero (expansion of space = contraction of space)\nWhat might this mean? Time is the coefficient of the expanding space/contracting space. If space expands the answer is greater, meaning time flows, however the smaller the answer the slower the rate of time in that area of space. Now time can be expressed as a value and quantified into the energies of the battle between expanding space and contracting space (the unit of time becomes energy expended or WATT)...\nThis, however, might have other implications, this would imply that space expands (we know this) and space contracts (we know this) but now gravity changes a bit (Newton \"for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction\") so in this model of the universe space is a void that does not want matter in it. so it pushes back on matter and matter is energy so it wants to expand into the void (law of thermodynamics), now you have a tug of war that regulates the flow of time in the universe. The flow of energy from one system to the next. And gravity is not caused by atoms but by space pushing down on atoms, like water pushing on a balloon this could also explain gravity force between objects two objects floating on water has an attractive force between them. Almost similar to the simulation of the cannonball on the trampoline. ( I am a firm believer in the repetitive patterns of the universe, like a Mandelbulb 3D simulation ). \nNow where the big bang comes from (in this model anyway )... I imagine black holes form when space starts to fall back into itself. contracting rather than expanding into another universe, a cold spot perhaps caused by a point in space reaching absolute zero. no energy and thus no flow of time on the ruler. so it starts to move the other way. This causes it to suck in everything around it space matter, everything. Now you have growing bubble in space feeding on surrounding space-time becomes non-existent to the observer but in the black hole, there is a violent influx of matter and energy, a big bang if you will. but time doesn't exist for the falling matter in a way we can perceive it, this allows the matter to be at any place at any time.(if you could control time or ignore time, you could hold your own hand in an infinitely long chain, or web...) forming a whole new universe, being fed by energy from an unseen universe \"dark energy\"\nThe space inside trying desperately to collapse and matter wanting to expand, but as long as it feeds the space will continue to expand and space will continue to compress the matter (space = dark matter ). and so the universe grows and expands soon forming its own black holes inside the new universe. This becomes a Mandelbulb of sorts. \nEach universe a grape in a bunch of grapes, each grape containing a bunch of grapes.... to infinity?\n\nThis is by no means a scientific theory, only wanted to put it out there to collect on thoughts, to iron out any wrinkles I might have missed. and the thoughts are based on current ideas like relativity and the universe inside a black hole. but I tried to work from scratch, to try and come up with a new angle to answer some questions that the usual documentaries left me with.",

Could it not also explain why the expansion of the universe is slowing?\n\nI realize that current estimates of the universe' age probably don't allow enough time for entire galaxies to have collapsed into these super-supermassive black holes yet, but suppose we got the estimates wrong?\n\nThe black hole at the center of the Milky Way is (I believe) estimated to be 100 million times the mass of our sun.  Imagine if it contained the mass of all the stars, planets, moons, asteroids and gases in our galaxy.  That would be a huge amount of matter with an unfathomable amount of gravity.\n\nNow before you start flaming me, re-read the first sentence in the post.",
