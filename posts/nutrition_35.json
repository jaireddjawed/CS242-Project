When I researched this, I found that they believe that carrots contain an enzyme that breaks down vitamin C. Is this true?\n\nI couldn't find anything trustworthy that's either confirming or refuting this statement. If I look up in English Google, there is barely any article regarding this topic. However, if I look up using Chinese mandarin, I get flooded with articles confirming this.\n\nThe fact that carrots destroy vitamin C is a contradiction on its own, as carrots contain a lot of vitamin C. So my hypothesis is that any vegetables lose some of its vitamins if cooked, but they just wrongly related it to the carrots' enzymes.",

There is conflicting info online. Most say that large amounts of fruit is bad, others say eating large amounts of fruits will not cause any bad effects because the fiber slows down digestion. It doesn't make sense to me since the body still has to deal with a large amount of fructose while digesting the fruit. Anybody familiar with fructolysis?",

        "text": "For my second year project I had to do nutritional analysis of a chosen product. The food product that I chose was a protein bar. After conducting the analysis it was found that the product only contained about 15.6 grams of protein / 100 g product while the nutritional label claimed 35.6 grams of protein / 100 g product.\n\nThe method used for this protein analysis was the automated Kjeldahl method using Gerhardt's Kjeldahl digester and analyser. Nothing went wrong in any of the analysis steps, so I'm not sure why the results are so low compared to the protein content in the label. If it's relevant the sugar content of the product is also very high compared to the nutritional label.\n\nThe only explanation I could think of was that they initially used a different method to detect the protein content, or that the company has reduced the amount of protein in the bar over time.\n\nIs there other possible reasons behind this very low protein content detected?",

Pizza where the entire bottom had black spots everywhere, vegetables with charred black spots, meat... I've been avoiding food like that for now but how bad is it for you really? Is there a huge difference in health risk between something being just golden brown and something having black spots? If vegetables are a bit charred how bad is that? For example are roasted brussel sprouts with black marks still a health positive overall?",
