        "text": "Negatives about the company:\n\nAs a disclaimer, I worked at this company for 5 and 1/2 months. My average performance percentages were 99.7%, 94%, and 98%. This compares to the averages of low to mid 80%, I was by no means a slacking employee.\n\nThat said, I hate this company and the atmosphere of emotional abuse and harassment that it condones.\n\nLet’s start with the basics. What they tell you is that you will be answering client calls and cataloging notes in related accounts. You will be investigating fraud and submitting those investigations to departments for cases to be opened. You will be assisting customers in confirming payment information and the ordering of new cards. All of this is correct. All of this is also skewed to be untrue.\n\nNow let’s talk about what you will actually do and put up with at this company: This company partners with Child Support and issues out these pre paid debit cards that Child Support will load the money onto.\n\nLet’s be clear: Anything and everything that goes wrong or is inconvenient for these parents, they will call you about and berate you, and you have to take it all.\n\nThey will tell you in training that “we are messing with their money and their kids so they will get agitated.” What that means: “we make it so that we can charge them every fee under the sun and then blame it on Child Support so that we can continue to collect funds.”\n\nNot everything is the company fault, maybe 95%. The other 5% is when two things typically happened: They lose their card for the 5th time in three months and want you to replace it for free (yes this happens all the time) or they can’t manage the $12,000 they get from baby daddy’s tax return and blow it all in a month and want you to go over every transaction ever made to find who stole their money.\n\nOh let me remind you, you have to keep your call average time to 3 minutes or less otherwise you get written up. Keep that in mind as you read the rest of this review if you’re still not convinced that this job is of Satan’s Hellfire.\n\nDuring a typical call, you have to verify three things in order to verify a caller. SSN (yes we have to ask for that over the phone in order to pull up the account), first and last name, and the address on their file. The addresses were the WORST. Some of these people move around 18 times a year (yes I had this one time), there is no way that they will know the address we have. They certainly won’t be able to tell you in under three minutes. If they don’t know the address they are considered unverified and we cannot help them, we also cannot escalate them to management because management won’t talk to someone who is not a cardholder. They have to contact Child Support to figure out what address Child Support have to us and then call back and verify so we can assist. Sounds great already, right?\n\nThree kinds of callers to watch out for: young mothers from Florida, anyone who calls from Connecticut (seriously, Connecticut has the rudest people I’ve ever had the displeasure of wasting air on), and little old grandmothers from North Carolina. These callers were my personal worst but difficult people from other states would call in and try to compete with that raking from time to time.\n\nMy worst callers were NC grandmothers who thought I was the ground that they could waddle over on their canes for wasting their time because most were retired and taking care of daughter’s kids because she was legally unfit or just irresponsible.\n\nConnecticut speaks for itself, vile, ugly, and disrespectful waste of oxygen.\n\nYoung mothers from Florida basically got mad when you told them anything that they didn’t like and processed to try to bully you on YOUR phone line. Cussing up and down, running up your call time just because you can’t reactivate a lost card so she can renew her Netflix account with her Child Support money (yes this happened constantly).\n\nManagement was equally but possibly more horrid than the callers. The callers were partially so bad because the company would put them in that situation to begin with. You tend to figure that out in your first two weeks.\n\nI had management consistently tell me to purposely negate information and blatantly lie to callers in order to get them off the line to take the next caller. We were not allowed to tell callers times when their cards were to arrive even if we had access to tracking information (which you do for express cards). By the way, standard shipping normally is 7-10 business days. “Express” shipping is 3-5 business days. Callers got mad that too, of course but that was the company’s policy.\n\nWe were not allowed to say that fraud was on the accounts if we noticed it. If they said that they did not make a transaction and that it was fraud, we could open a dispute unless they explicitly asked for it. Even if they did, we had to tell them to file a police report before we could file the dispute. Management screwed me a few times on this, they would tell you this but then throw you under the bus during reviews if you did it. There was a lot of that at the company.\n\nI could go on, but I hope you get the idea.\n\nTL;DR: If you value yourself as a person who deserves respect, do not take this job. You will be disrespected by the callers and the company you work for everyday you work multiple times a day. Worse job I’ve ever had, and arguably ever will have.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice to Management:\n\nI could say vile things just like the vile, ugly, and profane things that I was forced to endure at your company. But I won’t. I don’t swear. Good thing I’m creative.\n\nThis company deserves to burn. The amount of solid trash that this company spews to their customers and forces us to reinforce is astonishing. Honestly, you guys deserve a medal. A medal barrel to dump all your contracts in and burn them for how disgraceful and deceitful this company is.\n\nI once had a mother call in and tell me that her son was in the hospital for the past week and a half and that he had died during that time. You know what could have saved him? I bet you do. She called in to order a new card, we ordered one for her and it got lost. I hear you saying “well that’s on the shipping company not us.” Sure. Sure it is. But you know what? She had the old card, she found it and we wouldn’t permit the reactivation of her old card in order to allow access to her money.\n\nShe called outside the hospital room where her kid died wanting on money that you heartless scum wouldn’t release to her based on policy. I get policy, I do. I also get exceptions to policy. This was an exception, and I had to listen to this mother scream at ME for YOUR ridiculous policy.\n\nShe cried and yelled for 28 minutes. I didn’t end the call, I didn’t offer a card, I didn’t even request management so she yell at someone else because management follows the rules that the company sets up.\n\nI listened to her. Waited for her to calm, and listened some more and she detailed day by day of what she had to endure as she waited to a solution that you refused to give her.\n\nShe hung up herself after she exhausted herself and you know what? I just took the next call with a little shake in my voice, but nothing else betrayed what I just heard.\n\nYou people, you disgusting people, desensitized me to the point that I was capable of going through that and just taking the next call. I hope you’re happy because I will never forget that.\n\n\nI truly loath and distain you in a way I never have felt before for anything else. I will be happy to help bring this company down once you finally get what is coming to you.",

        "text": "Hello once again all, I come to you after an extended lunch due to me wanting to murder my customer and being too worried to calm down. For info:\n\nI work for an appliance manufacturer as a customer care squad member, and recently raised up in the ranks as a mentor and a lead when needed. Today has been especially rough as I had gotten a phone call from my father that my cousin who lives in a certain state you WILL have heard of was involved in a school shooting this morning and at this point we had not heard anything about his safety. \n\nIt was bright and early and I was doing 'walking' which is where a trainee on the phone will raise their hand when they need help, a Walker comes over to help them through the issue. A semi\\-great guy so far raised his hand and this glorious moment where I lost my cool happened.  I'm not proud of it...but it happened. I asked my mentee what was up. Men=Mentee, Bug\\-me, Does Not Compute/DNC=customer. \n\nMentee: This lady's flying off the handle because the service tech cancelled for this morning's appointment...what do I do? \n\nBug: Ok, that's fine, things happen sometimes...let's try to call and see why.\n\nSo I plug into their computer and they call up the tech office. We eventually figure out it's because the customer lives in a urban area not even a few blocks from the very same school that my cousin goes to and the servicer also has children that go to that school and they have stopped everything until they know everyone is alright/stay out of the way for the police to finish up. I instantly see re,d and as my mentee is staring at me like he's about to pass out I barge in and take over the call. I thank the servicer, wish him and his kids safe, and hang up to go back to DNC. \n\nBug: Hello DNC I'm Bug and I'm a Certified Care Member taking over for Men. Now the reason your appointment was cancelled for today is due to a local emergancy, the service company thought it best to stay out of the area and give their employees time to breathe and wait for word from their kids.\n\nDNC: I don't CARE about that! I was promised Effing service today!\n\nBug: I apologize ma'am, but as there is SWAT team and police everywhere at the local schools they have deemed their children's safety a bigger priority right now. I understand it's frustrating, but at this time all I can do is reschedule you service, but if there is any openings today that same service tech may be able to come out depending on when this issue with the school is resolved?\n\nDNC: THAT'S NO WHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH! \n\nBug: I apologize again, but there are children that is hurt, scared, and wanting nothing more than their families and to be out of a building that's supposed to be safe for them, your dishwasher can wait.\n\nDNC: \\-MY\\- kids go to a better school then that place for\\-\n\nBug: DNC. My cousin goes to that school, up until now he wanted to be a crime\\-scene investigator however I'm not even sure if he's alive. I've been off the phones since 8:30 this morning and I did not come back until I had cried it out and felt I could speak without wanting to scream.  Your dishwasher WILL wait. Enjoy the rest of your day.\n\n...and I disconnected, patted my mentee and went to have another cry/break at my supervisor's insistence and that lady is now going to be handled by major supervisors only from here on out...a lot of us were quite sour at her. My coworker brought her dotsons to visit me, they were cute and after finding out that my cousin was ok...could finally go back to work. I haven't seen any sort of write\\-up yet but I am waiting for one to appear in my email. ",

        "text": "This is more of a general interaction that occurs for me multiple times daily as a call center rep of a major Canadian telecom company with a circular red logo. It frustrates me to no end, and I’ve been thinking of ways to word my response(s) or gather more details of what they are actually looking for. I get that people tend to want the newest products at the best deals 100% of the time, but being this ignorant is irritating and harmful.\n\nHere is the general conversation I’m talking about here:\n\n$ME = me, obviously\n$CX = customer I’m speaking to at the time \n\n—\n\n$ME: Hi there! You’ve reached RedHot with RedCompany* in (location/country), can I please get your first and last name? (General intro + variations)\n\n$CX: My name is (insert customer’s name here).\n\n$ME: Great! (VARIFIES $CX INDENTITY &amp; SECURITY QUESTIONS, ETC**) And what can I do for you today, $CX?\n\n$CX: Yeah so, I’m pretty sure my plan (they mean contract*) is almost done and I was wondering what I can get.\n\n$ME: By that, do you mean you’re looking for a new device?\n\n$CX: Well, obviously....\n\n$ME: Okay, that’s great! We have a ton of new devices we can look at here, and some are even on promo right now for $0 up front, if you have our Premium Plus share cellphone plan. What kind of device would you be interested in/did you already have an idea of what you’re looking for?\n\n$CX: Well I mean, that should be obvious if you actually go over my account details. But I’ve never paid for any devices from you guys and I’m not going to now. Also what is “Premium Plus”? I like the plan I have now and I know you guys like to upsell to the most expensive option, if you try that on me I’ll just go somewhere else.\n\n$ME: While we certainly wouldn’t want to lose your business, especially after you’ve spend x-amount of years with us as a loyal customer (based on what the account activation date states), the new devices that are coming out are, on average? Between $900 and $1500 CAD to purchase outright, due to new technologies and the increasing cost of manufacture. If you don’t mind waiting a moment, I’ll review your account and see if I can find a decent offer for you based on what you have with us currently.\n\n($CX agrees, and I either make small talk while looking, press for more information on their needs, or place them on hold to see if anything new worth mentioning has come up in promotions while I was unaware. Usually in these cases, it is a customer that has historically only purchased devices with the distinctive fruit logo on them, and routinely threatens escalations or cancellation if we don’t lower the cost - these customers also often either have a plan on the account from 2012 that is grandfathered and not eligible for top-tier pricing without a change, have some insanely inexpensive promotional plan that rolled out at Christmas time and isn’t eligible for a contract at all, or have some sort of sweet deal discounts applied by our retention department. In all of the above cases, the customer wants to get a $0 phone without a plan change. Based on current offers and account activity, I can sometimes be empowered to offer up to $150 off the device cost upfront, apply a bonus GB of data, or offer them a loyalty plan which is usually $10-$40 lower than in-market pricing. This is often still not good enough.)\n\n$ME: (bringing my findings to the customer) Great news! It looks like I can offer you a FruityPhone 8, 64GB model, for $0 - it is on for $99 on our top-tier plan option, which WOULD require a plan change, however I would be able to apply a credit of $100 towards that cost, and we also have a plan here that would get you that offer that has the exact same features you currently pay for, but with one more GB of data, and it is only $20 more per month than you currently pay. This is our best promotional offer at this time.\n\n$CX: I told you I am NOT changing my plan. I like what I have right now and why would I pay more every month for exactly the same thing I already have?!?\n\n$ME: I understand your concern with the pricing, however with the FruityPhone 8, and how we base our 2 year contracts, you would need to pay a little bit towards the cost of the phone every month in order to get such a low price upfront. Unfortunately right now you have a plan that is not eligible to receive the same pricing offer unless it were to change - without changes, the phone would be approximately $600 up front for you, but WITH the changes I suggested, you would technically be saving a further $120 on the cost of the new device. As well, due to the promotion, you would get 1GB of bonus data for free.\n\n$CX: But I’ve been a loyal customer with RedCompany for (insert amount of years that is way beyond what the account states or even is longer than the company has been in business) years and you guys won’t give me a DECENT offer to stay with you?!? GreenWireless* was offering the new FruityPhone 8 *PLUS* for $0 -AND- my plan would be only $40 a month!!! You guys are just thieves trying to steal from hard working peopleZ if that company can offer those prices why can’t you do the same?? Do you WANT to stay in business??\n\n(Cue $ME attempting to explain the difference in service between OUR company and the value brand company they were speaking of, the difference in what the plans would include - ours is usually all inclusive unlimited national minutes and texting and etc, their usually has limited minutes but more data - and the fact that the prices are usually x-amount but I’ve offered it to them at a reduced rate. They almost always try to escalate which ends with me getting them to retention, or they hang up. Phones and services cost MONEY, people!!)\n\n—\n\nAnother one that confuses me is when I get calls from people claiming they “never signed a contract”. They will have purchased a brand new device, new plan at a loyalty rate, the phone is $0 due to agent credits and yet they become absolutely irate when they suddenly call in to cancel 4 months later and are told they will have to pay out the $900 they owe on their contract balance. “But the phone WAS -FREE-!! Your agents told me I would not pay a thing!! THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING AND I WILL SUE YOUR COMPANY IF YOU CHARGE ME THIS BUT I AM STILL CANCELLING.” ..... our company has never, to my knowledge, simply handed out free devices on no contractual basis and allowed customers to just leave with them. Sigh..\n\nI get that you may not understand the entire pricing system behind it, but our agents do their best to EXPLAIN it to you before purchase, AND it is written in your contract in plain language. If you don’t understand, don’t buy!!\n\nSorry for the excessive length!",

I don't believe in anything to do with the government. \n\n&gt;Me: Right so unfortunately, our agency cannot write you a policy if you don't have a valid driver's license.\n\n&gt;CL: Umm but I remember I had insurance before and I never had a license.\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah, it's rare, but there are some insurance companies that can write policies without your license.\n\nWhich is like a super high risk for those insurance companies, which is why we don't do it.\n\n&gt;CL: Ok well I guess I'm gonna have to look around more.\n\n&gt;Me: Yup, have a nice day!\n\nLike. Who are these people who think they don't have to abide by the laws of the country? Like, you are a citizen. You live here. You get the benefits and challenges of this country.\n\n\nMy friend and boyfriend told me later that those people are called Sovereign Citizens. Basically people are are totally anti-government and think that they don't have to follow their laws, basically because they don't want to.\n\nWild.\n",

Apparently she and her husband don't use titles, or surnames. When they got married in the 80s they decided that they would be known only by first names. I found this interesting and asked if there was any sort of philosophical or religious reasoning behind it- apparently not, they just 'liked the idea'.\n\n\n\nNow yes, personal freedom etc, but all I could think is that for 30+ years that couple have been making their own lives and those of anyone trying to deal with them in any customer service capacity unnecessarily difficult by insisting on using a name they know won't fit on any forms. They probably get a buzz out of being shocked and offended every time someone gets it wrong though.",

So i tried my best to inform her that it will take until the afternoon or evening to activate which leads to her going absolutely bonkers, while it is actually pretty much her fault since she had to take a business contract with us if she wanted to get us to be contractually obligated to activate it at a certain and time.Que business woman going into full meltdown.. Excerts of her comments include \"I dont know how much money you make but i make 130 dollars an hour and dont have time for this\" \"If i have to think for you aswell as for myself that is unacceptable\" and some more lines of general \"you are a untermensch\" kind of comments. Now i just started 2 months ago in this line of work and i have myself mostly under control so all i can muster is not saying too much so i dont go off on her. While she is venting she goes on that she will cancel all contracts with us immediatly which is my way out since i am obligated to connect her with the customer service center that handles this sort of thing. This was at 7:30 so i click the button to connect her with another part of customer service that handles this kind of thing when it hits me....They..open..at..8...\nSince i would have walked straight ouf of the building if i had to talk to this human trashbag again i....hit the forward call button....and then silence...peace...I expected all kind of backlash from this incident but there was none. There might be a god after all, or someone who just really hates shitty people.(I had my defense already prepared in my mind, like that i \"am new\" and that i \"forgot\" that they arent around until 8.

This takes place near the end of my career, as I realized I'm just not as masochistic as the job requires.\n\nIt was a long call, so I'll try to keep it as short as I can while not losing anything important in translation!\n\nSK = me, CT = Clueless Teenager, CS = Chill Supervisor\n\n\\*beep beep\\*\n\nSK: Thank you for calling \\*REDACTED\\*, my name is ShopKo! \\(Verification goes as well as it ever does.\\)\n\nSK: Thank you for that information, what can I help you with today?\n\nCT: My bill is waaay too high, I can't pay that. Just close my account.\n\nDisconnects are no bueno for Red Cellular. I go into my well\\-trained recovery mode, thinking I can probably save them with a better plan or something.\n\nSK: Well, let me pull up your most recent statement and see what I can do here for you!\n\nThat's when my palm made forceful enough contact with my face to shatter bone. Usually when I got these kinds of calls it was something simple, like late fees or suspension fees. NOPE. CT managed to rack up ≈$900 worth of international charges to Guatemala. I ping my supervisor, CS, knowing that we'll have to go into damage control to keep this person.\n\nSK: It seems you have about $900 worth of international calls to Guatemala, do you remember calling anybody there between X\\-date and Y\\-date?\n\nCT: Yeah, I called my cousin. Listen, I can't afford this. I'm still in High School, how am I supposed to pay for this?!\n\nAround this time, CS swings by my cube. I put CT on hold and discuss options with CS. I'm a softie at heart, so I play the sympathy angle with CS. Dumb kid doesn't know better, etc. Eventually get him to agree to waive a maximum of 50&amp;#37; of the charges. Side note, we're supposed to start at 10&amp;#37; and negotiate our way up to the limit we're given on waivers this large. I end the hold with CT.\n\nSK: Good news! I spoke with my team lead about this, and I got them to agree to waive $450 off of your current bill, bringing the total to $X\\-450!\n\nCT: No, that's still way too much! I told you, I'm in High School and I can't pay for this. Just close out my account now.\n\nI'm not sure if I convey it as well in writing, but my 'customer service' persona is exceedingly pleasant and accommodating. One of my co\\-workers from training referred to me as 'The Unflappable Man', and it had nothing to do with my lack of upper body strength.  But sometimes you just gotta cut the act and get real with people, ya know?\n\nSK: Look, I get it. It's a really big bill, and I would probably freak out if I got this in the mail. Technically, I can close this account for you. But let me tell you what happens after that. As the account is in your name and there is a current balance on the account, you are still legally liable for making that payment. If you don't pay it, it goes to a collections agency. I've had an account or two of my own in collections, and it's definitely not fun. I also see that you have a new FruityPhone on both lines on your account that you are paying for monthly. As they are outside the window for our returns policy, the remaining balance will be added to your final bill, bringing to total to roughly $1900.\n\nCT: ....\n\nSK: Usually in cases like this it's my job to tell people that since they admitted to making those international calls, their bill is accurate and must be paid. What I'm offering you here is $450 off of a bill that you admitted is accurate. So we can go ahead and waive that for you or we can close out your account, which I'm suggesting not as a representative of Red Wireless but as a person to another person you do not do.\n\nCT: ...Is there any way you could take more off of the bill? \n\nSK: Officially, I was supposed to offer you $90 and work from there. The $450 is the maximum amount we are willing to waive. I didn't feel it was worth either of our time to go back and forth on the number, so I offered the maximum.\n\nCT: Okay.\n\nSK: Alright, give me just a moment to get this approved for you!\n\nPut CT on hold to get the approval for the $450 waiver from CS. \n\nCS: Did you get them to add on an international plan? You know this kind of thing needs a fail\\-safe so it doesn't happen again before I can approve it.\n\nSK: ...Yes...\n\nCS: Okay, cool! It's done.\n\nHop back onto the phone with CT.\n\nSK: Alright, your current balance due is $X\\-450! Just in case, try not to call Guatemala from your phone in the future. If you have to, you can turn on Wi\\-Fi calling and make the call through your home Wi\\-Fi connection. As far as the billing system can tell, that's a local call.\n\nCT: Okay, thanks...\n\nTL;DR: I get some clueless kid a bundle off of their phone bill, but to get them to agree to the exact number I had to play the bad guy and detail exactly what happens to accounts when they close and never pay their final bill.\n\nHope you all get a chuckle out of my pain!",

        "text": "**context**\nI've worked in call center's for a total of 4 years. I've done a variety of things from billing to tech. Its a draining job for sure. Today I took a call from a customer who ordered a shiny new super smart phone; was really upset with her entry level phone. She thought this may be the solution as people say fruit phones are easier to use. Understandable, but she really needed a phone to make calls. Looking at her history I can tell she does not do much, maybe a Facebook account. She was super upset, did not know how to turn on the phone. We tried and tried. Where she lives, she could not activate the line without connecting to wifi because she lived in a marginal service area in Montana. Her wifi password was a combination or uppercase and lowercase with O's and zeros. This exasperated the situation to total meltdown. After a few minutes this older woman was SOBBING. I had helped her determine her wifi pw on the belly label of the router, helped her find how to turn it on, told her how to use uppercase and lowercase on the key pad. I could tell this was super frustrating for her, all the wile her dog (some spadoodle shepherd mix mut she saved from a shelter) stepped in a rat glue trap. The whole experience was overwhelming. She could never enter the wifi pw correctly and gave up and muttered the words \"I should just kill myself, I thought this was going to be better.\" It was just a snowball of emotion. I kept calm and talked to her about her pets and recommended that she take the phone in to get it set up as she had an appointment with someone in town 40 miles away that teaches tech to older folks. She further got upset as she could not find the information for her appointment, the address etc. It REALLY left an impression on me. It made me feel sad and the hardest part of this job is dealing with difficult ~~customers~~ situations. She actually left me a glowing survey, and I want to share a few tips for others in the industry that could make this job a little easier mentally. For yourself and others.\n\n**Advice**\nWe are emotional beings. Our brains are built over this brain-stem and evolved from there. The basic part of our brain, the amygdala, sits directly on top of our brain stem. It controls our flight or flight response, and is situated in such a way that it can deliver a very fast response. Given that, our brains have grown very quickly to accommodate for critical thinking and memory. The amygdala floods the body with cortisol and adrenaline, and this serves to cut off the critical thinking part of the brain (cortex) and just act. We have evolved so fast, that in the context of non life-threatening situations this \"Amygdala Hack\" can be triggered by any stressful situation. Anyone is susceptible to an \"Amygdala Hack\" - Everyone you take a call from has different things going on. Maybe they are elderly and are confused. As a husband to a nurse, I know that confused people can exhibit very frustrating emotions. Moreover, some people may be in bad positions, have lost jobs, wrecked their cars, lost a loved one. Because of this, I try to be cognizant of the AH in all interactions. Its so easy to be hacked yourself. \n\n**Recommended reading**\nhttps://heist.miraheze.org/wiki/Amygdala_hacks\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/055338371X",

Anyways, sometimes things don't go well for customers because we sell a commodity that's only available in single quantities. You can buy two things from us that are only off by one thing but you're still buying different things. \n\nSo in this case the customer bought the same thing as another customer and the other customer bought it first so they got it. We weren't able to offer this customer an alternate thing because we were out of this particular thing. \n\nHere's his response in all of it's glory. (names changed to protect the innocent)  \n\nThank you for your response, person, sadly it is what I expected.\n\nI suggest the owners of you company (not you, you are just the piano player) go to the nearest grocery store, procure a brown paper bag, cut holes in the area of the eyes and place the bag over their heads.  It is one way to hide the shame.\n\nI am hoping, for your sake that you will soon find employment with a company that has great character.

        "text": "This is the story about the most emotional call I've ever taken. I work at an ISP as a tier 2 representative for tech support. Essentially, one of the jobs I have is programming calling features.\n\n\nThis call in particular happened about a month ago. A ticket had came to my queue about a customer having trouble accessing her voicemails. I dug deeper and found it was full as well. No problem, there were some programming errors, which I fixed and called the customer who will be known as Sweet Elderly Woman. (SEW)\n\n\nSEW: Hello?\n\n\nMe: *intro, verification* So, I am calling because you reported an issue with your voicemail today.\n\n\nSEW: Oh yes! Is it fixed?\n\n\nMe: Yes! It should be. I found that your box is full. It has *maximum amount* of messages in it.\n\n\nSEW: Dear, I'd hate to be a bother but could I get you to go in and delete them for me? (We have a way of accessing the messages if the customer cannot, doesn't want to, etc.) \n\n\nMe: Absolutely. I will gladly do this for you, SEW and I'll call you back when I'm finished?\n\n\nSEW: Yes please!\n\n\nShe thanks me and I hang up to go access the messages. Knowing full well that this is going to take at least 15 minutes, I go and read Wikipedia articles as the messages are playing. I eventually reach the last message and it catches my attention. I stopped reading, listened to it, began tearing up and saved it in her box. I compose myself before calling back.\n\n\nSEW: Hello?\n\n\nMe: Hi! It's /u/devdevo1919 again. I listened to all the messages and deleted them all except for one.\n\n\nSEW: Oh thank you, sweetheart! Why did you leave one?\n\n\nMe: SEW, I think you should listen to it. I will hang up to give you some time, okay?\n\n\nSEW: Okay, dear.\n\n\nI gave her time to listen to the message and called her back. She was crying when I called her back. It was then I learned the story. The message was from her husband who had passed away due to brain cancer 3 days after he left the message. It was him saying goodbye and that he loves SEW so much and he's \"never felt more alive\" all the years she spent with him. \n\n\nSEW was crying because he was deceased by the time she got to the hospital and had not heard his voice. She said I gave her part of herself back that she'd lost when he passed away. She thanked me and we disconnected the call.",

        "text": "I work in lawn care. Well known, well hated company. Some times we get the job done, some times we do not. As I am sure you are all aware, being in a call center and working inbounds, my jobs are to resolve the situation at hand and suppress any further calls. That last bit is very hard. \n\nPretense for the first story, in our system you can prepay for a full programs worth of service. This could be 4 services per year up to 12+ services per year in some* areas. When you prepay for the services the system inflates the value of the money at hand because if it doesn't, it looks like you shorted us and then you would owe a bill at the end of the year. This normally is not an issue unless someone checks their service online and wants to cancel and then issues a refund for a smaller amount. \n\nI regularly take over escalated calls because we are short one floor manager and I also have no problem telling a customer they are wrong, I am right, end of story. \n\nScene 1:\n\n*lady is irate because we refunded her less than the number she saw on the computer. 2 other representatives have attempted to assist her but since they have not claimed to be a manager the customer is now irate and I have to take over.* m for me. L for lady.\n\nM: Hi this is Miguel1226, floor manager, how may I help you.\n\nL: YOU FUCKERS BETTER GIVE ME MY FUCKING MONEY OR I WILL SUE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.\n\nM: Well, first of all there is no money on this account to give you. We refunded you [amount] on [date]. Second, I had heard you were being rude to my representative before i took over the call, one more outburst and I will terminate this call.\n\nL: Dont you fucking dare hang up this call. I'll have you know i know your manager [name] and if you hang up on me I will rain fire down on you.\n\nM: I am sorry, but due to excessive profane language i will have to terminate this call. *click* that person is not even a manager. He is a sales rep....\n\n*lady calls back, gets a different agent, but still in my office. I take over the call from where we left off.*\n\nM: intros call as above*\n\nL: oh YOU again. You guys still owe me money.\n\nM: no ma'am, not according to this system, but if you can tell me why you feel that way I would be happy to explain or refund any additional amount that would be due.\n\nL: when i looked online it say I had a credit of [approx 340.XX]. I only got a refund of [approx 320.XX]. You. Owe. Me. Money! *heavy breathing*\n\nM: oh! Well i am glad you are so attentive to the online website! However, I have to let you in on a secret. That number reads false because of your tax rate in the area. \n\nL: you are going to try and do the math with me and show that [number of services left] matches the number I was refunded like the last person and no!\n\nM: no. I am not. If you have a calculator and would listen to what i have to say, you would know that, when you add taxes to the number you were refunded it will show you the exact amount you gave me earlier. \n\nL: *does math..... with a little bit of help* well that's right stupid. Why the hell does it do that??\n\nM: if we didn't inflate the number on our end, to the computer it looks like you shorted us, so you would end up with a bill at the end of the season. \n\nL: oh. Okay then. Thank you so much! Bye!\n\nScene 2 - there is a very intricate thing called aeration that lawn companies do. It is one of the best things for lawn care. It has the potential to break things underground on the property if the person doing it is not aware of where these things may be located.\n\nPretense: we broke a customers underground fence. He said it costed 1200$ to install. He says it would have to come out of the companies pocket. The company he contracted to fix it, is a company we use often. We were already billed and already took care of the payment. To fix it, it was about 100$. Customer still owes us 400$ cause we did the work and took care of the damage. M - for me. G - for guy.\n\n*I am taking over as a floor manager again because he has gotten one of the newer reps, fresh out of training. They are notoriously bad at reading notes.*\n\nM: Hi this is Miguel1226, am I speaking with G?\n\nG: yes. You guys say I still owe you money when i told you I'm not paying for this because you broke my underground fence even though it was marked off.\n\nM: *remembers me being the first person to handle this call when it first came up right after the fence was broken and one of our other managers handled the issue already* Oh! Mr. G! Hello again. I am the first person that handled this for you. I am sorry to say this, but you still owe us the [approx amount of 400$].\n\nG: What! But why! It costed 1200$ you guys had to fix the fence I shouldn't owe you guys a penny!\n\nM: that would be true, but we already paid for the fence and the 1200$ price you gave me before was for installation. Fixing the break only ended up being around 100$ and [my company] regularly contracts that company to fix these breaks when they happen. They already billed us. We already paid them. The most that I could take off would be the value of the break.\n\nG: But..... Well then i want the value of the break taken off my bill. For inconvenience.\n\n*as I am not actually a manager I just take over manager calls when they are unable to, this was not within my power, but I usually get around these things. It's always fun to make customers fight for something i would have given them anyways though.*\n\nM: No. Can't do that. Sorry. We already covered that bill in full and the only hassle you might have gone through would have been calling the company we were going to call in the first place. Since you told them it was our fault they already knew to bill us. \n\nG: Well i am not paying that balance in full I want some sort of compensation. \n\nM: hmm. Okay, let me place you on hold so I can play with the numbers.\n\n*I was going to give him the change and make it a flat 400$ price and I took the time to train the new agent on how to handle a call like this in the future and how to submit the price change, with my approval on behalf of my supervisor. The hold was just to make him wait in silence.*\n\nM: okay, for the inconvenience I have been able to bring the price down to 400.00$ you can either send us a check, pay online, or pay with me. \n\nG: I want more off than that. I want to pay around 370$. \n\n*yes, I could do this. No lol I won't though.*\n\nM: sorry, G. No can do. Final price is 400.00$ even. You can pay as much of that as you like, whatever you don't pay will be sent to collections after 120 days. \n\nG: not even an extra 30$!? This company is such bullshit..... *waiting for me to cave*\n\nM: *stays silent* \n\nG: Fine whatever. I'll pay. *he pays with me*\n\nM: Why thank you! And i see that you are still signed up with up with us for this season. Since its March, I'll be happy to give you our match madness discounts for your first couple of visits. If you want you can prepay for these and get an additional amount off, but that's necessary, it is merely an offer. \n\nG: I'll see. Send it to me in the mail.\n\nM: can do, thank you, have a nice day!\n\nI checked back on his account 2 weeks later and he made the prepayment as well. I feel like he had money to blow but was just giving us a hard time about it.",

Ma'am do you just want to go speak with tech support?\n\nLady:*scoff* (hang up)\n\nI'm not sure whether to be annoyed or feel sorry for her....and her boyfriend.

        "text": "I had to break the bad news to a customer that he is not eligible for benefit due to his circumstances. There's the usual tirade about how he has to provide for his girlfriend, soon-to-be born baby and other kids. (I wonder why they choose to have kids if they're struggling financially, but I digress.)\n\nHe demands to speak to my supervisor, who told him the exact same thing that I did. However, his story changed. He broke up with his girlfriend since last week and they are planning to live separately. He will not be participating in parenting duties.\n\nSo my supervisor advised that he claimed a different benefit as a single person. When the phone call is over, I said \"Well, that was a fast break up. Ten minutes ago, he told me something else.\" My supervisor said \"If he wants to dig his own grave and crawl into it, it's his choice. If he gets caught and punished for benefit fraud, that's his problem.\"\n\nI do feel bad for people who struggle financially, but some of their circumstances are the result of their personal choices. Why did they have 3 or 4 kids if you can't afford to? Why did they turn up to work drunk, assault someone and end up getting fired? Why go on holiday when you're broke and about to be homeless?",

The story might seem trivial, but this \"lady's\" tone almost made me tell her to go fuck herself. I deal with entitled people and idiots every day, but she was special. Here goes.\n\n\n\nMe: Good evening, this is [my name] speaking, how can I help you?\n\nHer: it's about tv.\n\nMe: Okay, can you please tell me your landline number.\n\nHer: [number], my husband is the owner. I need to know if I have a certain channel. \n\nMe: Okay, I'll need to tell me a couple of things since you're not the owner and you're not calling from that number. Can I have your billing account?\n\nH: Why in God's name do you need that?\n\nM: Since you're not the owner, I need that info so I can give you further information about the channels you have. [we have multiple tv packages] \n\nH: There is no way I'm going to look for BA.\n\nM: No problem. [I tell her I need different info then, that doesn't require her looking for anything].\n\nH: I'M JUST CALLING TO SEE IF I HAVE THAT CHANNEL, YOU SEE ALL MY INFO, WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THESE QUESTIONS?!?!\n\nM: [slightly annoyed, but stay polite] Olay, ma'am, I need that info if you want to know details of what you have, but if you don't have the necessary info, I'll just look up if we have that channel at all. Which channel is in question? \n\nH: [says the name]\n\nM: So it's [name]. Are you sure, because I can't find that channel.\n\nH: You should know how to do your goddamn job and know if you have that channel. Everybody has it. Yes, it's how I said it.\n\nM: Ma'am, we have more than 200 channels in our repertoire. There is no way I can know them all by heart. I checked again, and we don't have a channel with that name.\n\nH: Christ! You have no idea how to do your job! I'm going to call again and hope I don't get you! [hangs up]\n\n\nJust to be clear. I even checked on Google and that channel either doesn't exist or she has no fucking idea what it's actually called. It's amazing how people expect you to know 10000000 pieces of information off the bat. Bitch, we're the biggest carrier/isp in the country. There are million things and options and I can't know all of them by heart, especially since things change each day. \n\nFunny things is, I checked half an hour later if she called again. She either didn't or, less likely, next agent didn't note she called. ",

Single worst customer I’ve spoken with in a while 22 year history of working retail/CS. \n\nShe proceeded to berate me for 12 minutes because she had a return that she was attempting to send back to us. She had already printed the return label and, basically, wanted the shipping company to pick it up. Our contract doesn’t cover pick ups. You have to drop it off. You know, like ALL return labels, basically. “I’m disabled and I’m in a home! Are you fucking stupid? I’m not going anywhere! They need to fucking pick it up!” I explained that the shipper may make an exception in her case and waive the fee, but she would need to take it up with them. \n\nI spent 5 minutes asking her if she’d like the number to call the shipper. She kept telling me to “shut the fuck up and listen,” but then repeated to me that she “didn’t have a number to call the goddamned company!” Jesus Christ I hate this bitch. \n\nI listened to this shit, repeating that I had the number for her, asking if she wanted to write it down (“I DON’T HAVE A FUCKING PENCIL!””WHY isn’t it on the label?” - how the fuck do I know? The damned shipping company’s software generates the label. Take it up w/them!) before telling her three times that I would be disconnecting the call if she continued the profane language and general nastiness. On the third warning, she managed to get out, “I don’t give a fu...” before I hung up on her. First customer I’ve EVER disconnected. \n\nI was literally shaking I was so angry at the end of the call. Thankfully I was due for a break and got a few deeps breaths to rid myself of her toxicity. \n\nShe called back, twice, and yelled at two other reps. They messaged me after and said she was the worst customer they’d ever dealt with and they were as pissed as me. She got transferred to a supe on the third call and the supe is convinced she had sort of dementia. I’m convinced she’s just a cunt. If someone has issues that bad, it’s time for them to have a handler. Keep her away from the phone!! She was pissed our CS center is located in the US and vowed never to shop our company again.

        "text": "**tl;dr limo driver has an all-consuming need to be right, plays the professional victim, decides he's an all-in-one CEO/HR rep/constitutional law expert.**\n\nA few years ago, I'd been working tech support for a navigation company for less than a year and hadn't yet learned to hang up on customers who aren't worth the time and verbal / emotional abuse. I'd struggled a bit to learn everything and the last thing I wanted was to look like I didn't know what I was doing.\n\nIt was close to the end of the day. The customer, LDCL, had a unit was supposed to alert him to upcoming traffic. For some reason it wasn't, and that particular issue was a bit of an Achilles' heel for me to troubleshoot.\n\nLDCL wasn't actually a limo-driving constitutional lawyer, but he *was* a limo driver who used that unit for work, and my attempts to figure out and fix whatever was going on with it only seemed to piss him off. I can't remember what set him off exactly, but the situation deteriorated pretty quickly.\n\nIn the end, I decided we should start by replacing the receiver cable, but like a true n00b I made the mistake of telling him that I couldn't guarantee it'd work, since we weren't able to test &lt;something&gt;; if you find that to be the case, let us know and we'll just subtract the cost of the cable from the repair price of the out-of-warranty unit.\n\nThat's when the screaming started.\n\nUsually I could handle these calls by ignoring the insults, acknowledging their frustrations, taking their side as far as was allowed, and generally being nice to them. This helps turn down the heat about 95% of the time. LDCL, it turned out, was the other 5%.\n\nNo matter how sweetly I offered him sympathy and free shipping, then a free cable, it only seemed to rile him up further. Said I wasn't offering that to be nice to him, but only because I was required to by the Constitution. Somehow. Not having a JD, I couldn't say for certain how much of his half-screamed three-minute lecture on US constitutional and commerce law was full of BS, but that was probably the majority of it.\n\nAs much as I tried to be nice, I also had a pretty low tolerance for customers trying to bully me into giving them free stuff. Yet here I was, offering free stuff and he still wouldn't let me hear the end of it. Eventually, after about 45 minutes of being cut off and yelled at every time I tried to explain something, I started to lose patience.\n\n**Me:** \"I'm sorry this has put you in such a tight spot and caused so much stress, LDCL. Given everything you've described, I think it'll be fair to send you a cable free of charge. [It really wasn't and we'd already been over this twice, but I was running out of options.] Like I said, it might not work because it could be caused by something else on the unit, but trying a different cable is the only way to really check. If it doesn't work, again, we'll be happy to replace the unit.\"  \n**LDCL:** \"So you can't guarantee 100% that it's going to work?!\"  \n**Me:** \"It *should* work and I'm hopeful that it will, but you're right, I can't guarantee it.\"  \n**LDCL:** \"So you can't give me *ANYTHING* that's 100% guaranteed to work?!\"  \n**Me:** \"I'm afraid I can't, sir. Given that we don't live in a world of absolutes, there's no such thing as 100% probability.

I wouldn't comp him a new unit and he claimed to have 'friends in upper management' and told me I'd better prepare for a tap on my shoulder because he was going to have me fired, among other things. Even after he screamed for a supervisor, he still felt the need to cut me off and yell at me with some more BS as I tried to tell him I'd find him one, then hollered that I was 'threatening' to hang up on him when I told him I'd need to put him on hold to do so, told me again he'd get me fired, several other nasty personal insults I blessedly no longer remember, and on and on and on.\n\nFinally, I lost it.\n\n**Me:** \"I truly want to help you, LDCL, but so far we haven't made a lot of progress. I'll find an available supervisor for you to speak with as you requested, but I'll need to place you on ho—\"  \n**LDCL, interrupting me for the 300th time:** \"So you're threatening to hang up on me?!\"  \n**Me:** \"I'm not going to ha—\"  \n**LDCL:** \"That's exactly what you're doing, you're threatening me!\"  \n**Me:** \"LDCL, I'm sorry, we're not getting anywhere. If you keep interrupting me, I will need to end this call.\"  \n**LDCL:** \"So you ***are*** threatening me! You're gonna hang up this call?!\"  \n**Me:** \"*Yes,* I will hang up this call.\"  \n**LDCL:** \"So you're a liar and you've been a liar this whole time! You'd better look out for that tap on your shoulder, because you're going to have a pink slip on your chair on Monday morning!\"  \n**Me:** \"LDCL, do you truly think that threatening me will solve your problem?\"  \n**LDCL:** \"I'm the one threatening you?! Get me a supervisor! *You're* the one who's not doing your job and mistreated me by—\"  \n**Me:** ***\"LDCL, this isn't going anywhere. You have repeatedly interrupted me and refused my help, you have threatened my job, you have made personal attacks on me, and now you continue to interrupt me while I'm trying to contact a supervisor to transfer you as you asked. I can find you a supervisor, or we can end this conversation. Your choice.\"***\n\nI'd never shouted back at a customer before and I've never had to since.\n\nAfter a bit more bluster from him, I was finally able to hand him off to a supe, took off my headphones, and had a good cry for a few minutes.\n\nEventually I went over to Supe's desk to see how it was going and found him still on the phone with a thousand-yard stare saying \"Uh-huh… yes sir… yes sir.\" Took a walk, came back, and Supe was off the phone now with the same thousand-yard stare.\n\n**Me:** \"Um, how'd it go?\"  \n**Supe:** \"He yelled a lot and wanted a bunch of free stuff.\"  \n**Me:** \"Did he get that free stuff?\"  \n**Supe:** \"No.\"  \n**Me:** \"How'd he react?\"  \n**Supe:** \"He yelled some more and asked if I was on drugs and asked if I'd just come back from my real job wiping the floors as a janitor.\"  \n**Me:** \"…wow. So what'd you say?\"  \n**Supe:** \"I hung up on 'im.\"\n\nI'd never heard of a supe in this company hanging up on a customer and haven't since. Not even the outright sexist one who made a young girl cry on her first day because he wouldn't talk to a woman.\n\nTo this day, I haven't hung up on a customer. This one dude, I should have.\n\n**edit:** markdown failure",

That's my excuse for why I snapped at this guy lol.\n\n\n\nThe call started out with me helping him navigate his web account to look at some billing items. As a rule of thumb, my department will walk you through about 3 or 4 invoices and then we will ask that you look the rest up on your own. It's not hard, most people just need someone to guide them through a couple and they've got the hang of it. This guy, not so much. After about 5 or 6 items, I told him I couldn't go through any more because I have a lot of calls (true) and as long as he did everything else exactly the way we just did, he would have no problem. \n\n\n\nCaller: But I have more.\n\n\n\nMe: Yes sir, I understand, but if I went through every item with every caller like you're asking me to, I won't be able to help anyone else. Just do it the way I showed you and I assure you that you'll get the information you need. \n\n\n\n\n\nC:....Fine. Also, why hasn't anyone updated my bank information yet?\n\n\n\n\nMe: Sorry?\n\n\n\n\nC: I sent the form a couple of weeks  and nothing has been updated.\n\n\n\n\nMe: Well, there's no update on my end, so that makes me think we didn't get your fax. It only takes a couple of days to update, so my recommendation is to resend it and follow up by the end of the week. \n\n\n\nC: *laughing*\n\n\n\nMe: *confused but waiting for him to say something*\n\n\n\nC: This is crazy. You're just like the government. *laughs again*\n\n\n\nThis is where I started to catch a bit of an attitude, lol.\n\n\n\n\nMe: *sarcastically* I'm like the government?\n\n\n\nC: Yeah!\n\n\n\nM: Alright then.\n\n\n\nC: I send you something and even though I have PROOF I sent it, you'll tell me that you didn't receive it. I HAVE THE TRANSMISSION PAGE.\n\n\n\nMe: Those are confirmation the fax was sent, not that it was received. Please send it to us again at (fax number), and call back by Friday to confirm the update has been made.\n\n\n\nC: *angrily pushing fax machine buttons* That's where I sent it before!!\n\n\n\nMe: I believe you. \n\n\n\n\nC: We'll see what happens to you when your company loses all of us because you treat your business partners like GARBAGE.\n\n\n\nMe: *over it* I am here to help you. If all you're going to do is sit here and talk to me like this I'm going to hang up. Do you have any more questions for me? \n\n\n\nC: You could look up some more invoices with me, that would be helpful at least.\n\n\n\nMe: Thanks for calling. *disconnect*\n\n\n\nOh it felt so good. After typing it out it feels petty, but he was a douchebag.",

He was annoyed from the get go. \n\nHe will be Rude Man (RM) and I will be Me. \n\nMe: Thank you for calling X Utilities, This is SpookyCatMischief, how may I help you?\n\nRM: I want to transfer my services. \n\nMe: I can certainly assist you with this! Let me just verify the account. May I have you name? \n\nRM: Rude. \n\nMe: ... Okay. May I have your last name as well?\n\nRM: *In irritated tone* Man. \n\nI continue verifying the account. Part of our quality guidelines is checking notes for the past 60 days and giving 2 commitment statements. \n\nMe: I am going to just check your notes and then I will be able to transfer your services. *I pull up his oldest note within 60 days. He has 24 notes within the last 60 days. I only get as far as the first one* \n\nRM: You don't need to verify my notes! \n\nMe: I am sorry, this is part of my verification but I promise it will be a quick review.\n\nRM: I never called about this before! Can I do this online?! \n\nMe: Yes. You certainly have that option. *I proceed to explain how to navigate to that feature on the website*. \n\nRM: Will it be faster than you since nobody has to verify my notes?\n\nMe: Depending on your speed, that may be the case. \n\nRM: You know what?! I want your supervisor, you cu...condecending person. \n\nAt this point I offer the customer a supervisor callback (as per our procedure and the fact all the centers supervisors were just returning from a meeting and not avaliable) and look at the note I had pulled up early. He had cursed and and yelled at that agent as well. The note also indicates he had attempted fraud with 4 different responses to one of the verifications on the account and 3 of a different type of verification, prompting a request from us for an ID to be sent in. He absolutly refuses to be called back. \n\nI won't go into full details as this story is already quite lengthy but as I need to leave my desk to find a supervisor (because none were logged into chat since they were just returning from the meeting) I needed to place him on hold. He refused to give me permission. I need permission to apply proper Hold Ettiquate by Quality standards. Eventually he stopped replying and I just placed him on hold and prayed that Quality didn't listen to this call. No supervisors were visible except one, who was already with another agent. Eventually, my supervisor walks by and tells me to just transfer to her line and she will call back. \n\nI transfer and review the rest of the account. He has been so rude to so many agents! He has yelled, he has cursed, he has insulted one of our Spanish reps for having an accent and he doesn't want to speak to anyone with an accent. \n\nJust...wow. I see why he didn't want me reviewing his notes.",

        "text": "Hello once again my fellow phone jockeys! In the last month or so I've been promoted to the TCS...which in our Appliance Manufacturer company is a group of employees that are cross trained for mentoring/teaching newbies, taking regular calls, and answering supervisor calls when needed. \n\nI took all the training needed for those two new jobs...and promptly got thrown into training the newbies as my quality scores are almost perfect. Until today I haven't had any sort of issues with any of the newbies-in fact they've all been pretty good at keeping their heads up and taking criticism the way it should be. \n\nThe people in this tale shall be: Bug=me. Bie=my mentee, AMR=Against My religion Guy. \n\nApparently there was a mistake and I was routed into the supervisor answering Queue while having a mentee listen into my calls. This beautiful gem was what my mentee got for her first call listening in on in her entire career. \n\nOur system has a bit of a sultry woman saying small phrases to clue you into what the issue/appliance the consumer is calling about. This time she said, \"Resolution Specialist...escalation.\" \n\nBie: Uh what does that mean?\n\nI pulled up my notes from training and bit my cheek in preparation...messaging my mentee that this was a mistake and it's a escalated call. \n\nBug: Hello there, I'm Bug and I'm a resolution specialist from our SOUTHERN STATE office, am I speaking to Mr. AMR?\n\nAMR: You're a supervisor?\n\nBug: Yes sir, give me just a moment to refresh myself on your case, alright? \n\nHe mumbles an agreement and I put him on hold. \n\nBug: So, this is an escalated call and I should probably get you off the line for a hot minute, but I'm not going to because these are usually just, 'No you're not getting it but here's this' calls. \n\nBoy was I WRONG. See, he had dealt with our countertop appliance department beforehand...who has a strict instant replacement within 1 year policy. Oddly enough...he's gotten three different small appliances that have caught fire and 'burned' him. And now he's heaving the same complaint about his refrigerator. \n\nUsually these calls go to our Safety department...however the safety department uses the same leads for escalations. The notes say that without proof of injury we were still happy to send out a servicer to check on the unit. I got him back on the line to see why sending out service to see HOW the refrigerator had caught fire was such a bad idea. \n\nBug: Thank you for holding Mr. AMG. It seems like our Safety department wanted to send someone out to look at the damaged and determine what caused the refrigerator to catch fire. But you refused that...have you already had the Fire Marshall give a definite answer on what caused the fire? \n\nAMR: No. I didn't call the fire department, I had an extinguisher thanks to your SMALLER appliances burning on me!\n\nBug: Alright then, sir. Unfortunately to determine the cause of the fire and to repair or replace the unit we have to physically send someone to look at it. \n\nAMR: You can't do that! I've never had to have someone FIX the stuff, they just send me new ones!\n\nBug: I understand that, sir. But there's different warranties in place for different appliances. Larger main-home appliances have a repair warranty, however we should be able to replace it as long as a technician can go out and look at it, is it the time-frames that you can't do? \n\nAMR: No. Having people in my house is against my religion.\n\nBie: Say what now? What kind of religion does that?\n\nBug: ...sir? Your religion doesn't allow people into your home?\n\nAMR: That's right. No one is allowed into my home but direct family. SO. What are you going to do about that?\n\nBug:...well then I apologize but there's nothing we can do. Even if I sent a replacement someone would have to come into your home to deliver it as the refrigerator is too big to be left on a doorstep-and if you injured yourself further trying to get the refrigerator in yourself, we would be responsible. \n\nAMR: Wait-so I can't get a new one? \n\nBug: Unfortunately not sir. We are also not allowed to give out full refunds without physical proof of the failure. \n\nAMR then turned into a righteous roar of cursing and calling me a liar and demanding my boss. \n\nBug: ...alright sir, I'll be happy to further escalate this for you, please hold for me. \n\nI sent him to another resolution specialist per my protocol and labeled the file...while also sending it off to an executive and legal to check on because there was no way unless he was the unluckiest man in the universe that FOUR entire appliances from the same company all caught fire and burned him. Last I checked the Executive had called him and asked directly what religion it was, he didn't get an answer and labeled AMR as a potential scammer and that nothing would be done unless a technician or fire marshall had looked at it.\n\nI also condensed this down because frankly he screamed at me (with my mentee listening in) for a good 20 minutes and I've become numb to all the curses one can hurl at a lady on the phone and frankly most soar right over my head. Made for an interesting first day for my poor mentee though! \n\n",

I need you to fix it. \nM(e): I’m sorry this is happening...(verified his account) please tell me what the problem is. \nBC: well I turn on the TV and nothing happens. \nM: okay can you tell me what you see on the screen? Are there any error messages or just static? (9/10 times this is an input issue). \nBC: uhh well no, I’m blind. \nAt this point I realize how completely impossible this call is going to be. I have no way of seeing what’s on his screen and neither does he. For all we know, his TV was stolen last night and he’s sitting in front of a blank wall. I don’t want to be insensitive but I’m trying to problem solve. \nM: okay is there anyone else home who may be able to help us solve this? \nBC: no. It’s been out all day and I just need this to work. (He’s starting to get irate, which I totally get)\n\nIf I go through the regular troubleshooting script, it’s going to cause more issues than it’s worth. If he changes the input, he’s even more screwed. I look at his account and see that the type of receiver (TV box) he has was having a known issue that was easily solved by a reset. I decide to give it a try. \n\nM: okay sir, I want to try resetting your receiver. We’ve been having some issues with your model recently and it’s possible this will fix it. On the front of your receiver, open the little door and push the red button (I facepalm at this point since he can’t even see what color the button is, but I’m so used to saying this script). \nBC: okay I’ve done it. \nM: okay it’s going to take approximately 20 minutes for the reset to complete. I’m going to just stay on the phone for at least that long to see if it comes back up. If not, we will schedule a technician to come out. \n\nWe make small talk for the next 25 minutes until *bam* I hear the TV come on in the background. My gamble paid off. \n\nWe both cheered and I sent him on his way. My handle time sucked but it was worth it. \n",

This Friday just gone, I was the only one in, so when I went on lunch they got someone taking messages for me to call back when I got back. \nCalled a few people back, went smoothly, nothing to worry about. \n\nUntil APG (angry pothole guy), the conversation went something like this. \n\nMe- Good afternoon, is this APG?\n\nAPG- yes that’s me, who’s this?\n\nMe- it’s radcherrywinter calling from the highways department at the council, it’s just in regards to the potholes you reported on data protection road, I just wanted to make sure we have all the correct details. \n\nAPG- oh yes, well you see nothing ever gets done I always call I am always told someone will be out in the next 24 hours blah blah but all they do is put a white line around it!!!! And all you do at your little call centre is listen to us, press a few buttons and it never goes on to anyone !!\n\nHe proceeds to carry on like this for a few minutes \n\nMe- I’m sorry to hear that you’re unhappy with the resolution of the potholes on data protection road sir, I can assure you when you called yesterday the highways inspector went out and assessed the potholes, I understand he missed some further down the road, may I ask how deep they are?\n\nAPG- oh you always ask this stupid question how deep they are well there’s more risk factors than how deep they are you know! Every time it’s how deep are they and you know I refuse to answer I am telling you they are dangerous\n\nMe- unfortunately while I am able to understand it is a danger over the phone we do have categories and scales we need to put it against, I wouldn’t be able to treat this as urgent based on what you have told me. I understand you can’t go out and measure it but do you think you could fit a tennis ball inside the hole?\n\nAPG- no no no I’ve had this stupid question can you fit a tennis ball well it doesn’t matter get someone out now, you know we don’t sit here and call these for our entertainment young lady I actually have a life what do you do all day sit there and twiddle your thumbs? I certainly never hear anything back from you lot!\n\nMe- sir... I am calling you back now, you left a message with my colleague?\n\nConversation lasted another 10 minutes but his manner totally changed after I reminded him I was actually trying to get more info to help him out.

        "text": "I work at a call center for an online clothes retail store. I don't know if all call centers are like this, but at my job we are not allowed to hang up on customers. To do so is a firable offense. \n\nWell one day we had one of our bad regulars call in. It was a pair of sisters that frequently called in for price adjustments, and they would usually call back all day until someone at the call center would make a mistake and take an additional $50 of some jacket that was already 50% off when they bought it. \n\nPart of their system is to cause as much confusion and frustration on the phone as possible. They had a couple ways of doing in, including using multiple accounts with our system, reusing coupons codes, using different credit cards in different names, and repeatedly calling all day long until they got what they wanted. Perhaps one of the most frustrating things they did was beat their infant to make him/her cry. \n\nNow, obviously I cannot confirm this, but on the dozens of calls I fielded from these sisters there was always a crying infant in the background, and on many occasions I could hear a repeated slapping noise of what sounded to me like a hand against flesh. My imagination could only assume they were spanking the child to force it to cry. And this was such a frequent occurrence that it was explained to us in our training that it was a scam tactic to confuse us and get us off our scripting. So it was not just me, and it was not just a once or twice happening.\n\nNeedless to say, whenever I got a call from these sisters, I would grind my teeth and hope they were not actually beating a child to save money on a coat they were just gonna sell on ebay.\n\nAnyway, on this particular day I got a call from a sister asking about a coat. I looked it up as she rambled on and spoke to someone in the background, and almost instantly a baby started crying. I could tolerate this as I had a dozen times in the past. It was when she picked up the child and had him scream into the phone receiver that I couldn't take it anymore. Not only was that just piss poor motherhood, but that is just fucking rude to whomever you are speaking to.\n\nSo I hung up.\n\nI don't know if my boss' were bluffing when they said they would fire us, or if they just let this one slide, but no one ever brought it up, so I just kept going to work as usual.\n",

        "text": "First call of the day. Man believes he was double charged. I take a quick look at the account - apparently its true. This is sad. I will have to give him credit and ruin my credit per call metric. \n\n\nAnyways, I act nice and state I will take a look and review the account to see exactly how much we need to credit. First mistake right there. Customer already loves me and is happy as he is gonna get some serious cash. I do the account check and reassure the customer I am still working on his credit. I thought giving the credit was gonna be the worst part... boy was I wrong.\n\nI keep reviewing the account some more when eventually I see it. Ooops. The customer was never double charged. I know Im dead now. I just reassured the customer a bunch of times he was gonna get 300+ dollars in credit and now I gotta tell him it was all a fake news.\n\n\nI keep my customer on hold for one more minute while I think of different ways to clean this big pile of poop I just created. \n\n\nI decide I will play it smart. Instead of throwing a cold bucket of water to the customer I will ask more probing questions because I just \"want to fully understand this\" and I will try to make the customer realize it himself. I fail miserably and have to end up telling the customer he was actually never double charged and there is no credit. \n\nI do not think I have to say much more. He does not buy it. The bill did not go up because he got more services, it was because we double charged. The rest of the call was fun. I became the \"greatest and nicest service rep\" according to my customer to a \"waste of my time\" lol.\n\n\nHas this ever happened to you guys? I had a baby messup like this one when I first started taking calls. I ended up giving the credit since it was much more less money and the customer never realized he was wrong. From that day on I just said I would \"check it out\" instead of mentioning the word \"credit\" as I did on that faithful day. ",

        "text": "Background: I work in a call center that does credit/debit card maintenance for credit unions. Transaction history (made using the card), Disputes, Lost/Stolen, Fraud Reporting... But we have zero access to checking/savings account information or balances. We are also not allowed to separate ourselves from the CU of the caller. If they ask us, we are their credit union, not a 3rd party.\n\nI'm usually pretty good at calming down irate or abusive CH's, but this guy started asking me rude and condescending questions in rapid-fire, and when he asked me who pays me and insisted I was a liar, I was officially tilted, and while I remained professional on the call, I just need to get this story out of my system so I can let go of it. Cause I'm still very annoyed.\n\nThe Cardholder (CH) had called because he made a transfer from his account at a different financial institution and had been told by someone at his CU branch that he could expect it to post by today but it wasn't showing up. He was... not happy to learn I couldn't view that information, and in fact, he didn't believe me when I tried to explain why. Because I guess I'd rather be abused than press the magic button to solve his problem in no time.\nHere's a bit of our convo leading up to a supervisor transfer (because of course.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*CH*: I made a payment to this card from my other bank and was told by someone at the branch that it would have posted by now. Find it and tell me why I dont see it in my account yet. \n\n*Me*: Oh, I apologize sir I have a debit card pulled up here but you mention a payment. Were you needing assistance with your credit card payment information or are you referring to a transfer into your checking account?\n\n*CH*: IM NOT TALKING ABOUT A CREDIT CARD OBVIOUSLY I MEAN A PAYMENT TO MY DEBIT CARD.\n\n*Me*: I apologize sir, I'm a bit confused because debit cards do not require payments. Was this a transfer into your checking account and not the card itself that you are referencing?\n\n*(This next bit of back and forth here went on for a good 5 rounds at least)*\n\n*CH*: Obviously I mean a PAYMENT onto my DEBIT CARD which is the SAME THING as my CHECKING ACCOUNT. Find the payment NOW.\n\n*Me*: It sounds like you mean a transfer into your checking account from an account at a different financial institution. I apologize I'm unable to assist with account information. I only have access to the card itself. Any activity linked directly to your account would have to be reviewed by member services and unfortunately they are not available again until Monday, but I can provide you with their phone number. \n\n*CH*: FIRST OF ALL My card IS my account. It's the SAME thing. But you REFUSE to understand that. I need this money NOW. But you probably aren't even with my credit union or you would be able to see my transactions. *((at this point I had already reviewed and confirmed several transactions with him but I guess he had chosen to forget that))*\n\n*Me*: *(Dying inside and ready to move this along)* I apologize sir, as I explained earlier I can only view activity on the card itself and I can assist with reporting your card lost/stolen or compromised and assist with fraudulent activity ON THE CARD ITSELF. For checking or savings account inquiries, which include TRANSFERS or BILL PAYMENTS linked to the CHECKING ACCOUNT using a ROUTING and ACCOUNT number or DIRECT DEPOSITS, anything like that, linked to the ACCOUNT and not made using the LITERAL CARD, can only be done through the Member Services Department or in person at your local branch.\n\n*CH*: SO WHAT YOU MEAN IS YOU ARENT MY CREDIT UNION YOU ARE SOME THIRD PARTY WHO CANT DO SHIT.\n\n*Me*: I am the Cardholder Services Department with your credit union. \n\n*CH*: OH REALLY SO NAME THEIR MAIN BRANCH LOCATION, LIST WHAT CITIES THEY ARE IN, *(this list of questions is significantly shortened for the sake of brevity)* DO THEY WRITE YOUR PAYCHECK TELL ME THEY WRITE YOUR PAYCHECK.\n\n*Me*: Sir, I do not see how that is pertinent to your situation. I am happy to assist you as I'm able to, but I am not going to discuss my personal pay information with you, nor am I required to. I am happy to provide the phone number to Member Services and they can assist with your account inquiry on Monday when they are open again.\n\n*CH continues to bully and quiz me with trivia questions about his credit union until I finally admit we service multiple credit unions even though I'm technically not supposed to*\n\n*Me*: Sir, we do service multiple credit unions, but I am required to identify as the Cardholder Services department for your CU. \n\n*CH*: AHA! I KNEW IT YOU HAVE BEEN LYING THIS WHOLE TIME. HOW DO I GET A COPY OF THIS RECORDING FOR THE CALL. I'LL BE EXPOSING YOU.\n\n*Me*: Uh... I'm not ssure how you would do that sir. Would you like the number to Member Services...?\n\n*CH*: SUPERVISOR. NOW.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLike, OH NO please don't tell the supervisor about how I was DOING MY JOB, they're gonna be so mad! \nAnd as for that recording, I know he wont be able to get one, but I took a lot of enjoyment out of imagining him sharing it with his friends and fam thinking he had some big Gotcha! moment, when in reality he was just throwing a tantrum because he didn't get his way and being a huge asshole to an actual stranger who was being professional and trying to assist. On top of that, not understanding that a debit card, while linked to the checking account is not the only avenue for activity within that account and an utter refusal to believe or comprehend that notion when it was explained to him like he was 5. Who exactly do you think would be exposed here, SIR?",

        "text": "Welp.... I had this absolute gem this week.... *still facedesking*... i wonder if they'll lend me the Hubble space telescope to help me find the logic in this one. \n\nRight now i work for a company that allows customers to buy things from webshops, and they pay us the cash for it at a later date. The company is VERY lenient with the deadlines on which you have to pay before extra charges are slapped on for late payments. In essence you get a full 30 days before the first minor charge gets added to the bill. Then another 14 days before the 2nd charge gets added, and after another 14 days we'll spend another 14 days trying to get you to pay before we hand it over to a debt collections agency. \n\nNow here's the thing with this one... In the Netherlands (not sure if it's like this elsewhere) a company is not allowed to slap on an extra charge UNLESS the consumer has received a FREE reminder to pay after 14 days, then they are required to have another 14 days to pay before they get any sort of charge added. \n\nMe shall be C, and the customer shall be W. (W for walnutbrain).\n\nC: Good morning! My name is CheesyBitterball. What can i do for you?  \n\nW: *Yeah hey, i'm calling about the extra surcharges on my bill! They're unlawfull and you better remove them right this instant!* (already slightly peefed with not getting his name or explaining about which bill this is) \n\nC: Ah okay, good of you to call! Let's see what i can find and possibly do about those, do you have your postalcode 'n housenumber for me? Or perhaps the bill number? \n\nW: *It was a bill for webshop xxxx! Just remove the charge already! You rip offs!\" \n\nC: I'll see what i can do sir, but first i need at list some bit of info before i can even pull up your bill to see what's going on. \n\nW: -heavy sigh, -mumbles postal code causing me to have to ask him for it 3 more times *Jesus, its xxxxxx you dumbfuck*\n\nC: M'kay.... thanks.... Welp i've got your bill pulled up right now. This was an order you placed with webshop xxx in January 2018, and we're now April. We've sent you around 5 reminders, including an automated voicemail message but- \n\nW: - cuts me off mid explanation with a stream of expletives and his tone gets more toxic \" Why didin't you call me then?! You're supposed to notify my that the bill was still open!\"\n\nC: Indeed, which we have sir, as you know we send our reminders by mail. Only before we send it to a debt collections agency you'll get calls from us and letters sent to the address you gave up as the billing adress\n\nW: -another swearword or two \" Are you stupid? The address is my work, i had my stuff delivered there! How was i supposed to know you idiot?! \" \n\nC: Well we're not able to read from a postal code if it's your residence or not sir, besides that we sent 1 opening mail and 3 reminders to your personal e-mail address to inform you.\n\nW: \" Well yeah i saw those but i didn't read them because they were in my spam-box! That's your fault! You should make sure your e-mails don't end up in my spam-box! It's not my responsibility \" \n\nC: We have no control over that whatsoever sir and it's your own responsibility to check your e-mails, whether they end up in your spam-box or not. Unfortunately i'm not able to credit these extra charges as they are completely logical. \n\nW: -launches into a 7 minute rant where i just zone out \" I'm not going to pay these damn extra charges! Screw you! I'll fucking get my lawyer to sue you and i'll make you lose your job! \" \n\nC: Well that's fully within your right of course, I've explained that the charges will not be credited on the bill and that you have to pay them. Do you have any other questions for me? \n\nW: *click* \n\nYeggh... I don't quite understand how people can just forget paying a bill for something they bought over 3 months ago, and then try and find any possible excuse to not have to deal with the consequences. I'm gonna need more beer this weekend! \n",

I’ve heard of these types of calls posted before, nothing is unbelievable in this line of work, but I need to vent how hilarious this was today. \n\nSo I work for a large energy company and currently I am covering an inbound line that deals with customers calling in regarding contact we’ve made via text/letter for them to call in regarding their products - to check everything is okay as we haven’t seen purchases lately and checking they’re avoiding build up of charges etc. \n\nSo we’ll start with Miss A and myself:\n\nMe: Hi you’re through to *company* this is lickmyegg, how can I help? \n\nMiss A: Hi I’ve received a text from you guys about my product and you need to check if there’s a problem? \n\nMe: Okay we are getting a lot of these calls, not to worry I’ll get your account up to look into the reason why. What’s your postcode?\n\nMiss A: *postcode*\n\nMe: And the full address including town or county? \n\nMiss A *proceeds to give me first line, with no town or county*\n\nMe: Town or County? (This is our major point of DPA and I’m used to people being a bit slow on it so I just waited until she said it)\n\nMiss A: *tells me town*\n\nMe: Fab okay, and can you just confirm your full name? \n\nMiss A: Why do you need my name? \n\nMe: Um well it’s for data protection. I need to clear security. I need the account holders full name. \n\nMiss A: Hang on *mutes me*\n\n(At this point as she sounds rather young I assume she maybe needs to get the account holder if she wasn’t on there or check something. No big deal, little break for me)\n\nMiss A: Right you’re a scam. \n\nMe: Excuse me? \n\nMiss A: You’re a scam! I just looked on the internet and YOU ARE A SCAM. You don’t work for *Company*. \n\nMiss A: ITS ON THE INTERNET! \n\nMe: Um... I can assure you I definitely do I’m here right now. I don’t know how I can reassure you but I’m definitely not scamming you. \n\n(At this point she just kept saying you don’t work for *company* you’re a scam. There was nothing I could really say apart from be dumbfounded as she hadn’t done any DPA!)\n\nMe: Okay, there isn’t really much I can do, you called us! I’ll get a manager if you want. \n\nMiss A: Yes please. \n\nSo I phoned our escalations department quickly explained the situation, manager was ready to take the call after literally a minute and her line dropped. \nNoticed she’d spoken to us a fair bit recently so wondered if she’d remembered the hold music and realised how silly she was being or just gave up? \n\nEither way it was amusing, I was only after her name and DOB which is probably on her Facebook anyway. My manager said not to bother calling back as she’d done no DPA. \n\nDid leave a sassy note on her account, hope she mentions it next time and my colleagues can tell her. Overall funny but WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS. Worst part is she was quite young as well. (Id usually associate this would be the case with the older generation)\nAny similar stories? \n\nTLDR: Woman called me, said most sensitive DPA but refused her name etc, proceeded to google the number and call me a scammer. \n\nSorry for format, mobile post! \n\nEdit: I feel the same way about personal finance calls but the calls are always from pay as you go utilities, ie; topping up, so the above is all the DPA we hold and we can’t do anything financial on the accounts. \nI would have happily explained why we sent the messages and letters out without DPA as they’re generic and automated but due to her shouting I decided to escalate as there was no reasoning. \nMan I love *and* hate Data Protection ",

He was so excited and now you've shattered his dreams\n\nR: Ma'am, as I told you, we need the balance paid in full in order for him to perform as we have not received any payment in months \n\nC: But I already told you I'll pay next week\n\nI start getting irritated at this point\n\nR: I understand but you also said you would make a payment \"next week\" every time I called you for the past due balance\n\nC: Student Name will not be returning after this, all you care about is money. \n\n*Hangs up*",

They do. Also, he is calling at 9:50pm so he basically wants me to call a doctor that isn't even on call for a \"personal issue\". Maybe if it was right after they closed and he was nice about it I would've reached out to who he was looking for but at the time he called and with the attitude I wasn't going out of my way.\n\nM-\"OK well I can't do that its almost 10pm and that doctor was not even on call today I can either call Dr Y or leave a message for the morning and have him call you then.\"\n\n\nC-\"So you are refusing to get the dr for me?\"\n\n\n*Another side note,what he is doing is trying to scare me into just calling the doctor but i've doing this way too long and that doesn't phase me*\n\nM-\"I am refusing to page a doctor that's not on call at 10pm at night that is correct. Would you like to speak with Dr Y or should I leave a message for the morning for Dr X.\"\nC-\"Leave a message for the morning and I will speak with the office about you tomorrow,whats your first and last name?!\"\n\nSo I give him my name and operator number and he hangs up.

Obligatory LTL-FTF.  \nI originally posted this at r/talesfromtechsupport , but I thought you may also enjoy it.  \n\nSo this all happened when I worked for a certain ISP as a tier 2 Tech support representative, frankly I don't know a lot about computers but I kind of defend myself as I have general knowledge about how things work and why they work that way (also, you guys are awesome teachers). Anyway, when It came down to modems, routers and internet speeds I was quite good at troubleshooting since all you have to do is follow some simple formulas of **IF--&gt;THEN** and with a lot of bad luck (got very weird cases), some google-fu and a miserable training I'd like to say I gave good, competent and even above average call support.  \n  \nNow, this is where it gets funny: The *site* was/is located in beautiful Mexico City, and I as a Spanish speaker and born in the language have a rather difficult name to pronounce that let's just say is in \"Nahuatl\" (which is a native prehispanic language) so as soon as I started taking English calls it was quite obvious to me that it would be best for me to change my name, and so, I became known as Sirius and presented myself as that at the beginning of every call.  \n\n  \nSee where this is going?  \n  \nSo, insert Angry American Customer *$AGC*, and *$Me* with a problem of intermittent connection in a very saturated area at the end of the call.\n   \n&gt;*$Me:* Well, as I was saying sir it seems that you have an intermittence problem and the only way we can fix this is by sending a Tech over to check your connections.  \n&gt;*ACC:* But I need this now! I know you can fix it from the phone, they have done that before and I have even have Tech visits scheduled and canceled them since the service was restored!  \n&gt;*$Me:* Yes, indeed sir, as I said before the problem you have means that sometimes the internet will work perfectly fine but then suddenly drop its speed or fall death altogether, right now we checked if you have splitters, your physical connections and I even tried my best to configure your wifi since you don't want to use wires to squeeze out every single Mb out of your 3Mb package, but to permanently fix this we need a tech.  \n&gt;*$AAC:* But you're the Tech!  \n&gt;*$Me:* I mean a Tech on the site, sir.  \n&gt;*$ACC:* OK, but the previous Tech I had scheduled was for tomorrow, I'll need him to be here by five since I work from home and I'm losing money!!!  \n&gt;*$Me:* Since you cancelled that appointment even though you were told you shouldn't I can't guarantee We'll have the date available but I'll do my best to get you an appointment as soon as I can.  \n&gt;*$AAC:* You better do! I'm tired of this **THING**!!!!  \n&gt;*$Me* Well the soonest I have available is *insert date a week from the day of the call*.  \n&gt;*$AAC:* WHAT!!!??? I AM PAYING GOOD MONEY FOR THAT SERVICE *(he wasn't)* AND I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CX WITH YOU FOR 20 YEARS *(also not)* AND I EVEN HAVE HAD A GOOD HISTORY *(strike three, you're out!)*, YOU HAVE TO GET ME A BETTER DATE!!!  \n&gt;*$Me:* Sir, while you were speaking it seems that someone has already taken the available space I offered you. Right now I have this *Insert even farthest away date* for the appointment, would you like to schedule it right now to secure it?  \n&gt;*AAC:* You're **SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING** KIDDING!!  \n  \n....  \n  \n&gt;*$Me:* No sir! I'm Sirius!  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n**TLDR: trying to schedule an appointment for an angry cx turns to be a golden opportunity to make a good old fashioned dad joke.**    \n  \nEdit: grammar and spelling, sorry if it is far from perfect but not native speaker.

        "text": "Another telecoms company tale. \n\nI work in my company’s management team, so I take the calls where a customer asks for a supervisor. \n\nThe other day, I got a transfer from a rep who gave me the rundown: a new customer opened their account, went on a business cruise and racked up over $900 worth of international charges. They said they were told our daily travel plan would cover all of the cruise, which isn’t true. It only covered the countries she was going to, and all calls made in international waters are like $2.50 per minute. Data is charged *per megabyte*. \n\nThe players will be:\n\nMe: /u/Majahzi\n\nC: Customer; an early thirties woman\n\nMe: My rep briefed me on your situation. Tell me what’s going on so I can get a full picture. \n\nC: So we started up service in your store a few weeks ago and they told me that your daily travel plan would cover my charges. I just got a text saying that my next bill will be over $1000! This is ridiculous. \n\nMe: Wow that’s terrible. Who was it that told you the plan would be covered? \n\nC: The sales rep. She’s right in front of me. \n\nI personally have a policy to correct mistakes made by employees 100% so the customer doesn’t have to foot the bill. I just need to verify that the mistake was on the company’s end. I tell her that if the rep can make a note in her account admitting to the error, I will credit the charges. A few minutes later:\n\nC: They wrote the note. \n\nThe note says “We told the customer to *call customer service* to add the plan.” Not the reps fault. No credit. \n\nThen her story changed. \n\nC: No, no, no. The rep in store didn’t tell me I’d be covered, the rep on the phone told me! \n\nI *really* wanted to believe her, but it was pretty clear she was lying at this point. I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nMe: So I will have to review the call that was placed that day. You were already credited 20 percent. I will offer you 30% right now, or 100% if the rep lied on this call. If they told you about how much it would be, you get nothing. \n\nC: Fine! Review the call. I will be waiting for my credit. \n\nI reviewed the call. The customer wasn’t the one who called in, it was her husband.  It was 3 minutes long. Halfway through, our representative explained the difference between being on the cruise vs. on dry land and how much the charges were. Went through the plan with a fine-tooth comb and even send a follow-up email. Not only that, but we sent the phone a text saying “Welcome to your cruise. You are going to pay per minute for every call you place. For more info visit our website &lt;link&gt;.”\n\nI call her back. \n\nMe: Hello! This is /u/Majahzi following up about that call review. Turns out it was your husband that called, and not you. \n\nC: I said that to begin with!\n\nMe: Well it seems that your husband didn’t tell you about all he learned on his call before your trip. The representative went over every possible detail on the plan and you even received a text detailing your per-minute rates. These charges are valid. \n\nC: I thought that text was from the cruise ship.\n\nMe: There was a link to my company’s website. \n\nC: Well my husband didn’t hear her properly. \n\nMe: He absolutely did. He even said that he was writing down the information. I could hear his pencil scratching the paper in the background. \n\nC: well this isn’t fair!\n\nMe: please explain to me how fully disclosing the rates to you and your husband several times and then charging those exact rates aren’t fair?\n\nC: I just don’t like the charge. \n\nMe: I wish that my news was different. I really wanted to hear the rep give you the wrong information so that I could credit you. But we told you several times what the costs were and you incurred them correctly. I can’t credit you. Thanks for choosing my company!\n\nTL;DR Customer lied about being told the wrong information about her international roaming charges. I jumped through hoops to prove her right, and even gave her a chance to walk away with charges reduced. She went all-or-nothing and walked away with nothing. ",

Mostly it's just people calling in and pressing 0 until they hear a human voice. \n\nNow most customers are nice, understand that they are really just borrowing our money, and know that it's a good idea to not piss off the employees. I guess this lady just had a screw loose and never got the memo. Keep in mind this is the first ever call I've received where the CM is at this level of just complete denial/unreasonable.\n\nMe: spiel... \"May I have xyzinfo so I can look up your account?\"\n\nCM: (calling from private number so I can't find her account or track her at all) \"I HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH YOU FOR 6 HOURS TODAY! I HAD TO CANCEL WORK AND YOU ALL HAVE JUST BEEN TRANSFERING ME ALL DAY!!\"\n\nME: \"I can hear the frustration in your voice ma'am and from what it sounds like I would be just as angry as you if that happened to me. Can I please have xyzinfo so I can look up your account and help you?\"\n\nCM: \"WELL ARE YOU F***ING READY CAUSE ALL YOU HAVE BEEN DOING TO ME ALL DAY IS TAKING MY INFORMATION DOWN AND NOT DOING SH*T! ARE YOU F***ING READY TO TAKE DOWN MY INFORMATION??!??\" (Proceeds to read off her info at a purposefully fast pace so I couldn't take it down)\n\nMe: \"I'm so sorry that you've been on the phone with us all day, that really sounds just awful... (cm cuts me off)\n\nCM: \"OF COURSE ITS FUCKING AWFUL YOU IDIOT!! MY LIFE IS RUINED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN STUCK ON THE PHONE WITH YOU ALL F***ING DAY!! I WANT TO EAT MY GOD DAMNED DINNER AT SOME POINT. ALL OF THIS FOR JUST $44!! IF YOU WOULD JUST GIVE IT BACK TO ME I WOULDNT BE HERE SCREAMING AT YOU YOU LITTLE SH*T!!\"\n\nMe: (finally understanding what she wants and it's more than likely something we can't do for her. Once a CM and a merchant make an agreement on a price and it gets approved by my credit company, we can't just cancel that agreement.) \"Yes that sounds terrible ma'am and I'm really sorry you've had such an awful experience today. If I could get a different xyzinfo to look up your account...(gets cut off)\"\n\nCM: \"ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME? I JUST GAVE YOU THAT INFORMATION!! WHAT? ARE YOU TOO GOD DAMNED SLOW TO DO THIS RIGHT? (she continues to scream and scream)\n\nMe: (talking over her) \"Alright ma'am in order to help you further I'm going to transfer you to a supervisor\"\n\nAt this point the customer is still just screaming saying things like \"FINE THATS ALL YOU PEOPLE DO IS TRANSFER AWAY CAUSE YOU'RE TOO STUPID TO DO IT YOURSELF!\" yada yada yada. I put her on hold and call into our supervisor line and I'm on hold there for 5+ minutes balling my eyes out praying for a superior to answer the phone. \n\nFinally get one on the line, (tears flowing down my face) I soothe out my voice so she can't hear that anything is wrong and I tell her the CM won't give me information, is on a private line, and that she's stark raving crazy. I bring the crazy lady into the call, I introduce the supervisor, and hang up my end as quickly as possible.\n\nMy trainer was sitting next to me listening and told me I did everything I could, but Jesus. Some people just have something loose in their heads to spend an entire day on the phone over $44 dollars. Guaranteed that lady would've made triple that $44 if she had just gone to work instead of terrorizing my coworkers and I. Like at a certain point I just wanted to tell her to \"f*** off I'm not your therapist lady\"\n\nIs this an abnormal call guys? Like should I be expecting a call like this once a shift or was that a totally coincidental call? I just have major anxiety to go back to work because of it and I'm not sure if I want to stay in this job if I get a call like this every day.\n\n*UPDATE 4/3*: Thank you all for the words of encouragement. You have no idea how much that has helped me. In regards to the company, they do have a policy about the screaming I'm just so new that the policy flew out of my head the moment I heard the first cuss word lol. My team leader pulled the call earlier today and he's going to go over it with me tomorrow to make sure I'm okay/teach me how to kinda ignore it. (He went home sick otherwise he would've gone over it with me today)",

        "text": "Okay so I work for a cable company dealing with billing issues and I take sup calls. The other day I get an escalated customer who is apparently very upset because we somehow put his life on the line. I didn't get much of an explanation before taking over the call other than somehow we tried to kill this guy and he is yelling all kinds of great expletives. From here on out let's call this irate customer Richard. \n\nme - Thanks for holding. My name is John and I was told you requested to speak to a supervisor about an incident you had with us today.\n\nRichard - About god damn time you pick up the fucking phone. I've been trying to get a hold of someone about what your company did to me today and let me tell you I am pissed the fuck off. \n\nme- Sorry about the wait but I would be more than happy to address this issue for you today what exactly happened?\n\nR- I was driving down the road earlier when out of FUCKING NOWHERE, I get a phone call from you guys trying to tell me that I am a few days late on my stupid damn bill. You could have killed me!!! What if I would have wrecked over that call?\n\nme - I realize those calls can be inconvenient at times but they are there as a courtesy reminder on the status of your bill. If you would like I could remove you from the automated call list so you do not get those calls anymore. \n\nR - Shit that is not what I am trying to accomplish. I do not want off the list I just want a $32 credit for you guys trying to kill me and to just not call me while I am driving. \n\nme - ... Weill Richard I can see how this is frustrating and I can send you a pay per view coupon for the trouble you went through today.\n\nR - This is fucking absurd, I am not getting of this fucking phone until I get exactly what I asked for. Now you can either give me my god damn $32 credit or I will call my lawyer and make sure you guys never do business in my town again. \n\nme - I would hate for it to come to that but if you don't mind I have a few questions about the incident if you don't mind. So you mentioned that you want the calls to still come in but just do not want them while you are driving, correct? Well how exactly are we supposed to know when you are driving and when you are not?\n\nR - Well that's not my fucking job to figure that shit out it's yours and you better not get smart with me you son of a bitch.\n\nMe - My apologizes I didn't mean to come off that way I am just trying to make sure I completely understand the whole situation so we can take care of this. So correct me if I am wrong but you got a reminder call about your bill to which you answered while driving and feel like we put your life in danger by doing so. \n\nR - Yep\n\nMe - You have no interest in stopping the reminder calls as they are convenient for you but just want us to implement a system that can tell when you are driving thus not call you rather than just not answering the phone. \n\nR - Shit that's about it but I didn't even answer that damn phone when your system called me earlier. \n\nMe - So exactly how did this put your life in danger?\n\nR - Well if I would have answered the fucking thing I could have got hit by a damn fucking big truck.\n\nMe - Well Richard, we are dealing a hypothetical situation here so my last question is how did we calculate this potential life threat into the monetary value of $32?\n\nR - Fuck you!!!!\n\n*Click*",

        "text": "I can understand the frustration of dealing with some call centers who will transfer you to hell and back, but.....jeez, people.\n\nI just got off the phone with someone who is having some issues with their website. They aren't super critical issues, but it's making the payment page appear a bit wonky. I have told her that I'll need to reach out to our web developer to fix. As in, I DM'ed our web dev while on the call.\n\nThe woman did not want to let me off the phone. Kept asking me if she'd \"have to wait 30 minutes in the queue again\" if I disconnected. Wanted to know if the web dev was looking into it \"right now\". Kept reiterating that it was a critical issue and she didn't want to have to go to someone else. Kept demanding that I remain on the line until the issue was resolved. It took me a good ten minutes to convince her that *I would call/email her back as soon as the web dev had made the changes and I was able to test.* It's part of my job. I'm not going to just leave you hanging. \n\nAt my job, we're encouraged to resolve issues over the phone if we can, but if we've done all we can over the phone, we need to be disconnecting. Especially if it involves waiting for another department to do their part. I've had people get rather aggressive about this, and some people have sat on the phone with customers for over an hour. I've had people tell me that they are not letting me off the phone until the issue is resolved when I've told them we can't fix it and that they'll need to go to X or Y resource instead.\n\nI hate that someone thinks that they can control me in that way. Why? Do these people have literally nothing else to do with their day than sit on the phone and breathe in my ear until I've fixed their problem? When I call any kind of support line, the interaction is kept as efficient and quick as possible. It seems like the customers I deal with just pull out a couch and Doritos with the intention of literally sitting there all day until their problem is fixed. Even if I've told them *I literally cannot help you until you let me off the phone so I can call Resource X or Y.* Or, *I can't help you at all because this isn't my department and I don't have the resources, authority, or ability to help you, so go HERE to someone who CAN.*\n\nLike, if it's an urgent issue I can understand being frazzled/frustrated, but your keeping me prisoner on the phone line is literally preventing me from helping you. If you want to rant and rave for two hours and demand I stay on the line for all of it, how does that help you? Does your ranting make me move quicker? And if it did, have you realized that *I'm still on the fucking phone unable to help you because you'd rather me listen to you scream than actually fix your issue?* ",

That wasn't good enough.\n\n \n\n**Cust:** But I need the money *now*!\n\n \n\n**Me:** Well I'm sorry but I have no way to get the money back to you any faster.

Believe me, my job would be a lot easier if I could refund people immediately, but I have no way to do that.\n\n \n\n**Cust:** But I have no money in my account and I need it! You need to refund it now!\n\n \n\n**Me:** Listen, [company] gains no benefit from holding your money an extra week.

Just refund the money? What are you asking?\n\n \n\n**Me:** I've told you I don't know how many times that I can't give you an instant refund, but you're insisting I have to. Evidently you know more about the computer system I'm using than I do, so please tell me how do I do a refund in one day instead of eight?\n\n \n\n*She ended up speaking to a TL, who reiterated everything I told her.
