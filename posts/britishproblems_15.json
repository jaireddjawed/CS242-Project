They have said they cannot offer me the new customer packages full stop.\n\nIf I actually cancel and tell them to terminate my service, do they actually ring back so I can talk to the tier 2 customers retention team? My worry is they wan't call back and then I'll be without internet for a few days. \n\nIn addition, say I actually cancel and give 30 days notice. If they don't call back, can I stop the cancellation process should I decide I want to return and just accept whatever the existing deal they've offered me?",
