To me, it may only apply to languages that are part of the same branch, so if you're learning for instance romance languages then they could reinforce each other.",

I was never assiduous at language apps, but I'm working over full time on mine now.\n\nI think Duolingo sucks at teaching you languages, and I think spaced repetition in general is inadequate. I wanted an app where I'm *already* speaking the language, no matter my level, and I think Mesmo can do it, but I need to hear from you first:\n\n* What's your unfiltered rant about current language learning apps and methods?\n* What do you wish they would do differently?\n\nI'll be launching early access pretty soon. If you're curious, you can sign up here: [https://link.mesmo.app/early-access](https://link.mesmo.app/early-access).

Some students received only word definitions (group 1), while others received a set of cards with detailed information about the word's usage, its origin and a video about it (group 4). A vocabulary test was given to each group after 7 days.\n\n[Delayed vocabulary test score for students in each of 4 groups](https://preview.redd.it/mjkgw4th6xla1.jpg?width=1503&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0b9f552d87d9e43402377d854d317284fc2fea36)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLegitimately, the more information on the card, the better the students remember the word. \n\nBut here's the interesting thing about Group 2 compared to Group 1. **If we add information about the word's use and origin to the card, the efficiency of learning more than doubles.** This is definitely important when learning words from Anki cards. \n\nI recommend reviewing the study yourself, as there is an example of what the cards looked like.\n\nLink to research: [https://doi.org/10.1080/17501229.2022.2131791](https://doi.org/10.1080/17501229.2022.2131791) (click View PDF)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?",

My main issues are words with a \"r\" in the beginning or an \"rr\" in the middle, so words like \"riktig\" or \"rolig\" sound off and more like \"liktig\" and \"lolig\" (not that extreme but you get the point, I sort of half substitute the r with an l).

I have no current plans to live and work in an arabic speaking country in the forseeable future, i don't have any arabic speaking friends so nothing that might help me \"choose\" other than where i woukd like to visit... Well... I would love to visit many arabic speaking countries :)\n\nAfter dithering around I decided I would most like to visit Oman, so I thought I would aspire to being able to converse in omani Arabic as my current goal.\n\nTry not to despair, language lovers, but what I would like to know is whether egyption Arabic or levantine Arabic is closer to omani Arabic?\n\n I ask this because I have read differing opinions, but that omani Arabic will have less resources available and the language school I can most likely attend teaches MSA, levantine, egyption, and maghrebi....\n\nSo I am weighing up where to start (and maybe adjust my goal!), and feel that committing to one and studying it (for pleasure, via short courses and other available resources in my free time, not as a full time degree) for the next few years is the most important thing to actually learn any Arabic! \n\nMy first question may not have a \"right\" answer but I am interested in people's opinions and reasons for them.\n\nMy follow up question is: or should I not think about it like this and just crack on with learning MSA and start there, like so many people seem to suggest?\n\nThanks for reading :)",

While it can be fun and convenient, it's not enough to develop real-world conversational skills. Duolingo's gamified approach to learning Spanish can create a false sense of progress and doesn't prepare you for real-life conversations.  In fact, some of my students have used Duolingo for years before starting classes with me, yet they barely have an A2 level.  \n\nThat's why I developed my [own platform](https://chidolingo.com/) that focuses on developing conversational skills through real-world interactions. Students have seen significant improvements in their Spanish proficiency and are better prepared to navigate real-life conversations.\n\nIf you're serious about learning Spanish, it's time to step away from the app and engage with the language in meaningful ways. Take a conversation class, listen to Spanish media, and immerse yourself in the culture. Only then will you truly improve your Spanish skills.\n\nHasta pronto, amigos!",

In order to get my highschool diploma, i had to participate in the spanish class of my school (which was fine by me, since the thought of learning Spanish was always appealing to me) and with that, my journey to learning Spanish started there. \"Cool\" i thought, these next three years will surely be fun. \n\nBut holy sh\\*t i had no idea how much joy it would bring me. It wasn't until topics like ***ser vs estar*** or the ***modo the subjuntivo*** chimed into class that i've came to the realization how rich in detail and nuances this language really is. Using estar instead of ser can change the meaning of the entire phrase although you **just changed a word** really is a good example for this.\n\nAnd that's not all. It is also the pronounciation and intonation of the language that is so fu\\*\\*ing  **suave** makes it so beautiful. To me, Spanish is like a stream of  in a mountainous region in the spring: Fresh, flowy and where the sun reflects on the water which flows down a neverending mountaintop. It's vivacious, passionate and just overall a language that is very \"**alive\".** Learning this language has reignited a fire inside myself that i thought had been long lost. Now, i'm in Grade 13, and i'm standing right before our Abitur (name of the final exam in Germany) and of course i took Spanish as my oral exam (the Abitur of my state consists of 4 written exams and 1 oral exam). But that's not all, i'm planning to get into teaching spanish after university here in Germany and i also plan to do a year abroad in Seville during my university years to experience the language \"first hand\" by myself.\n\nSo why this post? Well...i want to say thanks. Thanks to all the native Spanish speakers who promote their language, a thanks to all the great literarists who promoted it in the past, present and future and of course to you, dear spanish speakers of the sub, who have always given out great *consejos* to the people eager to learn your mother tongue (like me!).\n\nI've always laughed when i heard that the Spanish language is more of a feeling than a language, and i always laughed at that. But i get it now. It is something that i hold very close to my heart, like a baby that has to be protected and protecting it i will!\n\nLastly, learning the Spanish language has allowed me to communicate with so many awesome people and has really enriched my live in ways unfathomable, even for myself. I know i will despair, i will fail and i will be on the brink of giving up, but it really is how you say:\"Donde hay voluntad, hay camino\" \n\n ¡ Y joder qué verdadero este frase realmente es!\n\n¡Saludos!",

I know the usual answers that don’t involve money, and I think I’d have an easier time answering the question for myself if I lived near any actual native French speakers. French is a sentimental heritage language for me, but unfortunately in my home state, there are dwindling numbers of aging native speakers. Due to this, it seems the only goal for me is to communicate with natives on the odd trip to France/Canada which I MIGHT be able to make every couple years. \n\nSo it leaves me somewhat curious about whether or not this massive commitment I have made and continue to make is worthwhile in any other regard. I don’t love making everything about money, and I usually try to avoid thinking about the world through this lens. But if I am investing this much time into something I have no choice but to be passionate about, I do wonder if I can market myself with it. \n\nBesides the usual jobs (translator/language teacher/etc.), how have people on this sub managed to turn their veritable language skills into a career? Any ideas on how to maneuver within one’s company? Any positions I might not be thinking of?\nGeneral or specific answers on French or other languages appreciated!",
