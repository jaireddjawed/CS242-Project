It’s about a man and woman who lived in today’s time frame on Earth.  They liked to hike Mount Rainer and discussed new advances in technology.  The woman one day showed up with this new headband that allowed her to ask questions and get answers, sort of like accessing the internet.   At one point she also used it to access a real-time satellite image of her location to help navigate a treacherous part of the hike.  The man did not like this technology.  She talked about how the future would change with new technology.  Eventually she began taking pills that kept her young.  Eventually she lived in an asteroid mansion watching Jupiter but once immortal she roamed the galaxy.  \n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

        "text": "# Introduction:\n\nI had this idea for a theoretical form of legal proceeding that could implement existing science but somehow doesn't exist already. Since it doesn't exist but speculates on top of what already exists using technology, I'd say that this counts as science fiction.\n\n# Concept:\n\nOne inconvenient aspect of trials and court proceedings is getting everyone together in the same room at the same time. On top of this, there can be hearings that are extremely brief, ones that run late, and there's the complications of courtroom security and of transportation.\n\nAdditionally, what if one party's council is rather poorer than the other party's council and managing more cases would be logistically difficult? Therefore, making it possible for some cases to be conducted online would make it easy for attorneys to work on several cases all from the comfort of their office.\n\nWhat if certain kinds of trials could be done online with a secure message board?\n\n# Correspondence Trials:\n\n**Electing to Have a Trial by Correspondence:**\n\nFor a correspondence trial to function, several things must be met:\n\n1. The case must be the type that would go to a [bench trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_trial). \n   1. Since correspondence trials may take longer, but might have more steady progression, it wouldn't be fair to keep a jury together that long.\n2. Both parties must formally consent to a correspondence trial.\n3. The judge overseeing the case must sign off on having a correspondence trial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How Correspondence Trials Function:**\n\n1. All normal steps such as Discovery and so on that would lead up to a trial still are required to take place.\n2. A court official, usually the judge or a clerk assisting them, makes a thread on a secure message board for that court's jurisdiction. This is done using a special, secure browser.\n3. Invitation links to the thread are emailed to the members of both parties. Those who are invited connect to the thread using a special, secure browser.\n   1. All attorneys involved in the case use a special link and log into special attorney accounts so that they may post in the thread.\n   2. Members of both parties, who are not legal council, get their own links and are only allowed to post if they would be allowed to speak in an in-person trial.\n   3. Witnesses may receive invitations to the thread as needed.\n4. Members of the thread make posts, statements, and more as needed throughout the case. \n   1. There is a process of submitting evidence to the court online that still requires tangible evidence to be submitted to the court.\n   2. There are buttons on the posts of attorneys that enable the other side to raise an objection if necessary.\n   3. The judge is able to moderate the thread as necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n* Legal proceedings are less inconvenient to people's schedules.\n* Less wealthy law firms will be able to manage more cases per attorney in a more convenient manner.\n* Diminished chance of in-person conflicts, contempt of court, fights, contagion spread, or other security concerns.\n* The progress of the case is less likely to be as stop-and-go as in-person trials and more likely to be a steady progression of events due to how much more convenient the proceedings may be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n* This may be seen as an, albeit voluntary, abbreviation of Habeas Corpus with all the associated implications.\n* If the whole case is online then there are digital security risks involved that might compromise the case.\n* Parties without access to the internet will be unable to read their own case's thread.\n   * **Solution:** If a party has consented to a Correspondence Trial yet has no internet access, they can request regular transcripts to be mailed to them.",

        "text": "I really like military sci-fi. Really really. I like operators over grunts, and grunts over fleets, but I like it all.\n\nAnd. I'm also nervous about it. Military science fiction is on the rise. If you look through Amazon Prime, you'll find that their Kindle free slush pile is close to 40% military when it comes to science fiction. Some of the factors I'm thinking on... Traditionally, a fair amount of military and ex-military have been writers of science fiction. That number seems to be increasing. Secondly, the reading grade level, or \"literary\" standard is dropping. I'm seeing a fair amount of speculative fiction in general, but especially science fiction, down at a 5th grade reading level. Third, in the tremendous amount of self-publishing that we find out there, no one's taking the time or effort to do things like simple spell checks or proofreads. Fourth is that it's very violent stuff, obvious desensitization going on. There's writing about war and then there's writing about brutality, and then there's free on Kindle. The last thought is that there's a rise of fascism (governance by violence) in the world right now.\n\nI don't know how all this stuff connects yet. But it feels connected, or connectable. Welcome to *my* brain LOL! All this from reading a lot of sci-fi and fiction :-)",

Also, I've got a lot of books already in my audio book collection, so books one is less likely to find on 'the best scifi books' lists are more likely to help me. I've been through so many lists with Hyperion, Foundation, ect. I've heard of them, awesome, they're very nice, but what else is there. \n\nBut don't take that as end all be all. Anything would be awesome and I love all kinds of stories. Thanks folks, you are all awesome. I can't wait to find another favorite",

        "text": "Hello Reddit, could you please help me recall the title of a science fiction story that I read, but cannot remember much about?\n\nThe things I remember:\n\n* Set on a few planets, and a spaceship\n* Spaceship was a cargo hauler of some sort\n* Captain had a facial scar and either blonde or red hair\n* one planet, where a crew is assembled in the beginning is a very cold ice type planet\n* one planet is constantly stormy and maybe covered with water. Some of the people on this planet ride nets. I think the nets could fly, or use wind to move around but they had a human or similar person riding them. One of the captain's old friends or lovers is a netrider\n* Toward the end of the book the crew succeeds or makes money by flying the ship into a cloud of some sort of valuable space stuff that sticks to the outside of the ship and allows them to overcome whatever money conflict they had.\n\nI realize that's not much to go on but I would be very grateful for any help or if any of this sounds familiar to anyone. I have spent some time searching similar phrases to the above online and haven't been able to turn up anything that fits. Additionally I THINK I recall parts of two anecdotes told in the novel either to the main characters or by them.\n\n* One story is told in a conversation between two captains in a bar. It's about a transport captain who transports either an elephant or a whale on his ship, but unwittingly takes on the burden of feeding and caring for the animal afterwards which bankrupts him or at least costs a lot\n* The other story is about how a person fell into a black hole, but due to relativity or something, the insurance company will not compensate his family for his death. From the family's perspective, he's been inside the black hole for many years with no ship or food or air, so he is dead and they deserve hazard pay of life insurance. The insurance company, or possibly his employer, argue that from the man's perspective, due to time dilation or relativity or something, he has only been in the black hole for a few seconds, and is alive and well, so they don't have to pay.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read all of that and double thank you if this rings any bells or sounds familiar!",

Apparently the end of the story allows to have another point of view on the whole story and that is why some people advise to start with this book and others to end with it.\n\nWhat do you recommend and why? (without spoilers if possible)\n\nThank you very much in advance for your precious advices!\n\nPS: Sorry for my English, this is not my native language. I will read the books in French, I'm an avid reader and I know that I will not be discouraged from reading his other books if this one seems less interesting. My question really has to do with the chronology and the importance of this book for understanding the whole story. Thanks again!",

        "author": "FilipMagnus",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/10kxlp7/citizen_sleeper_is_an_amazing_cyberpunk_video/",
        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sslohb7u76ea1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ac53f23e13040e5c1384cfd7cec7b32c02352ed\n\nVideo version [here](https://youtu.be/nDEhuMP-rbQ). \n\nIt is a talented studio that can create a seamless experience out of Citizen Sleeper’s several divergent elements. On the one side, I’m faced with this absolutely adorable character art by Guillaume Singelin–dare I call it cutesy? It’s lo-fi art, the kind you expect to see when you open up a really good study playlist on YouTube. You know the type. Wholesome art, calm lo-fi beats, the kind of music you put on if you’re doing research into the night. The OST itself embraces that lo-fi sci-fi ambience, often straddling the line between serenity and an underlying tension–capturing my mood as I dug deeper into Citizen Sleeper’s fictional world. It’s an unusual aesthetic for a narrative whose subjects are cyberpunk through and through. This title stands out, refusing to fit into the mould of your expectations.\n\nWhat about the gameplay? Every day, the game rolls a set of dice, their number dependent on how well I’ve maintained my silicon-based cybernetic frame. Each die represents enough energy to take up an activity during a given cycle; you can have as many as six or as few as one. Trust me, you don’t want to go with fewer than three–the only time I felt any tension about my fate as a Sleeper was when my body eroded so badly that I only had access to two dice. Options that you might take for granted otherwise are suddenly out of the question, and the struggle to survive is suddenly real and pressing and overpowering anything else. Survival, food, survival, food–and the money to buy sustenance is not always easy to come by, yet alone to get the pill necessary to recover the dice lost by your continuous deterioration. Time is an enemy for the better half of the game. Yet once the myriad questlines begin to resolve and the Eye becomes more familiar, less daunting, events take a turn for the better. For my citizen to make a home of this space station, to set up roots across its complex environment, demands a lengthy process of adaptation. Once this process comes to an end, there is a real sense of accomplishment–the Eye is no longer unnerving, its locations familiar even if not every single one of them is what I would call cozy.\n\nA big part of what sets up the narrative tension is the central conceit that defines the protagonist: a ‘Sleeper’ in the game’s terminology is an imprint of a human mind onto a cyberorganism. Sleepers aren’t free but owned by the corporation that built them, and the humans whose consciousness they bear have signed away their rights to freedom. With this come a bunch of engaging themes waiting to be unpacked, the main ones having to do with what constitutes the human, with questions of law versus justice. How can a conscious being be considered property, whatever a digital signature or the law says? It’s a prism through which to engage with real-world issues, important and uncomfortable ones. I write this text in the shadow of the Qatar World Cup, already infamous for the monstrous exploitation of migrant workers in preparation for the tournament–thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of these migrant workers have most likely died while creating the infrastructure necessary to host the tournament. Any piece of media that can help shine a perspective on real-world problems of such significance is nothing less than art. To any nay-sayers who think games have nothing to say about the world we live in–keep your eyes on the ball.\n\nIn effect, the game is dealing with some heavy topics, but never in a way that overwhelms. Whether I’m helping a single father and his foundling child, going all in to open up shop with a fellow mechanic, or investigating the hidden power relations between the decrepit space station’s corrupt local police-adjacent organization and far-off corporate entities, hope and despair often come crashing down against one another. Hope is more often the victor, even if some quest lines demand an amount of perseverance that pushes more than one character to the edge of despair.\n\nA few thoughts on the writing; it is, after all, the driving engine behind the story. It’s good writing, this, but I am convinced it could have used another editing round or two. Minor mistakes can be found now and then, but that’s not my biggest gripe; no, the issue I have is that some exchanges had a stilted quality about them, where a sentence or two might feel out of place, and so break what is otherwise a powerful sense of immersion. Not many occasions, but some. Enough to take notice, to be drawn out of the artifice that sets the excellent cyberpunk-ish mood of a space station left behind by the devastations of late-stage capitalism.\n\nCitizen Sleeper is not a done tale just yet; its overall arc is to conclude with the release of one more free DLC episodes (two have already been released). What note it ends on, I do not know…but I can’t wait to find out. That said, the game has multiple endings–you can choose to embrace any of them and hold onto a head-canon as to the fate of your Sleeper. My choice was to embrace a life with a family looking for a better future for themselves aboard a seed-ship; it was a bitter-sweet ending, but it was mine. Why don’t you go make an ending your own?",

So it's too neutral in either direction to be classified as even Science-Fantasy. That leaves just supernatural because these things are too outlandish to the be a part of the world's Science system, and too grounded to be magic\n\n\nAm I wrong, no?",

        "text": "Now when I say energy sword I don't mean ones like a lightsaber in Star Wars, I mean something like the Energy Blade from Halo where it's a solid object that is so hot it can slice through heavy Infantry vehicles and even heavy duty steel. Basically anti-material.\n\nNow the way they'll be safely stored is through a heat resistant rubber seath that is fused with smart materials that reduce the effect of heat.\n\nNow in a sci-fi setting these blades will be used for boots on ground combat with Infantry using them for room clearing and Anti-Tank strategy. Now since it's a Sci fi setting that means Exoskeleton suits should be a thing, and there should be two types, one for power (this is for lifting strength and things like breaking through a wall etc) and one for Speed (fast reflexes and about 2 times faster than the power suit)\n\nWell why can't suits have both perks? They run on batteries and if they overpower both parts of the suit, then the battery will overheat and potentially result I a deadly explosion. Speed Exoskeleton suits will have drastically less strength (although still superhuman) than the power suit, and vise versa. Energy Blade Infantry will be armored with the SPEED Exoskeleton suit and they'll catch opposing forces off guard and kill them before they have to chance to shoot\n\nWell why don't Infantry with guns use the Speed suit? Because they don't benefit from it. If they used the power suit, then they can easily carry heavy machine guns and high caliber anti-tank Rifles, meanwhile the speed suit is purely for utility\n\n\nAnd that's how energy swords could work in a setting!",
