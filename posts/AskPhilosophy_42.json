        "title": "Towers of self-reference and \"everything is relative\"",
        "author": "Smack-works",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zjuds4/towers_of_selfreference_and_everything_is_relative/",
        "text": "I want to ask about a specific type of self-reference (or hierarchy of meta-levels). I know, this type of self-reference probably doesn't make sense from the mathematical or formal perspectives. But I think it still matters from the philosophical standpoint. And I think such self-reference can be formalized *in some* theories of self-reference.    \n\n6 examples of this type of self-reference:   \n\n**A)** Imagine that \"everything is relative\" is true.\n\n1. \"Relativity\" is relative too. Maybe something's absolute.\n2. But \"relativity of relativity\" is relative too. Maybe nothing is absolute after all...\n3. And so on. \"Everything changes\" has the same effect. Does it imply that sometimes some things stop changing? And does it stop implying this?   \n\n**B)** Imagine that \"truth = lie\" is true. Informally, this statement is equivalent to \"everything is relative\".\n\n1. It implies that \"you can turn a truth into a lie\".\n2. But it also implies \"you can turn \"you can turn a truth into a lie\" into \"you **can't** turn a truth into a lie\"\".\n3. But it also implies \"you can turn \"you can turn \"you can turn a truth into a lie\" into...\" into...\" \n4. And so on. It gets infinitely nested. [Quine's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%27s_paradox) and [Quine (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) can be related. I guess a similar nested tower can be built out of \"truth is unknowable\" (radical skepticism). \n\n**C)** Imagine that \"God can create anything, including impossible things\" is true. [Omnipotence paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox). Informally, it can boil down to the statements above, e.g. \"everything changes\". \n\n1. It implies God can create a stone she can't lift.\n2. But it also implies God can create the possibility to lift the stone she can't lift.\n3. But it also implies God can prohibit creating the possibility of lifting the stone she can't lift.\n4. And so on. \n\n**D)** Imagine a person pondering \"am I selfish or altruistic?\":\n\n1. \"Maybe I did this selfless act out of meta-selfish reasons. E.g. to build a reputation of a good person.\"\n2. \"But maybe I committed to those meta-selfish reasons out of meta-altruistic reasons. E.g. I decided to be the type of person who wants to build a good reputation because I wanted to actually do good deeds.\"\n3. \"But maybe I committed to those meta-altruistic reasons for meta-meta-selfish reasons. ... \"\n4. And so on. It's equivalent to thinking about free will.  \n\n**E)** Imagine an idealist (**I**) and materialist (**M**) arguing:   \n1. **M:** My reasoning is more fundamental. I can treat your entire thought process as a physical object. *(materialism)*\n2. **I:** My reasoning is more fundamental. Because thinking in terms of physics is just one possible experience. *(meta-idealism)* \n3. **M:** But I can analyze the space of all possible experiences in terms of physics. *(meta-materialism)*\n4. **I:** But thinking in terms of physical \"experience space\" is still just one of possible experiences. *(meta-meta-idealism)* \n5. **M:** But I can analyze any possible model of \"experience space\" in terms of physics. *(meta-meta-materialism)* \n6. Both can continue to go \"meta\" in order to get on top. \n\n...\n\n**F)** You can build similar towers of meta-levels without paradoxical self-reference. For example: \n\n1. Simple propositions are true or false. \n2. Meta-propositions *turn* into simple propositions. \n3. Meta^2 -propositions turn into simple propositions or meta-propositions.     \n4. Meta^3 -propositions turn into one of the types of propositions above. \n5. Meta^4 -propositions turn into one of the types of propositions above.\n6. And so on. \n\n[New riddle of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_riddle_of_induction) is kind of related. Also [Infinite regress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_regress):\n\n&gt; An **infinite regress** is an infinite series of entities governed by a recursive principle that determines how each entity in the series depends on or is produced by its predecessor.          \n\n***\n\nSo, my question is: was such type of self-reference explored in philosophy? How much? Did anybody analyze the connection between the ideas above? If the connection is valid, it seems pretty significant, because it may connect many philosophical topics. \n\nI know that you can write pages analyzing the statements above in terms of \"qualifiers\" and \"quantifiers\" ([like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/5kle92/comment/dbptcxk/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). But I'm interested to know if any philosophical ideas actually come out of it. I know that **W. V. Quine** [proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%27s_paradox#Application) introducing \"levels\" to resolve problematic self-reference. I also know about [Peritrope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritrope). And I understand that if you don't want to consider the idea above, then you can \"destroy\" it by showing that it's not rigorous enough according to some specific standards.",

But if I composed a song where the same key is never used more than once, it just wouldn’t sound good. Why is that? I mean it has quite the variety.

        "text": "Hello!\n\nSo, I'm currently writing a thesis on self-tracking practices and have decided to examine it through postphenomenological lens, because I'm curious about how self-tracking devices mediate people's experiences. I'm currently writing about Don Ihde's embodiment relationship as it relates to smartwatches becoming embodied in people's daily lives. I'd like to include Heidegger's terms \"present-at-hand\" and \"ready-at-hand\" in this context, but I'm not sure if I understand them correctly.\n\nI get the hammer example, but I'm not sure how it relates to self-tracking (smartwatches to be more exact). Smartwatches are ready-at-hand in the sense that people don't actually focus on the technology itself, but rather what can be done with it (checking health stats).\n\nHowever, in the interviews I've conducted, many people express that forgetting to charge their watches becomes a negative experience because they're no longer able to perceive their health. The technology is no longer useful. Could you then argue that the smartwatch becomes present-at-hand? Or am I completely misinterpreting it?\n\nWould really appreciate some help, as I'm completely new to this (English is my 2nd language btw, so sorry for errors!).",

It seems synonymous with the classic pseudo-problem of ''why am I me'' which most philosophers disregard as pointless due to the fact that it reduces to ''Why am I'' which is not that hard to answer.\n\nTo those not familiar, the question is as follows: Of all the subjects of experience out there, why is *this* one—the one corresponding to the human being referred to as Benj Hellie—the one whose experiences are *live?*\n\nAs the wiki article states, a simple response to this question is that it reduces to \"Why are Hellie's experiences live from Hellie's perspective,\" which is trivial to answer. However, Benj Hellie seems to argue that the response leaves something out, and attempts to explains this through a parable:\n\n The parable describes two situations, one reflecting a broad global *constellation* view of the world and everyone's phenomenal features, and one describing an *embedded* view from the perspective of a single subject.\n\nI don't quite understand this, and the initial response seems to make the vertiginous question completely pointless.

But part of me wants to be an international humanitarian aid volunteer for example red cross or unicef because I love reaching out to the community and knowing what is really happening about suffering countries behind the scenes around the world is my dream. But the problem with that is being an international volunteer is really my dream but it's not practical as you don't get paid for doing it (also it's hard to get in my country since I live in a 3rd world) I also love my job as a software quality tester and it has been helping me financially since I am broke and just graduated out of college tryna take care of my mom. That's why I just want to know what your thoughts are about this small dilemma I am facing with my mind and heart.

The creator of the AI, the AI itself, or the user submitting prompts to it? (And if it's the creator of the AI, is the AI itself the artwork in the same way that instructions for a piece of art have been seen as artwork in the conceptual art world?)\n* If the meaning of art is found in its affects (as Deleuze might say) is anything lost by an AI creating art in place of a human? If not, why does this seem to clash so much with our intuition?\n\nI'm not anticipating I'm going to cover all of this to a sufficient level of depth in 2000 words, but anything you can point me to that surrounds these sorts of themes could be really useful (especially academic papers and reliable sources, though I may be able to find some inspiration from less reliable articles etc.).\n\nThanks in advance for any help you're able to give :)",

        "text": "One of Kant's central tasks in the Critique of Pure Reason was to show that synthetic a priori knowledge was possible. Did most philosophers after him believe that he had been successful in this task? If that's too broad, would other later German Idealists like Hegel agree with him? What about more modern philosophers?\n\nFor context, I've only read the Prolegomena and watched some lectures on Kant a long time ago. But it sort of came to my mind that I never found out if people had agreed he actually accomplished his goal. Just from the outside looking in, it seems like his Copernican Revolution and Idealism were more influential.",

        "text": "I was reading a work by Haugeland and he talks about formal system need to employ truth-preserving rules and then drops the subject. He calls this a *semantic* property, which seems somewhat strange to me. Intuitively I would think of truth-preserving rules as the logical connectives which are defined syntactically? \n\nAnyway, my real question is where I can find more information on this topic? For instance, is truth preservation something prescriptive? For instance, is it how we ought to think? If so, why ought we to think this way? Are logical terms used because the world is logical? Does our logical reasoning work when we think about the world because *it* follows logical patterns? Or is truth preservation descriptive? Is it describing the rules we use in thinking about things? \n\nI'm not totally looking for answers but sources where I can investigate this further. It's somewhat tricky to find the right material because alot of what I find goes straight into the details of symbolic logic or gives a canned definition of validity. There is probably something on SEP but i'm not sure what to search for. \n\nAny help is appreciated.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zieomt/is_mathematical_platonism_a_defensible_position/",
        "text": "# Background\n\nMathematical Platonism is the name for the set of philosophies of mathematics that assumes that when we do math we are notating the existence of some \"real\" form of math beyond what's in our head or on paper. In other words, when we notice that things like numbers or logic seem to describe and predict the nature of reality we assume that this is because we are observing some form of ideal or structure which we can think about using specially developed languages. This is contrasted with philosophies like formalism or intuitionism which argue that it's all in our head or is the consequences of non-mathematical properties of the universe.  \n\n\n# Problem\n\nPlatonism makes a lot of intuitive sense to me as a philosophy and possess a lot of aesthetic appeal. Considering that the laws of physics, chemistry, and so on are all mathematically expressible and seeing that logic manages to predict things that other methods don't the most reasonable assumption is that it's because it's somehow \"real.\" However having studied math more intensely and as of late having read more about the philosophy of mathematics I've found several places where the intuitive nature of this philosophy grinds up against the results of mathematics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems: Any set of mathematical rules (axioms in technical parlance) which can make statements about its own relations or structures (second-order logic) will produce statements which can't be proved true and can't be proved false. In other words, if the universe does follow a set of mathematical rules it is not a set of rules that divides mathematical statements into true and false; there must be statements which are neither. \n2. Overlapping Axiom Sets: It turns out that it's possible to rigorously define pretty much all mathematical concepts in multiple ways, meaning that if there is a single set of rules that the universe follows it may or may not be the one we're using to do math.\n3. The Axiom of Choice: The axiom of choice is the assumption that you can always choose at least one element from any collection of non-empty sets, if there are some number of pairs of shoes I can always pick at least one shoe from each pair, even if there's infinite. This is necessary to large swaths of modern mathematics and makes intuitive sense but it also turns out to imply the existence of non-definable objects. For example, the Banach-Tarski Paradox is a proof that an (idealized) ball can be cut into five pieces which can then be reassembled into two balls of precisely the same size and this proof relies on the Axiom of Choice. As if this weren't enough four of the five pieces in question are solids which have no volume, an object that can't be rigorously defined, in other words, I am asked to accept that there are solids with no volume *and* that I can't construct one.\n\n# The Kind of Answer I'd Like\n\nGiven the problems outlined above it seems reasonable to simply cast aside mathematical Platonism and move on to a different kind of philosophy. However doing so also requires me to abandon much of what made mathematics beautiful and much of the context which gives mathematics relevance to the rest of the world. I'd like to understand how modern-day Platonists are capable of squaring the above circles, any recommendations for readings on the subject would be appreciated as well as any direct answers to the problems in question.",

But that is absurd. \n\nI assume some sort of emergence is needed to explain this but the common examples don't seem credible. Parts can have different properties than their wholes. However, at all levels of complexity or simplicity nature follows the same general laws; chairs are mostly matter while atoms are mostly empty space. But an atom is bound by the conservation laws just like the chair is. It seems strange to me that the brain could have properties (like intentionality) that the matter in principle could never have (intentionality) even if one allows for emergence. Where am I going wrong in your opinion? Since I seem to have arrived at the conclusion that humans dont have goals or intentions.",

The different quantities of commodities of the same kind, produced in different countries in the same working-time, have, therefore, unequal international values, which are expressed in different prices, i.e., in sums of money varying according to international values. The relative value of money will, therefore, be less in the nation with more developed capitalist mode of production than in the nation with less developed. It follows, then, that the nominal wages, the equivalent of labour-power expressed in money, will also be higher in the first nation than in the second; which does not at all prove that this holds also for the real wages, i.e., for the means of subsistence placed at the disposal of the labourer.\n\n&gt;But even apart from these relative differences of the value of money in different countries, it will be found, frequently, that the daily or weekly, &amp;tc., wage in the first nation is higher than in the second, whilst the relative price of labour, i.e., the price of labour as compared both with surplus-value and with the value of the product, stands higher in the second than in the first.\n\nMy best explanation so far is the following. I can break it down point by point.\n\n&gt;But the law of value in its international application is yet more modified by the fact that on the world-market the more productive national labour reckons also as the more intense, so long as the more productive nation is not compelled by competition to lower the selling price of its commodities to the level of their value.\n\nTranslation: More intense labor produces more commodities and more value in the same amount of time, while more productive labor produces more commodities but the same amount of value.\n\nHowever, this only translates to prices being lower from more productive labor when they are forced lower by competition, which only applies slowly in an international market with different levels of industrial development.\n\nTherefore, more productive labor \"reckons\" as more intense labor, producing more commodities and selling them above their value, as if it was the result of more intense labor.\n\nThis is a modification on the law of value, which implied that prices should tend to reflect their values.\n\n&gt;In proportion as capitalist production is developed in a country, in the same proportion do the national intensity and productivity of labour there rise above the international level.\n\nTranslation: Capitalism leads to higher levels of productivity and intensity of labor above the international level. Capitalism is constantly trying to rework the labor-process to produce more surplus-value by increasing intensity and productivity.\n\n&gt;The different quantities of commodities of the same kind, produced in different countries in the same working-time, have, therefore, unequal international values, which are expressed in different prices, i.e., in sums of money varying according to international values.\n\nTranslation: When the same commodity is produced by a more capitalist country then, it will have a different value than it does in other countries, since its labor is more productive, meaning it took less socially necessary labor time.\n\nThe value of these commodities produced by more capitalist countries will therefore be lower.\n\nThese unequal values is expressed as different prices, making these same commodities cheaper in more capitalist countries.\n\n(This is where things start to trip up, because I thought the point was that, because more productive labor wasn't facing as much competition, it *wasn't* changing its price to reflect its value? That commodities are being priced above their value? I suppose it could be both, with commodities being cheaper, but also priced over their value.)\n\n&gt;The relative value of money will, therefore, be less in the nation with more developed capitalist mode of production than in the nation with less developed.\n\nTranslation: Because things are more expensive in nations with a more developed capitalist mode of production, the relative value of money is less.\n\n(This is the more obvious 180. I thought we were saying things were cheaper in more capitalist economies? We were just pointing out how capitalist economies had higher productivity and intensity. My best guess is that Marx might actually be saying that, because commodities are being priced above their value, it is as if the value of money had decreased.)\n\n&gt;It follows, then, that the nominal wages, the equivalent of labour-power expressed in money, will also be higher in the first nation than in the second; which does not at all prove that this holds also for the real wages, i.e., for the means of subsistence placed at the disposal of the labourer.\n\nTranslation: Because things are more expensive in more capitalist nations, wages need to be higher so workers can afford to buy their means of subsistence to stay alive and working. But this higher nominal wage doesn't necessarily mean a higher real wage. Workers in other countries may be paid less, but life might also be less expensive.\n\n&gt;But even apart from these relative differences of the value of money in different countries, it will be found, frequently, that the daily or weekly, &amp;tc., wage in the first nation is higher than in the second, whilst the relative price of labour, i.e., the price of labour as compared both with surplus-value and with the value of the product, stands higher in the second than in the first.\n\nTranslation: Even if nominal wages are higher in more capitalist countries, capitalists frequently might find the price of labor to be higher in less capitalist economies, since they are able to produce less surplus-value due to their lower intensity and productivity.\n\n(I think I have this claim right, since it lines up with Marx's follow-up examples of English workers spinning cotton or building railroads. I guess Marx considers this as an explanation for why capitalists don't simply shift all production to where labor is cheapest? Although I feel like he's glossing over the role racism or colonialism could play for why non-whites might be paid less.)\n\nAny help here would be greatly appreciated!",

I realized that if I want to get into a good institute, the opportunity cost during undergrad will be extremely high. I get so panicked when I get a B+ on my paper as all the efforts might take me nowhere in the end. I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask questions like this, but for those who work in philosophy, how do you know if you're good at philosophy, and that you will be capable of working in this field? And perhaps, any advice on how to improve understanding and writing skills? Thanks a lot in advance.",

(I think the definition of free will being invoked here is: \"if one could've acted differently than how they did, free will exists.) \n\nSubjectively, the premise of the above argument seems true to me. If I pay careful attention to my experience, I do find this to be the case indeed. So, please post any rebuttals to this premise. If you think that the conclusion doesn't follow from the premise, please argue why as well.\n\nOne might think that the premise is not true because \"I can choose to think about mangoes as my next thought\", but in that case this premise just goes one step back in time as you didn't choose to think your present thought \"I will think about mangoes as my next thought\". He's not saying that our next thought can't be dependent on our current thought (So, I guess it's not strictly true that I can't \"know\" what my next thought is going to be, because many times as in this example, I can know that my next thought is going to be about mangoes), but that subjectively each thought seems to come out of total darkness. \n\nSo I guess a better way to frame his argument would be: \"Because each thought seems to come out of total darkness, there's no free will\".",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zhv0z5/morality_of_taking_money_for_government/",
        "text": "In Georgism, government administers a tax that charges 100% of land rent to all property owners. In one version of the theory, this tax is taken because all people own all land equally and the correct amount of compensation for someone using land we all own equally is that they pay all land rent. In another version of the theory no one owns the land, and this compensation is due for excluding others from land use. Here it’s harder to show that compensation should be 100% of land rent but there is a reasonable case that compensation should be capped at that, and some convincing arguments it will be at least that. The general point here is that government collects a specific pool of money that is actually due to all people as compensation for their land rights or exclusion from land.\n\nGeorgists generally argue it’s acceptable to use this pool of money to pay for government but I have difficulty accepting this argument. In my view if we want to fund government we can do so by instituting a specific tax that pays for it which we haven’t done by collecting compensation due to others. Hiding in taking the money out of the compensation is a poll tax.\n\nThe simplest way to see this is to divide the process into two stages: in the first we collect and distribute compensation and in the second we fund government through a tax. Because taking money earmarked for equal distribution among the people for government takes from everyone equally it is equivalent to applying a Poll/Head Tax to everyone in the country in stage two.  This Head Tax may be less bad than historical Head Taxes because it comes with money to pay it but it is still an extremely regressive tax.\n\nSo I think that Georgists haven’t actually solved any problems about how to fund government. It seems to me they dodge the question entirely by pretending there is no stage two. I agree that if government had a moral claim to some of the LVT money there would be no stage two needed and they could just take that money. I just think absent the moral claim to the LVT paying for government requires determining the correct taxes to do so. Is my argument reasonable or am I missing something?",

I.e. following one form of \"self-deception\" leads to starvation, where the other leads to... arguably a problem that mostly exists for onlookers who don't accept your identity? \n\nThen there is also the point that gender self-id just may not constitute a false belief, like an anorexic patient believing they're overweight does. (I don't know the arguments regarding this question either, so any sources are much appreciated).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch very thanks in advance, and sorry if this has been asked a bunch before.
