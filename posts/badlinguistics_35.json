I don't really care, I personally don't bother to correct people because why does it matter, but why is it considered bad form?\n\nOne personal example: I use the word \"ignorant\" in the way I was taught, simply meaning to lack knowledge or information on a subject. However, it's used in common form with a negative connotation as an insult., more along the lines of the way stupid is used. Very similar to the literally/figuratively switch that's going on. Is it just the natural evolution of language, and people who hold on to \"old\" definitions are luddites?\n\nI hope I'm not sounding too stupid here, I have no training in linguistics. I am truly *ignorant* here. Thanks for the help.",

Probably once every 1-2 months a story pops up about english speakers being discriminated against, as it is the only french province, other than New Brunswick, which is bilingual (Officially).  How true these stories are other than good headlines, I really have no idea.  Not really interested in going into that sort of business.  The comments are always fun to read though.\n\nOn a story about a person who spoke english to a coworker in Quebec, and the management posted a sign stating all conversations must be in french, specifically naming her:\n\nA person stated that they wished they started learning french before Grade 9, as by then they couldn't get a good grasp on concepts you would have learned in earlier grades.\n\nOne commenter didn't share this sentiment:\n\n\"No, an extra 9 grades wouldn't have helped. I was forced into french classes as soon as Grade 1, and by high school, I never got higher than a 60% in french classes. It's a horrid language. While I understand and can speak it, the simple fact that they have 16 verb tenses makes the language completely foolish. You CANNOT have more than 3 verb tenses, there is no other time periods beyond past, present, and future.\"\n\nAnd further descriptions of how he ignores anyone speaking french to him.\n",

It supports the Christianization of Tamil culture and offers a doorway into Indian politics for right-wing evangelican American politicians and western geo-political strategists.   \n\nHis sources for these claims? His ass. \n\nAccording the author any western research associated with India is going harm national identity of Tamils. \n\nAccording to him anyone who identifies Dravidian language as different from Sanskrit is trying to undermine the identity of Tamilians. \n\n&gt; Once a linguistically separate Tamil identity is created, the ground is set to promote a Tamil transnational movement. Activists are nurtured to exacerbate the centrifugal forces in India. Western money flows in, and scholars from West have strategic links in the conflict zones, where they covertly or openly support secessionist movements. Proselytizers support these movements and utilize Tamil studies in the West to link evangelical Christian institutions and Tamil identity.  \n\nWhat are those research actually about? Trying to create a database of Dravidian words and their etymologies. \n\nThis author also uses Dravidian and Tamil interchangeably, while ignoring Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. This is due to the fact that the most recent civil war is the region involves Sri Lankan Tamils and is using this tragedy to peddle his insane ramblings.   \n\nThe result of this book? [From the website of SARVA project](http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/sarva/entrance.html)   \n\n&gt; NOTICE: These, our purely scholarly goals have recently been attacked by non-scholars in print and on the internet as a \"pretext for shifting the argument from linguistics to politics, so that 'language contact' is rephrased in terms of 'victimhood' and 'oppression'. ... Just as in the 1960s when The Dravidian Etymological Dictionary was co-related with heightened Dravidian separatism on the ground, one can now see different tribal identity politics intensifying with the intellectual support of this project.\"\n\n&gt;Nothing of this is true. We protest against this uninformed, ridiculous, yet libelous attack on a purely scholarly project. Specialists are involved in similar projects, for example about prehistoric European languages, without such uninformed political attacks.\n\n&gt;We (Southworth, Witzel, Stampe) will continue to add to this dictionary, undeterred. \n\nThis is just 2 pages of the fucking 650 page book!!!\n\nI see people asking the reason why people take language seriously, well this book is a fodder those nationalists who see conspiracy in everything that is not \"theirs.\" Just look at the reviews for the book and see the virulent fan following this one has managed to achieve. \n",

Some points from the video for those of you who don't understand Russian:\n\n* In some number of years, there will be a single main Slavic language and other ones will only exist as an academic interest.\n* Russian is the ancestor language for at least all the Eurasian languages.\n\nHere's some of his examples to demonstrate how English has its origins from Russian. He notes that the \"s\" in these words is not a part of the root, since the Russian \"с\" is something that can be present or not in words like портить/спортить.\n\n* small - малый (maly)\n* stare - таращиться (taraschitsya)\n* skate - кататься (katatsya)\n* stress - трястись (tryastis)\n* spoil - портить (portit) (since \"l\" and \"r\" are interchangeable)",
