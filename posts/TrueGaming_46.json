        "text": "Fighting games are stuck in a slightly elitist niche at the moment, because they are games you need to deliberately train in, to really enjoy.\n\n\nUnlike most other genres of games, it's much harder to gain skill organically by just playing, especially if we're talking singleplayer modes.  (This is relevant because it's only reasonable to play online in the most popular 2-3 games.  Unless you live in Japan, I guess.)  It's much harder to be motivated to play arcade mode over and over, compared to something with a long story and proper progression.\n\n\nCompare to a beatemup like Streets of Rage, or a character action game like Devil May Cry.  In a beatemup, you fight hundreds if not thousands of enemies before you reach the end of the game.  The enemies are simplified and quick to dispose of, and gradually increase in difficulty and complexity.  You gain abilities gradually (or are introduced to them gradually.)   All of this is a subtle way of gently making you familiar with the skills needed to play the game.\n\n\nBack to fighting games.  Most fighting games have an arcade mode or story mode.  In these modes you get like, 8 - 12 fights max?  (And some of the recent ASW FGs dont even have gameplay in the story mode!)  The game doesn't introduce you to mechanics gradually, and the difficulty progression only exists by dumbing down the AI at the start and then making it cheat later on.   The old model of quarter-eating arcade games isn't optimal for home gaming.  Some FGs have a campaign mode of some sort.  But usually those feature full matches as well, which is a bit more tedious than the quickly-killed beatemup enemies.\n\n\nSo, in my opinion, if FGs want to broaden their market, they really need to incorporate a beatemup style single player mode.  I've personally seen this done twice, once well and once badly. \n\n\nDone well, it was Guardian Heroes.  I loved that game!  As a fighting game it was terribly balanced and simplistic, though.   But you can use it as a model of an excellent beatemup that theoretically could have a decent fighting game attached to it, if the devs wanted to.\n\n\nDone poorly, it was Guilty Gear Isuka.  I didn't play that game for long (like maybe 30 minutes!) but I felt it was a poor attempt to crowbar a fighting game into a beatemup.  To turn your character to face the other way, you needed to press a button.  This was a very unintuitive compromise to make the \"hold back to block\" FG mechanic work in a beatemup.  Better to have a block button like Guardian Heroes, or some sort of lock-on button.\n\n\nThere's parallels for this in other genres, with RTS, FPS and other games following the \"long campaign + multiplayer\" model.",

        "author": "ElvenNeko",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7oc2xe/an_ultimate_pvp_turnbased_tactics_game_concept_to/",
        "text": "Currently there isn't many places to go if you love turn-base tactics and want to play it against other players. There is few good games, a bit more average ones, but the turn-based tactics genre are nearly extinct among online games. Maybe we will never see something great, big and supported for a long time coming out, but at least we can dream about how it could look like.\n\nHere i created a random concept of a trully big tactical online game and would like to discuss it with other players who love turn-based combat, and also to listen to their ideas, to find out what they always wanted to play in this genre. This is not a marketing research or anything like that, just a casual talk about things that most likely will never happen. \n\nSo, here is the game concept. I call it \"paradise tactics\" because if that kind of game existed - it would be a pure perfection to me, and i would spent most of my time playing it &gt;_&lt; \n\n**Battle system**. \n\nThe main problem in turn-based game - is how to make the battle system fair for a lot of players present of the same field, to prevent someone from dying before he even makes his turn. Here all people will have around 1 minute to decide on their turn, and then all of them will move at the same time. How it will work? Ap-cost dependant, here is an example: \n\n1) You need to spent 2ap to run behind solid cover, your opponent needs 3ap to execute a shot. You will get behind the cover first, and his shot will hit cover instead of you. \n\n2) Reverse situation - you need 3ap to reach the cover, he needs 2 to perform the shot. You are getting shot while running, and only then you reach the cover. \n\nThis kind of a system will not only give each player a fair chance to participate in fight, but also will greatly reward the prediction skill. You can't see your enemy, but you know he will enter certain door soon? Fire at the enterance or throw the grenade there. You know your opponent has only several bullets left in his revolver, and you know how much ap he spends on each shot? Chose \"wait\" option to recover your stamina and spent that amount of ap on waiting, and then chose to go out and shoot him when he  realoads. Will your opponent just stand behind cover and wait for you to waste bullets? Take a risk and run to him, if you sucseed - he will die without even resisting. \n\nIf enemy is in line of sight, you can target any specific body part - if you sucseed in doing enough damage it will cause traumas like being unable to carry two-handed weapons, being contused, etc. However, shooting at the body parts protected by armor pieces will cause little effect, not to mention that torso is the easiest object to hit - so chose your target wisely! \n\nStamina: regular movement (jogging) does not take too much of it, so if you stop once in a while it will be fine. However, it is being used a lot with jumping, running, climbing, etc type of actions, and with lot stamina mssing your running distance is decreased (takes more ap on each step), your total amount of ap in next turn are reduced, as well as your accuracy. Resting (spending ap to stand still) is nessesary to regain it, and long runs should be used only when it's really needed - for example, if you rusing the enemy, better make sure he dies right away, because if he does not - in next turn he will have more ap than you do. \n\n**Characters**.\n\nThere won't be character skill progression to keep fights fair (but that is a subject to dispute), but there will be many character archetypes with unique appearance (with ability to customize it with lots of cosmetic items) and abilities to bring some variety and unique approach to the combat. For example: \n\n* Augmented person. Passive: his improved bodyparts allow him to sprint, climb, jump trough windows and perform other actions like that with lesser ap and stamina cost. Active: \"Calculated\" - next shot will have 100% hit chance. \n\n* Humanoid wolf. Passive: scent of blood, allows him to see the tracks of any wounded person. Active:  \"Devour\" - takes a piece of the fallen body to improve his own stats. \n\n* Soldier. Passive: forged in battle, it's a lot harder to damage his bodyparts. Active: \"Adrenaline rush\", causes all shots cost 1 less ap for this turn. \n\n* Catgirl. Passive: splendid hearing, all sounds (footsteps, shots) are a lot easier to hear and pinpoint the direction. Active: \"Cat's reflex\" - using the whip to perform  the jump for several titles (in any direction, can be used for climbing too), avoding any damage caused during the jump, except explosions. \n\n* Robot. Passive: hidden weapon in his arm that can be loaded with 9mm bullets. Active: \"stun grenade\" - using his arm gun to launch the stun grenade, blinding enemies for the next turn. \n\n* Dwarf. Passive: packrat, can carry a lot more weight with him. Active:  \"Riot shield\", placing a full cover on the ground. \n\n* Mechanic. Passive: tinkerer, his traps are more effective. Active: \"Scout drone\" - places a drone that can travel the map, place trap and shoot tracking dart at the enemy. \n\n* Loly. Passive: petite, allows to use half-covers as full covers, less penalty chance for being hit on the move. Active: \"Adorable\" - causing all enemy attacks to do reduced damage for 1 turn. \n\n* Zombie. Passive: already dead, taking less damage from all sources. Active \"Play dead\" - looks like a random dead character to other players, camuflage removed with any action. \n\n* Zombified loly catgirl cyborg. Oh... well, i probably went too far with this one, have to stop. \n\n(All that are just the first ideas i came up with when i was writing this text, they serve only as and example of possible class variety)\n\nIt's also possible that each character will be able to unlock serveral passive and active abilities, but take just one of each in the fight. \n\n**Game modes**. \n\n1) **Battle Royale**. Players start naked in random spots of the map, having to look for crates with random gear - traps, armor, weapons, supplies. Stuff are fully randomized, so having a full set of armor and grenade, being naked with ak, or have nothing but knife and traps are expected. There is an npc enemies patrolling the map - defeating them might give you some stuff, and will allow you to loot nearby crates safely, but sounds of combat can attract enemy players - so sneaking past them or just running away is a good option too. There will be several points of interests on each map, such as security room - while you are inside it, you can see all the areas where security cameras are placed (if players do not break them), or storage with good gear spawns that can be blown up with explosives, for example. \n\nThere will be two ways to limit the map: \n\n* Certain areas of the map are marked as dangerous. After some time they are filled with gas that will slowly kill anyone inside them.  On the arctic type of maps gas replaced by opened dome, that lowers the temperature, and in space maps it's the air being sucked from red areas. \n\n* Certain areas of the map are marked as dangerous. Boss enemies spawn there and will go directly for the players in those areas. You may kill one of them, but more will come. \n\n2) **Treasure hunt**. Same as Battle Royale, but without limiting the map, and with different win conditions: you must find a certain item among random loot, and extract it to the one of two exits. After item has been picked up, all players recieve a warning. After tree more turns last known location of the carrier are revelaed to all players (not his current position, but last know from previous turn). \n\nIt's possible that players will be able to bring their own gear to this mode, as well as keep all the gear they manage to find or take from the opponents. \n\n3) **Teamfight**. Certain amount of points are chosen - each gear piece cost some, you need to ballance your setup within the limit.\n\n4) **Duel.** Same as teamfight, but, you know - 1v1. And also 2v2. There can be even a specific type of duel where each player controls several characters at once, and turn time are increased. \n\n5) **Siege**.  Each player can use different modules to craft their own base, pick a visual style, set the deffecnces and valuable objects, place traps. Once base is operational other players can attack it once in a while. If player are online - he can help to protect it, if he is not - it's up to his deffence systems. Base parts can be earned only trough gameplay, cosmetic appearances (underground lab, ancient castle, etc) can also be bought from cash shop. \n\n**Tanuts.**\n\nThere will be an ability to use taunts you unlocked with a specific action (shoot, personal ability, victory and defeat poses), but with limited uses per battle. \n\nThe end. So, what do you think about that? \n",

        "text": "Hiya /r/TrueGaming! \n\n[Earlier, there was a post asking for advice on the CSS of the subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7mrt13/new_year_new_sub_stage_1_css/) If you haven't already checked that out, please do so and give us feedback on it! \n\nThe next step in the process of changes is work on fixing the rules, which is currently being held together by some tacks and painter's tape. Good for a poster on a wall, awful for a subreddit of over two hundred thousand as of the new year! We'd like to thank each and every one of you guys for making the subreddit a wonderful place to come and visit and for using the report button ever so vigilantly. \n\nAnyway, let's get right to the new proposed set of rules. What you'll notice right away is that they're not all over the place and much more condensed. We are now opening up the subreddit to link posts and also the infamous \"no list posts\" rule will be abolished. We have seen numerous posts that break that rule but otherwise produce good discussion and we are always sad to have to remove them (and sometimes don't). \n\nHere are the new proposed rules: \n\n**All posts must be about gaming**  \nThis also includes “meta discussion” (including, but not limited to, the ethics of certain aspects of sale such as lootboxes or microtransactions)\n\n**No memes, image links, or blatant circlejerk**  \nThis is a subreddit for discussion, enough said.\n\n**Title must match topic of discussion**  \nThis rule is two-fold. For link posts, posts must use the article title and/or include a relevant quote about the topic of discussion. For self-posts, users must know what they are getting into when they click on the post. (For example, when the title is about Halo, the body of the post shouldn’t be about Mario)\n\n**Posts must include discussion to kickstart the conversation**  \nUnlike /r/askreddit, we want our users to include their personal thoughts into their questions. Empty posts with nothing in the body will be removed.\n\n**No purchasing advice or game sale threads**  \nThere are numerous subs for that already, such as /r/gamedeals or /r/shouldIbuythisgame.\n\n**These types of posts should have prior consent by the moderators before being posted**  \n * Giveaways  \n * Surveys/Studies  \n * Donations  \n\nWhat do you think of the new proposed rules? What should be changed/amended and also what should be added? \n\nThese rules won't be going into effect for some time until you guys, the users of the subreddit, are satisfied with them.\n\nEdit: there's some good discussion in here already! There will be another post with the second draft of the rules with all your input soon, but for now you guys can continue discussing more in this post ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7o8i06/are_you_a_picky_gamer_how_do_you_find_games_you/",
        "text": "**tl;dr: if you're a picky gamer, how do you find games that you like?**\n\nI love games. Or, more accurately, I love *certain* games. Dark Souls 3 and Mass Effect 3 are my favorite games of all time, yet they're wildly different.\n\nThe challenge of DS3 matters less to me than its honesty. The enemies can do what they can do, they don't cheat, they don't overwhelm you with bullshit you never saw coming, and they don't beat your ass in a cut scene. When you lose, it's your fault. Likewise, there's something true about the controls: each trigger controls a different hand and if I hit the trigger three times, I'll attack three times. Instead of panicky button mashing, I have to keep my head and calmly, quickly act. There are enemies that require patience and there are enemies that require aggression. It's up to me to learn their tells, their strengths, and their weaknesses. I wish it weren't such a bleak game, but the collaborative multiplayer gives me the opportunity to make other players' lives a bit easier.\n\nME:3, on the other hand, blends RPG-lite elements with fast-paced third-person combat and a rich story I found utterly engrossing. I loved Commander Shepard and her companions and found myself getting choked up at the end. The combat was awesome in a very different way; I loved its fast pace, the fuck-you moment of finishing an enemy with my omni-blade when my assault rifle ran dry, and the tactical depth of controlling my entire squad.\n\nI liked Last of Us, Tomb Raider, XCOM, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and a few others well enough to play them once but have no desire to ever touch them again. Overwatch lost its appeal after a couple weeks. \n\nEvery other game I've tried recently has just rung false. MGS:V combat felt like listening to metal without a drummer, it suffered cutscene overload, and I couldn't make it past the whole Quiet thing. Witcher 2 and 3 both frustrated me with neat-looking but sloppy combat. Skyrim took that to an extreme. GTA:V was too inconsequential for me to enjoy. Nier: Automata taught me that I hate platformers, even ones praised for their combat (I ragequit about an hour in). Uncharted was too scripted and literally nothing in Assassin's Creed 3 worked for me.\n\nI could go on.\n\nIf you're a picky gamer, how do you find new games that you like?\n\nI read through descriptions and reviews and find myself despairing at most of them. When I finally do pull the trigger on something that looks fun (Horizon: Zero Dawn promised challenging combat and a compelling story, didn't force me to play as a scruffy male anti-hero, and had robot dinosaurs) it ends up boring me to tears (the combat was dull and it turns out I just don't like vast open worlds). My approach isn't working.",

        "text": "Just curious if anyone else has an \"evil\" streak when playing multiplayer games, hehe. \n\nIf the act under question neither exploits bugs/glitches or breaks the game's rules, is it really immoral in a significant sense? What would you consider to be an immoral thing to do in a multiplayer game, besides outright hacking or illegal acts such as hijacking people's accounts or DDOSing their routers? Furthermore, **do you believe that the detached nature of video-games and online gaming facilitates, encourages, or depersonalizes immoral acts committed against other players?** Are there any times committing immoral acts against other players can be justified (e.g. abusing a glitch if another player abused the same glitch first against you)? \n\nI remember at its peak, Modern Warfare 2 had a crazy booster problem. It was very common to join lobbies and then halfway through, discover one of your teammates using a tactical flare (equipment that allows you to respawn where you put it down) and boosting with someone on the enemy team in a secluded place. One person would kill the other person with a headshot or whatever, then they would respawn on the tactical flare and put down another. Then the cycle repeats. \n\nOne day, I noticed that the scores just didn't add up. Me and this other random were absolutely cleaning up the other team but were still losing. I noticed that some random literally had 0 kills and 20 deaths...and coincidentally someone on the enemy team had 20 kills and 0 deaths. I found them on the minimap and noobtubed (grenade launcher rifle attachment) from across the map with Danger Close (perk that increases explosive damage). \n\nBut it doesn't end there. \n\nI then messaged both of the players and told them that they were wasting their time boosting because I was about to start a modded lobby. The game also had a modding problem where players with modded consoles could basically do whateverthefuck they wanted including spawning jets, changing their rank, unlocking everything, etc. \n \nI then told them to invite all of their friends, and that I'd do it for free because I needed a \"full lobby for the mods to work and none of my friends were online.\" Naturally, they fell for it because they were a bunch of dumbass 14 year olds.\n\nI don't quite remember how we did it, but we were able to enter a public match that was just filled with eachother and nobody else. I think its because we marked eachother as preferred players or had the same ports open or something... \n\nSo anyways, I told them all to line up in a line while I waited for my mods to \"configure and initialize.\" I then proceeded to headshot them all and do a bunch of obscure shit to unlock some of the hardest camos, emblems, and callsign backgrounds. \n\nWhen they started to wise up a bit, I invited two of my friends to our party channel and then told the boosters I was going to test the mod on my friends first to make sure it didn't reset their stats or get them banned. 10 minutes later, we joined back the party and my friends started bragging about how awesome my mod was and how they were now 10th prestige with everything unlocked. One of my friends was actually 10th prestige and already had Fall camo on the MG42 (one of the top 5 least used weapons in the game, a very obscure LMG), so he then joined our session to add credibility.  \n\nThe suckers fell for it, so I continued to boost on them. All in all, I did this for **almost two hours** until I unlocked pretty much whatever I wanted, including Fall camo for my favorite guns (camo that required the most headshots to get). \n\nWhen I was finished, I blocked them all and signed out of Xbox Live...but not before sending them a text message with a shortened URL to meatspin.com\n\nI slept like a baby that night :) \n\nI don't think I could say the same thing if I actually used social manipulation to swindle someone out of a significant amount of gold/items in an MMORPG that took forever to acquire.

Everything beyond first playthru especially speed running could be easily codified. \"Twitch Plays ____ Game\" was popular for a while it could well be that bots play these games better.\n\nThere might even be a market for downloading macros from your favourite player if you want to make a build for example - just leave it running for a few hours and come back to a completed process.

As expected, it's been met with a lot of criticism and ridicule.

I decided to go through the classification of the disorder step-by-step while critiquing it.\n\nMy thoughts are as follows:\n\n1. The definition is far too general.  What consitutes problematic gaming isn't clear at all.\n\n2. There really isn't enough research or clinical evidence underlying the disorder's inclusion.\n\n3. It may actually have a damaging effect for the general public.\n\nI've expanded on these thoughts and examined the criteria in this video, if anyone's interested in having a look! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNB1TFizQ1o\n\nBut I'm mostly interested in discussing it with everyone on here because I haven't really seen any constructive conversations about it.\n\n1. Do you think a gaming disorder is a necessary inclusion in a psychological diagnostic manual?\n\n2. Is addiction to gaming specific enough to warrant a disorder separate from the already-existing addiction disorders?\n\n3. What effects, if any, do you think this will have on society or video games in general? Do you think we'll see any changes in games themselves?\n\nEDIT - Loving everyone's replies. Some really interesting points I haven't thought of, it's so thought-provoking reading through your replies",

        "text": "Recently, my wife has been playing through Ori and the Blind Forest, a game reputed to be quite punishing and often unforgiving. I hesitantly recommended it to her after she watched me the play and was enamored by the gorgeous artstyle. SHe is about as casual a gamer as you can get - 90% of her playing time is made up of easy time-killers like The Sims and Rollercoaster Tycoon. She also enjoys platformers like Mario and Donkey Kong, and old school games like Commander Keen and Pepsi Man (anybody remember that one?). So she starts playing Ori and to my surprise, she's actually even better at it than I am! She's just blazing through the game right now and loving it. She's also been playing Donkey Kong Country tropical freeze, another notoriously difficult game, and loving it as well while being really good at it. \n\nSo it really got me thinking, how is someone who has no knowledge/interest of the gaming industry and gaming mechanics be so good at games that even \"hardcore\" gamers may find testing? Is it that \"blank slate\" mindset that helps her be good at it? She is going into these games with essentially no knowledge of their difficulty, reputation or quality, and simply based on artwork (in case of Ori) and childhood nostalgia (tropical freeze). So maybe this lack of expectation helps her tackle the game on its own terms and get immersed in the experience as opposed to \"expecting\" a difficult game and seeing it as simply a challenge to overcome? FWIW she's tried many AAA open-world games which are typically easy and hand-holdy and didn't really enjoy them because \"there's too much talking and too much stuff on the maps\". In fact, she doesn't care for stories and narrative in games at all - she just likes having an objective to complete.\n\nKind of anecdotal but something I found interesting...also I'm jealous that she's better at these games than I am lol :p",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7nss6s/why_mass_warfare_always_devolves_into_a_zerg_rush/",
        "text": "We hear the stories of video games of the dramatic turn-around, where creative tactics and teamwork enable a small group of players to turn back an otherwise overwhelming force and win the day. Yet in an age of so many \"Mass warfare\" video games, why are these stories so rare? For these examples, I'm going to consider any game of at least 40 on 40 to be a 'mass warfare' game. \n\nSo let's look at some factors we can agree about how people behave in video games, and the considerations thereof.\n\n1. Mass warfare games have to account for player turnover. If a round lasts half an hour or more, you can't expect the people at the end to be the same people you started with. Thus mass warfare games are all drop-in and drop-out. Penalizing players for dropping out of such a game will kill sales.\n2. Progression systems have become integral to big online video games. A game where you're fighting \"For the sake of victory\" will lose to one where you're fighting \"to unlock that next accessory on your gun\" or \"To get a fancy hat.\" \n3. A certain percentage of the playerbase HATES to lose. They want to win, they don't care how they win. Joining a game with 10 seconds left and getting a victory screen is the same satisfaction to them as a long hard-fought battle. It's a small percentage of the players, but it's a significant percentage.\n4. Even when there is a stated objective, many players are not playing to that objective. Call of Duty Domination maps are typically 10% people trying to win for their team, and 90% people who want easier kills going for those foolish 10% trying to cap objectives. Shooters like Overwatch are notorious for this in competitive, with people \"getting gold elims' even as their team fails to secure the objective. For a significant portion of the gaming demographic, if someone doesn't feel assured that they're going to win at the game's objective, they make their own objective.\n\nThese lead to a consistent pattern: A game that could be an incredible back and forth battle turns into a zerg rush. Let me use a few of the games from before as examples.\n\n1. World of Warcraft, Alterac Valley: In \"the old days\" when people were fighting for the honor of their side and for the PVP experience, it was normal to have 20-30% of your forces on the defensive. A well-balanced defense could use their closer respawn point to hold off a much larger attacking force. But soon being 'a defender' was meaningless because it was hard, and people didn't want to do the hard job. So instead of 10 people on the defense, you'd be lucky if you had four, which would get overwhelmed by the full 40 players of the other side attacking. Modern Alterac Valley is two sides avoiding eachother at all costs and rushing their relevant bosses, such that there are perhaps 10 kills in the average alterac valley match (in a 40 on 40 match!)\n2. Planetside 2: Bases have a variety of spawn points and as they fall, your defensive forces become more concentrated and able to push back. A well-organized team of 20 could hold the line against an invading force of 50... if you could ever get 20 people to a base under attack. There are marginal rewards for defending a base, but tremendous (10x) rewards for taking a base, and the points go to everyone in the base at the time. So instead of 200 players being divided among five platoons attacking five bases, it's one giant zerg swarm of 200, attacking empty base after empty base (because even a high skilled team of 40 is a speed bump against even 200 noobs). And of course the opposing force is going to form their own zerg rush and retake the bases as the first swarm moves onto the next undefended base. Everyone gets points for capturing a base, nobody had to fight for it.\n3. Foxhole. Ideally this game would be AMAZING for \"small unit with clever tactics takes on a much larger force\" except that the average player avoids a fair fight. They want a win, so when a unit gets pinned down on three sides by the enemy, you'll find half the team evaporates because they'd rather quit and go find a game where they can be on the side pinning down the enemy. \n\nThere is an exception to this of course, EVE online. What separates EVE online from the common 'mass warfare' game is that players have a stake in the outcome beyond a victory or defeat screen, where a battle for territory may impact their revenue for months to come. That gives them the reason to \"stick it out and hope reinforcements arrive\" in a losing battle, it gives them a reason to work together and use clever tactics. But EVE also requires a staggering amount of investment from the player, and penalizes loss, two things that earn it a very \"niche\" reputation.\n\nThere are a few solutions I see, but each has their own drawbacks.\n\n1. Empower players who are in an unbalanced battle. Wintergrasp in World of Warcraft was an open world PVP area where holding it every 4 hours granted your faction access to a particular dungeon with great loot. Thus there was a reason for each faction to want to win this battle and show up every four hours. Except... servers are rarely balanced between the two factions, and in some servers it would be 200 of one faction against 20 of another. The solution was to dramatically buff the under-represented faction. I remember a match where only FIVE enemy players showed up to attack, against perhaps 100 of my faction. We got ANIHILATED because with the entire balancing buff divided across only five players, they were walking gods and one-shotting entire parties. HOWEVER... in a game with drop-in drop-out, you'd have players stick around only for as long as they're getting that buff, then quit when they're no longer getting to be overpowered, and thus the losing side cycles between having 'barely enough' and \"not enough\" firepower.\n2. Greater rewards for fighting a losing battle. As nearly every wargame is now unlocking something in progression, what many players are chasing isn't the 'victory' but rather what they get from a victory. As such they'll quit if they don't think they're going to get that reward. The solution is to give a reward to an outmatched team for defending that is equal to, or perhaps even greater than, that which is assigned to the victors. I'll use Planetside 2 as an example of how this could be implemented. Currently there's only a minor point buff applied to defenders of a base, and attackers all get 2000 points if they're in the zone when a base is captured. What if instead, there are 20,000 defender points and 80,000 attacker points to be rewarded. If you were defending a base when it fell, those 20,000 defender points are divided among you and the other defenders. If you're one of the attackers, those 80,000 attacker points are divided among your group. Thus if you join a 'zerg swarm' of 200 players just stomping bases, you'll receive a mere 400 points, while someone defending a base with ten other players, even if it falls, will get 2,000 points. This \"where's the carrot\" approach would incentivize players to break into smaller groups and each hit their own target, to get a larger portion of the points to be had. Any base under attack will get at least one or two defenders, because two people defending a base will get to split the 20,000 points among themselves even if they lose.\n\nI'd be very eager to hear what ideas other folks have for how we can deal with the conflict between 'mass warfare' game principles, and human nature.

        "text": "Do you know one reason I've always loved platforming games?\n\nIt starts from the first few uncomfortable hops. You jump around, trying to orient yourself, get a feel for the physics. If you're lucky, you get a few safe levels where you can get to the end without real danger. Sooner or later, though, you miss a jump, fall flailing to the ground, or onto spikes, or into a bottomless pit. A few moments later, you're up, trying again. You can try as many times as you want, but ultimately, one thing is clear: if you want to get further, you're going to need to get better. There's no way around it--no level grinding or consumables or difficulty select to push you past a dangerous bit. Often, you have no more to work with by the end of the game than you do at the beginning. [Every time you fall short, you know it's your fault.](https://youtu.be/umnQnrCMp4s?t=649)\n\nA platforming game, done right, will guide you from clunky, careless movement slowly and smoothly towards mastery of a system. Super Meat Boy is one of my favorite examples of this. You start out with [a minimalistic tutorial](https://youtu.be/4_Iq2RPDQ-M?t=117) hopping through a few simple obstacles, and end up flying through [long, buzzsaw-filled labyrinths that require near-perfect execution](https://youtu.be/jgptqlVQGSM?t=141). At their core, Super Meat Boy and platformers like it are games about learning. \n\nThese games demand execution. They coach you until you can rise to their challenges. You could argue that the skills they teach aren't particularly transferable, but that's not terribly important. What's important is that they teach those skills *really, really well*. My aim here is to start a discussion on why they teach so well, and what schools can learn from them. \n\nWhy? Honestly, I feel that the common education model in schools is fundamentally broken, and games like Super Meat Boy are a step in figuring out why.\n\nThe most important point where Super Meat Boy succeeds and schools fail is in the flow of the game: If you don't die on a level, it takes seconds to beat. You move on wasting almost no time, pausing only long enough to watch a [satisfying cascade of every failure](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LongCapitalDuckbillcat-size_restricted.gif) (more on that later). It's only when you're stuck on something, when you need a bit more time, that those seconds stretch on into minutes, or hours, of working out the details until you're ready to progress. This means that even the easy parts are fun. You do well, you're rewarded with quick progress pushing you towards the next point that challenges. Every player is constantly being pushed to achieve more and more. There's never a point where you can sit back and say, \"Okay, I guess I've learned all I'm supposed to.\"\n\nSchools, in contrast, are built on a monolithic model: Every lesson is taught at the pace of the class. If a student masters a topic quickly, they are rewarded with the chance to sit there, bored, watching thirty other students work through the material. If they need more time, the teacher can only hold back for so long before pushing the class ahead. Imagine if, on every level of Super Meat Boy, you were paired with a dozen other players, and the game allowed everyone to progress only when six had won. Half the players would get to sit around watching the end cutscene again and again, the other half would find themselves rushed from level to level before they had a firm grasp, [falling further and further behind](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2012/12/Helping_struggling_students_catch_up.html).\n\nLet's go back to that [end level screen](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LongCapitalDuckbillcat-size_restricted.gif). This is one of the most brilliant examples I know of game design. It removes the sting from every failure, increasing anticipation each time for the final moment of watching a hundred doomed Meat Boys falling into a dozen deathtraps, getting further and further along, with one finally pulling through to the end. What's more, it encourages the player not to quit before completing a level--if you stop and exit the game, you've lost your chance to see it. Failure is expected in Super Meat Boy. It costs a fraction of a second to reset, and nothing more. Each success is built on a pile of mistakes and carries the reminders of growth.\n\nBack to schools. Often, even missed questions on homework are penalized. A failed quiz early on can mean a lost opportunity for an A through an entire semester. A failed test at the end can have disastrous consequences. Each small failure leaves a permanent scar, and [students learn to dread it and avoid it at all costs](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/02/246599742/school-stress-takes-a-toll-on-health-teens-and-parents-say). There's no joyful cascade at the end, reminding a student how far they've come. It's as if someone is standing behind them as they go through levels with a pencil and clipboard, \"hmm\"ing at every missed jump.\n\nOne final, quick lesson: the branching paths and collectibles. Super Meat Boy is full of hidden levels, a hundred bandages acting as optional additions, and a reimagined version of every level adding additional challenges. Sure, you could just rush through the base game and move on, but if any player is hungry for more (or gets stuck in one path and wants to try something else), they have plenty of options, as well as chances to practice old skills in new contexts. In most classes, not only are students progressing at a set pace, they're on a set path. There's no room, or time, to revisit old skills, and little chance to branch out and progress through the course in a different direction. If something on that course isn't working, for whatever reason, the student is told to suck it up and get through it.\n\nNone of this is groundbreaking. Super Meat Boy isn't the only game to teach a skill like this. The tools it uses are well-entrenched within game design. By and large, they're common sense. Common sense or not, though, they've been slow to bleed into other contexts. Games are getting better and better at teaching us how to learn, but a lot of the lessons simply go missing elsewhere. Plenty of people see the potential, especially in education, but most solutions end up trying to toss a couple of surface-level features in [and call it a day](http://bogost.com/writing/blog/gamification_is_bullshit/). The potential is so much greater than that.\n\nThe bottom line is this: If school were a game, nobody would play it. It violates basic principles of game design, expecting students to stay engaged and motivated while dragging them along a set path at a uniform speed and punishing them every time they stumble. Parents and educators worry about kids spending time on games instead of school. There are many reasons, of course, but I think Super Meat Boy teaches a big one: games get the learning process right. They provide a steady, varied stream of challenging activities at the speed of the individual, and give each player as many chances as they need to succeed. And until schools catch up, is it any surprise that students, both the [brightest](http://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10316) and the [typical](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-students-survey/many-u-s-high-school-students-bored-in-class-survey-idUSN2724246420070228), are overwhelmingly negative about school?\n\n**tl;dr**: school should take a lesson from platformers, looking like [this](https://youtu.be/5McCwFBi36I?t=15) and not like [this](https://youtu.be/5SVLIRthpNc?t=5781).",

        "text": "Game of the Year DLC collections ruin the experience. I realize I may be late to this party, but I recently picked up the complete Shadows of Mordor and Dishonored DLC collections which include all content you could get when you pre-order the game from various stores. These are typically just a few bonus items. Maybe one or two of these bonus DLCs wouldn't be so bad, but when you have all of them it spoils any sense of gear-based progression in the early game, or in Shadows of Mordor's case, the whole game.\n\nShadows of Mordor has a rune system which allows you to equip a rune for each weapon that gives you some kind of bonus. These runes drop from enemies, but also there are quests that give you more powerful runes. Completing all these quests give you a very powerful rune for each weapon that includes a capstone ability. \n\nYou know what you get from Shadows of Mordor pre-order DLC? Runes. Powerful runes. And even the capstone ability runes that you get for completing all the quests! The effects are two-fold. First of all, it makes almost every single early rune you get from enemy drops inferior to the ones you start with, ruining any sense of excitement from getting a rune. Second, there's no point in completing those quests because you already have the ultimate reward!\n\nI've only just started Dishonored, but this magic guy said there would be 3 bone shard slots, implying that the choice of which to equip would be meaningful, but instead I have 7 slots and 12 free shards to start with that come from DLC. I can only assume that they will be better than just about everything I find in the early game. \n\nThese pre-order DLCs only make the game worse. I can understand the need to make them powerful enough to encourage a pre-order, but the devs still have to make the game assuming the player won't have them. The obvious solution is to not play with the DLC enabled or skip the overpowered bonus items, but this is not always possible to do and I won't always know what's part of the DLC.\n\n TL;DR: DLC collections have OP items that ruin the sense of progression\n\n",

        "title": "Playing Final Fantasy XII again 12 years after its release has given me a new appreciation of modern game design and is making me rethink the idea of having a backlog",
        "author": "vgambit",

        "text": "Back in high school, I quit Final Fantasy XII after about 25, maybe 35 hours or so. Even then, I couldn't think of why I had suddenly stopped playing, and I never bothered picking the game back up again. \n\nNow, 8 hours into the updated PS4 version, having just reached (I think) the point where I stopped playing before (!), it's almost painfully obvious why I stopped. \n\nFFXII is one of the last old-school AAA titles. It has save points, but no auto-saving or checkpoints. This particular area has you cross a massive desert with no save points for a long time. Because it's an open world, it's easy to think that you should explore and try to find everything, rather than come back later (using, say, the gate/save crystal teleportation system). And when the new enemies you come across seem only slightly more powerful than the one, it's tempting to just let yourself be distracted by optional side areas.\n\nThen strong stuff spawns on top of you, kills you, and sends you back to that save point from 20 minutes ago. \n\nThat's probably what happened. I got caught up in the Sandsea, got killed, and ragequit the game for 12 years.\n\nThe thing that I didn't mention is that the PS4 version has a turbo button that can toggle running the game at normal, 2x, or 4x speed. So that 20-minute penalty would actually look more like 5 minutes, assuming you didn't spend a ton of time customizing stuff (which you generally wouldn't be doing too far from a save point anyway). \n\nPeople complained about the game playing like an MMO, but as a fan of FFXI back then, I loved that I had a single-player way of enjoying similar gameplay with a more engaging storyline. The game's Gambit system allows you to come up with as individualized a playstyle as you want for each individual character on your team, and unlocking slots and targets as you go allows you to sort of ease your way into using it. You're telling the game to play itself, yes, but you can't simply set it once and forget it. You have to keep updating it as enemy tactics change, and it basically allows the designers to make the battle system interesting without bogging down common/frequent enemy encounters with repetitive administration tasks. \n\nBut combining the Gambit system with the turbo button makes this game play like a dream. And the zodiac job system is a massive improvement over the original, which I remember had me giving everyone the ability to cast Cure on themselves, etc. \n\nOverall, this game just has a really nice core loop. Select and equip your party, configure their Gambits, go out adventuring, update your Gambits to suit the enemies you're facing, continue adventuring and gaining LP/loot, then sell the loot to pay for upgrades, and cash out the LP for new abilities before you slot them into your Gambits and head out again. And you have the turbo button for when you don't really need to watch the action and change the flowchart, or when you're running around a lot. \n\nAll of that strikes me because the game is just so much better now than it was in its first release, but that first release was still critically acclaimed, and it also sold well. But today? I'm not sure it would've moved as many copies, given its shortcomings compared just to the updated version, much less its modern contemporaries. It's odd; I'm not sure if it's best to play a game at its release, when it's most culturally relevant, shortly after, when it's been patched a few times, well after, when it can be bought with most/all DLC at a discount, or even past that, when it's been remastered/ported to a newer platform. \n\nThe rub is that, while games are generally better the farther along that path you play them, it's not certain that the game will ever reach the later points, and it can actually be the case that a game gets worse over time, as its shortcomings become less and less tolerable. Because as much as I enjoyed playing this game before I grew tired of it when it was new, I can guarantee that I would not have lasted nearly as long playing the original version today, not when I could be playing its modern competition instead.",

        "text": "#Cost\n\nI know the cost argument remains contested amongst PC and console gamers.  I have no clue how this could possibly be contested.  Mostly because it is entirely dependent upon what type of hardware you purchase.\n\nHowever, as a married adult with a mortgage and a full-time job, I have to budget my expenses carefully. \n\nLet’s take a look at how I much I personally have spent on PC gaming over the last 3 years. \n\nIn October 2014, I purchased a gaming PC for $1200 from iBuypower.\n\nSpecs:\n\nCore i5 4590k\n\nGTX 760 2 GB\n\n8 GB Ram\n\n750W Power Supply\n\nAS Rock Z97 Motherboard.\n\n \nThese parts were carefully picked out by myself and my brother, who is a very experienced gaming PC builder.  He even researched all the parts and discovered that, at the time, the parts would cost $1300, plus shipping from multiple retailers, not including a copy of Windows 7 which iBuypower included for free.  Note: These were not the top-of-the-line parts in October 2014, however, they were upper-mid tier and fit my budget, which was actually $1000, but I was able to squeeze a couple hundred more dollars after cutting some other expenses.\n\nAlso, I was a primarily a WoW player, therefore I had a $15/month subscription attached, along with purchasing two expansions since October 2014. \n\n \n$15/month X 36 months = $540\n\n\nTwo Expansions @ $40 each = 80\n\nMy total cost to game on a PC since October 2014:  Approximately $1920.\n\nIn September 2014, I purchased on Xbox One S for $250, with Battlefield 1, 14 days of free Xbox live, and a month of EA access.\n\nWith the purchase of my Xbox One S at $250, if I spend the approximate amount of money I spent to play ONE PC game since October 2014, I would have an approximate budget of $1600 spend on games and an Xbox Live subscription.\n\nMy current Xbox Live sub cost is $60/year.  So I can budget that for 3 years and that’s $180.  That’s well over $1000 to spend on games.\n\nXbox One S: $250\n\nXbox Live Sub for 3 years: $180\n\nTotal cost: $430\n\nOctober 2014-October 2017 Gaming Cost/Budget: $1920\n\nSo far, I’ve got $1400 to spend on anything I want gaming related. \n\nIf I purchase the games brand new on launch day @ $60 retail, that’s approximately 22-23 games.  An average of 7-8 a year.  That’s a new game approximately every 6 weeks compared to what I paid to game on a PC.  Not too shabby.  Let’s not forget some of the free games included in your Xbox Live subscription.\n\nLet’s take WoW out of the equation.  I still spent $1200 for a gaming PC since October 2014, with the cost of my One S and 3 years of an Xbox Live Sub at a total of $430, that’s still $770 left for gaming expenses.  And we are not taking into account what PC games I probably would have purchased if I was not playing WoW.\n\nAfter I did all of this math, it was clear that I would get a more diverse gaming experience if I kept the same budget over the next 3 years that I did with PC gaming.\n\nHowever, my plan is to NOT spend $1800 over the next 3 years on gaming.  Why?  My wife and I are expecting our first child in March.   Anybody reading this that has kids knows where I will be spending my money…  And for me, the best way to save money, play a more diverse set of games without worrying about compatibility or hardware requirements, is console gaming.\n\nMy current plan is to backtrack and purchase some older titles released on Xbox One just to get my feet wet.  The only games I am planning on purchasing on launch day are EA Sports UFC 3, Madden 19, and possibly a Watch Dogs sequel. \n\nI know what you’re going to say next: “You can spend that money you’re going to spend on the Xbox One S and Xbox Live Sub and buy a new video card!”  Well at the moment, the cheapest GTX 1070 on Newegg is $409.  Also, I have 8 GB of RAM, most top-end games have a minimum of 8 GB of RAM.  By the end of next year, I may not be able to run any games at the minimum required settings.  The fact that I am unable to predict what my PC will be capable of in the very near future means the investment is risky.\n\nFYI: Here is a rundown of other PC games I purchased/spent money on that were not mentioned in this basic budget rundown:  Company of Heroes 2 Steam Bundle: $10, Heroes of the Storm microtransactions: $30, Dawn of War/Dawn of War 2 Bundle: $10, Tabletop Simulator: $20, Overwatch: $40.\n\n#Complexity\n\n The research to build a gaming PC was stressful for me.  I had to research the minimum/recommended specifications for all the games I played, and hoped to play in the future, and attempt to predict how my machine would handle those factors.  Luckily my brother was there to help me.  Furthermore, every time I purchased a gaming PC I was limited by my budget, which limited what I could purchase.  It was really stressful because I was making a serious financial commitment to a machine in the hopes it would not only deliver performance, but last long enough to be a worthy investment.\n\n That issue does not exist on a console.\n\n With console gaming, the system you purchase will play EVERY game that ever comes out for the system.  And the investment has never been higher than $500 (with the exception of the PS3 $599 launch price for the 60 GB mode).  And the graphics will be enhanced as the games progress.  Case in point, games purchased in 2005 for the Xbox 360 pale in comparison graphically to the games released for Xbox 360 in 2013.  Those games were optimized for the Xbox 360 (or any console). \n\n Secondly, when it is time to upgrade consoles, you simply just buy the next generation of console or in this unprecedented case, an Xbox One X. \n\n With a PC, your hardware becomes increasingly obsolete.  This is not an accident. But we will get to that later…\n\n#My personal upgrade Cycle is unknown and determined by many factors\n\n Game developers for PC may choose certain brands of hardware that are optimized best for the system.  Case in point is Tomb Raider.  The game was optimized for AMD graphics cards, while most people purchase Nvidia cards.\n\n You also have to cognizant of what type of motherboard you have, power supply, RAM, processor, and graphics card you have.  There are instances in which certain motherboards are incompatible with certain types of hardware, or do not have enough RAM slots, etc.  \n\n In my case, I purchased a gaming PC in May 2009, and instead of trying to upgrade that hardware, I opted to wait until my machine was completely obsolete and just purchase a brand new gaming PC.  The reason why I had to wait until my PC was obsolete was twofold, I was waiting for the next WoW Expansion, Warlords of Draenor, which had updated character models and system requirements, secondly, I could not afford to purchase new hardware for my 2009 PC and hope I would not need future upgrades.  It was easier for me to wait it out until I could save up enough money to buy a completely new PC. \n\n If you were to ask anybody when you should upgrade and list out your computer’s specs, you may get totally different responses.  And none of them will be accurate, as the system requirements for particular games are not released until the game is ready for release.  It’s a crapshoot.\n\n#Exclusives I care about\n\nThe majority of the games I enjoy are either intended for use on a console or are console exclusive. \n\nTitles like Madden, EA Sports UFC, Need for Speed, NHL, etc, are only released on console.\n\nAlso, I enjoy the Xbox controller.  Yes, you can plug in an Xbox controller into a computer, but that would cost me at least $20 since I only have wireless controllers. \n\nOne of the pillars to any argument for a particular platform or console is the amount or quality of exclusives.  When it comes to exclusives, you personally must do your own research into which games are exclusive to which platform/console and decide whether or not that is valuable to you, as the consumer. \n\nThe exclusives I care about at the moment are only released on console. \n\n#Resale Value/Used Games\n\n You purchase a PC game, it is yours.  Forever.  Your games are only as valuable as you think they are, and they have no value to anyone else.  And if you purchase them through Steam, you’re merely purchasing a license to play the game. \n\nYou purchase a physical copy of a console game, it retains value.  In fact, no matter what the game is, GameStop and now even Amazon will take in the game as a trade-in.  Also, you are able to sell your physical copies of any game to anyone you want, whether it be Ebay, Craigslist, Community Exchange, you name it. \n\nAlso, the used game market is quite enjoyable.  There were many franchises/games I had yet to experience and was able to pick up used copies of these games rather cheaply from my local Gamestop.  Case in point, I purchased Gears of War 3 for $5, Batman Arkham City for $5, and WWE 13 for $7.99 about a year ago for my 360.  I didn’t realize how amazing the Batman Arkham games were, so I picked up a brand new copy of Arkham Knight for only $20.\n\nAlso, if you have a large library of games, Gamestop offers special trade-in deals that can reduce your cost of purchasing new games.\n\nYou are also able to resell your console at any Gamestop.  Of course you can resell your PC, but who in the right mind will purchase a used PC?  I am not an advocate of purchasing a used console, either.  However, I was almost enticed to pick up a used PS3 for $60 at my local Gamestop just to try out a few exclusives.  But I decided to save my money.  But the option was there. \n\n# Game Optimization is standardized\n\n As an avid Raider in WoW, I had to meticulously adjust my graphical settings for raiding.  Even with the gaming PC I purchased, I was unable to get 60 FPS in a raid setting with high graphics.  In fact, Blizzard had to patch the settings menu to allow a Raid Setting and an Environment Setting to allow more streamlined ease of use for gamers.  However, when I sit down to play a game, I just want to play it.  I am in no interest of learning how to get it to perform better on my machine, I just want to play it. \n\nThere’s a peace of mind when I play a console game.  I stick the game in and it will work properly.  The only adjustments I make are for sound, because I have a surround sound system, but if I switch to headphones, I make the adjustment when necessary.\n\nSince I have a 4k HDR TV, certain games optimized for HDR will detect my TV, and ask me for a brightness test.  But that’s about it. \n\nAlso, I don’t really care for Mods or customization features.  Many do, but I do not. \n\n\n#Ease of Use\n\nThere is no PC that is immune to any type of software/hardware malfunction.  In fact, PCs have been known for decades for crashes, viruses, software malfunctions, hardware malfunctions, etc.  The gaming PC I purchased in October 2014 suffered a massive Hard Drive failure, in the middle of a raid, in January 2017.  Luckily, my wife bought me a SSD a few months before, so I able to\n\nI have been console gaming since 1989 starting with the NES.  The only hardware failure I have ever experience was the “Red Rings of Death” in 2007 with my Day One Xbox 360.  Guess what?  Microsoft fixed the console for free due to the 3-year warranty.  My Hard Drive had a one year warranty.  I was SOL. \n\nOn a console, the game is going to run how it runs.  But it will run.\n On a PC, it’s a crapshoot. \n\n Before the 8th generation of consoles required you to install your games, the advantage was exponentially in favor of consoles.  You simply put in your game and played.  Now that all platforms require an installation, that point is moot.  The overall advantage is for consoles.  That is objectively undisputable.\n\n\n#Cheating\n\n PC gaming is notorious for cheating.  Within the first few months of the release of Overwatch, Blizzard announced they had banned 500,000 accounts for cheating by way of aimbot or speedhacks.  They later announced yet another massive ban of nearly 500,000 accounts.  I personally had many experiences with aimbotters and speedhackers in OW.  It ruined the experience for me and after 40 hours, decided I did not want to play in a tainted environment.  This is just one game.  I have yet to see any major cheating scandal involving a console game.  Because consoles are built to specifically prevent any type of hardware or software modification in order to ruin the gaming experience of others.  Cheating scandals in PC gaming are rampant, especially with CS: GO.  I want to play video games on an even playing field.  And there’s no telling how many times I was a victim of someone who easily installed a piece of software in order to ruin my gaming experience.\n\n There was practically an entire industry developed just to combat cheating in games like Counterstrike with the advent of Punkbuster. \n\n To sum up cheating in PC gaming, we all know the infamous saying: “OMFG WALLHAX.”  If cheating in PC gaming weren’t so rampant, this meme would never exist.\n\n#Graphics are just fine for me.\n\nWhile I had to play raid in WoW in 60 FPS due to the stringent requirements of being a raid leader, playing games on console on a 4k HDR TV at 30 FPS feels just fine for me.  As explained above, in order for me to experience enhanced graphics and framerates, my current PC would need at least $400 in upgrades.  The current cost of a PS4 and Xbox One S combined.  Secondly, I know when I purchase a console, as explained above, the graphics on future games will be enhanced, as opposed to declining graphics on newer games.  Case in point, Call of Duty WW2.  My current gaming PC exceeds the minimum requirements for the game, but not the recommended requirements.  Leaving me to wonder what the game would look like on my computer.  Hence I purchased it on Xbox One, where I could do a simple Youtube search to see exactly how the game would look on my machine.\n\nIf graphics were that important to me, I’d have to wager in what games I want to play that support those graphics and how much I would have to spend to upgrade my machine right away and in the future.\n\n#Xbox Live is worth the money, for me.\n\n As we discussed before, I spent double the money just to play one game online (WoW) for 3 years than I would have to spend on Xbox Live. \n\nI know one of the pillars of the Pro-PC gaming argument is that your games are free to play online, unless of course you are an MMO gamer.  Which was the situation that I was in.  I’ve also heard the argument that MMOs are a fraction of the actual PC gamer playerbase.\n\n Bullshit.\n\n During the peak of MMOs in 2011, there were 22.5 million subscribers to paid MMOs.  It was one of the catalysts to the PC gaming surge of the mid-2000s.  Also, some of the top selling games of all time on PC are MMORPGS such as WoW (and all of its expansion packs), SWTOR, Guild Wars 1 &amp; 2, and Star Wars Galaxies.  MMOs have plateaued, and most have become Freemium games (those that are listed as free to play are not “free to play,” they are free to play a portion of the game), but WoW and EVE Online remain paid subscription games.  Thus the argument that “ALL PC GAMES ARE FREE TO PLAY ONLINE” is rubbish.  In order to prove that point, you must add the exception of the MMO.\n\n I have been subscribed to Xbox live since 2003, with breaks in between when I was playing WoW.  One of my biggest pet-peeves when gaming online in PCs was the fact that servers could be unreliable, especially for games like Counterstike and TF2.  I know a lot of PC gamers love the fact that being able to choose a server is a good thing, but one of the issues I would have is the good servers would fill up quickly, leaving me to try and find servers that were not filled to capacity or substandard. \n\n \nYes, you have to pay money for Xbox Live, but I get a good service out of it.  I never have connection issues to the servers and all of the servers are filled to capacity.\n\nSecondly, with the advent of Games with Gold, I have received some amazing video games for free with my subscription.  Some of those great games include Dark Souls, multiple Assassins Creed games, Watch Dogs, Battlefield 3 and Saints Row 3 &amp; 4.  These games are retailed at $50-60 dollars each, but used would have cost me at least $10-30 each.  So in fact your subscription is somewhat subsidized by this feature.  Yes, some games released on Games with Gold are not great, but if you can get 4-5 games for free, it is ultimately paying for your subscription and exposing you to games you may not have thought about playing.  Case in point for me was Dark Souls and Watch Dogs, which led to my purchase of Dark Souls 3 and Watch Dogs 2. \n\n#Potential\n\nI did not opt to purchase the Xbox One X for the clear reason that not all the games would be enhanced for the hardware, yet…\n\nAs this generation of consoles progressed, it was clear that the name of the game was enhancing the hardware on the current generation, as opposed to releasing a brand new console.  As developers become more saavy with the One X hardware, more games will be released with One X enhancements, improving the graphical capabilities at a fraction of the cost.  Like I said above, in order for me to get 4k 60 FPS on the top-end games on my current PC, I would have to purchase a top-end card, which we have shown the graphics cards prices to be horrendous at the moment.  A GTX 1070 will run you at least $400 at the moment, and there is no telling how long that video card will run the next wave of games.  The Xbox One X will surely run every enhanced game at 4k resolution, the framerates are still up in the air.  But as history has shown, console games ALWAYS get better graphical enhancements, with the X in play, I assure you all X-enhanced games will be 4k 60 FPS, and the price of the system will ultimately drop as they always do. \n\nWhen it comes to PC potential, it is all in the hands of the personal consumer.  Want to purchase that mega 1070 or 1080?  Go for it.  How long will that card last?  Who knows?  We have just proven that my GTX 760 will not run max settings on top-end games.  Why would I spend $400-500 on a new graphics card that might run the next wave of games at max settings when I can purchase an X next year, and it will run years of games properly, first time every time.\n\nOn a side note, I think it is good for gaming overall if the Xbox One X is able to consistently support a large catalog of games that run 4k 60 FPS.  Because that would force Sony to come out with a console with similar capabilities, and then there is competition.  Then that would eventually force PC hardware manufacturers like Intel and Nvidia to release hardware at cheaper prices.\n\nWe all know PCWorld tried to build an Xbox One X gaming PC, they failed to beat Microsoft and the cheapest computer they could build was $650. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause when a big company like Microsoft produces a product, they can produce it cheaper.\n\nAnybody with any type of education in economics knows competition in a free market breeds these benefits to consumers:\n\nChoice – You know have more choices for similar products.  Being able to choose between 3 platforms, PS4, XB1X, or PC.  All three can support 4k 60 FPS.\n\nPrices will go down – Sony and Microsoft will have to compete on pricing for similar systems, as they have in the past.  If Sony and Microsoft are successful with their systems, PC hardware manufacturers may have to start producing better hardware at more competitive prices, which will benefit PC gamers.  This is the main reason why every PC gamer should cheer for the Xbox One X’s success. \n\nA new standard is set – If every company builds around the foundation of 4k 60 FPS, then all gamers benefit because they will be playing games that are graphically more superior. \n\n#Steam was a money sink and a trap\n \n\nGoing over my steam profile, I have purchased 30 games on steam since 2007.  These games include:\n\nThe Orange Box\n\nLeft For Dead\n\nLeft for Dead 2\n\nDawn of War 1/2\n\nTabletop Simulator\n\nCivilization 5\n\nHacker Evolution Series\n\nCS GO\n\nCS Source\n\nRed Alert 3\n\n Besides TF2 and Left for Dead, not one game I purchased saw more than 2 hours of game time played.  Not one.\n\n\nSteam is the go-to answer for any PC gamer that wishes to express their loyalty to PC gaming.  I find Steam to be a money sink.  First and foremost, you have to be working to earn money to purchase these games, if  you’re a child with no job, a Trust Fund baby, or putting Steam games on a credit card without paying off the balance every month, you do not apply.  There isn’t enough time in the day, including at least an 8-hour workday and 6-8 hours of sleep, to enjoy the amount of cheap games you are able to purchase. \n\n Mind you, I was a WoW player, and playing WoW took up 98% of my gaming time, but that’s because there were no PC games out there at the time that I felt would be worth my time and money.  Some looked good and I bought them.  But I rarely played them.\n\n Also, Steam is not just a good service for good games, it’s also an extremely good place to put absolutely shitty games.  Luckily in the age of the internet and Steam user reviews, you can take your time and do your research on every purchase.\n\nIf you’re able to spend 40-50 hours a week gaming, you have the funds to purchase these games and that’s what you like to do, more power to you.  But I found that I wasted hundreds of dollars on games through I just never had the inclination or time to enjoy. \n\n#The Hardware releases are a trap\n\nNot that long ago Nvidia released the GTX 1070 and 1080.  They were scores of PC gaming fans drooling at the thought of what this hardware could do.\n\n The problem is, these video cards cost at least $400 right now.  And a 1080 will run you at least $600. \n\n \nA lot of people hate on Microsoft, and to a lesser extent Sony, on the basis of they are gouging players of their money. \n\n If you think Intel or Nvidia give a lovely fuck about you, you’re naïve.  They’re job, like any other business, is to sell you as much hardware and possible.  They are going to continue to release new hardware that is expensive and get you to pay for it.  And PC game developers, instead of trying to maximize the hardware currently in play, will simply take the lazy route and optimize games for more expensive hardware, forcing the PC gamer to consume even more expensive hardware. \n\n I almost got sucked into getting a 1070 when they first came out, however, I realized that paying $400-500 for just one component of my computer was not worth the money for me compared to what I would get out of it.  Maybe it’s worth it for you, but not for me.  I’m not here telling you how to spend your money.\n\n#Local Multiplayer\n\nYes, I know with softXpand, you can do local multiplayer on a PC.  However, local multiplayer has been a staple of console gaming since its inception.  Consoles are built for local multiplayer and are way easier than having to install a piece of software into your computer.\n\nWith consoles, you just hand a controller to your friend or family member and enjoy the multitude of local multiplayer games.\n\n I’ve heard arguments that from PC gamers that claim local multiplayer is “not a thing anymore.”  Well, there has to be evidence in order to support that claim.  And in order to prove such a notion, we would literally have to conduct a scientific study of how people behave in their homes.\n\nWith the advent of the online gaming revolution that started in the late 90s, it became easier to play games with your friends without having to go to their house.\n\n However, any real gamer since the 1980s or 1990s remembers the days of Goldeneye 007 on N64 and how enjoyable it is to play games right next to your friends.\n\n Some may say that there aren’t that many games that support local multiplayer.\n\n Lies.\n\n Here is a short list of games that can be played local multiplayer on console (some may have a PC port):\n\n\nAll Madden Games\n\nAll NHL Games\n\nAll NBA games\n\nAll MLB Games\n\nAll FIFA games\n\nAll Fighting Games (SF, MK, Soulcalibur, Tekken)\n\nRocket League\n\nAll Mario Kart Games\n\nDiablo III\n\nBorderlands: The Handsome Collection\n\nSeveral CoD Games\n\n\nNow all of these games are AAA titles that sell millions of copies each.  So the potential for serious local multiplayer on consoles is there.\n\nConsole does local multiplayer the best.  There is no argument against that.  With the birth of my son on the horizon, I am looking forward to sharing my passion for gaming WITH him, in the same room, without much effort. \n\n \n\n#The Xbox One S was the easiest solution as the centerpiece of my entertainment center.  Getting my PC to be the centerpiece of my entertainment center was more complicated.\n\n \n\nThis past summer, I purchased new furniture for my living room, as well as an entertainment center and my first 4k UHD HDR TV.  Now the TV is a smart TV, however, the processor and software are unreliable. \n\n \n\nThe plan for the entertainment center was to complete my cord-cutting endeavor as well as having support for 4k Blu rays and 4k streaming services.  We also wanted to make sure we had access to all streaming services such as UFC Fight Pass, Sling TV, Netflix, Hulu, and HBO GO.  I also wanted to finally game on a console on a big screen again, as our previous TV was only 47 inches and was not 4k.\n \n\nAfter a quick Amazon search, I discovered that 4k UHD Blu Ray players were anywhere from $120-200. \n\n\nA Fire Stick or compatible streaming media device that offers 4k is around $50.\n\nThat meant I would be spending around $200 just for streaming and 4k UHD Blu Ray\n\nNow I know what you are all going to say, “You can just hook up your PC to your TV.”\n\n \n\nThere are a few pitfalls to that logic.  In order to get what I need out of my PC that my Xbox One S can do, I’d need a 4K UHD Blu Ray drive, which at Newegg.com is anywhere form $120-200 at the moment. \n\n \n\nAlso, my GTX 760 only has one HDMI port.  Which would mean I would either need a converter, or purchase a new graphics card that had two HDMI ports.  NOTE:  I need two HDMI ports to plug my Surround Sound receiver into the device that will be streaming my media, and another HDMI to send to the TV.\n\n \n\nClearly the best bang for my buck was an Xbox One S.  Not only did I get a gaming machine with native 4k resolution and HDR color, I also got a UHD Blu ray player and a streaming media box.  All for $250.  Now, the Xbox One S is selling for $189.  I even convinced a friend to purchase and Xbox One S during Black Friday (For $189) just for the streaming services and 4k Blu Ray player.  He doesn’t even play video games.  But he was delighted to see how much money he would be saving to add this important entertainment device to his 4k TV. \n\n \n\nIf you are in the market for a UHD Blu Ray player and a 4k streaming media box for your new 4K television, the Xbox One S is the way to go.  AND, you can play great games on it.\n\n \n\nNow I know after hearing all of this, if you are a PC gamer, you may be feeling angry.  The one thing I never respected about the PC gaming culture (or the Master Race, as you have wonderfully embraced the most hideous regime in world history), was the vehement defense of your choice.\n\n \n\nHere is why you are all so angry at console and console gamers:\n\n \n\nYou are incessantly trying to avoid buyer’s remorse.\n\n \n\nYou know you are spending a plethora of money on your machines.  As well as high-end mechanical keyboards and precision mice, along with top-end monitors.  And in order to justify that, those that do not do what you do, must be peasants. \n\n \n\nYou might say that this article is intended defend my decision to leave PC gaming, in a manner that can be construed as buyer’s remorse.  That is not the case.  I am not remorseful for my decision to game on PC’s since 2008.  I enjoyed playing WoW and a few other games during this time.  However, as my life changed, my budget changed, as did my needs and wants.  And currently, the console gaming platform suits my needs, wants, budget, and lifestyle. \n\n \n\nI would have buyer’s remorse if I continued with the unnecessary spending, stress, and hassle of continuing with PC gamer.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nA very happy Former PC Gamer and current Console Legend",

You probably understood at that point, it didn't work much, and I'd get frustrated at \"lame 2 APM characters\", especially without \"advanced mechanics\".\n\nI've realized that it is ultimately wrong, and by focusing so much on technicity, the unwise gamer tends to forget about strategy, macro and so on, no matter what the game is. I tried to play slower characters, play clever and strategically, but that wasn't sufficent - I was frustrated by the lack of available options during given situations.\n\nI realized that what I like is freedom of action and hence possibilities ; I can't play a game where a given situation leads to certain death with no escape possibility. I then started to realize that I couldn't play games such as Tekken, for instance : I really dislike combos for that reason, and think they don't make much sense - aside from the purely mechanical standpoint, what does the combo after a given juggle add to the fight, since there's a very low interactivity?\n\nI thought about the fighting game genre, overall ; most of the time, there are gimmicky characters, cheesy strategies and so on - is there any game where the win condition is clear, where a given move always beats another, where the game is very much about playing the opponent instead of playing the mechanical game, playing the game knowledge, playing the little details that immensely matter to the whole?",

I saw that the developers added all these modes to the game that are all fun in their own ways but there's a survival mode that made me realize something.\n\nIn so many survival games I've played the central concept usually revolves around collecting materials and building a home base for yourself, you continue to gather more complex and rare materials to have a better base and better equipment. It just kind of loops in on itself. There's been many great Survival games that I've enjoyed quite a bit, one of the bigger most well known ones being Don't Starve, but something always had me drifting away from the games after a while.\n\nRotTR's Survival Mode is not centered around building a base, its about searching the wilderness for crypts so that you can obtain relics. It works on a score mode too, the more relics you collect in a single run then the higher your score. There's also a challenge system the gives you big stat bonuses, things like kill 5 bears in one run. This not only gives you a reason to be constantly on the move and exploring the game world but it also gives you a reason to want to play again, to see if you can get a higher score to beat your friends. The mode isn't perfect by any means, its more or less designed to be a mini game whereas I see it having potential of being something fully realized.\n\nIt also includes this system where you can buff or weaken yourself before starting so you can increase the percentage of your total score. Its a nice addition, but I can't give credit to the development team for that being an original idea as I think the credit goes to SuperGiant games with Bastion being the progenitor, though I could be wrong about that (just my personal experience). I could praise that incentive system in a whole other discussion, I think its great.\n\nSo, topic for discussion, do you guys think building bases in survival games dissuades the player from being more explorative, since they can't linger too far from home? When you play a survival game what mechanics are the main appeal for you?",

I enjoy it, but I feel like I'm working against the flow of the game.\n\nThis was advertised as a hyper-realistic investigation/cop game set in the 1940's...I remember hearing a lot about \"reading facial expressions to determine if someone is lying\", and of the insane work put into graphics and research into old LA so that the player would feel immersed. \n\nThis is all proven wrong at just about every opportunity. Reading facial expressions is an utter shot in the dark...someone answers a question fairly innocently, but then they squint, purse their lips, roll their eyes, and look nervous. This occurs regardless of them lying or telling the truth.\n\nCole is a very jarring character as well, and he sets the tone for the game...it actually seems like other people act semi-normally maybe 80% of the time, but Cole just never ever does. He goes from calm and understanding, to yelling and swearing he's going to end someone's life, then back to calm. He approaches people very stiffly, almost like he's confrontational, but ultimately just very awkward...he seems robotic.  \n\nThe most frustrating thing is the disjointed dialogue. There was a case where I asked a woman if her husband wore his new glasses, she said he did. I found his OLD pair of glasses at the scene, so I knew she was lying. When I said \"Bad Cop\" to express doubt, I told her I knew she murdered him. Up until that point, the game didn't really indicate that she was involved in any fashion.\n\nSo, if realism isn't the point of the game, what is? I don't think it can be taken seriously as an \"investigation\" game, there are too many odd logic jumps for that. It isn't an environmental or \"historic\" game, because the game doesn't focus on it enough. Definitely not a shooter or a driving game, those mechanics are pretty rough around the edges and clunky. \n\nSo what was the intent? ",

It's a quality of life issue that matters a lot.\n\nSecond: SDH toggle. This is where it says shit like [Toby approaches stealthily] before you even are supposed to know. SDH is the sound effects having described subtitles. It would be nice to turn this off.\n\nThird: With number 1, the subtitle lines being WAY too long and spoiling things ahead. You don't need 30-40 seconds of audio shown at once. It makes it less comfortable to read as well, especially with the small subtitles.\n\nFourth: For the love of everything, *please stop with the \"--\" lines!* The lines that basically spoil you and make you know something sudden and action-y is about to kick off. It's so easy not to do that. My idea would be to spell it all out, then in the dialogue editor, use an effect like red flashing or something that hides the unsaid dialogue really suddenly. This is one that I just don't understand. \n\nSo many people play you gane with subtitles, devs. Also, every single major lets play channel turns on subtitles. It's something that really matters, whether you watch it online OR buy it. I'm really frustrated by the really small 1080p subtitles. I think at least in this aspect, Walking Dead does well.

Because of this, I am mostly drawn to role-playing games or games with role-playing aspects. Many people have a lot of fun with playing something that they are not in real life. Personally, I try to play \"myself\" as much as possible and make choices as if it was all real. But what exactly does that mean for you?\n\nFor the people who are able to say, \"I've always been a tank\" or \"I've always been a healer\", how did you come to this conclusion? It's possible I may just be having an identity/existential crisis but I simply cannot understand the mindset of someone who \"knows\" what their role is in any particular game. For me, it tends to change depending on the context, but that may just be because I don't know myself very well.\n\nSo the question is this: is there a game that specifically focuses on self-exploration of (the gamer's) psyche? Essentially, a game that might as well be one long, drawn-out introspective exercise of sorts? There are a few games that touch on making moral choices, but many of them are too surface in regards to the kind of \"hard life decisions\" and tests of character that I am looking for. I am looking for this kind of experience, but would also like to hear accounts from those who have strongly associated certain games with their overall development as a person.",

        "title": "Essay On Soma and Existential Horror",
        "author": "barkyy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7n3elp/essay_on_soma_and_existential_horror/",
        "text": "Note: This is a spoiler heavy write up. Though I don’t think the game relies on reveals to carry the narrative, there are still some surprising moments that will be spoiled here.\n\nSoma is a game that wrestles with themes we don’t often see in the medium. It is a great horror game, but not in the tradition of normal horror games. What makes Soma a great horror game is not it’s monsters, jump scares, or atmosphere, though these things still abound. Soma deals with the horror of the fragility of self. What are we? Who are we? What is the relationship between the mind and the body? How does consciousness and personal identity work together? The game does this in a way that only games can, through exploration, dialogue, and most importantly, player agency. The narrative is something worth celebrating.\n\nWe start out the game as a man who has already brushed with death. Simon has had a car accident, and sustained some brain damage because of it. He seems to be functioning when we meet him, but he suffers from dizzy spells, and the doctors tell him the damage will continue to progress until there is nothing left. He is somewhat resigned to his fate but keeps good spirits. The day we meet him he is to go to a doctor for a research project. Essentially, we eventually learn, the doctor is engaged in trying to have whole scans of the brain digitized for further study. The hope is that through this technology, they can run simulations of treatment and see the effects on the brain, without the trial and error of drugs and surgeries. Even though Simon is hopeful for a cure, it seems he is mostly interested in helping this research help others. When we finally meet the doctor, and sit down in his brain scan chair, we ask if it will hurt, and then everything changes. Simon awakes in a new place, completely alone, blood on the walls, everything ruined. Simon (nor you) has never been here, nor has he ever seen this place. Thus, the game really begins.\n\nThe game designers here do a good job of letting you know what has happened before Simon does. It’s the way things don’t quite work right with his body, the way he can interact with technology he’s never seen before, and other clues that tell you this is not Simon’s body he is inhabiting. Sure enough, the illusion that he is human is broken, and he is shown to be in a strange suit. Your partner in the game is not surprised that you are here, nor of your predicament, even though Simon is terrified by it at first. The urgency of the current situation has you move along throughout the game without much time for deep thought. Otherwise I think Simon would have despaired right then.\n\nQuickly Simon learns of his predicament. Essentially, the world has ended. The only people that were left when the apocalypse occurred were underneath the ocean in a research lab. The main goal of the game is to launch the ARK, essentially a small number of digitized brain scans put into a matrix-like simulation. To the minds (people?) in the simulation, it would be like real life, but of course they are simply simulations floating through space. The hope is that eventually they will be found by something, and something of mankind will be preserved through the ARK. It’s really the only thing left to do. What else is there to do at the end of the world? The dread is not just existential, but there is really nothing to save in this world, the prospects are about as grim as they could be. The world is over, you are the only ones left. Before Simon “woke up” there was a great drama that unfolded before most of the people were killed. That drama is revealed through memos and emails, and paint a picture as odd as you would expect.\n\nThe antagonist in the game is interesting. He is essentially John Locke made villain. In our ruined facility, there is a project which starts to form, which involves taking a snapshot of the person’s current brain state and putting it into a simulation. The idea, then, is that maybe humanity survives out there in space and can be saved. The problem, of course, is the classic problem of consciousness. Once you make a copy of your consciousness, which is the real you? The antagonist of the story starts thinking about this as well, and determines that the only way to preserve the continuity of consciousness is to kill yourself as soon as the copy is complete. Why he thinks the two different consciousness lines will converge is never explained, but the idea is great. He creates a cult of followers that are obsessed with being saved by suicide, keeping their personal identity intact. If nothing else, the problem with this consciousness copying is a true problem, one that undergraduate philosophy classes have a lot of fun wrestling with. This mode of presentation for the same problem deserves some accolades, since games so rarely go deep enough to give philosophical problems proper weight.\n\nSoma_PC_02\n\nKeeping consciousness alive while the body is barely functioning also plays with our intrinsic beliefs of what it means to be “whole”. As long as my mind is there, it seems like I am also there. Soma toys with this as well. Throughout this ruined facility, there are people hooked up to machines, bodies withered from lack of nutrition but still barely hanging on through machines connected up to them. The raw breaths barely creak out of their aching lungs. If you’re paying attention, the game designers are trying to ask the player if that is all they are. If you lose the body aspect, are you still a human person? The very idea of this half existence is horrifying, and the game designers allow us to linger on these images as long as we want. It creates a wonderfully dreadful atmosphere, one that throws the player into the depths of existential questions rarely asked in games.\n\nYour companion represents the other side of the coin when faced with the consciousness problem. She accepts that our sense of self is this fickle thing. She lives in a small computer that you carry around, so she does not have a sense of embodiment like the main character does, which may sound like more of a horrifying situation than yours. She is completely fine with it, and comforts you when the dread of the situation starts to take you over. She is the grounding force, the other side of the existential argument. At the very end, when both of your consciousnesses are copied and sent off into space, your character has a panic attack. She is the one who tells you “we did it!”, and your character quietly says “But I’m still here”. She replies “But of course you are, you know how this works”. Your character then spends his last conscious moments coming to grips with his situation, that he is left to rot in a dying facility on a dying planet, and the “lucky copy” of himself is sent into space. He did expect continuity of consciousness, but again it failed him.\n\nOne of the more interesting parts of the game is in the middle. The main character literally does a body swap from one skin suit to another. Your companion lets you know that you will be copying your consciousness from one and putting it in another, and that doesn’t bother your character one bit. Once it is done, the game’s perspective changes into the new body. The old body with the old consciousness is sitting unconscious in the other room. You are staring at yourself, your old self. You have a choice whether to leave him as he is (essentially to rot) or to euthanize him. I chose the latter. At that moment, your character says “poor Simon”, as if he is speaking to someone other than himself. He does not realize the tragedy of his situation yet. I realized how horrific it was, but Simon sure did not (yet). The game does a really good job at showing you what’s coming, and still making the delivery of those moments jarring. The dread you start with builds steadily until the end.\n\nThe great thing about the dread this game induces, is that it is nothing other than the dread of our own sense of self. There is a science fiction wrapper around the existential questions here, but the terror arises from asking questions about who we are. I would’ve loved even more of an exploration in something like transporter technology (wouldn’t we just be dying every time we used the transporter?). The fundamental question of who we really are, what we really are, is also given some intense visual imagery of machines melding with man that make us uncomfortable. I speculate this imagery is not made without reason, and probably has something to do with our own image of self and how incompatible our imagined selves meld with the real world. This is probably for someone smarter than me to think about. The imagery is well crafted and harrowing, giving a good gut punch to an already interesting exploration of where we begin and end.\n\nThe only major thing that disappointed me was some of the game mechanics. Like in other Frictional Games, you have no weapons to protect yourself from the horrors you face. The only thing you can do when faced with monsters is to hide. The hiding mechanic makes encounters with monsters incredibly intense and memorable, but I have never found this mechanic great. Often times the creature AI simply doesn’t allow for proper functioning, such as monsters seeing you through walls or hearing you when you made no noise. In Soma the difficulty of these encounters is cranked up to a level that brings the overall game down. There are moments where the developers seem to think you are supposed to feel good about hiding from the monsters, like you are gaining a skill. In my experience, the hiding got in the way of the narrative. I ended up, after some rough first starts, installing a mod that disables monsters from attacking. This made the monster encounters less intense, but increased the overall dread. To see a shambling monster that comes out of the dark, ignores you, and moans back into the dark as they pass, complements the sense of dread the game is trying to induce. I actually recommend everyone find and use this mod when playing the game, as it will make the parts of the game that are great more enjoyable, while suppressing the parts which are not so great.\n\nFrictional Games has done some great work here. I hope more game developers take note of the narrative aspects that could only be pulled of in an interactive game and build on it. We have not had a “Citizen Kane” equivalent of games, but I hope ones like Soma can get us there.",

        "text": "Didn't mean for thatto sound clickbait-y at all, just figured it would be easier to describe in here. Basically, it seems like many in the game community are having a hard time with \"bleak\" or \"blunt\" game endings, which are pretty common in smaller narrative games. I'm really curious to know why that is specifically.\n\nI'm talking about games like Firewatch, Night in the Woods, Inside, Beginner's Guide, and others. I see the pattern of people upset with the ending, and otherwise liking the game. They all have a similar style for the ending. \n\n \nI don't want this to sound *condescending whatsoever*, because it's the last thing I mean. My theory is.. I feel like some aren't used to the concept and angle of bleak endings. Perhaps they're used to games that give you the normal satisfaction of ending a game, which is what they've normally had for decades and decades. Perhaps they don't watch many art house or foreign acclaimed films, etc. The concept just feels \"off\" to them.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I hated things like that as well. I would have been pissed at the end of Inside, so much. But now I appreciate it and get something out of it. The unsatisfactory ending is what *makes it satisfactory* in a weird way. \n\nFirewatch ending info below, watch out!:\n\nI think this game is the perfect example. So many people hated it because they had these expectations, and the narrative swiftly shifted them and left on a sad note. They expected this big mystery and were upset with no payoff. While I can see that, I think the ending says so much more than a usual mystery could have said. The themes of running away from your problems, possibly the main theme of the whole game, is pushed onto you very quickly. And that's beautiful to me. I wouldn't want it to end any other way, because the meaning would drastically change. \n\nWith these narrative games, I see things like Undertale and To The Moon getting damn near universal love, and I think a portion of those people just haven't gotten used to bleak endings. Maybe. I think in time it might change. \n\nI used to hate things like that growing up, before I got used to them. Now it's such an important device for certain stories. I don't know, these are just mainly thoughts about hard to swallow endings, which are becoming more and more popular. I'm not trying to say \"oh shut up, you'll like it when you're more cultured kids\", not at all. But I will say I think a lot of people that hate it will warm up to it over time. I hope so.\n\nUndertale ended perfectly, and it was very satisfying. But to me, things like Firewatch ended perfectly as well. I hope devs continue to make games with endings like those.\n\nWhat do you think about these sort of game endings? To they turn you off? What makes them bad to you? I'd love to understand. Also, if you like them I'd also love to hear some thoughts.",

We believe the core of concise, well-thought out, intelligent gaming discussion should remain and be at the forefront of our subreddit. However it is true that the subreddit itself has fallen behind functionally and aesthetically, which is why we think quality of life updates are necessary.\n\nOur intent is to bring these changes in steps, each week we intend to pin a thread relating to an aspect of change, this week we intend to discuss the CSS with you. We feel that the overall theme isn't a massive issue but could use a bit of an overhaul to breathe a bit of life and personality into it.\n\nWhat kind of theme would you like to see? minimalistic in order to prioritise content? a more inviting colour scheme and layout? let us know.\n\nI will be setting up a Discord channel for live discussion or questions over the course of the week so if you want to talk about it there with myself of Caststarman you are more than welcome.\n\nAt the mention of Discord, I'd like to have a minor discussion this week regarding the subreddit's Discord server. This was a talking point amongst previous moderators, and at a time was decently active. We intend to give this a boost and make it a prominent feature of the sub. Participation is voluntary of course but giving people an arena for discussion with likeminded people can only be beneficial to the subreddit. If you wish to discuss this, please do so on Discord as it will keep this thread for the major point this week and it only seems fitting Discord is discussed on the platform itself (you can find the link in the sidebar.)\n\nWe appreciate your input and look forward to hearing your suggestions!",

Something that was already set by games like Skyrim, AC or even Witcher 3 (though this game in my opinion also was more like a result of current trends than something that was supposed to break ground or introduce anything new). \n\nEven though Nintendo claimed that they weren't inspired by those games, they clearly were. Game has your usual \"Ubisoft towers\" and gameplay/content typical to Open World games (less unique content compared to previous Zeldas but more of the same spread across the whole map - which makes the game very repetitive if you spend a lot of time on it and are a completionist).\n\nNow i don't want this to be a discussion whether this game deserves GOTY or not, i just want to compare it to other games this year and what they did with their design. Even though there wasn't really a game this year that was very original or introduced something completely new, at least they broke some standards that we got used to from AAA or even simply Western games in recent years. I'm talking about games like P5, Automata or even smaller titles like Hollow Knight or Cuphead. Especially P5 while being a big game, it stayed to it's roots, had a closed world design and a different gameplay, even compared to other jRPGs (calendar system and focusing on Social Links/Confidants improving your combat abilities).\n\nAutomata used the narrative of having to finish game multiple times to get the proper ending (something that was also present in older Yoko Taro games), some had their problems with it but overall i think it was fun or at least interesting.\n\nAnd this is the main point of this thread. Those ideas/gameplay were surely more controversial as each of these games' designs had both a lot of enemies and fans, while BotW is almost universally praised with the most harsh \"rational\" criticism being that it \"doesn't do anything new and is your usual Open World game\" followed by at worst a 7/10, which is still a good score.\n\nNow what do you think about this? What approach do you prefer? Something like BotW where game takes what's currently trendy in gaming and improves on it the best way it can or when a game tries to try something different that might not work as well in current climate and even create some controversies?",

        "text": "I've always wondered about this. A lot of people know this game and have played it. I'm thinking about the dialogue engine and writing in particular here. I've noticed that the game's text is extremely easy to digest and read, compared to many other text based games. Maybe it's the short bursts of words, or the humor. Maybe it's the font and animations, or the different use of colors?\n\nIt's sort of like that in Undertale, as well. Both games are remarkably easy to read. Some games are just a chore to really read through what's being said. I think this is a very important aspect of game development, and devs should really spend time focusing on it. Too many indie games have a hard time with this. I think, when done correctly, it makes voice acting not very important. It also lets you add your own thoughts into the game, like a story. \n\nI would also add Final Fantasy VII into this as an example of what bite sized dialogue without voice acting can accomplish. It will be interesting to see how it feels when full voice acting in the remake happens. \n\nIt's interesting to compare these sort of games with other indie text based games like, say, Kentucky Route Zero. That game is extremely interesting and worthwhile, but some describe it as \"slow\", and I think this dialogue and reading pacing is part of it.\n\nAny thoughts on dialogue techniques in indie games these days? Let me know if you have any examples of other small or indie games that are either interestingly easy to read, or tiresome to read.",

Basically, your team can consist of many vehicles such as planes, tanks, turrets, etc., with the player being able to switch into and take direct control of any of their units. Combat would be very similar to World of Tanks or Battalion Wars for the Wii. I want to have split screen multiplayer, where people can share a team and common objective. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I was wondering if any of you have any ideas on whether it would be fun at all to have teammates with which you share all the vehicles? Assuming there is one pool of team money you can buy shared vehicles with, the drawback is you may buy a vehicle that another teammate can take over should you leave it to command a different unit. My alternative would be to have individual pools of money for each player, allowing them to buy vehicles only the purchaser can control; essentially your teammate and you will share a base you must both defend and nothing more. Considering one of my mechanics is the ability to form a squad that follows commands, it seems it could be frustrating for a teammate to hog all the vehicles under a squad of their command. My big question is, have any of you played games with a similar concept, if so, was it fun/did it work for you?",

        "text": "I have been researching very difficult games for a while now and am curious about what is the hardest single-player game ever beaten by a human (not TAS, like [Item Abuse 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuZMvMtZCWU)) - in terms of execution/technical prowess, **not** complex puzzle or strategy games (such as SpaceChem, games made by Matrix, Aurora, etc.). I would like to exclude speedruns from the discussion and limit it to difficulty in beating the game on its own, not making it harder by beating it as fast as possible. \n\nThe top comment to a question similar to this was [I wanna kill the Kamilia 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2aF_HfS3DE), which falls under the genre of fangames for the infamous I Wanna Be The Guy (I wanna be the boshy is another fangame). I asked the fangames community if there are harder fangames that have been beaten by a human, and they pointed me to [I wanna be the ATK2](https://youtu.be/1VJUdT4iIOs?list=PLIIZDmqxnvbYlnyD4t4PxLRzRVzbRiCj5) and [I wanna be the last TIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDubLYv-mhM). So my question is, is there anything harder than these two games that has been beaten by a human? \n\nI gave it some thought and came up with some possible contenders: certain shmups/bullethell games (such as [Mushihime-sama Futari Ultra Mode](https://youtu.be/CrPLhATu9pU)); [Super Mario Treasure World: TsucnenT's Dream Reds](https://youtu.be/sgi0hiCiYi4); [Dustforce – Infini Difficult SS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkOez0mB3cw); [Tricky Mario: The Eternal Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arR_bRuRhjA); [Cloudberry Kingdom Level 319 on PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A07SX6IDcJw) (on PC because you can’t use the slowdown or guide powerups like you can on console. No proof of these clears on PC though); certain N++ levels; top-level feats in rhythm games. \n\nI know some may see this form of difficulty as unfun or unfair (although I would only call it unfair if RNG played a large factor), but I don’t want to debate preferences; I just want to find the hardest game. \n\nSo, has a human beaten anything harder than [ATK2](https://youtu.be/1VJUdT4iIOs?list=PLIIZDmqxnvbYlnyD4t4PxLRzRVzbRiCj5) or [Last TIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDubLYv-mhM)?

        "text": "I've been thinking about this more and more lately because it's something I'd love to play.\n\nI've made suggestions in the past for open world games to integrate something along the lines of the Ringwraiths from LotR. A persistent entity in the game tracking the player down and hunting them. They could go through towns and cause actual destruction, putting actual tangible things on the line.  They would pursue you relentlessly. \n\nFor me Wild Hunt REALLY missed an opportunity here.  The Wild Hunt is a thing in Witcher 3 but you really only witness it through scripted events, and for me it felt underwhelming.  Considering it's part of it's namesake I'm unsure why they didn't make the Wild Hunt a core gameplay mechanic. What I want is a dynamic enemy(s) in the game world out to take you down.  They could do this by force, investigation tracking clues, trapping you.  Multiple different creative ways it could be done.  \n\nBotW could of used something like this as well, Ganon \"super soldiers\" hunting down the newly awakened Link because you are, obviously, a threat to Ganon. It really could of added a sense of urgency to that game, something I felt BotW was lacking.\n\nI'm guessing open world games don't do this because it's extremely difficult on a technical level.  A game mechanic like this would add a whole new dimension to the open world genre though.  Going through towns or areas and being careless could lead to the enemy tracking you that much easier.  Of course, every so often you would have no choice but to confront the enemy, perhaps injuring them temporarily only enough for you to get away.  \n\nI'm also not talking about something that uses \"game tricks\" or a \"pseudo\" persistent thing.  I'm talking about an enemy running it's own routes, triggering it's own events and having a coordinate space in the game world.  No phasing in and out or anything like that.\n\nThere's a need for this in open world games. Towns always feel totally safe.  This is absurd because often the worlds they inhabit are full of danger or on the brink of destruction.  NPC's should be in danger, towns should be in danger, and most importantly you should be in danger no matter where you are.  Can you imagine walking to a town somewhere only to find it devastated by your actions?   Other games that sort of capture this essence of \"being hunted\" are RE3: Nemesis and RE7 but these games use tricks and are not open world.\n\nAre there any open world games that do what I'm talking about?  Is this something you guys would like to see?",

Do they not trust the original developer to turn out a good game? Sony, on the other hand, seem to have a more hands off approach and let their developers do things their own way and the result has turned out some really great, original games. Wouldn't this be a better way to do things or is EA too risk averse to go this route? ",

What surprised me is that there are so much skills sets/mechanics that are creative, fun, and importantly, unique from each. Picking some examples from about a hundred heroes:\n\n* a mage that can quickly short-distance teleports, damaging and slowing enemy near the starting or finishing point of teleportation. His ultimate skill fires a lock-on projectile that hits harder the more HP its target had already lost, and can only be blocked by another enemy hero, thus pressuring low HP enemies to flee the battle earlier.\n\n* a cavalry hero that needs to stay constant moving to build up speed, in order to release his charge attack. Charging also stuns and pushes back enemies, set them up for teammates' follow ups\n \n* a martial artist whose every damage dealing skill send enemy airborne, interrupting enemy's controllability for a split second, and she can chose to use a back-roll after using any skill, evading enemy crowd control/untargeted spells. \n\n* a mage/tank that binds himself and an enemy hero in place, in the duration any attack to these two deals equal damage to both. A tactic is invading enemy tower's range, binds an enemy and let the tower to do the work.\n\netc.\n \nThis is just a MOBA on phones/tablets, and I'm sure prominent MOBA games on PC has even better well-designed, creative skills to use. \n \nI feel that MOBA skills really emphasize crowd control, interruptions, quick lethal combat, and above all, novel, exotic mechanics that due to the need for distinctive heroes; that brings a level of excitement that above traditional RPGs' skills that often boils down to damage dealing of different elements/areas of effect, or stat rising/debuffing. Giving enemies more active skills instead of being just melee creeps/magic projectile casters would also lessen the problem of boring filler battles.",

        "text": "I've been dying to get into VR gaming, as the influx of videos of different gaming experiences around the interwebs shows it to be a lot of fun. I could either go with the PS4 VR or the HTC Vive, but I'm hesitant to buy into the technology quite yet as I'm unaware of what the future holds. Is it worth waiting for new technology? Is there something coming soon that will shape the future of VR gaming? Or is the technology baked and ready to be used? What are your thoughts on the current and future outlooks on VR gaming?",
