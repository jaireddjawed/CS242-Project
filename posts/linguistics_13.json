I was reading Joan Cutting and she implies that the 3 sorts of context are: 1) the situational 2) the cultural and interpersonal background and 3) the co-textual. On the other hand, my professor wrote - and I quote - \"Out of the three kinds of contexts mentioned \\[by Joan Cutting\\] (situational, cultural background, interpersonal) \\[...\\]\" - which made me very confused as to why is my professor making a distinction between interpersonal and cultural background &amp; why didn't she include co-text. Does anyone know why would this happen or is it just my professor who's a little bit odd? I'd ask her personally but we're currently on winter break and she isn't being very responsive to students' e-mails and this is an urgent matter. Maybe it is a stupid question, but as I mentioned priviously - I'm not very good at understanding linguistics. Thanks in advance :)",

Edgerton expands Sievers's law to all resonants and claims sandhi forms should be unfused.\n\nIn his book \"Edgerton's Law: The Phantom Evidence\" Andrew Sihler references \"Vedic metre in its Historical Development\" by Arnold and uses to judge what constitutes as irregular metre (uncommon end cadence or break) and goes over Edgerton's examples where he rescans verses of rigveda. Excerpt from the book:\n\nRV 5.6.4b dyumántaṁ devājáram\n\nThis verse is lacking a syllable but is not catalectic. Resolving deva ajáram fills out the syllable count,  ᴗ – – – | ᴗ ᴗ ᴗ – ; nevertheless the cadence is irregular (\"rare\"), Arnold §184). Like vowels often contract in the Rigveda, but hiatus after a vocative is also unremarkable. Scanning diyu instead , scans  ᴗ ᴗ – – | – – ᴗ –. The irregular cadence of this reading rare, too rare indeed being found only half as often as | ᴗ ᴗ ᴗ – (Arnold §190.i). This pāda therefore does not count as evidence for Edgerton's theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe concludes that Edgerton's claims are unfounded and cites Collinge \"It is hard to believe that Edgerton's theories could ever have gained the status of even a \"temporary ... pseudo orthodoxy\"\n\nSihler as well as Arnold whom he's referencing have their own works where verses are scanned differently than received, but mentions that the whole paradigm might be unfounded.\n\nThis isn't the only instance the text has been tampered with. When western scholars got hold of the rigveda it was received edited (tampered with) by Eugène Burnouf making deciphering it that much more difficult.",

Every language represented in the map has at least one instance, though some may have two or three (or even more due to multilingual sign overlap).\n\nHere is the map: [https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/63a9337b365e8369e84f3309](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/63a9337b365e8369e84f3309)\n\nAnd the challenge link: [https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/efZM6BEdAoJyKtoy](https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/efZM6BEdAoJyKtoy)\n\nFor the list of included languages at the time of this post, see the gallery in Post 2: \\[link\\]\n\nAlthough I definitely gave a thorough sweep of the world's major language families, I am well aware that there are more languages out there to explore.

After hours of researching obscure languages and tracking and choosing relevant road signs, I have amassed over 130 locations, each one containing an example of a spoken language. Every language represented in the map has at least one instance, though some may have two or three (or even more due to multilingual sign overlap). \n\nHere is the map: [https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/63a9337b365e8369e84f3309](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/63a9337b365e8369e84f3309)\n\nAnd the challenge link: [https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/efZM6BEdAoJyKtoy](https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/efZM6BEdAoJyKtoy)\n\nFor the list of included languages at the time of this post, see the gallery in Post 2: \\[link\\]\n\nAlthough I definitely gave a thorough sweep of the world's major language families, I am well aware that there are more languages out there to explore.

        "text": "I'm currently working on a conlang(which I won't self-promote in this post) that is a fictional descendant of the (classified as possible on the Wikipedia list for language family proposals at this current moment) common ancestor of the Kra-Dai languages and the Austronesian ones, similar to Vostiak being related to the (classified as controversial on the same article) common ancestor of Proto-Uralic and Proto-Eskimo-Aleut. That family hypothesis is the Uralo-Siberian theory that Michael Fortescue hypothesized in 1998 with his book \"Language Relations Across the Bering Strait\". I haven't actually read the book or looked into it, though I think that Fortescue might've used the accepted fact that humans migrated from parts of Siberia to North America while the ice bridge Beringia was still there as a factor to justify his theory.\n\nAnyway, Proto-Austro-Tai was proposed by Weena Ostapirat in 2005, [who would later expand upon it eight years later](http://jseals.org/seals23/ostapirat2013austro-taih.pdf). In recent years, [Alexander Smith would build upon the idea with his own comparisons](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YNjfYXj71guuPCq2S4PJpLOslnms79GD/view). Looking at the cognates and correspondences, I might take a wild guess at what I think might be the sounds. Though now that I think about it, the well-known reconstructed phonologies for Proto-Kra-Dai show some contradictions. Let me show my guesses first.\n\nConsonants: \\*\\[p\\], \\*\\[t\\], \\*\\[k\\], \\*\\[m\\], \\*\\[n\\], \\*\\[ŋ\\], \\*\\[s\\], \\*\\[w\\], \\*\\[j\\], \\*\\[q\\](which might’ve merged with \\[k\\] in Proto-Kra-Dai), \\*\\[ʎ\\](I'll come back to these consonants.)\n\nVowels: \\*i, \\*u, \\*a\n\nI am aware of the flaws and lack of naturalism, and I'm more new to linguistics than I am at conlanging. Another issue to note is a lot of holes I'm noticing based on my recoveries of the reconstructions of Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Kra-Dai.\n\nI'll start with Proto-Austronesian. Here is the reconstruction courtesy of Robert Blust (2009).\n\nConsonants: \\*\\[p\\], \\*\\[b\\], \\*\\[t\\], \\*\\[d\\], \\*\\[ɖ\\], \\*\\[k\\], \\*\\[g\\], \\*\\[gʲ\\], \\*\\[q\\], \\*\\[m\\], \\*\\[n\\], \\*\\[ɲ\\], \\*\\[ŋ\\], \\*\\[t͡s\\], \\*\\[t͡ʃ\\], \\*\\[d͡ʒ\\], \\*\\[s\\], \\*\\[ʃ\\], \\*\\[h\\], \\*\\[ɾ\\]/\\[r\\]/\\[ʀ\\], \\*\\[l\\], \\*\\[ʎ\\], \\*\\[j\\], \\*\\[w\\]\n\nVowels: \\*\\[i\\], \\*\\[u\\], \\*\\[ə\\], \\*\\[a\\], \\*\\[ai\\], \\*\\[au\\], \\*\\[ui\\], \\*\\[iu\\]\n\nAnd the one by John Wolff (2010).\n\nConsonants: \\*\\[p\\], \\*\\[b\\], \\*\\[t\\], \\*\\[d\\], \\*\\[c\\], \\*\\[ɟ\\], \\*\\[k\\], \\*\\[g\\], \\*\\[q\\], \\*\\[m\\], \\*\\[n\\], \\*\\[ŋ\\], \\*\\[s\\], \\*\\[ʁ\\], \\*\\[h\\], \\*\\[l\\], \\*\\[ʎ\\], \\*\\[j\\], \\*\\[w\\]\n\nVowels: \\*\\[i\\], \\*\\[u\\], \\*\\[ə\\], \\*\\[a\\], \\*\\[ai\\], \\*\\[au\\], \\*\\[ui\\], \\*\\[iu\\]\n\nNow for the Proto-Kra-Dai ones. The phonology courtesy of Ostapirat (2018).\n\nConsonants: \\*\\[p\\], \\*\\[b\\], \\*\\[t\\], \\*\\[d\\], \\*\\[c\\], \\*\\[k\\], \\*\\[q\\], \\*\\[m\\], \\*\\[n\\], \\*\\[ŋ\\], \\*\\[r\\], \\*\\[s\\], \\*\\[j\\], \\*\\[l\\], \\*\\[w\\], \\*\\[t͡s\\]\n\nI might consider adding \\*\\[g\\], just in case, though Thai doesn't have it.\n\nVowels: \\*\\[i\\], \\*\\[u\\], \\*\\[ɤ\\], \\*\\[ə\\], \\*\\[a\\], \\*\\[iː\\], \\*\\[uː\\], \\*\\[ɤː\\], \\*\\[aː\\]\n\nThis one is thanks to [Peter Norquest (2020)](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/73804/1.0389866/6). (Some guesses by me based on some proper logic to go off of.)\n\nConsonants: \\*\\[p\\], \\*\\[b\\], \\*\\[t\\], \\*\\[d\\], \\*\\[ɖ\\], \\*\\[ɟ\\], \\*\\[k\\], \\*\\[g\\], \\*\\[ʔ\\], \\*\\[m\\], \\*\\[n\\], \\*\\[ɲ\\], \\*\\[ŋ\\], \\*\\[r\\], \\*\\[s\\], \\*\\[h\\], \\*\\[j\\], \\*\\[w\\], \\*\\[t͡s\\], \\*\\[ˀb\\], \\*\\[ˀd\\], \\*\\[ˀɖ\\], \\*\\[ˀɟ\\], \\*\\[pʰ\\], \\*\\[tʰ\\], \\*\\[kʰ\\], \\*\\[ʰm\\], \\*\\[ʰn\\], \\*\\[ʰɲ\\], \\*\\[ʰŋ\\], \\*\\[ʰr\\], \\*\\[ʰj\\], \\*\\[ʰw\\], \\*\\[ˀm\\], \\*\\[ˀn\\], \\*\\[ˀɲ\\], \\*\\[ˀŋ\\], \\*\\[ˀr\\], \\*\\[ˀj\\], \\*\\[ˀw\\], \\*\\[mˠ\\], \\*\\[nˠ\\], \\*\\[tʲ\\], \\*\\[m̥\\], \\*\\[n̥\\], \\*\\[ɲ̊\\], \\*\\[ŋ̊\\], \\*\\[r̥\\], \\*\\[j̊\\], \\*\\[w̥\\]\n\nVowels: \\*\\[i\\], \\*\\[ɪ\\], \\*\\[ɨ\\], \\*\\[ʉ/ɯ\\], \\*\\[u\\], \\*\\[ə\\], \\*\\[o\\], \\*\\[ɤ/ɔ\\], \\*\\[a\\], \\*\\[æ/ɑ/ɐ\\], \\*\\[iː\\], \\*\\[ɪː\\], \\*\\[ɨː\\], \\*\\[ʉː/ɯː\\], \\*\\[uː\\], \\*\\[oː\\], \\*\\[ɤː/ɔː\\], \\*\\[aː\\], \\*\\[æː/ɑː/ɐː\\]\n\nKnowing that one set of Proto-Austro-Tai and one of Proto-Kra-Dai were both reconstructed by Ostapirat, it could stand to reason for my guess of \\*\\[q\\] being part of PAT. My guess for that palatal lateral comes from looking at the \"final consonant\" correspondences proposed by him. The idea of it being part of PAT could lead to the idea of it \"de-palatalizing\" to \\*\\[l\\] in Austronesian and \"de-lateralizing\" to \\*\\[j\\] in Kra-Dai. Of course, I'm likely getting things wrong here. Again, I need to look into the basics. Yet, I wonder what you guys think the proper proto-langs most likely sounded like based on the information I just listed and linked, and the cognates these linguists chose. Though I need to read about parts in regards to them accounting for borrowings that might've been a thing, in case it's the Altaic controversy all over again.",

There is one more sound \"Ch ch ch ch\" these are light repeated sounds that are made when you suddenly find out about a bad thing happened to either yourself and someone else. this is akin to talking more to yourself though that you feel bad about what happened. It is more likely to be heard by the person who received the loss and often the loss is like loosing your wallet. It is sometimes used for big tragedies but this usage is more rare.  \n\n\nMy main question is these types of thing must be more common and many different variants might exist. Have there been thorough attempts at enumerating/recording such things. If so where and how can I find them.",

        "text": "Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

The type I liked and referred to as a zeugma was type 2 (\"my nose and feet were running\", \"he took his hat and his leave\"), and type 3 is another I am a fan of but didn't know was an example of zeugma. Type 1 to me seems like a combination of type 2 and 3, and was another type that I like and have used but didn't know it was a zeugma. But it's type 4 I am struggling to understand. \n\nWikipedia says about type 4 -\n\n&gt;A special case of semantic syllepsis occurs when a word or phrase is used both in its figurative and literal sense at the same time. Then, it is not necessary for the governing phrase to relate to two other parts of the sentence. One example, from the song \"What's My Name?\", is: \"Okay, there we go / Only thing we have on is the radio.\" Another example is in an advertisement for a transport company: \"We go a long way for you.\" This type of syllepsis operates in a similar manner to a homonymic pun. \n\nBut I don't understand the example. What from the song is the zeugma? Or the moving company? Is it just me not understanding the words themselves enough to see a homonymic pun? I'm confused but I don't know how confused I actually am, as in, am I unable to understand because I'm reading too much into these examples? \n\nI did end up looking into homonymic puns too to make sure I knew what those were, and I do, the Wikipedia article on puns is more extensive than I thought it'd be too. I definitely learned new types of puns from it, but that's off topic. \n\nClarification is appreciated.",

At most, it's been a source of constant gags and references across the internet, mainly on Youtube. One infamous scene, possibly the most memorable scene in the game, is [this bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv7jvyslRek), where Mario observes the situation and caps it off with \"You know what they say: All toasters toast toast!\"\n\nNow, the reason this is remembered is without a doubt because the phrase sounds like complete nonsense. It's a joke with no punchline, it comes completely out of nowhere, and, literally speaking, it's not even true. Toasters toast bread, not toast.\n\nWith that said, I'm *extremely* curious to know if this has an origin or if it's just something a half-asleep game developer scribbled down. Was there a phrase like this at any point in history? I could see it emerging maybe in the 60s when electrical appliances were taking off. And divorced from the context of a plumber searching for a princess in a house with poor wiring, it could be a sort of common sense phrase, as if to say \"This thing here is only designed for it's intended purpose and nothing else.\" I feel like I've heard a phrase that makes a similar point, but I can't think of an example right now.\n\nAnyway, if this was a common phrase anywhere at any point it's definitely become obscure by now. So if no one here knows the answer, is there a resource I could use to find uncommon or out-of-fashion phrases like this?",

My question is Arabic always seems to get grouped in with Hebrew and Aramaic and Canaanite languages as a \"Central Semitic\" language while the ancient Old South Arabian languages and Ge'ez are called \"South Semitic\". Why makes Arabic Central Semitic and not South Semitic? I am able to read Hebrew letters and while I do see a few similarities between Hebrew/Aramaic and understand some words here and there, it's mostly unintelligible. On the other hand, EVERY South Semitic text I've encountered is at least halfway to mostly understandable, especially Himyaritic and Sabaic which just sound like odd ancient Arabic dialect (am- instead of al-, pronounced final ة ). Even Ge'ez is far more understandable than Hebrew, to the point I would have expected Ge'ez and Arabic to be considered cousin languages rather than Arabic and Aramaic or Hebrew, which seem more like distant cousins, while the Old South Arabian \"languages\" just sound like dialects to me. So what's up with this categorization? Are the similarities between Arabic and South Semitic just vocabulary (I have a hard time detecting any grammatical differences) or is this the result of something lost in translation among scholars who are non-native speakers? I recall a presentation by Dr Ahmad Al Jallad saying that all the various Ancient North Arabian \"languages\" were really just Arabic dialects that are being miscategorized by Western scholars, could the same thing be going on with the South Semitic languages? Or is there just a lack of study on other Arabian languages besides Arabic causing Arabic to be arbitrarily thrown with the other well-studied Semitic languages?",

Why makes Arabic Central Semitic and not South Semitic? I am able to read Hebrew letters and while I do see a few similarities between Hebrew/Aramaic and understand some words here and there, it's mostly unintelligible. On the other hand, EVERY South Semitic text I've encountered is at least halfway to mostly understandable, especially Himyaritic and Sabaic which just sound like odd ancient Arabic dialect (am- instead of al-, pronounced final ة ). Even Ge'ez is far more understandable than Hebrew, to the point I would have expected Ge'ez and Arabic to be considered cousin languages rather than Arabic and Aramaic or Hebrew, which seem more like distant cousins, while the Old South Arabian \"languages\" just sound like dialects to me. So what's up with this categorization? Are the similarities between Arabic and South Semitic just vocabulary (I have a hard time detecting any grammatical differences) or is this the result of something lost in translation among scholars who are non-native speakers? I recall a presentation by Dr Ahmad Al Jallad saying that all the various Ancient North Arabian \"languages\" were really just Arabic dialects that are being miscategorized by Western scholars, could the same thing be going on with the South Semitic languages? Or is there just a lack of study on other Arabian languages besides Arabic causing Arabic to be arbitrarily thrown with the other well-studied Semitic languages?",

        "text": "Spanish isn't my native language, but I think I'm decent at it. You pronounce all the syllables at roughly the same length, and you don't reduce unstressed vowels like in English. I'm comparing it to Japanese, wherein the same thing applies, but syllables are stressed using \"pitch-accent\". \n\nIn Spanish, I can clearly hear the difference between \"paso\" and \"pasó\", or \"el respeto\" and \"él respetó\". To my untrained, amateur ear, it sounds like the stressed syllable is slightly longer and slightly louder than the unstressed syllables, and said at a slightly higher pitch. However, if I deliberately pronounce them with exactly the same length and volume, I can tell which is the stressed syllable just from the pitch I pronounce them with.\n\nHow is this different from pitch accent? Isn't stress in Spanish, a language without pitch-accent, also indicated with stress? Is it just that in Japanese, stressed syllables are never spoken more loudly than unstressed ones, unlike in Spanish?\n\nI don't know if this is related, but Spanish is a syllable-timed language, whereas Japanese is mora-timed. I admit that I'm not sure what the difference is there, either. To me, it just seems like timing in Japanese is similar to Spanish; it's just that Japanese has a simpler syllabic structure. Is this related to stress in any way?",

The correct question might be: why did the  Thyrrenian languages (Etruscan and Raethian) survive the installation of indoeuropeans? And why did some indoeuropeans picked up these ancent langauges? \n\nI know that the discourse on the various languages of late bronze age and iron age Italy is much more complex and there were other populaition that used to speak non-european languages, but as far as I know they were not of indoeuropean descent (people such as Sardinians and Ligurians). \n\nI'm not a complete illitterate on the subject but I'm not a huge expert eather. My knowledge is limited to a couple exams on Iron Age Italy I did in Uni and to some very lazy personal research I did on the internet. I really whish with this conversation to get some interesting insights that can help me better understand the subject, also by taking in consideration more recent studys. \n\nPlease feel free to correct me if I have stated any wrong information above.\n\n Have a nice day/night!",
