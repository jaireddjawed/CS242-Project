What you need to understand is that the technology isn’t serving the same purpose as the internet itself. It’s centered around providing a better storage system for data, a more transparent payment system with a public ledger, and a more effective transaction system. Yes, we hear a lot about WEB3 and all these buzzwords, but you need to separate marketing teams from developers. There are a lot of challenges facing decentralization and it’s developing, albeit, slowly. It’s important to understand the value behind the technology, and that is why it’s attracting interest from all over the world, whether that is governments or the average joe, the technology has proven its utility. Question is, how do you feel this technology would evolve to be in the future?",

The idea being that as systems become more complex and interconnected, there is just TOO MUCH going on for anyone to try and make sense of it. \n\nFor example, if there was a large scale grid failure that caused the failure of lots of other infrastructure, there’s no telling how long it would take humans to figure out a plan to fix it.

        "text": "In the realm of quantum science, there is an ongoing debate about the possibility of God's existence. While some may argue that science is not the appropriate forum for discussing such topics, there is evidence that suggests that quantum science may be able to provide proof for God's existence.\n\nTo begin, quantum science is based on the concept of quantum entanglement, which is the process by which two particles become linked together and can influence one another, regardless of the distance between them. This concept has been used to explain phenomena such as the spin of particles and the behavior of light.\n\nThis same concept of quantum entanglement can also be used to explain the concept of divine intervention. It has been theorized that particles in the quantum world are connected to a higher power, or God, in some way. This connection would allow God to influence the behavior of particles on the quantum level, which could explain the mysterious phenomenon of divine intervention.\n\nFurthermore, quantum science also suggests that the universe is fundamentally connected and that everything is part of a larger whole. This idea of interconnectedness is similar to the concept of God being the ultimate source of all things.\n\nFinally, quantum science is based on the idea that the universe is based on non-deterministic principles. This concept of unpredictability is similar to the idea of divine will, as it suggests that God has the power to intervene in situations and to cause events to occur that may have otherwise been unpredictable.\n\nIn conclusion, quantum science suggests that there may be evidence for God's existence. While it is impossible to definitively prove or disprove the existence of God, quantum science does provide some evidence that may suggest the presence of a higher power.",

        "text": "I personally love AI but the emergence of AI  has raised a lot concerns over the past year and rightfully so. Many artists feel violated by the fact people can take the likeness of their art style and replicate it in whatever way they want. These are unique styles some of them spent their entire lives perfecting and for it to be able to replicated in an instant can make them feel useless. Worst part is when people can make money off of these artist's styles while the artists don't make a cent. So their discontent is understandable. \n\nNow, I'm also very understanding of the fact that technically, what the AIs are doing is legal. Humans can be inspired by any work of art and create something in that same style. In that same light, AIs take in data and create something new from it. So how do make things fair for these artists moving forward? As AI evolves, it may further continue to make artists feel useless and in turn, discourage artists from creating new things which are what drive innovation/creativity forward. AIs outputs and only as good as the human inputs and when people stop creating new things, creativity may become stale. \n\nI think blockchain technology can potentially help to address some of the issues around the use of AI in creating and distributing art. By using a decentralized database, a blockchain can create a permanent and unalterable record of ownership and usage rights for artists. A system can be set up where artists can upload their work and get their digital signature on all of it. So, when people use their art in creating anything, credit is given and if the art is sold, smart contracts can automatically distribute compensation to artists. This should also count for whenever the AI  uses an artists likeness without a human prompting for it. \n\nNow, I'm aware that implementing such a system would require significant effort from both the technology and the art communities, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure its proper functioning and enforcement. It would require all these AI companies to concede to such a massive undertaking... after already downloading all of this data. So it seems as an unlikely endeavor but it's all I have for now. \n\nWhat do you think can be done about this? I think the potential for AI to change the way capitalism currently functions is... rather high. Maybe in the future, contributions to the AI algorithms with new art, new writings, new things will be what's compensated while we all still get UBI? I don't know, lots of questions lol. Now I'd love to hear what you guys think.",
