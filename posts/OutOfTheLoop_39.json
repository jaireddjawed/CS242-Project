She gets clowned on a lot from what I've seen. I tried to find details about why people make fun of her a lot, and all I found was \"she's an industry plant\" or \"her dad is Benzino\", but I don't know how that would make her so clowned on exactly. Some people make it seem like she ran over their dog or something.",
