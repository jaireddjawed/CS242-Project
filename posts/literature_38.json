Aside from their specious arguments about some of the traditional classic works themselves, I wanted to get your thoughts on whether classics are valuable and whether they should be replaced with different books instead. Is that even a valid question?\n\nPersonally, I feel that it doesn't have to be either/or, but rather we should read the classics and the alternatives to experience a richer view of literature and the human experience--even if it's uncomfortable sometimes. I don't necessarily think that we need to throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak. \n\nThe criticism that they point towards some of the classics is sometimes just flat out wrong. For example, this quote about Catch 22, \"It fails to capture the absurdities and impossible conflicts of war,\" is hyperbolic at best. I have my own issues with Catch 22, but arguing that it doesn't capture the absurdities of war is just objectively incorrect.\n\nSo what do you think? Is this just clickbait to get the snooty literature folks upset? Do they have valid points about replacing certain classics with other novels? Is that even a productive exercise?",

        "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nBecause I just finished David Foster Wallace's collection of essays *Consider the Lobster*, and because the number of articles posted without any user commentary is too damn high, I wanted to start a discussion. \n\nTo me, the most intriguing thing about DFW's writing is his focus on contemporary American issues that many of the older great writers didn't/couldn't write about. Wallace's insights into the nature of marketing, it's corrosive effect on political morale, entertainment, and alienation, all feel fresh and genuine. Moreover, he is young enough to have been immersed in rampant marketing his entire life. It was a reality to him, as well as many of us, as opposed to the oddity is would have been for an older generation. There's an immediacy to Wallace's writing and themes which just doesn't exist in a *Blood Meridian* or *The Sound and the Fury*. Whether or not his writings will transcend his generation like *Gatsby* did, or will it prove to be too provincial, will be determined by time. \n\nMy personal favorite of the essays was *Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky*. In it, Wallace critiques contemporary American art's inability to confront ideology, moral conviction, with any depth. Wallace posits that art has been predominantly used as a destroyer or critic of ideology, rather than bolstering any coherent worldview. Thus, a Dostoevsky could not emerge in modern American culture, even if an individual had his talent and convictions. Irony and aloofness seem to be a predominant feature of art. \n\nI agree to a large extent with what Wallace is saying, but I can't help but feel that the cultural homogeneity of intelligentsia St. Petersburg allowed a writer to truly become a \"national voice\". Dostoevesky needed to speak to or confront one intellectual horizon only. Can a national voice truly exist in multicultural America? Are we too fragmented in our values to universally love a writer?  \n\nMy least favorite essay was  *Big Red Son*- an expose of the Adult Video Network awards and the porn industry at large. In the hands of a writer and observer like DFW, I would have thought that this topic would be a veritable goldmine. Unfortunately, the essay falls flat and never seems to launch off of its base subject matter into more interesting considerations. I would hope he would have considered something like the warped sexual aesthetic sensibilities that porn engenders. Or perhaps he could have considered the escalation necessary when sexual imagery is so pervasive as to become mundane. More and more exotic forms of sexuality are needed to elicit the same response. However, the essay never ventures into such interesting topics, and instead we get a fifty-plus page essay on how devoid of restraint or tact porn stars and producers are. Who would have thought?\n\nThis leads me to my greatest criticism of DFW. In hindsight, I'm not sure how novel or deep his observations truly are. He does a great job giving context to his insights which make them feel weighty. But how deep, for example, is the insight \"Elite athletes have an emptiness of mind which allows themselves to be wholly ingrained in the physical act of doing\" (this comes from *How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart*).\n\nAll in all, I thought it was a really solid, but uneven collection of essays. At his best, I think DFW was a generational talent. \n",

        "text": "Perspective in “Arcadia”: Through the Eyes of the Beholder\n\nMan has always ruminated on the nature of existence, be it through the cave paintings of the first humans or the contemporary literature of today’s world. As Man learned, however, we quickly discovered that the nature of reality was far removed from our own. The idea of fear at the dichotomy between objective reality and human understanding is present in many works, some even posing solutions to the problem of coping with a harsh universe. “Arcadia” by Tom Stoppard focuses itself with the idea of individual perspective as a bulwark against the daunting knowledge of the universe’s scale, chaotic nature, and eventual finality. \n\nThe structure and non-omniscient third-person perspective present in the narrative of “Arcadia” allows for the audience to experience the play on the same level as its characters. Many key pieces of information are kept hidden from the reader throughout the play in the form of lost and/or limited knowledge. This presents an understanding of events through the lens of the characters involved, often limiting the audience’s knowledge strictly to what they have seen. This is atypical of many third person narratives that contain multiple coinciding storylines, which usually allow for the reader to maintain a greater understanding of events than the subjects of the work itself. Others have argued that the play’s temporal shifts do allow for a dichotomy between the viewpoints of the characters and the audience. One such critic, Derek B. Alwes, argues “…the larger focus conferred on us by the temporal shifts in the play enable us to recognize we can recover much of what has been lost” (398). Though the use of alternating time periods does provide the reader with a viewpoint of multiple situations, which the characters do not have, this knowledge is subverted by the complete loss or temporary inaccessibility of certain vital pieces of information in each situation; this breaks the semblance of the audience’s viewpoint being all knowing. The strongest example of this limitation is the letter from Byron that Septimus burns without ever opening. This focus on the frailty of knowledge throughout time reinforces the idea that the audience is meant to experience these events alongside the characters, not removed from them. \n\nThough the play’s perspective is largely humanistic, many of the themes it approaches are far beyond the scope of individual comprehension. Upon discovering Thomasina’s calculations, Valentine remarks that, though she had correctly identified the concept of iterations, she could not have fully solved them because “there wasn’t enough time before” (Stoppard 55). The human mind simply is not capable of reproducing the multitude of results that iteration equations require, and Thomasina did not live in a world with technology capable of testing her ideas. This incapability reinforces the play’s stance on the incongruity between the chaotic nature of the universe and the development of human understanding. Used as a similarly incomprehensible concept, the theory of entropy is discussed profusely throughout “Arcadia” and is symbolically represented by the degradation of certain characters and situations. At the conclusion of the play, two temporally separated couples are waltzing in the same room. One waltz, a potentially budding romance, is described as fluent while the other, between a mute and his unrequited love, is labeled as awkward. This scene metaphorically represents entropy; the room as a microcosm of the universe, with the dance and the relationship of its subjects having degraded over time. It has been argued that the interpretation of this degradation “as evidence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics operating in human civilization…would see the play as a tragedy” (Alwes 401). \n\nThe symbolism of the waltzing couples is meant to illustrate the scale of entropy, however, rather than personal feelings towards it. The realization and acceptance of humanity’s place in the scale of existence causes the dissolution of social constructs and allows for individual assessment based on the perspective of the observer. This is evident when the final scene is examined even closer, and a second layer of meaning is revealed. From a metaphysical perspective, the waltz has degraded, indicative of entropy, but from Hannah’s individual perspective, this is a moment of intense triumph. After all, she has just been given absolute proof of her theories by Gus. \n\nThe sharp contrast throughout the play between individual perspective and objective reality suggests that the only comfort when faced with the chaotic and arcane nature of reality is the assessment of the beholder. While developing her ideas about entropy, Thomasina laments over knowledge lost to the ages, asking Septimus how they may even sleep from the grief of such loss, to which Septimus replies: \n\n“By counting our stock. Seven plays from Aeschylus, seven from Sophocles, nineteen \tfrom Euripides, my lady! You should no more grieve for the rest than for a buckle lost \tfrom your first shoe, or for your lesson book which will be lost when you are old. We \tshed as we pick up, like travelers who must carry everything in their arms, and what we \tlet fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is very long and life is very \tshort.” (Stoppard 42)\n\nThis assertion of his personal belief is used as consolation for the loss of knowledge, as well as as the resolution of individual mortality with universal immortality. A conversation in the contemporary period of the poem echoes this same idea. Valentine questions what motivates Hannah in the face of a nihilistic world, and her response contains a rationalizing of daunting knowledge through the use of her own perspective. Hannah’s answer mimics Septimus’ in a way that “the play itself performs an act of attempted wholeness, integrating the lives and ideas of the past and the present so that they question and answer each other dialectically” (Wheatley 175) The topic of sex is perhaps the greatest foil to the play’s metaphysical quandaries on perspective, and it is prevalent throughout the play. Almost every character in the story mentions and/or participates in sexual activity, usually depicted as baseless, shallow embrace as opposed to romantic love. This purposeful distinction is repeatedly made in order to represent sex as the ultimate embodiment of impulsive, individual action. It does not concern itself in any way with the metaphysical and timeless and is very personal in scale, a stark difference from the rest of the play’s themes.\n\nThe resolution of the play’s events details the respective outcomes of important characters to illustrate the results of their perspectives. Chloe’s character is the symbolic representation of sex as a purely impulsive act, evident when she is questioned about determinism in the universe. Her character arc mimics this in the final scene where she has engaged in a sexual rendezvous with Bernard which gets them both discovered, something Chloe handles rather unapologetically. The metaphor of her full embrace of impulsive carnality completes when, due to her lack of forethought, she is surprised by Bernard’s callous treatment of her, but still leaves relatively unaffected. Sexual embrace obviously has consequences, but the participants are not concerned with this in the moment of carnality; Chloe’s mild reaction to Bernard’s rudeness is a reflection of this apathy. The staunch opposite to this character arc is Septimus’. He begins the play as a sly womanizer, concerned with carnality over the metaphysical. It is during the final scene, after reading Thomasina’s report, that his perspective of life shifts: “It becomes clearer and clearer throughout the play, however, that it is the discoveries pioneered by Septimus' pupil which destroy the foundations of Septimus's faith. The laws of thermodynamics tell us that the world and the human race are no more immortal than we are as individuals” (Kramer 8). \n\nShortly after, this is compounded upon by the simultaneous loss of perhaps his first true object of love, and he is driven mad by his knowledge of the nature of reality. Septimus spends the rest of his life in hermitage trying to reconcile his new objective knowledge with the loss of his faith and love. Having been stripped of the perspective that had previously given him comfort, he succumbs to the crushing burden of what he knows of the universe. Both of these characters aligned too heavily with their respective ideologies, ignoring information that fell outside of them, and were left with undesirable outcomes. The ideal example of the reconciliation of perspective with objective truth is found in the play’s protagonist, Hannah. The difference in her perspective is that is not absolute in either direction. Septimus ends up wearing away under the psychological weight of knowledge without emotion, Chloe is left stagnant by her impulsive distraction of knowledge with emotion, but it is Hannah who perfectly encapsulates a balance between the two. She is able to recognize and accept the objective meaninglessness of the world, while still finding personal purpose and motivation in her own life. \n\n“It's all trivial - your grouse, my hermit, Bernard's Byron. Comparing what we're looking \tfor misses the point. It's wanting to know that makes us matter. Otherwise we're going \tout the way we came in. That's why you can't believe in the afterlife, Valentine. Believe \tin the after, by all means, but not the life. Believe in God, the soul, the spirit, the infinite, \tbelieve in angels if you like, but not in the great celestial get-together for an exchange of \tviews. If the answers are in the back of the book I can wait, but what a drag. Better to \tstruggle on knowing that failure is final.” (Stoppard 79-80)\n\nCoincidentally, Hannah is the only main character that could be perceived to have a happy ending, and to truly benefit from the events of the play. \n\n“Arcadia” is a play that deals with abstract, esoteric discussion through the relatable scope of human experience. Whether viewed as a comedy, a tragedy, both, or neither, the play’s messages and ruminations resonate with its audience in a profound, timeless sense because of their poignancy to the individual as well as the whole of humanity. \n",
