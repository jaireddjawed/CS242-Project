For example, [this entry](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/AskPhilosophyFAQ\/comments\/4ifqi3\/im_interested_in_philosophy_where_should_i_start\/) discusses how to start with philosophy and provides a great list of introductory books into a bunch of areas of philosophy.\n\n**Resources for graduate school applications**\n\nWe [made a meta-guide for PhD applications](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/wiki\/gradschoolapps) with the goal of assembling the important resources for grad school applications in one place. We aim to occasionally update it, but can of course not guarantee the accuracy and up-to-dateness. You are, of course, kindly invited to ask questions about graduate school on r\/askphilosophy, too. \n\n**What's the flair about?**\n\nOur [user flair](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/wiki\/flair) indicates relevant expertise in philosophy.

Diogenes praises this man as a true philosopher. I don't want to discuss whether this is historically accurate, rather the increasingly sharp divide between mysticism and the field of philosophy.\n\nI've lived much of my life in Thailand where the term philosopher, \u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e32, is still synonymous with a monk or yogi. However, in the West, the terms are almost antonyms. This split made me wonder how accurate is this division in modern times, or is it more about how philosophy presents itself as a field, rather than how it really is lived by its adherents? One example that comes to mind is Graham Priest, who has mystical tendencies but is careful to sweep up any traces of them in an academic context.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678710847.0},{"title":"Why do we make a distinction between Mind and Matter?","author":"BullfrogAlarmed363","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11qeylj\/why_do_we_make_a_distinction_between_mind_and\/","text":"So Materialism believes that the material world is real and anything immaterial like feelings and thoughts are only derivative of it and unreal.

And then to assume that one is derivative of the other, like how Idealism believes that the material world is only a lesser projection of some ideal or how Materialism believes that all thoughts and feelings only happen as a result of processes in the material world.\n\nLike why do we make that assumption to begin with. I feel like we should just go for the simplest explanation, that there is a conscious experience going on and leave it at that. To then categorize it and make baseless assumptions about one part of it being \"real\" and the other \"unreal\" makes no sense to me.\n\nI mean, Occam's razor dictates that the explanation that requires you to make the least amount of assumptions is the most likely one to be true, right?

My (and I assume most people's) immediate assumption is that it doesn't matter what Cruise does afterward, because he has forced Fox into the dangerous situation in the first place.

It seems like \"X is good\" has a different force to \"X is right\", especially since we could make a compound sentence of the form \"X is right, but it isn't good\". If \"good\" and \"right\" expressed the same attitude, it seems like that attitude would be both expressed and not expressed by the sentence.\n\nI like the idea of an expressivism which adopts a kind of emotivism about \"good\" and \"bad\", and a prescriptivism about \"right\" and \"wrong\", since \"good\" and \"bad\" seem to have an approval\/disapproval function (in saying \"X is good\" I seem to be approving of X) and \"right\" and \"wrong\" have a prescriptive function (in saying \"X is wrong\" I seem to be instructing you not to X). But it seems unclear what attitude would be expressed in a compound sentence like \"X is right because it is good\" - approval or prescription? Perhaps both?\n\n(2) How do expressivists deal with modal moral judgements? Something like \"X might\/would have been good\"? Is the modal force of the \"might\" or \"would\" located in the attitude itself, or in the judgement that expresses the attitude? If the second, then it seems like moral judgements would involve some form of description (about counterfactual attitude-expressions), which doesn't seem expressivist in spirit.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678664633.0},{"title":"AI and the philosophy of consciousness","author":"NotLongForThisSite","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11q11yv\/ai_and_the_philosophy_of_consciousness\/","text":"Have there been any philosophical works in the realm of exploring the relationship between AI and consciousness?

Four Views on Free Will. Wiley-Blackwell. ) In the chapter about compabtiblism there is a section where John Martin Fischer discusses various source incompatibilism objections against his  view of free will. In this context he mentions that it is unclear if causal determinism would allow the actitivity that is needed for agents to make free choices (free on the conditions of fischers view of free will). Fischers describes this problem as follows:\n\n ^(\"An agent is not simply a coherent and separate individual or self \u2013 an agent is \u201cactive\u201d in a signature sense, rather than merely or wholly passive. The second worry then is that causal determinism rules out activity in the relevant sense \u2013 it would render us all completely passive. Harry Frankfurt, who many philosophers assume is a compatibilist, has recently expressed the worry that causal determinism might rule out activity; he thus concludes that we do not yet have a conclusive defense of compatibilism.\")\n\n I found this to be a very interessting idea but sadly fischers discussion of this problem doesn't go really in depth and i don't know where to find more on this.

There\u2019s a ton of art, literature, philosophy, music etc that revolves around this topic, not just a single sub, and there wouldn\u2019t be if this view didn\u2019t resonate with people. \n\nIf we\u2019re living in a world where the most constant, present theme of survival is work - where you need to trade a huge amount of the single life you get to just maintain a decent standard of living; where for the vast majority, one of the most important relationships in your life is inherently oppositional and exploitative (you\u2019re never going to get a company that\u2019s *happy* to give you a raise); where the supposed trade you\u2019re making - \u201cwork, and you\u2019ll live well and be able to retire in your 50s or 60s\u201d - seems more and more like bullshit in the current climate; where \u201cyou are what you spend your time doing\u201d, and most of what you spend your time doing is suppressing the things you actually want to do deep down; would it really surprise you if being anti-work was the default position of most people? \n\n*Ok, here\u2019s the actual question:* It seems like people who are *opposed* to anti-work sentiments and arguments will try to counter them by implicitly or explicitly saying that people who are anti-work are weak of character or corrupted by cultural Marxists or something. This seems to rest on an assumption that work is actually good - that everyone is by default pro-work, and if you\u2019re anti-work something has gone wrong. *But I never, ever hear that implied pro-work argument* - just insults. No one has ever actually tried to convert me to a pro-work viewpoint using the logical argument that those insults should be resting upon. \n\nThe other position that I often hear goes something like \u201cLife is a series of pills to be swallowed, and work is just another pill. Try not to think about or talk about the fact that it sucks, because that will just make you miserable\u201d, and damn, that\u2019s also really, really unsatisfactory. It\u2019d be great if the argument that there\u2019s something wrong with not wanting to work was actually articulated because fuck, that\u2019s grim.\n\nDo any of you guys know what this secret pro-work argument is? It\u2019s not like I savour feeling bleak about work. If I could switch to enjoying it (actually enjoying it, not just occasionally palling around with my coworkers, finding tiny bits of it that I like etc., but actually appreciating the concept of working to survive for the rest of my life) that\u2019d be great. But I haven\u2019t EVER heard an argument that it\u2019s actually a good thing - only that, because work is less bad than being homeless, I\u2019m a weakling for not tricking my negative to emotions into being positive or neutral emotions through sheer force of will. Willpower is finite and I\u2019d rather use it to do things I actually find meaningful.

The overwhelming consensus I garnered from a brief search is that democracy is flawed, especially western liberal version. Hence the question raised on the nature and value of democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been lurking at communist threads and often find people discussing the dictatorship of proletariat as opposed to the dictatorship of bourgeosie. My limited understanding is that the votes cannot control the choice of candidates, and are influenced by the advertisement bombardment; plus the coercive economic system that comodifies people's lives for the bourgeosie who gains exponential power from surplus value, rent and interest from the products alienated, creating a power structure where wealth exploits is the vote. \n\nBefore giving credit to dictatorship, I'd like to ask how representative is western liberal democracy of democracy as a whole? Advertisements remind me of shadows in the cavemen metaphor, fixating the audience into stereotype of irrational crowds that I want to avoid; however aside from capitalism, social structures inherently legitimize themselves, how diverse and constructive can democracy be in monitoring itself? How does democracy resolve the contradiction of law of exception? If democracy can only be achieved with a leveled playfield, how important is it? \n\nHow did French socialists and Marx etc come up with the dictatorship of proletariat as a solution towards these issues?

Let me define how I use that.\n\nThe universe began to expand 14BYA. Last night I chose Turkey and veggies for dinner, and a couple seconds ago, I stopped typing to scratch an itch above my right eyebrow. These things are all dependent on each other. The speck of dust which irritated my eyebrow was set into motion when my cat rolled on the floor. She did that cuz she was stretching after waking up. And she woke up because she slept. And she slept because she's a mammal who needs sleep. And she's a mammal because she evolved from other animals. And other animals... Yadda yadda yadda because the universe began to expand. So did I really CHOOSE to scratch that itch? Did I really CHOOSE to eat what I ate? Or are these choices just me responding to stimuli? I'm made of matter, and this particular matter does a cool process called life wherein we seem to experience things. Bacteria does this too and no one would say their response to stimulus is a \"choice\"; they're just little bacteria. Our responses are much more complex, but as far as I can tell, these are just responses all the same.\n\nHow can we reconcile our response? If my neighbor is a total jerk to me, isn't he just matter obeying the laws of physics? How can I be \"upset\"? And what even is \"upset\" besides more chemicals just doing what physics demands they do? How can I tell my neighbor he ought not to do something when he isn't \"doing\" anything? \n\nI've heard about compatabilism, but it makes no sense to me. I either have the option to eat turkey or I don't have that option. I feel like compatabilism is trying to say we have an illusion of choice, like we experience something that feels like free will. But it's really just response to stimulus. Which is just determinism under a softer name, I think.\n\nI guess I'm just saying how can I go around telling people \"be kind.

I want to distinguish my position (an account based on physical processes, according to some definition of *physical*) from the positions of some other philosophers (specifically Ian B Phillips) who, in his PhD dissertation seems to be defending the following account:\n\nIn his process account of perceptual experience, Phillips talks about the idea of *experiential properties*, where experiential is understood in the sense of phenomenal. Temporality is said to be the experiential property par excellence, and it is to be attributed to certain experiential processes. Now, my contention is that in his account of *experiential* processes, these processes cannot be *physical* processes, because his experiential processes *do not* exhibit spatial properties: they seem to exhibit purely temporal properties. They are non-spatial purely temporal processes. \n\nSo, it seems to me, these *experiential* processes are just some variant of *mental* processes and Phillips' experiential properties are just some variant of mental properties. It is important to note that Phillips explicitly distinguishes these *experiential processes* from neurological processes, so that the spatial properties of the neurological processes are *not* to be thought of as properties of experiential processes.

Who is the direct author of the text?\n\nIt's certainly not the human behind the AI, since he only entered the relevant prompt (perhaps he can be considered the author in an indirect sense). The AI has been trained to produce human-like texts based on texts written by actual humans, but it's not obvious that these humans should be considered the authors, not even in a indirect sense. So the natural answer would be that the AI is the author. But does it make sense to attribute authorship status to an AI?\n\nMy brute intuition is that it doesn't, although I haven't exatcly developed reasons to back it up. One argument would state that an author is necessarily a phenomenally conscious person capable of having intentional mental states and that AIs are at least incapable of having phemonenal consciousness (which may or may not be a necessary condition for intentional states to exist), leading to the conclusion that they can't be authors. You could also insist that being an author necessarily involves having intention state, and that AIs can't have those and so they can't be authors. I'm not sure if I'm fully convinced by these arguments.\n\nIn any case, suppose none of the above options counts as the author of the text, and that they are exhaustive.

However, this idea has also become more popular in physics and philosophy. I am mainly interested in time travel into the past. From my reading so far, many physicists believe time travel into the past is at least scientifically possible as many argue that Einstein\u2019s relativity has shown this (I believe G\u00f6del also mathematically proved that time travel into the past is possible). I am not just interested in whether time travel into the past is scientifically or technologically possible (even though it is interesting to see what both general relativity and quantum mechanics can help reveal in this area of inquiry), but whether time travel into the past is actually metaphysically possible. I actually feel like this area of philosophy of time is sometimes neglected. \n\nSome of the arguments I have heard used against time travel into the past include metaphysical paradoxes such as closed causal loops (bootstrap paradox and predestination paradox), the grandfather paradox, bilking (backward causation), Polchinski\u2019s Paradox etc. I am wondering though whether these arguments are really successful in showing that time travel into the past is possible or not. I am also wondering is there a near-consensus amongst philosophers on whether time travel into the past is metaphysically possible. \n\nI also think it is important to mention some key concepts as context for this issue of time travel into the past. These were some of my personal observations that I think is important before debating this question: \n\n*1: Time, unlike space, does seem to have a distinguished direction:*\n\nA) We only go forward in time, not back.\n\nB) We cannot alter the past. We can alter the future.\n\nC)Our knowledge of the past the future is very different.\n\nSo, intuitively, time does seem to have a direction. It is also appears to asymmetrical. But is time really asymmetrical?\n\n*2: Different views within metaphysics about the status of past, present and future*\n\nA) Past and present exist. Future does not. Known as Growing Block Theory (A-Theory of Time). \n\nB) Past, present and future all exist. Known as Eternalism (B-Theory of Time)\n\nC) Only the present exists. Known as Presentism (A-Theory of Time) \n\n(A) Is most compatible with an asymmetrical understanding of time.\n\n*3: Two arguments for thinking that time has a direction*\n\nA) The second law of thermodynamics \u2014 The universe is evolving from a highly ordered state to a highly disordered state. This explains the direction of time.\n\nB) Causation \u2014 Causes do not occur after their effects. The asymmetry of causation allows us to justify the claim that time is asymmetrical. But is it really the case that causes cannot occur after their effects?\n\n*4: Backwards causation and time travel*\n\nA) If we could travel back in time and alter the past, this would mean that causes could occur after their effects.\n\nB) Time travel is physically possibly if our universe is shaped in a certain way (which we have yet to establish). But is time travel metaphysically possible? Admitting travel back in time would arguably lead to paradoxical cases (as I mentioned earlier), and these arguably demonstrate that time travel is not metaphysically possible.\n\n\/ So, does the notion of time travel into the past make sense? Is time travel into the past metaphysically possible?

God's possible existence also seem dependent on mind dualism, as opposed to naturalism or physicalism. This leads us to the concept of qualia, as hypothesised in the Philosophical Zombie thought experiment.\n\nSo, if qualia is real, and the greatest possible being is conscious, it would have qualia. An omniscient being would then presumably also be omniqualescient, and somehow have first-hand subjective experience of every imaginable experience. But this leads to a lot of philosophical weirdness...\n\nIf omniqualescience is necessarily true, then it is surely increasingly absurd, and contradict God's alleged omniscience and omnipotence, as it would mean God has experience of things like curiosity, helplessness, surprise, defeat, jealousy, and all kinds of things an all-knowing, all-powerful being would be ironically entirely oblivious of. He would also have first-hand experience of very horrible and perverted things.\n\nBut if omniqualescience is not necessarily true, then limited qualia still contradicts God's omniscience, as there are evidently things God is unable to know, which can only be learned through first-hand experience, as suggested in the thought experiment Mary's Room. This would suggest that God is fundamentally unable to relate to the human experience, in the same way humans are unable to relate to being a different species of animal. I see a lot of theological concerns in this case, depending on how God is imagined. What does it say about a being's capacity for love and morals if it may only be able to sympathise, but not empathise? How would God be able to perfectly design things that are pleasurable for our senses if he lacks the qualia to understand them? It's very common to misjudge things before personally experiencing them.\n\nLastly, if God has no qualia at all, then he is per definition a Philosophical Zombie, which means physicalism is true, and God can not possibly exist. But this was a weird premise from the start, as God would essentially be exclusively the \"mind\" part of the Mind-Body problem, and therefore be the very thing that has qualia. But, it also highlights the question of how an ultimate being, said to somehow exist beyond time and space, is even able to objectify things as external to itself, as there is nothing outside of itself to relate to. It would mean that whatever makes God conscious, it's emerged entirely from within, with nothing external added.\n\nThen again, as consciousness is to be self-aware, and God can't have an outside perspective of himself if there is nothing beyond God, it very much suggests that God is not a conscious being.\n\nAs I stated at the beginning, I am an atheist, because an omniscient being is completely absurd to me, but also impossible unless mind-body dualism is true.

It is unchanging. Anything that can have an input through a \"sense\" is conscious even at the most basic level such as a thermometer, though it cannot reflect, or even understand it is conscious since it lacks the complex computation of something like human brains.\n\nIdentity is the individuals POV. When I say identity, I mean (inset your name) experience of reality. Your wants and dreams, your individual experience, your identities POV is within your mind through your memories. In a thought experiment, if you were to transfer your memories to another individuals, your individual POV would shift into another mind, as each mind has the same fundamental consciousness, you are simply uploaded to a new outlet tuned into the frequency of consciousness.\n\nI believe we all share the same consciousness which is separated by individual minds, our minds tap into this fundamental ocean of consciousness, though we are unaware of this since we are within our own individual minds and perspectives limited by identity and the physical brain.\n\nMy confusion is how we are able to even write about consciousness in the first place. How is it that I am aware that I am conscious, rather than a silent observer watching a brain that is just doing its thing? Maybe consciousness is a silent observer yet it is unaware that it is truly separate from the mind, since it is experiencing the thoughts and emotions of the being. But then again how would the being even be able to articulate that there is a conscious POV in the first place? It does not make sense to me, I hope this makes sense and if anyone can shed light in any holes and these thoughts.\n\nConsciousness is a byproduct of senses, maybe the whole premise is just incorrect.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678208932.0},{"title":"Do Marxists\/Lacanians seen to abolish all human contradictions?","author":"Hilarial","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11kym69\/do_marxistslacanians_seen_to_abolish_all_human\/","text":"I'm trying to get into Marx and Lacan, and my understanding of historical materialism is shaky.

To me those values feel a bit weird and philosophically interesting. I'm going to explain what I'm talking about with the two examples below. \n\n## Example 1: friendship\n\nI value my friendship with Bob. More than anything else.\n\nI want to preserve my friendship with Bob.\n\nHowever, only in a **limited** way: for example, I don't want to manipulate Bob or trick him in order to preserve our friendship. I'm ready that our friendship can end in a natural way.  \n\nOur friendship is like a \"game\": I want to win the game (more than anything else), but I don't want to cheat, even if I lose.\n\nSo, it feels like a weird temporal and path-dependent (i.e. it depends on the history of the world, not only on the current state) value. And at the same time it seems to be an intrinsic value. \n    \n## Example 2: personality\n\nI value Bob's personality. More than anything else.\n\nI want to protect Bob's personality from forceful, harmful, unwanted (by Bob) changes. \n\nHowever, Bob's personality still can change drastically.\n\nSo, how to describe such value? It feels intrinsic, but it's also path-dependent and changeable.  \n\n...\n\nHow can a philosopher classify\/analyze such values?   \n\nI know, I haven't precisely defined the situations in the examples. I'm just hoping I'm far from the first person to ask those questions.\n\nI guess the most obvious way to deal with the examples is to say I have multiple types of intrinsic values: for example, I value my friendship with Bob, but I **also** value some set of deontological principles (like \"don't manipulate Bob, even if you lose his friendship\"). However, I think such answer is a way to avoid the main discussion: *\"when we value friendship in a normal human way, what do we actually value, what are the essential properties of that value?\"* Modeling the situation with many different values may sidestep this important question.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678193022.0},{"title":"What was the disagreement between Einstein and Henri Bergson about time\/ duration concept?","author":"philosphicalsuicide","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11kbk86\/what_was_the_disagreement_between_einstein_and\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678131631.0},{"title":"Is Kant a theist, an agnostic, or an atheist?","author":"Av3rageNerd78","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11kr5x6\/is_kant_a_theist_an_agnostic_or_an_atheist\/","text":"I have heard many things about Kant being either A) Agnostic, B) Theist, or C) an Atheist.

And how I understand his psychic blindness is that he cannot 'perceive' (I use perceive here not in a visual sense but as sensory understanding of physical touch let's say) his body being touched without seeing the action or doing the touching himself. So perhaps another term would be an 'external tactile phenomenological blindness'. \n\nNow if this interpretation checks out, then I had a weird intuition\/idea about some implication for mental states. I am entirely sure myself what I mean with this, but if a mental state such as an emotion is caused by perceiving some action or object in the world that causes a mental state (so let's say Schneider's body is being hurt without seeing the pain being inflicted which would normally give a normal person the mental state of being in pain, another example would be a verbal insult although I suppose this would never rely upon visual perceiving but instead auditory perception), would in analogy to this his mental state only be able to be affected through literally seeing it or experiencing it rather than an action being inflicted upon him that he cannot objectively situate himself in? Like I said I'm not entirely sure where I am going with this and what the implications of this would be, perhaps it simply means that the autonomy he would have over his mental states (like his body) would be more limited than another person, being more dependent upon his senses than merely perceiving it through his 'body'.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678101231.0},{"title":"Good sources to learn about the social construction of sex as a category of identity?","author":"becomingemma","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11k0a9m\/good_sources_to_learn_about_the_social\/","text":"I\u2019ve been reading Judith Butler\u2019s Gender Trouble where they discuss Foucault, Wittig, and other feminists on the view that sex is often portrayed as a biological reality when in fact the identification of humans through their sexual organs primarily serves the interest of capitalist institutions like the family to ensure the continuity of labour and economic productivity. \n\nI was wondering where else I can read more about the discourse on sex as a social construction rather than objective biological reality.

This has come up in recent discussions about AI, where it seems most people are absolutely certain that AI isn't conscious, yet people will also state that they are certain that animals are conscious, all without knowing what causes consciousness.\n\nMy view on this is: we don't really know what causes consciousness to exist, but I know that my brain has the mechanisms necessary to make consciousness, since I am conscious. It's also pretty certain that other humans have this mechanism in their brain, so I'm pretty sure they are conscious too. \n\nAs for everything else, I don't think we can determine that with any degree of certainty. For example, are cats conscious? I don't think we can actually know this, and I don't mean that in the kind of \"radical skeptic\" way. There are parts of the human brain which are unique to us, and it's not unlikely that these parts of the brain are what give us consciousness. If that were true, then cats may not be conscious at all. Therefore, it is not unlikely that cats do not have any consciousness. The same argument can apply to any animal, or even an AI.

That is a biological fact. But gender ideology on the other hand is much more complicated and \"diverse\". A couple weeks ago I thought that there were three genders identities: male, female, and nonbinary. But I saw a matt Walsh video and am now contemplating the existence of non-binary. I have a good nonbinary friend and their reasons for being non binary are that they don't feel comfortable in their body. They aren't non binary because they like \"more masculine things'. They told me that they are identifying as nonbinary because they feel really uncomfortable in their body, they hate the parts that they have but they don't \"vibe' with the other sex. I was friends with them when they were a woman but an unhappy one. They didn't feel happy in their body but they didn't want to be in the body of a man. They struggled with their mental health and body dysphoria and gender. And it was until three months ago which they now identified themselves as non binary. They told me that they chose to be non binary because they were confused and stressed with their gender for a long time. And identifying as nonbinary felt like a safe place and a safe way for them to identify as while they are still figuring out their gender. But from what I've seen so far with them is that they are happier, more confident, more outspoken, and social. They didn't make their gender identity their whole personality, and they didn't identify as non binary because they like more feminine or more masculine things. They identify as non binary because they are still trying to figure out what gender that they want to identify as.

I'm certain people way smarter than me proposed this thousands of years ago and it's been rebutted and debunked cuz there's no way I figured out something that's puzzled the best thinkers that humanity has ever produced.\n\nHere's my solution:\n\nLet's say that our universe is one of many iterations. The universe expands, contracts over and over. We are in the middle of one of those. Now, if there were infinitely many of those, we'd never get to this one because we'd be forever moving toward it, starting from infinity. Except that we have infinity time to get from there to here, and beyond. Infinity time is enough time to cover infinity universes. Essentially all you'd need is for at least one of those universes to be finite (like ours). You could even have multiple iterations being finite. It could literally be millions or billions of finite iterations. As long as it's not infinitely many iterations that are finite. Essentially, it boils down to:\n\n(infinity - 1) < infinity\n\nIs that a true statement? If we subtract one from infinity, did we, by definition, create a quantity that is less than infinity? Because if so, then the infinity time we have at our disposal is sufficient time to traverse (infinity - 1) iterations of the universe to arrive at today.\n\nWhat am I missing?

Suggestions welcome","author":"deaglerdog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11gr7a4\/where_do_i_go_from_here_suggestions_welcome\/","text":"I have entry-level knowledge of some philosophy from school, but not much.  In my own life, though, I have been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.  I would like to see where my views\/questions fit into philosophy, and what I can read to further my exploration.  If you would be so kind as to read my ramblings, please let me know if you think of any material that might interest me.  It could be Western, Eastern, whatever.  \n\nMy thoughts:\n\n\\- \"I\" exist as pure will\/awareness\/spirit.  I am not physical (in the material sense as we understand it).  I am not my brain or my body.  My mind (ego) comes from my brain, and my brain is part of the physical world, therefore I am not my mind (ego).  I am not my thoughts and emotions.  Rather, I am a spirit experiencing the output of the brain.  But I am not the brain itself, because I can experience the brain and I can direct the brain through will.\n\n\\- Pure will is limitless in its true nature.  But, will is limited by the physical world.  Just as I cannot pick up 5000 lbs because my muscles are not strong enough, I cannot force my brain to do things that it cannot do.  If my brain chemistry is addicted to opiates, for example, then that is just another part of the physical world that my will cannot control.  Our will seems tied to the brain (but how? and is it really?), so if we let our brain go then we are letting go our ability to experience the physical world.\n\n\\- The brain is a tool that automatically generates thoughts and emotions.  As will, I choose which thoughts and emotions to entertain.  Or I can will my brain to think certain thoughts.  Or I can let go of the wheel, so to speak, and my brain runs wild on autopilot with the permutations of the ego.  One great challenge in life, for me, is to keep the mind ego under control of will (not letting the mind run wild with anger, sadness, self pity, etc).\n\n\\- For whatever reason my existence seems tied to the experience of what I call my brain.  I am experiencing what my brain is experiencing, but not what your brain is experiencing, or what any other \"matter\" is experiencing.  This is a big open question for me - how does spirit tie into the physical world?  Why do I perceive sensations from \\*this\\* clump of matter?  What is matter, anyways?  Isn't everything just fundamentally wave functions?  But wave functions of what?  Materialistic science seems to have run its course in finding smaller and smaller \"building blocks.\"  \n\n\\- Is it possible to have emergent properties, or properties at all?  Isn't all matter fundamentally the same?  \n\n\\- All labels, words, concepts, and thoughts are fictions, in the sense that they are all created by minds.  For sake of simplicity I will just call these \"labels.\"  Labels can never be 100% accurate because they are an approximation of experience, but they can never define experience itself.  Labels can be useful or harmful fictions depending on what you want to do.  When you label an object, you are making a willful choice with regard to that object.  \n\n\\- The only thing that is ever actually real is your will in the present.  Everything else is filtered and labeled by the mind.  Every person ultimately always has free will; any limitations on that free will are constructions by the ego to protect the ego.  This is the terrible paradox of human existence.  It takes a lot of strength to view every single moment of your life as your choice, your responsibility.  Most people do not face this fact because it is overwhelming.  They allow their ego to construct narratives to protect them from facing this ultimate responsibility.  This ultimate responsibility is both empowering and utterly terrifying.  But, the choice is up to you how to use your will.  You create your own meaning every single moment, because that is all that is ever real.  \n\n\\- Is this the struggle between soul and sin described in religions such as Christianity?  Is Christianity a recognition that our \"soul\" is pure will, but is corrupted through its marriage with the physical world (understanding that the physical world includes our mind, which generates bad thoughts and bad actions that we otherwise would never do)?  Is this what sin is - allowing the mind to do bad things?  But that salvation is God saying that we are ultimately good, even if we sometimes allow our minds to do bad things?\n\n\\- Or is this just one big construction of my ego?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677817703.0},{"title":"Great thinkers of our time","author":"WKant","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11gltfi\/great_thinkers_of_our_time\/","text":"I've been wondering if there is great philosophers today.

Specifically, it comes up when the way I do things makes sense *only because* it goes against the way people normally do things. I'll try to give an example:\n\nImagine I want to donate 20 dollars to charity and I have two options: charity A, which helps victims of fires, and charity B, which helps undernourished children. Let's assume they both act only in my local community. Let's also assume that, while I'm still choosing, a huge fire destroys a large part of my community, injuring a lot of people and even killing a few. Finally, let's also assume that undernourishment, while present, is not a huge problem in this community. Which charity should I donate my money to?\n\nAll other things being equal (effectiveness of their work, lack of corruption among their workers, etc.) you might say that charity A needs help with more urgency. However, in a situation like this, I tend to think as follows: most people will be aware of the fire and of the urgency of donating to charity A, which means they will most likely get all the help that they need. Meanwhile, no one will be donating to charity B right now, which means they'll be needing my money more. This means that I should donate to charity B.\n\nMy problem is this: in situations like this, people tend to say \"ok, but what if everyone else thought like that too and donated to charity B? Then charity A would get no donations and the very serious problem of helping out fire victims would not be solved! This means you should not think like that\". Yes, it's true that it would be bad if everyone else thought like this too. However, we are (presumably) *not* in a world where most people think like that, and therefore it is no use to me, when deciding what to do, to think about what it would be like to live in that world. If I had good enough reasons to believe most people would follow the same thought process I did, I would then take that into account and correct my own thought process, deciding instead to donate to charity A.\n\nIs this critique of my thought process a fallacy?\n\n(Please bear in mind that the example I gave was just that: an example. The point of this exercise was just to illustrate the \"fallacy\". I am not asking for moral guidance on which charity I should help, I am just asking about the validity of the argument I presented)","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677712657.0},{"title":"Why does Karl Popper say that positing inductive arguments as probabilities does not eliminate the problem of induction?","author":"SpartanGasp","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askphilosophy\/comments\/11fdyjj\/why_does_karl_popper_say_that_positing_inductive\/","text":"Hi everyone! \n\nI was reading the first chapter of Karl Popper's \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery.\" I completely understand his problem with induction if someone claims that induction gives a definite conclusion, say a \"True\" or \"False.\" \n\nHowever, he, later on, says that it would not be any different if we instead posit that inductive arguments show the probability of a hypothesis instead of a definite conclusion just like earlier. I do not understand how Popper concluded this claim and I would like to ask for help. The relevant passage that shows Popper saying this goes like this: \n\n\"At this stage, I can disregard the fact that the believers in inductive logic entertain an idea of probability... I can do so because the difficulties mentioned are not even touched by an appeal to probability. For if a certain degree of probability is to be assigned to statements based on inductive inference, then this will have to be justified by invoking a new principle of induction, appropriately modified. And this new principle in its turn will have to be justified and so on. Nothing is gained, moreover, if the principle of induction, in its turn, is taken not as 'true' but only as 'probable'. In short, like every other form of inductive logic, the logic of probable inference, or 'probability logic', leads either to an infinite regress or to the doctrine of aphorism.\"\n\nIn my understanding, Popper rejects inductive logic even if we say that it merely implies probability and not certainty because to prove inductive logic means having to refer to another instance in the past, which would then be proven by another one before that, and so on. However, I seem to not be able to comprehend why an infinite regress means we cannot say inductive logic works if we say it implies probabilities.\n\nThank you so much in advance to those who will help me.

Maybe for the time he was alive that was true, but I imagine most people disagree with it today and it might not be useful anymore?\n\n* Kant married two ideas that you couldn\u2019t know anything unless you observed it and that you could only know things by deducing them logically in your mind. He, or the people who talk about him, are obsessed with unmarried bachelors, the four sides of a house, and the position of a boat out at sea.

Idk.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s about it.
