        "text": "“At last long night ends, and what does it bear? Me – a sad little creature, with no one to care. Broken and useless, I must now decide, if I will wither away or reach for the sky. And so I rise at the break of dawn. First I drink, then I eat, then I grow strong. Come morning I feel emboldened and new. My growing ambition is noted by only a few. My neighbors all think that I’m not worth their time, but they’ll soon cower with fear when clock reaches nine. I prowl through the wild and seek out my prey, and few are able to run away, with many more deciding to stay. When the sun has not yet reached its peak, I now look over, after the weak. I come to best rivals all by myself, while, to me, dozens of others have pledged themselves, in return for my promise of protection and health. At high noon, I stand both proud and tall, at the peak of my power, respected by all. While expanding my supremacy is still commonplace, few dare challenge my rule; for it’s far too late. While aggression is shunned in favor of peace, I still fight all of those who bare deadly sharp teeth. Yet as the day continues to go on and on, I then decide that little is wrong. I eat and grow fat, hoarding all for myself, much to the chagrin of everyone else. They start to question how it is fair, that they starve below and I sit high above without even a care. I then come to my senses and do all I can, to hunt for their food, but cannot run like I once ran. My people too many and I catch far too few, and slowly I know not what I should do. My claws become dull, and my once mighty roar shot. All others now see how pathetic I’ve got. There’ll be many who strive to take advantage of such, and of my late power, they’ll surely try and seize much. Now I’m but a shadow as night draws ever-near; where I was once well-loved, now I’m not even feared. And whatever last bit of great power I have, is lost to tormenters, leaving me broken and sad. And then as evening comes to an end, I am now starving and worn and without a friend. Lying helpless and wounded with twilight now nigh, at this point I feel that I’d much rather die. The long night has come and predators roam, and now all I do is hide in my tiny cave home. Come midnight, I’m surrounded by many a beast. They act as if they will make me their feast. I cower in fear, tithes I’m willing to pay, if in return they’ll all promise to just go away. Having cowered and begged to avoid such a fight, I may finally then be alone for the night. And now it nears ever closer to five. It’s but a miracle that I am still even alive. At last long night ends, and what does it bear? Me – a sad little creature, with no one to care. Broken and useless, I must now decide, if I will wither away or reach for the sky.”\n\nWhat am I?\n \t\n",

All i know is it has something to do with Ready Player 1, or was at least referenced in the book at some point!It may very well have something to do with 80's pop culture.

He's a nice guy, sure, but ignore his instruction and he will go nuts. But I didn't kill him. I was cleaning the dishes. I saw Eran cooking supper for himself. At 2:00, I went to sleep. Said good night to everyone, now I had some shut eye until Mary woke me up. I saw Stuart, dead. I didn't know how it happen but I'm not responsible for this.\n\nEran- It's true what Elisa said. I cook supper since I had a light dinner. I went to sleep afterwards, but woke up because of the sound of Mary screaming. Stuart is nice, but he can be impatient sometimes. Just one element missing in the meal I cooked and he ordered me to fix it. I didn't want to kill him though.\n\nMary- My uncle had been raising me up for 10 years now. I love him so much. I didn't know why someone would kill him though. I woke up in the early morning, making some coffee. I went down the stairs, and saw the beautiful sunrise. I was in horror, though, when I looked down, seeing my uncle dead. I screamed in horror. I just don't know who did it.",

Good luck detective!*\n**This riddle will remain tagged unsolved for 48 hrs to let others try to guess. ** edit: or not...\n\nInvestigator Redditor walked into doors of the Alyeska Resort on December 23. Someone had been murdered. A man stabbed through the heart. He had been dead since 8:45pm. \n\nHe was escorted to a conference room where sat three suspects: a 27 year old businessman, a 17 year old student, and a 30 year old chemist. Each of them had been swindled by the victim in the past and held a grudge. Each gave their alibi. \n\nBusiness Man: \"He was a rotten fellow for sure. Cost me a fortune in stocks. But still I didn't do it. I was night skiing with my wife. I was so cold. We finished and just barely caught the last Bear Cub lift just before it closed for the night. But then we returned our rented gear at the shop. Ask the attendant at the desk there. \"\n\nStudent: \"He ruined my parents' business, but I didn't do this. I was helping my sister study in the room for her upcoming 8th grade exam. It was about 8:35pm when we went to the pool together. We stayed there all night till you got here.\"\n\nChemist: \"My sister and I drove to the Double Musky Inn at 7:45pm. We finished eating and drinking at around 8:40pm or so, says it on the receipt, and drove back to the resort. We went to our room to watch Netflix. I couldn't stand the creep, but I didn't murder him.\"\n\nDetector Redditor nodded. Upon looking up everything, it was obvious who was lying. \n\nWhose alibi doesn't check out? Evidence?\n\n(If you don't know where to start, I will provide you with hints or links if you ask)\n\nPlease use spoiler tags on any and all answers. And provide evidence for your accusation. ",

Alice and Charlie walk into the room, and Charlie tells Alice a number between 1 and 8. Alice then changes 1 switch (she *has* to switch one and only one switch). Bob then comes into the room, looks at the switches' orientation, and figures out what the number is. Alice and Bob can decide on a strategy in advance. What is their strategy?\n\nWhat I've thought is [spoiler](#s \"that it probably has some connection to modular arithmatics, with some way of counting the switches and getting a number between 1 and 8. I thought about just adding their position if they are on, e.g. DDUDDUDD is 3 + 6 = 9 = 1, but I can't gurantee that Alice will always be able to add 1 to the sum.\")\n\nAny help?",
