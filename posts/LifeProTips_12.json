I had tried and failed to quit several times before and was nearly resigned to a lifetime of nicotine addiction until this book was recommended to me. I figured I had no reason not to try it, though I was extremely skeptical. \n\nIf you’ve been addicted to nicotine, it might be hard to believe that nicotine addiction is actually quite mild, even for heavy smokers. The psychology of addiction is well understood. The book uses this understanding alongside basic logic to remove any desire for nicotine, which is ultimately what fuels the addiction (not the minor physical withdrawal symptoms which are directly caused by nicotine intake). \n\nTrust me when I say it works like magic if you have any desire to quit. If you smoke or vape or consume nicotine in any way and *want to quit*, you have nothing to lose but the cost of a pack of cigarettes and 6-7 hours of your life.",

This makes me seem as standoffish or pissed, but in reality I am just neutral. I don't really smile at people when I greet them...just more of a \"hey\" head nod and a handshake (if required).

There are plenty of stories about thieves who may even be related to the victim thinking someone might have a large amount of cash and someone being killed over it. \n\nSomething you may not have considered is civil asset forfeiture. For most people is it pretty rare to have a legitimate reason to have a large amount of cash. As such it is generally pretty suspicious when someone does, both from a legal and tax standpoint.

Sadly, nothing is a bigger social repellant than loneliness. People don't want to take on your emotional baggage when they barely know you. And people don't want to feel like they are interesting to you purely based on the fact that they are better than nothing.  So you need to get out there and meet people, but as if you already have basically a completely full life and are willing to make some space for them. And when people are friendly to you and make overtures, say yes, but don't overdo it. These overtures likely mean they are somewhat interested in getting to know you better, not in interviewing you to immediately be their new best friend or love of their life. *Remind yourself to take things slow*.\n\n**Pursue your personal interests.**\n\nJoin a writing workshop, take a language class, learn how to throw a pot, learn how to tap dance. If you have time be lonely, you likely have a lot of time on your hands, use it! Activities doing what you love are good for the soul, keep you busy and with a full life, and you will meet people with common interests this way. It also makes you way more interesting when you meet other new people. \n\nThe first point here (above, about being patient and taking it slow) counts a lot in these circumstances. Try going in with the attitude that you are interested in the topic primarily and if you make a friend or two, that's a great bonus.\n\n**Initiate plans with the friends you already have.**\n\nDon't feel bad about always being the initiator with people. Most people are pretty self-centered and kind of glide through life reacting to stuff, rather than being \"pro-active.\" When your friends don't call you, it's not because they don't care, it's likely because they aren't thinking as far ahead as you are, and aren't thinking about that much other than themselves or maybe their immediate nuclear family. And don't look down on being the initiator, it's a great characteristic to have and develop. Initiators are why relationships last. Also, having plans with existing friends makes it easier to make new ones because inviting new people along is flattering to them and takes the pressure off the social interaction.",

        "text": "**TL;DR:** This is in regards to anything you'd like to do, or should do, but can't bring yourself to do regularly. It is better to just do a little bit consistently, even if you are terrible at it, than not do it at all.\n\nI had the idea while flossing my teeth this evening. I never got into using dental floss; my teeth are tight and my gums bleed easily. So I got a hydro-flosser instead and did the best I could, committing to flossing at least once a day after dinner. I probably suck at flossing--going too quick, or not getting every spot--but hey, at least I'm flossing daily, which is a huge improvement already from doing it rarely, if ever. I can feel the difference.\n\nThere are many things that hold us back, especially the fear of failure. But even the master started like any of us: doing it one day at a time, and doing it *terribly*. You may say this tip is in regards to \"discipline\", but discipline is something that sounds very hard or lofty for the layman. Here's the trick to it: you can \"work smarter, not harder\" in relation to discipline as well. Making *any* kind of habit out of something, and allowing yourself to fail and make mistakes, is the start of discipline--and greatness!\n\nI really do think this tip is one of the keys to life itself. So I'd like to share other examples or applications as ideas:\n\n* If you don't exercise enough, doing at least 5 pushups or taking a 10 minute walk daily is a great start.\n* Learning something new, like a skill, an instrument, or a language: just do *anything* involving it, for 5 minutes each day, even if you're terrible at the beginning.\n* Tidying up just *one* spot of your room or house each day.\n* If you don't eat enough fruits or vegetables, eat something tasty that has them as ingredients each day. Or, slather on your favorite dressing or topping and enjoy!\n* If you procrastinate too much: make yourself do just one small task, or five minutes' worth of work, each day.\n* Take one small moment each day to spread some positivity or happiness, or to practice gratitude/self-reflection/kindness for your own benefit.",

I wash everything and spray down the box. Throw their bowls on the dishwasher.

You will pay taxes on the $15000 as income  \nin retirement, traditional retirement money you pay yourself is counted as INCOME, with the SAME TAX BRACKET SYSTEM  \nif you save a shit ton of traditional pre tax money, you could theoretically put yourself into a high tax bracket in retirement  \n  \nwith a Roth, the investment goes in AFTER taxes. which does NOT change your income  \nso if you make 15000, you get taxed on 15000 NOW, and you put 5000 of whats left into your Roth IRA/401k etc  \nwhen you retire, you will take the money out, but you WILL NOT OWE ANY TAXES. so that $15000 after gains is ALL yours tax free  \n  \nso if you want to pay yourself similar amounts in retirement that you make now, ROTH is great, you pay tax now, you make gains, and you wont pay any taxes on the gains. and you wouldnt pay any less in retirement anyway since you’re in the same tax bracket as you were before. it gets complicated if you’re in a high tax bracket now, but plan to pay yourself LESS in retirement. you could shove all your money into traditional now, NOT pay the high tax bracket you’re currently in, then in retirement you plan to pay yourself much less, so your tax bracket is lower than what you would pay now  \n  \nhope this is interesting and informative lol. long story short: blend your investments, and DO ROTH IRA. most people try to MAX their ROTH IRA at ~$6k. the MAX for 401k is ~$20k (~$60k including employer contributions)",
