I have a field that is super interesting and that was began in master program. But I haven't met with these kind of docs in my country.\n\nSo I don't understand the level this plan should be worked out, what expectations do professors usually have in this regard?\n\n* should I clearly plan the methodology and data analysis, sampling? Or is it enough to throw in theoretical background and roughly describe how I see data collection? \n* is it expected that I should be able to do research from scratch by myself, or is it enough to make it  clear that I am aware of the researches on this topic and can logically justify why I chose this particular topic?\n\nAnd another question about the topic choice itself: \n\n* how abstract or flexible can it be? I’m not sure about my research quality (in my uni and in the country they don’t really follow scientific reliability), so all my studies were rather contrary.\n* Is it okay to slightly change the plan depending on the professor I'm interested in? I selected a list of several phd programs and professors, but I don’t  know how my planned research should coincide with their research?\n\nMany thanks in advance.",

At this school, it all comes down to timing because they don’t offer required courses every term. Ultimately meaning that someone will not graduate on time for missing a course or two that’s just not offered that term. Huge matters are left til last minute, days before classes start. Many times too late- creating more stress on students &amp; parents involved than most have been realizing lately. It’s costing students/parents not just money but precious time &amp; opportunities. Some faculty members say/feel that this is not the school’s intention bC it only makes the school “look good” when students graduate on time. (Not logical) This school is no exception to being a Big Business. And students taking longer to graduate, having to repeat classes etc- makes the school’s difficulty level higher. Puts them on the map in a different way, making them comparable to other difficult schools. This is the business side. If the school truly cared about getting students out in time, it would have better oversight on what’s going on with advisors right now. If Advisors are no longer meeting the needs of students, for whatever reason- the school certainly has enough money to make a formal assessment &amp; either split case loads or get rid of ill equipped staff members no longer meeting contract. Trying to cut corners and have 1 advisor guiding an entire Dept of students is outrageous. Mistakes continue to be made, and the price is only being paid by the students.

I've had some short get-to-know-each-other interviews, where the PIs asked me to think about what I would like to be working on or to prepare a research statement.\n\nI find these tasks very difficult, as I am at the stage of finishing my dissertation and I don't really have much time to propose a project in an area that is more or less new to me (I am applying both to labs where I followed their work before, but also to labs which are mostly new to me).\n\nSometimes the PIs tell me about a project they're working on and that this is something that I could work on. Often it's something that hasn't even been published as a preprint, so even if that sounds interesting to me, it's difficult to really prepare anything in this regard. I believe that I would be able to catch on, but I don't want to come \"empty handed\" to the next stage of the interview.\n\nDo you have any guidelines as to what level of detail is typically expected from me and how to deal with this?

But I'd argue it's a very nice bubble to live in, people are educated, intelligent, and reasonable in their views as a whole. I would definitely say it's a nicer place the the whole of society. In fact,\nreading social media actually makes me glad I've never had to interact with some people out there. So do you think that embracing the academic bubble is a good thing? I'll say that I'm young and hence I don't have some of the life experiences others have. I'm just curious about what people think, since I've heard other colleges say they don't like the academic bubble.",

She basically told me (from her experience) that you need to work long hours and weekends if you want to get into a funded PhD program and succeed. I also have an impression that the people here really expect/encourage workaholism.\n\nAt my previous job, we have a pretty good work-life balance (with occasional overtime if we’re chasing a deadline) and still manage to have good results, but I never felt that I’d have to hustle this hard to get into grad school and succeed in academia. I’m still trying to process this change and wondering whether this is a universal thing.",

For example, in a couple pages I did not insert paragraph breaks, so there are literally a couple of full pages of continuous text.\n\nThe reason for that happening was that I actually wrote my thesis in Google Docs, and later was instructed to use a LateX template. I am new to LateX and had to learn it on the spot. So, although I had already reviewed my text, and it looked perfect, both formatting and content-wise, I had to transfer it to the other format in a hurry and could not review it again, but I thought \"I already reviewed it and it was perfect\"...\n\nAnother obvious problem I saw was that in some citations, instead of having the name of the author, it is just the citing code, like:\n\n\\\\citeSmith2009geometry has observed that bla bla bla...\n\nI spent the past couple days crying unconsolably. I have never been a careless student and always got good grades. I had future plans of applying to a PhD, but now I am afraid that I will not be accepted anywhere, as I will probably get a low grade and they will ask for my master's thesis and see my obvious bad formatting and think I am just a careless person who doesn't try hard enough.\n\nIn addition, I now know I will never be able to publish my thesis and it makes me sad because it took do much work.\n\nI guess this is more of a venting post. I just wanted to see if you have any thoughts and how bad you think those errors are.\n\nThanks in advance.",

My supervisor is a supportive person, he fills as much as he is asked for, but not all referees are willing to do so, and I totally respect that, as there is not only one student for which they have to respond.   \n\n\nSo my collegeus asked me give their names instead of my professors.

        "text": " \n\n[There are a few things you can try to make studying easier:](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)\n\n## Find a quiet, comfortable place:\n\n[Find a quiet, comfortable place to study where you won't be distracted. Finding a quiet and comfortable place to study can make a big difference in your ability to focus and retain information. Some people prefer to study in a quiet room at home, while others may find a library or coffee shop to be a good place to focus.](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)\n\nIt's important to find a place that works for you and where you can minimize distractions. This might mean finding a place where you can turn off your phone or where you can block out external noise. Whatever location you choose, make sure it is conducive to your studying needs.\n\n📷  \n\n\n## Break your study material:\n\n[Break your study material into smaller chunks and tackle one piece at a time. Breaking your study material into smaller chunks can help you to better understand and retain the information. It's often easier to focus on one concept at a time rather than trying to take in a large amount of information all at once.](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)\n\nYou can break your material down by creating a study schedule and focusing on one topic or section at a time. It may also be helpful to take breaks between study sessions to give your mind a rest and allow yourself time to process the information you've learned. By breaking up your study sessions and focusing on one piece at a time, you can make the most of your study time and improve your retention of the material.\n\nUse active learning techniques, such as explaining the material to someone else or writing about it in your own words. active learning techniques can be very effective for helping you to understand and remember new information. Some examples of active learning techniques include:\n\n1. Explaining the material to someone else: This can help you to better understand the material and identify any areas that you may be struggling with.\n2. Writing about the material in your own words: This can help you to process and remember the information more effectively.\n3. Asking questions about the material: This can help you to clarify any concepts that you are struggling with and deepen your understanding of the material.\n4. Creating visual aids, such as mind maps or diagrams: This can help you to see the connections between different concepts and remember them more easily.\n5. Doing hands-on activities or experiments related to the material: This can help you to apply the concepts you are learning and better understand how they work in practice.\n6. By engaging with the material in an active way, you can more fully understand and remember the information you are studying.\n\n📷  \n\n\n## Take breaks and give yourself time:\n\n[Take breaks and give yourself time to rest and relax. Taking breaks while studying can be very beneficial because it allows you to rest and recharge. It's important to give your brain time to process the information you are learning, and taking breaks can help you to do that. It's also important to give yourself time to relax and do something enjoyable during your breaks. This can help to reduce stress and improve your overall well-being.](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)\n\nHere are a few suggestions for how to take breaks effectively:\n\n* Step away from your study area and take a short walk or stretch.\n* Do something you enjoy, such as reading a book, watching a TV show, or spending time with friends.\n* Engage in relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation.\n* Get some physical activity, such as going for a run or doing some yoga.\n* By taking breaks and giving yourself time to rest and relax, you can improve your focus and retention when you return to studying.\n\n## Use mnemonic devices:\n\n[Use mnemonic devices, such as acronyms or rhymes, to help you remember information. Mnemonic devices are techniques that can help you to remember information more easily. Some common examples of mnemonic devices include:](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)  \n\n\n* Acronyms: An acronym is a word formed from the first letter of each word in a phrase. For example, \"Roy G. Biv\" is an acronym that is used to remember the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).\n* Rhymes: A rhyme is a repetition of similar sounds, typically in the final syllables of words. For example, \"30 days has September, April, June, and November\" is a rhyme that is used to remember how many days are in each month with 30 days.\n* Chunking: This involves breaking information down into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of trying to remember a long string of numbers, you could break them down into smaller groups (e.g., 1234, 5678, 9101).\n* Visual aids: Creating visual aids, such as mind maps or diagrams, can help you to see the connections between different pieces of information and remember them more easily.\n\nUsing mnemonic devices can be a helpful way to improve your memory and retention of new information.\n\n📷  \n\n\n## Try teaching the material:\n\n[Try teaching the material to someone else. Teaching the material to someone else is a great way to improve your understanding and retention of the information. When you teach something to someone else, you are forced to explain the material in your own words, which can help you to better understand and internalize the concepts. It can also be helpful to receive feedback from the person you are teaching, as this can help you to identify any areas where you may be struggling or where you need to review more.](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)\n\nHere are a few tips for teaching the material to someone else:\n\n* Start by explaining the main concepts and ideas.\n* Use examples to help illustrate the concepts.\n* Encourage the person you are teaching to ask questions and participate in the discussion.\n* Be prepared to explain things in multiple ways if the person you are teaching is having trouble understanding.\n* Review key points and concepts at the end of the lesson to reinforce the learning.\n* By teaching the material to someone else, you can deepen your understanding of the material and improve your retention of the information.\n\n## Use flashcards to quiz yourself :\n\n[Use flashcards to quiz yourself on key concepts. Using flashcards can be a very effective way to study and improve your retention of new information. Flashcards are small cards that typically have a question or term on one side and the answer or definition on the other side. You can use flashcards to quiz yourself on key concepts and test your knowledge of the material.](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)\n\nHere are a few tips for using flashcards effectively:\n\n1. Write the question or term on one side of the card and the answer or definition on the other side.\n2. Review the flashcards regularly, either in short bursts throughout the day or in longer study sessions.\n3. As you review the flashcards, try to recall the answer from memory before looking at the back of the card.\n4. Sort the flashcards into piles based on how well you know the material. For example, you might have one pile for concepts you are comfortable with, one pile for concepts you need more practice with, and one pile for concepts you are struggling with.\n5. When reviewing the flashcards, start with the concepts you are struggling with and work your way up to the concepts you are more comfortable with.\n\nBy using flashcards to quiz yourself on key concepts, you can test your knowledge and improve your retention of the material.\n\n#### [Author Message:](https://learnwithali2022.blogspot.com/2023/01/Study-easy.html)\n\n[Remember, the key is to find what works best for you and to be consistent in your studying habits.

I owe my life to community college and I am heartbroken to see what it has become.  \n\nHomework process:\n\n* Class:  Spanish 101. Asynchronous, online. \n* Several assignments are due every week.  Most are submitted directly to the professor via CANVAS.\n* Once a week, there is one assignment due called a DOTA (Directed Online Tutoring Assignment).   This DOTA is submitted OUTSIDE the class to the \"Learning Center\" (like a tutoring center), to various instructors on 2hr shifts throughout the week. \n* You must email the instructor, ONLY during their 2hr shift, to ASK if they can grade your homework.  \n* If they have the time, they confirm YES.  You then email the instructor your homework and wait for EMAILED feedback.  (Email is the only form of communication, no phone, no zoom).  \n* Once your homework is graded and emailed back by the \"Learning Center\", I must send a SCREENSHOT of my email to my regular class professor.",

I have a publication that was accepted while I was employed as a TT at my previous school, but it didn't actually go into print until after I started my current TT position. I have been told this publication will not count toward tenure progress because it doesn't have my current employer's name on it and therefore \"does not enhance the university's reputation.\" \n\nI did not negotiate to receive credit for previous works, but I have been told by academics at other schools that it shouldn't matter if my school's name isn't on the article - only when it goes into print. Additionally, our faculty code states: Significant credit will be awarded at the time of the item's completion - which is normally defined as the time it goes into print. The supposed name requirement is not mentioned in ANY of our codes/policies/handbooks/etc. Nothing says the school's name needs to be on the article for it to count toward tenure progress. \n\nFurthermore, our faculty handbook states: Conferral of permanent tenure shall be based on the faculty member’s demonstrated professional competence, his/her potential for future contributions -- no mention of enhancing institutional reputation.\n\nI understand this perspective, but here's my big issue: the chair of the P&amp;T committee - the person responsible for this decision - HATES me. (I can provide details if needed, but it's not work related. At all. Purely personal.) This person has been trying to sabotage me and my career since my first year. For example, they and another colleague both attended and peer reviewed one of my classes. One review was glowing; the other was terrible. During the post-review debrief meeting, the other colleague openly stated she did not agree with the P&amp;T chair's negative comments. For this reason, I feel like the decision regarding my publication was made more so out of personal dislike rather than professional reasons. (FWIW, I don't have any animosity toward the P&amp;T chair other than I don't appreciate the sabotage. I'm always nice when we see each other).\n\nI'd really like some advice on this. I think I'm in the right here, but it doesn't seem to matter. At one point, I was told \"regardless of what the faculty manual says, the decision is at the discretion of the committee.\" Does that not sound like complete bull****? Is it even legal to just disregard the rules written faculty manual? I guess I could include this publication in my dossier under \"disagreements,\" but I'm worried that would cause backlash against me. (Which is also why I feel like I can't do anything about my work bully). Thanks for reading and for any advice you might have.",

Therefor I'm looking for job inspirations as a Plant Scientist (MSc) anywhere in the world. My field of interest is plant resistance and biotic and abiotic interactions of plants but I'm open to more ideas. If anyone could help me out (especially job portals for academia and industry) I would be really grateful!",

It is important that other applicants learned about this from the school they applied, not from a third source.\n\n2) Some people may take it as I \"showing off\", making me look obnoxious.\n\n3) I signed the offer and received confirmation, but I haven't gone through any HR paperwork and background check yet. The position will start in the fall this year, which is 9 months away. So technically, it's still not in guaranteed status.\n\n4) Posting about new position may make other applicants who are still on the job market feel distressed. Given how brutal the academic market is right now, I don't want to cause any negative feeling among others. Importantly, I was there. This is my second time on the market, and I am lucky to make the cut. However, in the first time, I do remember how heart-wrenching I felt when I saw other people getting offers from my dream school. \n\nSo, what are your opinions on this?",
