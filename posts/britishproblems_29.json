Here, I pay double and the bins are collected only once every two weeks (one week recycling, one week normal bin).

Pressure trying to force itself through a restriction you see, rather uncomfortable.\n\nA moment later and I‚Äôm trying to work out if the fart was audible.

I had a decent amount of credit and got it refunded, built up more credit, got the direct debit reduced, built up credit through the summer which is only now getting close to running out.\n\nSo the email from them claiming my direct debit doesn't cover my usage and they want to up it by ¬£26 a month seemed a little unusual. I replied to the email and got in one of the most frustrating support email exchanges ever.\n\n\"This doesn't seem right, I'm clearly not using enough to justify this increase. Please don't increase my direct debit\"\n\n\"Sorry, I don't have the details\"\n\n\"It's literally there in the quoted text. Don't increase my direct debit because my usage is clearly covered by what I pay\"\n\n\"Sorry to hear you're having trouble. Are you on any benefits and what's the amount you feel you can afford?\"\n\n\"It's not about affordability, it's about usage. I'm not going to give E.ON an interest free loan when  paying what looks like exactly the right amount and have always been in credit. Don't increase my direct debit\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not a loan, it's normal to always have a credit balance so you're protected through the winter months when your usage is higher. I suggest changing to a variable payment plan\"\n\n\"Really? Because your app specifically says it's normal to have credit in the summer and debit in the winter. I don't want a variable payment plan, I want you to not increase my direct debit because it covers my usage\"\n\nThe sad thing is, this is easily the best relationship I've ever had with an energy provider",
