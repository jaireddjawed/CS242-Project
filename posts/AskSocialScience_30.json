I know I personally believe voter bases are easy to fool because no one has a memory over eight years old when it comes to politics unless you take a special interest in it. I interject into his theory with the evidence that right-wing interests are increasingly trying to reach youth audiences on sites like youtube with people like PJW, Pewdiepie shoehorning in his politics as of late etc. but where I diverge from him, I don't necessarily believe the succeeding generation will be more conservative on every thing simply because culture tends to grow around a person.\n\nSo I guess my question after all this is, do politics tend to shift down the spectrum as generations come of age in different environments?",

In this case, it seems like the \"id\" or the \"subconscious\" desires of humans for in-grouping, hierarchy, etc. has been ignored by globalization, hence the backlash. There was a recent TED talk that discussed the five values that separate liberals from conservatives, and it seems like given how political ideologies always seem rise and inevitably fall, that it's actually about human brain tendencies rather than the \"rightness\" or \"wrongness\" of any particular ideology. For example, with the election of Trump, who really elected him wasn't the KKK; it was the masses of median voters who are pretty much on the fence, making a gut emotional decision, and will swing back next time. It kind of reminds me of the recent GIF showing how ants can form complex structures based on simple rules, as if they mimic molecular interactions. \n\nAll that said, how have social scientists looked at the \"micro-foundations,\" in neuro-psychological terms, of human behavior at the superorganism-level?",

Pink on the negative effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic creativity and motivations and *Guns, Germs and Steel* by Jared Diamond on why different regions of the world evolved at different paces. While reading these i keep comung back to the same question; are technological advancement and IQ proper standards to judge the proper curve for growth in a species as complex as humanity?\n\n\nMore specifically, I've come to ask whether Eurasian populations were ever truly \"more evolved\" than their counterparts or were they simply using a mass system of extrinsic motivation to create a tremendous short term growth that allowed them to expand and conquer whereas the \"slower paced,\" community and tradition-centric nations were indeed utilizing a healthier, more sustainable system focused on intrinsic satisfaction which would have created an environment more conducive to a truly content society. \n\n\nThese questions have come in primarily from reading *Drive*, as it has taught me a great deal about tests behavioral scientists have conducted over the past 60+ years that prove providing rewards for complex, heuristic tasks causes us to focus primarily on the short term reward and tends to reduce performance, motivation and creativity as well as promote immoral behaviors. For some reason though, likely because of the \"success\" of the last few dozen millenia, we reject these studies as nonsense despite the continual replication of results. \n\n\nHas our constant rewarding of work caused our society to become addicted to wealth and lose our passion for life itself and the ability to create? Is this why, after such tremendous growth we seem to be stagnating and devolving into a species more focused on our carrot and stick/attention and reward seeking mentalities than on creating the world we actually want to live in?\n\n\nTLDR Earth currently seems filled by a selfish population with little care for the future or consequences towards other as long as we receive our individual short term benefit. Is this because we've misunderstood the nature of human motivation and growth to the point of centering our entire species on unfulfilling materialism while suppressing true passion and empathy that are required to create our fantasy world or are we simply progressing through a rough patch on our way to the next stage in social evolution?\n\n\nAlso, this is not a question of race but of indiscriminate human motivation and sorry for my thoughts being so disorganized. \n\n\n",

(Two of the top comments were deleted, and the only one that remained, while I agreed with it, was a point that didn't even remotely address the question.)\n\nI was hoping a second attempt, a more direct one, might go better. That said, I do, again, want to apologize in advance if this becomes a controversial subject.\n\nMeanwhile, my statement from the original thread still seems to be the case:\n\n&gt;I tend to run into some pretty difficult attitudes when discussing modern anti-semitism online. I engage with people who accuse me of attempting to build support for Israel (I'm not) or other people who think they're on my side, attempting to latch onto the discussion to try and discredit the very real impact of Islamaphobia (which is an awful thing to do).\nMost of the criticism I get, however, even from other Jews, seem to be the suggestion that Anti-Semitism no longer exists in significant enough numbers to be worth a real discussion.\n\n&gt;I know it's not nearly as bad as it was but, if the ADL's numbers hold up, that means, for the United States alone, nearly a third of the country agrees with the statement \"Jews are more loyal to Israel than they are to the United States.\" It would mean that a fifth of the country agrees with the statement \"Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust.\" It would mean an eighth of the country agrees with the statement \"Jews have too much control over the global media.\"\n\nI've been linked to long, sprawling unsourced political essays on this subject before. Essays as editorials. Essays formatted like academic papers. Essays that paint drastically different narratives of where anti-semitism is depending on the politics of the author. Unsourced essay after unsourced essay after unsourced essay. (or if the essay is sourced, it's sourced to another essay, no peer review or social scientific study involved.)\n\nSometimes the essay builds a narrative where Anti-Semitism is on a drastic incline and Jews need to be on high alert.\n\nSometimes the essay builds a narrative where Anti-Semitism is effectively over and the Jews who complain are entitled and stealing focus.\n\nVery little of it tells me where the **actual** study of this subject is in modern times.  It's frustrating, and stomach churning, in part because so much of it feels speculative. (Or else incredibly vague on anti-semitism post-holocaust) I'm a bit lost, if you'll forgive me. I hope it is okay that I am asking this.\n\nAnd, as a side question, though one I am deeply interested in: What's causing such drastically different answers on this subject?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated. Thank you.",

Basically the labor force participation rate is the the # of people in the labor force / # of people eligible to be in the labor force x 100. I am having trouble finding the # of people eligible to be in the labor force in the data and I'm getting conflicting google searches. Some say that you can just use the population over 16 years old but that wouldn't account for those who are disabled or discouraged from working right? So it wouldn't be accurate? I was able to find the # of people eligible (16 years +) for the 2000 census as well as the ACS 5 year estimate datasets on fact finder but now I'm stuck with the nhgis and the 1990 census pdfs.

Many if not most social scientists have rejected this prospect; any events would be deemed isolated and not reflective of the interests or nature of gay men.\n\n&gt;Definitions (Wikipedia):  Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.  &gt;Hebephilia: ...sexual interest by adults in pubescent (early adolescent) children (ages 11–14)....ephebophilia, ...sexual interest in later adolescents, typically ages 15–19.\n\nThe following statement, it seems, can be accepted as accurate.  \n\n&gt;While it is clear that pedophilia is a type of sexuality, epidemiology and science have shown it is not a type of homosexuality. There is  no connection between having a sexual attraction to little boys (prepubescent) and having a sexual attraction to men.\n\nThis topic differs from that involving pubescent boys. \n  \nWe can note, unfortunately enough, the extensive sexual interest men have for pubescent girls (age 13-15).  We have many anecdotes in U.S history of men in their 30 and 40s marrying such girls.  In many nations today, it is far beyond anecdote: child marriage is common (e.g., Niger, South Sudan, many other African countries and to a lesser degree in the Middle East).  Many cultural factors inform child marriage, but we would be naive to think that (male) sexual interest is not a significant motivator here.\n\nIs there factual basis to assert that gay and hetrosexual men differ in this area, i.e., that homosexual men are less likely to exhibit a parallel sexual interest?   *(I think not.)*\n\nIt is fair to characterize that homosexuality with minors was widespread in ancient Greece?  Are we to regard the Greek experience as an aberration, a one off thing, that has no bearing on this topic today?\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/19a_p1.html\n\n*Edited to add:*  \nI.  I did not mention the sex trade in young girls in places like SE Asia.  Another dimension on the heterosexual side.\n\nII.  As we know, most Middle East countries have very strict rules about unattached women being near men outside their families.  Perhaps these countries have an insight into the problematic nature of male sexuality *(which I argue would be identical for hetro and gay)* that we are not being honest about.",

However, how come that the (ab)usage of young boys have actually been this prevalent;\n\n- Is pedophilia actually so much more prevalent where it is normal to have a young boy in these societies? Where in the west a pedophile is a statistical outlier, it seems weirdly normal that it was known as a word; \"bacha\", \"puellus\". And something perpetrated by seemingly all notable afghan ranks. \n\n- Why specifically always boys? These cultures seem to leave girls (relatively) unharmed. The concept of \"pretty boy\" is especially effeminate, insofar that female words are used like \"beautiful\" and even makekup applied (kohl). And in latin it was the male-ification of the word \"puella\" for girl. The word for boy without sexual pretty connotations would be \"puer\".  \nIf one would actually be looking for  \"girliness\", then why are boys used?",

Probably because it didn't really exist. What are some good sources analyzing these and other ancient legal systems from a critical social scientific perspective? It'd be also nice if the source was open to layman and made comparisons to the modern day, or discussed how legal systems changed over time (a textbook is okay!).\n\nEDIT, for clarification:\n\nI'm wondering (i) how the lack of the institution of incarceration affected the degree and severity of punishments and (ii) what socio-political reasons were given for the creation of the laws of that time. For example, the Code of Hammurabi applied a system of fines for murder cases and capital punishments for certain property violations, like freeing a slave. This code has a class system, with separate punishments. Families sometimes have leeway in determining the punishment, and families are sometimes targeted for punishment (if an owner's ox kills a child, the owner's child may be killed)\n\nThe Hebrew Bible reverses this to some extent, and the only significant class distinction is with regards to ritual purity among the priestly classes. The literal eye-for-eye justice is relaxed. Why is this? What socio-political differences caused this shift? ",

H. Blumer? it does seem that Randall Collins has something to say about this - the concept of an \"interaction ritual chain\" does suggest that a causal relationship between participant's actions is a strong part of how we can have evidence that interaction is \"in fact\" taking place.",

They were socially conservative and nationalists (which was associated with the right) from what I've read, but didn't they use government intervention during the great depression, which is why i think the conservatives make the left wing claim in the first place. I'm now confused and i think it's because i don't have a grasp on what the terms really mean. Left wing parties on average advocate more government intervention to a bigger degree that right wing parties, but that doesn't mean you have to be a free market purist to be right wing.\n\nThis has all made me wonder exactly what the terms left and right mean and how do we determine that, and what political organisation or ideology counts as left and right. What's the threshold that i'd have to pass to go from left to right? Can the terms have different meanings depending on the historical and cultural context? The right seems to think that government intervention makes a group leftist, but i'd heard of conservatives outside the US support or at least tolerate policies like public healthcare and gun control.

I remember reading a study that said when young boys fail, they chalk it up to lack of effort. Girls on the other hand, chalk it up to lack of talent, and that kind of makes me sad. So is this one reason why women perform well in college but don't always translate that success to high paying careers? I'm looking for many perspectives. Thanks!",

I'm not sure how I feel about it, and part of that is because I think it's difficult to determine what counts as \"working.\" \nFor instance, say Dennis and Mac really hate Jeff and plan to murder him regardless of what the punishment will be if caught. Bob and Joe try to recruit Charlie into the scheme, but Charlie knows that \n\n1.) the punishment for murder is severe \n\nAND\n\n2.) Dennis and Mac likely will not evade detection and capture\n\nSo Charlie decides not to take part.\nIn this scenario, couldn't Charlie's refusal be considered a \"win\" for the deterrence theory? And if so, could deterrence work by discouraging additional participants from taking part in a potential crime rather than discouraging crime all-together? ",
