        "text": "I was driving into work today and I remembered a rather abrupt call I had with a client a couple of weeks ago that I thought I would share. Keep in mind our company doesn't do cold calling, all clients give us their number and email address through either our website or our Facebook client. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Hi this is Leah from Generic Shitty Pensions Company, you contacted us recently to discuss a claim on your pension. Would now be a good time to go over it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: WHO?! HOW DID YOU GET MY NUMBER?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: You gave it to us when you signed up for our service. We don't cold call people so you must have given us your number yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: Nah I didn't!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Well I don't know what to say, we don't buy client information from any third parties, you must have either done it through our website or Facebook client. Is now a good time to discuss your pension so we can potentially start a claim for you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: Oh fuck off. \\*click\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm shocked because it's very rare people are that abrupt. They can be stupid or a little forceful because they're stressed, but I've never had a client tell me to fuck off. They give us their details and it's about their pensions, so for the life of me I cannot understand why people get annoyed when we call them. They consented to us calling them for god's sake! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I look at her archived notes and I see that she's been a problem client for over 2 years, continually registering but never going through with our process as well as never picking up for appointments she's booked. These sorts of people show up now and then at my job and I usually don't think twice when I remove them from our system but this client... Oh I took great pleasure in clicking that 'bin off' button.

        "text": "Hey all, story time of a fun little call I had a couple weeks back from a lady who was the equivalent of a “can I speak to your manager” haircut, personified. \n\nI’ve posted on here a couple times before, the company I work for makes software that is for body shops and dealerships, so depending on the day I may get spammed with really nice people who “don’t really know how to use a computer, but can you please help me” or people that just need a password reset or forgot a username. This call was one of those hellacious calls where I resisted the urge to lose my cool several times over. We’re gonna call her “cust” because otherwise I’ll think of something much more rude to call her. \n\nMe: “customer support, this is X”\n\nCust: “You need to help me use ‘the link’” (our software program)\n\nMe: “Sure! Have you used it before, or have you watched any of the self help videos in our support section? Was there something specific with it you had questions on?”\n\nCust: (Begins to actually scream into the phone): “I don’t have time for this, I don’t know how to use the link and you need to help me right now and stop asking me questions!”\n\nMe: “Ma’am, I am trying to help you, but I’m trying to figure out if you ever used the link before, or if you’re a first time user. Please do not raise your voice to me, as I am simply trying to help.”\n\nCust: (Starts yelling even louder): “I AM NOT YELLING AT YOU. YOU NEED TO HELP ME OR GET ME YOUR MANAGER.”\n\nMe: “Ma’am, you haven’t told me what the problem is, how am I supposed to help if I don’t know what you need?”\nCust: “I told you, I don’t know how to use the link and you need to help me!”\n\n(At this point I assume she’s either a first time user or someone who hasn’t used it in a long time, so I prepare to remote in and give her a full walkthrough of the program.)\n\nMe: “Okay, can I get your account’s phone number so I can pull up your profile? I’m going to remote in to help you.”\n\nCust: “Finally! It’s 800-FUC-KOFF.” (She didn’t say that, but damn was I thinking it.)\n\n(At this point I pull up their account see they’re pretty active, having called in a couple weeks ago for assistance with files not pulling through the link. We also just released a major update to our software so older windows versions like XP and vista are no longer supported.)\n\nMe: (walks her through the steps of remoting me in, which normally takes 30-60 seconds tops, and takes us nearly 10 minutes.) “Okay, so I’m in, you have the link installed and running, so what seems to be the problem? You said you didn’t know how to use it at all, but you have it installed on here.” (Her PC is also slower than hell and looks to be running vista, if the 10 minutes to remote in didn’t clue you in.)\n\nCust: “It won’t work! I tried to send a file over but it won’t come into the website and you need to fix it for me!”\n\nMe: “So, when you said you didn’t know how to use the system what you really meant is you knew how, but you couldn’t get a file through...?”\n\nCust: (Her tone suddenly changes as I trail off and let her sit there and think of how much of an idiot she’s being.) “Oh yeah, silly me that’s what I meant! It’s worked up until the last week or so! Btw, where are you located, how’s the weather out there?” (I shit you not, she went to stepford wife cheerful at the drop of a hat. Also, our update came out about a week ago, hmmm.)\n\nMe: “Okay, so we did have an update come out about a week ago, did you happen to download and install it? It would have prompted you to do so.”\n\nCust: “YES. SO TELL ME WHY IT ISNT WORKING.” (Just like that, back to rude and snarky.)\n\nMe: “Let me check a couple things -goes through basic verification steps I normally would have done before wasting my time to remote in, she answers okay to all of them-do you happen to know what version of windows you use?”\n\nCust: “No, I don’t know that, that shouldn’t matter at all.”\n\nMe: “Actually it does, we upgraded the program so some versions are no longer supported.” (I then check the version of our tool and it isn’t the latest one.) “Okay, so you didn’t actually download the newest version of the tool, so that’s why it isn’t actually working.”\n\nI go through the brief process of updating our tool, and lo and behold, it fails and says the operating system isn’t supported.\n\nCust: “That’s weird, we use vista so I don’t know why it wouldn’t work.”\n\nMe: “You just said you didn’t know which version you used, and if so, that’s why it isn’t working anymore. “ (I check the system info, it’s fucking vista.) “Sorry ma’am, your pc has an unsupported version of windows for our program, due to our recent software upgrade. I’d suggest upgrading the pc as a whole as opposed to just installing the new OS. But I can’t fix this for you because it won’t work with our tool anymore!”\n\nCust: (Starts swearing at a man in the background and yells at him to upgrade the pc because it’s too old and she needs to use our program.)\n\nThat was a satisfying end to the call, sorry lady, but even if I wanted to help you, and at this point I definitely didn’t, I couldn’t. \n",

She didn’t say nothing to me, but she pulled my tooth! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Okay, I -  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaller: (interrupting) When she pulled it she said \\[incomprehensible\\]. I still have the tooth.

She’s pulled out a healthy tooth out of my mouth when I don’t have many teeth and I’m trying to preserve them! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Of course, I can understand you would be frustrated if she’s pulled your tooth when you’ve not given permission, but I’m going to have to find you a different number because I *think* you’ve come through to the wrong place... Which company were you trying to get ahold of today?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaller: I just need medical advice madam.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: (Googling relevant numbers) So are you trying to make a complaint about the dentist?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaller: I just wanted to get some advice. I don’t want to be blacklisted and all this, \\[incomprehensible\\] it was just a surprise for me, you know?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Okay, I understand.

He's been stick in traffic for hours due to a massive accident on a major freeway, big enough it's made the news.\n\nMy colleague relays this to the customer - your order is definitely coming out, albeit late, check the news, we apologise for any inconvenience.\n\nThis is where the fun starts.\n\nCustomer: Fuck it, cancel the order. I'm not hanging around until God-knows-when. \n\nColleague: Sir your order is definitely on its way. If you cancel now you won't get this stock until Monday and you'll be charged a return fee. \n\nCust: Nope, cancel it. I don't care. \n\nColleague: Are you sure? Once I cancel this you absolutely will not receive this order, you'll have no stock for the weekend. \n\nCust: Just cancel it. \n\nAnd he hung up. So we cancelled. Driver took the next turn off and heads back to the warehouse. Customer calls back 20 minutes later and gets me. \n\nCust: Just wondering if there was any more information on my delivery? \n\nMe: is this John Smith from account 12345?\n\nCust: yep, the last guy I spoke to said it was stuck in traffic. \n\nMe:... And you requested the order be cancelled. It's already on its way back to the warehouse. \n\nCust: WHAT?!? NO I NEED THAT ORDER FOR THE WEEKEND. TELL THE DRIVER TO TURN AROUND! \n\nMe: John you indicated very clearly you didn't want to wait for the order and told my colleague 3 times to cancel in no uncertain terms. \n\nCust: I didn't think he'd go through with it.... \n\nUltimately he didn't get his order. The store put through a complaint at the corporate level, after much back and forward my boss broke protocol and sent them a recording of both calls.\n\nThey rescinded their complaint. ",

I've also been trained for almost every campaign in record time but now I got thrown at the most basic one that I was actually never trained for and that has ruined my mojo.\n\nAnyways, today I was in a \"contingency\" where basically I was put in a line I'm not allowed to do anything in and I'm supposed to tell people to call in an hour with the objective of lowering call volume for the reps that actually are allowed to work with that category .\n\n\nAfter several calls of people expecting me to check their oil with my tongue and then me stonewalling them I got this call:\n\n\nMe: {Opening spiel} \n\n\nLady: Yes I wanted to know when this month ends\n\n\nI instantly knew what she meant but I'm tired of people who can't be bothered to learn simple concepts and I was currently bored out of my mind.\n\n\nMe:  What do you mean by when does this month end?\n\nI said this while hiding a chuckle from the asshole response that instantly showed up in my head.\n\n\nLady: Yeah I want to know when does this month end\n\n\nI wasn't actually going to say it but it irks me so much when you ask someone to clarify and then they just respond by repeating themselves, so I just said:\n\n\nMe: Okay, but what do you mean by when does the month end? August has 31 days so it will end the 31st and then September will start\n\n\nAt this point I just silenced the mic and started laughing, such a stupid remark, but I've had taken this job so seriously the last few months that saying this was sooo entertaining.\n\nAfter that the lady just finally used the correct terminology and asked when does her bill enter the next facturation period (I'm losing something in the translation here) I just gleefully told her to either call back in an hour or to check it in the website\n\nNo one checks the fucking website or listens to the options in the phone menu where you can literally get this info by pressing 2 buttons\n\nPretty sure she called again and again got told to call in an hour.\n\nI know this doesn't stand to many of the other tales but I just remembered this call and it made me genuinely laugh at 1 in the morning so I thought I'd share\n\n",

I got a phonecall within a few days that I got the job. \nCool. I would go into training for a few weeks and get ready. \nAs I really needed a job and didn't pay attention a still didn't had an idea what my job was going to be. \nDuring my training I started to realise what kind of job it was. \n\nThey were preparing me to become a Call Girl, as English isn't my first language this is what I told people if they asked me about my new job (now I just stick with it because it makes my job sound more interesting), in customer service. \nFun fact I hate phones. \n\nCG = me \nAYFS = are you fucking serious aka the customer\n\nCG: blah blah blah how can I help you today?\n\nAYFS: Hello, you NEED to change my booking for me.\n\nCG: I can look into that for you. What's your booking number\n\nAYFS: XXXX \n\nCG: I'm sorry. Do you have another number? Ours start with a letter.\n\nAYFS: no. This is the right number.\n\nCG: *sigh* \n(of course it is, what do I know about our booking numbers. It's not like I work for this company. O wait, I DO) \nLet me have a look.\nNothing under that number. What's your full name? I can try to find your booking like that. \n\nAYFS: what do you mean NOTHING?\nI paid you guys already. It has to be there.\n\nCG: You are sure you booked with us?\n( It has happened more than once that they booked with the comparator)\n\nAYFS: Yes, I am not an idiot. I booked with you.\n\n**The next 10 minutes I try to find the booking in every way known to men. With no result.**\n\nCG: Would you please send me a screen shot of your payment to us. I'll try to find it like that. \n\nAYFS: *sends me email*\nSIGH I do NOT understand why YOU can't find the booking. How HARD can it be?\n\nCG: \n*opens email. Sees description of payment* Mrs this is a payment to **** they are our affiliates.  Maybe you should call them to ask about your car rental. \n\nAYFS: WHY would I do that?  I don't need to change the car. I need you to change my personal details in my booking for my flight.\n\nCG: Mrs AYFS we are XXXX we rent cars. We don't deal with the flights. \n\nAYFS: Yes you do. It's your number I've got here in the email. So find my booking and fix it.\n\nCG: Did you also book a car through our affiliate? That would explain why our number is in your email.\n\nAYFS: I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE CAR. CHANGE THE DETAILS FOR MY FLIGHT! \n\nCG: Mrs AYFS I can't do that because we don't sell flights.

She will be known as `Becky` (with the good hair and all)^i and the customer will be `ID` for Idiotic Dick. I was there side by side on this call as Becky was. Enjoy.\n\n---\n\n&gt; **Becky**: Hello and welcome to [Bank]. You're speaking to Becky. How can I --\n\n&gt; **ID**: -- You guys are not going to make me pay this silly debt you gave me in this letter. My lawyer will ring you about this! Tell him everything!! \n\n&gt; **Becky**: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me do some security and I'll see what I can do.\n\n*Security ensues*\n\n&gt; **ID**: Oh and by the way, I'm recording this call so I **will** be taking this to court if this is **NOT** sorted out!\n\nOkay, let me just take a break here. If you're not aware, when a customer decides that they want to record the call too (even though it's recorded on our end and can request the recording under the FOI Act), the customer needs to and **must** tell the agent as soon as they connect to one. Informing us midway of the call makes the recording inadmissible in court. He should've consulted his broke ass with his lawyer regarding that. \n\nWhat Becky found out was that this guy had opened two accounts with us. And had two credit cards. He maxed out everything and thereby owed the [Bank] approx. £4,500 cumulatively. He had also opened and applied for these products under false pretenses. So that would be Application Fraud. We have protocols in place for these things. ~~Beck~~ Back we go.\n\n&gt; **Becky**: Thank you for telling me (deliberately leaving out the legality of that). I have found out the issue and unfortunately, the letter is correct. You do owe the balance.\n\n&gt; **ID**: Oh, fuck this! You guys are like the Mafia! In fact, you are the Mafia!!! Speak to my lawyer, he will know what to do! I'll be informing him of this!\n\nHere I wrote on Becky screen on a sticky note of how this was illegal to discuss the customer's account with someone not named on it. it's a Data Protection breach, but of course, you all know this. \n\n&gt; **Becky**: That's fine sir as long as your lawyer is named on the account we can discuss the account otherwise it would be illegal for us to do so. \n\n&gt; **ID**: Whatever, he will be hearing about this! And I'll be telling him how you guys are operating like the Mafia! [*Click*]\n\nSo yes, because people owe us money and we want it, we are exactly like the Mafia. Protection money is something we do too. \n\n---\n\ni) Names have been changed. Was listening to some Jay Z when I wrote this. Becky, if you're reading this, get back to work. The queue is building. Thanks :P\n\n---\n\nEDIT: spelling fix.",

Can't say I've ever been actually threatened before now, so this was a first for me.\n\nA nice woman calls in, she had bought a policy the night before and was calling, asking where her confirmation email was. The email is always automatically sent to the email they provided as soon as they purchase the policy. So if it wasn't sent, more likely than not, it was the wrong email.\n\nNot only that, but she purchased a policy through one of our multi carriers. That means that once they purchase the policy, the quote from us is sent to the other company as a policy. We kind of work as a broker in this way. So only the other company can fix her email and resend it to her. \n\nSo the problem wasn't with her, it was with her husband. Who rudely grabbed the phone from her and started threatening me, and calling me a scammer. \n\nMe=me; RM=rude man.\n\n&gt;RM: You're not a scammer right?\n\n&gt;Me: No sir, this is not a scam, we are a real company. (I've gotten people calling us scammers before, mostly because they haven't heard of us. But we are an inbound call center. They call us. We aren't calling people just asking for their information out of the blue.)\n\n&gt;RM: And what is your name?\n\n&gt;Me: My name is drkrogue.\n\n&gt;RM: Drkrogue what?\n\n&gt;Me: Drkrogue, auto insurance agent for Company.\n\n&gt;RM: Mhm. Mhm. And where do you live?\n\nIt was like he was writing stuff down and getting info to use against me or something idk lmao.\n\n&gt;Me: Our office is located in FL.\n\n&gt;RM: Well I'll have you know I have means to get to FL if you are scamming me. Just know that I am the wrong person to scam. You will regret it. \n\n&gt;Me: Excuse me? Are you threatening me? (At this point I was just pissed. Like sorry your wife didn't get her email, but that is no reason to threaten me). I have already advised her to contact the other company as they have her policy information. \n\nThen I released the call. I was just so pissed. I've been called names, my intelligence insulted, said my company is the worst, etc etc, but no one has ever directly threatened me before. Like wtf?",

        "text": "One of my previous jobs was in the internal call center for a national organization, although this story is more about the way stuff ran rather than a strange call.\n\nThe upper management treated us like peons but gave us more power to cause problems than I've ever wielded before or since. We could remotely access pretty much anything connected to the Internet at any of this company's many locations around the US. That included security cameras, back office computers, and credit card systems. This is not a power that you want a disgruntled employee to wield.\n\nEmployees vented about their frustrations and would joke about what they could do if they were so inclined. No one ever took that seriously, though. Part of the reason was that every time anyone remotely accessed anything, the system kept a log. Someone could definitely do a lot of damage, but it would be easy to trace it back to the culprit. We all knew that it was much more likely for someone to storm out and never return than to face jail time and lawsuits.\n\nBecause of that tracking, it was drilled into us that our computers were to be locked at all times if we were not currently sitting there. Failure to comply was not a defense if something was done under our accounts. Not coming up with a good enough password was not a defense, either. The security of our accounts was our responsibility and ours alone.\n\nThen came the company-wide email that IT was going to do a massive update on the entire system. They wanted us to write our passwords on sticky notes and leave them at our desks so they could log on as us and do them. I asked my supervisor why they couldn't log in with an admin account. He said to do what the email said and that I wasn't paid to question the IT department.\n\nEven still, it went against common sense, much less everything we had been warned (read: threatened) about for that position. I'm pretty sure the employee handbook had almost this exact situation as an example of something that we shouldn't obey!\n\nSo, I emailed the manager of the entire call center, CC'ing my supervisor and shift manager. I laid out my concerns, primarily that anyone could get my password from the note, log in as me, and do a lot of damage. I didn't write it in the email, but I was prepared to get fired for disobeying the order. Soon after she got in that morning, the manager sent me an email. It was another confirmation that I was to write my password on a sticky note and leave it at my desk. She also stated that I would not be held responsible for anything done with my account from the time I left to when I was able to change my password.\n\nI forwarded the email to my personal account and confirmed with my phone that it went through. My butt sufficiently covered, I complied.\n\nMy password was similar to: `IliwmlsIswIl1l!` It meant something to me but looked like a mess when I wrote it out. I actually left notes on which characters were upper-case `I`s, lower-case `L`s, etc. to try to make it easier on them. I almost ran out of space on the sticky note.\n\nI returned to my desk at the beginning of my next shift. A different sticky note was on my screen: \"We couldn't figure out your password, so we had to reset it. This is your new temporary password: `whatever-it-was`.\"\n\nWait...of course they could just reset everyone's passwords! Why was I only now thinking of that? Instead of doing it the simple way, they introduced the opportunity for horrible security breaches.\n\nBut I wasn't paid to question IT. So, I minded my own business and changed my password to something that looked equally as complicated. To this day, I like having passwords that I could tell someone without them actually being able to use it.\n\nAlso, the IT department never had us put our passwords on sticky notes again while I was there. I like to think that they didn't realize they could reset our passwords until they couldn't figure mine out, even when given copious notes.",

Most of the time it was because they owed us money or they didn't get their trash out on time, but if it was neither we would make attempts to pick it up again. This wasn't one of those cases.\n\nThis guy is yelling at me to come pick up his trash. He was behind on his bill but he JUST paid it a few minutes ago, so yay that's great he's paid up now, but we're not going to make a return trip just because he didn't pay his bill until he noticed his trash wasn't being picked up. Return trips cost the company between $50 - $100, so because it was his fault in the first place, he was going to have to pay the $75 return trip fee, or wait until next week.\n\nCustomer: I AM NOT GOING TO PAY EXTRA TO HAVE MY TRASH PICKED UP. I ALREADY GAVE YOU YOUR GODDAMN MONEY. AND IT'S THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE STINKING GARBAGE SIT HERE FOR A WEEK.\n\nMe: I'm very sorry for this, sir, but I wouldn't be able to send the driver back out for you.\n\nCustomer: Yes, you will, or I'll dump it in the parking lot in front of your office. How would you like that?\n\nMe: (unphased because I'm not even in the same state) Sir, I don't recommend it, because that would be a felony and we have cameras.\n\nThen he asked for a supervisor, who also wouldn't authorize the pickup. I wonder if he ever followed through.",

I do everything I can for a customer - and with a smile. I understand people have shitty experiences for various reasons. But I always have done all I can to make the situation better. So when a customer comes up at me with *that* tone of voice, it drives me up the wall. I am a person too. I deserve respect just as you do. I'm a stranger who is trying to help you. I am so happy I do not have to deal with people who don't realize this and seem to go out of their way to make me inferior.\n&amp;nbsp;\n- No more being told I am going to the bathroom too often. (There is that micro-managing and the whole stripping of freedom thing I mentioned earlier!)\n&amp;nbsp;\n- No more slow, repetitive, monotonous work, slowly tearing away at my sanity.\n&amp;nbsp;\n- No more being forced to \"respect\" those managers that least deserve it - those who are clique-y, downright rude, immature, and honestly just fucking stupid. How did they get to where they are? Kissing ass. A lot. I'm glad I don't need to be around these managers where, this is the best job they have or ever will have, and they are so blind to the meaninglessness of it all that they power trip over their team.\n&amp;nbsp;\n- No more burnout.\n&amp;nbsp;\n- No more lack of career development. \n&amp;nbsp;\n- No more backstabbing employees who rat you out any time you go fill your water bottle and you are not on a break. Honestly, why \nthe fuck do you care Karen?\n&amp;nbsp;\n- No more working in an oppressive, stressful, and exploitative environment all under the guise of \"motivation\" and \"goals/targets\". \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, I don't mean to be bitter or negative as I know I have come off in this post. I'm a positive person, but this job has totally ran me down over the years. And, yeah, I know some of these things I've listed will still happen, as they can working at any job. But the stuff I have listed, which most people working in a call center know, is the culture of a call center; it is the epitome of what you go through every day. It's demoralizing. It crushes your self-esteem. They have high turn-over for many reasons. Now, it wasn't all bad as I learned some important \"skills,\" met my wonderful boyfriend of two years now here, and it doesn't look terrible on a resume where customer service is required (which it typically is in some way or another). However, I do hope that, for the sake of everyone and anyone who has had the displeasure of working in a call center - you can get out as soon as possible.

This was the conversation that ensued:\n\n\nM = Me \n&amp;nbsp;\nLC = Lying Customer\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nM: Hi, thank you for calling [BANK], my name is [NAME]. *blah, blah, blah intro, names, verification process* How can I assist you today?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLC: *instantly angry* Uh, yeah, hi. I just logged onto my online account and noticed that you put a charge back on my account that I didn't make and told you guys that it was fraud already. Take this off of my account, NOW.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: Oh, I understand! Let me just take a look at your account. One moment, please!\n[Now, I instantly recognized this account from just a couple of days ago so I just read through the notes really quickly as a quick reminder and to try to compose myself as you could tell she was a total asshat.]\nThank you for holding. Yes, the $1,200 Air BnB charge I see was reported fraud but it looks as if, through our own investigation with the merchant, we have come to the conclusion that the charge is actually valid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLC: Well, I never made any charge with Air BnB and definitely not for that amount so you need to take that charge off now or I am going to report YOU for fraud.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: You see, we received documentation from the merchant and here is what we can essentially conclude: the phone number, email, address, and name on the hotel reservation are all the same as what is on your credit account here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLC: OK. So, someone stole my information, obviously.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: I can also see that the hotel was booked for in Chicago, IL for 06/06/2018-06/09/2018. Taking a look at your account, all the charges made during that time frame were in Chicago, IL AND you had called to put a travel note on the account letting us know you'd be out of state. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLC: I didn't see those charges! It sounds like there is even more fraud on the account as I thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: Well, except I actually did listen to the call where you had set up the travel alert with us and I can 100% confirm it was you calling in to let us know of your travel to Chicago, IL. Your voice was on that recording ma'am. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLC: This is absolutely *f'ing* ridiculous and you have absolutely no right listening to my PRIVATE calls. I could sue over this. I could sue over the fact that you are committing fraud against me, making all this information up to make ME look like the bad guy. I demand to speak to your manager NOW. (She is screaming at this point.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: Ma'am, unfortunately we aren't able to accept your fraud claim. Not a manager or anyone else at this bank will be able to override that decision and that is BECAUSE, in addition to what I have already told you, in the documentation the merchant sent us, they also sent a front/back copy of your driver's license - the identification the hotel required for you to check in.

        "text": "Sorry for my bad English. TL;DR: Some fraudsters are just lucky.\n\n\nSo, I used to work as a T3 customer service agent for a computer company. Once a customer reached us, we had to work with them until the issue got resolved. Corporate was the only level above us and they only took the worst cases, so I had the power to bend the rules (freebies, repairing out of warranty, replacing computers etc) if we felt the case deserved it.\n\n\n\nThe story begins with me taking a live escalated case, we will name our friendly customer Ms. Beelzebub. Being honest Ms. Beelzebub never got furious during our calls, she always had that happy welcoming voice of a succubus. Ms. Beelzebub got escalated because she dropped her laptop and a truck run over it by “accident”. She had accidental protection plan on it but didn’t want to send it over to repair, she wanted a new one.  I explained to her that the policy noted that she had to send it to the repair center first, in case the center found the computer unfixable we will replace the laptop with a new one. After an hour of so of soft skills and prayers she bends the knee and accepted to send the computer to repair. \n\n\n\nPrevious similar cases indicated that the repair center would dictate the computer will be too expensive to repair and we would have to replace the computer. So, I started doing all the paperwork for the replacement, at that time I didn’t know what that sign “Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate” meant when I passed that door. One of the steps is to check in the system if the customer had any previous replacements and she did, this was her 3rd replacement. The past 2 replacements had similar fate, one was dropped into the pool by accident, the other she spilled coffee on it. I noticed that previous agents had upgraded her processor, give more memory and extended her warranty for “customer satisfaction”. So from her mid-level computer she now had a high-end gaming computer. Man that was going to hit my budget but luckily this was just her 3rd replacement and I needed no approval from corporate to replace it, or so I thought. \n\n\n\nI waited for the laptop to hit the repair center and send out the paperwork to our approvers. Next day I come with the request denied because this was going to be the 4th replacement. Our approver found out the first replacement in an old system that we no longer use, so now I had to get approval from corporate to replace it. It was obvious Ms. Beelzebub was running some fishy business here. Luckily, I got the approval without much fuzz with one big exception NO MORE EXTENDED/ACCIDENTAL WARANTY FOR MS. BEELZEBUB. So, I re did all the paperwork and got it approved it this time. Now it was just time to get the notification from the repair center that the computer had to be replaced. But Instead a got a call from Ms. Beelzebub telling me that she got an email stating her computer was repaired successfully and it was being shipped back to her.\n\n\n\n“Unacceptable, I’m going to refuse the package, not going to take a repaired broken computer, etc. “. I was just shocked the center repaired a run over laptop. Did God finally listen to my prayers all the way from the 3rd circle? “Ms. Beelzebub, lets wait for you to get the laptop, if its not up to your standards, I’m sure we can work something out.” She agreed but she was not happy. While the laptop was in transit with FedEx, I was giving the task to excommunicate her in the system by adding in the title of all her cases “DO NOT GIVE EXTENDED WARRANTY TO CX’. Couple of days passed and FedEx tracking show no progress, package was in FedEx possession in a distribution center. I called FedEx and I got the unpleasant news: Package was lost in transit. Bollocks.\n\n\n\nOf all the packages, you decide to lose this one FedEx? I call Ms. Beelzebub to bring the bad news and she was happy to hear it, good news for her I guess, she is now getting a replacement. So more paperwork for me now since the reason of the replacement is different. Then it turns out the replacement computer I found similar to her laptop is now out of stock, so now I have to build a new one. Her laptop had Blu-ray WRITER so its difficult to find one. Time to negotiate with Ms. Beelzebub, she is not happy we don’t have a laptop with all the previous specs. Who uses Blu-ray writer anyways? Plus she was expecting to get the extended warranty. HAHAHAHAHA, No! What was her first computer you may ask? A $200 Amd dual core , 2gb RAM, 320 gb hard disk which has now become after 4 replacements a  $1800 intel i7 quad core, 12 gb RAM, 1 tb hard disk, nvidia graphic card, 3d 120hz screen plus an external Blu-ray reader. She finally accepts my offer, the laptop gets shipped and she gets it. Thank God is finally over!\n\n\n\nNOT! Ms. Beelzebub gets the new laptop and complains that the new laptop feels “cheap” and she wants something to make it up, spoiler alert *an extended warranty*.  No Ms. Beelzebub I can not give you that, so she keeps insisting and wants to speak to a supervisor, my supervisor (another t3) is aware of the whole story and for “customer satisfaction” (more like shut up and end this already) we give her a free Office 365 1 year subscription. The case can now be closed after weeks of descending into the circles of hell and now you are wondering, is it over??? And I tell you with a broken voice: Not yet, we are barely in the 4th circle (Greed).\n\n\n\nJust kidding, the story is almost over because I had little to no interaction with Ms. Beelzebub after closing the case, but that didn’t mean she would stop tormenting more poor souls. She kept calling to complaint about performance, overheating, the screen not bright enough, no enough sulfuric acid in the air. A well trained agent will look for the previous cases and determined they were talking with a daemon, but then one day the apocalypse happened. One of her many calls were routed to a different call center (and also different outsourcing company) and she was offered for “daemon satisfaction” the forbidden fruit, the illegal indulgence, the immoral pleasure, the big no-no, an extended accidentally protection plan for THREE LONG YEARS FOR FREE. A was shocked, but at least it was not my problem any more.\n\n\n\nI was about to move up to a higher position, when a poor soul came to me and told me what had happened. Since I was no longer taking calls, my coworker will have to deal with the problem. Only God can tell us how the touch pad stopped working in Ms. Beelzebub’s laptop, but she did not want to send the laptop to repair because it was “less than 6 months old and deserved a new one”. I gave my coworker my condolences and wished good luck, but I knew it was going to be a rough, bumpy, hellish ride.\n\n\n\nOur story now has come to the end. Months after in my new position I became curious to see how our antagonist was doing. It appeared that she had won another battle and devoured that poor soul I had for a coworker. She now had a new laptop because she accidently cracked the screen of the previous laptop. God works in mysterious ways.\n\n \n",

        "text": "Why do fraudsters think they can circumvent account closure when they've been found guilty? Like, we will close your account. You can fool one person, maybe. You can't fool an entire department of 500+ fraud investigators. Anyway, enjoy this tale. I will be `ME` and `Fraudster` will be the caller.\n\n---\n&gt; **ME**: [*beep*] Hello and welcome to [bank]. You're speaking to Peace. How can I help?\n\n&gt; **Fraudster**: Yeah, so I got a letter from you people. It says I have to pay this balance. This is silly. I'm not paying!!!! The case reference is ABC123.\n\nAnd that was the first flag of this call being a frustrating one. After completing security, I take a look at the case. Turns out that this (now ex, but not at the time of the call) customer had £15,000 paid into his account by fraudulent means (that I will not be sharing). \n\nHe then transferred £10,000 out to an account that belonged to another bank. It took the investigators about a day, if that, to notice the funds so we did what any other bank would do in this situation. Blocked access to his account, so that any transactions would need him to go to a branch. Oh, and also rang the other bank to inform them of the fraudulent funds. That account got stopped too. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Sorry to hear about this ordeal, sir. It looks like the balance in question is the overdraft that you have gone into. Let me explain. On [date x] there was a card payment for £10.00 to A Supermarket. That put your account overdrawn to the amount of £600 that is on the letter. \n\n&gt; There have been card payments prior to this that has lead to the amount stated in the letter. On [date y] there was a payment in to the account for £15,000 and on the same day you transferred out £10,000. This has been investigated as fraud and thereby your account is getting closed. You would have got a letter about this. You still have to pay the overdraft, sir because this is owed from [date x] which was before the payment coming in.\n\n&gt; **Fraudster**: What?! I didn't even make those card payments! Or the transfers! \n\nAll this were nothing but lies of course. I checked the IP of the transfers and the device make/model. He had registered for our app. On the same device the transfers were made. I could've told him all this,, but chose not to get into another argument. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Okay sir. Unfortunately, the payment in to your account and subsequent transfers out are already investigated. The decision still stands. As for the card payments, which ones are we talking about?\n\n&gt; **Fraudster**: All of them!\n\n&gt; **ME**: Yes sir. But since when?\n\n&gt; **Fraudster**: Since the past couple of months!!\n\n&gt; **ME**: Yes, but I need a start date to get them all raised for you sir.^1 \n\n&gt; **Fraudster**: The past six months if you must be so pedantic!\n\n&gt; **ME**: So February?\n\n&gt; **Fraudster**: Yes!!\n\nWith that bit of information, I proceeded to put the customer on hold whilst I raised every single card payment as fraud. Approx. 60% of them were made by entering the PIN. Yeah suffice to say he isn't getting anything. His account is still going to be closed. He can bank elsewhere. \n\n---\n1) Because procedure states that we still have to raise them. ",

        "text": "I work for a large cell phone company in the U.S. and we have implemented a new experience for our customers where we only handle calls from a specific market of customers. So this means that my team only handles a specific group of customers so that way they always get to talk to the same groups of reps each time they call in. \n\nThis helps to keep us more accountable with the information we provide to customers in the way that if I give info and the customer calls back talking about it, then the person sitting next to me who got the call can confront me and ask about what I said. It also serves to provide customers with a consistent experience no matter who they talk to....for example:\n\nM= Me\n\nIC= Incompetent Customer\n\nM: Thanks for calling *blah blah intro*, how can I help?\n\nIC: my services are suspended and I want to know why!\n\nM: oh no, well let’s take a look and figure that out! Looking here I see we have a past due amount of over $450 that was due a little over a month ago, did you want to make a payment for that today?\n\nIC: What?! How is my balance that high?! I only have 2 lines on my account and paid not too long ago!\n\nM: *Informs IC that he hasn’t paid for 2 months and has restoral fees for being suspended on top of his two iPhone X’s that he is financing with a bunch of accessories (very expensive)*\n\nIC: Oh ok, well I shouldn’t have to pay those restoral fees, I was out of the country!\n\nM: Well did you contact us to put a temporary suspension on the lines when you left?\n\nIC: No...\n\nM: Well I’m sorry but those fees are valid as that was not done and you were making phone calls outside of the country using your services anyway.\n\nIC: Well they need to be waived or else I won’t pay\n\nM: Sir, I see here that we have waived your restoral fees 3 times this year alone already which is excessive as each customer is only allowed one waive per the life of the account. So the fees stay. If you don’t wish to pay then your services won’t be turned back on.\n\nIC: whatever, I’ll call back and get someone else to do it. *click*\n\nM: *Memos the account and gets ready for the next call*\n\nRING RING\n\nM: Blah blah intro, how can I help?\n\nIC: I just talked with u/powdydoody and we talked about getting my restoral fees waived. Can you do that for me?\n\nM: Sir, that was me you just talked with. Whenever you call in you get to the same team so you’ll get me or someone sitting next to me who can see my notes each time. The restoral fees stay no matter who you talk to.\n\nIC: oh ok, I actually just wanted to see how much my bill was, I forgot\n\nM: *thinking: sure, good excuse. Gives bill balance and call disconnects*\n\nRING RING\n\nM: intro intro intro, how can I help?\n\nIC: Were we just talking?\n\nM: Yes, it’s me. The answer will be the same. You can call us when you want to pay but the fees will be on there.\n\nIC: THIS IS BULLSHIT!! *click” \n\n\n\nI put notes all over the account saying what happened and he got flagged as a repeat caller. If he keeps calling about that he can be put on paper correspondence only so we’ll see what happens. This was a rather satisfying experience for me as I got to repeatedly own the no on what seems to be a consistent credit abuser (always asking for credits). \n\nSome people don’t understand that you have to pay for phone service. It’s not a right, but a privilege. We give ways to extend bills up to 28 days past the due date and this customer had exhausted all options.  \n\n\nThanks for reading!",

When these things happen we look into why - COB needs to be updated or we need medical records, etc. Sometimes, though, we get misrouted calls for people that don't even have our policy and just like to hear themselves talk. I looked into it and discovered she didn't have our plan until the first of January this year but she did not want to hear it. \"If I off myself, my family would sue you people and they would own that hospital!\" she informed me. I told her that I was sorry to hear that but I had no claim on file and the start date of this policy wasn't until 2018, but she just kept going. She even interrupted me to yell at her husband for not watching the cats properly and then when I fell silent and just got resigned to her rambling because we're not allowed to hang up unless the callers expressly call us names/abuse us she realizes: \"Oh, my husband gave me the wrong damn insurance card, I was supposed to call \\[different insurance company\\], you should've stopped me\". I am SO GLAD that I have another job lined up now!\n\nTLDR: Woman calls us screeching about how we denied her claim and the hospital is sending her a bill when we're not the insurance company responsible.",

I did wireless chat and holy shit if anyone is with totally-not-Rogers you should put a pin on your account because account take overs is RAMPANT. You should know that when you chat in we can see all your previous chats and we can also see what kind of device you're chatting in on so when it's fraud it's easy to tell. (You should also know that just because we think it's fraud, were encouraged to make the sale anyway. Then we send a ticket off to the fraud team which can take weeks for them to cancel the order and refund the account) Myself would never make the sale because of obvious moral objections and the fact I did not care if I lost the job because we were under paid and overwhelmed. So ANYWAY\n\nMe: thank you for choosing totally-not-rogers! How can I help you?\n\nCX: I want the iPhone x 256gb without changing my plan\n\n-goes to account, sees it's owned by 70 year old on a $20 talk and text plan from 2007-\n\nMe: unfortunately our contracts are only two years long and there's no way we could make our money back if we give it to you at this price\n\nCx: fine give me 30gb premium plus plan for $200\n\n-check his chat history,chatted in under 40 different names on accounts from all over the country-\n\nMe: okay before we get started, I sent you a text to your phone . Can you please verify the 4 digit pin I sent you?\n\nCX: my phone is broken!!\n\nMe: oh that's weird, it shows that you're chatting on your phone right now\n\nCX: just sell me the phone!\n\nMe: I'm afraid that since you chatted in under 40+ names within the past few weeks from different cities, I can't sell you the phone unless you pass the additional security prompt\n\nCX: this is a shared laptop everyone in the house uses..\n\nMe: so you're just mailing your laptop around from province to province to order phones?\n\n-cx disconnected-\n\nYeah...I'm glad our center got shut down. About 1/4 \"customers\" were people who took over an elderly persons account and stole high end phones..",

        "text": "Okay so bit of information, I work for a bank call center. Occasionally I will get calls where someone has a garnishment on their account. \nBasically, they lost some type of court case where the plaintiff is owed funds, or in this case, overdue taxes. We are served with papers, that make us hold the funds on an account. \n\nHere is today’s great adventure. \n\n\nGuy calls in because there is a hold on his checking account for $220.00. Which is the exact amount he has in his account. \nThere is an account note saying that there was a legal levy/garnishment, with a number to call and whom the garnishment was from.   \nSo I tell him. He says he doesn't owe the Tax Board. \nI say \"Well it could also be your co-owner, [name]. Allow me a moment to call legal and I'll find out for you.\"   \nTurns out it is his co-owner.   \nI come back and tell him \"It's for [co-owner.] So you need to have her call the tax board. Do you want the number?\"   \n...I give him the number....   \nHim \"Is there a reference number?\"\n\nMe \"No, they don't give us that information. Just have her call them and they will be able to find her, probably with her social. They will let her know everything.\" \n\nH \"I don't think this is real I think it's fraud!\" \n\nM \"No Sir, this is real. The bank was served with a legal court order, signed off by a judge to put a garnishment on this account.\" \n\nH \"No! There is no way, I never gave them my account number they wouldn't know it.\" \n\nM \"Sir, they are the government, they have a way to find where you bank. That is what they have done.\"\n\nH \"Yea but they took the exact amount in my account! How would they know what's in it?!\" \n\n(She had to have owed more, and we just gave them all of what’s in the account. I didn’t ask legal how much she owed, because we can’t tell him what the court order says because it’s against her. Even though he’s on the account and all of this is public record, but my company is awesome.) \n\nM \"We had to give them all that was in the account. She probably owes more. Just have her call the number and they will tell her everything.\" \n\nH \"The IRS doesn't do phone calls! This number is fake!\" \n\nM \"No. It's not fake. This is also the local tax board, not the IRS. You can call them. Google it, it will bring you right to CA.gov.\" \n\nH \"I'm going to call it right now! Hold on let me call it!\" \n....waiting.... \n\nH \"Yea! This is fake! It says recovery service!\" \n\nM \"Sir. I promise you it is real. It is a legal order from the government. Within 10 business days there will be a letter from the bank explaining what is happening with all the details.\" \n\nH \"Can't you just give me my money back?! It's a mistake!\" \n\nM \"No Sir, we would be breaking the law if we went against a court order.\" \n\nH \"But I don't owe them anything.\" \n\nM \"Well again, it is for [co-owner] not you.\" \n\nH \"We file together. She couldn't owe anything if I don't.\" \n\nM \"Okay, well have her call. She can get all the information and if it's a mistake they will refund your money.\" \n\nH \"You are absolutely no help.\" *hangs up*\n😒\n...sorry, next time I'll break the law for you. \n \nI get most frustrated because I get surveys on these calls and I am supposed to be at 90% satisfaction and this asshat is going to score me poorly, bringing down my metrics. \n\nThis is also the abridged version. He said the number was fake about four times, asked me for a reference number at least three times, told me at least ten times they don’t owe anything and that it was “fraud” more times than I can estimate. \n\nI know that getting something like this on your account can be a big shock, and stuff happens and people fall behind. I have no judgement on that. I get that it’s confusing, infuriating and scary. \n\nI was at my wits end though,  I had to have instructed him to have his co-owner call  at least 20x “again, we don’t have that information she would have to call them.” “I understand, just have her call them. They can look into it.” ",

        "text": "So for those who don't know what the Peter Principle is, please feel free to read the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle). In short, it's when you find that the higher up in management you go, the less competent workers get at doing their job. A recent case, that has now finally been closed and taken care of, reminded me of this and I can tell you I was (and still am, a little bit) royally pissed off. The incompetency that some of my colleagues have is astounding.\n\nThe Cast:\n\nMe: Me\n\nRD: Richard Dick. My Colleague (in a higher paid position than me in the office, and also a Dick)\n\nSM: Superman. My colleague in the branch\n\nVKL: *Very* Kind Lady. Our Customer\n\nTLDR at the bottom.\n---\n\n&gt; **ME**: [*beep*] Hi there. Welcome to [bank]. You're speaking to Peace. How can I help you today?\n\n&gt; **VKL**: Oh hello dear. I'm just trying to order some medicine but it won't let me do it over the phone. It's how I've always done it. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Oh that's not good! Let's do some security and see what we can do for you. \n\nSecurity ensues and is successfully passed. I begin to read through the notes on her account, and oh boy let me tell you, *War &amp; Peace* isn't even compared to how long and detailed the notes were.That the customer was an ***extremely*** vulnerable customer was mentioned on every single one. I shit you not. It turns out that the customer had fallen for a scam. Remote access scam. The \"Hello this is Win-Doors calling\" type of scam. They're based in India I have heard. Instead it wasn't Win-Doors this time. It was \"[bank]\". It was not us. They had convinced our customer to give access to her computer, and then had registered a number on the account. That was one scam.\n\nThe last few notes were informing colleagues that colleagues from a branch site will be on their way to make a home visit. Home visits by the way, are highly difficult. The area the customer lives in, the condition of the customer, the safety of staff have to all be considered and even if there is nothing of concern, the visit *must* be signed off by upper-upper(?) management. The people that I will never see, ever, but rely on FLC to direct them on them on these kinds of situs by way of the chain-in-command. This will be important later. \n\n&gt; **ME**: I'm very sorry that you are unable to order your medication. It looks like there is a home visit being arranged so that our staff can help you with your banking. I do apologise, but they should arrive hopefully mid next week (as it was a Friday). How much medicine do you have left?\n\n&gt; **VKL**: Oh, they're very welcome (she said in that sweet voice only old grandmas have). I have enough to last me until Thursday. I wasn't told about the visit, though. I have nobody here, so it'll be nice to speak to someone.\n\nMy heart fucking ~~broke~~ shattered. I already knew that care for the elderly in my country is a fucking shame, but it always kills me to hear of the loneliness first hand. I empathetically closed the call and informed my manager. I then emailed the people who left the last two notes on the account about a Home visit. And CC'd in their manager. And their manager's manager. I informed that that the customer was not aware of any visit and to update the case (which only they had access to. Above my pay. Strange considering I usually have access to everything to do with customers. Must be more vulnerable than I thought).\n\n---\nFast forward to the following week, and I sign in to find a plethora of emails w/r/t the email I had sent. One of the emails (sent by one of the manager's manager in the email), was detailed and informed me that I had now access to the case and that I needed to email the lead investigator. \n\nI forwarded this to my manager who in turn advised that I should ring the branch and get them kickstarted on the visit. It was not right to keep the customer waiting. Emailing the investigator could come later. So off I went. I first read the case. There was a comment left on there, **two whole fucking days** before I took the call from `VKL` and was left by `RD` stating that he will ring the branch to arrange the visit. So with that in mind I proceed to ring the branch.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Hi SM. It's Peace [from this location]. I have a customer who was promised a visit by you guys. Just rang to see how that's getting on. Here are her details. \n\n&gt; **SM**: Thanks for that, Peace. [Silence as he checks the records]. Ummm, sorry to say this Peace but we weren't informed of a visit request. Nobody called us.\n\nI began to fume. Total shit-show of competency. `RD` was a slacker. It takes two minutes to call. Piece of total shit!\n\n&gt; **ME**: I'm sorry to hear that too `SM`, but is there anyway you can fast track the procedure? I am beginning to worry. `VKL`said that she was trying to order her medication and only has enough until Thursday. This is our customer's life we're talking about. I don't mean to be respectful, but `VKL` really needs our help and support.\n\n&gt; **SM**: Of course. Not to worry. It isn't your fault really. We should have been notified before today. I will have to get my Regional Manager (we're talking about the Big Dogs here) to sign off on it. I'll definitely give her a call right now, and ensure that this is signed off as quickly as it can be whilst keeping in line with protocol. If you give me your email, I'd be more than happy to keep up to date on `VKL` if you'd like?\n\nAt last, I thought. Someone was going to make sure `VKL`was being looked after. Especially in terms of finance. I prayed that `SM` would actually come through. The emails between me and `SM` continued. He had managed to get approval of a visit. It also turned out that my call with `VKL` was listened to by not QA but QA for vulnerable callers. They were highly and thoroughly impressed according to `SM`. Funny what happens when you actually do your job right. It turned out that `VKL` had been scammed into thinking that vitamin tablets were important to her health. \n\n`SM` and his team continued to educate the customer and help look after her banking. What not to do, don't disclose PINs, card numbers in full etc etc. The vulnerable team had also paid a visit and started to help `VKL` on how to bank safely. After requesting a conversation with social care, it turns out that `VKL` had social support workers twice a week, but `SM` and his colleagues managed to push for four. This enraged my hatred for `RD` even more. How you don't do something after specifically writing that you would, is beyond me. He could've rang immediately after. It was only 12:30 when he had finished the note. Dick! \n\nThe scammers had managed to register their number as the requested number to call. Yeah, I deleted that. Fuck 'em. I have been informed that upper-higher management (again, like Top Dogs) had heard about my call with `VKL` and how I had handled it. \n\nI informed my Manager that I didn't want recognition. I was more happy that finally, after the total and utter incompetence shown my middle management wannabes, `VKL` was looked after. Y'know, people who have been with the company longer, are on the next pay grade above, but still don't know how to do their damn job. \n\nI know that we all have customers that come through and piss us off. They want everything for nothing, they don't want to do security, they want to speak to a manager as soon as they come through, but to see a colleague become utterly complacent is somehow even fucking worse. Fuck those guys. \n\n---\nTLDR: More senior colleagues prove that the Peter Principle is alive and well in my workplace. \n\nEDIT: grammar. \n\nEDIT 2: typo fix.",

        "text": "Background:  I work in the call center for an insurance industry giant.  Strike one for me, it's insurance.  Nobody wants to work in insurance.  Over the year or so that I've worked there I've taken almost every possible opportunity to get off the phones, from crosstraining on new skills to becoming a certified trainer on a few different skills.  Over the past couple of months, I thought I saw my way out!  We have strict commitments to work 18 months within the call center before we could do anything else within the company, but I found a couple of roles that I was decently qualified for that would have no to minimal phone time.\n\nThe first position was an assistant manager job supporting our hiring team.  Interviewed fairly well, could have gone better, didn't get the job.  I expected this because I knew they had been grooming somebody for that position for months, it was one of those \"we're posting because we're legally obligated to\" gigs.  Whatever.\n\nThe next position was what really pissed me off.  It was a job analyzing other reps' calls, scoring them, and recommending measures for improvement.  I hit the interview out of the damn park.  No job offer, no second round of interviews, because \"your personality is too big for the role, you would get bored\".  Bitch nah, I know full well what I applied for.  Keep in mind that previously I was told I was underqualified for the job level immediately above this one but someone overqualified for this. \n\nI have one foot out the door at this point and I know I'm not accepting an offer to do anything else for this company again. Basically just waiting on some outstanding job applications.  But a posting comes across the board for a job one grade above mine that my management team has been pushing me towards, so I figured at the very least the interview will get me some time off the phone.\n\nCome a couple of days before the interview, I get the meeting invite with some information, including a scenario that I'm supposed to solve as \"pre-work\", which specifically states that I am to use in between call time or ask to have a time slot opened up.  My department has been hit particularly hard recently, so I ask my manager who denied the request, and then I had the next day off.  Whatever, I didn't really want the job, wasn't too worried.  I interview, it goes obviously wrong, and I figured that's that.  \n\nCome today, I get a request to come in for interview feedback where I'm berated for not having taken the prework home because a \"real leader would have broken the rule and shown initiative\".  Our company specifically forbids hourly employees from bringing any work home.  Next, I'm told that I provided a bad example in which I helped a fellow representative with a quick hit issue on our mentor chat while on the line with a caller.  \"We have a procedure specifically for this, you can't break that rule.\"  So I ask the reviewing manager: \"I thought leaders have to show initiative?\" and by gosh have I never seen someone from this company look so pissed at me.  We concluded our interview with a \"You just didn't seem too invested in this role\" and \"I appreciate your input\" and that was that, but holy shit, really?  \n\nFuck pedantic, arbitrary \"leadership qualities\" and FUCK power-mad call center middle management.",

        "text": "I’ve worked in a call center for over a year, but I’ve always been dedicated (took calls for a single client) and the two I’ve been on were pretty basic. My team from the last client and I have been sent to shared where we represent about nine different clients, one of which involves low-level troubleshooting, and thus have to learn as many different systems and rules for each. Tomorrow will be my fourth day of taking shared calls. It’s difficult for everyone at first, especially those who have never been on shared before, and I’ve become somewhat more confident since I started. Still, I feel less sure of myself when I get calls that don’t go well and I’ve always been easily rattled by angry/annoyed people, which tends to make me forget what I learned when I’m new at it (which of course makes them angrier).\n\nOn the troubleshooting client, whose calls we have gotten fewer of so far, I had to take a message for this customer because of an issue she had with her product so that customer service could get back to her (I am on the basic support team) and needed a certain identification number to do this. \n\nLady: I can’t find it. Can’t you just look up my account?\n\nMe: We don’t have access to your account information, but I’ll get a picture of what it looks like \\*searches through system, which is slow\\*\n\nL: \\*getting impatient\\* Oh my God. Can you transfer me to customer service so they can help me?\n\nAt this point I was getting more nervous than I was already and upset that this customer was irritated, and forgot how to transfer even though I’d done it once before on shared – we never transferred on dedicated.\n\nL: Transfer me to customer service right now!\n\nI had to put her on hold while panicking and searching for transfer instructions, and while I was doing that she hung up. \n\nI spent a while feeling bad about screwing up that call, and feeling stupid and incompetent. I keep reminding myself I’ve never done shared before or any client that was more complicated, everyone who is just starting is stressed about it, this is a new system and new set of rules, my brain freezes when I’m very nervous and this happens more often with angry customers, and this customer might not have been as annoyed if she had known all this. If she would have felt the same way, well, that’s her personality.\n\nSome people might suggest getting a new job, but interacting with customers happens in some way in almost every job and it’s important to be sure of yourself and not be easily intimidated. I’m trying to get one that has less of it than this does, although without a particular set of many “hard” skills, I’m probably limited for the moment to customer service-related positions.\n\nI go in early sometimes to review, and review between calls, and took home my binder to look at it. I also write myself encouraging notes to stick in the binder. But I thought it would be helpful to have advice from more experienced agents.\n\nThank you for reading. Anything you can suggest, I would appreciate!\n\nTL;DR- I’m new to shared. It’s stressing me out.",

        "text": "I used to work in credit card activations and I also sold the banks credit card insurance to clients who've called in. I've posted before about some of my more, lets say interesting calls but I consider this one to be the most memorable call I ever did. This is going to be the one that sticks with me years to come. This story took place on Easter Sunday, I promise that will be relavent in a bit. \n\nSo client calls in and I get her information and ask her the security questions, all basic stuff and its over with easily. I'm about to transition into the sales pitch for the insurance plan, but before that I take a couple minutes to build rapport. Contrary to the popular opinion around these parts I actually really like building rapport, I like to make jokes on the phone and sometimes I get someone who jokes back and we have a little bit of fun. This was one such occasion\n\nMe: Thanks for calling (bank name) I hope you have an eggcellent Easter!\n\nClient: Thanks! you have a *hoppy* one yourself. Hope your not spending the whole day at work that would suck.\n\nMe: Haha don't worry I'm not going to let my family hog all the chocolate to themselves.\n\nFrom here I transition into the sales pitch. She listens quietly and waits for me to finish. When I get to the end and ask for the sale, she said this:\n\nClient: Wow! That sounds like a great plan. I wish I knew about it before I got cancer.\n\nI've never felt so deflated in my life. Not just because I definitely wasn't going to get the sale but I actually really liked this woman and she was actually really young, in her early twenties. Anyway I didn't want to be the asshole who tried to sell her insurance she can't use so I wished her the best and closed the call. Its been months and I still think about her from time to time, I really hope she's OK.",

I had another bottle where the lotion turned all brown and thick. I want to make sure this bottle is ok to give away without opening it.\n\nMe: well, what's the expiration dates on the bottles?\n\nC: They don't have expiration dates.\n\nMe: Yes, they do, they're printed on the crimp on the bottom of the bottle.\n\nC: I see some numbers on the bottom, 022015.\n\nMe: That means it expired February of 2015. (Note: it was over two years later at this point.)\n\nC: Well, I already gave away the other bottle to be part of a charity raffle, do you think it's ok?\n\n---------------\n\nConsultant: So my customer's son ate a whole bottle of the intensive renewing serum capsules, do you think he'll be ok?\n\nMe: CALL POISON CONTROL, WHY ARE YOU EVEN ASKING.\n\nConsultant: Are you sure?\n\nMe: Yes, please call now.\n\nConsultant: Alright, if you insist.\n\n---------------\n\nCustomer: So I'm thinking of becoming a consultant, but first, I need to purchase one of every product your company has ever produced. I have (lists half the catalogue), what am I missing, and how much would it be?\n\n(I spend 45 minutes listing every product she doesn't have, including the prices, and tabulating it. I have to explain several things over and over.)\n\nCustomer: Ok, that's all the products you have currently, but what about everything that's been discontinued? What are all of those, and how much would those be?\n\nMe: Those products are discontinued. We don't have them anymore. I don't have information about them.\n\nCustomer: But I need one of EVERYTHING. Where can I get them?\n\nMe: I don't know, try eBay?\n\n(She called back 6 times asking the same thing, I ended up getting her again, the whole entire conversation got repeated. She kept calling in more asking the same thing. I ended up writing down her account number so I could read the notes to track her being crazy.)\n\n---------------\n\nAnd lastly, this wasn't me, this was a coworker.\n\nCaller: So I tried to use one of the products as lubricant and I broke out in hives *down there*, what should I do?\n\nAgent: We don't sell lubricant, which product where you using?\n\nCaller: the acne treatment sulfur wash.",

        "text": "Good morning. I work at a call center in North Carolina. We generally answer calls, Research the order that has been placed, And we resolve issues that come through. Typically, most calls are status checks. \n\n\"Hey, I'm looking for PO # XXXXXXXX, Could you look it up for me?\" Stuff like this. No big deal.\n\nNow we get bad calls, of course. Everyone that works call centers gets bad calls. I'm sure a few of you reading this have stories at the ready to tell everyone about a shitty caller who made your day terrible.\n\nBUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT THOSE JACKASSES.\n\nThis is about a lady that called yesterday, looking to get a credit on returned product. Okay, That's what I do. I'm Me. The Customer was named Kammie. Her actual name. Love her &lt;3. But the name is important for the story. A little backstory on me. I just got steam after years of not having a computer good enough to play any game other than maybe undertale and some other retro 8-bit games. I got a new computer a few months ago, and I've been playing Fallout 4 in my free time. I like video games. Always have. So. Enter conversation with Kammie.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling CompanyIWorkAt, This is SleeperNick, How can I help you?\n\nKammie: Hello! I would like to get a Credit for PO XXXXXXXX.\n\nMe: Certainly! Give me one moment to put this in for you! \n\n(These Credits usually take a few moments to put in and sometimes it can be awkward and silent on the phone. Not with me, I'm the master of talking when nobody else wants to)\n\nMe: So, Is Kammie short for Camille? \n\n(Me trying to segway this conversation into a League chat, Or atleast see if some other random people in the world play League of legends)\n\nKammie: No. It's just Kammie! That's what's on my birth certificate!\n\nMe: Oh Cool! Like the girl from Street Fighter?\n\nKammie: Yeah! Everyone always says that.\n\nMe: I'm sure. Nerds and Video game culture are blooming Massively in this day\n\nKammie: Yeah. Me and my husband are in our 50s and we just started playing Fallout 4!\n\n(No. Fucking. Way)\n\nMe: ME TOO! \n\n(Cue us rambling about everything we've learned about Fallout 4, And tips we've learned and building tips and where to get some hidden weapons that are pretty strong, etc)\n\nThe call ended up taking about 15 minutes. 3 of which was done working and 12 of which was spent legitimately enjoying talking to a customer. It's customers like Kammie who make the job worth doing. \n\nI hope everyone here has a Kammie of their own, And I hope you guys all have a Great day! ",

        "text": "Thought I'd just share some of the crazy shit that will happen. I've got a couple calls about people doing crazy shit/being stupid all around.\n\n**First call:**\n\nGuy calls in and tells me that he ran off the side of the road and that he needs help. I immediately notice he's calling in on an anonymous number, which means I'm gonna have to ask for his phone number verbally.\n\nMe: What's your policy number?\n\nHim: I don't have that.\n\nMe: Phone number that could be listed on your policy?\n\nHim: \\*Gives me a number\n\nMe: Any other numbers?\n\nThis guy is seemingly completely absent from our records/system. I'm already thinking that maybe he has a different insurance company (you'd be amazed how many people will call us, even though they canceled their policy years ago). I try to search his policy through his name, zip code, etc. He gives me a name and there is a policy with that name and I ask for a DOB and he gives me like a DOB that would make him in his 50s. Make no mistake, this guy is VERY OBVIOUSLY a kid who can't possibly be an adult. I try to get his driver license number and he tells me he doesn't have that and that he has a learner permit. Finally, I go and ask for a social security number and he gives me a ten digit number...like what the fuck. I repeat it back like 5 different times and then tell him it's 10 digits and he just goes \"Yeah, that's right.\" Then I'm sitting there going, \"Sir, a SSN is not 10 digits in any circumstance.\" I still can't find his policy number and he starts going on about how he ran off the side of the road and he's still in his car and it flipped upside down. Great, now this is claims because his vehicle flipped. He asks me if he should leave the vehicle and I tell him that I would think he should get himself out. He then immediately tells me, \"Ok, I did that.\" And I go, \"That quickly?\" And he responds with, \"Yeah.\" Anyway, I try for like 5-10 more minutes to get his policy and I just can't find it. During this time, I found a policy with \"his\" first and last name in a different location and ask for a DOB and he gives me a new DOB... I don't like passing the buck, but I go ahead and transfer him to our claims department since he needs to speak with them anyway and I can't find his shit. I tell the claims agent at this point that I'm pretty convinced it's a prank call. I stay on the line for a moment and listen in and they ask him again for a DOB and he tells them ANOTHER different DOB than the two he already gave me.\n\nBut it doesn't end here.\n\nI have a pretty fucking amazing memory and call very clearly recall specific details about past events. I get a call the next day and notice it's anonymous and this person put in the same number that I remembered yesterday. After doing my intro, it's the same guy calling back in.\n\nMe: Can I get your PN?\n\nHim: Sure, but I'm locked in my car right now, do you think I should stay in it?  \nMe: Uh, you're just locked in it. Like you can't open it?\n\nHim: Yeah, should I break the window?  \nMe: Sure if you feel the need to, I guess.\n\nAfter playing this rodeo with him for like 5 minutes of trying to find his fake policy, I get my supervisor over. I had already told her yesterday I was pretty convinced it was a prank call and she brushed it off as maybe the guy was just nervous/not thinking clearly since he was involved in an accident. This time, though, she is on board with me and gets on the line and sorts this kid out.\n\n**Second call:**\n\nA guy calls in and has a real policy and everything, but oddly enough it shows that he has been getting an incompleted tow set up every day for like the past month or month and a half and that all of the claims show they were never able to verify location. This is another prank caller who would just waste your time and wait until you get to the part where you're going to verify his location and he goes \"Oh, nevermind I got Triple A coming out, I don't need you guys\" and hangs up. He had been doing this every day for months now and on every other claim, it's always listed as an unknown/incomplete location.\n\n**Third call:**\n\nMe: Intro, I'll have someone right out to you and I just have a few questions here (I usually pause after that and give them a moment to say something to make sure they are there).\n\nHim: HURRY UP AND ASK THESE FUCKING GOD DAMNED QUESTIONS SO I CAN GET OFF THIS PHONE!  \n\n\nHe basically screams every response he gives to me and the part that made this guy lose his shit even more than before was when I asked for the color of the vehicle.\n\nHim: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU NEED THE FUCKING COLOR OF MY CAR FOR, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, 20 FUCKING QUESTIONS OR SOME BULL SHIT?\n\nMe: (At this point, I've about had it with this dude's shit so I give him a pretty dick response) Yeah, well, you see, there's just more than one Ford truck out there in the world and we want to let the tow company know which ford truck they should be looking for.\n\nI finally find someone to come out and change this dick's tire.\n\nMe: Do you have any further questions for me?\n\nHim: NO, HANG UP THE FUCKING LINE NOW.\n\nMe: Ok, thank you-\n\nHim: WHY ARE YOU STILL FUCKING TALKING? I SAID HANG UP YOU FUCKING IDIOT.\n\n**Fourth call:**\n\nI get to the point in our system where I'm about to let him know if he has the coverage or not. That's when I see a policy cancelation notice. I break the news to him.\n\nMe: Yes, I always see here this is a canceled policy.\n\nHim: A canceled policy?\n\nMe: Yes, it has been non-renewed.\n\nHim: Bla bla bla, you guys always renew it, etc. So you're saying that I don't have insurance and haven't had insurance for two months now?\n\nMe: Basically, yeah.\n\nHim: (Starts arguing with me)\n\nMe: Yeah, I understand your concerns, but I don't really know all the information here. If you want to inquire about this, then you need to speak with CS and ask them about this. \n\nI'm amazed at how many times I take calls from people who call the wrong insurance company or don't even know that they no longer have a policy with us. I've had people who canceled their policy years ago call in without even realizing they don't insure with us anymore. People call in who got canceled like 3 months ago and are surprised to hear they've been driving w/o insurance for 3 months now. Like for real? I feel like a cancelation notice for my insurance would be something that should be pretty fucking hard to miss.\n\nCrazy people man.",

I just needed to rant about this particular asshole I had to deal with tonight:\n\nI never did find out what he wanted, other than to talk to a supervisor. He wouldn't tell me his name, and started the call by repeatedly calling me a \"scumbag\". I explained I could gladly get him a supervisor if he would tell me his name, to which he replied \"Ronald Reagan\"... I said \"I'm sorry Mr. Reagan, but it appears you'r not authorized on this account, can I get your mobile number?\" He didn't think that was very funny... I finally had to tell him if he wanted to keep trying to insult me, I would have to end the call, to which he stated he didn't want to talk to \"a trained monkey like you\". Mr Reagan was a real charmer, let me tell you! I replied \"That's great sir, I'm going to have to end this call now, but I'll have my supervisor call you back at her earliest convenience\" and then I stayed on the line just long enough to hear him shout \"WAIT WAIT WAAAAAIIIIIITTTTT!!!!\" before I hung up. It's so rare that I actually get to hang up on someone within the confines of our company policy, that I took some small satisfaction from it :)\n\nMy supervisor did call him back around 30 minutes later, and apparently he just acted like an ass to her too... she told him he was clearly very tired and she would call him back tomorrow when he was feeling better and hung up on him as well... She never found out what he was so upset about either lol",

        "text": "I work at an alarm monitoring company. We’re not the actual alarm company, so we don’t handle billing, tech support, basically anything that doesn’t have to do with an alarm going off. We dispatch local authorities or disregard your alarms and not much else. \n\nFor some reason or another, when people get their alarm systems, they don’t tell the people who they put as their emergency contacts that they’ve done such. So it’s not uncommon for people to think we’re calling to sell alarms (we’re not) or that it’s a scam to get personal information. (It’s not). PLEASE!!! If you are getting an alarm system, tell the people who you are making contacts!!! \n\nOn with the story. \n\nI receive a residential fire alarm. The usual procedures for this is to call the site first, if no contact, you dispatch fire department, then call emergency contacts to see if they are able to meet authorities there. It’s Sunday, and the alarm is from the Bible Belt. I wasn’t able to make contact on site so the fire department was dispatched and I am now calling the contact listed as a neighbor. I’ll be Me, she’ll be Jesus Lady or JL for short. \n\nMe: Hi, this is beegealous with (alarm company). I’m calling in regards to —\n\nJL: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU’RE CALLING ON A SUNDAY? THE LORD’S DAY? WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESTING! DON’T YOU HAVE JESUS IN YOUR HEART?! \n\nI’m stunned, but it’s my second to last day, and as I’ve reached peak “fuck it,” this is actually pretty funny to me. I had to mute the phone to laugh. \n\nMe: I’m sorry, I’m calling in regards to an alarm from —\n\nJL: I DON’T CARE WHY YOU’RE CALLING, I AM NOT INTERESTED! \n\nSo she thinks I’m selling something. I get this a lot. Usually I ask if they know the subscriber. Sometimes I get a “yes,” sometimes a pause and they say “no.” I know you know the person if you pause. Just tell the truth! \n\nMe: I’m calling regarding (subscriber’s name), do you know them? \n \nJL: Oh my god, yes, that’s my elderly neighbor! \n\nMe: We received a fire alarm from their residence, we have dispatched the fire department and we are calling to see if you are available to meet them? \n\nHer tone changed so fast it was almost whiplash! Sputters and apologizing to me, over and over again.  There ended up being no emergency but I seriously hope she never answers the phone like that to someone again! \n\nTL;DR: religious woman thinks I’m trying to sell her something when her elderly neighbor is potentially having an emergency. \n\nOn mobile. \n",

        "text": "TL;DR: Lady asks to verify name though it’s common sense, lady threatens litigation, lady won’t take coworker’s suggestion because she doesn’t want to lie yet has no better option \n\nI had two interesting calls today\n\n1) I won’t use my real name for this but just know that it’s a name where the first letter is unmistakable, like Billy, you know starts with a “B” or Larry, you know starts with an “L,” and so I answer the call with the usual corny greeting with my name and the caller says “Diana with a “D”?” (Diana’s not my name) and I had to pause to give my mouth time to catch up with my brain cause I couldn’t believe someone just asked that. \nThe last part of my name is spelled with either one or two e’s, so I usually let them know there are two e’s when they ask for my name for their notes, but she seemed like the type that would check for bananas in the meat section at the grocery store. \n\n2) I had the longest call I’ve ever had doing a claim for nearly two hours. \nI take property claims and again I’ll try not to get into too much detail but the caller just kept talking about how the company couldn’t cancel her policy (she’d received a termination letter) and that she would sue for millions if the claim was denied. \nShe acknowledged that this had nothing to do with me but just rambled on about how the company had insured someone else who shouldn’t have been insured and went on and on about the current legal proceedings. \nI didn’t need even 1/100th of the information she shared but to appease her I listened and told her how frustrating it all must have been. She wasn’t a nasty or rude person at all and I understood why she wanted everything documented correctly, but she had my list over 40 items that were part of the claim instead of just saving the extensive list for the adjuster and categorising things for me to briefly list on the claim (jewellery, furniture, firearms, rather than list each piece of jewellery, each furniture item, each firearm, etc.). \nI just have no idea why she threw out litigation as if I was supposed to start shaking in my boots. I’m sure the company’s been sued before and she won’t be the last person if she does move forward with that.  \n\n3) My coworker got a call from a lady who couldn’t give an exact date for the claim (when the home was damaged) and when my coworker suggested an estimated date (based on the lady saying it happened in spring) the lady said she “didn’t want to lie,” so I’m not exactly sure what she expected if she didn’t have a date and wouldn’t take a suggested date. My coworker talked to her for 30 minutes and she asked if my coworker’s dad was still alive; she said no, he’d passed two years ago, and apparently the caller wanted to keep discussing this for some reason. My coworker spent half an hour on the phone with her and she didn’t even file a claim. \n\nI’m just doing this as a second job til I can catch up financially and then I’ll quit faster than a New York minute. \nThe environment isn’t terrible but they’re kind of annoying with rules. \nA team lead saw me drinking (a smoothie) as I was walking to the exit, and he told me I shouldn’t be walking and drinking (which I get, it’s carpeted so if it spills, but really? That’s why they pay for maintenance), and you can’t wear hoods on your head (my blouse once had a hood that I put on the lower back half of my head and my team supervisor took it off while I was at my desk which I found kind of rude).\nIt’s funny because my main job is a “professional” position and it’s much more relaxed there. \n\nHoping this will be my last call centre.

        "text": "Alright, so this one's a bit of a throwback, because I haven't worked at my old call center job for about three years now, but back when I was I was reading a book one day (like I did every shift), and you technically weren't supposed to but the supervisors didn't care, and neither did anybody else except for the owner, and I probably should've waited until he'd gone home before crackin' that baby open, but he comes in, and he sees me, and he says \"YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE READING\". Okay, whatever, I put it away, like I always do when I get caught (because they never do anything about it), and I figure I'll just wait until he leaves to start back up again, but then about a minute later he comes back to make a speech about how important it is for productivity not to be distracted, and while he's saying that he sees one kid in the corner on his smartphone, and he says \"Are you on your smartphone!?\", and the kid says \"YEAH, I'M ON TWO, WHO GIVES A FUCK, I'M THE MOST PRODUCTIVE PERSON HERE\" and then the two of them go out back and you can hear them yelling at each other off in the other room for about TEN MINUTES, and he comes back in and says \"I GUESS I'M QUITTING BECAUSE THE BOSS MAN IS TOO DUMB TO KNOW REAL TALENT WHEN HE SEES IT\" and storms off. The owner comes back in, looks at the supervisor, and is all like \"What's THAT guy's problem?\", and I shit you not the supervisor stands up, throws the keys at the guy and says \"YOU CAN TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT\" and then HE storms out as well. I think the two of them probably expected me to walk out with them, but of course I don't, because it's an easy job with flexible hours where I can read the whole time as long as the boss isn't around, and the rest of the shift is the boss sitting at the supervisor's desk, clearly oblivious to how fucking out of touch with the rest of the office he is. The next day I come in for morning shift and he tries to get me to make the coffee, which is the supervisor's job, and I say \"I don't drink coffee, sorry\" and the guy has to make the pot himself, which I immediately grab a cup of, and as I sip that coffee I just stare him down with the biggest grin I can muster because I know there's no friggin' way he can say anything to me knowing two people just quit in the middle of a survey lol. And the best part was that a new supervisor ended up getting hired who realized our pay was below average and ended up getting everybody raises, so you could say I really boosted morale by reading on the job",

I work for a small call centre and a lot of what I do is phone political polling, but we also accept surveys from other clients, and we’re doing one now. I can’t go into any specific details, but it’s to do with tourism in a certain part of the country, and we’re calling people all across the country. The other salient point for this particular story is that we’re not always told the sponsor of our surveys, and when we are told, we can’t disclose it to callers until the end of the survey to avoid bias in the results (and most participants don’t ask). The following conversation transpired today (respondent will be ABB, for angry baby boomer):\n\nMe: [asks survey question] \n\nABB: before we go on, can I ask why you’re doing this research? \n\nMe: [canned response about hearing peoples’ opinions, etc]\n\nABB: could you please tell me who is sponsoring this survey?\n\nMe: I’m really sorry, but I’m not able to disclose that information at this time. I can tell you at the end of the survey. \n\nABB: how do I know you’re going to do that? I’d prefer to know now. \n\nMe: well, I promise that I’ll do it at the end, but it’s our policy to not reveal sponsors during surveys to avoid bias in the results. Perhaps if you’d like to continue the survey - \n\nABB: that’s not fair! I asked nicely. I’m offended that you won’t tell me. \n\nMe: I’m really sorry, but I can only tell you at the end. \n\nABB: then I’m not interested in participating. [Huffs, then hangs up the phone] \n\nI mean, if that lady wants to pay my living expenses during the unpaid internship that this job is currently supporting, then sure, I’ll blow up all the rules and get fired. But I doubt that. Other things that have transpired during this shift:\n\n- general racism towards indigenous people and immigrants\n\n- someone who said that they would only do the survey if we paid them $55 an hour (which like, fair enough, but we don’t pay, there are online focus groups for that) \n\n- someone who complained about my calling her WHILE SHE WAS IN THE BATH. Lady, I have but your phone number and a rough idea of your geographical location, I don’t know what you’re doing. Maybe next time you’re having a soak, consider just letting calls go to voicemail?
