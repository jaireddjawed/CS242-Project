        "text": " Curious to ask him any religious monotheistic believer/practitioner: why are evolution and creation binary? Why the dichotomy? Do some believe in evolution as a process created by God? If natural selection is theoretically true, for example, how is this not justified in religion as part of the world that God created? Why is it instead considered at odds with the belief of a God-created universe? Why does religious doctrine, that the world was created as is, decidedly reject the idea that evolution could be part of that very world, IMO they do not need to be mutually exclusive. How is every other part of the story of creation acceptable, but the concept of evolution is preposterous? I imagine there are varying perceptions of God‚Äôs role in nature.\n\nI‚Äôm not trying to be flippant, but here‚Äôs a metaphor to better explain my thought process and how I got to this question. When you are baking a cake, you don‚Äôt construct a cake in it‚Äôs final form, you mix the basic ingredients and with heat it becomes a cake over time through chemical reactions and physical properties‚Äîthere are so many different types of cakes that share common ingredients. Although we expect consistent results when replicating a cake recipe, once in a while it may come out different for many reasons (oven too cool üòé , too much liquid, forgot the baking powder, eyeballing measurements, wrong size pan, etc.). The result could be an abomination, or it could be a new type of cake altogether ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But we still say you made the cake, even though you actually made the batter, which later became a cake.\n\nContext: I am agnostic, and never studied religion; but I have some religious friends and I am most respectfully curious. I‚Äôm not trying to debate, or invalidate any beliefs, just looking for answers yo.\n\nPeace",

Isn't he everywhere? There is a world, there is a valley, there is a forest and it has been like this for centuries?But God is everything, and there is not everything, because God is also nothing. After all, the world is God, and God is the world, because the world is not dead, but also not alive. And smog descends from the heavens like an unfulfilled punishment, like the darkness of the night or the sea. Like a burnt forest from which the animals are running in a crowd. After all, God is a sin, after all, God is a mortal sin himself, making a hearse for himself. After all, God is also people, there are their goodness and vices, not alive, but also not dead. Why, then, did a copper man appear from the depths and wilds of the earth, eating a zepelin? Why did Led come down on a white stallion and Dom on a red one? Why did the Dom stay on the ground and wait, and the Led rushed forward on a horse, one stumbled on the run, falling, and his bones became oil, and meat became food for us, ravens and people, the same ravens, the other petrified sitting on the spot exactly, and became a mountain, like Buddha, whose as the same as Yahweh, the face of God appeared on the rock, the face of Dom. What for? Everything is so, because God does not know how, as long as he is blind and deaf and dumb as a man, that there is no garden of Eden in the world, that parents are dead and sons are dying, that the world of God, like uninhabited, also does not have an earthly root, in the likeness of which elephants catch the fruits of initiation. He took a stake, even though he was dying like that, and he was weak as a man, and there was still strength in his heart, he took a stake, rusty, or oak, and pierced himself with it. Having influenced his death by his own power, he took his strength and threw it, as gray people throw stones into the water, who beat trees with axes and, and leaves with sickles, then with reapers. And his blood spilled in the world ocean like black tar, and splattered across the sky with smog, because it was small, and God's will did not become his servant and found the damned, and the world went out, and the world sat down to beat red ties, and the steel and copper messiah became!",

I would like something more than \"God said its ok.\" The \"God said so\" argument is always the short answer on matters of religion- so lets get into the rational here. How is this ok? People have told me - He married women who needed help, he married pious women, he married for political reasons. Ok? So then why cant anyone marry over four women if those women need help, are pious or are needed for some political arrangement?",

        "text": "**Note: This could be a controversial post. I do not advocate discrimination of anyone, although the topic of discrimination will be discussed in the post. The following is my own scriptural interpretation. I do not speak for others.** \n\nIn Hindu scriptures, four groups are mentioned: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra.\n\n The system was  was originally there to accomplish the society needs and works among different group of peoples based on their skills. There needs to be different jobs for society to function. \n\nFor example, the Brahmins are/were the category of job including priests, scientists monks, teachers, doctors, engineers and philosophers.\n\nKshatriya are/were warriors (military), rulers, politicians and kings. \n\nVaishyas are/were very agricultural. Their jobs are mostly farming and trading. \n\nShudras are/were more manually orientated. Their jobs traditionally include things like tanning leather, cleaning, shoe making and other crafts. \n\nThere is a hymn in the Rig Veda (one of the important Hindu scriptures) metaphorically describing all of society as coming from a body. Brahmins come from the mouth, because their jobs traditionally involved a lot of talking and reciting prayers and chants, \n\nKshatriyas come from the arms, because their jobs traditionally involved being in the military (very physical) and wielding power. \n\nThe merchants, traders and farmers come from the legs (because they walk around in fields a lot and travel. \n\nShudras are the feet because without manual labour, especially in ancient times, society would stop.\n\n**This might be interpreted as showing that all humans depend on each other in one body. However, it has sometimes been used to justify unequal treatment or to deny the rights of the ‚Äòlower varnas‚Äô. However, I can't find anything in this hymn that says to discriminate against the people based on jobs. I don't believe this is justification to discriminate at all. I believe it means we should all work together as one society, treating each other equally. Everyone has a different role to play based on their skills and everyone's life is sacred.** \n\nIn ancient times, people often inherited and learnt a trade from their family. The trade would be passed down by ancestors. However, according to Srimad Bhagvatam (another scripture) if a person from one varna shows the skills and qualities required for another, he should be accepted into that varna. There are lots of verses like that. \n\nWhat do you think?",

I can't refute that, it's true. Just look at what the premises actually say though. That's been the actual fascinating part about this proof since I thought of it. \n\nIt can ONLY be valid if you are an atheist. It can NEVER be valid if you are theist.

        "text": "I recently listened to a [very fascinating interview between Jonathan Pageau (Orthodox) and Luke Burgis (Catholic)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fItOlHFQHbw). My favorite part begins at the 47th minutes - Society has fully accepted Christ's teaching to care for the victim. Society frowns upon exploitation of the weak and poor treatment of the downtrodden. [Tom Holland's book, Dominion](https://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Christian-Revolution-Remade-World/dp/0465093507), is a good account of how the Christian virtues came to dominate the entire globe. He recounts the radical ideas of Christ against the backdrop of the Ancient world and, specifically, Rome. That era was brutal and required strength to preserve internal order, protect a city / state from enemies, etc. Chris's love for the weak and forgotten totally shattered this way of life.\n\nLuke also outlines an observation from the French philosopher [Renee Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) that there is intense mimetic rivalry over who is the most victimized. This process is mimetic, meaning that we mimic others in claiming how much we are victims and we grant virtue to victims because others around us are doing it.\n\nThis theory is extended to the culture war. Luke and Jonathan argue the culture war is secular modernity tryin to be more Christian than Christ. Secular modernists believe they care for victims more / better than Christians. They care for victims though without honoring / believing in God. **There is an important instance in the Gospels, specifically the book of Luke Chapter 12, in which Judas behaves in the same way as the secular modernist.**\n\nI've been using a new reading app called [CommonPlace](https://apple.co/3Dnush0) to annotate and save my favorite bible verses. I've been posting my favorite verses and other Christian reading to the Catholicism book club and the verse below can found on the app too!\n\n&gt;*Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 2 Here a dinner was given in Jesus‚Äô honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. 3 Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus‚Äô feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, 5 ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year‚Äôs wages.‚Äù 6 He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. 7 ‚ÄúLeave her alone,‚Äù Jesus replied. ‚ÄúIt was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. 8 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.‚Äù*\n\nWe must prioritize worshipping God before caring for victims. We care for victims as brothers and sisters in Christ and we are called to do so repeatedly throughout the Bible. Strip away God and the Bible, and the justification to care for the disadvantaged loses reasoning / purpose. Society has reached a point in 2023 in which we still care for victims but don't worship God at a societal level.\n\nWhat does everyone else think regarding Modernity trying to be Christian than Christ in context of Luke 12: 1- 8?",

All I was left with was more self doubt and more pessimism increasing in my life. Both pushing my existentialist lifestyle towards a nihilistic one. To the point I came to try stuff like Optimistic Nihilism. I however know the importance of creating my personal meaningful things in life. So, at one point, I came to know about omnism.\n\nI'm kinda new into omnism. I still don't know if there is a proper way to do it. I were born with Hinduism. Didn't have a life of trust and religiousness though. Paganism intrigues me for its nature loving aspect that nature is sacred and has profound meaningfulness. Buddhism intrigues me because mindfulness is something I struggle with a lot, considering my mind can be a moody and dirty place. So right now, my omnism is starting with these 3 religions. I'll probably further proceed to Christianity and Islam. Once I get more knowledgeable of the 3. \n\nMy basic understanding of omnism is that it's about respecting all religion. That all religions have truths. In a different way. With different Gods but all of them have the intent of making a human better with living life. And to understand the perfection in the universe called God.",
