I built an infrared secret message as the very last puzzle to solve. This is where the riddle comes in. After she finds this thing she's going to have to take it to a dark place and look at it using her phone instead of her eyes. The infrared shows up in the camera and gives her the combination to a locked box. The riddle just needs to give her those two points of information, that both darkness and a camera are required. I was thinking something along the lines of a second eye that's always with you? But i'm drawing a blank. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

These include finding secrets, keeping secrets, splitting up, or betrayal. I would be very glad for any help with this, and will post the answer if we get it. The only hints we have are that it's common sense and it's something you would have read in a textbook.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who helped me.
