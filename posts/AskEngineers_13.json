I’ve been planning how to get around this and it goes something like this:\n\n1.\tObtain 3 to 6 small speakers that connect to WiFi and are preferably battery powered/chargeable.\n2.\tVisit their houses (3 total, all different directions from me) on a day some week before April.\n3.\tWhen they’re all out of the room, place 1-2 speakers around the house. Hard to notice spaces would be good, like on top of a cupboard or high shelf, or under some furniture. Hard to find, hard to reach. You get the idea.\n4.\tWhen April Fools’ Day *finally* arrives, I’ll connect to one of these devices at each house and have them play a sound. Something like bird sounds or door knocks, just to mess with them a little. With more time, I could raise it up to perhaps music.\n5.\tIf they find that speaker and call/text me about the prank, I’ll “concede” and say the jig is up, hope you guys thought it was funny.\n6.\tActivate the second speakers. Same deal, maybe with an even more annoying sound. Rinse and repeat.\n\nI’m here today in /r/AskEngineers to help me with these “devices”. I can’t think of any product that:\n1.\tIs cheap\n2.\tCan be remotely controlled from my own PC or phone while connected to a different network\n3.\tCan have sounds played on each speaker individually, not all at the same time\n4.\t\n\nI dont know which other subreddit would be appropriate to ask in, but this one seems like a good start. If you all know some way i can accomplish this, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’ll just be setting some little kitchen timers up around their house, and that’s not AS fun y’know.",

I’m trying to keep between 65-75F @ 75% humidity.  The smart fan turns on when temp hits 70F and increases in air velocity at 75F but I couldn’t stay under 80F so added a 10”x10”  “flap” at the top that opens when main fan runs high, and even more when the “emergency exhaust” fan kicks in pushing colder air *in* at the bottom level, if that makes sense? Lol. Of course the temp drops when 1 or both fans increase airspeed and flap opens, but I lose humidity as well.  Might anyone have any ideas on how to regulate the temp without losing as much humidity?  It works pretty well overall, just trying to fine tune / increase efficiency.  Thank you!",

        "text": "I have a 300w dehumidifier, and the poor guy have been in his box for a year now because i was not sure if i wanted to install it.\n\nI want to run it through the apartments ventilation, to dehumidify the incoming air when summer comes, since i live in a humid climate and have mold allergies.   \n\n\nBut I'm not sure if its plausible. How much moisture it will remove, compared to the cost and additional heat energy released into the apartment.   \nThe datasheet says it will remove 8  liters/24h  at  27 °C, 60% RH or 16 liters/24h  at  32 °C, 80% RH.  \n Air flow (nom.) aprox. m3/h 120, which is what i need for the apartment anyways, so that's fine.  \nI guess you can somehow make a function out of that and see what it will remove with air temperature around 10-15°C and a 80% RH. How do you do that? And how much does the RH % drop in the room after that? Calculating RH is easy with temperature change, but not the rest.  \n\n\nDatasheet: [https://medieserver.jemogfix.dk//fotoweb/dk/pdf/1140\\_9052422\\_003.pdf](https://medieserver.jemogfix.dk//fotoweb/dk/pdf/1140_9052422_003.pdf)",

Been at the company a little over a year, but in this position for about 8 months. \n\nOver a team email chain, there was an issue brought up of components not being located properly in our vehicle model, one of them was one I made. Our architecture group determines where to put these components, and is mech guys (me and lead eng) design the brackets, and insert them into their positions. It was pointed out that these brackets were not located according to the architecture location and wanted to know when this was approved. I replied all with a date and when it was located. Someone replied that that was a major issue and that there has been a major disconnect between our two groups. And I replied (replied all) back saying \"I was directed to do that by \\[lead engineer\\], but he should be able to expand on this when he returns\" \n\nI clearly just threw him under the bus. It honestly wasn't my intention to do so, I thought he had prior approval and that this was discussed with the group. I honestly have no idea what I was thinking saying that, and feel that I definitely overstepped and crossed a line. No one from another group said anything, but I'm really afraid when he gets back to work on monday, I will be fired. \n\nHonestly, it was probably a very simple mistake, a miscommunication on his part I did not catch. The anxiety I have been feeling is insane, to the point of nausea. I feel terrible. Has anyone been in a situation like this before?",

        "text": "Possibly a dumb question, but bear with me. \n\nAssume you have an open differential with an input of 3000 Nm, intuitively we know that the output on each output shaft (which is connected to the side gears) will be 1500 Nm, assuming of course that there is no road/tire limitation.\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around exactly where this \"split\" of the torque happens. \n\nSay the pinion gear has an input of 1000 Nm, and it has 10 teeth while the ring gear has 30 teeth (I know this is not an ideal ratio, just using the numbers for simplicity) - that's a 3:1 ratio so the ring gear is spinning with 3000 Nm. \n\nThe ring gear is fixed to the spider gears somehow (either the ring gear is bolted/welded to a spinning case which uses a cross-shaft to trap the spiders, or there are posts/cantilevers attached to the ring that pilot the spiders). So as the ring gear is spinning with 3000 Nm of torque, it's \"carrying\" two opposing spider gears with it.\n\nThese spider gears mesh with the side gears. And, assuming the vehicle is driving straight and there are no drastic differences in road mu between the tires, the spider gears are \"revolving\" about the center of the diff, but not \"spinning\" about their own axis. They're merely causing the side gears to rotate simultaneously. \n\nAnd then of course from there the side gears are affixed to output shafts or whatever, and we know the output torque on those shafts will be half the input, or 1500 Nm each in this case.\n\nWhere exactly does this torque get \"split,\" though? If the spider gears are fixed to the spinning ring/case, wouldn't they each be rotating with 3000 Nm, too, inputting 3000 Nm to each side gear? \n\nAlso it seems like size of the internal differential gears (spider / side gear) does not matter here, because the input torque is simply split in half for the output. And I've seen differentials with two spiders or four spiders, but again the torque split is the same. So neither size nor number of spider gears makes a difference in the torque split calculation. It's simply half.\n\nHow does this work from a totally analytical/physical perspective?",

This hinge connects an assembly that rotates about the metal shaft which goes through the worn holes. The shaft is normally locked and does not rotate together with the assembly. Pretty straight forward.\n\nThe wear was a result of gradual loosening of shaft locking plate which led to loose shaft and free play.\n\nSo, one of my coworkers suggests we repair using welding then drill through the filler material to make new holes. While I'm not exactly opposing it I'm not entirely comfortable coz I'm not sure of the strength of the filler material. Even though, normally, there wouldn't be any friction between shaft and holes, it is still subjected to bearing stress when the actuation is carried out.\n\nI've read about MIG welding with a backing plate as a common process for hole repairs. But I've not been able to find any info of real substance. If anybody here has experience in this I'd really appreciate your input.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR what's your opinion on using welding to repair worn pad eye holes?",
