        "text": "Another one from the truck stop for you.\n\nWe have 14 diesel pumps out back, in 7 islands of 2. Each island has an intercom so we can talk back and forth with the truckers. A trucker will hit their button outside which starts our inside box beeping and we'll communicate with them. For regulars, we usually just ask what pump they're using and turn it on. For people we don't recognize, we'll need to take some information like their company, truck number, and how they're paying. It's supposed to prevent drive-offs, but people could always lie. Anyway, I digress.\n\nA couple months ago I was working the morning shift. It was about 9 or 10 and the back lot was empty. A guy pulls in and beeps in on the intercom. I was gonna turn it on for him, so I say \"Hi, what pump?\" He responds in heavily accented (it sounded Russian-ish if I had to guess) English \"ABC Express, truck 23, paying credit.\" I say \"Okay, what pump?\" He says again, a little agitated this time, \"ABC Express, truck 23, paying credit!\"\n\n\"Ok. What pump?\" Once again, but pretty pissed off this time. \"ABC EXPRESS! TRUCK 23! PAYING CREDIT!\" I'm getting frustrated, so I lean in really close and say \"What! Pump! Are! You! Attempting! To! Use!\"\n\n\"OH! Uh...18.\" \n\nI turned around and looked into the office to see the assitant manager, who had heard the whole thing, with her head on the desk laughing her ass off.",

        "text": "I use to work at a carpet cleaning company (Stanley Steemer).  The worst customer I have ever had the pleasure of working for, I call him Lieutenant Dan.  Me and my partner pull up to the just like every other job.  We lay down our mat to wipe our feet, and put on our protective shoe coverings on to keep us from dragging dirt in and out of the place.  We ring the door bell, the door opens.\n\n  At first I don't see anybody, but then I looked down.  I see him, a no legged man with a beer in his hand.  \"Who the hell are you\", he says.  Um sir we are here to clean your carpets.  After a little bickering he finally lets us in.  Now the next thing we are suppose to ask him is can you show is around sir.  Only problem is I felt awkward as hell asking him because it was a multi-level house, and he is in a wheel chair.   I ask him anyway.  To my surprise he jumps out of his wheel chair mumbling the whole time.  He walked up the stairs on his hands and showed us the rooms that he wanted cleaned.  Everything was matching up to the order except one room.  The room was huge and over 300 sq/ft ,  company policy was that it had to be counted as 2 rooms.  He throws a hissy fit about that to, but that's understandable a lot of people don't know that. \n\n  He then wants to add two sofas which isn't a problem for us, it counts as commission add on.   So we get done with the walk through and he wants to know the price.  I think after the sofas he added on it came to $160 or something.  He starts calling us mother fuckers and we are robbing him and stuff.  He said the lady on the phone quoted him $62 dollars for everything.  I tried to explain to him that's impossible the minimum for us to do a job is $92.  He then proceeded to curse us out some more calling me a lair and then proceeded grab another beer.\n\n  Well I'm all about the customer service so I tell him I can have the manager pull the phone call and listen to it, if the lady on the phone really did quote him that price we would clean it for that price.  Our manager pulls the call, and as I suspected the person on the phone never quoted Mr. Dan the $62.  In fact my manager said he couldn't understand a word the guy was saying.  We tell Lieutenant the news, and he then curses us out some more, but eventually decides to lets us clean the rooms.  We then started running lines and vacuum hoses into the house.  Apparently, dude didn't like our lines and jumped out of the wheel chair once again onto the porch and starts moving lines. \n\n All of a sudden he stumbles and face plants into the porch.  He's not moving, and I freeze for and start yelling at him to see if he's okay.  He doesn't answer.  All I can think of is this mother fucker just died on me.  I'm getting ready to jump over the rail and grab him, and he miraculously jumps up tells me he's okay, jumps into his wheel chair and proceeds to get another beer.  He stays in the kitchen the rest of the time until we finished cleaning.\n\n  Surprisingly after we got the stuff he wanted done he became super nice started apologizing to us for everything and even added more stuff on at the end off the job which made us a little more money.  He even tipped us.  I don't know what changed in him , but my money is on he drank enough to hit that everyone's my best friend level.  All in all when Lieutenant Dan drinks enough he's a alright guy. \n\nEdited for some grammar and put in some line breaks to make it easier to read. ",

Or the ones that don't understand jokes and then complain.  Those people are never fun.",

        "text": "Sorry all, this uses a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, I hope it makes enough sense to everyone:\n\nThis Dilbert comic says it all: http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2007-11-16/\n\nThese people are so overly obsessed with security that they can't see the forest for the trees. They have established security policies that fly in the face of common sense. Just a sampling of the BS I have to suffer with because of these people:\n\nI am not able to see the calendar or adjust the clock on my computer, which is 16 minutes behind. That would go against their 'security' policy. I'm 16 minutes late for everything because my all my reminders come late!\n\nThey refused to change the clock because 'it's not their job to manage small details like each user's system time'.\n\nI decided to circumvent their stupid policy by going into the BIOS and changing it there. When they found out that I had done so (how?) I was called into a meeting with them where they asserted that I had 'illegally accessed the BIOS'.\n\nI told them they had better report this to VP of IT right away. The stupid jackasses took the bait and actually did. When we all met, I explained to the VP what had happened. He excused me from the room and said \"don't worry about this\".\n\nAs I walked away I could hear screaming from the office as he tore them a new asshole.\n\nAnd that's just one story.\n\nI needed Webmail access for traveling. After multiple arguments with the IT department which eventually ended in another ass-reaming from my VP, they begrudgingly gave me access.\n\nBut the lead idiot didn't want me to have access from just anywhere, you know the entire purpose of Webmail.\n\nRegardless of the fact that it uses a secure server, and that there are 3 encrypted logins to reach the final login screen, he proposed that I wouldn't just access the Webmail from any old untrusted connection.\n\nNo, every time I was to access the webmail, I would have to phone a special phone number and give him my current IP address so he could put it in the whitelist, a list of trusted IPs. Seriously.\n\nAnother ass-reaming from my VP and I can now access anywhere, but do you see why I am getting so frustrated? I feel like I'm dealing with a bunch of 10 year-olds.\n\nThanks for reading. I'm exhausted.\n\nI will come back in a bit to participate in the threads once I've regained my strength.",

        "text": "I suppose I'll start this off. I work at a truck stop and it seems like lots of weird stuff always happens. We're situated just off a freeway and right next door to another truck stop. The driveways are probably 50 feet apart.\n\nA few years ago, a truck pulls in and gets fuel. There's 2 guys in the truck, one who doesn't say anything and one who is speaking English in a thick Cuban accent. They're inside and I'm trying to run his company's fuel card. It keeps getting denied. Finally I call the company and find out they're not set up to fuel with us, they needed to be at the station next door. Mind you, even though the driveways are close to each other, there are logos and store names everywhere. There's no way you can't know where you're at.\n\nSo Cuban and Mute are at the counter and I tell them their card won't work. Cuban says \"What you mean, dis won' work? Dis TA, right?\" I say, \"No, sir. That's next door.\" Cuban gets this look of shock on his face and slowly turns to Mute. WHAP! He slaps him in the back of the head. \"UN-PHOCKING BELIEVEABLE, MANG! YOU TAKE US TO DE WRONG SPOT!\" Mute looks hurt and very confused. WHAP! Cuban hits him again. \"UN-PHOCKING BELIEVEABLE! HOW PHOCKING DUMB ARE YOU?!\"\n\nI'm trying really hard not to laugh. I could've watched this all night, but instead I interjected \"Sir, do you have another way to pay?\" He ended up putting it on his personal credit card and the two guys left. I watched them walk back to the truck, Mute getting walloped another 3 or 4 times on the way.\n\nTL;DR: Cuban guy fills up at the wrong gas station, beats his co-driver in retaliation. ",
