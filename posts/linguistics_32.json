I watched a TV program and in it a contestant from Costa Rica  pronounced the sound \"rr\" in \"rio\" and \"Costa Rica\" with a sound that was very close to the English r in \"red.\" (But I read it somewhere that it wasn't actually the English r in \"red\"). I wonder what could be the reason for it. How do you describe this sound? Where else can this phenomenon be seen in the Spanish-speaking world? ",

        "text": "Recently I've been following /r/OneWordBan, and linguistically, it's really interesting, I thought I'd bring it up on here. The main concept of the sub is every day or so, some word gets banned. You can't say this word in any posts on the sub (or any tense/variation of it, e.g. walk, walks) lest you be banned. Users have to find unique ways to talk about the ways (or just lurk around on it, like I do).\n\n​\n\nThe sub advertises itself as\n\n&gt;Destroying the English language, day by day.\n\nbut, I don't really think destroying is the right way to describe what's going on. From what I've seen, the whenever a word gets banned, an almost unanimously accepted equivalent starts to be used across the sub. For example, the world 'ban'  is banned, so users instead say 'hecked'. Just search for 'hecked' on the sub, and you'll see an array of different users, ever since it was banned using it in the same way. Sure this is incorrect, but I don't think it's just a misuse of the langauge, in the same way a misspelling a word or using the wrong verb conjugation would be. Everyone (nearly) accepts 'hecked' to mean banned, since you can't say banned. It sort of reminds me of AAVE, where it deviates from Standard English in a way that presents itself as incorrect, but within the community that it's used in it's used grammatically consistently. Does this perhaps constitute the start of a unique dialect? Or, is this just an affect of there being a relatively small number of active users on the sub, so the new vocabulary is easily spread, as more of a code, of sorts?\n\n​\n\nFor reference, here are a few features I've noticed about how the sub users have started to talk.\n\n* Everything is explained out, or just the literal definition of what is meant. For example, all country names are banned, so people use common stereotypes of their country of origin. Instead of saying \"The U.S. or \"America\" people use freedom, or the prevalence of the 2nd Amendment (guns) to express they're from The States.\n\n​\n\n* Less common synonyms for banned words become common. Alphabet becomes lexicon, moderator becomes enforcer. Modern English pronouns (only subject and direct object, as of now) have all been banned, so people say myself to mean I, or me, and the use of old English Thou becomes the new \"You\". It's very interesting to watch it be used as commonly and alongside modern English as it is.\n\n​\n\n* Ideograms. These aren't used too frequently as of now, but I think as more and more words become banned they'll get more common. People already use emojis and pictures to represent banned words to an extent though- look for it an you'll certainly see it.\n\n​\n\n* Most interestingly, The English spoken on the subreddit blends all sorts of dialects, from all different time periods and places begin to be used. From what I can see, it's just what's the nearest equivalent to what's being said. Old English is used alongside local variants of English used alongside posh synonyms. It's interesting to say the least.\n\nNormally, I would just dismiss it as a game to see who can go the longest without saying a banned word, but, dare I say, the banishment of all these words is a catalyst to a dialect? I only thought about this because every way to talk about the banned subjects/words seems to be (nearly) unanimously accepted throughout the sub. What do you think?\n\ntl;dr There's this subreddit  ( /r/OneWordBan ) where one word a day is banned from being used. The users work around this in ways that are linguistically, very interesting, and create linguistic features I personally haven't seen used with English before. This, maybe, is a start to a new dialect of English, because whenever a new feature is introduced it's nearly unanimously used throughout the users.\n\n​",

        "text": "To me one of the most interesting things in linguistics is semantic change. In particular, while often they are perfectly sensible on their own, when you get a chain of them you end up with some crazy results. My favourite happens between Old High German _hiwen_ “to marry” and Swiss German _gheia_ “to fall”. The Swiss German Idiotikon has this to say:\n\n&gt; The word of the week: \"gheie/ghyye\" has one of the craziest developments in meaning behind it. Old High German (\"hiwen\") meant \"to get married\". This has resulted in the meaning \"mate\", which is well documented in the older language. \"Mating\" can easily become a swearword - the old Swiss \"Küe-Gehyer\", i.e. \"cow-sleepers\", were scolded - and from this the more general, but today outdated meaning \"plaguing, torturing, mistreating\" developed. Anyone who mistreats someone can throw him to the ground, which brings him to today's meaning. But what is thrown is let go, and with that we would have reached the second meaning of today, namely \"falling\".

For those of you unfamiliar, Ladino is a language with fewer than a half a million speakers globally, but it has a rich literary, musical and documentary history. Because it draws primarily on Spanish vocabulary and is usually written in the Hebrew alphabet, it is sometimes intelligible to speakers of either language, as well as the Judeo-Portuguese language also known as Lusitanic and r/Yiddish.\n\nWe welcome anyone who wants to learn more or already knows more!\n\nthanks,\n\nacey (mod of r/Ladino)\n\nEdits:  typos",

One accepts most people can differentiate but can't do it himself, another angrily refuses to believe anyone can actually hear the difference. A third guy I know, whose accent has th-fronting in it normally, says th-fronting is becoming the norm, and using þ and ð is unusual now. I think this might be because he also can't hear the difference. Or possibly because everyone speaks like that where he lives. \n\nThe change interests me a lot, because the interdental fricatives seem to have turned into 'd' sounds in a lot of languages that have lost them. Do speakers with the change tend to regard it as allophonic? Can they usually differentiate between the two, or not? ",

The problem we had was that our \"foreign-speaking\" subjects knew English too well, so instead of answering to the (often erroneous) translation, they would answer to the original English sentence, making the application look better than it actually was. A disaster when you are trying to scientifically establish the usefulness of your application.\n\nWhat we found was that having them wear headphones, and whenever English was spoken, play **reverse** Chechen (i.e. backwards played) into the headphones, worked amazingly. Try as they might, their brain tried to make sense of those -clearly human- but nonsensical sounds, and they could not focus on the English. Interestingly, forward Chechen did not work; their brain was able to push the normal speech patterns to the side and then focus on the English again.\n\nJust a fun anecdote from many years past.",

        "text": "Many Germanic languages tend to be more on the analytic side of things because of Proto-Germanic's consistent first syllable stress that, very basically speaking, caused less or more involved deletion of unstressed syllables, weakening the old fusional declension and conjugation systems dependant on suffixes, almost completely in case of English, slightly less so in eg. Dutch or German. One of the reasons for French's unique phonology has also been consistent first syllable stress which led to similar processes as in the Germanic languages.\n\nHowever, the Czech language has very consistent first syllable stress yet it still remains strongly fusional by suffixation, without any signs of vowel weakening or syllable deletion. I was unable to find any information on the internet when did the fixed stress develop, was it somewhere recent and that's why the phonological processes common in Indo-European languages with fixed first syllable stress didn't occur yet? Why is Czech so weakly influenced by its first syllable stress where other European languages really changed their phonologies as well as structures as a result of developing it?",

But like stress in French, I'm having a very hard time hearing barely anything, if at all. I can hear pitch differences in questions but in other statements like a declarative statement, I don't hear this falling pitch that I'm supposed to be hearing. If I have to be honest, except for questions and statements express surprise, I hear no change in pitch; spoken french for the most part sounds very smooth and flat in terms of stress as well as intonation. **So I guess my question is: What is the actual reality of intonation in French?** I feel like this may be similar to how stress is described in French phonology: where it's described as being more detailed than it actually is used in the language, as each syllable gets an even amount of stress in French. A vast majority of materials I find online about intonation of French are exclusively for questions so that makes me wonder are questions the only type of sentence where intonation is important?",

Is there any merit in this? Alternatively, could it be that the story is way more complex in a way that's just not reflected in writing, because writing was kept very formal? Or something else? ",
