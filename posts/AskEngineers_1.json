I want to use these two pumps to generate a flow through a container so that it would reduce the concentrations of volatiles faster than using pump1 alone. \n\nIf I connect them as pump1 -&gt;container-&gt; pump2, will I be able to estimate the flow rate using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation using 'a+b' as the pressure gradient?",

For a little context, I have seen videos on the socials about gear setups with high gear ratios where one can turn a input gear for the entire life of the universe only to get one cycle in the output. Essentially, the input gear moves fast but the output gear moves slow.\n\n I've looked around the internet and have seen only this model/ kind of result and not the otherway around. How understand it, this example is one with a extremely high gear ratio. The question (and I'm sure its possible) is it possible for the input gear to move slow but output gear moves fast\n - a extremely low gear ratio? And maybe to help me design the challenge, what kind of principles are behind it?\n\n if curious, The puzzle being: on a timer and while a gaurdian defends it -  can the characters contruct a series of gears to open a door whose locking mechanism is hidden and designed with a extremely high gear ratio. So no matter how much they turn a exposed gear, it will never open the lock in their lifetime unless they contruct a combination of gears that produces a extremely low gear ratio to counteract the exposed high gear ratio.  If they don't solve it in time the ritual is a success and the final boss becomes more difficult.",

From what I'm reading online, it's highly unusual for a rafter system not to have a rafter or collar tie.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the rafters on both sides are sagging and I'd like to support them at mid-span, and rehabilitate where needed.

I wanted to see what other ideas had before the project starts. Zipline is about 800 ft. long with the belly of the zipline being at about 700 ft. where you hit the primary brake. The primary brake is a 3-1 pully system attached to a HeadRush zip stop unit. The secondary brake is about another 50 ft. down the line which is a Self Retracting Lanyard (SRL) attached to a spring brake. All the braking systems are on a separate cable called the brake line. I was going to put a picture in but I can't so you are stuck with my poor description.\n\nThe question is I want an emergency brake for if all else fails. It is really easy to make something that will stop them, but making something that won't damage the 3/16\" galvanized airline cable or the 1/8\" brake line is another beast. I have an idea drawn up, but I can't convince myself that it wouldn't damage the cable. Want other ideas to see what others got or any general advice. I am going to put an emergency brake on there because I'd rather deal with replacing the expensive cable than a person crashing into the support pillar at the bottom.\n\nFor reference, our brake system is one of 4 used across the United States and none of them have an emergency brake. I understand that last sentence makes it seem that this emergency brake is not needed. I am still going to be putting one in because I don't want anyone getting hurt.",

It doesn't have to be medical devices either. I'd love to hear about what you did day-to-day and any complaints/things you really enjoyed. What did you like? Dislike? How was the compensation?\n\nIt seems pretty hard to get a feel for the various jobs mechanical engineering has to offer without actually working one yourself, so I figured I'd try here.",

The idea is close up the left side door, and expand the right side door to a 6ft opening. We are in a 1910 house so the wall is wood frame with brick insulation in between the studs, which makes this project interesting. This is the first floor, the wall goes through the second floor, and in the attic you can see brick between the studs if you look between the subfloor gaps. Is this worth hiring a SE for, or are they going to tell us this is extremely cost prohibitive? Ideally our budget is $5000 but $10,000 is still in the realm of doable. Located in NYC so obviously, on the higher end of most cost estimates. Follow up Q: how does one go about hiring a SE for this kind of project?

On top of the column, is a 15 ft 10x6 LVL joist which spans from the support to the exterior wall. My idea was to get a second LVL, marry them together with a steel flitch plate, and extend it to the next support which is part of a wall I intend on keeping. The purpose of this is to remove an internal wall which will open up the living space entirely.\n\nMy question is: will this support the roof? And if yes, how long should the steel plate be in order to fasten the two joists together safely?",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI've been chewing on this idea for a while and thought I'd ask a larger community. A common issue for nuclear is that it is difficult to dynalically adjust the power output to meet demand. So, in a breakdown of power sources, nuclear covers the lowest base load with something highly adjustable, like LNG covering the dynamic load.\n\nHowever, would there be methods of \"wasting\" the energy from nuclear in a productive way? One of the thoughts that popped into my head were massive pumps to pump water up into a dam (energy that can be recovered later with generators if desired).\n\nIt simply may not be feasible given the sheer quantity of energy or economic to \"waste\" the energy given LNG is reasonably cheap, but I thought I'd put it out there as a thought experiment.",

During my Undergrad/Graduate programs in Engineering, I used and practiced solid modeling in SolidWorks and Inventor, but was too busy with my coursework to work on obtaining certifications. Now that I've graduated, I have the time to practice using these software packages, and ironically have limited/no access to them. \n\nI was able to get 3DExperience SolidWorks for Makers via a monthly subscription and I used this to obtain my CSWA cert (and plan to continue to use it in order to obtain my CSWP cert). My problem is on the FEA side. SolidWorks Simulation is not included within this license. I'd like to continue to grow my FEA knowledge/experience, and to be able to prove that I know how to use the software by having certifications. Any ideas on how I can get access to SolidWorks Simulation or Autodesk Inventor (or any other FEA software for which I can obtain a certification) without paying out the nose for a license?  I don't plan to use the software for actual product design--only knowledge growth--but there doesn't seem to exist a \"continuing education\"-style of option.\n\n3DExperience SolidWorks for Makers:\n\n[https://www.solidworks.com/solution/3dexperience-solidworks-makers](https://www.solidworks.com/solution/3dexperience-solidworks-makers)",

For example: you might want to create some lightweight pistons for your car - ok, no problem, let me just research how the engine works in some more detail; get a thorough idea of the demands placed on the piston; and how to improve on the existing design - and then, bam! You can get started since you have all the skills required to apply this new set of knowledge. That's the kind of engineer I'd love to be, if possible. \n\nI hope that makes sense? I'm sure that there's no basic bachelor degree that covers all of this - but I at least hope to find the one that covers the most of what I'm describing anyway. But would it be product design and development? Mechanical design engineering? Manufacturing engineering? \n\nWhilst cost and marketing are huge parts of engineering that are always important to consider - I'm more interested in the bespoke side of things where the 'taking it to mass production' is only considered once you've actually completed the 'proof of concept' work first, if you know what I mean?\n\nThanks for your time!",

It would be attached to one ledger then span 11’ for about 3’ of the 7’ width. The remaining 4.5’ would be fully supported by the ledger boards.

The posts would hang from above, attached to one or two steel i-beams that span the 14’ distance.
