        "text": "As the title says, I just finished book one of the series, and I enjoyed it, but not enough to really drive me into the next books. One thing that continually frustrates me is the casual behaviors of the characters. It seems super shallow and cliche. \n\nTake Holden for example. He seems so incredibly immature for someone in his position and with his experience. The constant quips and dry humor are frustrating to me. Him being so upset at not having coffee is what made me stop the second book. Telling people how \"cranky\" he will be, it's like he's not a captain of a warship but a college student bragging about their caffeine addiction. \n\n\nFurthermore, some writing just confuses me. Mainly the characters inconsistency. Like Miller being all pessimistic at the idea of young belters joining the OPA to fight for their dreams or patriotism or whatever. But then obsessing over Julie who was doing the same exact thing. \n\nBut that's not a huge issue. I just want to know if the Marvel-esque casual dialogue that nearly every single character uses, and is completely immersion breaking continues through the series or not. Because I feel like the authors just self-inserted into most of the characters, and there is little to no variety.",

This despite being an English major and taking a few graduate classes towards my Masters in the past couple of years. \n\nWritten in 1934, it is an absolutely fantastic read so far. The prose is energetic, the description compelling, and the main character's doomstruck journey is riveting. Mind you, my opinion might change by the I finish it, but right now I love it. \n\nAnother is Angle Of Repose by Wallace Stegner. Read it three times. It's a fictionalized history of his family's movement into the American West. Absolutely beautiful. \n\nYet, it's hard to find anyone who has read either of these. \n\nAre there any books you think are superb that seem to have been lost in the mists of time?",

The band members literally lose a member due to war and it's never brought up again. The emotional deepness of this book feels fake, the relationship between the brothers feels fake, even the \"love triangle\" just feels forced. \nIt honestly surprised me how many people on Goodreads praise this book, it's one of the times that I just wonder if I accidentally read the wrong thing.",

Therefore, if you just finished a book on your own and want to discuss it, you have to either join a club that happens to be reading the same book or create your own club, which comes with all of the responsibilities of running it. \n\nContrary, I’m inquiring about the ability to jump into a discussion thread about one book after I have read it (sort of like a social media comment thread), where I can comment, ask a question, etc. and anyone who has read the same book at any point in the past can chime back in and add to the discussion.

This is just for personal reading so I’m not going full historian mode or writing essays in my free time or anything like that.\n\nOne thing I’m trying, at least for the historical topics I’m most interested in, is to read increasingly longer and more in-depth books on that topic. I might start with a 150-page “introduction to” book, then read a 300-page “regular” book, then a 500-page in-depth book or perhaps another 300-page book on a narrower subtopic.\n\nI’ve read that historians and (formal) history students don’t read secondary-source history books like “a novel” and do things like reading the first and last paragraphs of each chapter first and do that for each paragraph in the chapter and skim through for the main arguments and stuff like that. And of course taking notes and being more analytical. This of course works for more academic reading, but what about for hobbyists? You could read a book any way you want, but how do you read if you want to get more than just “passively reading” a history book “like a novel”?\n\nDo you use “read like a historian” strategies? Take notes and highlight important details? Write essays on your own? Keep track of references to look up later? Read more passively and watch YouTube videos and documentaries? Skim through the entire book/chapter once to get the main points and arguments then reread the more important sections more closely?\n\nIs there any merit to my “increasingly in-depth” multi-book strategy?",

        "text": "When I was a teenager, I used to frequent the local library a lot. They had a good selection of literature and one portion was set aside labeled teen fiction.  \n\n\nThere was a series of books that I read that fall in the Science Fiction category that I've been trying to find again because I remember the stories being incredible and I wanted to read them again.  \nI've tried finding the books on the internet, but to no avail. As a last resort, I'm turning to reddit to try and find that book.  \n\n\nNow, to explain the books in a bit more detail, it's about teenagers who gain a super power when they reach the age of 16. As I recall, there were about 4 or 5 of these teenagers, one of them in particular being a girl.  \n\n\nOne of the teenagers suddenly became able to understand and speak any language at all. Even computer sounds were interpreted into language he could understand. He could even speak to ants and tell them to do different things  \n\n\nAnother one of the teenagers (I don't remember if it was the girl or one of the other guys) had the ability to do just about any martial arts in the world, ever. I remember a scene from the book where they were training in a dojo and one of the 'senseis' was fighting her, but they completely pulverized the sensei in combat.  \n\n\nAnother one of the teenagers had the ability to shape shift. They could turn into anyone, regardless of age, gender or race.  \n\n\nI can't remember the other powers unfortunately, but it got to a point where these teenagers were facing an alien threat together. The only way to know that they were aliens were to look into their eyes and only see a black disk where eyes would be. The kid who could shapeshift was captured by one of the aliens and 'cloned'\n\nThis \"clone\" was brainwashed and worked for the aliens for a time, until the mind of the teenager (who it was originally of) took over and helped the other teenagers.  \n\n\nI read these books about 15 years ago, so they might be a bit old in terms of books, but I really want to find this series again because I thought it was genuinely amazing  \n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't remember any names of any of the characters, book names or the author.",

Still, I was blown away. It truly is a masterpiece.\n\nI couldn't put it down because there were so many questions: the where, why, and how. &gt;!As it turns out, like the women and the child, I'll never find out. I wasn't upset like I thought I'd be. I realise that was part of the experience, that not all questions have answers, but you can choose to find peace with it, or joy at discovering yet another question.!&lt;\n\nAnother thought that struck me was how extraordinary the ordinary life is. We really do take many things for granted.\n\nThe perspective of time was also fascinating, like how at the beginning, &gt;!the other women were using the narrator to gauge time, and at the end of the book, time was no longer meaningful to the narrator because she had no one to interact with.!&lt;\n\nAnd the biggest theme of all: what it means to be human. This was a recurring theme and I loved that there was a different answer each time. &gt;!Whether they struggled to survive, or succumbed to the despair, or accepted death with pride and dignity. Whether they enjoyed solitude or company. Whether they made time to think or not. I don't think any of them were less human than the other. All of them were, human and only human.!&lt;\n\nI want to thank the redditors who recommended this book and pay it forward by recommending it to those who have not read it.

What are some of your favorite characters, parts or quotes? Which parts did you find confusing?\n2. What makes this story \"the story of all women in the war?\" Why is this important to Calliope and inevident to her poet? What does it mean that her mind is unmade up regarding Helen?\n3. Why do Hecabe and Andromache hold such conflicting opinions of the absent Trojan women?\n4. What role do the Gods serve in this human drama and is this different from how other renditions of mythos portray them? Could this be said to be a story of Goddesses as well?\n5. What other questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Which unanswered questions are the most interesting to you?\n6. BONUS: What would be a good artist or song to accompany the reading thus far?\n\nReminder that second discussion will be posted on Friday, March 10th and will cover up to and including Chapter 17.",

        "text": "What do you want to be when you grow up\n\nOne of the most common questions that adults ask children is, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" For many children, this question can be both exciting and overwhelming. It's an opportunity for them to dream about the future and imagine all the possibilities.\n\nSome children know exactly what they want to be from a young age, while others may change their minds multiple times throughout their childhood.

It was the third book in the series, although if someone can just name the series I always wanted to go back and read the first two. The general gist was that the Holy Roman Empire had become the point of convergence on a pair of time travelers, one seeking to conquer a vastly less technologically advanced world and another, who's consciousness was compressed into a gem that the main character kept on his person at almost all times, who sought to prevent this fate. The main character was a general of the Roman Army, and married a former slave turned military officer in her own right. The gem's influence led to the Romans learning how to use certain technologies that otherwise would not have become widespread at that point, I think they'd recently been shown how to make and use gunpowder for example. And amidst all the time travel stuff, they also had to figure out how to navigate the mundane military and political landscapes to keep the Roman Empire in one piece.",

This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.\n\n* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n____\n\n**How to get the best recommendations**\n\nThe most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.\n\n____\n\nAll Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.\n\nIf this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.\n               \n- The Management",

One small bit that I found puzzling and kept thinking of while reading through the rest of the book, was the extremely brief encounter Glanton has with the Herbalist. It's listed in Chapter 14 summary page as \"An Herbalist\", and occurs on page 197. \n\nThis interaction seems like it begins with the potential for a lot of meaning, or philosophical dialogue, but the whole thing is very brief and uneventful. It seems to have no context and appears out of nowhere. Or maybe I'm missing something? Can't seem to find anything online about this interaction either. Anyway, here it is, would love to hear peoples theories about what this interaction could mean (I don't speak any Spanish, so I translated it with google translate, hope it's correct)- \n\n\" *….Pale cascades hung down the sheer mountain wall above them, blowing off of the high slick rock in wild vapors. In eight days they passed no other riders. On the ninth they saw an old man trying to get off the trail below them, caning a pair of burros through the woods. As they came abreast of this spot they halted and Glanton turned into the woods where the wet leaves were shuffled up and he tracked down the old man sitting in the shrubbery solitary as a gnome. The burros looked up and twitched their ears and then lowered their heads to browse again. The old man watched him.*  \n*Por qué se esconde? (Why is he hiding?) said Glanton.*  \n*The old man didn't answer.*  \n*De dónde viene? (Where does it come from?)*  \n*The old man seemed unwilling to reckon even with the idea of a dialogue. He squatted in the leaves with his arms folded. Glanton leaned and spat. He gestured with his chin at the burros.*  \n*Qué tiene allá? (What do you have there?)*  \n*The old man shrugged. Hierbas (Herbs), he said.*  \n*Glanton looked at the animals and he looked at the old man. He turned his horse back toward the trail to rejoin the party.*  \n*Por qué me busca? (Why are you looking for me?) called the old man after him.*  \n*They moved on. There were eagles and other birds in the valley and many....*\"",

I felt sad, even though there was no dramatic ending, it was actually good. Still I felt like there was an empty whole left in my chest after finishing it. This feeling lasted for the rest of the day.\n\nInitially I thought it was due to my difficult relationship to sex (there were a lot of sex scenes in that book), but it's not the first time I felt in such a way after finishing a book I enjoyed (it was more intense this time though).\n\nAfter a little bit of research, I discovered there was such a thing called \"post book depression\", where people feel sad after finishing a book they enjoyed. I think this happens, because you get attached to the characters, the world they're living in and you become a part of it and when it ends you realize that you get separated from them and you are supposed to go back to your sad reality...\n\nDid you experience it? If so, how long did it last and which book that made it especially hard for you to separate from?",

But I also hear there's a SyFy adaptation, and my older brother says that as a fan of the books it's really weird.\n\nMaybe it's a great show for people who never read the books, but I wanna know if it's any good for people who really value the source material. And if it does, is it still a good show regardless?",
