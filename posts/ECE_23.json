D is connected to pin marked A(S1) and C connected to pin marked B(S0). It starts out operating normal from 0-4 and then things go in weird orders. \n\nPhoto of breadboard (it's a busy circuit but I tried to make it clean, hopefully it's not too hard to see) Two muxes are on upper breadboard, and the order of the others goes 555 193 7404 7432 7408:  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/XQFsgbP.jpg\n\nGif of operation: https://gfycat.com/AggravatingBestAmurminnow\n\nI feel like I must be missing something fundamental in putting this together, since the solution derived from the k-maps should just implement the function, right?

It is ageing but even advanced students interested in memory systems architecture, network on chip design or advanced ILP techniques implemented should check this out. It’s in plain ol Verilog. You can really cut your teeth with ESL, converting this to systemC for TLM, using SystemVerilog with OVM, chip synthesis practice, benchmark analysis, operating systems kernel design, multiprocessor operating systems design, converting to Chisel/Scala, and more. \n\nLook at the folder architecture, it honestly starts looking like a mess.

It’s mixes of like twenty authors over years using company Ip that’s often old as shit or totally trash.

I think it can do onboard connections as well and not just in the air with an h-probe or monopole antenna. I want to directly connect the SMA to the board to do some frequency response analysis. \n\nI want this to characterize microwave circuits sub 1Ghz, and active devices as well as passive. I'd like to eventually compare my results with simulated data from the .s2p or spice files manufacturers provide to validate my designs while I work through Razavi and Pozar. \n\nDo you guys think that VNA is worth the money? I was going to do Henriks, but it seems like  he doesn't recommend it for active devices just yet. I rather not fuck around doing instrumentation design. I will if I have to but I much rather not. \n\nIt doesn't need to be the most precise thing in the world obviously, I just want to do the necessary analysis so I can validate my designs that I do for homework by myself/labwork by myself. I don't exactly have super easy access to a VNA per my other posts lol. \n\nI'd like to spend less than 1k for both the VNA and SA, I realize how absolutely ridiculous that sounds given the equipment and it being RF but hey can't a guy dream?

I'm not a controls person my self by anymeans but I thought the kalman filter explanation was quite approachable. It isn't inundated with math jargon that's usually found in controls books, partly because it's an intro book. I enjoyed reading it vs reading Nise but your own mileage my vary. I found this book much better at state space analysis than Nise. Controllability and Observability being such huge topics yet so poorly done in Nise was really frustrating, for example. \n\nThe python library is quite handy as well, makes it so I don't have to go to matlab and any practice I do I first derive using Sympy and then convert the transfer function with this. \n\nYou might be using scipy.signals to get pole/zero and bode, but I like the overall cohesiveness of this package. \n\nThe textbook comes with good example code, one regarding a simulated VTOL takeoff.

There's some good lead on work which they want me to do, and they're relatively loaded as far as academia goes, so they offered to sponsor a PhD pretty well. They wanted a masters, and I suspect they might be able to sponsor a master's project too, but haven't looked into it. \n\nI think the options look something like this:\n\n1) IC design - stay on for the sponsored masters, and get hired on 80kish when I graduate. \n\n2) IC design - take the bachelors and run, get hired on 80kish when I graduate. \n\n3) Quantum Computing - stick around for the masters either with the IC design guys ($$$) or in QC (???), then do a PhD (45k tax free).\n\n4) Quantum Computing - take the bachelors and go straight into a PhD (45k tax free)\n\nI'm keen on both fields. Perhaps leaning a bit more towards quantum computing since it's so challenging and cutting edge. I don't care much for the PhD as a title or anything, but it's the best way into Quantum Computing for me. Earnings would most likely be supplemented a bit with teaching.\n\nThere is a bunch of course work in the masters I'd like to do, from the belief that investing in your own ability is the best investment you can make, but realise that if I've got other options, it's really not necessary.\n\nWhat do you'll think?

Well, my teammates are testing the sensor by connectin a resistor to the output and hence gettin a  voltage that can be read  by the ADC, however it sounds off to me. Why is there opams circuits that covert current to voltage then? And on top of this, the results those guys got are not linear nor log nor exp, they told me that the best approximattion (which btw is not good either) is an 8 coeff equation. Sounds off to me. Do you think this is related to the resistor? Should we try an opamp CV converter instead? What are the advantage of these circuits over just using resistors? \n\nIve been doing some reading by myself but Id like to get some other opinions from the community.\n\n\nThanks guys. :)\n\nEdit: The sensor is a [Draw Wire Encoder] ( http://www.roundssencoder.com/news_images/20150316203803595.pdf) we are using the 20mA one\n\nADC used was an Arduino Uno ADC",

I know nothing about them other than that they are modulated via GFSK. The information is proprietary, so I'm having to guess the number of tones/symbols used in these transmissions. I've tried getting in touch with their tech support for over a month now and have had very little luck, so I've had to do a fair bit of reverse-engineering to get to this point.\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/a/LQ4UO) plot shows two strong tones on the edges, but there appear to be two (and perhaps more) weaker tones in the very middle. Is there a way I can determine if these are actual symbols used in modulation? Or perhaps these are just a byproduct of frequency instability in the receiver?",

The signalling I'm trying to capture is up to 24,000 Hz and sometimes quite weak (low light).  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a device that outputs 5v over USB that doesn't also include some (or a lot) of noise that interferes with some of my measurements.  \n\nI suspect batteries might be the simplest solution, but I'd like to avoid carrying around extras if I can.  I did try a USB battery bank but the power draw through the diode is so little that it doesn't seem to activate the battery bank at all. \n\nAny ideas as to how I can clean up the 5v power supplied by USB ports?  Many thanks for your help.\n\n",
