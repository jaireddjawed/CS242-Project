        "text": "So two or three nights ago I was sleeping in bed and kept being woken up by my bed being forcefully shook. Every time I’d sit straight up and turn my phone light on. This went on for intervals of 35-40 minutes. Each time After looking around I would see nothing and go back to bed. This went on two or three times before I was poked/hit awake, at first I thought maybe it was a family member coming to wake me up. This is fairly common because it’s easy for me to sleep in with my blackout curtains. Well when I opened up my eyes I saw at my side a dark shadowy figure with whiteish eyes where the middle faded into black, there was this unnerving grin which seemed as though it was proud of some grand joke I had fallen for. The thing that has me convinced that it wasn’t a case of sleep paralysis is that I could move when I saw it I immediately started grabbing for my phone to turn on the light. When I finally got the light on it was gone. Now I hate to be a stereotype but when I saw this figure it was 3:34am. So any thoughts on what happened, or anything really. I’m really unsure about the whole thing and would like some input. Thanks.",

        "text": "I moved into this house with my boyfriend at the beginning of November, around the 4th, of 2022. I've always had a weird feeling when I'd come to visit as my boyfriend lived here with roommates before I moved in with him.\nOver time my mental health started to take a downfall. For context: I've been diagnosed schizo-effective bipolar. Diagnosed at 19 and have been medicated since. My symptoms are manageable and I have coping skills that keep me grounded and my meds help alot. I still struggle with social anxiety and some small delusions centered around that but I can usually keep myself in reality and push those thoughts away especially when I've been taking my meds regularly. \nWhen I first moved in I was taking my meds p regularly and only missed maybe one or two days a month (I know I need to take them every day but sometimes I'd just forget) and even before moving in had lived alone for months without any sort of issue coming up. Almost immediately I started having random bouts of anger, sadness or panic-like anxiety and all would leave me in a broken crying mess. I started struggling to sleep, only getting 3 or 4 hours a night if that. Eventually I did run out of my meds and because of this sudden change in my mood and the lack of sleep I haven't had the energy to sit through another appointment. \nWhich is where my problem comes in. For awhile now (even on my meds) but not right after i moved in, maybe for the past month, I've been feeling uneasy and not safe. Just general feelings of unease and anxiety. My boyfriend left to rehab for alcoholism treatment (long story. He's getting the help he needs and wants and I support him 100% so please refrain from judgement) about a week ago, and 4 days ago I walked out of our bedroom to find the front door just standing wide open. Thought it was weird and it did freak me out but I looked around and didn't see anything so I just figured maybe it was the wind or a vortex caused by me shutting the bedroom door after going to the bathroom ?? Idk everything logical though it did give me a bad feeling. After that I went about my day and the sun went down, and I started to feel this really really heavy feeling in my room. Like just an anxious, dreadful feeling that wouldn't go away and it almost was like coming from the window on the other side of the room. Again just tried to think logically and rationally as I do to cope and told myself I was just freaking myself out and being delusional and whatever but just could not shake this feeling. It was overwhelming. I kept having to sit up in bed while trying to sleep to check if anything was actually standing there and I never saw anything but it just felt like it. There's a TV directly to the left of the window I was feeling this coming from, and at one point I opened my eyes after trying to sleep and saw that the TV had turned itself on at some point. That freaked me out but I tried to just ignore it and do my best to not acknowledge whatever was going on and pass it off as coincidence and me being overly paranoid. But it's been days and I'm still just generally uneasy and unsafe feeling, which gets worse when the sun goes down. So much so I can't sleep until it's daylight again and still for only maybe 3 or 4 hours sometimes less. \nBasically the point of this ramble is am I being delusional? I know I need to get back on my meds and I am working on that, but do you think that the door being open and my TV turning on and the intense feeling could be something more??? I'm going to leave for my mom's in the morning because it's getting to the point where it's too much and I'm overwhelmed. What can I do???",

        "text": "Okay so for this story I will refer to my friends as bride maid of honor, and niece because this was a Bachelorette trip. \n\nSo it will be a year in March my friends and I went to Chattanooga TN to celebrate my childhood best friends marriage. It was a beautiful house on the Tennessee River very private and peaceful atmosphere. It was on a nature trail so it felt very isolated though it was close enough to the city for us to go out and have fun. \n\nAnyway we all had a great time in the city then came back and started a fire in the firepit we hung out until we all got tired and eventually went to bed. We all decided to bunk in the same room that had 3 double bunks and one full bed it was a large room and we thought we could all watch a movie together in there but ended up all deciding we needed sleep to hike to drive back the next day.\n\nAs my friends are used to falling asleep early I am not so I was still wide awake so I got on my phone and started scrolling. I know bad habit but I had no ther options of reading a book or anything. So ad I'm laying there I get this feeling..and it's not a good feeling. I have had one paranormal experience before this and it didn't make me feel scared I just felt confused. This was different. I felt my hairs stand up like that feeling of something with ill intent was near me. I look up at the other bunks my friends look fine. So I continue scrolling then I get the feeling again I look up and this time I look towards the full sixe bed where the bride and her little niece who tagged a long was. And I see a dark figure, head bent looking down at the neice my heart stopped. I couldn't not move. I kept thinking to myself its just a shadow from the stairway light coming in the room. I look down at my phone and get the courage to move my thumbs to text my boyfriend how scared I was.. which didn't help considering he's not a believer in anything of that nature so he just says you're just seeing things. After this I look up the figure is gone. Which did not make me feel better only worse because it only confirmed what I saw was not in fact a shadow from the light in the stairway. \n\nSo I jumped from my bunk and bolted up the stairs and crashed on the couch I felt like a small child who just watched a horror movie. I kept hearing what sounded like creaking from the stairs I thought of the old phrase \"its just the house settling\" to calm myself then called my boyfriend and he talked me down and I thought he's probably right but I was still shaken up. Eventually feel asleep around 4 am when the creaking stopped. But woke up around 6 and got the courage to go downstairs to get into my bag for clothes. A few minutes later the maid of honor comes up and she looks confused wnd kind of freaked out then says \" hey did the bride come up here at all\" I said when because I only slept 2 hours and I've been up since 6 she says well I mean about that time I thought I saw her up and go up the stairs. I said no she didn't come up here and she says well I know I saw someone go up the stairs. Her face was white and I said did you check the bed and she said well I thought I saw someone standing between their suitcases and the bed over her niece. That's when my heart dropped and she knew I didn't have to say anything my face said it all. She knew I saw it too. Needless to say we were happy to get out and not investigate. I felt guilty I didn't stay downstairs after she confirmed what I saw however I was convinced that it was just my anxiety and my boyfriend being very skeptical made me think maybe I was over reacting but the look on my friends face of pure confusion and fear confirmed it. \nI don't know if it's related but a few months later I learned one of the supposed most haunted places in Tennessee Hale's Bar is located just 2 miles on the river from this location. Also there was this really old cabin from the 1800s. They had decorated for looks on the property and it definitely had some weird vibes too. It didn't help that they had these old pictures inside of it of the owners I wish I remembered the names so I could see if they had any correlation to the Hales Bar Marina.",

        "text": "Hey guys, I’ve seen people on here post about their experiences of paranormal and family home hauntings so I thought I would share mine. \n   \nI am 24 now and I no longer experience any hauntings. \n\nEver since I could remember my family would experience things like footsteps and doors closing on their own. Once my mom got married to a guy (let’s call him Ben) we moved into this 2 story house. The first few months in that house were fine. After a while I would see stuff like shadows from the corner of my eye. One time my moms husband was sleeping and he said someone threw his shoes at him. Their bedroom is on the second floor. He got up and was lookin around to see what was happening and everyone was asleep. He didn’t find any shoes near him. \n Another incident was with my uncle who was living with us at the time. This happened in broad daylight. He walked out of his room to get something from the laundry room and when he tried to go back in his room, the hair dresser was blocking the door. We didn’t know how because there was no one else in his room. \n My older sister told me that one night she was doing homework in the living room and she hears what sounded like me screaming. She said that she started to yell for me asking what’s wrong and where was I. She started looking around and there was no one home. \nWe use to hear and see the front door knob shaking and moving dramatically like if someone was turning the knob over and over again. \n Another time we found a footprint in the kitchen to be way smaller than anyone’s foot in the house. \n Mmm uncle was making food and I was standing right next to him while he was grabbing a tortilla and he stops in the middle of his tracks and freezes. He looks at me and asks me if I had just grabbed his hand. I didn’t…\nLater my mom divorced her husband and we move to a 1 story house. For a while we thought the paranormal things stopped. We would hear footsteps but thought nothing of it and told ourselves it was the house settling in. \nFast forward to 2019 my mom decided to remodel the house and put hardwood floors in (we had carpet). They were done by March of 2020 with the whole house. And I would constantly hear heavy footsteps and feel like someone was watching me. My mom moved to Bakersfield and my sister worked a lot so I stayed by myself most of the time. I would hear the silverware moving. Papers rustling in the living room. At night is when I would hear like someone walking with boots on. But it always happened on the opposite side of the house, never on the side of the house I was in. \nLater my older sister moves in for a month because she was waiting on her new home to be finished. She told me that she was laying down in the living room and she heard the heavy footsteps walking towards her and stop right behind her. \nNothing bad ever happened really. \nI no longer live there but when I do go and spend the night, I still feel like someone is watching me. \n\nI have a lot more stories if you guys want me to share.",

Personally I prefer to sleep in the dark but my room is on the second floor on the street side which means a lot of light comes through my curtains, unnerving me. I cant say it impacts my daily life negatively, but it’s unnerving for sure.\n\nLast night I was in bed and this light, sweet scent filled my nose suddenly. I’ve mentioned in two posts that I’ve always been subject to the paranormal although my experienced are few and far between. I sometimes smell things (usually pleasant smells) that aren’t caused by anything I can see, I don’t wear perfume so it can’t be that, plus my sense of smell isn’t the strongest and my nose is often stuffy, which makes it odd that I can smell these things so clearly. Does anyone know what this might be?",

        "text": "Right! People say stories are only stories and don't compare to actually experiencing something yourself. I'm going to tell you three eye witness accounts from my perspective as they happened. \n\nStory number one!\n\nThe first story is an account involving two of my younger brothers. When we were kids, our parents moved. We moved to a five acute property. There are nothing but crop farms and cattle farms for kilometres. We lived right on the corner of a cross section. The house is an old Queenslander, which is a two story house. It is located in one section up near the roads. If we face off the veranda to the road, we have a paddock to the left, a paddock out the back with a dam and a paddock out the back to the left. To the right is a dirt road leading from the cross section down passed out back paddock The property is a big rectangle. \n\nAnyways, once I was walking into the back yard and I saw my two younger brothers down the back. We were only young. I would have been about seven or eight at the time. So, Chrys would have been give or six and Josh would have been three or four. I walk over to them to see them both holding their hands in their faces crying. I asked them what's up and they started telling me this story about how they saw this big white ghost across the road in the neighbours paddock. \n\nAt first I didn't believe them. I figure it was a lie, but they insisted. I looked into their teared up eyes and I saw genuine fear. I knew they had seen something. Chrys described they ghost. He said \" At first I thought it was just a big plastic bag floating along, but hen it stopped and looked right at us. And then it flew behind that tree and disappeared.\"\n\nI looked a the tree he pointed at. It wasn't a very big tree, but had a. Lot of branches off of it so you couldn't see behind it. I just insisted that we go up to the house. So we did. \n\nStory number two!\n\nRight, so in the last story, we spoke about my parents property. Well, to this day, they still live there. They have been there now thirty years. The property has changed a bit is still the same property. \n\nAnyways, the second story takes place on my parents property again. This is years later. I was nineteen at the time. I was out at my parents visiting. At this time, my ex girlfriend and my brothers best firned were there. My parents had built a new staircase From the veranda. It went straight out from the house, half way down, it splits to go down both directions, left and right. There is a flat landing half way where the stairs split. I'm standing on this platform talking to my ex, Naomi, and my brothers best friend, Adam.\n\n\nI'm talking away to them, telling them some story. While I'm telling it, they are both all ooko g at me, both with a bit of a smile, both fully intrigued on what I was saying. My back was turned toward the road. As I was speaking, I saw both of them turn there eyes and look past me at somthing behind me. The both turned and looked at the same time. Then, both of their faces turned white at the same time. Both of their jaws dropped at the same time. She started to scream. \n\nI turned around to see what they were looking at and there was nothing there. I looked back at them and they both started telling me how this big white ghost just appeared in the middle of the road right behind me looking at us. It was standing there looking at us. How it disappeared the moment I turned around to look at it. The fear in their eyes was so real. They definitely saw something. What ever they saw, they both witnessed it right in front of me. \n\nI just kinda smiled and said, \"I think Chrys and josh saw the same one when we were kids.\" I mad it into a big joke how it must be scared of me because it doesn't want me to see it.\n\nStory number three!\n\nWell, the first two stories are based on my parents property, so obviously the third is based on the same property again. This is years later after the second account. I was having some issues, just went through a bad breakup and was staying with my parents again for a while. My uncle was also going through some difficulty. His girlfriend and their kids were staying in tents down beside my parents house. On the other side of their tents was a bus that my nan was living in at the time. On the other side of her bus was the side paddock, with has steal and cars and stuff in it at this time. I was using a room underneath the house. They had two kids together but she had older kids before they got together. One of her kids was a teenager at the time. His name is Luke. \n\nSo, like, my brother and I would go out into the paddock sometimes and sit in an old car and smoke weed. Luke always had his own, as did his older brother and my uncle. It wasn't allowed tho so we kept it to ourselves and usually only smoked at night. \n\nSo, one night, I've walked out around my nans bus, out into the paddock, over to an old white Mitsubishi Nimbus where we usually chilled. I jumped in the car, knowing Luke was already in there. When I jumped in tho, I turned to see him freaking out at the sight of me. He had tears in his eyes. His hands were shaking. He had them cupped as if he was just crying into his hands or something. Somthin was wrong. I sked him if he was okay. He responded with \"Didn't you see it?\"\n\nI'm like \"See what?\"\n\nHe said to me \"There was a big white ghost man! It just appeared outside of the car. It started shaking the car up and down.\"\n\nHe then told me how he was that freaked out that he he just covered his eyes with his hands and started crying. Then he freaked out because the door opened all he sudden, just to turn and see me. \n\nNow, I know he may have been stoned, but I never spoke to him about this big white ghost before, so I found it pretty strange that he said he witnessed such a thing. Something, again, I didn't witness myself.\n\nNow, my conclusion is there's a big white ghost those roans between the two properties. It won't let me see it tho. I know none of you have been through this tho so I expect you to see these at nothing more than stories. That's the thing about stories. We all experience them in sifferents ways so we all take them differently.",

        "text": "My friend is a Nurse Practitioner who works with the geriatric population and a big part of her job is end-of-life care. She and I barely know each other but she asked me out to dinner yesterday and we got to talking about spirits and what she’s seen on the job. Things were going well until we really dove into this topic and I noticed a change in her pallor. She stared talking about how heavy she feels sometimes with all these spirits hanging on to her and how even though she’s glad she could be there for people at their time of death, it comes with it’s own complications and heaviness in her life. As she was telling me all of this, I suddenly hear the loudest cacophony of inhuman screeching of pain, anger, and sorrow. It was so loud that it drowned out most of the sounds in the restaurant. And it just kept going— a medley of twisted screams, over and over again. I looked around but nobody else in the restaurant seemed to hear it. I thought I was going crazy. Then I started noticing weird things hanging on the windows. Like, dark specters but they weren’t moving. My friend who is normally quite cheerful seemed to be consumed by this negative energy around her and I felt like they were making their presence known to me. I felt so off on the way home and I just kept seeing weird stuff out of the corner of my eye. When I finally got home and laid in bed, everything slowly went back to normal. \n\nI have never experienced something like this before. But everything about our dinner seemed otherworldly and slightly spiritual. I’m still unsure how to process this and whether or not she is someone I should stay away from.",

Eventually I stopped doing it, but I remember that I didn’t think this was something unusual, I just thought that this was something normal that people simply chose not to do, and that should also not do it. Now, looking back at it, I believe I was capable (and perhaps still am) of doing something special and unusual. I haven’t tried doing it again because I remember it could be quite stressful when the volume became too loud. Has anyone ever experienced something similar?",

        "text": "This all happened when I (f25) was around 5/6 years old, and I remember everything like it was yesterday because I've been thinking about that day often, and I've talked to multiple people about it throughout my life. \n\nIt was my mom's birthday, and she invited some of her friends to have a lively party at our house. Most of the people with children were my parent's friends through my older sister's school, so most of the kids were older, and didn't want to hang out with me.\n\nI, on my part, never really liked hanging out with other children, so I was more than happy to stay behind the spiral staircase, drawing on the floor with my crayons. \n\nAt a certain point, I got up to stretch my legs, holding myself with one hand on the side of the wooden staircase, when my legs started coming up on their own. \n\nI found myself hovering midair (at about 2/3 feet from the ground), in an almost sitting position, just lightly holding on to the wood railing to anchor myself. I say sitting to describe the position, but it felt completely free and floaty, very reminiscent of the sensation of weightlessness of some very light turbulences or roller coasters. This lasted for about 30/60 seconds. (? not sure, as it wasn't super quick but it didn't last long.)\n\nThe experience filled me with glee at the time, and I gently pushed my legs down, one at a time, and ran to my parents, dragging them to the staircase and yelling ''Come, come! PLEASE YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS!!'' while giggling.\n\nI then proceeded to grab the staircase and joyously lift my legs, proud and excited, but they dropped down immediately. I  tried to prop them up, a bit confused, to no avail. I tried jumping, helping myself with my arm, and going slowly, one leg at a time, but nothing happened. My parents eventually grew tired, not understanding what I was trying to show them, and left me be. I spent the rest of the night frustrated by the staircase, hanging by the railing, climbing in between the steps, anything just to trigger it again. \n\nIt never happened to me again. Nothing of the sort has ever happened to me since, but it changed my perspective on life: how can I be a person who believes that reason, rather than experience, is the foundation of certainty in knowledge when I myself have experienced something that I cannot explain with reason? \n\nThat's not to say that I'm not a skeptic, as I have talked to multiple people about this, including friends, family, and a therapist, to see if maybe it might have hallucinations, but he didn't believe so ( as I've never had one other than that and I wasn't under a particular amount of stress at the time).  As I got older I even tried going to the gym and trying to recreate the position, but I never could (sometimes children have freaky strength, but I was literally just lightly holding the staircase and there was nothing else to help). \n\nMy parents and sister do remember me mentioning this, but all they remember about the night is me being very grumpy and fussy by the spiral staircase.\n\nIf anybody is curious about this and wants to ask questions, I'll try to answer to the best of my abilities. Even if you're just trying to debunk/rationalize this, I'm all ears, you might have an angle I never explored, or know something I don't, so please comment and ask away!",

        "text": "In late 2014 my ex-husband and I had separated, but still lived together, due to it being a very expensive area to live in. We had separate bedrooms, so it wasn’t too terrible. We also had a young child (toddler age). It was a two story townhome in the middle of a row of townhomes. I was sleeping in the master bedroom, while my ex and kid were in the two front bedrooms.\n\nI frequently have insomnia. So I like to read late at night. I was reading some romance novel and it was around two am when I suddenly became aware of IT. My bedroom door was closed, but I could feel the wrongness on the stairs. Whatever the creature was, it was crouching in the darkness slowly climbing the stairs. I could feel that even the air was still. I opened my bedroom door and looked down the stairs. Nothing was there, but as soon as the light fell on the stairs the feeling of wrongness vanished. It was like the air could suddenly move again. My cat tore up the stairs, dashed under the bed, and did not come back out all night. I decided I was imagining things and was going to go to go to bed. As soon as I closed my bedroom door, I felt the wrongness return.\n\nI ended up turning on my overhead light and keeping my door cracked so it cast a beam of light on the stairs. I tested it, and every time I closed the door, I felt the wrong feeling return and if I turned off my bedroom light, I could feel it creeping up the stairs. I stayed up the whole night, keeping the light on.\n\nOnce the sun rose, I decided I had been imagining things.\n\nAbout 3 months later I moved out, and my boyfriend who is kind of mystical saged our new place before we moved in. My first night there though, I was alone. And I cried in relief most of the night. I hadn’t realized how much low level wrongness I had been feeling for years. But even at this point, I chalked it up to “me being over imaginative.”\n\nTwo years later, my ex was getting ready to move out of the townhome and started talking on social media about it. He expressed how happy he was to be leaving that place because of the THING ON THE STAIRS. I had never told him about it. But he described almost exactly the same feeling of wrongness and the “thing” that would slowly creep up it if he didn’t leave the light on. He is very much a skeptic and repeatedly said “I know this sounds crazy…”\n\nThe fact that I never told him about and I never mentioned it to anyone but he described it so accurately. \n\nAdditional odd note, while we lived there, is and every other family living in this row of townhomes got divorced. While my marriage was never great to begin with, there was a couple that lived next to us that had been married 40+ years, but they also got divorced.\n\nI believe it was a shadow creature, that had it not been held at bay with light, we all would have died to it.",

When he opens the door I’m in the corner of the room, my eyes wide open and I look scared, pointing at the wall above his head. And I keep saying; “This, this, this,” in Chinese. I do remember some of it, I remember being really scared and getting out of bed to hide in the corner but I can’t recall what was there. I talked about it to my dad years later and he confirmed it really did happen. Could there be any explanations? I’m open to any theories/ information.",

        "text": "So, to give a little background, I’ve experienced what I can only rationalize as paranormal happenings since I was young, few and far between but paranormal nonetheless. I’ve actually written about two of my experiences in this subreddit a while back. Fast forward to 2019 I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder depressive type, meaning I have visual and auditory hallucinations from time to time as well as other symptoms but those are the most relevant. Lately I’ve been noticing shadows but they don’t make sense. For example, I will be on my couch, watching a show and right behind my coach are the front windows of the house, but I don’t notice a shadow on the roof as if someone is walking by the lights and they’re casting a shadow however it just doesn’t make sense because the orientation of the shadow Would be as if someone is walking on the inside of the house, and Wisconsin, your shadow, and in those instances, I’m the only one up and awake recently. I heard an extremely loud bang while I was home by myself as if someone slammed on the awning, and I’ve heard the floor creek as if someone stepped on one of the planks on the ground keep in mind I do hallucinate from time to time so I kind of put those to the back of my mind as just hallucinations but this past October I was home alone for about two weeks as my folks went off to Europe on vacation, in lieu of my solitude I invited a fwb over and as they were walking up to my gate that’s in front of my door they stopped in their tracks and just turned around and left. To give you a visual. I have a door gate and then my front door. My front door was open and I was standing behind a closed door gate. I texted them to ask why they suddenly just left with no explanation and they messaged back. It looks like there’s more than one person in the house now again everyone who lives in the house besides me is in Europe and it’s just me. I didn’t push for more info because honestly I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know more but there’s just been these different happenings that just don’t quite make enough sense of and with my mental illness. I’m just not sure if it’s me or something else.",

So I live in a building at the 4th floor above which is the terrace with a penthouse which is empty no tenants for a long time now. I here the sound of footsteps and furniture being dragged from the terrace and not just me this sound is so lound was audible till the 2nd floor last night. But when I go check there's absolutely noone. If I assume that it may come from the floor below me that's not the case either as there have been times when the floor below me was empty too. This sound comes usually in the evening and nights too. This used to happen before too and that was my first post about it in this sub. Now the thing is these noises used to come then they randomly stopped but after almost a year it's happening all over again. Just 10 minutes ago while I was on the terrace I heard some furniture being moved very slightly from inside the penthouse which is locked. Any help or remedies would be helpful to help me get rid of this as Iam really worried.",

Uma noite, eu estava indo até a casa de um amigo que ficava na Lapa, por volta das 23:50 eu  passava pela ponte da freguesia do ó, quando de longe avistei uma garota de aprox 1,60 vindo em minha direção, a rua estava completamente deserta e nem mais os ônibus fretados estavam passando, lembro claramente que todos os pontos de ônibus já estavam vazios. Está menina estava usando um moletom de capuz, cobrindo a parte dos olhos, só dava de ver a boca e os cabelos, o que achei mais estranho, é que ela vinha arrastando um caco de vidro na lateral da ponte. Eu continuei andando tentando não esboçar medo, ela passou do meu lado, tão perto que eu conseguia sentir a respiração, olhei para a sua face e lembro vagamente de um sorriso sádico no rosto dela, e lembro de ver apenas a silhueta dos olhos que pareciam apenas escuridão junto ao capuz. O que me chocou dessa história, é que quando eu saí da ponte, e já estava mais a frente, olhei para trás e esta menina estava simplesmente parada na ponte, me olhando de braços cruzados, diretamente direcionada a mim. Eu não entendo muito bem o que aconteceu até hoje nesse dia, mas gostaria de saber a opinião de vocês, isso não é uma história fictícia, isso aconteceu, e digamos que não foi a primeira vez que me deparo com uma pessoa muito estranha na rua. Qual a visão de vocês sobre isso? Alguém por acaso já passou por algo parecido?",

I would get these dreams so often but they would be about different scenarios, I remember them vividly but one scared me in particular. I came back through my garage because I went biking. It leads to our patio and into the kitchen and I saw my mom cooking through the siding glass door. And in the living room I saw these shadow people staring at her then at me then just hiding in the pantry, cabinets, and our chest autoimmune, etc. They had to be at least 6 feet tall and really slender, but the eyes scared me the most. They were so small and white just burning stares from every point on your body. There had to be like 8-10 that i saw and I still walked in to talk to my mom about it to try and get her out of this situation. But before I even got to mention it to her, she was acting really off, and not like her self. She was cooking so blankly, so I played it off by asking her what she was making. Not shifting what so ever, she she said monotoned “picadillo”. So from then on I played it off and acted like I was going to go upstairs and rest up ,but as I moved through the house I saw these shadow people staring so eagerly then hiding only in my direct point of view. I was so freaked out I just decided to go into my room, pack a bag to stay at a friends house and get the hell out of there, but when I would go into my drawrs  and closet I could see them standing there staring at me in the dark with only their eyes illuminating, but I tried my absolute best to to not pay them any mind. Then right as I was gonna book it out of there they started to slowly emerge out of their hiding and something caught my attention as it appeared on the bottom left of my tv (the part of the screen closest to the door). It was a cross that was colored black and red with detailed designs carved into the whole thing. It was pretty big and fit in my hand like the size of my phone and felt as heavy as a 5 pound weight. And the weirdest past is that something deep inside me told me to take it, so I did. I grabbed it out of the tv and ran. As I was making my way though the house I can see and feel them coming out of hiding and chasing me. I think I managed to get out because I woke up before I can even continue.\nHas anyone seen a cross like that before? If so what dose it mean? This story happened over a year ago and I still can’t get it out of my head. I’m not that much of a religious person so it was kinda weird for me to see one like this. Coming from religious families I’m scared to ask them because I’m genuinely scared it might be something bad. The cross itself was menacing and I guess that’s all I need to know to get part of my answer.",

No cell service, neighbour’s are beyond shouting distance, a very on your own lifestyle out here. My trailer is at the top of this property next to a barn, surrounded 360° with forest except for the little road up here. The mountain “Mount Ida” has a long history with the aboriginal people of my area, i’ve been told stories of the mountain since i was a kid. Basically the summary of every story is “People are banished from the mountain because the spirits make it too dangerous”. All sorts of weird things have been seen and have happened on this mountain. \n\nLast night: Around 10:45PM I heard 3 sets of sirens rush by the road. Out here you never hear sirens. In my accumulative 15 years here I’ve heard  one siren and it was earlier this week. Basically it just intrigued me at that point. Wasn’t until about half hour later or so and my power cuts out. \n\nI’m already in bed at this point, lights were out, only way i actually noticed was because i had no wifi. Now that’s always a heart stopper, cause out here no wifi means I’m entirely on my own. This makes me anxious for sure but I’m more worried that I won’t be able to call the fire department if something catches on fire than anything. \n\nThen out of nowhere I hear this super sharp and loud cry, like a kid who just crashed on a bike. Hysterical crying from what sounds to be a young child. My dogs are going absolutely nuts at the door. Now if you’re familiar with cougars/ML you should know that they can often mimic a child crying, and scary accurately too. So laying there as the tension builds i’m just telling myself it’s a cougar, that’s all it is, just a cougar. For me that’s the best case scenario right now, that it’s just a cougar. \n\nDogs have finally calmed down and I’m still just trying to get some shut eye when I hear the second sound. This was an ungodly sound that I’ve never heard in my life. This one sounded like a mix of every horror movie monster all in one. I can’t even describe it. It was about 5 seconds of pure screeching, like a demonic banshee with the vocal chords of a t-rex. The bass to it shook my bed. It was as if there was a concert sized sound system hiding in the forest blasting zombie vomit. \n\nI could taste my heartbeat at this point. My dogs are acting like rabies ridden pit bulls towards the door, snarling and growling like whatever just screamed was on the other side of the door. I didn’t know what to do at that point, couldn’t call or get in contact with anyone. Lights are all off, Im just laying there in the dark, utterly and completely scared. I was not about to get up and go investigate, it’s the middle of winter of course too. I just laid there checking my phone every 30 seconds seeing if the wifi came back. Nothing else came after though, just ended up falling asleep at some point. \n\nAs of this morning everything is back to normal. Nothing creepy going on, powers back on. Made a post in the local FB group, nobody else in the area heard anything and only a few lost power as well as me. So take it as you will. Cougar in heat? Bigfoot coming out of hibernation? Thousand year old native ghost trying to get me off his land? I’m not a very paranormal guy, and i have no idea what it could’ve been at this point. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, ideas, or questions!",

        "text": "I asked my deceased mom, deceased grandmother and guardian angels for signs. I asked for a 1998 penny to see that my mom was here watching over me and later that day found a handful of coins in my grandparents truck that I was cleaning out and one was a 1998 penny, I felt a wave of strong emotions like I lost control of my emotions for a second. I asked my aunt how my grandma would appear and she said probably glitter, grandma always did lots of crafts and had lots of different colors of glitter. Next day I went into a craft store and right at the front entrance there was a pile of glitter and I felt a wave of childish joy like I wanted to play in the glitter like it was snow, I didn't even know why I felt that way because I was concentrating on finding my items I was shopping for and in a pretty fowl mood except for a few seconds of joy as I saw the glitter. Last night I asked for Depeche Mode or Tears For Fears to play on the radio and as I was turning it to one of my favorite radio channels (I have a few favorite  stations and switch back and forth between the 3) it was playing Tears For Fears (it doesn't play often at all on any radio stations here). Today I asked for a sign from my mom, grandma and guardian angels for a penny, quarter, nickel or dime on the floor in this house (we keep it very tidy) and I found a penny on the floor downstairs. I thought that finding a penny was all a fluke so I asked for the radio to play Depeche Mode, Tears For Fears or George Michael on the radio as a sign from my mom, grandma or guardian angels and seconds later as I turned it on it was playing Tears For Fears. This morning I asked again as a sign from my mom, grandma or guardian angels if the radio could play Tears For Fears, Depeche Mode, or George Michael (they rarely ever play on the local radio stations) and seconds later when I turned the radio on it was playing George Michael. It's seconds after I ask if music from certain artists can play through the radio (that the local radio stations hardly ever play) as a sign from my mom, grandma, or guardian angels that it happens seconds later after I turned on the radio or right as I turned on the radio. Are these a sign from my deceased loved ones?",

The heating pad I am currently using is in good condition. No visible damage and works perfectly fine even after this \"dream\".\n\nAnywho, one night I was already filled with anxiety after having an argument with my significant other. I woke up at midnight and couldn't fall back to sleep until 2am. Once I  finally got back to bed and slept I had a dream (I think) as if I just woke up from dreaming. Like I just woke up from sleeping. \n\nI was being electrocuted. Best way to describe it is what a person might feel when being tased. It was a constant electric shock running through my body. I could barely move. In this dream state I was able to move my left hand and unplug the electric heating pad thinking it would stop this terrible pain. \n\nThen in this dream like state I \"fell back asleep\" only to be woken up by another electric shock coursing through my body. Incapable of moving, opening my eyes, or screaming. My significant other, in this dream, noticed my pain and started to get electrocuted as well. I could see his agony from a birds eye view. \n\nThroughout this whole time I could feel something (a spirit) stand on the right side of the bed closest to me. \n\nI swear I could literally feel the electricity running through my body in real time. It was the most uncomfortable feeling in a dream. I tried googling it but can't find a normal explanation. I'm a healthy woman in my 30s with a history of depression and anxiety. I haven't had a panic attack for 5 years now. \n\nAny advice or explanation would be appreciated.",

Father’s Mother was the reason I distanced myself after some shit she said to me pushed me over the edge\n\nLately, since basically the start of the year I’ve had nightmares and this women with her face keeps appearing threatening me. Tells me shit like “shhh nobody will hear you and nobody will know when your gone, goodnight dearest” “you took my happiness away so i’ll take what remains of you” “tik.tok.tik.tok 2 more”\n\nThe two more I know implies to the fact that a nightmare I had when little is meant to come to be supposedly in two years time where i drive a car off a cliff on accident\n\nI had told that old women about it because I trusted her back then\n\nNow I don’t know what to do, when I wake up I’m either exhausted, terrified, and or in pain as if something had been physically hurting me. When she grabbed my jaw in a nightmare snapping it shut I woke with pain feeling as if my jaw had been squeezed. Another felt as if my insides had been torn out and I wanted to throw up, it felt all loose and thrown about\n\nI may hate her but I never believed she was fully a bad person, just someone that never got treatment for her personal differences since she did have quite a few, so this is surprising. I never have had nightmares about her, it feels like whatever came is here to claim something, or is angry at the fact I’m still alive",

One of the balloons is a number “5” which is my daughter’s age. We believe that these balloons were brought down by our friend, who wasn’t able to be at her 5th birthday party.

First time she saw it was 2022 summer, around late April. I asked if she suffers from high anxiety and she says yeah however… she was facetiming another friend one night and she’s laying on her bed sideways facing the wall/headboard when her friend asked “what’s that behind you?” soooo he saw it too?? which makes me believe that it CANT be sleep paralysis because she said she wasn’t sleeping and one time her mom saw it in the room with her.  she said that the figure is tall and shadow like, also not human but humanoid figures. Apparently it also always appears around the times of 2:35-2:37 AM…odd.

The feeling of dread and danger just completely took over me and I started screaming. My grandma ran to my room and nearly knocked me out with the door. But when she got to me I was still asleep (sleepwalking). But everything was so real, I didn't even know I was asleep I could see my whole room, every detail. \n\nNothing happened for a few months, until one night in the early hours a woman was stood next to my bed with her face very close to mine. I woke up because I got the same feeling of dread and danger, when I saw her I froze in fear and she took a swipe at my face and just before she made contact with me I woke up screaming again. But yet again I thought I was awake at the time. \n\nI've never seen this woman again or felt her presence. But I was wondering if people think this was my imagination and grief playing tricks on me or maybe it was paranormal? Sorry if it doesn't make much sense I tried my best to explain it.",

        "text": "Back story : My fiance’s grandmother has a large collection of antiques because of her late husband. There is a specific clock in question and we accidentally opened SOMETHING up. \n\nA few months ago, his dad was coming home from Japan so the entire family got together to stay at his nana’s cabin. His grandmother and I are both empaths but we kept it between us. Well, everyone got to talking and it turned out that his step-mother, step-sister, and childhood friend were all empaths too. We had an odd feeling about the basement, so everyone went down there and we turned the lights off and sat in a circle holding hands. One by one, we started asking questions. A figure appeared a few minutes in and started walking by the 5 of us. I was possessed at one point and my face changed (per my fiance’s stepmother) as it began talking through me. We caught it all on recording. Afterward, we heard pacing on the top floor and whatever was down in the basement with us started presenting itself as different people that were staying at the cabin. We would hear tapping on the windows and CONCRETE walls as well as see figures outside. Red eyes would appear outside and we would be chased to different areas of the house. Before everyone went home we blessed the cabin with sage and holy oil. As i was placing the holy oil on various parts of the basement, the hand I was touching things with began to burn and turn red. I almost passed out. \n\nThe last time we came up here, my fiance’s stepbrother had me come downstairs to see the crosses that were still on the clock. They’re the ONLY ones left. After we opened the clock, activity picked up again. It feels like a never ending cycle. PLEASE HELP.",

        "text": "Hi, everyone. I’ve had a few “paranormal”experiences in the past (shadow figures, disembodied voices, etc.), but nothing that I  couldn’t find a decent explanation for, like white noise or just my brain trying to find shapes and faces in things. I have a science background, specifically involving the mind and the brain, so I typically find a way to possibly debunk these things for myself. This experience made me sit for a while and I still can’t figure out how to explain it.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I was in the car with my boyfriend as he was driving us home from dinner. As we were approaching our street from within our neighborhood, I saw a little boy on one of the porches. He was dressed in old, early to mid 1900’s attire (“newsboy” hat, long socks, shorts, suspenders, a jacket). He looked to be around 10-12 years old.\n\nI was looking out the windshield near the driver’s side, watching him “place” something down on the porch and start jogging away down the porch’s stairs with a metal carrier thingy in his hand as if he was in a hurry. There was nothing left on the porch. As he ran into the street, I yelled “watch out” because I was scared my bf was going to hit him. My bf replied “For what?” The boy ran alongside the driver side of our car in the opposite direction, locked eyes with me, smiled, and tipped his hat at me.\n\nI was like “Man, that kid was dressed kind of oddly” and my bf replied “What kid?” I looked out the back of the car, and he was gone. Mind you, there is a chunk of fenced forest between this house and the next, so I would have been able to see him after only a few seconds. Plus, I don’t think many kids today tip their hats?\n\nI’m still trying to figure out why my bf did not see the kid. He was RIGHT there, in broad daylight! Mind you, this was not around Halloween, so it doesn’t make sense to me why a child would be dressed in such a manner. That night, I started to realize how FAST this kid was. This was all within the time of passing a house on a neighborhood street, and he was flying down those long stone steps, skipping a few stairs at a time!\n\nI guess I’m just seeing if any of you have any explanations that I might not have thought of. I understand that it’s hard to picture, but this really happened to me and I’m stumped around 6 months later!",

I was so freaked out and my sister came up into my bed for the rest of the night. I remember the next morning looking this up on google and only finding posts saying i was sleep deprived , but i today i just remembered about it and thought i would ask had anyone ever had this happen to them before? i live in ireland so we have no fans, no ac and there was no trains anywhere near my house so nothing physical in my house or room could’ve made this happen,keeping in mind my room was very empty with just the bunk beds in it , my sisters bed and a storage bench. i really thought it could’ve been loose screws in the bed so maybe it started to shake because of that but we took the bunk beds apart last june and it was too well screwed together we had to saw off the side planks to remove them. i really hope someone has had a similar experience to this because this will sit with me and my sister forever.",

It started to play the sound over and over again. My sister heard this to. I got so freaked out I got up grabbed it (nothing was behind it touching it or something) and brought it to my mom waking her. She tried to calm me down with a logical explanation of the batterys being low as its was about 3 years old. Nope. It still worked perfectly fine for 5 YEARS until it was stolen out of my sister backpack. I know it could have been a misfunction or something but it working for 5+ years just fine is jarring.

I (18f) am writing this on behalf of my grandfather (74m) as he is not technologically inclined and couldn’t grasp the concept of Reddit (I’m not sure I can fully lol so please excuse any mishaps). We were recently having a chat over a few drinks and he told us that he believes there is a spirit living in his house. He became a widower in 2020 after loosing my grandma and got quite emotional when speaking about an experience he had about a month ago. He explained that as he was in his bed, he saw a ‘ripple’ on his late wife’s side of the bed, forming the shape of a human figure. He reports it moving towards the foot of the bed to be standing over him, in which it morphed into the shape of a figure, made from black and white tiles (like a harlequin costume), which then disappeared when he ran into the washroom and turned the lights off. He said it was extremely unsettling and it ‘didn’t feel right’ and that he felt it was somehow related to his wife. He has also said that he has had similar experiences in the past with feeling uncomfortable in certain places in rooms, as well as seeing figures at the foot of his bed and is unsure of what to do now. He mentioned going to the local vicar but didn’t want to offend him. I’m not sure what to think of this, being a firm unbeliever in ghosts, but I want to get him any closure and comfort I can find him. It okay s also said that his grandma (my great x2 grandma) had ‘powers’ but I’m not sure of the credibility of this. Can anyone offer any help/support of why this may have happened and what we can do about it? Many thanks.",

        "text": "Alrightyyy! So, I was born and raised in Henderson, NV and eventually moved to Chicago in 2018. I haven’t been back there since. When I was a kid I experienced weird sh*t but I couldn’t get myself to believe in the paranormal. I was annoying and also had a logical explanation for everything. Lo and behold, I became a believer when I moved to Chicago. \n\nI’ve been feeling a bit nostalgic lately and I started to recall the spooky sh*t that happened back in Nevada. If you’re familiar with the town of Henderson then you know where River Mountain is located. Well I lived in that neighborhood, near River Mt. Park. \n\nEveryone’s backyard was the desert and mountains. People would take their four-wheelers into the desert or go set up camp in the mountains. I would always go hiking with my friends after school or on the weekends, and when we were out there all would be quiet. Especially if you go behind the mountains. But we’d hear voices, or people trekking behind us when no one was there. We’d hear whistling or flutes. Sometimes hoofs on the ground. At the time I told myself it’s sounds bouncing off the mountains or being carried by the winds. That’s how annoying I was. \n\nBut I remember this one day. I was home alone playing a video game in my room. The bedroom window was open (there’s a screen in it) so my cat can look out it. While I was playing I heard my neighbor, Tod, whisper outside the window, “Danielle —can you let me in?” \n\nI turned around and no one was outside my window. I went to it thinking that he was ducking under the window, or was standing in the driveway. I looked and didn’t see anyone. I learned later that day that Tod went to the community pool with his family. It spooked me because I didn’t know who was calling to me from the window. I so badly wanted to believe that it was a person and not a ghost, but now I believe it was a spirit. \n\nHere’s something that’s even crazier. The kids in school talked of Skinwalkers, and of mimics. A lot of us experienced hearing our family calling to us when they’re not around, or seeing our friends doppelgängers. Animals were being abducted from backyards and found mutilated in the area. Like weird shit went on when I was a kid and I was oblivious to it all. \n\nI reached out to my childhood friends and asked if they recalled anything spooky, and they do. Lately I’ve been thinking about writing about those experiences and putting them on my blog. \n\nIs there anyone here who’s from the southwest that has experienced anything spooky?",

        "text": "Hello, my name’s Kal. I’m no stranger to the paranormal, but all the ghost stuff usually happened when I was with my friend—she had a spirit attached to her. So, I wasn’t expecting anything ghost-related to happen to me.\n\nWell, back in 2018, I was living in this shared house where you rented a room. The house had four levels, I and one other stayed on the very bottom of the home. From my understanding, no one else experienced anything paranormal, and this was the only time I had a run-in with a spirit while living there.\n\nTo quickly explain the layout of my room; it was square shaped, and when you first walked in, to your left was the closet—which was along the same wall at the door. I had my bed up against the opposite wall of the closet. I had other bits of furniture strewn out, but that’s where my bed was located—the furthest point away from the door, this is important to the story.\n\nAnyway, I was heavily depressed, so I would remain in my room most days—only coming out when I took a shower, or was cooking food. It was around 3pm, maybe earlier, I can’t quite remember. I had just woken up from a nap and had my back facing the rest of the room—I was looking at the wall, doing my usual brooding when I woke up from a nap.\n\nSuddenly, I felt something push down on my bed. Like, fully but slowly pushed down. It was enough for my body to shift, which made me roll over to see who the hell was in my bedroom. But… there was no one there. I remember looking down at where, I assumed, the bed was pushed down, and there on the sheets were two indentations of hands. I remember staring at them, not fully computing what I was looking at.\n\nOnce I realize what I was looking at, I *freaked* out and scrambled off of my bed. The logical side of my brain was telling me someone was pulling a prank, so I went to check outside of my room—we had a little space where our bathroom, fridge, and some other pieces of furniture were located. I thought that maybe if a person had done this, they ran out of my room in the few milliseconds it took for me to roll over. \n\nI wasn’t sure how, I mean, I was the furthest point away from the door. Not to mention, the floor was that cheap, fake wood that makes a lot of sound when you walk on it. Anyway, while I was trying to find an explanation for how a human could physically leave the room, I went to turn my door knob, only to notice it was locked.\n\nI then thought that maybe they were in my closet. So I checked it, but again, nothing. I was absolutely baffled, I think I just didn’t want to accept that something paranormal was behind this. I tried to think of every logical explanation for what could’ve done this, but nothing made sense.\n\nI know for a fact I wasn’t still asleep, nor was I in that in-between state of waking up and still being asleep, so couldn’t have been dreaming. Nothing fell on my bed, there was nothing on the floor when I went to check outside of my room. Not to\nMention, what caused the hand indentations? Nothing I thought of made sense, other than this being yet another paranormal experience—something I thought I had escaped when my best friend and I moved to separate cities.\n\nEventually, I just accepted that whatever attached itself to her was now with me. But nothing like that ever happened again. I lived there for another few years without any incident. I still have no logical explanation for that, and I’ll never forget it.",

It was pitch black out and we said we were going to bed so we put on American dad and both got ready for bed then all of a sudden we heard a knock/squeaky noise on the window so I jumped up and moved the curtain and k was standing behind me we saw a black clothed figure with a hood on sitting on the couch facing the woods, so k and I ran out my bedroom door and right out the back door leading on the porch and we saw nothing then we went back inside got shoes and flashlights and searched all around house and there was nothing. After we settle back down we both lay back in bed and put on American dad and about 15 mins past and the hair dryer that was unplugged turned on and I hoped out of bed and it was plugged in so I unplugged it and we were finally able to go to bed.",

        "text": "Recently I started to experience horrible pain in my abdomen. I don't do doctors or hospitals so my plan was to ride it out. A week passed and the pain just got worse. It was the worst pain of my life. Being a former fighter and working as plumber I was very familiar and tolerant of pain. My lifestyle and pain go hand in hand.  However this pain was crippling. My families concern and nagging forced me to go to the ER. I was put in a bed in a hallway while they took my blood and ran tests. I went and had a CT scan and was placed back in the hall. I was told my appendix ruptured and basically I was on the verge of dying. A man named Robert who I assumed was a nurse was caring for me. I thought at the time he was giving me extra attention and didn't leave my side. For a busy hospital where I was stuck in a hallway I found this odd. He seemed troubled and worried yet he was very calm and gentle with me. His care was amazing and was very surprising. All the stories I had heard of hospitals and how understaffed they were Robert seemed to be only caring for me. He came over to me one last time and said \" It's time we part ways. You are off to the OR\". I panicked because my biggest fear was being cut open. Robert placed his hand on my chest and said \" Don't worry. It is not your time\". I was wheeled off and that was that. After  being released from the hospital I was sent home with a folder of information.  There was a letter with a phone number to call if you had concerns or ideas on ways the hospital should improve. I decided I would call and give a positive review, especially for Robert.  The only name I remembered was his and I had hoped they kept record of the staff caring for me. I told the woman that answered about my experience and told her Robert was exceptional and his name was the only one I knew. She sounded puzzled. She told me there was no Robert on their staff. I said well maybe I got his name wrong. I described what he looked like to her. She said their was no one with that description and I only had a female staff caring for me other than the surgeon. \n My mind is blown. I have no explanation for it other than a bad reaction to morphine.",

        "text": "So not sure if this was a paranormal experience or if I was getting trolled. This happened about 10 years ago. Me and a few friends came back from a party but we didn't want the night to end. So one friend suggested cruising to a canyon called Turnbull canyon. It was about 2am. As I'm going towards one of the peaks in the canyon, there are warning signs to be careful of icy roads because it's cold and it's common for ice to form at those altitudes.  \n\nThere are 3 others in my car. I found it funny they didn't want the night to end, and suggested going here, but they all fell asleep. Besides one friend who would doze in and out. As I got higher and higher, I noticed 3 people walking down. My first reaction was, why are there people walking this far away at this time, and it was very cold. Also it's a long way down to walk. When I got closer, those 3 people were just looking straight and their eyes were pure white. All 3 had on the same clothes which was something like a bib overall. I immediately got shook for a bit when I saw that.\n\nTold one of my friends and he didn't get a good look but he saw the 3 figures. We decided to get the hell out of there. But to get back down meant I have to go back to where I was coming from. Which means I'll encounter those 3 dudes again.  As I went back down, they were nowhere to be seen. There's nowhere else to turn into or anything, and it's a long walk down. I always wondered if those 3 individuals were just rolling their eyes back and trying to scare me. But it didn't make sense how they just vanished",

The ride home was fine until I reached this certain part of the road where the left side's view is just the open sky, mountains surrounding the town and a view of the sea. Staring at the blue sky, I saw a man hovering in thin air. He wasn't flying or anything. Just that creepy exorcist position where the person is lifted in the air and their body is stiff. I didn't get my eyes off it. I thought maybe it was just my eyes seeing things that weren't there and waiting until my eye focused and it'll just be something I made a different image in my mind but it didn't. It was still a man hovering in thin air. When a trunk of a tall tree covered my view, it was gone.\n\nI still don't know how to explain it. I don't know if it was a ghost of some sort or whatever but I know what I saw. I've never hallucinated so it creeps me out even more.",

        "text": "I moved into my apartment approximately 9 years ago. It was a factory that had been converted into lofts in the early 2000s. I felt compelled to make this post because there's been some limited and strange experiences I've had over the years that led me down the rabbit hole and made me aware of an unsolved murder that had occured on the property in 1998. I'm just wondering if this lines up with any other experiences out there.\n\nShortly after I moved in, I was living on my own and had an experience where I had fallen asleep infront of the tv and when i woke up and got up from the couch, I stepped into a thick puddle of liquid that was not there when I fell asleep. The puddle was probably 30 centimeters in diameter. There was no obvious explanation in terms of air ducts, underlying pipework, and i didn't have any liquids i was drinking that could have fallen over. The liquid was not water, it was thick, viscous and smelled like coconuts, almost like a shampoo. I just cleaned it up, called my parents to see if there could be an explanation and they said to just monitor, but it could've been a leak elsewhere that moved there. I never experienced anything like this again, but the experience led me to searching online for answers.\n\nOnline when I searched for explanations of liquid appearing it gave me normal answers, but also led me to discussions about poltergeists. To discount it i basically rationalized that there usually had to be some sort of trauma and so unless something bad happened on the property i could likely discount the theory. I can't say i was a true skeptic, but i am definitely someone who would rather not poke and find things I would rather not find. \n\nLong story short, i discovered that my building was previously a factory and that in 1998 the owner was murdered in the parking lot. The case is still unsolved, although a police officer was quoted in the news as saying they know who did it, but there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute.\n\nWhen i had discovered this i kinda of made the link and simply mentioned the story to people in the building and friends and mentioned about the strange liquid appearing.  I chalked it up to this murdered soul trying to get some acknowledgement and ever since I've been telling the story i haven't had another physical experience, but recently I'm starting to sense I've been getting other experiences.\n\nFor the past year, whenever i work in my home office where i sit right at the window closest to the street, I've been having a recurring kind of feeling or sense of getting shot by gun in the head, or at least what i imagine it would feel like to get shot. I get this feeling when I'm awake, they aren't dreams, it's like my mind drifts to it. It's hard to explain, it's like this memory of a car coming by and I feel my head clock back violently. This has been a recurring kind of memory or irrational fear that comes and goes, but it's been happening for like a year and only when it's dark outside. I think this might be the spirit trying to communicate how they felt when they got murdered.\n\nWhen i first researched the murder i didn't pay attention to where the victim was shot, but I just went back to review the news articles and they mention it was an organized mob hit with a getaway car, and three men who shot the victim once in the head and twice in the stomach. I just made the link between the recurring memory and the shot to the head. The murder happened at 7 in the morning and my stomach tends to randomly hurt at that time for like 30 minutes and then completely fine the rest of the day. This isn't every day, but here or there.\n\nHas anyone had any similar experiences? Is there anything i could do to put the spirit at ease?\n\nI can provide news article proof to mods, but don't want to publically release all the info for privacy reasons.",

        "text": "So to start of with my house is a new build that no one has lived in before me. The land it's built on used to be old factories and before that it was farm land. Also sorry for the long post but this has been going on for a while now.\n\nWhen we got the keys to the house we went in and the house was completely empty (no furniture or carpets just concrete flooring). 2 days later we opened up the house to let the work men in, in every room of the house there was a blue feather. I never understood how they managed to get into every single room without someone physically putting them there, but I had the only set of keys so no one else had access to the house. \n\nAfter about 2 months of living in the house we started noticing footsteps upstairs, things moving around, my washing machine would randomly turn on and things would be thrown across the room and break. I managed to ignore most of this, but things started slowly progressing. I was sleeping in the spare room because I was up for work early, I would always feel like someone was watching me, in the middle of the night the cover would slowly start to be pulled of me. I've also been sat awake reading and felt a burning on my chest and when I've looked there's been a huge red scratch across my chest. We had a guest sleep in the spare room and she woke in the middle of the night and could see the shadow of someone stood outside the door, she thought it was me walking around checking on the children but I hadn't got out of bed that day. Since this started the walking around upstairs has become daily, loud bangs come from the bedrooms asif someone was jumping of the bed onto the floor. \n\nThe worst experience I've had in the house was when I was getting my daughter dressed after her bath. We was sat on her floor and from the corner of my eye I saw someone walk straight past the door and into the guest room. I thought it was my partner so I started shouting to him and when I got no answer I got up to check and he wasn't even home. But I know I saw someone walk past, for the first time I really felt scared.\n\nMy two year old keeps waking up crying saying she's scared of the man in her room, but she also points to the guest bedroom and says the man is scary so I have to keep the door closed at all times.\n\nI don't know if my imagination is just going wild or if there is maybe a spirit trapped in our house. What should I do?",

        "text": "So yesterday my mum told me a story about something that had happened to her at work. My mum has always been a huge skeptic, as I have been myself, but this has properly freaked us both out as we can’t explain it. I’m curious to see what others think.\n\nMy mum works at a pharmacy as a dispenser, she has a colleague that she talks to every day who is also a skeptic but has an interest in the paranormal. She told my mum a story about how she went to visit a graveyard to visit a loved one with one of her friends, they were the only ones in the graveyard but they heard a female humming.  They assumed it was someone crouching behind a grave tending to it and had a look round, they eventually came to a grave where the sound appeared to be coming from but nobody was there. They checked their phones and any other devices and nothing. A little freaked out they went to the pub nearby and had some food, as they were chatting they both went silent at the same time and froze as they could hear the humming again. They carried on eating and eventually parted to go home. \n\nLater that night my mums colleague got a call from her friend who was hysterical. She cried down the phone that she’d heard the humming in her house. Mums colleague calmed her down and reassured her that it was nothing and she was probably just hearing things, after putting the phone down she went upstairs to bed as it was late, she heard the humming in her bedroom.\n\nMy mum upon being told this wasn’t that amazed as she just brushed it off as a story, being the skeptic she is. She left the room and walked down the long hallway leading to the top of the stairs, she says she heard a female humming right behind her, different notes but only lasting 2/3 seconds. She turned around to laugh at her colleague thinking she was taking the mick, nobody was there. Her colleague was still in the room on the other end of the hallway (too far away to be heard) and nobody else was on that floor with them. There’s no PA system or any kinds of speakers and she didn’t have her phone or anything on her. \n\nI’ve never seen my mum so freaked out before as she’s a very strait laced person and always tries to debunk everything paranormal. I can’t think of anything either. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "So. \n\nMe and my friend Cas decided to go on a drive about an hour ago because there was a spot I'd been looking at going to at night because it was secluded and a good spot to smoke in general. Around when we started talking about it he noted that he started smelling something sweet, cherries, and a hint of cigar. \n\nI was familiar with this entity as it's been around my room since I moved in back in 2020. It's not a menevolent entity and is actually quite kind, Cas stated that it felt like he'd been hugged and just overall felt comfort with the entity around.\n\nSo we go on the drive and we're talking and all and we turn down the last road until the destination when I saw a tree down in the road. It didn't block the road completely but it was too narrow of a gap for my car to fit. Well, I knew a backroad that led to the same destination so we turned around and headed down that way. \n\nIt was a very wooded backroad; no service, very few houses for miles and surrounded by trees. It was the type of road to only have one lane because of how unused it is. As I'm driving we're talking and we pass over a bridge. I point it out as a spot I wanted to take him another time since it's just a neat area. Not long after we passed it, he said \"Did you see that?\"\n\nIt's a very curvy road so I initially assumed it was an animal as I hadn't seen anything. I asked what he saw and he said \"It looked like something that crossed the road.\" Immediately I got an intense feeling of dread. I asked if he felt it too and he confirmed that he did so I stopped the car, took a moment and immediately said \"We're not supposed to be here.\"\n\nHe agreed and I turned around, heading back to where we just came. The dread got more intense but after we crossed the bridge it eased but was still there. I stated that whatever it was isn't allowed to follow us home and it wasn't allowed on my property. It started to disappear and we kept seeing things along the road like shadows.\n\nAs I was driving to the main road a white truck pulled up very fast to a stop sign on a side road almost as if out of thin air and pulled out behind us.  I didn't take much note of it until I looked in my rearview and saw it tailing the hell out of us. I pointed it out and Cas said he didn't like the feeling he got from the truck. \n\nWe got to the stop sign that lead out to the main road an I purposefully didn't turn my blinker on in case it was following us, but the truck did and it was turning the same way as us. After I made the turn I waited a few moments before looking back in the rearview and it was gone. It disappeared into thin air. The drive home was silent and Cas waited until we got back to talk about things he knew and should've thought of before we even got in the car. \n\nI was telling the story to a friend over Discord and asked Cas to describe the thing he saw in the road, asking if it walked on two legs or four. He said: \"It didn't have legs.\"  \nIt was brown and looked like a head that just crossed the road. Asking him about it now he said that it was tall, taller than the doorframe of my closet and he saw it from a distance so he didn't know what its body looked like. I asked if it could've been a bat and he emphasized that it couldn't have been. \n\nDuring the drive home we both noted that it felt like there was a hand on each of our shoulders. He pointed out the log in the road could've been a sign not to go, as well as the friendly entity that appeared in my room beforehand. \n\nI'm thinking it's a certain W-word entity (names hold power and I will not refer to it by name.)",

My body instantly went cold and I immediately got grabbed my friend and pushed her into her room and closed the door and told her what I saw. We searched it up but the results were inconclusive, we left her laptop open and went into the kitchen and were goofing off again when we hear her front door open and close and something fell off the kitchen counter, her dog used to open her front door like that. When we got scared and ran back to her room a completely new page was open on her laptop and I know it wasn’ my friends doing because I exited her room last. The page it was on was on a forum and it was about ghost encounters.\n\n The shit still kind of scares me now and I’m having memories from that night while writing this, I haven’t been to her dads place since and don’t plan to.",

        "text": "So, I’ve mentioned in a previous post that I’ve had several paranormal/ creepy encounters. This was one of them.\n\nContext; I was living in a two- story house, and my room was pretty big, I had a window on the left of my bed (which was in the center of the room) with pink curtains over the window. In front of my bed there was a large empty space with a chest of toys, where I would play. \n\nIt was night (again) and this time my mom put me to bed because my dad was on a business trip. Because I was 8 I fell asleep almost immediately and woke up around 5 or 6 o’clock in the morning. I saw my dad walk into the room, he opened my curtains and the room filled with light. I then saw my brother on the floor in front of my bed playing with his train set, at least it looked like my brother. My dad was still facing the curtains. I said “Hi dad” but he didn’t answer, the curtains swung shut and he and my brother just vanished. I lay in bed scared then after making sure I wasn’t dreaming I got up and touched the curtains. They weren’t completely drawn as they had been before “dad” walked in. However when I looked at the floor the train set was gone. The scary thing is when the curtains opened I actually saw the light from outside. Somehow I managed to go back to sleep.",

        "text": "I've seen this case documented on Haunted Hospitals and stumbled across it again. Apparently some guy was treated at a hospital for a football related injury, he woke up at night, fully conscious and alert, eg, was even able to use the elevator, but the hospital was deserted, in shambles and all the electronic devices didn't work, eg, TV. After the sheer panic he went back to sleep and awoke back to reality where everything was normal.\n\nWas this guy dead? Was he actually a disembodied spirit or ghost roaming in another realm or dimension? If this is what ghosts actually experience---isolation, angst, powerlessness and sadness---it must be a miserable existence.",
