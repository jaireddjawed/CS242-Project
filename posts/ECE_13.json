I intend to locate the fault in this speaker system and repair it. If you are familiar with this model, you may already have seen [this guy's page](http://www.thompdale.com/bash_amplifier/New_2-1/New_2-1_bash_amp.htm) where he reverse engineered the entire thing to make schematics. \n\nThe system I am troubleshooting is unresponsive and I don't have details on how it operated before failure since it was given to me. \n\nSince the entire speaker seems unresponsive, I am making the assumption that the power supply circuit is the best place to start troubleshooting. \n\n\n\nI feel like as a 4th year EE student I should be able to do some kind of analysis on this circuit to calculate expected node voltages or branch currents. But to be honest I'm not sure how to account for most of the components doing either nodal or mesh. \n\n[Schematic](http://www.thompdale.com/bash_amplifier/New_2-1/2-1_power_supply_schematic-986x707.gif)\n\n* LF1 - Line Filter ?\n* BR1 - Full Rectifier - How do I tackle the DC and AC before and after BR1 ? \n* C2, C1, C4, C7 - Do I model these as open in DC or do I have to take into account their affect on the ripple from BR1? \n* Any Q* transistor. Do I model these as dependent sources? \n* Any D* diode. Do I just count it's voltage drop and keep track of the waveform? \n* U1 - Look on data sheet for pin voltages? My only guess. \n* T1:2, T1:1 - Not sure what to do with these guys. \n\nI'm sure after I can make an equation for everything from the input to T1:2, T1:1 I should be able to solve the bottom LF and HF circuits since it's just more of the same thing. \n\nI'm well aware that solving equations on the circuit schematics might not be necessary to fix the speakers. However, I think this would still be a good exercise for me since clearly I need some review. Having a physical project to work on will motivate me to stay focused on reviewing the material instead of getting distracted on something else a few days from now. \n\n\nAny help or nudges in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. \n",

        "text": "Edit: Notice how I said graduating BSEEs guys. As in recent grads. MSEEs and BSEEs in particular, though I wouldn't preclude PhDs either. If you're a 15 year Principal engineer or a senior member of technical staff who just made the next generation compound heterostructure ultra wide band gap op amp that will revolutionize RF as we know it, and was at Texas Instruments all 15 years, yeah I don't think some random portfolio site with your arduino projects will really be looked at. Come on guys, use some common sense.\n\nOriginal:\n\nThese are some personal sites for electrical engineers currently in the industry that serve as great examples for good personal portfolios for EEs. They range in design and features.\n\nThis should give graduating BSEEs some kind of an idea what they might make a personal portfolio site to be like. For context, I've had a friend who ended up working at ADI after showing an existing ADI engineer some of his IC designs on his personal website. Scored him the interview, which got him the job. We as EEs should definitely keep up with the times imo.\n\nI find it's helpful to have references to other people explicitly in your field and not something broad like over all portfolio sites or even engineering portfolio sites either.\n\nNow these four people are rather exceptional, and to those who are aspiring computer architects should give you an idea just how difficult it is to enter computer architecture these days directly. The most \"easy\" way would be to enter as VLSI verification engineer, eventually graduate to a design engineer, and hope you can somehow become a full architect after a decade, though even that is questionable imo.\n\nNow for the sites:\n\n* [http://jaewoong.org/](http://jaewoong.org/)\n* [https://zhehaomao.com/](https://zhehaomao.com/)\n* [http://www.danzhang.net/](http://www.danzhang.net/)\n\nBonus is [http://www.edgrochowski.com/software-museum/elang.html](http://www.edgrochowski.com/software-museum/elang.html) who's been a computer architect at Intel for many decades. Very cool dude, architects are really exceptional people, this being just one example.",

        "text": "I have been out of undergrad for about 3 years. I got my BSEE and went to work for a defense contractor across the country doing test engineering which was more or less tester hand was holding. Unhappy with my situation I decided that I would apply to jobs closer to family and friends. I ended up getting a job at a research lab still doing defense work for the past 2 years. I went all in got my MSECE part-time which my current employer paid for. On paper (other than my commute) my employer is great to work for. Relatively relaxed work environment for the defense industry, great pay, benefits, consistent raises, endless amounts of “cool” interesting projects and the ability to work on whatever interests me. This all sounds great but recently I’m at a lull with my current role I keep getting feelings that the “grass is greener”. Most of what I do is systems analysis and some light coding, mainly MATLAB and C/C++. I work with a lot of intelligent people who work on “sexy” buzzword topics which sound super exciting on the surface but when I think about trying to get involved I realize that I probably don’t have enough experience or deeper interest in the topics. When I think about if this is what I want to do for the rest of my life I arrive at the answer of probably not. I decided to study engineering because I was good at math, science and engineers get paid relatively well. Sometimes I think about alternative career paths which vary from sales engineering, field engineering, consulting, construction, business, manufacturing, electrician, welder, farmer, cattle rancher, patent lawyer, real estate and being self-employed doing something. Obviously those are a wide variety of career paths but I think that I have narrowed my source of contempt down to being inside at a computer all day, lack of human interaction with exciting people, lack of true passion for what I am working on, being on a faced paced dynamic exciting team, physical exertion, and feeling that I’m just a cog in a machine at times. I enjoy being outside, trying to understand a problem, and working with my hands and accomplishing something. I’m tired of making slight iterations on something only to find out that and the ICD changed and the same work needs to be done for the next go around. Maybe I actually do like engineering but I need to leave the defense industry or work for a smaller company? Is my current role causing me to questions other careers or am I truly unhappy and should look into pursuing something else?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/95sln2/question_on_bootloaders_compilers_and_basic_os/",
        "text": "Hey so there's always been some questions I've had with the basic design of a processor. \n\nLet's say I had an existing processor. It included some main memory, a processor, and a bus interface and something like UART. \n\nI want to then take that processor and run an assembler on it. Like load an assembler program onto the processor to then run it via terminal.\n\nBasically I want a way to connect to my processor and run some programs on it. \n\nWhy? Say I write some RTL for a fancy function, like uhh I don't know natural log and higher precision division. I just made some huge changes to my floating point unit and I want to test them out. But instead of testing them out like most architecture students, by hand loading the values into the boot memory of the FPGA like a barbarian, I'd like to program it. \n\nSo to do this I believe I would need:\n\n- A working two pass assembler on my host machine that will cross assemble for my target architecture \n- A uart driver written in assembly\n- A bootloader\n- A text editor program\n- An assembler. Literally one written for my processor. \n- Some other shit I'm really not sure of. \n- A file system\n- Some way to run or load code in place, like after assembly, store the instructions into memory to run. Aka a linker and loader, I need parts of a tool chain. \n\nI connect through some serial terminal program. I use the terminal text editor I wrote on my processor. I save and exit. Run assembler.exe on the program. run program. have program run. \n\nI'm guessing to execute all this I would need a very basic OS with a file system and a simple kernel, a two pass cross assembler, a two pass regular assembler, linker and a loader. And some programs to dump data back through the UART link? \n\nAnyone have some project links into similar things? Like usually all this stuff delves into using GCC or some GCC-lite variant, or just focus on their on entire projects, even the design of a simple first stage bootloader. \n\nIs there some integrated project that might discuss these details without being some tome in size? \n\nI think Project Oberon is the only project I can think to that is similar to this. \n\nTowards actualizing it in hardware, say I had an FPGA. It usually has some block ram or some onboard SRAM in it, otherwise I'd have to use some EEPROM like device. Probably an SD Card. So in reality into my processor bus I'd have to attach an SD card controller using SPI. And I have to have assembled programs in the kernel for SPI handling and SD card control, if I didn't have some built in microcode OR through a dedicated FSM which sounds annoying literally built into hardware. \n\nSo my processor would need to be similar to:\n\n- Processor\n- Cache Memory and Cache Memory Controller (On or offboard SRAM)\n- External SDRAM controller acting as main memory if I wrote it or a DDRX class controller if I used a Hardmemory IP block from my FPGA vendor\n- UART Controller\n- SPI Controller\n- SD Card Controller (if not done through firmware) \n- Bus Interface\n- Interrupt Handler if not done through polling. Thankfully no DMA, phew. I know how DMA works, and use it semi regularly with uCons but I can't develop the RTL if my life depended on it, probably. \n\nThankfully using UART I don't need to worry about doing some memory mapped IO which is convenient I guess. I mean technically I do for UART, however it's not like I need to do it for a VGA controller, keyboard and mouse, which would make things a touch more complicated. \n\nHow in the name of fuck do you write an assembler? Like yeah I get it, to really test out your compiler you have to compile your compiler. What does that mean though. Yeah bootstrapping, yeah C was in B. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THO? \n\nI'm an EE student who's taken a bajillion embedded and architecture courses, however I've only ever gone up to Data Structures and Algorithms in CS. What the fuck, how do you assemble an assembler. Never taken OS or compilers or Systems Programming or any of that fancy shit. I can use a toolchain. I've used cross compilers. But how do you make one? \n\nLike seriously I don't get it. Do I make a file storage system, store a file with my instructions which are now ascii binary representations. Then they have to fetch sequentially from the file and process each thing? What does that mean????? I know assembly instructions like load word store word or FMULV or some shit. WHAT EVEN IS THIS? Assemble an assembler. HOW? I understand reading JEDEC specs for DDR memory to implement RTL, but I have no fucking clue how this CS shit works. How do you make a toolchain? What even is any of this shit? \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I watch a ton of vintage computing shit. I've literally watched people program shit with a teletype into basic for fun. that doesn't mean I understand it. [I WATCHED A FUCKING PUNCH CARD LOAD DATA, BUT I DON'T GET IT. WHAT EVEN IS THIS????????????????????????? Man if they made a basic interpreter in basic and loaded that in by paper tape I'd basically shit myself.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB3mwSROoJ4KLWM8KwK0cD1dhX35wILBj) \n\nI'm literally watching a whole channel dedicated to the altair 8800. And you'd think I'd understand this shit by now. After reading Hennessy and Patterson (and Patterson and Hennessy). After taking 3 courses in VLSI and Digital IC design. After all this time I can make a processor, even down to modern device physics and fabrication. I can choose between static logic vs domino logic. I can tell you why we use high k dielectrics or SOI technology. I can explain why we have to switch to static logic vs like NORA under the constraints of short channel effect. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM A LINKER IN ASSEMBLY. HOW DO YOU PROGRAM AN ASSEMBLER IN ASSEMBLY? WHAT IS THIS FUCKING MAGIC??? People think Signal Integrity is black magic, man this shit is basic EM. But what the unholy fuck is this chicken and egg bullshit. I don't get bootstrapping, i really don't. ",

You can supply the customer with the documentation - but it so often doesn't remain with it.\n\nIn the (recent) past - it wasn't unusual to at least find a paper copy of the circuit diagram \"under the lid\" - but space is limited, as products become ever smaller.\n\nWhat I was thinking of is an electrically isolated ROM on the board, with some standard interface. As much documentation, circuit diagrams, even annotated software listings, setting up and calibration instructions, parts lists - everything could be on it. Even a failsafe copy of the system ROM, in compressed form.\n\nBarring physical damage to the \"documentation\" ROM itself - it would survive almost any faults. \n\nPossibly not for consumer products, where a failed unit = another potential sale. But for low volume bespoke electronics, designed and built for a particular purpose?\n\nIt would need to be standardised, so that it could be looked for and found and the information stored accessed.  Otherwise, the documentation for accessing it would need to be stored on a ROM...\n\nAt present I put the documentation online, with a QR code on the enclosure. But websites come and go. \n\nWhat do you reckon? Would self-documenting hardware become as useful as self-documenting code?",

I guess this is a bit of a rant as well.\n\n**Background**: I'm about 2 years into a PD/PnR position doing things from synthesis to verification, I lucked my way into an internship and into full time with only a bachelors at a small recruiting company dealing with contracting and turnkey projects. I've run through about 2-3 projects at the moment, and had some slight involvement in others. Issue is, my mentor/boss that hired me has left, as well as a few others. The management that is left is rather business oriented. E.g. we were delayed essential tool licenses for two weeks, and had to steal them from another team working tape-out.\n\nLong story short: I'm not happy here. Shafted pay, poor management, no benefits, lack of mentorship, lack of job security quite honestly. I'm here out of necessity, in finance and the need for experience.\n\n**My concern right now is, where should my career be headed?**\n\nRight now, even though I'm working and learning, the actual learning seems to be crawling down to a halt. There's still a lot I'm aware I need to learn, but there's very little resources where I am to do so. I'm biding my way, but I fear that I'll build bad habits, or learn improperly, or just never develop as fast as I need to move on.\n\nFrom what I can tell, PD is a very niche line of work. Starting in the last two months, I've already applied to what hand-full I can even come close to qualifying for across the entire US, including those that require at least a masters. I haven't really received a response from anyone. I don't know if it's my resume, my lack of experience, or lack of a graduate degree, but it's really disheartening. Not to mention, it seems like PD work is being farmed out to Asia quite often, I don't see any prospects in continuing.\n\nI've also tried applying to front-end as well, I did an FPGA senior project, which is as far as my experience extends, hoping to land an entry-level ASIC/FPGA interview, but nothing back so far. It's extremely disheartening because it seems like I really need at least a masters, which is something I cannot afford to do at the moment. It just seems like my experience isn't worth anything in a transition, or maybe companies just don't want someone like that.\n\nI don't know. I'm considering maybe trying to transition to software. I don't hate PD work. I don't love it, it's something I can definitely do. I'm realizing the job is about the people. But the prospects look grim from my perspective. I don't know what to do, how to feel, really anything.\n\n\n\n",

A lightning storm fried the motherboard (the usual suspects of power supply and RAM were swapped out but it wouldn't boot) so we decided it was beyond practical repair and replaced it.\n\nI was unable to bring myself to junk it though, because of that display. I has a project where it would be useful, so I kept it around.\n\nToday I disassembled the full rig, hoping that it would be as simple as an HDMI header, a USB connection for the touchscreen, and a power connector, all running to the display. No such luck. Instead, there is a broad ribbon connector running to a break out board, a tiny ribbon connector running to something I had already disassembled prior to noticing that it ran to the display, and a series of 3 tiny headers on 3 of the corners of the display that also appear to run to that break out board.\n\nThe break out board is a custom HP part with lots of custom headers on it. It has HDMI in (that ran to the motherboard), an SD card slot, the WiFi chip and antenna, etc etc.\n\nThe simple hack of trying to use the break out board as the display  controller looks way more complex and fraught with peril than it is worth.\n\nBUT...\n\nThe display itself is an LG part number. That tells me that there are LG engineering specs that describe how to connect the display. And almost certainly there is a board out there somewhere for where this display was used as a stand-alone monitor, that has the ribbon cables and the touchscreen headers on one side, and power, USB, and HDMI on the other. Odds are that the display connections are standardized, and there are dozens if not hundreds of potential controller boards out there that will work.\n\nHow would I go about tracking down one of these boards?\n\nThanks",

For digital you'd use something different but even then there is seldom \"end-to-end\" simulation possible or used. At a circuit level, you simulate a small case and extrapolate.\\*\"\n\nI've only ever used Spice to pick out a part of a circuit whose behavior I couldn't determine analytically, and simulate it every which way.  Usually this is either a switching power supply or a class D amplifier (or a switching motor drive, if your semantics can't stretch \"class D amplifier\" to encompass that).  I've always used LTSpice for that, because I believe their mantra about it being better at simulating switching circuits.\n\nI can't imagine wanting to take a schematic for a whole board and simulating it just on the grounds of simulation speed, much less accuracy.\n\nSo, if you're using KiCad or OrCad, or Protel or whatever-CAD as your front-end to Spice, \\*do\\* you try to simulate whole schematics?  Or are you just using the familiar front-end to do selected scraps of circuits, the way I do with LTSpice?",

The laydown is this; a battery powered device meant for long term deployment using something on the order of 70 nanowatts when idle has no good battery health monitoring. If a battery fails prematurely or is encountering unexpected draw, the software will be oblivious, continuing to derate the battery percentage based on an estimate of use/battery capacity. I’m not interested in reading voltages, I just want to know when the series voltage of the batteries falls below 7V.  \n\nTrying to find a set up where there is only power used when triggering. ",
