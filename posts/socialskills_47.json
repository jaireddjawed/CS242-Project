But the issue I'm running into is that it's always such a struggle to get him to hang out in person, and he acts like making plans is some kind of burden on him. It's always one of the same few reasons. A) He's too \"broke\" to go out, even though he has a six-figure job he constantly brags about while I am currently unemployed and stuck in low-paying jobs; B) he's too tired to go out because he spends so much time with his friends from this hobby he has; C) he's too tired from work, or wants to work on a Friday night; D) the place I suggest going to is too far or hard to get to; E) anything after 8 PM is so late and he doesn't want to be out that long. I feel like I have to coax him to do literally anything in real life, and then when I do he often  leaves early. \n\nI'm really annoyed by this. The thing is, I'm pretty sure this isn't one of those situations where he's trying to ditch me and slowly let the friendship go. I think he literally is just like this. But I can't stand that he apparently has all this time, energy, and money for this group of people from his hobby (he's told me they're his primary friend group now), but acts like any attempt to make plans with him is disturbing his valuable alone time. Should I just cut him off? I'm feeling kind of spiteful lately and really just want to stick it to someone.",

It usually results in the other person being confused and asking me to clarify, causing me to say “Oh yeah no I meant x”. For example: I’d talk about something that happened in a uni subject but say it happened in the wrong one, when I (and the person I was talking to) know that doesn’t match the context.\n\nOther times I will fumble on the start of a sentence, needing to restart multiple times before actually saying what I meant to say.\n\nFurthermore, I also sometimes misjudge when to talk and end up accidentally talking over someone, interrupting them. I know this is really rude and feel embarrassed each time I do it.\n\nThese three problems happen quite a lot during my conversations and I feel embarrassed by it since it makes me look stupid. I’ve not got any mental conditions causing it and can talk normally on text conversations. It just feels like I get heated when in a conversation and make mistakes like these.

For the first few years of our friendship, we were going to school together and worked at some of the same places and spent a lot of time together on a day-to-day basis and would go out together frequently. One of the reasons we hit it off is we both grew up in extremely dysfunctional households and while our individual traumas were different, we shared a similar background. Now, for a good portion of our friendship since then we’ve been long distance friends. I really care about this person and enjoy texting with her and want to keep her in my life, but increasingly feel uncertain because I really don’t enjoy seeing her in person. I could never tell her this, but I feel really drained anytime we spend time together. We took a day trip a few years ago and I had an awful time and felt exhausted.

I've tried asking before if I did anything wrong, but usually they either don't answer the question or just blow up in anger (and still don't answer), so clearly that's not the way to go, and when they do get angry I often try to apologize, but that seems to just piss them off even more?

Why are we not able to get a conversation going ? I am also asking because, while it doesn't happen a lot, it isn't the first time I have experienced this with some people. What could I do in such occasions ?\n\nThanks in advance !",

My friend used to be a social butterfly, and I'm a complete anti-social nerd who don't really like to talk because I'm just too depressed for people to approach me. I keep on having this unexplainable fears that my friend will leave me for his other friends. And it's not helping that he keep saying to me that he wishes for a friend who is a man (i'm a woman). My friend also have pretty much this same issue as me but I don't care about gender in friendships but he does. Anyways, I always have this attachment issue with all of my friends even since I was in school so it's not because I'm in love with him or anything. He's the closest friend I have and probably the only one that I could connect the most. But I'm afraid that he is not feeling the same. That I'm just a \"stop\" until he find a man who can be his friend. I don't stop him from making friends but it's not helping that my face can't hide my bitterness whenever he interacts with someone that is not me. And I also enjoy my own company and I love doing stuffs by myself but I get so attached to him so I just feel better with him around. Is there anything I can do....?",

He also didn't reach out back then (3 years ago). I don't think he did so because he didn't like me, I know that he's rather quiet/insecure, so I do feel like I was the initiator in our friendship. I honestly don't think that he was or is angry at me, since I know he had a stressful time back then too, plus our whole \"breakup\" just happened at the start of covid and the first lockdown. I was too anxious to text again after a while (maybe he felt the same thing).\n\nRecently I have been seeing him 1-2 times around our campus, but I wasn't sure if it was him at first and I'm not the type to just go up to someone and talk to them. I wasn't even aware that he still lived in my town...Anyways, seeing him made me think about him and I came to the conclusion that I really miss him and our interactions. I don't think I'm romantically interested, genuinely just want to know what's happening in his life. Since this was practically my last week at uni, the chances that I randomly see him again are very small/non-existent. He doesn't use social media, but I still have his number. I've had this idea to just text him out of the blue, but I have no idea how to do that lol. It might not seem like a big deal to a lot of people, but I feel like I lost a lot of my social skills during the last years. I don't know if this is an actually awkward thing to do or if I'm blowing things out of proportion.",

In February, my family and I went through a lot of personal problems ultimately leading my dad to work out of the country. At the start of March, I realized that the people I considered to be close friends with me at University were really quite immature and plain rude when it came to considering other people's feelings and opposing opinions. Case in point, they started messing with a guy's feelings on social media and when I spoke out about it to them, they turned a blind eye to what I was saying.\n\nNow we are here, at a time during self-isolation and a virus pandemic around the world. Although everything is going bad around me, I feel as if being in my own space has brought me closer to myself and has allowed me to consider others more than I usually will. Some say it's because I became emotionally mature but I just call it part of being a human on this Earth. I've begun to work closer towards my goals, I began to reach out to that friend after my mistake and I don't want to push them into anything at all. I've begun to help out more where ever I can and be more empathetic to people around me.\n\nUltimately, if you are going through self-isolation right now, take this time to really work on yourself, think about everything that you can be grateful for and if you feel like doing that thing, go do it.\n\nBeing isolated from the world has ironically brought me closer to it and I think I'm ready to face whatever may lie ahead. You Can Too!\n\nLet's go friends.",

He has his best friend he has known since middle school. Even though they now live far, they text almost everyday (his words). She was pretty much his only close friend during his teenage years because he was suffering from social anxiety and was bad at making friends. So whenever he tells me a story from his past her name pops up a lot, which is normal cause they were inseparable at school (but they never dated or anything, they're more like siblings) And whenever I hear him say \"my best friend\" I get extremely triggered and start to feel like shit, like I'm not as valuable as she is to him (I probably am not but you understand my point lol) I swear I do not like this guy romantically, I'm just so jealous of their relationship because I always wished to have this kind of lifelong, intense ride or die friendship.

It's not abnormal for Nick to talk to literally anyone and try to befriend them in his awkwardly charming way. In that sense he reminds me of an innocent child. He's the kind of guy that will go up to someone he's never met before and say, *''Do you like bread?...''* (and genuinely want to know). He's not trying to be ironic or subversive or random. He just likes talking to people. \n\nAnyway, there's this girl from India (early twenties) who works as a cleaner at our store. I've never had any reason to interact with her as our departments have little to no overlap and so there's been no reason for the two of us to be introduced. But Nick is familiar with her (because he talks to literally everyone). And I say this being a social guy too, but I've never seen this woman in the break room, so there's never been any reason for the two of us to get to know each other. It's not even something I was consciously aware of until today...\n\nBut she passed by the deli today with a mop in her hand and Nick called out to her enthusiastically and waved *''Hi Saumya!'.* \n\nAnd then Nick turns to me and asks me if I know Saumya. I said, no, not really. I've only really seen her around. \n\nAnd then Nick says he has a secret but I can't tell Saumya that he told me this. \n\nOkay?...\n\nSo he proceeds to tell me that Saumya finds me very intimidating. \n\nI kind of expected this to go somewhere but it really didn't. That's all Nick had to tell me —Saumya— a girl I don't even know and have never even spoken to before apparently finds *me* intimidating. And both Nick and I had a laugh at this because I'm the least intimidating guy you'll meet and am friendly to just about everyone. \n\n*''I don't know why she finds you intimidating to be honest haha'',* Nicks says. \n\nI asked him for more context but he said she just brought it up to him in conversation one day that she finds me very intimidating. \n\nAnd I guess I'm just perplexed that a relative stranger is telling my co-worker that she finds me intimidating when we don't even interact with each other?... \n\nAll she would see is me serving customers affably in passing.

Be honest with yourself. \n\nWhat does a good friend look like? \n\nWhat qualities do they have? \n\nHow would they treat me? \n\nHow would they treat others? \n\nAsking these questions helps you identify the kind of person you are looking for, and can also help you understand the kind of person you need to become to be a good friend to someone in return. \n\nNext, we need to meet people. And you can do this ANYWHERE. But it takes effort. \n\nIn order to make friends, you need to become somewhat of a leader. \n\nYou need to be the person who is willing to take the first step, introduce yourself, ask questions, and be genuinely curious. Being the person afraid to fail allows others to open up more without needing to face this fear themselves. You can carry the burden. \n\nWalk up to anyone you find interesting and lead with a compliment. A compliment is an amazing icebreaker when approaching any gender because it makes people feel less worried about their appearance around you. You basically already told them they were cool. They will feel more comfortable talking to you. \n\n\"Hey, I like your shoes! They are super cool.\"\nOr\n\"Nice shirt! I love that band. \" \n\nCompliment something you honestly like. People can tell when you are being honest. \n\nIntroduce yourself, and ask them if they are free to chat \n\n\"My name is ___. Yours? I saw you sitting alone and was wondering if you wanted any company\" \n\nThe worst thing that can happen from this, is they say no, and you are back where you started. There is no loss, only the potential to gain a friend. \n\nWhen you find someone to talk to, ask them questions you genuinely would like to know the answer to. You can even spend time at home writing some questions down that you would like to ask a potential friend and memorize some of the best ones! \n\nThing like \"What kind of music are you into?\" - \"Have you seen any good shows or movies lately?\" - \"Do you play video games? Sports? Hobbies?\" You can ask anything. People are more inclined to talk about themselves because it takes less thinking than trying to ask questions. \n\nWhen you find a connection, follow it. \"I love that game, too! What was your favorite level?\" \n\nThey are bound to ask you questions about yourself in return, be honest! You want to make a friend who likes you for the real you, not the \"cool\" you. \n\nThis is where bonds are found. In mutual interests. It is also where you have an opportunity to spend time together. \n\nAfter your conversation, use that connection to plan an event. \"We both play a lot of halo. Would you be interested in hanging out sometime and doing some classic splitscreen, maybe some drinks? I haven't done that in years!\". \n\nThey may not bite, but even if they don't, you had a great conversation with another person. You had a friend for a day. \n\nAsk to exchange phone numbers or add each other on your preferred social platform. \n\nIf they do, after that, it's just maintaining it. \n\nContinue being the kind of friend you wish you had. Be kind, considerate, interested in their hobbies or thoughts, be supportive, uplifting, whatever it is that you think a good friend should be. \n\nKeep reaching out to new people to grow your friend group! Anyone can be your friend, and with more people, it is so much easier to get more and more people involved. This is how friend circles are developed. \n\nIf you can do this, I guarantee you'll eventually have more friends than you can manage to reply to all the time. Once the ball gets rolling, it really rolls. \n\nRemember, not everyone is looking to make friends. You may get rejected a few times before you can find a genuine connection. Don't worry about it. As long as you are respectful, no one will ever dislike you for showing them kindness. \n\nWell, that is my beginners guide to friend making. Does anyone else have any input? \n\nThanks for reading!",

Because of this, I essentially didn’t even need to put any effort whatsoever into making friends. It literally just happened over time as we all got to know each other and get comfortable with each other since we had all the same classes together, ate lunch together, etc. I often just followed people around and silently listened to their conversations because that was socially acceptable there. I didn’t need to join clubs or even meet people outside school. In fact, I almost never did that kind of stuff.\n\nAs you can imagine, it’s not possible to transfer that kind of behavior to college. Simply existing and being approachable isn’t going to make you friends since it’s unlikely you’ll meet the same people outside that one class/club you’re both in. Especially if you’re like me and have social anxiety and don’t like leaving your room without a specific purpose in mind. Everyone’s too busy doing their own thing to talk to you anyway unless you intentionally engage with them and I genuinely don’t know how one even does that without having months of history with that person.\n\nIs there a still way for me to make friends by just casually existing in a group, or is my only solution to try to overcome this?",

Which is weird because I love her more than anything, she's honestly my favorite person and probably the best sister I could have. Also, I know she feels connected to me, the  feeling is just not mutual. I just don't feel involved with her enough. That might be because she is my stepsister and I met her when I was 11 years old and she was 12, which means I never got to be a little kid with her. The first few months after I moved in with her we hung out a lot, but then I started staying in my room all the time until just a few months ago. I know the easy fix is to just keep asking her if she wants to do something or just tell her about the problem, but I just can never get words out of my mouth. I feel too shy around her, and I need to fix that. It's a huge problem because, how am I going to make a connection with her if I can't even bring myself to ask her if she wants to watch a show with me? I've thought maybe being stoned/drunk to get rid of the nervousness would help, but making myself dependent on stuff like that at 15 years old is probably not a good idea. I need to do this all soon, because in just 2.5 years, she will turn 18 and move out, and I will miss out on my chance to be siblings with her.\n\nI doubt I explained the situation very well, but you probably shouldn't expect someone posting on r/socialskills to be good with words anyway.",

        "text": "It's been bugging me a bit. I had kept myself in self isolation for a couple or three months due to some other issues, so I had barely met anyone in the semester. But i still had close friends from three years ago who i met here and there, barely, but they are my circle. \n\nI (22 M) slowly started opening up and hanging out more and went out with a friend (22 F) to pass time. It was fun. We met again. This time we ended up also going out to eat and then went to a pub. We got a little drunk where we were able to open up emotionally and connect a lot, and things escalated and we ended up together for the night.\n\nAfter that, it was confusing for her and I didn't feel right about it either. She said she didn't know what she wants and wasn't sure if she even wanted to talk to me, and said she had barely met me at all before in the semester, and said that she had other things (which i do know about and she told me about them before) going on, and her emotions just turn off, this was too much on top of it. Said she didn't want me to catch feelings or anything like that. Said she wanted space before we could talk, I understood and I gave her space.\n\nLater on, like nearly a month after, she sent me a follow request from her 2nd instagram account, I accept, she removes me few hours after. I sent a text after a week to checkup to see if she's okay but got no response. I let it pass by, hoping time will help fix the friendship and maybe help forget the night. Then, another month after, which is about a couple days ago, she removed me from her main instagram as well. No explanation or nothing like that.\n\nI don't know if I should reach out, and try to talk to her. A part of me does, because I do really value her as a friend and that's how I see her, especially since she's part of the circle and was someone i could open up to. But another part of me just feels that it will come off as needy (which I guess I kind of am, because after self isolation i really do need time with friends), and I would just be dumping my self respect into the bin, and there's no point to it because i guess the ghosting is her way of saying she's not interested in the friendship or any kind of connection or fixing it. I am torn between the two. Immediately I wanted to reach out since it's bugging me a lot and I don't want to lose her as a friend, but now I am thinking I shouldn't. \n\nWhat would you guys advise?",

        "text": "What does it mean to be a respected person? \nThis is a question I see a lot here, and there is always a debate about whether or not you need to demand respect or earn it. I believe the latter is true. \n\nWe earn respect through the actions we take within the world, not from how we look or what we own. But in how we treat others and carry ourselves. \n\nA respected person is an emotionally strong person. \n\nSomeone who can bear the burdens of a situation when others cannot. \n\nSomeone who can take criticism and hate and stand tall in the face of adversity.\n\nSomeone who can show respect and kindness towards those who do not reciprocate it. \n\nSomeone who will stand up against injustice and stand beside those in need. \n\nThere are simple things you can do to earn respect every single day. \n\nThings like; holding the door for people, showing kindness, treating others with respect, smiling at everyone regardless of their reaction, being the person who reaches out to others, letting someone know they are valued. \n\nWhen you have an intact moral compass, you can become a leader that so many people need and look up to.\n\nBringing people up and together will create a circle of love around you. It truly is contagious. It shows people there is good in the world, and it provides others an example of how to act. People will look up to you. Others will look down on you for being so selfless and still happy. But they will envy your happiness. \n\nEarning respect has nothing to do with how much money you have, but with the extent of your ability to spread joy, care, and kindness. If everyone did this, the world would be a much different looking place. \n\nHow do you think respect can be earned?\nWho are some people you look up to?\nI'd love to see more examples of inspiring people. \n\nThanks for reading, I hope this helps even one person.",

When I go out in public like to the store, mall, doctors appointments, when I go on vacation people immediately avert their gaze quickly from my face to elsewhere even when we’re talking, they don’t look at me, even my doctors do it and I find it pretty insulting. I had a job interview 2 years ago and the man interviewing me didn’t look at my face ONCE!!! When I left I was so upset and confused and even cried myself to sleep that night..it really bothers me and I feel so disgusting when they do it and sometimes I get mad. Nobody else gets this treatment, just me and I really wanna know why 😩",

I know that realistically speaking, this isn't really something I should get so worked up about, but I truly do enjoy having a social life and want to expand my circle. I also see lots of other people around me who have so many more friends than I do, and while I love and appreciate the friends I have right now, I can't help but feel a little envious that they have so many more people to hang out with and text.\n\nSo my question is, what would be the best way to go about making more friends and becoming part of more friend groups? One specific thing I struggle with sometimes is connecting to people more personally, so I'd appreciate advice on that especially. For example, if I meet someone at a class I'm taking, I'm fine with small talk, but it's difficult for me to get past acquaintance-territory into actual friendship-territory.\n\nI guess it's also important to note that I had a pretty traumatic experience with a toxic friend a few years ago, and ever since then, I've been trying to limit the number of people I talk to because I'm so scared that they'll end up turning out to be like that one friend. I have to admit that I'm still a little scared to move on from that, and I'm not even sure if I should move on at all out of fear of meeting the wrong person and ending up in a similar situation again.\n\nAdvice would be appreciated.
