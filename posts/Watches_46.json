It is 36mm which I feel is perfect for my 6.5‚Äô‚Äô wrist.\n\nI‚Äôve had my head turned by Seamasters a lot in the past few months but unfortunately they‚Äôre out of my price range currently. While window shopping on Chrono24 for vintage models, the Omegamatic caught my eye. It was very unique compared to the other Seamasters I‚Äôd seen before. The cyclops date window, no helium escape valve, the bezel design and the autoquartz movement. The more I read up about it and looked at it, the more I fell in love with it so I went ahead a purchased it!",
