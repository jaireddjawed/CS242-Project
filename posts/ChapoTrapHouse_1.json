        "text": "We still need a strong and everlasting bench of progressive lawmakers all over the country even if we get the best case after the midterms, so the only two who really have a chance to win are Sanders and Warren, who are the best and second best Senators in the country by a landslide, all their flaws included. I don't think they'll run together in the primary; they'll talk it out then decide what happens after the midterms. Sanders wrote in his book that he only ran because Warren didn't.\n\nBefore that, we need progressives to populate Congress and hold the balance of power like, eventually, a 30 to 50-member Justice Democrats Caucus so the establishment needs their votes, our votes, for shit to happen. Without that, President Warren and President Sanders will not get anything done. We need to keep this momentum going long after the election.\n\nA look at the rest of the roster doesn't show much promise. Biden is an instant nonstarter, Booker is too fake and spineless, Cuomo is too corrupt, Harris is a cop, Gillibrand is too much an opportunist, and Avenatti is a grifter. Everyone except Biden has proven they will change policies if forced, precisely because they're afraid of the left wing, but I'd rather an ally who we can push than an obstacle we need to fight. If it's Gillibrand or Harris, it's easier to get them to our table than Obama and Clinton.\n\nNext to that, President Warren isn't so bad a thing; her worst is still better than their best. I prefer a woman of color who's younger and more progressive than even Bernie, but if this is our best shot, I'm game. ",

They provide false sense of accomplishment to CHUDs who have no real accomplishments.\n2. They are so time-consuming most gamers are unpopular assholes with no social life.\n3. They emphasize competition while being explicitly unfair in most cases. See player vs player in any stat grind game or all the variations of pay2win that exist in online gaming.\n4. The lack of effective community moderation and relative ease of anonymity lets shitty, abusive cultures flourish\n5. They encourage us vs them mentality with their factions systems, binary moral narratives, and the cult-like player groups that form around online multiplayer\n6. Games tend to have themes of warfare, conquest, and totalitarian command to provide drama and excuses to empower the player\n7. excessive gaming is a symptom of negligent caretakers in the case of minors and retarded social development in the case of adults\n8. Gamers are sedentary lard-asses with no sex appeal. Even gamers who have the rare self-discipline to eat right and work out tend to waste so much time on their insipid consumerism that they don't develop enough real social skills to form healthy real-life relationships. Having no real friends and no sex lets the shitty mental illnesses and delusions of these trolls fester",
