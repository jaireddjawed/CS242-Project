My properties have all been 12.5 million a year in Food and beverage revenue or more. I have spent 15 years in casinos, Casino resorts, 4/5 star hotels, and now in a massive hospital. For 21 years, I have worked nights, weekends, and holidays, and in hospitals I'm done everyday at 4pm, I have almost all weekends off, all holidays off, and started with 29 days paid vacation per year. As an Executive Chef, I make around 100K a year, typically carry 2 cell phones (one personal, one for work). I am a C.S.C (certified Sous Chef) and C.P.F.M (certified professional food manager) I also hold a certification from the Federal Government in Union/Manager Conflict Negotiations, as well as 2 Serv-safe certifications. I have been removed from cooking for several years now, which is still really weird to me, as I love being creative, and producing food. \nMy first REAL Chef position was when I worked for Caesars Palace Atlantic City, and was promoted to a Sous Chef, overseeing 6 outlets. Robert Irvine was my Executive Chef there, who hired me as a cook, and then tried to poach me for a Chef position when he left. I have cooked for many celebrities who have come through that property, such as Elton John, Mohammad Ali, Charles Oakley, Nikki Hilton, the Hilton family, and many more. The life span of a Casino Executive Chef is about 2.5 years max, so we have had the pleasure of relocating (from which each company pays for) 8 times. We have lived in the following cities:\nPhiladelphia- (home town)\nAtlantic City - 9 years\nDC - 3 years\nWaldorf Maryland- 7.5 months\nGreenbelt Maryland- 3.5 months\nRichmond VA - 2 years\nPhiladelphia (again) - 9 months\nWheeling West Virginia- 1 year\nColumbus Ohio- 2 months (so far)\nIn 21 years, I've worked for 5 companies total. My stress level was always very high, but I handle it much better nowadays. Please feel free to ask me any questions.....\n\nProof: \nhttp://www.theintelligencer.net/news/community/2017/10/chef-sam-kaufman-makes-splash-at-casino/\n\nProof picture:\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/0h16Y14\n\n[proof picture name and title](http://imgur.com/a/GhSHDtT) ",

        "text": "**My short bio:** Hey! I'm a 25 year old fella from Eastern Canada and long-time Redditor who builds the [Apollo Reddit client](https://apolloapp.io) for iOS. I worked at Apple in Cupertino for a summer as an iOS engineer on the enterprise team back in 2014 while I was getting my Computer Science degree. \n\nAt the time I was enamored with the late and great Alien Blue but wanted to improve on it, so I went back to school that September and spent the next three years building the Reddit client of my dreams with a really clean design that felt at home on iOS, while also being super powerful with a ton of snazzy features. Thousands of Redditors beta tested it before release and truly shaped it into something I'm super proud of.\n\nI released it last October and the support's allowed me to work on it as my full-time job since graduating university and I get feedback from the community over in r/ApolloApp to figure out what to add to it next.\n\nAnyway, people have asked for an AMA quite a bit and today seemed like a great occasion as today I'm donating 100% of the proceeds to our local animal shelter (SPCA, the Canadian version of the ASPCA in the states). We're in the midst of kitten season [and they're running low on food](https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/94vbs9/ns_spca_says_rooms_are_overflowing_with_kittens/) and I want to help out and Reddit is awesome so it seemed like a great mix. So if you're interested at all in a cool Reddit app and want to help out an awesome cause at the same time, [I'd love if you checked out Apollo](https://apolloapp.io)! You can also [donate directly](https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298) or even just donate to your local shelter because they could probably use the help!\n\nIt's a free download and there's a \"Pro\" version you can unlock for a few bucks. There's also a tip jar in the app (Settings tab) which will go toward it too if you already have Pro or are feeling extra generous.\n\nObligatory picture of the little fuzzball I adopted there: https://i.imgur.com/6qVtDgu.jpg (her name is Ruby)\n\n**My Proof:** https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1026515700146425856\n\nAMA! I'll try to answer as long as I feasibly can!",

        "text": "**MY BIO:** My name is Sammy Roth, and I’m a reporter for the Desert Sun/USA TODAY Network in Palm Springs, California. I spent six months investigating a farm baron in the Imperial Valley, requesting hundreds of records from government agencies under the California Public Records Act and reviewing thousands of pages of documents and dozens of hours of video and audio. My investigation found that public officials — including Abatti’s friends in elected office, a judge with ties to his family, and a district attorney whose second-in-command is his sister-in-law — have repeatedly made decisions that have advanced Abatti’s private interests. \n\n**MY PROOF:** [https://twitter.com/MyDesert/status/1025484878584922112](https://twitter.com/MyDesert/status/1025484878584922112)\n\n**THE STORY:** [https://www.desertsun.com/in-depth/tech/science/energy/2018/08/01/california-desert-farm-baron-builds-water-and-energy-empire/636894002/](https://www.desertsun.com/in-depth/tech/science/energy/2018/08/01/california-desert-farm-baron-builds-water-and-energy-empire/636894002/)\n\n**TL;DR:** My investigation found that Mike Abatti won tens of millions of dollars in publicly funded energy contracts despite having no previous experience in the energy industry; got permission to pump 1 billion gallons of groundwater annually without doing a full environmental review first; and won a sweeping ruling in a lawsuit to protect his access to Colorado River water — from a judge with a long history of business and social ties to several members of the Abatti family. Out of every 1,000 drops of Colorado River water that were used by California, Arizona and Nevada in 2012, 3.5 drops were delivered to farm fields owned by Mike Abatti.\n\nLooking forward to answering your questions!",

Just google 'Lombok Earthquake' if you want to read more about it. \n\n\nMy proof is my stamped and signed diving log book: [https://i.imgur.com/SPRerVS.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/SPRerVS.jpg)",
