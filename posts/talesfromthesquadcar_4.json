        "text": "Obligatory I'm on mobile so sorry for typos. \n\nThis was about 2005 I believe. \n\nI was coming back from seeing friends in Florida driving back to Ohio. I am in TN going with the flow of traffic about 80-85 in a 70. I was in the furthest left hand lane and started pulling ahead of the pack and didn't notice. I crest the hill and enter a construction zone 55 MPH and right there was a state trooper.  I'm fucked. 80 in a 55? In construction I know that is grounds for suspended licence!\n\nSo before he can even pull out of his spot.  I find a nice place roll my window down stop and keep my hands on the wheel. \n\nHe gets to me about a minuet later.  I don't remember the exact conversation. But when he got to my window I just said.  'I got nothing '.\n I do remember telling him I knew he got me so I saw no need for him to chase me. \nHe laughed.  I did still get a ticket. But lowered it to 72 in a 65. Said I was \"just outside the work zone \"  \n\nGood guy trooper that day. Saved me a lot of trouble !\n I kept it to 9 or under ( over the speed limit. I still had like 300 miles left of a 1k trip ) \n",

        "text": "In the wee hours of a Sunday, I am cruising down the freeway at a leisurely 65-70mph, slightly above the 65 limit. I say leisurely because I have not seen a single car travelling below 80mph in that particular section. I am returning home from a nearby town, about 200 miles away and I still have about 150 miles to go. This is around 1-2am in the night, so the traffic is light. And by light, I mean there's me and there's one other car about 1.5 mile ahead of me. That's it, just two cars in the entire visible stretch of highway.. And we're in a longer section with 6 lanes each way.\n\nAfter a while I see headlights from two cars, following each other, approaching behind me from distance. Judging from how quickly they caught up with me, they are doing at least 80-85 and are travelling in the same lane as I. I am travelling in the 3rd lane, so there are 2 empty lanes on left and 3 empty lanes on my right with not another soul driving for miles. Imagine my frustration when the approaching car starts tailgating me at 3 feet from my rear bumper. He's following me so closely that it is very disconcerting to see the headlights of the car behind me disappear from *all* my mirrors of my sedan. This almost never happens except at busy traffic lights when the cars squeeze together when stopped. Definitely not while cruising down the highway.\n\nNow I'm in no way a slow camper, not just in leftmost lane, but in any lane. I know how frustrating it is to be blocked by someone going below or at speed limit in the left lanes. If I see people going faster than me in my lane or passing me on right, I switch lanes to the right so that the faster traffic can move in left lanes. Not today. The entire 6 lanes are empty and you choose to tailgate me ? I'm not going to move, especially as I'm already in the 3rd lane right now. Our procession proceeds down the highway for another 2-3 miles.\n\nAfter a minute or two, the guy behind me decides to do something about me not moving over. Instead of just passing me on left, he decides to pass me on the right and then immediately cut back in my lane causing me to brake hard.. on an otherwise empty highway. The guy who was behind this guy (now behind me) almost rear ends me and I honk for quite long at the guy (now) in front of me. While this is unfolding, I see the 2nd guy now pulling the same stunt as he moves in the right lane. I look out the window and I'm thinking of shaking my head at him to discourage him from doing the same thing. Turns out, the second car is actually a marked highway patrol car. He just smiles at me seeing me shaking my head, overtakes me and immediately lights up the wonderful red-blues and pulls the other guy over. All of this action takes place within 5 seconds of the guy pulling that dick move. Sweet !\n\nI again have the now empty highway in front of me and a smile on my face which lasted all the way till I reached home. People always ask where are the cops when you need them. They are right there.",

And with that, lets relive a fun moment from my early teens.\n\nSo when i was in middle school i lived in a fairly shady part of a southern town just off the coast. a good bit of gang violence and other general insanity. i was in class when a black(this is important) student came up and started wailing on my head, i turned around and punched the kid in the jaw, at which point the school resource officer stepped in and so did the asst. principle, Remember that the kid was black, well apparently i'm suddenly a perpetrator of a hate crime according to the Asst. principle, yay right? but that's not the fun part. the fun part comes when i cursed the kid out after we were both restrained, apparently you cannot say go jump off a bridge(Bridge jumpers are common in the area) in front of a cop. turns out they were an actual deputy and not just some random mall-cop type person. One pair of handcuffs and a very resistant walk to a car later and I'm half way across the county at a mental facility, cursing the officer the entire way. according to the staff there i was being committed for a 24-72 hour psych evaluation for \"Threatening bodily harm to another person\".\n\nI later found out its common practice by the local PD to take in any student at their own Discretion.\n\nTL;DR got into a fight with an African-American student, got called racist by the principle and taken to a mental hospital. fun day right?\n\nEDIT: Words.",

        "text": "Once upon a time I was the youngest Parole Officer in my office and likely working for my states Dept. of Corrections. This of course made me the ad hoc tech support since the closest support was an hour and a half drive, or two days response time for those who have never shared an IT department with 10 other state departments. Most issues I fixed were mundane; printers, phone system, even a server reset. \n\nOne day as the office opens and shit has hit the proverbial fan. A sex offender has gone off the rails (out all night, in sketchy parts of town) A visit to his apt and a chat with the hooker/hitchhiker he picked up the previous night indicates that our boy decided to say fuck it and spend his $1800 gov. refund check from college on a hooker, booze and a whole shit ton of crack. An impressive feat for one night. \n\nAt this time most sex offenders (matching certain criteria) were placed on GPS tracking which consisted of an anklet and a box the size of a Tupperware meant for sandwiches which they carried around. The box was essentially a pager which transmitted their current/previous location periodically but wasn't instant and could also receive messages. You could however send  a command to get their current location instantly. Funny enough the guy never ditched his GPS for whatever reason. \n\nThe tech support problem is that the Dept. had not yet provided laptops to officers so you could only get a location at the office and then report the gps coordinates as they lined up with google maps. Not the most accurate way of quickly locating  a now wanted individual. As the office techie I get the idea to use my Geocaching app on my Blackberry Storm which allowed me to enter in the GPS coordinates directly and get within a few feet. Went out with the apprehension unit and literally geocached my way to arresting a sex offender with another agent texting me GPS coordinates. Had to hop a few fences and arrest the guy at gun point but it all worked out in the end. It was also the first time I saw crack in real life. Dude shoved a bunch in his mouth and we didn't realize it til he was mumbling in the backseat, we had to shake it out of him like a dog who has something they shouldn't. He ate some and started overdosing so he got a little stay in the hospital before going back to prison.  ",

        "text": "I mostly work on the freeways, and pedestrians aren't allowed there due to safety concerns. So when we get a call of one, it's usually a hitchhiker, homeless person, crazy person, someone walking to get gas, or someone who's suicidal. It's very rare I encounter a pedestrian on the freeway and it's a good experience since sane people don't walk on freeways.\n\nI received a call of a young male, walking with traffic, on the right shoulder of eastbound lanes. There's a lot of homeless people in that area, and they'll walk the 1/4 mile on the freeway from one exit to the next since it's the fastest route. They're usually gone when I show up.\n\nI rolled up to where he was last reported, and he wasn't there. I told dispatch, \"Unit 7, Gone on Arrival, Assignment Completed.\" Dispatch echoed it back. The thing about people walking on the freeway is that they're moving, so half a mile up the road I found him, and almost drove past him. He was sitting on a guardrail on the right shoulder, with light traffic flowing by at 75mph...and it looked like he was contemplating walking into the lanes.\n\n\"Unit 7, Pedestrian, give me a clearance.\" That means all other units hold radio traffic because something bad may be about to happen.\n\nI stopped my car near him and got out, as I heard dispatch say, \"Last unit with traffic, re-identify? I couldn't copy your traffic.\" I hate our radios. No clearance for me, so I was really hoping he was friendly, as I was already greeting him.\n\n\"Good morning, sir! How ya doin'?\" As I was getting closer, he was still looking away from me, at traffic, and it looked like he was sniffling. All signs to me that suicide was running through his mind. Dispatch was still chirping at me, \"Was there traffic for dispatch?\"\n\nThe pedestrian, we'll call him Mike, looked at me. \"Good morning.\" He'd had a few drinks.\n\n\"What's going on, man? You okay?\"\n\n\"Not really. My friends kicked me out of their car.\"\n\n\"Your friends kicked you out of their car? Hmm, don't sound like great friends. Where were you trying to go?\"\n\n\"We were headed back home to Madison.\" That was 90 miles away.\n\n\"That's...pretty far. How about I give you a ride off the freeway to somewhere safer and we figure out a plan?\"\n\nHe agreed. I searched him for weapons and put him in handcuffs in my car. Nothing against him, that's standard procedure. If you go in my car and you're not another cop, or under the age of 15, you're going in handcuffs. Dispatch was still talking. \"Last unit, re-ID?\"\n\n\"Unit 7, I was asking for a clearance, but the situation is normal now. One detained.\" There was more than a hint of irritation in my voice. Dispatch copied. Fortunately, even though our radios are bad, other units nearby can often copy what dispatch misses. So about 10 seconds after putting Mike in my car, my backup showed up.\n\nI spoke with Mike for a bit, and learned he went to a club the night before with some acquaintances. On their way back, they got into an argument about wanting to do some things Mike didn't feel comfortable with, so they kicked him out. His clothing, demeanor, and details he provided suggested he engaged in adult-relations for favors. I ran a warrant check, and he was clear. At that point, my concern was just helping a guy in a bad situation. His cell phone was dead, he didn't have any money, and he didn't know anyone in the area. Madison was 2 areas beyond where my office area ended, so I wasn't going to get approval to go there. I was scratching my head for transit ideas when I remembered...\n\n\"How about a bus? Are you cool taking a bus ride home? Don't sweat the ticket, I can cover it.\" \n\nTo the bus station we went. I had never and still have never taken a commercial bus anywhere, so I had no idea what ticket prices were, but I knew it'd be less than a taxi. When we got to the bus station, they had a free cell phone charging station, which worked to our favor.\n\nI ended up buying a ticket for Mike. I'm guessing this isn't a terribly rare event, because the ticket seller told me, \"Since you're buying the ticket for him, we can provide a discount.\"\n\nWe shook hands and parted ways. Before leaving, Mike told me, \"This is why I love police officers.\" State Trooper, but I let that one slide.",

        "text": "Back in the mid-1990s, immediately after graduating college, I had a job with a company that did multimedia presentations. This job involved teams of 2 people traveling the country in a [cargo van](http://imgur.com/UhMURAk) full of audio-visual equipment to run the shows, which were sold to schools, church youth groups, and the like. We had [everything but the electricity in the van](http://imgur.com/ftr0Yne): a film projector, [banks of slide projectors](http://imgur.com/5ZG2Hsj), a sound system, huge folding screens. The pay was minimal, but there were adventures. This was one. My teammate and I were both 25-year-old white females when this happened.\n\nSometime in mid-March, we were working in West Virginia and had the rear license plate stolen from our van overnight. We filed a police report and our company set about getting us new plates. The van was registered in California, so it was going to take a little while to resolve this. We were told to [make a sign](http://imgur.com/RAWiLpZ) to replace the plate and keep the police report handy as proof.\n\nAfter West Virginia, we were routed to the DC metro area. Silver Spring, I think. We worked there for a while, and then were routed somewhere west of DC. So it was April Fools' Day, late afternoon or early evening, and we were heading west on I-66 through NoVA; I was driving.\n\nSomewhere around the Fairfax/Loudon county line, we noticed a police helicopter making sweeping passes overhead. We didn't think much of it at first; it's not that uncommon. A little while later, a state trooper appeared behind me and started just hanging out there. At that point, I knew we were going to get pulled over and just wondered *when* and *how*. I kept cruising along in the right lane, at exactly the speed limit, and waited. The officer kept hanging behind me and the helicopter was tracking us from above.\n\nAfter a few minutes, another officer joined our caravan. He got in front of me. Then a sheriff and a third officer in the other lane (by this point we were far enough west of Loudon County that we were in the 2-lanes-each-way part of I-66), exactly pacing the first 2 officers. A four-point surround. Then the lights and sirens came on and I pulled over and turned off the van.\n\nThe officers didn't approach the window. They stayed clear and used their loudspeaker to instruct us to put our hands in the air; then they approached along the sides of the van with weapons drawn. They were surprised to find two white girls in the van.\n\nAn officer took *both* of our driver’s licenses and the van’s registration back to one of the cars to check us out. Conveniently for them, my license was even a Virginia license at the time.\n\nThey asked if anyone else was in the van; we said no (which was true). They asked if we had any black males in the van; we said no. They asked about the walled-off cargo area of the van, we told them it was full of a/v equipment and walled off to prevent problems with shifting cargo during travel. They requested access to the back to confirm this; I handed them the keys and put my hands back in the air.\n\nAn officer asked why I had no license plates, and I blurted out, “Oh no! Someone stole the front one too?” One of the three officers holding us at gunpoint went and looked and reported that it was actually still there. We explained the story; they didn’t even look at the police report from West Virginia.\n\nI heard through one of the officers’ radios, “These are not the suspects.”\n\nThe helicopter left. The sheriff and one state trooper left. We still had our hands in the air.\n\nThe officer who was checking our papers brought them back and slipped them onto our dashboard and said to me, “Well, Ms [Manx], I’m not going to ticket you for the license plate this time. But you’d better get it taken care of.” He then left. We still had our hands in the air and there was one officer remaining. He finally let us put our hands down, and told us that our vehicle matched the described getaway vehicle for an armed robbery and shooting in downtown DC.\n\nThe last officer left, and we continued on our westward journey.\n\nEDIT to explain the title:  \nAfter our adventure was over, we had to call our team manager to tell the story. Because it was April Fools' Day, and because I'd been involved in a rather effective April Fools' prank against team management the year before, it was rather difficult to convince them that the story was true. It was true, though.",

        "text": "This happened some years back. I was going to school mornings and working afternoons/evenings. I got off work about 9pm every night. \n\nOn my route home, there was this one street that was really annoying. As you're driving along, the right lane suddenly turns into a turn-only lane. Then after the intersection, the same lane is a normal lane again. If I'm driving in that lane, I have to move over to the left (because I don't want to turn), then move immediately back into that lane so I can turn right at the next intersection. \n\nI drive this street everyday. One day I notice that it's not a turn-only lane anymore. The lines have been repainted and the signs are gone. It's kind of a hazard because now people that are used to it being a turn-only lane are now cutting in front of cars that don't turn. So now when I'm driving, I have to watch for cars cutting me off...\n\nOne night, I've got flashing lights right after I go through this intersection. So I pull over, thinking the cop is going around me. Nope. He pulls up behind me, and I turn into a parking lot. \n\nHe doesn't give me a clue why he stopped me, just the usual license, registration... Not responding to any inquiries. Total stone wall. When he gives me the ticket, it's for not turning in a turn-only lane. \n\nI know that once the ticket is written it's all over, but I still try to explain that that isn't a turn-only lane anymore. He's not listening. So I finally tell him that after I'm gone he should just drive the block again and look for the signs. That aren't there anymore. \n\nNext day, I've been worrying about this ticket. I am a poor college student, working my way through school. I can't afford to just pay the ticket. I've just started a new job (first job I've had in my field) and I don't want to ask my boss for time off to go to traffic court. So I called my uncle (who is a policeman). I hate doing this, too, because he gets a lot of calls from relatives wanting favors. \n\nMy uncle, the policeman, patiently listens to my story--starts to get interested about half-way through. I ask what's the best way to handle this. He tells me he can't interfere--different department and he can't step on toes. Tells me I need to talk to the officer and get the ticket cancelled. (I really, really don't want to talk to that officer again.) I give him the badge number off the ticket, and he gets the officer's name for me. Tells me to call the station and ask for the officer. Tells me not to give up. Call every day until the officer calls me back, because sometimes if they don't recognize the name they won't return calls. I ask him if this is going to make the officer angry. And he says not as much as it will if you have to drag him into traffic court and embarrass him in front of the judge. \n\nI bite the bullet and start calling. Every day. Get into work, get coffee, call the police station. \n\nThe conversation always goes like this: \n\nMe: I need to speak to Officer _____. \n\nOperator: Just a moment.\n\nShift Supervisor: Officer ____ is in the field. Would you like to leave a message?\n\nMe: Please ask him to call. My name is ____ and my number is _____. \n\nAbout Day 10, the Shift Supervisor says, \"Is this personal or business?\"\n\nMe: Business. \n\nShift Supervisor: Has he ever called you back? \n\nMe: No.\n\nShift Supervisor says, I'll make sure he does. \n\nDay 11.\n\nShift Supervisor: \"Can you tell me what this is about?\"\n\nMe: A traffic ticket.\n\nShift supervisor starts to blow me off, but he's a little irritated and says, \"How did you get this officer's name?\"\n\nMe: From a relative who is a policeman. I talked to him about this situation and he told me the easiest and least embarrassing way to resolve it is to talk to the officer. I really don't want to take this to traffic court, but if he won't talk to me I'll have to do it.\n\nSo then the shift supervisor asks me for the story. After I tell him, he says that yeah, he knows about that intersection. \n\nThen he tells me he will take care of it. Call him back tomorrow. \n\nNext day when I call, he tells me the ticket has been cancelled. I go down to the station to pick up the paperwork. When I get down there, he greets me personally and walks me through everything. Then he tells me to keep the paperwork in my car for a couple of weeks just in case. Really nice guy. \n\nI don't know what happened with the officer who gave me the ticket, but I think I got him in trouble. The shift supervisor was none too happy with him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So, this story of mine goes back roughly 5 or so years ago. \n\nSome Context: \n\nI'm based in New Zealand, where the drinking age is legally 18 and in most places (where I was), drinking in public is allowed unless heavily intoxicated. I am (at the time) also 18. So the idea of getting drunk was epic, and hangovers were not such a thing. \n\n**To the Story!**\n\nA buddy of mine (He told me to write it here... /u/Nedkelly348 ) was having his 21st birthday a couple K's up the road from me. Having been friends since we were both young, naturally I was invited and it was license to get rather... Sloshed...\n\nNow, me being a 18yo 6ft tall ginger unfortunately means to actually get drunk I have to drink a fair bit. So decided I'd get a lift there as driving was simply out of the question.\n\nQueue me approximately 2am in the morning, a box (12 bottles or so) of beer, royally loaded up to the eyeballs with booze, I decided it's a good time to go home and call it a night.\n\nI grab 3 beers, shove two into my pockets, and pop the third ready for the walk, then sent myself on my merry ol' stumbling-bumbling way.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting, and as Ned will quite happily confirm. Sometimes when it's warm and I'm drunk, blood noses become a thing (thankfully sorted that now!). \nI also don't mean a little drip either. I mean, full blown \"WTFWON'TTHISSTOP?!?\" Sorta thing.\nThis is the moment when I get a blood nose about 1km from my home, now down to 1 beer (one per KM was my idea :P ). It just so happens that I'm wearing a white shirt and a police car comes past me and see the front of my shirt covered in blood.\n\nNow, the police in NZ are quite often really great. They are. Truely. I shall reference the whole \"Blow on the pie\" video on youtube (good watch). \nIn my case however, there'd been a report of a fight somewhere nearby and a guy apparently had a busted up nose. Guess who fits that description... \n\nThey ask me the usual questions of \"Do you have ID? Where have you been? Been in a fight?\" you get the idea. As they're about to cuff me (understandable, 'suspect' had been in a fight), an old boy who'd been outside having a ciggy out front of his house and enjoying the spectacle that I was. Piped up... He mentioned that he saw me walking along, minding my own business when I got a blood nose out of no-where. \n\nSaved by old man having a cheeky cigarette 2:30 in the morning. \nThe police then offered to give me a lift back home, and as a joke drove up the drive way with the lights on, because they knew I was going home to my mum... That was an interesting conversation haha\n\nEDIT: change of context.",

Dad was the spotter I was the shooter, you get the drift...\n\n\nwe would go out and shoot it once every 2 weeks at a safe place in the middle of the local desert, and in my down time studying charts and notes made, as well as reloading to save a tad bit of cash. when my father had his back surgery after injuring it during his monthly drill he was not able to go shoot with me. or for that matter drive me to the range (desert).  \n\n\n**Mini story:**  \nlarge caliber firearms in the middle of the desert not quite far enough away from town brings the local sheriff out to see what is going on. after a warning and a look at what we were shooting he came out on his day off and joined us. really chill guy.  \n**end of mini story.**  \n\n\nas dad was down and my schedule to shoot interrupted I being the genius that I am realized that the m82 fits in my motorcycle backpack disassembled,  with just the muzzle of the barrel sticking out, and the stock sticking out. not seeing a problem I loaded my saddle bags with the ammunition and targets I would need for the day. wrapped the barrel and stock so they wouldnt rattle and scratch. scope and scope case in the other bag, .45 Springfield left hip, Glock 21  [tank holster](http://handgunmount.com/images/100_0087.jpg) (imagine that on this [BIKE](http://i.imgur.com/JO5vq2h.jpg)) and probably about 100rnds of ammo, helmet, and full riding gear.  \n\n\nI left early morning on a nice summer day at the end of June, made it out of town with some odd looks but thats common for me when I open carry on the bike, out in the middle of the big city notice the flashing lights behind me. **Me = Me**, **Officer1 = Officer1**,  \n\n\n*I pull over, stay on the bike, hit the kill switch, arms straight out like an airplane*  \n&gt; **Officer1:** *over intercom* \"DO NOT MOVE\" *steps out of vehicle, sidearm drawn* (I don't blame him) *steps behind me*  \n&gt; **Officer1:** \"I am going to disarm you on your left hip\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"yes Sir, No problem\"  \n&gt; **Officer1:** \"are there any other weapons that I should know about besides the obvious one sticking out of your bag?\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"yes sir, Left side of bike, tank holster\"  \n&gt; **Officer1:** *removes the glock* \"is that it?\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"yes sir\"  \n&gt; **Officer1:** \"please give me your keys and you can rest your hands on the bars and wait, do not do anything else\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"yes sir\"  \n&gt; **Me:** *while waiting another officer arrives*  \n&gt; **Officer1:** *walks back up with Officer2 observing from behind*  \n&gt; **Officer1:** \"please remove your helmet\"  \n&gt; **Officer1:** \"licence, registration and insurance please\"  \n&gt; **Me:** *gives requested info with the addition to my CCW permit*  \n&gt; **Officer1:** *hands info to Officer2*  \n&gt; **Officer1:** \"now explain to me what you have in there and where your going\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"just headed out past (TOWN!) to the west desert to do some long range shooting Sir.

        "text": "First time poster. Not native English speaker. Formatting tips are appreciated.\n\nMy father has been a fireman all is life. He also organized the weekly training exercises for the local FD and some major exercises for the entire region. This story takes place about 10 years ago. I was 18 years old at the time.\n\n\nI was playing victim in a major exercise in the fake village we have for emergency service training. A bus crashed in to a small river and i was in one of the front seats half submerged and with my leg jammed pretending it was broken. Since i wasn’t in any real danger i was one of the last to be cut out of the bus (with big pneumatic shears).\n\n\nThe exercise went well and we debriefed in good spirits. After that I was standing around outside having a smoke with some of the FD guys watching the riot police roll up for an exercise that afternoon. When a guy in civvie clothes walked up to us asking how our exercise went.\n\n\n&gt;FD1: “great, no problem”\n\n&gt;Guy: “nice. I am here to coordinate the riot exercise. Do you guys have anything to do this afternoon because I could use your help”\n\n&gt;FD2: “nah we’ve got the afternoon off. Why are you asking?”\n\n&gt;Guy: “I could always use some extra hooligans\"\n\n&gt;Internal me: is this guy seriously asking random firefighters to go toe to toe with armored riot cops with shields and massive sticks? I have to be part of this\n\n&gt;FD2: \"I am to old for that shit but i think some guys would love to help\"\n\n&gt;FD1: \"sure do. just tell us what to do\"\n\n&gt;Guy: \"get a group together and speak to the guys with the hi vis jackets. I'll inform them that you are coming.\n\n&gt;Internal me: ohmygodohmygodohmygod this is happening.\n\n\nAt that moment a couple of vans arrived with the other rioters. all of them riot policemen. as an RP you often get called to train against other district RP. 8 firefighters, one other dummy victim and me. our mob was now 45 man strong. and we were ready for a briefing.\n\n\nwe went over the safety procedures 3 times. we got to meet the paramedics on site.  we got protective vest and helmets. \n\n\nthe scenario:\nmatch day. our team lost. we are not happy and decide to remodel the stadium and the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n\n45 Big dudes. CHECK.\nLittle to no plan. CHECK.\nAdrenalin. CHECK.\nOn drugs. uh...... no.\n3 out of 4 aint bad. We were a good group of hooligans.\n\n\nOur mob was placed on a small street and told to wait on the signal. When the signal came we started chanting and shouting obscenity's. 2 RP vans skidded to a halt at the end of the street about 75 meters from us. 20 officers came out. The street was very narrow. They formed up in two lines. even then they where shoulder to shoulder. easy target for our improvised ammo.\n\n\nI was fully aware that this was an exercise. but this was getting scary now. our group was far larger but the RP was slowly marching forward until they where about 20 meters from us. we were shouting at the top of our lungs. they advanced in silence. some of the rioters started to charge. and on cue so did the RP.\n\n\nThey had a system going on. the lines split in to four to make space for their batons. first rank ran past the first charging rioters and formed a proper viking shield-wall. second line kneecapped the now trapped rioters with their batons. and then moved up to assist the first line. third line manhandled them back a few meters where fourth line cuffed them and passed them on to normal officers behind them. in 30 seconds we where 4 man down. after that they formed a line and started pushing I got hit on my protected shoulders a couple times. it hurt but adrenaline kept me going. suddenly the shield wall opened up in front of me and I got yanked trough.\n\n\nI was in trouble. BIG TROUBLE\n\n\nthings went fast from there. baton to the shin. fell flat on my face. mouth full of dirt. got dragged about 15 meters back and had someone plant his knee in my back when he cuffed me. I got manhandled back up and an RP guy's left hand held my neck and his right held my cuffs. He ran me to where the rioters where being held and put me face down on the ground. He got new cuffs and ran back in.\n\n\nA bit later fight was over. after they captured 1/3 of us the rest wisely decided to run for it.\n\n\nMore exercises were held that afternoon but I was bruised up and decided not to take part anymore and just watch from a distance\n\n\nI never want to fight these guys ever again. Not even in training.\n",

        "text": "This story takes place when I was 17 years old, and had only had my license for about a year, give or take. I'm from a small town, so naturally all we had to do drink and do stupid things, or at least we thought. It started out like any other Saturday night. Find someone who would buy us beer, consume said beer and generally enjoy ourselves. Drinking and driving happened frequently, because nothing bad would ever happen to us,  right? We were untouchable.\n\nA few of us had gotten together at a friends shop outside of town off an old dirt road, about 15 miles from the town. I had driven along with my one of my good friends, C. The night is winding down to a close, as my 1am curfew is approaching. From where we are, I would safely be able to make it to my house by taking all dirt roads, as was my original plan. I tell C that I am ready to hit the road, and that he should make sure he had a ride before I left. He then practically begs me to give him a ride back to town, so he could grab his car and go get another buddy of ours. I really didn't want to thrown ant wrenches into my \"fool-proof\" plan, but I eventually agreed to drive him back. I had had quite a few beers at this point, and was in absolutely no condition to drive, but the other guys did it all the time, so I'll be fine. So I thought. We each grab two more beers for the road, and depart down the gravel roads to drop off C. \n\nWe approach where C's car is on the edge of town with no issue. He grabs his last beer and we say our goodnights. I see a car that may have looked like a police car heading the same direction I was going to go pass by, so I take a lap around the town to avoid the cop. After killing some time, I get on the highway leading towards my house. I figured it was late enough that the cop would be heading home soon, so I would be fine to take the highway all the way to my house. Soon after, I notice two pairs of headlights behind me, following rather closely. One of the vehicles I identified as another friend from my school, G. I figured he was just following me as a joke, and I knew he lived out the same way I did. I didn't think anything of it. The second car was still unidentified at this point in time. \n\nI got about a mile and a half away from my house, when all of the sudden G turns on his turn signal and passes me on the highway. He's giving some type of hand signal that I couldn't understand as he's going by. I didn't have his phone number, so I just ignored it as the second car speeds up and gets closer on my tail. Oh shit, is that a light bar on that? No. Please no. I'm almost home. \n\nSure enough, cherries and berries are lighting up in my rear-view mirror. Fuck. County Sheriff. I pulled over to the shoulder of the two-lane highway and put on my four-ways. I looked down and to my horror, noticed one open beer can and one closed one in my cupholders. I quickly tossed both of them under the seat. I grab my Copenhagen and throw a dip in, hoping to mask the alcohol smell on my breath. \n\nThe deputy approached my rolled-down window and introduced himself:\n\n\"Evening son, know why I stopped you?\"\n\" No Sir, I really don't. I don't believe I was speeding.\"\n\"No, you weren't. Your tail lights are out, were you aware of that?\"\n\"I was not, Sir. I'm actually really close to my house, and I can get them fixed in the morning.\"\n\" Oh, ok.\"\n\nThe officer then got kind of a strange look on his face and leaned in just a tad, narrowing his eyes at me.\n\n\"Have you been drinking tonight, son?\"\n\"No, absolutely not, Sir. Never.\"\n\"Hm. What's this smell I'm picking up then?\"\n\"It could be alcohol, Sir. I gave a friend a ride home earlier who said he had been drinking.\"\n\"Is that so? Stay here. I'll be back.\"\n\nHe then returned to his patrol pickup, leaving me to fight back a horrible need to evacuate my bowels. This is it. This is how I fuck up my life. I'll be doomed to stay in this shit-hole county and work some meaningless job and hate my life. I'll knock up some nasty chick and be stuck here forever. I'll have to face my father who has been sober for over 10 years, and tell him that I'm heading down his same path. He'll never look at me the same.\n\nThe deputy came back to my window and shined his light in my eyes, doing standard tests for field-sobriety. He asked me to step out of the vehicle and do some more tests, of which I complied. I think I passed the tests okay, but I never found out. He then asked me to shut off my car and come sit in his pickup for a moment. Front seat with no shiny bracelets, believe it or not. I climbed in and he asked me some more questions.\n\n\" Have you ever been in trouble before?\"\n\"Not with the law, Sir. Only my parents. i got caught drinking a while back and they pretty much shut down my social life for a year.\"\n\" Do you have anyone you can call to come get you?\"\n\nI tried calling both my parents, despite it being around 1:30 AM. No luck. I then tried calling my grandparents. My grandma answered. I knew she would, because she always slept with her cell phone in their room in case of an emergency. I think this qualified as one. I told her that I had been pulled over and that I needed an adult to come get me, and that the deputy wanted to speak with them. She said she would be there soon after she woke my grandfather. The deputy told me to go wait back in my car for them to arrive. \n\nAfter what seemed to be an eternity of thinking about how bad I fucked up, the deputy came back to my window and motioned for me to follow him. I did so, and found that my grandparents were parked behind his pickup. He opened up the sliding side door of their van and told me to get in. My grandfather then began to question me about the events leading up to me being pulled over.\n\n\"C called me and asked me for a ride, so I went and got him before I went home from (other friends) apartment. I did, and he left beer in my car. That's what the smell is from. This  deputy believes that I was drinking and driving.\"\n\n\"Was you?\n\"No, Sir.\"\n\"Deputy, if my grandson said he wasn't drinking, he wasn't. This boy wouldn't lie to me like that.\"\n\"Alright then. If one of you two adults would drive his car home, we'll all call it a night.\"\n\nI shook the deputy's hand and thanked him, and we set off. I gave the unopened beer to my grandpa once we got to my house. I went in the house and called it a night. I'll admit, I may have cried before going to sleep.\n\nI cried because I knew I was an asshole. I lied to a cop, I lied to my grandparents, and I lied to myself. I sold out a close friend to save my own ass as well. I was off scot-free, but I still feel guilty about it. I've never told my grandfather the truth, and I don't think I ever will. He doesn't need to hear that I lied to him straight to his face. I still think about that deputy who let me off with a more than easy DUI conviction. I'm forever grateful for it, despite the fact that it shouldn't have happened that way. I should have probably been arrested and faced with the consequences of my actions, but I wasn't. I still wonder why he didn't arrest me. because I was a stupid fucking kid, and he didn't want to bare the burden of slapping me those charges? I don't know. I'm not even sure why I typed this out, but I did. \n\nThank you, all those who serve and protect. Those who make hard decisions like this. Those who protect total strangers and sacrifice their lives to do god's work. Thank you.",

        "text": "This happened years ago when I was 18 but another story I just read reminded me of it and as I am still grateful to the cop so I figured I would go ahead and tell the story. \n\nWhen I was in high school I would work the Supercross when it came to town - setting up safety bails and barriers, putting up banners, and other similar busy work - in exchange for all access passes for me and a few friends. Part of the gig was also helping to tear everything down after the race was over which led to myself and two friends leaving the arena at about 1 or 2 in the morning. \n\nAt the time I lived about an hour away from the arena out in the middle of nowhere and by the time I had gotten out of the city the only thing to keep me distracted was passing cornfields and the occasional snore of my two friends that were in the truck with me. I had music going but anyone who has driven in a deserted area late at night after a long day (had started about 6 a.m. the day before) knows that music doesn't really help keep you awake; especially if you are playing it softly so as to not disturb your friends. \n\nBy this point we are driving on a straight shot county highway about a mile from the county line. The road at the county line has kind of an S curve to it with a ravine that was about 8 feet or so deep on each side - several accidents have happened at this turn. \n\nAs you may have guessed I fell asleep at the wheel and while I had slowed down I was still going 30 or so miles an hour when I woke up hearing a blurp of sirens behind me. When I realized what was happening I pulled over and the cop came up to the window and asked if I had been drinking - it turns out that I had been swerving all over the road as well as going well under the speed limit - and by the time he stopped me I was close enough to the S curve turn that we would have hit it in a matter of minutes - and likely gone over the side at 30 mph. \n\nI explained what was going on to the cop (helped by our \"staff\" shirts we were wearing) and he let me go and actually offered to follow us until we turned off of the highway (even technically leaving his jurisdiction as we crossed into the next county). \n\nFor the rest of the ride my friends stayed awake with me with music blaring and windows rolled down so I was plenty awake but to this day I am convinced that if that officer hadn't pulled me over myself and my friends would likely have either been seriously injured or killed when we ran off the road. So, to all officers who patrol and keep us safe when we do stupid things like driving when we are too damn tired to be on the road, thank you.\n ",

        "text": "I told this story a long time ago on reddit but figured I would share it here. \n\nA few years ago we had one of those holidays off of work that, normally, only post offices gets off. Think it was MLK day. All of us, friends and coworkers, decided it would be a good idea to clean out our gun safes and head to the range. We loaded up well over 30 pistols and about as many rifles and shotguns into the backseat and trunk... of my Hyundai Elentra. \n\nSo I am driving 9 over the speed limit because here the speeding ticket is minor and does not really go on your record until you hit 11 over. I get pulled over and the entire time the officer is in his car I am thinking to myself how am I going to explain all of these guns. \n\nThe officer gets to my window. All from memory so some of this will be paraphrased. \n\nOfficer - Good morning sir. Do you realize you were going over the speed limit there?\n\nMe - I was just driving along with the traffic officer. Was not really sure how fast I was going. Although officer I have a duty to inform you of the firearms I have in my car. \n\nI hand him my license and my Texas CHL, the name has changed to LTC now but then it was called the CHL. \n\nOfficer - As in multiple?\n\nMe - Yes sir. We are heading to the range. \n\nI have tinted windows and the way they were stacked you could not really see them from his angle. \n\nOfficer - OK how many do you have and where are they located in your car. \n\nMe - It may be better just to show you. May I roll my window down? (When i am carrying I never take any kind of action without asking the officer first.)\n\nHe nods yes and I roll my window down. As I do, some of the ends of a few of the rifle, mosin nagants and a PTR91, poke out of the window since they were leaning agianst it. \n\nIn the back seat were 3 mosin, 2 AR15s, 1 PTR91, 2 lever action rifles, remmington 270, an AK knockoff, and an SKS. In the other seat was my friend with his hands on his head. Between his legs were 3 shotguns, another AR 15, and a muzzle loading musket. In the middle between the two seats were ammo bags, handgun cases, and a few loose pistols wrapped in t-shirts. \n\nThe officer did the whole lower his aviators in kind of shock as he looked at what he saw.\n\nOfficer - Any more?\n\nMe - I will pop the trunk for you. \n\nThe officer walked to the back and saw in the trunk a few rifle boxes, a secured but loose keltec sub2k, more pistols, a ruger 10/22, and my friends 50 cal. \n\nThe officer closed my trunk and walked up to my window handing me my license and CHL back. \n\nOfficer - I am going to give you a warning this time.

My dad, being in the army, was off doing training in Atlanta,  so I was allowed to drive his old truck to work for the time being. I had a friend in the passenger seat who worked with me at the time. \n\nThe road we were taking had a bit of work being done on and off so there was a lot of gravel. Being young and stupid, I took a turn a bit too fast and totaled the truck on a tree. Airbags didn't go off, drivers side door was blocked by a tree, but we were fine, with some really good seatbelt burns. I had to have my friend roll out of her side before I could follow. A nice older gentleman called 911 for us while I called my mom to tell her what happened.\n\nWhile I'm speaking to the cop a younger guy pulls up and asks if we're OK. We tell him we're fine and go to wave him off, but not before the cop looks at him and asks him to pull over. \n\nCop asked my mom and I to hold on while he went to talk to this guy. He points to the totaled truck and says \"these two girls just had their lives saved by their seatbelts. You should follow their example,\" and hands him a ticket for not wearing one. \n\nMy mom later called my dad to tell him what happened. Opened with \"what color do you want your new truck?\" \n\nSince then, I don't put my car in gear until everyone in my vehicle is buckled, and I've started taking it a bit slower on the roads.",

Things got quiet around 2pm on that Wednesday afternoon, so we decided to do some speed enforcement on the highway. State Patrol rarely is seen on the stretch of highway going through that city, so it's almost up to us to enforce the speed. \n\nSo we park under a bridge and he pulls out the laser. He tests it on a few cars to verify it was working well, then hands it to me. \nFirst pull, I catch a Pontiac in the left lane going 82 in a 65. Officer throws the Charger in gear, and we fly after him to catch up. We finally catch up after about a quarter mile thanks to traffic, and pull behind him and initiate. \nThe guy pulls over, but does so right next to a guard rail. \n\nO: (Over intercom) Pull forward past the guard rail! x4\n\nO: (Very annoyed over intercom) Pull forward past the guard rail!! *Sticks hand out window and points forward*\n \nS: *Finally gets what's happening and pulls forward a whopping 4 feet.*\n\nO: Well this is as good as it's gonna get.\nFrom this point, I'm listening to the officer from inside the car. Whatever his audio recorder picks up, plays throughout the stereo system in the car. \n\nO: *Approaches car and greets* Hi sir, Officer Smith with the local PD, do you know why I stopped you?\n\nS: Was I speeding sir? \n\nO: Yes sir you were, I clocked you at 82, do you know the speed limit here on this road?\n\nS: *looks out windshield to speed limit sign 15 feet directly in front of him* I'm gonna go with 65?\n\nO: Yes sir that's correct.

No, it's my friends, he let me borrow it to get food.\n\nO: Alright what's his name, and can I get your DL and the insurance for the vehicle?\n\nS: Uh yeah, if I can find the insurance, of course you can, sir. *Never finds insurance*\n\nOfficer comes back to vehicle and we do the standard checks.

        "text": "One of the biggest things my agency always emphasizes is honesty. That's whether it's from the members of the public or from it's own Troopers. Here's two quick stories on that.\n\n1\n\nI stopped a driver for speeding on a straight, four lane freeway. It was 2am, no traffic around, and at this time all I care about are drunk drivers and felons. Upon stopping him, I smelled alcohol coming from the vehicle. He admitted he had a couple drinks, as did his passengers. I had him exit the car and performed a few Field Sobriety Tests, and he was safe to drive. Once he was back in the car, I asked him, \"Were you aware of how fast you were going?\" He told me, \"My speedometer said 81.\" It was a 65 zone. I handed him his driver's license back and told him, \"Pretty close. I paced you at 82. Your honesty is getting you out of a ticket. Slow down and drive safe.\"\n\n2\n\nI was driving in heavy traffic when I spotted a driver two lanes to my left, with her right hand up to her right ear, something in hand, mouth moving. It looked like she was holding a clam-shell style phone. State law prohibits using a phone while driving. I moved into position behind her and pulled her over. Upon contacting her, I observed she had three passengers in the car, and a large reflective bracelet on her right hand that I may have mistaken for a phone.\n\n\"Good afternoon, ma'am. I may be mistaken, but the reason I stopped you is for using your cell phone while driving.\"\n\n\"Well, if I'm being totally honest, I was using my phone.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your honesty, and it's probably going to get you out of a ticket.\" I ran her history and her driver's license, and she wasn't breaking any other laws, so she earned a warning.",

Large truck and tight spaces don't mix well, but I always tried to cause as litlle disturbance as possible.\n\nI came to the last delivery location, but the normal spot I use was taken, so I had to drive a bit forwards. This meant blocking a bicycle lane and third of the car lane. I do my delivery and carry the dirty carpets back to the truck. I hear someone yell \"hey!\" but I ignore it, thinking it was some drunk idiot yelling to another drunk idiot. I finished loading the carpets as I hear the same voice again yelling \"Hey!\". I look and see this angry bicyclist (=AB).\n\nMe: What?\n\nAB: You can't park there!\n\nMe: I'm not parking. I'm makin...\n\nAB: You are parking illegaly!\n\nMe: Do you even know what parking means?\n\n(In Finland, stopping the car for loading/unloading isn't considered parking, it is considered stopping)\n\nAB: I'm not an idiot, I know what parking means! You asshole parked illegaly!\n\n(I'm usually very calm, but won't tolerate being called something I'm not)\n\nMe: Fucking idiot! This is STOPPING, NOT PARKING! LEARN THE FUCKING LAW IF YOU'RE GOING TO COMPLAIN! \n\nInsults were thrown back and forth for a while. I then spotted a cop car coming our way and waved them over.\n\nPolice Officer: What's going on here?\n\nMe: He's harassing me and causing disturbance.\n\nPO: (steps out) So what's the problem?\n\nMe: I was making a delivery and he came yelling that I parked illegaly.\n\nAB: You did! Asshole.\n\nPO: You shut up and come here. \n\nAB: (comes over) Give him a ticket for parking illegaly!\n\nMe: I'm not parking!\n\nPO: Both of you shut up and listen. As he was making a delivery, it is not parking but stoppin. So, no, I won't give him a ticket. Now...\n\nAB: But the sign there says no parking.\n\nPO: Don't interrupt me. As I said it's stopping. Stopping is allowed here. Now if you (AB) don't leave right now, I'm going to arrest you for causing a disturbance.\n\nAB storms off, grumbling about how the police don't know how to do their job, his rights being abused and, for some reason, immigration (I'm about as Finnish as a Finn can be, same for the cop).\n\nThe officer wishes me a nice day and takes off. I finish loading and head to the depot, as this was the last delivery of the day. My manager and co-workers got a good laugh when I told them the story. Hopefully you get as well.\n\nEDIT: formating",

I can get my fucking burrito on a bull shit call about kids doing ding ditch.  \n\nDispatch: stand by units, I'm clearing you off that suspicious person call and putting you on the domestic disturbance, it is being upgraded to a shooting, dispatch to rank. \n\nSgt Y: What are the comments? Put me in route.\n\nDispatch: All I have is a shooting at 300 street.\n\nMe: Drop that shooting. \n\nKentucky: Drop that code 2, shooting. \n\n[Inner me]: MY FUCKING BURRITO NOOOO!\n\nI hit my lights and siren and turn off from the road with the armed robbery vehicle and start driving to the interstate, I'm on the wrong side of my district and have to haul ass to get to the shooting. I get on the interstate and start going through my mental checks, I push down my holster's first retention setting, turn on my vehicle camera and my body worn camera, and say to myself I should have eaten breakfast.\n\nI'm first in the area.\n\nMe: M'am I'm standing by in the area for back... stand by I'm being flagged down. I'll advise. DROP THE MACHETE, WALK TOWARDS ME. \n\nI arrive on scene and have a man with a machete over a woman covered in blood, several people screaming at me to stop the man. The man complies and drops the machete with the point into the ground and starts waddling towards me. I notice he has both legs bandaged and he listens to all of my commands as I tell him to get down on the ground on his knees and place his stomach on the ground and put his arms behind his back. He is an older man in his 60's. \n\nME: Units step it up,  M'am I have a victim, I'll advise in a moment. \n\nKentucky: I'm on scene. \n\nKentucky runs over to me, I yell at him to watch my perp and keep him there I'm gonna check on the victim. The victim had ran next door with the aid of some very brave neighbors and was sobbing hysterically. \n\nI still have no idea what's going on, but I ask the important questions, have you been shot, where are you hurt? She tells a grim story, she came over to her ex-husband's house to give him medication, when she arrived with her brother, her ex-husband produced a hand gun. The victim attempted to flee but fell down the stairs where her ex-husband waddled over her and pistol whipped her multiple times in the back of the head. Eventually shooting the ground next to the victim and then putting the gun down and grabbing a fucking machete and placing it on the victim's back but did not stab her. She hadn't been shot or stabbed but the back of her head had a lot of blood and lacerations.\n\nWe transport her to the hospital with EMS. Her brother then tells me how his sister's ex-husband had pointed the gun at him and told his sister (victim) to get in the house and how she would take care of him now.\n\nMy rank arrives on scene with detectives and we began processing the scene.\n\nDetective T: \"All I heard was you saying you were on scene and your mike was still hot, and screaming DROP THE MACHETE. \n\nMe: That came through? Fuck I probably sounded like a high pitched choir boy.\n\nDetective T: Yes. Yes you did, you okay?\n\nMe: Yeah, I could have shot that guy, I didn't even see the gun until later on the truck, all I remember is seeing a guy with a fucking machete over a woman and just going through the motions, but he listened to all of my commands so I never even pointed my gun at him. \n\nI arrested the perp where he was transported to the hospital and then eventually to lock-up, with 6 felony counts. He was a real piece of work, lots of officers will say domestics are the bane of their existence, it's true for me in my jurisdiction but today was one of the worst domestics.  \n\nFucking domestics, I'm sad to report I never got my burrito that day as I had to work on that case and then go to my overtime detail. I did not eat that day, remember to eat breakfast. \n",

        "text": "Early on in the police academy, the recruits and I were arriving to the training division in business suits. At 0700 every morning we were to form up at the outdoor basketball courts for dress inspection. One such 85 degree humid morning, I forgot to leave my cell phone behind. I didn't realize it was in my pocket until 0655. The instructors were due to basket ball courts to begin inspection any second. \n\nOh flummary! I still have my cell phone! The class sighed with disapproval. What should I do!? \"Quick, put it in your sock\" said one recruit who was former military. I began to do so when the thought crossed my mind....what if they check to ensure we are all wearing the same color socks and they notice the large bulge? \n\nI still have time. Quick, I need a buddy to sprint to my car so I can ditch the contraband! My nearest recruit buddy and I go sprinting towards the parking lot (he didn't run all the way to my car, just to the top of the lot). I quickly tossed my phone into the car and sprinted back into formation, and just in time. At 0658, \"Attention on Deck!” Out of breath and already beginning to sweat, but I made it! \n\nThe instructors came strolling out with coffee in hand. One breaks off left, another to the right, and the lead instructor began the 2 inch away stare. I'm at the end of a row and instructor 1 walks one step past me, paused, and walked backwards two steps. I could see him staring at me with an inquisitive look out of my peripheral vision. 30 seconds to a minute later, and he calls for the instructor 2 to come over. My eyes have long since seared holes into the back of the recruit's head in front of me. Instructor 2 walks and takes a mirrored pose to instructor 1. The two instructors begin whispering comments to each other... which I could still hear. \"Is he going to be alright?\" \"He might be having a heart attack\" \"It's only 85 degrees, it shouldn't be THAT hot outside\" \n\nAnd here comes the lead instructor (L.I.):\n\nL.I:   Ricky!\n\nMe:   Sir. \n\nL.I:   Ricky, are you ok!\n\nMe:   Sir, yes sir!\n\nL.I:   Because you are sweating.....heavily..\n\nMe:   Sir [L.I cuts me off]\n\nL.I:   Like heart attack sweating. Are you having a heart attack Ricky?\n\nMe:   Sir, no sir!\n\nL.I:   ....Blank stare and awkward silence....\n\nL.I:   Why are you sweating!?\n\nMe:   Hoping and praying they didn’t see me sprint past the door on the way to the parking lot, and trying not to cause another punishment workout, “Sir, I’m a heavy sweater, Sir!\" \n\nI could hear a couple snickers sneak out from the row behind me. I think the instructors were amused with the whole situation, they let the snickering slide. That was the day I truly understood the phrase, \"sweating like a pig.”\n\nCheers. ",

As a result, you're getting off easy.\" Here's one of those times.\n\nI stopped a car around the holidays,  in the middle of the day, for a registration violation. Upon contact, there was a mom driving, a dad in the front passenger seat, and a young kid in the back seat. As soon as the driver rolled down the window, I got a strong odor of alcohol coming out of the car. That means hand me the keys, which the driver did. I didn't see any impaired driving before I stopped them.\n\nI asked the driver for her driver's license. Didn't have one. I asked her for her ID. Nope, but she had a passport. The dad also provided his driver's license before I even asked for it. He explained, as I expected, \"I had a lot to drink last night, so she came to pick me up so I didn't drive drunk. I'm on probation for a DUI last year, but my license is valid right now.\"\n\nUsually when one person in the car has been drinking, more than one person in the car has been drinking, including the designated driver. So I had the mom exit and did some field sobriety tests. She wasn't impaired, so no DUI arrest here.\n\nI ran them all out in our system. Mom had a suspended driver's license for failing to pay for a prior ticket. Dad did have a valid driver's license. I walked back up and told them, \"Here's what's going to happen. Ma'am, you have a suspended driver's license, so you're getting a ticket for it. Sir, because the car is in your name, you're getting a correctable ticket for the expired registration. Because you did the right thing by trying to avoid driving drunk, the car is not getting impounded. Instead, sir, because your license is valid, if you blow into this machine and are under the legal limit, I'll let you drive it away.\"\n\nHe blew into the machine. Double the legal limit. Smart choice not to drive. They were required to park the car and have a friend with a valid license come and pick it up. They screwed up in three different ways, and they faced some consequences because of it. It could have been a lot worse, so they earned some leniency.\n\n(Side note: we stopped arresting people for driving while unlicensed, or while suspended because the local jails won't take them. They're too full. We impound the car instead since it solves the problem, at least temporarily.)",

Although I had the right of way, already being in the roundabout, the truck did not slow down and activated the yellow emergency lights trying to force entrance into the intersection. In turn, I activated the emergency lights and siren on the prisoner transport vehicle.\n\nAs I was slowing down to prevent a collision, I observed the tow truck braking violently, turning off its emergency lights then doing an illegal U-turn over the boulevard on Willard and speeding back in the direction it came from.\"",

Since then, I've been keeping a notebook, jotting down what I could remember and picking up a few new ones here and there in between taking calls.  They don't come very often and I don't like sharing lame material if I can help it, so it'll likely be quite a while before there's a part III.  Enjoy!\n\n*Background: My department is a small one. We've got less than 50 officers on patrol in our district, so we're tied into the city's dispatch system.

        "text": "I turned over the last page in the packet of crime scene and autopsy photos. As I passed it to the person to my right, I gave a quick, knowing nod as if I had found some clue in them that might help solve the case. I hadn’t, of course: I just found the gore intriguing. \n\n“We’ve identified a couple persons of interest at this point, but we’re still a bit unclear who the shooter was and what their motive might have been.” Biggs was running the show, reclined in a chair opposite of me at the large oval table. The murder had been messy and the family of the victim was still reeling to the point they couldn’t say if anything of value was missing from the house. \n\n“At this point, we’re guessing it was a robbery gone wrong but that’s just going by the small amount of weed we found at the scene. There wasn’t any cash recovered.” Biggs nodded to the crime scene tech who, in turn, nodded back in agreement. “We’re hoping when we start pulling people in there will still be fresh evidence on them or in their homes. The amount of blood and presence of latent evidence in it supports that hope.”\n\nThe overhead projector whirred to life as one of the other homicide detectives began messing with a keyboard. \n\n“Here are the first two we’ve ID’d. Mikhail Ochevsky is a local thug, has a history of robberies and drug sales. His vehicle was seen nearby and this is the wrong part of town for him to just be hanging out. Suspect two’s description matches Ochevsky’s partner in crime, Omar Yussef. The neighbor providing this info came out of his home to investigate when the shots started popping off and got a very clear view of this stupid tattoo” Biggs pointed to the mugshot of Yussef on the screen, “on Yussef’s left cheek as he ran to the car.”\n\nI chuckled to myself. I liked it when these idiots made it easy. \n\n“Ochevsky’s vehicle is then seen leaving the area. We think there was a third person driving since both subjects entered the passenger side. Our priorities are to ID the driver if possible, hoping he’s the weak link here, and then pop Yussef.” Biggs turned to me. “He’s yours now, EMR. He’s already wanted for a probation violation on drug charges.”\n\nI glanced at AJ, the only other guy from my unit in the room. I can only assume he was thinking what I was: thanks to a ruthless flu invading the office, he and I were the only two working that week. I grimaced to him but didn’t say anything to Biggs indicating my trepidation in operating with so few people. \n\nAfter a Q&amp;A session, the meeting broke. I approached Biggs and AJ joined me. “I’ll start working this guy up and AJ will go set up on a likely address. You just want us to grab him if we see him? You’re ready to interview him?” \n\n“Yeah, I guess. We need to start cracking into this thing at some point and he seems like the easiest option since he has paper already.”\n\n“Cool. It’s just the two of us,” I paused to see if that was going to change the preferred plan. It didn’t. “So we’ll be a little short. If we’re gifted a safe opportunity, we’ll take it.”\n\nBack at the office, AJ and I dug up Yussef’s last known address. “If you head there and get set up, I’ll do the case jacket work and see if there’s anything else worthy of our time.” AJ departed and I began digging into Yussef’s history. \n\nLike many of our prestigious clients, Yussef fancied himself an up and coming Rap artist. I labored through several poorly-shot “music videos,” hoping for a clue about where he might be putting his head down. Yussef seemed to prefer women of the larger variety and several made cameo appearances gyrating their hindquarters on various playground sets interspersed with Yussef’s terrible beats and lyrics. \n\nI hastily copied several links and sent them to Biggs with the subject line reading, “Let me know when you see it…” If I was torturing myself with the drivel, it was a bit of comfort reveling in some sweet, sweet schadenfreude as consolation. \n\nDigging further, I located Yussef’s brother in a police database. His criminal history was much cleaner than my target’s. It seemed the few times he had been stopped had been thanks to some stupidity on Yussef’s part. Digging a bit more, I saw he had recently moved out of his mom’s home and updated his address with DMV. The more I thought about the event, the more it made sense to me to change our plan. \n\n“AJ, you on the radio?” I keyed up my mic as I left the office. \n\n“Go ahead.”\n\n“I’m calling an audible. Let’s head to the brother’s new house. If I’m a drug dealer who was just involved in a robbery and homicide, I’m not going to stay at my normal address. I’m also not going to rely on couch hopping with my money hungry friends for fear they’ll drop a dime.”\n\n“Good call. Text the address and I’ll meet you there.”\n\nFifteen minutes later and we were idling outside the town home. The neighborhood was borderline rough, but just out of the way enough that a patrol officer wouldn’t necessarily recognize Yussef if he saw him walking on the sidewalk. \n\nHours passed slowly. I passed the time spitting sunflower seeds and playing games on my cell phone. AJ and I frequently reported movement in the house, but neither of us could get a good enough glimpse of the shadowy figures to say for sure they were our guy. \n\nRight after my bag of seeds ran dry, AJ piped up on the radio. “Got a white car is pulling up. Two door, I’ll read you the tag.” I ran it and it came back to a female who I didn’t recognize from my investigation. “Ok… younger male coming out. He’s got on a hoodie though, can’t see his face.”\n\nI mulled over our options. With just the two of us, rolling surveillance would be difficult, especially if this was Yussef and he was as paranoid as I assumed. On the other hand, two of us couldn’t approach the house either. We’d have to call in support from patrol and the street supervisors weren’t usually keen to that idea. \n\n“We’ll tail the car. Let’s try and get a good look at the passenger and make sure it’s our buddy. If we don’t get a good opportunity to take him on foot, we’ll call in patrol to light it up, cool?”\n\n“10-4. Sounds like a plan. They’re turning right on Sycamore. I’ve got the ball for now.”\n\nThe trip meandered through that part of the town with the target vehicle seeming to always be a step ahead of us. The driver would switch lanes at the last second to block our view of her passenger. Or she would make an overt U-turn in the middle of the road – a common tactic to throw off a tail. \n\n“Either she’s got a mental handicap or we’re blown.” AJ said glumly over the radio. We were driving back in the direction of Yussef’s brother’s house. \n\n“If they turn into the neighborhood off Sycamore, we’ll break it off. I’d rather come back another day and not get into a shooting or foot pursuit tonight.” I suggested. \n\nThe vehicle approached the turn but continued on past it. “Well, I guess we’re still on then?” AJ asked. \n\n“Yeah. Might as well at this point. In for a penny, in for a pound.”\n\nOur convoy of three approached a solid red and I saw the lane to the right of the white vehicle was open. I rolled down my window a crack and pulled to the side of them, trying to look casual. My first glance over made me realize I was too far back: the passenger seat was reclined behind the B-pillar. I leaned forward in my seat and pretended to examine the interior of my nostrils in my rear view mirror as I slowly inched my car forward. Another quick glance over and I could see the passenger’s head, covered in his hood. I cursed my luck but knew I shouldn’t back down. I probed my right nostril a bit with my index finger, still craning forward in my seat. After a few beats, I could feel the stares from the car next to me. I looked over, finger still in nose, and got a good view of a repulsed passenger – face still obscured in the shadow of his hood – with a disgusted expression planted on his face.\n\n“Well?” AJ asked when the light cycled green. \n\n“Not one hundred percent. Right age, right skin tone, grossed out by boogers…”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I couldn’t see the tattoo.” I concluded. “I think we stay on them though. If this isn’t him, it’s his brother and at least we can get an interview in.”\n\nWe continued on. \n\n“Vehicle is indicating a left turn into this shopping center.” AJ reported just as my phone rang. It was Biggs. \n\n“Hey man.” He started. “If you all don’t have anything, you can break it down. It’s been a rough few days working this and we’re all tired.”\n\n“Well,” I said, my voice straining a bit as I quickly parked and scanned the lot for the target car. “I think we have either Yussef or his brother. We’re in a shopping center now hoping to get the chance to confirm and grab him if so.”\n\n“Really? Oh, well in that –“\n\n“Vehicle’s coming out the ATM drive through.” AJ blurted out. \n\n“I see it.” I said. \n\n“Well if you-“ Biggs began. \n\n“Parking!” AJ said. \n\n“Still see it.” I said. \n\n“If it’s him you ca-“ \n\n“Passenger door is opening!” AJ called out. \n\n“Dude, I think-” I began to address Biggs.\n\n“Just grab him if that’s our boy. I’ll stand by.” Biggs hung up. \n\n“Hoodie is walking to the ATM vestibule.” AJ updated as I watched the same thing from my vantage. There was no one else inside the glass lobby of the bank. \n\n“Screw it.” I told him. “This is as good as it’ll get. I’m going in.” I pocketed a set of cuffs and patted my gun in its concealed holster. “Block that car and move in on my signal.”\n\nI crossed the lot on foot and entered the vestibule behind our hooded target. He was leaning on the wall with his left shoulder, muttering curses and bashing buttons on the machine. I sniffed and then gave a small cough, trying to catch his attention. He turned briefly, surprised by my proximity, and gave me a puzzled look. His stupid cheek tattoo was illuminated by the harsh fluorescent light. \n\nAJ had parked behind the female in the vehicle and was slowly approaching me, decked out in all his tactical gear. The girl noticed him and began exiting the vehicle. I quickly tried to get AJ’s attention and began jerking my head to indicate he should come inside. Yussef was still tapping away at the PIN pad, oblivious to the events unfolding around him. \n\n“Ma’am, stay in your car.” AJ’s muffled voice made it through the doors and Yussef looked up from the ATM. I stepped towards the door, ready to block him if he tried to make a run for it. AJ framed himself in the glass doors and grabbed the handles, setting his feet and nodding to me as if it was “go-time.” \n\nI shot a confused look at him. This wasn’t the plan I had envisioned. \n\nYussef turned, realizing there was a cop standing just outside the doors. I think he was as equally confused as me and his expression when we locked eyes confirmed it. An awkward pause passed before I shrugged and motioned towards AJ with a “check this weirdo out,” Vanna White pose. \n\nYussef began figuring out he was essentially trapped. AJ’s grip on the door handles was obvious by his posture. I had to take action. \n\n“Mr. Yussef, right?” I asked. \n\nHe was taken aback but said, “Yeah?”\n\n“Ok. You’ve got warrants.” I quickly spun him around and forearmed him into the wall, grabbing his right hand with mine and fishing the cuffs from my pocket. \n\n“What’s this for? What’d I do?” He protested, but didn’t resist. \n\n“Probation violation.” I responded, curtly. \n\nCuffs in place, AJ finally entered. He fist bumped me. “Good grab!” Then took control of the prisoner. \n\n“What was that?!?” I asked. \n\n“What?”\n\n“Holding the doors shut!”\n\n“Oh… I wanted to make sure that was him.”\n\n“I gave you the nod thing. Like, ‘this is him, come in and help.” \n\n“Oh!” He replied. “I thought that was the ‘hold the doors while I verify’ nod. My bad.”\n\n“We ‘have a hold the doors’ nod?” \n\n“I thought so?” \n\nExasperated, I exited and requested backup over the radio. Once Yussef was transported, I spoke with the driver. \n\n“You know Mr. Yussef well?” I asked. \n\n“Yeah.” She started. “Since elementary. We’ve dated on and off.”\n\n“What do you know about his criminal activity?” I fished. \n\n“Not much. He smokes weed. Mostly he thinks he’s the next Biggie Smalls.”\n\n“I’ve listened to some of his stuff-“\n\n“He needs to keep working on it, right?” She finished my thought for me. Then grew more serious. “Did you… were you wearing a ball cap earlier? Grey Under Armor?”\n\nI glanced to my cruiser, hoping my grey Under Armor hat was hidden. “No, why?” \n\n“I swear I saw you earlier. At a stop light… picking…”\n\n“Ha! Nope, wasn’t me. Alright guys!” I addressed AJ and the leftover backup units standing around. “I think we’re good here.”\n",

        "text": "I was patrolling on the freeway, as usual, when I saw a driver cut into a carpool/HOV/T2 lane. This particular lane also exited the freeway to allow you to bypass the freeway's congestion. What caught my eye was the driver cutting from the freeway, across a 10 foot divided section of the road, and take the carpool lane at the last possible second. I didn't know if the driver was violating carpool rules since I was too far back, but I did know she couldn't cut across the divided section of the road to take the exit. So I stopped her.\n\n\"Good afternoon, the reason I stopped you is...\" Now I was at the car and could see she didn't have the minimum two people in the car, although there was a dog in the right front seat. \"Well, I stopped you for two reasons. The first is cutting across the divided section of the road.\"\n\nShe replied, \"Oh, no, my dad said that was okay. I wouldn't have done it otherwise.\"\n\n\"Well he's wrong, that's not okay. The second reason is violating carpool. Your dog doesn't count as another person.\"\n\n\"No no no, I asked the DMV. They said it was okay and my dog counted.\"\n\nI had to pause at the ludicrousness of her statement. The DMV said her dog counted as another person for carpool? Was it a guide dog? A service dog? Wait, why am I even thinking she's remotely right?\n\n\"No, now you're just making things up. There's no way the DMV told you your dog allows you to drive in the carpool lane.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's what they said!\"\n\n\"Okay. Driver's license, registration, and insurance.\" She started looking for her information.\n\n\"Well, I'm pregnant, too, so that counts.\" Come on, lady.\n\n\"No, that doesn't count either. Any person in the car must occupy a separate seat for them to qualify...and no dogs.\"\n\nShe successfully retrieved her driver's license and registration. She seemed very confused on the last one. \"...insurance? What is that?\" I didn't even know how to begin to approach her level of confusion.\n\n\"You don't know what insurance is? If you're in a crash, the thing you exchange with other people. Or the company who pays to get your car fixed. Insurance...you're required to have it.\"\n\nShe fumbled through a lot of paperwork and was able to figure it out eventually. She received a verbal warning for crossing the divided section of the road, and a ticket for carpool. Then she asked, \"How much will it cost?\"\n\nI gave my standard answer, \"I have no idea.\" And that's mostly true; the courts provide the fine information and we never see it.\n\nShe pressed, \"You don't know? Some idea?\"\n\n\"No, we're not given that information.\"\n\n\"Come on, gun held to your head, have to answer.\" She just used the phrase \"gun held to your head\" to a uniformed law enforcement officer. I guess she really was that dumb.",

        "text": "So this happened about 12 years ago just outside of a major college town known for its drinking problem. I wasn't really a suspect, just in the company of idiots. \n\nApologies for grammar and consistency. I'm on my phone \n\nIn this story there are:\n\nWill- a Mexican guy who was the guy who  did one shot and lost his mind\n\nToby- just... he's toby. Leave it at that \n\nBen- a wrestler from another uni and Tobys friend. A really nice guy\n\nMe\n\nOfficer number one- big farm-bred good ol boy \n\nOfficer number two- Who bore a striking resemblence to Dave Chappelle \n\n\nI was 20 at the time, and worked in a bar. My three friends came in on a really slow night and had been drinking elsewhere. They convinced me to come with them back to Wills apartment to play Tiger Woods golf and drink. Right before we all left, Will ordered 9 O-bombs and my three friends all did 3 each. \n\nAs we're walking down the street, will picks up a recycling bin and throws it, screaming fuck you mother earth. \n\nOk... I say to myself, no drinking tonight. I was underage and did drink like most college kids did, but knew when not to, and this was definitely a night when I needn't intoxicate myself. \n\nWe got back to his apartment and Ben and Toby go out to smoke a cigarette and Will starts throwing stuff off the 4th story balcony up to and including the grill and sliding screen door. Soon the cars and parking lot are littered with broken beer bottles. \n\nBen and I try to convince him to stop, but he doesn't. Instead, he called me a Jew. (It's been the subject of much scholarly debate why, I'm not Jewish and neither is Ben) \n\n\"Dude, you know they're going to see all this tomorrow and know you're the one that did it because you're the only one missing a screen door\".  I said, as I watch a flicker of reason in Wills eyes. \n\nSo will and Toby go down to retrieve the door as Ben and I start to plan our exit. After 20 minutes go by we start to wonder why those two aren't back when all of a sudden Will comes busting through the door and a packed weed pipe and bag of weed fly across the room and land in my lap. I stood up quickly just in time to see two cops come in after him \n\n\"You don't have permission to be in here\" Will screams. Officer 1 says \"you opened the door!\". Will keeps repeating to get out when officer one starts the arm twist to handcuff. Will goes \"ahhhhh\" not unlike a child who yelps before the belt hits. Officer 1 says \"OK do you want this?\" And will says no and officer 2 pipes up and says everyone out in the hall. \n\nSo we go out in the hall and Tobys laughing and in the adrenalin rush of it all I'm trying not to look at him and laugh too. \n\nTurns out those two morons each had an end of the door and were smashing the florescent lights in the stairwell and the cops just calmly followed them up watching them do it. \n\nSo wills sat down and the rest of us are standing as the cop runs Wills ID and Tobys passport (he's british). \n\n\"So, what's your problem Billy\"- O1\n\"My names Will\"\n\"Ok, WILL, how much did you have to drink tonight?\" \n\"Three big beers (64 ounces if i remember) at reveres\" Will held his hands up to show him with fingers. \n\"You're holding up four fingers there, will\"\n\nWill looked at his hand, and used his other hand to bring down one finger. \"Three beers!\" He repeats. \n\nOfficer 2 administers a breathalyzer. We all watched the numbers as quiet, respectful Ben suddenly chirps \"wow! Watch it go!\" \n\n\"Shut up!\" O1 said while glaring at him. It reminded me sort of the scene in Rolling Kansas when that female deputy is searching the car \n\nO1, satisfied Wills BAC doesn't require hospitalization asks us if we always drink like that. Toby helpfully offers that we do as much as possible and gets called stupid. \n\nO1 then turns to me, and asks me for my name and birthday. He had trouble with my last name so I turned around and showed him the back of my softball shirt. \n\n\"I know your sister!!!\" O1 says to me \"we went on  dated in high school\" \n\n\"I can see why it didn't work out\". \n\nAs soon as I said it I expected that my non existent criminal record would now become existent. O2 put his head down and it was obvious he was suppressing a laugh. \n\n01 told me to come with him. My heart raced. We went down the hall and he asked me \"Why are you here. Why are you with these people. They're just going to get you in trouble. Have you been drinking?\" \n\nI told him I had not, and he said ok go back over there. \n\nThe two officers then lectured us about being stupid, told us we were done for the night, they would give the report to the apartment office in the morning and they had better not come out. Make better choices etc. \n\nAfter they left we all started laughing and Toby said that they were \"serious fucking dicks\"\n\n\"Actually\" Ben sagely observed \"they were actually really cool\" \n\nEpilogue- \n\nWill was evicted as this was his 4th incident \n\nI asked my sister about dating the officer. She was very surprised he became a cop.",

        "text": "The day I graduated from the Academy, one of the Troopers in charge gave me one last piece of advice as he was giving me the bullets to my gun: \"Don't ever go into North Madison alone.\" North Madison, historically, had some of the highest crime rates in the country, but had been steadily declining. Still not a place anyone who earns a legal paycheck would like to live.\n\nYears later, I got a call to take a report of a hit and run crash in North Madison. I had never been to North Madison before, but I remembered what the instructor told me. It was just a hit and run crash, with a female reporting party, no need for a second unit...even though the nearest backup would be 30 minutes out.\n\nI went on scene and realized I wasn't in the Projects; I patrolled another city with literal projects, and that area was bad. I was in an area worse than the Projects.  No windows on any houses as they were all covered with boards. The outside walls of the houses were halfway ripped off, exposing the structure. They all looked like they should've been condemned. Yet people were living in them.\n\nI contacted the \"victim,\" Jane. She was seated in the driver's seat of a brand new bright orange Toyota Corolla. She bought it five days prior. And on the left side was a giant scrape and dent, running the length of the car. That car was obviously in a crash. I asked for her driver's license to identify her. It was suspended, and she only had an ID card. She told me she absolutely wasn't driving, as her car was simply parked, and she happened to be in the driver's seat when the crash happened. And she knew exactly who did it, and exactly which car they were driving, and exactly where that person lived, although she only knew the other driver's street name of Pixie. And I didn't believe a word she told me.\n\nThe whole time this was going on, there was a small group of guys sitting on the trunk of another car, about 50 feet away, watching me. I was watching them as well. They gave me one of those bad feelings. One of them in particular stood out to me, which I later learned was Jane's boyfriend.\n\nI got all the info on the report, and left to do some follow up at the address the victim provided. I got there, and a teenager answered the door. I told him, \"I'm Trooper 2BlueZebras, I'm looking for....\" People don't talk to cops in these neighborhoods, so I was surprised when he replied, \"Oh yeah! You looking for Pixie about the crash? HEY PIXIE!! YOU HERE?! HEY, IS PIXIE HERE?!\" Pixie wasn't there, but I left my contact info, fully expecting no reply.\n\nTwo days later, I went into work like normal and we had a briefing. We watched a pursuit video from one of our airplanes in Madison with a random car, which we do from time to time for training purposes. The suspect went head on with an innocent car, flipping over the innocent car, and totaling the suspect car. The suspect tried to flee on foot, and you could see him take a couple steps, then fall over. The graveyard shift arrested the driver and impounded the car, which is standard. Follow up determined he broke his leg in the crash and couldn't run.\n\nThat afternoon, I got a call at the office from Pixie. Her story was quite a bit different. She goes on about how she was the real victim, and Jane, who owned that Corolla, wasn't the one in it, and it definitely wasn't parked. In fact, Jane's boyfriend was the one driving it, and he was trying to kill Pixie, and Pixie was being chased all over Madison until she was finally able to get away. It wasn't a hit and run, it was an attempted murder with a car. Pixie told me that she heard that Jane's boyfriend was arrested last night, after a pursuit in that same orange Corolla...that same orange Corolla that I just watched a pursuit video of in briefing.\n\nThe pieces started to come together. I believed Pixie's story a lot more than Jane's. The pursuit video I watched was actually the Sheriff who had been following Jane's boyfriend for weeks. He had multiple warrants for multiple murders. Jane's boyfriend was one of the guys in North Madison watching me as I was taking the report. Jane even showed up to the pursuit crash scene to get her belongings out of the car before it was towed.\n\nAt the end of it all, Jane's boyfriend broke his leg and went to prison (again). Jane had her brand new car totaled with no compensation from insurance. And I never went to North Madison alone again.",

        "text": "I work 12 hour shifts. I had sat in the office for the first 6 hours due to a giant mess of paperwork I picked up the day before. I was getting a bit of cabin fever, so I headed out to do some patrol.\n\nAs I was pulling out into the street from my office's parking lot, I spotted a guy using his cell phone while driving (illegal). I stopped him. He got a ticket. I also noted that he had two toddlers in his back seat, which makes his distracted driving all the more frustrating.\n\nAfter I finished writing his ticket, I pulled back into traffic, and the car directly in front of me had expired registration. I stopped her. She said her husband had paid it. I ran it through the state's system, and she was right. But it was pending an emissions check...for the past 6 months. So she got a ticket.\n\nImmediately after clearing that stop, I went a block down the road and jumped on the freeway. As I was merging on, a black SUV went flying by me. I was up to the speed limit as it passed me, and I was driving a fully marked patrol car. I matched his speed; 83 in a 55. I stopped him. He told me if he got another ticket he'd be fired. I told him he probably should've slowed down. He got a ticket.\n\nImmediately after stopping him, I took the next exit on the freeway and went the other way. As I moved into the fast lane, I saw a car ahead of me that was absolutely flying through traffic, in and out of lanes. I accelerated to catch up, still in a 55mph zone. I had to seriously push to catch up to it as it was a curved section of the freeway, hence the slower speed limit. I paced it at 93mph. I stopped her. She told me it was her brother's car and she \"kind of lost control of it.\" She got a ticket.\n\nI wasn't out actively looking for tickets. I was just driving normally, seeing if anything came up. In the span of about 20 minutes I wrote 4 tickets without even trying to find anything to write.\n\nWe don't have quotas. I can write as few or as many tickets as I want. But there's also no reason for me to have a quota when there's so many drivers egregiously ignoring the laws.",

So Chuck is notorious for shoving everything and anything inside of his penis and anus. So because of this he gets hand fed, we watch him wipe his ass, and he gets absolutely NOTHING!\n\nChuck is on a system where if he shows signs of improvement,  he can earn back privileges and recently he's been doing good. Taking his medication and not screaming at us. \n\nSo on Friday during  briefing we were given notice that Chuck will be actually getting some clothes. We were all happy for him and hoped he continued to do will in regards to his privileges.\n\nSo I grab his clothes after briefing which includes socks, shoes,  shirt and pants. So I bring these items down to his lonely little isolates cell and I set them down on the table. \n\n\"Good morning Chuck!  Looks like today you'll be getting some clothes and what not. Now you know how this works, you do anything not appropriate with these items and you lose them.  That's final.\"\n\n\"Yea CO I understand.\" \n\n\"Okay then Chuck, here you go.\"\n\nI handed him the items and let him get dressed.  Now something to note is our shoes are orange rubber sandals, of which can be destroyed fairly easy.\n\nAs i make my round about 25 minutes later I check in on Chuck.\n\n\"Chuck how's it going? \"\n\nIn a chocked voice \"I can't breathe CO.\"\n\n\"Why's that Chuck?\"\n\n\"I ate my shoe!\"\n\n\"...well why the fuck did you do that?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's stuck in my throat and there's some in my penis as well.\"\n\n\"Why? Why did you stick it up you urethra?\" \n\"I don't know CO.\"\nSo I told him to show me his shoe and open his mouth. The whole top half of his shoe was torn apart like a dog had gotten a hold of it. He did have half a piece of it lodged in his throat which he later managed to swallow. As for his pecker, he went to the ER to get it removed. Chuck is now back to his suicide smock and blanket. Sorry for the poor grammar and all that. I did this off my phone.",

        "text": "So this was about 10 years ago when I was 19 and dumb. I had a 98 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP which had a supercharged V6 and about 240 hp and close to 290 torque. Not huge but the thing hauled ass, and its wide track meant that for a big boat of a GM sedan, it handled like a BMW. At the time, I routinely commuted up and down I-5 in Sacramento between Elk Grove and downtown. I5 is awful straight going north until you pass a big water tower. Then it gets somewhat curvy. The CHP *loves* to set speed traps right at Pocket/Meadowview Rd because as you crest the hill going Northbound you cannot see them until they already have you nailed. I knew this and would routinely slow down there and then speed up after the trap. I got so used to this I could tell which cop was on duty. \n\nWell, this one lady cop on a CHP bike (the BMW ones) figured out my little scheme, and one day in mid December 2006 she followed me at enough distance that I didn't see her. She waited until I sped up again and pulled me over. I was doing 80-85 while the rest of traffic was going 70-75 in a 65 zone, so I wasn't *terribly* excessive, but I was weaving through cars in the two inside lanes and not leaving a ton of room. She gave me the whole lecture about my driving behavior and gave me a ticket. \n\nFast forward to NYE, December 31, 2006. My GF (now ex) took *forever* to get ready as usual so we were late for this big party we were going to. We were both dressed up a bit, and because its a holiday, there was a lot of people headed downtown. We had been arguing about how long it had taken her to get ready and how late that made us, so I was a little mad and driving faster than my version of normal. I was probably doing 90-95 in the same conditions as before, only this time it was dark out and while traffic around me was doing 75, there were simply more cars and the gaps to weave between were tiny (keep in mind this car was a boat). My girl is simultaneously nervous about my speed but having fun with it. With all of that considered, I still cannot believe this officer put herself in this much danger to catch me, but when she exploded through a 2.5 foot gap behind me with lights on, I was surprised to say the least. We pull to the side and she is pissed. Fuming. \n\nLEO: Do you know how fast you were going?!\n\nme (being a snarky teenager): yes... :)\n\nLEO: This isnt funny younggggggg..... HEY! DIDN'T I PULL YOU OVER DOING THIS SAME SHIT A FEW WEEKS AGO?!?!\n\nme: hehehhhhh, uhhh, yes ma'am. I'm reaaaallly sorr..\n\nLEO: I HAD TO SPLIT LANES IN TIGHT TRAFFIC DOING A BUCK TWENTY FIVE JUST TO CATCH UP WITH YOU!!!!\n\nme: ehhhh I'm real sorry ma'am. We're late to a party.\n\nOfficer proceeds to chew me out for a second more, and as I'm handing back the signed citation some ricer comes flying by in the somehow-empty slow lane doing at least 100. She threw my yellow slip back thru the window and was on the bike and after this dude before I could roll my window up. I'm still to this day blown away that this lady risked life and limb splitting lanes that fast to catch me.\n\nSuffice to say I learned my lesson, and now I have a truck which isn't fun to drive much above 80. So to all the LEOs, sorry for being a jackass. Stay safe out there.",

        "text": "It was raining, and we had a lot of cars spinning out all over the area. One car needed help getting turned around to face the right direction; he spun out onto the shoulder around a blind curve. Once he was righted, he told me, \"There's something on the road that's making it really slippery.\" I replied, \"Yes sir. It's called water.\"\n__________\n\nI watched a driver make a lane change from the fast lane across three lanes to take an exit at the last second. No turn signal. \"Good afternoon. The reason I stopped you was for that unsafe lane change, three lanes at once.\" He was about 55 and had probably been driving for 40 years. He asked, \"So, I guess, the correct way to do it would be one lane at a time?\" \"...that would be correct, sir.\"\n__________\n\nI watched a crash happen right in front of me while I was on patrol. Six vehicles, blocking four lanes. It was actually pretty bad. I walked up to one woman on her cell phone right as she got out of her car. \"Ma'am, are you hurt?\" She replied, \"I'm on the phone with 911!\" To which I replied, \"I am 911!\"\n__________\n\nI stopped a guy for speeding, 25mph over the limit. After he was issued his ticket he asked, \"I understand I was going too fast, but 5 over the speed limit is okay, right?\" He basically asked me what level of speeding is okay. \"Well, I can't advocate speeding at any level, but when you're passing everyone else, it's a good indicator that you're going too fast.\"\n____________\n\nI stopped a guy for running a red light. My state has correctable tickets (fix something and the ticket goes away) and moving violations (goes on your driving record). He got his ticket and asked, \"Is this a moving violation?\" I told him, \"I'm not sure, but since you had to be moving to commit the violation, I'm going to say probably.\"\n__________\n\nI went to a crash with injuries. I spoke to the guy who caused it all, and he was hammered drunk. Couldn't stand up at all, slurring his words like crazy, and he stunk like alcohol. He ended up testing at 3x the legal limit. An ambulance was also on scene. While I was talking to the drunk guy, the paramedic whispered to me, just so I'd be aware, \"I think he might have had something to drink.\"\n__________\n\nI stopped a driver for not having license plates. \"Ma'am, I need to see your driver's license.\" \"I have an ID.\" \"...Okay? An ID is not a driver's license.\" She didn't have a driver's license.",

My job was basically to babysit the contractors and make sure they were installing components properly and that they had access only to authorized areas.\n\nI totally didn't mind spending my shifts this way, because I was allowed to work plainclothes.  The only \"duty\" item visible on me was my radio, so I kind of blended in with the other guys.\n\nOne day while the contractors were puttering around doing their thing, I was tasked with getting access to a door for them.  The boss popped in to check in with me.\n\nNow, mind you at the time I knew very little about my boss.  He wasn't exactly an imposing figure, but he was a bit intimidating nonetheless.  His speech was super distinctive for the area-- a soft, slow southern drawl that dripped with class.\n\n\"Hey 8million, how's it goin' here now?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's going fine sir, I'm having trouble finding the key to this door though.\"\n\nBefore he could respond, an office administrator burst through the door.  I'd heard from other officers before today that she was a bit of a busy-body, always minding everyone's business but her own.\n\n\"YOU GUYS CAN'T BE HERE!\"\n\nThe contractors, my boss and I all turned and looked silently at her.  My boss stepped forward, hand extended with a warm smile.\n\n\"Now, now miss, we're jus' doin' a bit-o' installation fuh' this heah doe an--\"\n\n\"STOP!

        "text": "Been lurking here since I discovered this sub a couple weeks ago, and I've noticed mention of the ridealong curse, so wanted to mention a couple of my interesting rides. Hopefully not super rambly and in a format that's interesting to read. For Full Disclosure though I was able to cheat, and while in High School dated the niece of an Officer in a small town I would ride with every weekend night I could.\n\nThe first story is probably not that special to you Officers, but for me it was awesome, my first pursuit. Being a small town night shift, Officer I rode with was shift supervisor, so I was unofficial, and he had no restrictions on if he could run code or anything. \n\nIt was late, somewhere in the realm of 1 AM when we were headed to the only open gas station for something to drink. It'd been a slow Saturday night, and we'd almost resigned to head back to the station and watch TV when he abruptly braked and flicked off his headlights with the Gas Station in site. A truck parked at the pump, he explained, belonged to someone he knew was suspended (Small town perks?) for DUI, and we were going to wait and see who was driving. Sure enough, Suspended Man gets in and drives off, so we fall behind. Officer calls it in, lights him up, and dude takes off. The black smoke pouring out of his tailpipe and Officers \"hah!\" immediately got my adrenaline flowing, and the siren only helped that. Guy was pretty obviously drunk, and the pursuit didn't last long, he headed away from town, and after a few curvy turns ran straight into a pine tree. He foot bailed and Officer chased him into the woods, which was actually pretty scary as I was ordered to stay put, and I had no idea where back up was. Officer won though, and dragged Pine Man out of the woods, covered in pine needles. \n\nAfter that night I always hoped for pursuits, but most nights were fairly uneventful. Until the next summer.\n\nIt was another Saturday night, and again had been pretty uneventful until 1130 when we were cruising around on the town's buypass looking for trouble. An older Cadillac turned left out of a parking lot, across all 4 lanes, a wide median, and into the opposite ditch before regaining the road. DUI, Officer hoped, so we did a U-Turn and went to initiate a traffic stop.\n\nAgain, the black smoke pouring out of the tailpipe immediately got my adrenaline going, as what I hoped would happen, happened, the guy took off. We again headed out of town, which apparently is the plan in small towns to get away from the Police, and Officer called a day Officer's cell and told him we had a pursuit coming his way (Another small town perk?), and to get dressed and meet us.\n\nThe pursuit didn't make it long again, but it was a good bit crazier then the last one. Until this point I'd never seen a car turn almost completely sideways in a turn, but still somehow keep the road. He only managed that a couple of times though before he too, met a pine tree, which is how all pursuits may end in small towns. This time though there was the added bonus of a fire. It didn't explode like in the movies, just a few pops, but the main problem Officer had now was that there were 4 people in the car, and he was alone. I'd never heard Officer yell like he did before, threatening he'd shoot them, hands, get out, etc, all important things to get everyone out of a burning car, but it worked. Backup arrived shortly after that, everyone was cuffed and separated, and I was given one to guard in front of Officers Crown Vic. With the words \"Stay with this Officer\" coming out of Officer's mouth I puffed up my chest and attempted to stand there authoritatively and Officer-like, until the dudes pants fell down. He was crying, explaining he was asleep in the back, it was his girlfriend's car and his life was going to end when she found out, and could I please pull up his pants. I did, it sucked, but I was just glad there wasn't any fluids. We actually had to sit there for about 2 hours as Chief wanted a Trooper to come write a report as the car completely burned before the FD could get it out.\n\nBy the time the Trooper left and we went to County to hang out with them after as we figured nothing else could happen at 3 AM that night, a vehicle vs pedestrian was broadcast by dispatch, way out in the county. Since we had nothing better to do, we ran code with county. The trip was awesome, it was almost into the next county, and we were running about 120 mph when I glanced over, as the only thing we had to worry about were deer. We were actually first on scene, and the car was off into the ditch, noticeable dent in the hood and the windshield was shattered. I stayed in the car, and Officer checked on the driver, who witnesses had stopped to help (She had glass in her face from the window I think), and then he went over to a body I hadn't noticed on the shoulder. He touched him briefly, to check for a pulse he explained later, then got a sheet from his car and covered him up. I'd just seen my first dead body. His partner came over to get a flashlight that was built into the center console on my left and grabbed my leg not noticing I was there, so incidentally, was also the first time I was felt up by a cop.\n\nMedics arrived and I believe he was pronounced dead then and there, but I'm not sure. The medics were both women, so Officer and a Deputy offered to pick him up and place him on the gurney to get him in the ambulance for transport. When Officer went to pick up his legs, they lifted straight up and bent impossibly, nothing else moved. That was more jarring than seeing the actual body, his legs were apparently pretty horribly broken. It was assumed he was drunk (This was confirmed later), and he had a name like a popular Beer, which the Officers on scene found hilarious, and I got to witness the morbid humor first hand. \n\nAfter that it was pretty uneventful, the Trooper was still in the area and showed up, and was extra pissed we let the witnesses continue on. By the time everything was all done from that scene, it was 6 AM and shift was almost over, so we went and ate breakfast, and that was that. Officer did ask and make sure I was good after what I saw (I was) and such over scrambled eggs and coffee.\n\nWow that was, probably twice as long and half as interesting as I meant for it to be, but hopefully someone enjoys reading.\n\nTL;DR: Wasn't entirely plagued by Ridealong Curse, saw some neat stuff.",

        "text": "“I found her.” I collapsed into the spare office chair in the common area. Everyone stopped chewing their breakfast burritos and turned to me. “Maya Jackson: I found her.”\n\n“Who’s she?” Lt asked around a mouthful of eggs. Everyone else just gave puzzled looks to each other. \n\n“Seriously?” I was shocked no one else seemed to be as all-consumed by my latest case. “Maya Jackson… as in ‘MJ’… the new girlfriend of Jenkins… nobody?!?”\n\n“Jenkins?” Lt had taken another bite so his question was still obstructed. \n\n“Jesus! The shooter? From Southside? Do you guys not follow the daily report?!”\n\n“Oh yeah. You talking about the shooting from the other night?” AJ piped up. He had finished his meal while I had been recovering from my shock.\n\n“Yes, exactly. A witness mentioned a girlfriend, ‘MJ’, and they included it in the brief. They got warrants last night for Jenkins. But I tracked her down!” The hard pause between my excited announcement and the realization no one really cared seemed to take an eternity. It hurt a bit too. “Whatever. When you dummies are done stuffing your faces, let’s go sit on her house. This guy’s on scumbag time, he won’t be up for another couple hours.”\n\nAs I was gathering my case file, Greg strolled into my office. “How’d you get her?” \n\nI was glad someone finally wanted to hear an account of my triumph. “Pain in the ass, actually. I ran the dude through a few databases. I found his last house before he went homeless a year ago and ran an ‘All Residents’ check on it. I then found another dude that stayed there around the same time. Luckily, he had a ridiculous name. Also lucky he was stupid enough to use it on Facebook. When I found his profile, I tracked down Jenkins’ profile in his friends. Of course he’s known as ‘J-Money Killah’ so I never would’ve found him. Numb nuts was nice enough to keep his content fresh for us and I noticed the last three photos on his timeline were liked by the same girl: ‘Babee Ma.’ Going through her profile, I saw a good number of her friends had the same last name: Jackson. I thought I was onto something because of the ‘J’ in ‘MJ’ so I ran a loose search with Jackson as the last name, M with a wildcard as first, and a general age range based on her graduation picture from last year. I finally tracked down Maya Jackson, from a runaway report several years ago, and compared her DMV photo to the Facebook picture. Bing, bam, boom, I hit it outa the park! Popped her info into utilities and got a new address!”\n\nGreg nodded his head. “Cool.” He muttered before turning on his heel and exiting. I sighed in defeat. \n\nTwenty minutes later we were making our perimeter around Maya’s house. I took the low end while Greg positioned up the hill from the home and Martin and AJ took an outer position to serve as point if we had someone leave in a car. The first hour was dead. Martin finally piped up on the radio.\n\n“So how’d we end up here anyway, EMR?” \n\nI gave myself a smug smirk of satisfaction before picking up the mic. My attempt to key up was met with a busy tone however.\n\n“Big mistake, Martin: don’t ask.” Greg said. “He’ll be on the air for ten minutes.”\n\n“Whatever. At least I keep tabs on wha- GUY COMING OUT!”\n\n“I got him.” Greg said. “Black male, looks about the right height and weight. Jeans, blue hoodie… I can’t see his face.”\n\n“Me neither.” I told the crew. I peered through the binoculars, hoping for something more. “I got dreads! Feeling good about this – no other males are supposed to be at this residence.”\n\nThe guy looked up as an older Toyota van pulled up to the house. “Got a car now… Whiskey thirty four Zebra Mary one. Dude’s heading to it, getting in the passenger seat. This could make sense guys – spent the night at his girl’s place and now he’s gonna go wreck some more lives.”\n\nThe van kept rolling away from me, up the hill. “Greg, the eye’s going to be yours. Coming up!”\n\nA few tense moments passed as the van puttered up the hill. “I’m at seventy five percent on the ID. Dude had a goatee like our buddy but still had his hood up.”\n\n“Crap… go ahead and follow him. Martin - try to get another spot on the passenger. I’ll stay here until you guys are certain.” \n\nA minute later, Martin spoke up. “Dude. I’m not at one hundred, but I’m bumping Greg’s seventy five up to an eighty. This guy is acting nervous.”\n\nIt was enough for me. “I’m peeling off. AJ: try and catch up. Martin and Greg: let us know where you are until we get to you.”\n\n“Turning South on Third.” \n\nI gunned my engine between stop signs. I knew this stop could be messy. \n\n“Left on G Street.” Greg updated. \n\n“I’m going to parallel on H.” Martin said. \n\nI told Greg, “I’m almost to you. I think I can see your tail lights.”\n\n“This guy is nervous as hell, man.” Greg replied. He’s looking all over the place.” \n\n“You burnt?” \n\n“No way, he’d have to be psychic.” Greg was confident. \n\n“Well, I’m one car back in case they do anything stupid now. Martin, where are you?” \n\nThere was an aggravated sigh over the radio. “They decided today would be a good day to shut down H Street for paving. I’m trying to catch up.” There was radio silence for a bit as we continued down the road.\n\nThen, “Right turn signal is on… nope, signaled right but turning left, I think they’re trying to shake us.” The tension was mounting in Greg’s voice. “I’ve got to bypass or else they’ll realize I pulled the same stupid maneuver.”\n\n“Make the next turn to catch back up, I’ll take lead.” Greg kept straight and I turned with the target vehicle. A soon as I was behind, I saw the same thing the others had noted. The passenger was nervously scanning the area, going so far as to sit up in his seat and look back at me. \n\n“Looks like they’re slowing, Greg. We might have a bail out here in a second.”\n\n“I’m at the stop sign just ahead of you.” I saw his undercover vehicle ahead, backed off the stop sign a few feet as though it was parked. “I’ll pull in behind you if they keep straight.”\n\nThe vehicle did continue on, and Greg pulled behind me. “And we have brake lights… Martin, AJ, if you can get here quick we’re probably going to need you.”\n\n“Still stuck in backup from this damned construction.” Martin barked. \n\n“I’m trying to get there but it’s slow going, want me to run code?” AJ asked.\n\n“Hold off on that. We’ll put it out if it’s a foot pursuit. Car’s stopping in from of 221 River Street. I’m going to swing around for a front block, ok Greg?”\n\n“Copy.”\n\nI flicked on my lights and jerked the wheel to the left, overtaking the target car before cutting it back hard to the right, angled to the curb so the car couldn’t flee. The passenger door flew open as I threw my car in park and exited my door. Greg’s lights were on now too and he got in close to the rear bumper to close off another escape route. The van’s engine roared to life and the fearful driver locked eyes with me before jamming down on the gas and peeling out backwards, directly into Greg’s car. \n\n“Shit!” He yelled, and dove to the side. \n\nI drew my gun and leveled it at the driver. “Stop! POLICE!! Stop the car, NOW!”\n\nHer hands shot up in the air and she stared at me, wide eyed with fear and at an odd angle thanks to her perch atop Greg’s hood. I glanced at the passenger, who looked equally as fearful.\n\n“Hands! SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!” I ordered the pair. They both complied immediately. I took another look at the passenger. “Greg… it’s not our guy.” \n\nGreg was recovering and now had his gun out as well. “What? Really?” \n\n“Nope. This dude’s older.” I began holstering up, the scene seemed stabilized. “Ok, driver? I’m going to need you to pull forward slowly, come down off the officer’s car, ok?”\n\nThe driver rolled down her window. “I’m sorry! It was a mistake, I thought you were going to hit me and I didn’t know what to do!” She was shaking with the drop in adrenaline in her system. \n\n“It’s ok, no one’s hurt. I just want to get the two cars apart, nice and slow, and then we’ll work this out.” The van squealed with a metal-on-metal grind as the woman eased her car back to terra firma. Greg’s car began dumping fluids and the acrid smell of burnt coolant tinged the thick smoke pouring out of the crumpled hood. He looked like he might cry.\n\n“I’ve… I’ve gotta call Lt.” He mumbled. \n\nI went to explain the scenario to the driver and not-our-target passenger. “You just picked this guy up, right? Well there’s a dude wanted for a shooting that we think is staying at that house. I was hoping-”\n\nThe woman looked pissed. “You’re telling me you made me crash my car ‘cause you thought he was J-Money?!?!” She glared at her passenger. “Oh, hell nah, you’ll be talking to my attorney. I know how this works. I’m ‘bouta get paid”\n\n“So then you know the subject I’m talking about?” I asked, ignoring the sudden drop in social temperature. \n\n“Nah, screw y’all po-leece. I aint talking to nobody, ain’t answering no more questions. I’m pleasing the fifth!” She crossed her arms in defiance, the last sign of transition from her previous mode of apology and taking blame to full on rage mode. I guess with a lack of adrenaline also comes a lack of responsibility. The passenger waved me over when the driver was distracted inspecting the damage. \n\n“This dude’s in there, sleeping with Maya in the back room. I seen him before I left.” He whispered so as not to be heard by the driver. I thanked him and jumped on my radio. \n\n“Martin, forget coming here: Greg’s car is totaled and this isn’t our guy. Head back to the house, he’s there in a back room.” \n\n“Roger that, I’ll be there in two.”\n\n“You good Greg?” I called back.\n\n“Yeah.” He was pissed, it was plain to see, but knew he wasn’t going anywhere any time soon. “You go ahead and get back there, Lt will be here in a little while.” \n\nI started my car and began to pull off when the driver began yelling and stomping her foot in the road. I assume she was angry I was leaving the scene, since I did ‘make her throw her car in reverse and slam into a police car with its lights on’ after all. I saw Greg take the opportunity to vent some rage and figured I’d be better served back at the house then getting stuck in the middle of a screaming match. \n\nWhile in transit, Martin got on the radio. “I’m here. Just got set up and a guy just came out. What’s your ETA, EMR?”\n\n“Two or three minutes. Is it our guy?” \n\n“I’m gun shy after my eighty percent call but I think this is him. I’m going to tail him for a bit until you get here.”\n\nI pushed through traffic and made it to the area in record time. Martin was stationary in an office building parking lot, watching the new target who was sitting alone at a bus stop. “I’m going to do a drive by real quick, see what he looks like up close.” I informed him. \n\nI passed the seated figure and felt confident it was Jenkins. Martin and I quickly came up with a plan and approached him from two angles, careful of our cross fire, and took him into custody without a fight. After he was cuffed, I asked him where he came from, just to shore up my intelligence gathering from earlier. \n\n“Man, y’all know I came from Maya’s: you stopped Bucky and Marge over by Ray-Ray’s place. He called me ten minutes ago saying you were looking for me.”\n\n“How… they didn’t…” I was dumbfounded. “Neither of them made any calls...” \n\n“Pssh, the streets be talking, man. Don’t need no cell phone to know what’s up.”\n\n“Well, why didn’t you run then?” I asked. \n\n“Shit. I didn’t need you all crashing into my ass like you did Marge. Apparently y’all taking this seriously.”\n\nI nodded and shrugged my shoulders in approval of his assessment. It didn’t hurt to have a bit of crazy on your resume while dealing with his sort.\n\n“Besides, jail’s a lot safer for me. Marge is gonna beat my ass when she sees me next. It’s gonna be my fault y’all wrecked her car, watch.” Having just dealt with her, I could only nod my head in solidarity.\n\n“You might want to push out this trial a while,” I suggested. “She seemed a little pissed.”\n",

        "text": "I was working an area with a lot of freeway interchanges. At one point 4 freeways came together, which has approximately 10 connectors from one freeway to another in all the various directions. To make matters worse, the freeway directions don't match cardinal directions. A freeway designated eastbound was heading north according to the compass. The result of this madness is that if people can't see an exit sign, then they have no idea where they are, or even what direction they're traveling.\n\nThere was a call of a motorcycle down with the rider apparently injured. Every time there's a motorcycle crash, we automatically start an ambulance. That's the nature of motorcycle crashes. \n\nThe location was put out as eastbound I-20, west of Kentucky Street. I went through that area. Unable to locate. Another unit went through the westbound direction near Kentucky Street. Unable to locate. I went through the eastbound and westbound directions of the other connecting freeway. Unable to locate. It was rush hour, so even with my lights and sirens, it took me 30 minutes to do this. And after 30 minutes, we only had one call, so we cancelled our response. The firefighters couldn't find it, and the ambulance couldn't find it. Many times we'll get a crash where the people exchange information and continue on, which is why we can't find it.\n\nAbout five minutes after cancelling, we got a second call from someone involved in the crash. They added that they were actually not yet to Kentucky Street, and weren't really sure what freeway they were on, but were definitely in the area.\n\nSo I tried a couple other connectors. They said they were eastbound, but they were obviously wrong, so I went from a northbound connector that split west and east. As I approached the split, I still didn't have a visual of any sort of backed up traffic or stopped cars in unusual places. I had a 50/50 shot; west or east. I went east.\n\nAnd 40 minutes after the original call, I finally found the downed rider, along with two other vehicles stopped. The rider was still on the ground when I showed up. The rider didn't have life-threatening injuries, but I'm pretty sure his leg was broken.\n\nOne of the stopped drivers came up to me and explained why they were so far off with their location; \"Someone else saw it happen and stopped to help. They called 9-1-1 and then left. When no one showed up, I decided to call.\" \n\nIf I had been given the correct location, my response time would've been five minutes. And if they rider had internal bleeding, the difference between a five minute response and a 40 minute response is huge. Always know where you are. In 40 minutes, during rush hour, with a man laying on the ground of a freeway, *two people* called it in. Hundreds had to have passed them. If you see something, call it in.\n\n",

        "text": "I signed up for an overtime detail working an extra beat on a Saturday night, midnight to 4am. It was just to cover short staffing, with the expectation that the only thing I'd be doing was driving in circles or parked in a visible spot. We wanted people to see a law enforcement presence and act accordingly. If I came across something egregious I'd handle it, but otherwise I was just putting miles on a car. I was scheduled to do it on my own, until another guy, Anderson, signed up for the same shift and partnered with me.  Just putting miles on a car is not what we did.\n\nIt started with tickets. We're Troopers, so tickets are common. But Anderson was known in the office for loving writing tickets. His threshold was 11 over the posted limit...which is 90% of the traffic in our area. He had two under his belt within the first 10 minutes. He asked me if I wanted to write any. I declined.\n\nThen we got a call from the local agency requesting assistance with a drunk driver arrest. They needed someone to operate the testing machine. Somehow, I ended up being the only Trooper on shift certified to do that, so we went to the jail and assisted.\n\nAfter that was done, we headed just past the edge of our area and turned around. While doing so, we came across a car crashed into a wall just past the on ramp. Airbags were deployed, but no one was in or around it. Anyone working the road for more than 6 months could tell you what happened: drunk driver. Luckily, they only damaged their own car. We called the neighboring station, and they sent over a couple Troopers to deal with it.\n\nWe started heading back when we reached an area with road construction with a Trooper on duty there. The freeway shut down from 4 lanes to 1. Our car also happened to be equipped with a license plate reader. Whether you're for or against these is besides the point of this story; they identify stolen cars about 100 times more effectively than we can. So we parked next to the construction, scanning all the cars that went by, waiting for a stolen one. We were only there for five minutes when we got a hit. We pulled out behind it, and I ran the plate on our computer. That gives dispatch an immediate notification if it returns stolen.\n\n“Dispatch to Unit 10?”\n\n“Unit 10 to Dispatch, we're westbound I-20 approaching Oak Street, behind a white Acura.”\n\n“Dispatch to Unit 10, I copy. That license plate returns to a stolen vehicle out of Madison.”\n\n“Unit 10, requesting an additional unit.” Another unit went en route.\n\n“Unit 10, exiting at Oak Street into Madison. Notify the police department.” Madison was a small town with a low crime rate. We got about two blocks into the town when two of Madison PD showed up alongside us. I rolled down my window and yelled at one of the PD guys alongside me, “You want it? Go get it.” He seemed pretty excited as he and the other PD unit moved into position and stopped the car.\n\nWe all got out of our cars, and the PD guys yelled verbal commands to get the driver out. He exited without any problems. They yelled commands for the passenger to exit, with her hands up. Pro-tip: if law enforcement tells you to put your hands up, it also implies with nothing in them. The passenger exited with her hands up with a black object still in her hand. I was standing next to the PD guy who was giving commands, so I whispered to him, “Cell phone, right hand.” He yelled to the passenger, “Put your cell phone down!” She did, and was taken into custody without any problems.\n\nAnderson spoke to a Sergeant who showed up. “We can take as much or as little of this as you want.” I'm guessing Madison didn't have anything else going on, because they took all the paperwork on it.\n\nRight when we cleared that, we had reports of a pursuit coming in to our area. The vehicle was doing 120mph across all lanes. Anderson looked at me, with a glint in his eyes, “You wanna go?!” I looked at him with some annoyance, as my easy overtime gig was turning out to be anything but that. And I sighed, “Yeah, sure.” Anderson heard my tone, “I mean, if you don't want to do, we don't have to. But we can probably make it...” And off we went.\n\nRemember those neighboring Troopers dealing with that crashed car? They were in the pursuit path. And when your choice is wait for a tow truck, or get into a pursuit, it doesn't take a genius to figure out which one a Trooper will do.\n\nWe got into position at Madison exit, a few exits ahead of the neighboring unit, right as the other outside units switched over to our radio frequency. “Speed at 100, across all lanes. Vehicle is blacked out now.” That's means they turned their headlights off. About 5 miles behind us.\n\n“Speeds at 110, using the center divide to pass traffic.” 1 mile behind us. We started building up speed.\n\n“We've lost visual around Madison.” Oh yeah, that's where we were. So we just looked for a car driving with no headlights at 120mph. And a good five seconds later, we found it.\n\n“Unit 10, taking primary.” Those neighboring Troopers got into position right behind us. We did a couple miles through some turns around 100+mph as our tire sensor warning light went on. Remember that road construction? We were rapidly approaching it. I watched and cringed, fearing what was potentially going to be some serious carnage. The suspect vehicle went into the only open lane at 90mph, while my car and the other Troopers behind us backed off. Another unit was waiting on the far side of the closure. We got stuck in traffic, and let the other units ahead pick it up.\n\nThere are a few reasons we'll stop pursuing. That tire pressure warning with sustained speeds of 100mph was one of them. We let the other guys carry on as we had five more cars lined up ahead.\n\nWe went straight back to the office after that. I never worked another overtime detail with Anderson.",

        "text": "I only recently discovered this sub, and before I got my life together and went to school, I used to be something of a hooligan. I'll start with a relatively vanilla story, from the years between my outright idiocy and eventual acceptance of adulthood.\n\nDuring those sort of in-between years, I had what one could call a need for speed. That hasn't necessarily changed, I just keep it to the track these days.\n\nFor the sake of anonymity, I'll state that it was an early 2000's German sedan, with a twin turbo six cylinder engine and a terrible record for reliability. Google should fill you in.\n\nI spent almost every dime that year fixing that car, and eventually, after pulling the engine for the 10th time, I said screw it, and just went all out. Bottom end, top end, the whole 9 yards. Rods, stroker crank, Supertech oversized valvetrain, and two entirely-too-large turbos. Skimped entirely on the exhaust, and ran open dumps. \n\nAbout two weeks after the build was finished and broken in, I had spent the whole day with a cable and laptop, on the phone with a tuner, dialing everything in. Never dynoed it, but by the MAF numbers etc., probably sat somewhere around 650hp at the crank.\n\nI finished with all of this at about 3am, and, being a Sunday evening before finals on an unidentified Midwest college campus, there was literally nobody on the roads. So, I decided, fuck it, I'll go for a drive. Babied it around town, watching my AFR and trims, all is well after about 30 minutes, nothing glaring back at me which would indicate I would be in a kaboom situation by cranking up the boost and going WOT.\n\nSo, I did just that. Found an empty stretch of a 4-lane one way road; at this hour, all of the red lights had turned into flashing yellows. Made a couple of passes, didn't see another soul, so on the third pass, I opened the damn thing all the way up. 1st gear, 2nd, 3rd, 4th. Right before the redline, well, after the cluster redline, but before MY 8500rpm redline, I see a set of taillights in the right lane, instantly think oh fuck, but they don't look like CVPI taillights, so I just let off and coasted past. Mind you, I'm at ~7000 rpm in a twin-turbo car with open dumps, so the thing's backfiring and popping like crazy. Just as I pass, I see the car slam on its brakes, and notice police livery on it. Fucking low profile light bars, man.\n\nMind you, top of 4th in this particular car with this particular gearbox, sits somewhere around 135. If I had slammed my brakes, they would have locked up. So I braked as efficiently as I could, down shift, down shift, still no lights. At the point that I came to a full stop, he was still a hundred or two hundred yards behind me, and I pulled over, turned on the hazards, and shut the vehicle off. (sorry, turbos)\n\nA brand-spanking-new Tauraceptor pulls up behind me, still not having lit me up. Spotlights on, cop walks up to my driver's side (I pulled over on the left side of the street). Flashlight instantly in my eyes, and I hear him chuckling.\n\n\"License and proof of insurance?\"\n\nStill chuckling.\n\nI hand them over, he sees that I'm valid, and I'm sure he could see my espresso-fueled super sobriety in my deadened eyes after spending a day tuning a piece of shit beater Nazi sled. \n\n\"So, do you know how fast you were going?\"\n\n\"No, sir. My speedometer doesn't work right now. I just got done building this thing.\" (That was the truth, I messed something up in the cluster and was temporarily using an aftermarket tach) \n\n\"Well, if you had to guess.\"\n\n\"Honestly?\"\n\n\"Honestly.\"\n\n\"Well, I was at the top of fourth, so, I guess, like, a buck thirty?\"\n\nCop cracks up.\n\n\"Yeah, something like that.\" He's still cracking up. Backup arrives, Lady cop walks up to the passengers side. Dude cop stops laughing.\n\n\"So, the speed limit is 45, why on God's green earth were you going that fast?\"\n\n\"Honestly?\"\n\n\"Honestly.\"\n\n\"Well, um, I spent the last three weeks building the motor.\"\n\n\"Yeah? And?\"\n\n\"Well, I guess, officer, my car is now very, very fast. And I just figured that I'd drive it fast.\"\n\n\"That's it? That's your excuse?\" Sternly. Oh shit. Lady cop is illuminating all the detritus and the half-ripped off dashboard.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess.\"\n\nNow, they're both cracking up. I started to laugh too, from nerves, I guess.\n\n\"Hold on,\" still stifling laughter, \"I'll be right back.\" \n\nThey get halfway back to the car, and I start looking at my laptop, to see the third gear logs. Fuck it, right?\n\nHe appears out of nowhere, I jump like I had seen a ghost.\n\n\"You don't have any warrants, right!?!\"\n\n\"No sir, paid everything a few months back.\" (traffic tickets)\n\n\"Ok, I'll be right back.\"\n\n15 or 20 minutes elapse. In lieu of more nerves, I had eventually resigned myself to the fact that I was going to lose the car, and probably spend a night in jail. \n\nSecond unit pulls off. Now I'm confused.\n\nDude cop walks up. No ticket book. Very, very confused. Hands me my license and insurance back.\n\n\"So, here's the deal. I could take you to jail, and have your car towed.\"\n\n\"I know, man. I'm sorry. It was stupid. There's no one out here.\" blah blah blah, I'm just hemorrhaging excuses at this point. I've already collected my valuables. I was ready to go to jail.\n\n\"Well, here, listen. You go to [local giant university], right?\"\n\n\"Right. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Ok, well, you seem like a good kid, and your driving record is already shit, and your insurance must be through the roof, right?\"\n\n\"Right. Yup. Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Right, well, since everyone lies to me all damn day, and you didn't, even though you should have, you know, told me that your girlfriend was in labor, or that you were gonna shit yourself or something, I'm gonna pretend like I didn't see this, and I'm gonna let you go home.\"\n\n\"Oh, shit, thank you, Officer\" blah blah blah genuine ass kissing thank you hemorrhage here.\n\n\"Now, understand, that if I ever pull you over again, going anywhere near this speed, I'm gonna book you on reckless op, and you're gonna go to jail, and you'll probably never see your car again.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, yes, of course, thank you, I'm sorry\" blah blah blah\n\nAn awkward moment, I'm expecting him to walk away, as the interaction seems like it's over, and he sort of walks around the front of the car, with his flashlight, I guess, looking at the lack of a front bumper (didn't fit over intercoolers at that time).\n\nHe starts back towards my window.\n\n\"So, what does this thing have in it?\"\n\n\"Wait, what?\"\n\n\"Like, what motor. Is that the 1.8\"\n\nNow, I'm in the fucking twilight zone.\n\n\"No, sir. It's the 2.7.\"\n\nHe looks back to the intercoolers, back to me.\n\n\"Twin-turbo? V6?\"\n\n\"Yes, exactly. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Well, you saw what I pulled you over in, right?\"\n\n\"Oh, shit, yeah, Tauraceptor, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Brand new.\"\n\n\"I know, I couldn't see the light bar.\"\n\nHe chuckles to himself, \"I noticed.\"\n\nI, jokingly, ask him to pop the hood. \n\n\"Sure, yeah, here.\"\n\nWe spent the next 10 minutes discussing the advents and drawbacks of twin turbo, v6, all wheel drive, heavy piece of shit vehicles, with our hoods popped. And then went on our separate ways.\n\nStill probably one of the strangest experiences I've ever had with law enforcement. I'm still baffled to this day.\n\nP.S. Same guy pulled me over 2 weeks later, for 45 in a 25 (one of those 35&gt;25 trap zones in the middle of town). Impounded my car, but let me walk home. \n\nEnded up becoming sorta friends with him while working as a bouncer downtown. We never really talked about that first encounter. \n",

About ~~20~~ 35 years ago, we used a scenario that a tornado had wiped out the police department's radio tower/antenna and we would provide radio coms for the police.  To do this we used our local repeater (an automatic radio with a high tower/antenna that receives on one frequency and retransmits the audio on another frequency) and our personal mobile radios in a ridealong with the officers. The dispatchers used a stationary radio we had set up in their office.\n\nFCC rules say non-licensed persons can operate in the ham bands only if the radio is under the direct control of a licensed ham, so the hams had to ride along, with the ham gear in the front seat and the officer using it's microphone, but the ham controlling the channel setting.\n\nThe exercise went well, the officer I was riding with was amazed at how great the coverage was, no dead spots, and the sound was so much clearer. We were supposed to run the test for a full eight hours, but it was terminated after four. \n\nI found out later our system was working so much better than the regular one that the chief was taking heat from the other officers that noticed the same thing and he was making the city manager a little nervous.  The regular radio company was caught with their pants down. Crappy maintenance mostly.\n\nBut the city manager decided the city needed to replace the system with a bright-shiny new one instead of requiring the regular company to get their act together. So that was budgeted in.  It still has dead spots and sounds crappy. Same radio company, so same crappy maintenance.\n\nI feel so sorry for the cops.\n\n\nEdit- changed era from 20 years ago to 35.

        "text": "This happened when I was in high school and a new, but legal, driver. It was late on a Friday night.\n\nI was the last, by a fair margin, to leave cleanup from Friday evening band practice. (The teacher was staying even later to work on the routines, but we pretty much had the run of the place anyways, so she was probably just holed up in her office.) I leave the building and start walking to my car, which was the last one in the lot.\n\nAs I enter the parking lot, everything suddenly lights up. I look around for the source of the light and realize, to my great consternation, that it was coming from a exceptionally bright spotlight on a helicopter overhead. I pause for a moment, looking up, but there's no voice from the heavens telling me to do anything, so I figure I might as well move on and they'll turn their light elsewhere.\n\nBut they didn't. Instead, the helicopter spotlight follows me to my car. I get in the car and start to drive home. As soon as I turn onto the main road, I see a police car behind me. No sirens, no loudspeaker, so I just try to drive as legally as possible and keep going.\n\nI've a ways to go on the street and it's a relatively busy street (although less so at that time of night), so I pull into the middle lane. The officer follows very closely behind me. (I was actually very uncomfortable with his following distance. For any other driver, I'd pull to the right lane and let them pass me because it didn't feel like a safe distance.)\n\nThen, four more officers pull on the street for a total of five officers. No lights, no sirens, just following. One officer pulls directly in front of me, then two officers pull up on the side of me. The fifth car stayed behind to the right.\n\nI was literally boxed in on every side by officers carefully keeping pace with me. The helicopter spotlight light up my car and the cars around me, but it was directly from above and slightly behind, so I couldn't see any of the officers driving, just their cars. \n\nAfter about 10–15 minutes of driving, my heart beating out of my chest and my mind racing, trying to figure out what I might have done to warrant this, we came to a red light. The officer in front of me stopped and I stopped behind him, taking careful note to leave a legal amount of space between us when we stopped. Both “side” cars stayed directly behind me, despite a full car's length between them and the red light.\n\nThe light turned green and we all started through the light. The car on my right turned right at the light (no blinker) and the car on my left turned left (no blinker, did not use the turn lane). The one in front of me pulled into a u-turn spot directly ahead of the light and turned around. The helicopter turned off his light. The two officers behind me followed me for one more light, then both used their blinkers and turned right at the next light.\n\nNo sirens, no loudspeakers, no idea what it was all about.",

I tell dispatch I am clear from that particular event, and they immediately dispatch me to a disturbance at another motel nearby. (Two room mates in a verbal argument, nothing to go running code about).\n\nI don't immediately head that way because I am finishing up a few last details I'll need for my report later. As I'm doing so, dispatch sends another officer on a call to the same motel I am currently at. The caller advised that 2 subjects who had just shot someone in a neighboring town were supposedly enroute to the motel whose parking lot I was currently occupying. \n\nI throw my car in drive and book it out of the parking lot into a nice hiding spot next door. I wanted to be able to have a good and tactical vantage point, and also didn't want to blow any chance of catching them. If they saw me sitting in the parking lot, they probably wouldn't pull in and get a room like they hadn't just possibly killed someone.\n\nI tell dispatch to reassign my verbal dispute call because I was already on scene at the motel where the alleged shooters were heading. \n\nOfficers sometimes describe their job, or shift, as a roller-coaster.  Switching gears, quickly, up down up down up down. This night could not be a better example of this type of metaphor. And it was just the beginning.\n\nI went from \"ah, ok, those may be stolen license plate decals I guess I'll investigate that,\" to \"oh, by the way, people who just possibly shot someone are headed to where you are right now\". CRAP! Gear switch! Little less detective now, lot more tactical.\n\nI wait,  and wait. The vehicle never shows up. I confirm with the clerk that no one with the names I had been given as offenders were currently registered to any rooms. I'm getting ready to wrap it up and clear off with no contact, when Dispatch pulls me from the call anyway. \n\n\"Be enroute to Blah blah motel for two room mates still in a verbal altercation\".\n\nI'm thinking, \"Seriously? Again? Didn't the other officers that were sent the 1st time not squash that problem before they left?\" Apparently not. So I head to the other motel.\n\nI meet with the caller, one of the room mates, who is all kinds of angry and spilling his side of the story talking 90 miles per hour. \"All I wanna do is go to sleep and he won't leave me alone!! He stuck his finger in my face and went like *that* \" (He demonstrates by poking himself in the forehead with his finger.)\n\nI knew enough from the call notes, and the look on my partners face who had responded to the first call, to know that this guy wasn't just innocently laying in his bed trying to go to sleep, while his ass hole room mate was harassing him. It was very much a mutual argument. It was insanely immature. It was also a waste of time for police to be responding a second time to what can be best described as a \"adolescent sibling spat\". He might as well have been saying, \"MMMOOOOMMMMM! He's being mean to me again!\" \"But Mooommmm!! He started it!!\" \n\nIt was literally nothing but two grown men who couldn't just shut up and go to bed. \n\nYears of training and experience, to protect and serve, and yet here I am. This is what your taxes are paying me to do at the moment. \n\nHe finished his spiel about being \"victimized\" and \"harassed\". Myself and the other officer just stare at him. I was still kind of distracted by the buzz from my previous call believing armed and dangerous subjects were going to pull in any minute, and now all the sudden I'm listening to the whines of a grown man about how he got poked in the forehead. My patience was thin.\n\n(I reserve the following line ONLY for when it is truly deserved.)\n\n\"Okkkkayyy... so, what do you want me to do about it?\"\n\nGuy: \"Tell him to leave me alone!\" \n\nMe: \"Yea, we already did that. Apparently ya'll still can't get along, sooooo.... all I know to tell ya is pay for a separate room\"\n\nGuy: \"I don't have the money!\"\n\nMe: \"Seriously. What is it that you want me to do? Arrest him for arguing with you? Cause I can't do that\"\n\nGuy: No! I dont want that! I dont want anyone to go to jail!\n\nMe: ......then why did you call the *police*? \n\nGuy: I just want to go to sleep!! \n\nMe: *blank stare*\n\nSo then I go talk to his room mate, who by the way, was nothing but calm and believable with his explanation of events that occurred. He even said he'd pack his stuff and go sleep in the truck just so the other guy would leave *him* alone and he could get some sleep. \n\n*Thumbs up* Sounds good to me. Now *that's* a problem that could of been solved without uniformed police officers carrying guns. \n\nI take the elevator back down stairs heading to my car to get out of there. The elevator dings letting me know I'm on ground level. I'm shaking my head and grumbling to myself over the complete pettiness of grown men.\n\nAs the elevator door opens, before I even step out, the first thing I see is my partner standing on the other side. He points to his right and says, \"Hey look!... A domestic!\" As the door finishes opening I see a female, covered in blood, sobbing standing a few feet away.\n\nWhat the fresh hell is going on, I'm thinking to myself.\n\n*GEAR SWITCH*\n\nI now jump from dealing with two grown men acting like children, to what I believe is a woman who just got the mess beat out of her by her husband who is still nearby.\n\nI ask my partner where the guy is... he points to the back door. I grab the woman and move her away from there to a safer location and begin interviewing her. She has a knot the size of a golf ball on her forehead and is bleeding. She's also VERY pregnant. I call for medics.\n\nWith her tucked away and safe, I walk outside, identify the possible offender and detain him for further questioning. I also have a witness to the assault nearby who is being less than forth coming and cooperative. \n\nI return to the woman and begin questioning her. It doesn't take long before I start suspecting that it isn't as cut and dry as it originally looked. Her story wasn't adding up, and though she seemed very willing to cooperate, her details were lacking to non-existant. My head was swimming from all the gear shifting, so I continued to give her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nI'm trying to process what she's telling me when my partner walks up and says, \"Hey.... I need some trespass warnings. Management wants those two room mates who keep arguing trespassed from the property they're kicking them out\". I look back at him, I'm sure, with frustration written all over my face. \n\n*Oh my God, deep breathe, don't get frustrated. She needs your full attention right now*\n\nI request another officer respond to assist me while my partner takes care of the trespasses. I can't work two calls at once.\n\n*I need fresh air and to get away from people so I can interview her*\n\nI tell her to come outside with me, and she gladly does so. As we walk out the front door, I see the \"But Moooommmm\" room mate standing out front talking (yelling) into the phone. I ignore him and make a quick right turn away from him. He sees me walking by, looks at me, and yells \"these *ucking *ss hole cops...!!!!\" Into the phone.\n\nI keep walking. I really don't have time for his attempt to provoke me at the moment. \n\nI walk the female away and down the sidewalk and let her sit down to relax. As I begin trying to clarify her version of the story, I am distracted again by the room mate screaming as loud as it seems he can \"*uckin' [inappropriate expletive]\" \"[cuss word] [more cuss words]... pigs...[cuss] cops!!!!!\"\n\n*GEAR SWITCH* from being a compassionate officer for this potential abuse victim... to being authoritative and firm dealing with a disorderly subject causing a disruption to my investigation, the paying motel customers standing nearby, and the general public peace.\n\n\"I'm so sorry ma'am. Just a moment.\"\n\n\"HEY!! YOU CAN QUIT YELLING,  OR I CAN TAKE YOU TO JAIL!\"\n\nHe ignores me, but I know he hears me, he quiets down.\n\nMy partner walks up, shoves trespass warnings at me, \"Can you sign these real quick?\"\n\n\"SURE!\"\n\n  I scribble my signature, hand them back, and return my attention to the female.\n\n\"Okay, so ya'll were in the room in a verbal argument, lets start back there....\"\n\n*A minute later* I hear:\n\n'Cops are this and that... A-Holes... male genitalia... effin cops!!!!!' \n\nI give another warning. He again ignores me. I shine my flash light in his direction to get his attention and make him look at me. He turns his back to me, in response to the light, and gets quiet again. \n\nBut not for long.\n\n \"Effin cops!....%^*@#$\"\n\nAll he had to do... *ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS BE QUIET. SHUT UP AND GO TO BED* \n\n*GEAR SWITCH*\n\nAnd now he was going to jail. \n\nWith my other units arriving just in time to assist me with all this craziness, I walk over, grab his hand, and simultaneously place him in handcuffs. He acts confused, and starts throwing out excuses... \"What? Huh? I was just talking on the phone??!\" \"I wasn't doing anything!!\" \"Im just calling someone to come pick me up!!\"\n\nThen for the rest of the night I got to hear about how much of a piece of shi* cop I was for arresting someone who *has a child with autism*.\n\nYeah. Using your son's medical condition as an excuse for your belligerent and disorderly behavior... and I'm the piece of crap? \n\nTo bring this long story to a close: The \"effing cops\" took the cussing room mate to jail for disorderly conduct.\n\nAnd my \"abuse victim\" was arrested for domestic violence after it was determined (and she admitted) to attacking her husband and beating herself up. Which was supported by the witness's testimony who finally agreed to cooperate.\n\nThey were placed in neighboring cells and bonded quite nicely over conversation while me and other officers worked on our pile of paperwork.\n\nWhat a night.\n\n",

        "text": "(X-Post over from /r/AskReddit thread asking \"What case did you not care to find the answer? Why?\"\n\nRolling along during early evening of a mid-shift patrol, got a radio call from dispatch:\n\n\"Patrol-1, Dispatch, respond to 1234 XYZ street, contact complainant.\"\n\nRecognizing the address, I replied back, \"Dispatch, Patrol-1, mark us enroute...  Loud noise complaint yet again from that address?\"\n\n\"Patrol-1, Dispatch, that's a negative... subject has a damage complaint\"\n\nIntriguing.  The Joe Dirt level subject at that address had been a frequent flier member of our seemingly nightly list of loud noise complaints for the area, always having beer fueled parties with his buddies, often dragging his [large speakers](http://www.randallrash.com/web_images/OBtower_room_medium.jpg) out onto his back patio to entertain themselves (and the surrounding 3 blocks) with their taste in tunes.\n\nPulling up out front, we report on scene and exit the patrol car and start to approach the house, sort of surprised at it being so quiet for this time of night.  Subject opens the front door and steps out to greet us dressed in the standard attire for Joe Dirt calls...  jeans, no shirt, no shoes.  (It's almost like a uniform.)  He immediately starts to yell at us...\n\n\"Always coming around to bother us when we're just having a little fun, but where were you when I needed you to do your job?!?!?\"\n\n\"You are right Joe, this is a change to have you calling us instead of the normal routine...  What's going on?\"\n\n\"Here, I'll show you\", He then walks around the side of the house (much to my relief, as I was fairly sure we'd find piles of paperwork inspiring problems if we'd gone through the house) to the side gate and into the back yard.\n\nBemused, we follow along, coming to a stop as Joe says \"I just got home to find this\", points with both hands and just starts cursing...\n\nHis two tower speakers were there, but the wires had been cut... Several times.  Each of the speakers themselves bore several stabbing holes.  From the size of the holes, I'm guessing someone used one of those large [Rambo Knives](http://www.bestramboknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Rambo-2-Knife-Sylvester-Stallone-Action-Movie.jpg) to vent their frustrations over lost sleep.  To top it all off, as I stepped closer to get a better look at the damage, the smell of gasoline hit me.  They had doused both towers with gas and even poured some inside each one.\n\n\"Well Joe, this all looks like the work of someone with some emotional investment in what they were doing... if these had been people we'd be looking for the girlfriend or wife.  Obviously this was someone who knew you...  Do you have anyone you've made angry that you know of?\"\n\nMy partner devolved into an unexpected coughing fit, hiding his mouth behind his fist.  Pretty sure he owed me a coke for having made him laugh.\n\nJoe was doing his best impersonation of a groundhog with the comment flying high over his head.  \"No way man...  this had to be one of those assholes that always calls you whenever I have a few friends over.  You should pull that list to find out who did this!\"\n\n\"Hmmmm.  Great idea Joe.  We'll do that.  Here, let us get a few photos; we already have your info on file so we should be able to put the report together pretty easy.\"\n\nMinutes later, seatbelting back into the car as we calling in clear to Dispatch, I look over at my partner, \"Dinner?\",  he nodded, \"Dinner.\"\n",

        "text": "My aunt is a police officer. She got promoted to a desk job years ago but stays in shape and at least once a month she goes out into the streets for a shift to stay in touch with the regular police work. So occasionally I see her while she's ticketing someone or just walking down the street in uniform or something like that. It's probably good to know this is in a medium sized Dutch city.\n\nToday I was walking down *the* shopping street of the city when I heard a commotion. Not a commotion of fear or anger, but of surprise. And then I saw a chicken running towards me. I can tell you that a chicken is rather out of place here, so people were surprised. The chicken dodged between a few people and got up on the edge of a rubbish bin. \n\nA few seconds later I saw my aunt run up in uniform, with another police officer following her. The other officer ran around the chicken and they approached it from 2 sides. The chicken flew up and escaped. This happened about 5 times. Finally they got it and they walked off with the chicken in a box. By that time I had taken a few pictures of them trying to catch the chicken. I sent an unflattering one to my aunt with the caption \"Chicken wings for dinner tonight?\". I think I'm probably her least favourite nephew today :)\n\nI'm not sure where the chicken came from but at least I've seen my aunt in action doing very important police work again :)",

        "text": "Was reading this sub and it brought to mind the times I got robbed working the third shift (and second) working at a convenience store and the one time I actually kicked a cop out of the store for not wanting to do his job, which I will get to last.\n\nFirst robbery I actually felt bad for the guy who did it, he was in his 60's most likely.\n\nThe counter of the store had a cutaway portion right near the register and this man came in the middle of the night, walked right up to this part of the counter and asked me some question (which I thought was about a lighter as I was at the far end of the same counter).\n\nWhen I got close enough to him (blocking his way to get any further behind the counter and at 6'5 and not exactly being small I never got any issues usually unless people were drunk to that stupid point -I have so many damn stories of people going off after we stopped selling booze that I could probably write a book on it and the other crazy stuff that happened there as I worked right across the street from a hospital that got all the trauma patients from a very infamous area of a major US city-), the guy spins me around and in my peripheral vision I see him stick his finger in my back and he says: \"This is a robbery.\"\n\nI am not going to fight the guy, I just say stay calm and hey it is all yours (I think I freaked out the cop that looked at the tape as he said you are the calmest robbery victim we have ever seen lol).\n\nHe took instant Lotto tickets, a carton of smokes and cash..went to a motel two blocks down and was busted in ten minutes from when the squad cars first arrived at the store.\n\nEdit to add: This also showed me how stupid the public can be as well as one regular walked right past the squads blocking the entrences to the lot, right past the fingerprint dust on the door and on the counter and starts to make a cup of coffee..hello? Did nothing to you scream 'crime scene?'\n\nPeople are oblvious I swear to God. \n\nSecond time I should have known better, believe it or not I kind of gained this sixth sense about people working at this place.\n\nAnyway, guy comes in before second shift goes into third, has a damn bandanna around his neck but won't make eye contact with me at all. \n\nHowever I am almost home, a new coworker was stocking the cooler and I had to help with all the paperwork stuff so I was stupid enough not to notice.\n\nSure enough the guy comes back with the bandanna over his face and has a black plastic shopping bag with some object in it that he points in my direction.\n\nSame thing, tell him to stay cool and stay calm and he put the bag down to take the money out of the drawer, and the object inside sounded too heavy to be a gun, but again I got paid like crap to deal with a lot of BS so I am not doing anything dumb.\n\nGuy tells me to get down on the ground and I do and this guy was never caught.\n\nThe third instance was the one I really felt like sharing because in my time working there I got to know a lot of local PD and honestly them Bs'ing in there was fine by me as it was a deterrent to things like I am talking about (and many more strange things I saw there, some of which, like the time traveling lady or the woman who claimed I fathered her child probably make interesting stories on their own lol).\n\nI also got out of small petty things by knowing so many of them as well, and have a great story about that too when my friend kept saying I did not know the local PD like that..till he got pulled over with me once.\n\nAnyway, one night one of the security guards, walked acroos to the store and started grabbing items. \n\nWhicle he is in the aisle furthest from the door I see this old beat up car pull into the lot with two guys inside it. They back into the spot so the front of the car is facing the street.\n\nOne guy walks in with sunglasses, a hat and a leather trench coat on. I greet  him and he starts to reach into the trench. \n\nThen this guy notices the security guard and he picks up a TV Guide (the old small kind that used to be at the counters in stores way back when) and starts flipping through it. His hands are literally shaking as he does this.\n\nThew security guard starts to get rung up and he says to me while moving his eyes from mine to Trenchcoat a couple times: \"You know there are some real weirdos out tonight.\"\n\nI say: \"Yes, I know.\"\n\nSo the security guy goes outside and stands right by the door and gets on his radio and calls the hospital security truck over to the store lot. \n\nTrenchcoat put down the TV Guide, hand still shaking and goes: \"Give me a pack of smokes.\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"Any kind, I don't care.\"\n\nNow listen here..I have been drunk beyond belief, used to smoke pot like it was oxygen but always knew what brand of cigarettes I wanted.\n\nSo he buys them and leaves and him and his ahem, 'driver' pull out of the lot.\n\nSo I call the police and when this guy gets there he was the one guy I could not really stand. He always seemed arrogant and just his vibe was off.\n\nI told him exactly what I just told you guys and he said it was all in my mind. \n\nI essentially told him to get the fuck out, the direction they were heading had two more 24 hour stores right down the street (both of which I called as I would if I had an incident and saw the idiot possibly heading their way) and if he was too damn lazy to do his damn job then please do not come into the store, at least not while I am working.\n\nAmazingly he said nothing just got a bright red face and left. \n\nAs I said, I liked most of the cops I met doing that, but that guy was just a lazy douchebag and possibly put someones life in danger at some point by not believing me or being lazy because I am pretty sure Trenchcoat did not have flowers for me under his jacket...",

Up ahead of me there is a line of cars turning left across my side of the highway. \nThere is an office building surrounded by cornfields and some of their workers come in early to  beat traffic like I do.  I have the right of way but of course the last cars have to stay with the pack forcing me to slow down.  I judge when the last car will clear my lane and as it passes I put my foot back down on the gas.  Suddenly I see a yellow safety vest.  There is a police officer right in the middle of my lane only ten yards away.  I did not even have time to realize what was happening.  Some reflex took over and I turned the wheel hard right.  I passed the guy, (mid 20's, clean shaven), half in my lane and half on the shoulder at around 45 miles per hour.   I must have been in adrenaline shock, because I was a mile down the road before I realized what had happened.\n   The police come during rush hour to direct traffic so the office workers can make the turn to their building without jamming up the highway.   The officer I nearly hit came early, and instead of standing in front of the cars towards oncoming  traffic, he went behind the cars away from  traffic.  The line of cars turning left hid him from view.  So I couldn't see him until the last car went.   \nIt was a simple mistake and no one was hurt. Eventually my heart-rate slowed down to normal.  \nI'm not really sure why I decided to share this.  I guess I just wish I could say to that young cop, \"Keep your head in the game and stay alert. Even if your doing something as boring as directing traffic.  And by the way you scared the fuck out of me!\"\n",

        "text": "*A bit of background: I am not a sworn police officer.  I work in a non-sworn capacity for a police department, assigned to regular patrol.  Aside from my lack of peace officer status, I function and carry all the same equipment/duties as my sworn counterparts.*\n\nI was a dumb kid in high school.  I'm sure you can relate-- we've all made some poor choices in our youth.\n\nThis story is less about me and more about Derek, another dumb kid that went to my high school, and how two similar paths can go very differently.\n\nDerek was never a bad kid.  In fact, he was always kind of soft, you could just tell by looking.  But that never stopped him from shooting off his mouth, fluffing his feathers to make himself appear bigger to those around him.  Everyone knows someone like this.  The insecurity always finds its way to the surface.\n\nTo this day, I don't know if what happened to Derek was my fault.  I wonder if I was the catalyst for where he'd eventually end up in life.\n\nEveryone picked on Derek during our Freshman and Sophomore years.  Hell, they picked on me too, but not as much because I didn't shoot my mouth off like he would.  Since I was a dumb kid, sometimes I'd join in teasing Derek, if only to buy myself a brief respite from my own tormentors.  Looking back, Derek was one of those kids that tried way too hard to be cool, or simply accepted.\n\nOne day, Derek had enough.  He came up to me at the bus stop after school, a small crowd of kids in tow.  I still remember that his lunch-stained secondhand shirt and too-tight pants, the look of cocky arrogance on his face.  He had black baseball \"cutter\" gloves tightly strapped on, his tiny fists clenched as he approached me, and once he was close enough, gave me a solid left jab that knocked me down, leaving me to ride home that day with a deep gash below my right eye.\n\nI learned my lesson that day.  I would never run my mouth or pick a fight again if I could help it.  It's saved me a lot of trouble.\n\nFor the last two years of high school, I witnessed Derek's steady transformation, although I never spoke to him again.  He began sagging his pants.  He stopped showing up for classes.  I saw him hanging with the delinquent crowd, a gold grill in his mouth, smoking weed and scrawling unintelligible curses on clean surfaces.  Despite his newfound acceptance among those that once bullied him, I sensed that he never quite fit in with them either.  Like I said, you could tell he was still soft.\n\nThe last time Derek ever spoke to me, he was almost apologetic.  I nearly tripped over his Air Jordans as he sat outside the principal's office with the other kids that wouldn't make it to graduation, and he greeted me with a sheepish \"Hey man.\"  I pretended not to hear him.\n\nNearly a decade later, I was out on patrol one day when I heard a radio call go out on the other side of town.  A man had become angry at a stranger over a petty disagreement and decided to punch him so hard he fractured his own knuckles.\n\nMy coworkers responded and I heard the name come over the air, then the birth date.  As the criminal history blared out of my radio... \"danger potential\"... \"known to carry weapons...\" \"history of resisting with violence\"... I couldn't shake the name and DOB.  Why did it seem so familiar?\n\nIt wasn't until I returned to the station and saw Derek's mugshot that I realized it was him, now facing a new felony charge.\n\nI found the arresting officer, a grizzled veteran with a deep soothing baritone, and asked him about his experience with Derek.\n\n\"Well,\" he said as he folded his hands across his belt, \"it was odd.  He didn't seem like a bad kid.  In fact... he seemed really soft and docile.\"\n\nHe went on as the memories began to flood back to me.  \"Every time we got on the radio, he'd excitedly ask what so-and-so radio code meant.  He heard me say '10-4' and said to me 'I know 10-4! I used to work security uptown!'\"\n\nThat was a lie.  Derek never worked uptown, because I now realized that during my time [working security at a strip club at that very location](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/4xlr5t/citizen_my_phone/), he was one of the thugs I regularly barred entry to and warily monitored as he prowled up and down the block with other degenerates, shamelessly accosting every short skirt in sight with explicit offers.\n\n\"Did you know him or something?\"\n\n\"Well... yeah... he kicked my ass once in high school.\"\n\nThe veteran officer nodded wisely.  \"I see.  Well, he did mention that the first time he got arrested was for fighting in high school.  I dunno.  He doesn't seem like a bad kid.\"\n\nI went home that night thinking about all the possible outcomes had I been just a tad kinder, a bit more resilient and mature.  Would it have saved Derek if I had just befriended him all those years ago?  Would Derek be patrolling alongside me, on the other side of the law?\n\nThe thoughts are still with me to this day.",

        "text": "This happened about a year ago, give or take.\n\nI live in Wyoming, which is a constitutional carry state. Meaning, I don't need a permit to carry a concealed firearm so long as I'm A) over 21, B) don't have a criminal record, and C) have taken a state-certified firearms safety course which includes things like hunter's ed, CCL training, etc. Considering I met all three criteria, and basically got free training since I was a CJ major at my college, I felt fairly comfortable carrying, and had been since I'd turned 21 a year or so previously.\n\nMy parents invited me and a friend (who also carried regularly) to come out to their place a few states over to stay for a few days on vacation. Great! We loaded up the car, bought all the obligatory road trip junk food, and headed out. I made sure once we crossed the WY state line to unholster, unload, and store my gun in a locked case in the back. \n\nWe left at the end of that weekend. It was a long drive, and I'm notorious for being able to sleep in pretty much any condition. I woke up sometime that afternoon when we pulled into a rest stop. I was almost positive we were in Wyoming. Hell, we'd been driving for close to seven hours right? We must have crossed the border by now. So, I holstered back up and thought nothing of it.\n\nThat was, until my buddy decided to go just a *little* too fast, right in front of a highway patrolman. I was just about to nod off again when that unmistakable \"whoop whoop!\" and flashing lights jerked me out of sleep. \n\nI, of course, was giving my friend unbelievable amounts of shit as the officer walked up. That was, until he introduced himself.\n\n\"Afternoon, I'm Trooper so-and-so with the Montana highway patrol, do you have your license, registration, and proof of insurance?\"\n\nOh shit. We're still in Montana. Cue panic attack here.\n\nApparently the trooper saw my eyes go as wide as dinner plates because the next words out of his mouth after getting our IDs were; \"Anything in the vehicle I should know about?\"\n\nAt this point I figured he knew something was up so I came clean. \"Sir, I'm going to level with you. I'm currently carrying a concealed firearm, and in Wyoming we don't need a permit for that. I fell asleep, I thought we crossed the state line about an hour ago...\"\n\nHis eyes narrow. Hand moves a little closer to his belt. Oh shit. \"How about you step out of the vehicle for me.\" Oh SHIT. \n\nI do what he says, and a minute later I've got my hands on the hood of the car as the trooper secures my .45. At this point I'm terrified. Am I going to go to jail? This is a felony right? Oh god I'm SCREWED.\n\n\"You said you were from Wyoming?\" He asks me, a little calmer now that I'm not packing. \n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And ya'll don't need permits to carry concealed there?\"\n\n\"N-no sir, constitutional carry state.\"\n\n\"Hmm...let me run your info real quick, hang tight.\"\n\nI'm sure he could see my knees shaking the whole time. He checks my ID, the gun, the vehicle, everything. After what feels like an eternity he gets off the radio, and for whatever reason is chuckling. \"You got a case for that weapon, son?\"\n\nI nod and pull it out of the trunk. To my surprise, he puts the gun and magazine inside, shuts it, and sticks the case back in the trunk. \"Well, considering ya'll were honest with me, I'll let you go with a warning. And by the way,\" He laughs a bit and points down the road. \"Wyoming border is about twenty miles that way. Ya'll have a nice day.\" \n\nLesson learned: Check google maps before you put on a gun.",

        "text": "I was helping another Trooper at the scene of a crash on the freeway during rush hour. It was a relatively minor incident, and it was a rare day where we had three Troopers on scene. We moved all the vehicles to the right shoulder of an off-ramp just to finish the paperwork. I was working in an area with a population around 1 million people, so anything we can do to get traffic moving faster, we do.\n\nI was back in my car, about to drive away, when I glanced to my left and saw a red Civic directly next to me, stuck in traffic on the ramp. I looked at the passenger and realized she looked vaguely familiar. Then I looked at the driver and realized he looked vaguely familiar. And they both seemed pretty intent on looking straight ahead. I looked at the car, looked at the passenger again, and looked at the driver again. Then I got really excited as it all clicked.\n\nI got out of my car, walked up to the driver's window and knocked on it. He rolled it down.\n\n\"Didn't I stop you yesterday?\"\n\n\"...yeah.\"\n\n\n**Rewind to yesterday.**\n\nI was heading back to the office at the end of shift, about to hit overtime due to some late calls. Sergeants don't like unscheduled overtime unless there's a good reason. It's a waste of taxpayer money. I was on track to get back to the office with just enough time to avoid that.\n\nI watched as a red Civic a few cars ahead of me, going 20mph faster than everyone else, drove in an exit-only lane to bypass traffic, and cut back onto the freeway, passing 50 cars in the process. I can't stand when drivers do that. So I stopped him.\n\n\"Good afternoon, sir, the reason I stopped you was for failing to exit as required. I need to see your driver's license, registration, and insurance.\"\n\n\"This is a rental car. She has her driver's license.\" He motioned to the passenger. Notice how he didn't address anything I asked for.\n\n\"Okay. But you're driving. I need to see *your* driver's license.\"\n\n\"I don't have one.\"\n\n\"How about an ID?\"\n\n\"I don't have that either.\" End of shift was getting closer. \n\n\"If this is a rental car, and you don't have a driver's license, how did you rent the car?\"\n\n\"It's in her name.\"\n\nI got positive ID on him from a database I accessed in my car. And confirmed his passenger's license was valid, and that it was rented to her. I went back to the driver.\n\n\"So here's what's going to happen. She's going to drive. You're getting a warning because I don't have time for this. If I see you driving again, you're getting a ticket for driving on a suspended driver's license and I'm impounding the car for 30 days. That's an easy $3000 in fees.\" I then addressed the female. \"And you. Make better decisions. You know he doesn't have a driver's license. *You* will be on the hook for that 30 day impound, in addition to the rental fees. Don't let him drive.\"\n\nThey were on their way and I got back on time.\n\n**Less than 24 hours later.**\n\n\"Didn't I stop you yesterday?\"\n\n\"...yeah.\"\n\n\"Driver's license.\"\n\n\"You know I don't have one.\"\n\n\"Pull over, right here.\" He did so. \"Keys.\" He handed them to me. \"I told you yesterday that if I saw you driving this car again I'd be impounding it for a month. I wasn't lying then and I'm not lying now. Get out of the car, I'm taking it.\" I went over the radio to another Trooper on scene, \"Hey Garcia, hang out for a second.\" Garcia stood by as I had further words with the occupants. Garcia came up to me a few moment later, \"What's up? I've never seen you this mad at anyone...or mad ever, really.\" I explained the story to him.\n\nThey got to walk home that day. If you wonder why you didn't get a warning that one time you were stopped, you can thank people like this. ",

I also noticed he had a second cell phone mounted to his windshield, which I thought was a little odd.\nI pulled him over and greeted him. \"Good afternoon, sir. The reason I stopped you is for using your cell phone while driving.\"\n\n\"No I wasn't.\" Great, one of these guys.\n\n\"Left hand, left ear, black phone. I watched you for 5 seconds moving your mouth.\"\n\n\"Oh, you must mean this one.\" He pointed to the one mounted on the windshield. \"I only use this for GPS.\"\n\n\"I'm aware you have that one there. I mean the one sitting in your center console with the screen still on.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't using that one.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" You don't ever want me to say that to you, while ignoring what you just said. \"Driver's license, registration, and insurance.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't using my phone.\"\n\n\"Driver's license. Registration. And insurance.\"\n\nHe provided his information as I walked back and wrote his cell phone ticket. I walked back up, expecting another lovely conversation.\n\n\"Sir, you're receiving a citation for using your cell phone while driving. I need your signature in the box at the bottom.\n It's not an admission of guilt, just a promise that you're going to take care of it.\"\n\n\"I'm not guilty.\"\n\n\"I did not say you were guilty. As I explained, signing is *not* an admission of guilt. It's a promise to take care of it.\"\n\n\"But if I sign, I have to pay.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. Signing is not saying you're guilty.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not signing.\"\n\n\"Sir, this is a promise to appear. Are you aware of what happens if you don't sign? If you don't sign, you go to jail.\"\n\n\"I'm not signing.\"\n\nHe chose the hard way. \"Step out of the car.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Dispatch, start me a second unit, refusal to sign.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay, I'll sign!\"\n\nThat driver did not go to jail that day.",
