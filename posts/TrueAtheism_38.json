I think he is absolutely adorable and he is genuinely one of the nicest people I have ever met. However, I'm hesitant on dating someone that is religious in fear of our vastly different beliefs causing conflict down the road when marriage, family, and children may become a factor.\n\nAlso, I know my parents would never approve of me becoming romantically involved with someone who is Muslim. My mom is heavily involved in a Christain church which has taught on numerous occassions that Islam is an evil religion and its followers can't be trusted. I don't hold these convictions, but I know since my family does it will cause conflict between us. \n\nFor those of who have been in a relationship with someone who is religious, how was it? What obstacles did you face together and what were the positives? ",

They invited us over to dinner, which originally was supposed to be at their house. When we got there, they asked if we wanted to go to this local religious pizza joint that just opened (they know I'm an Atheist, her mother added me on FB shortly after we started dating). I said that's fine, not a huge deal. I'm in the bible belt so I'm used to it by now. \n\n\nThat wasn't the issue. Once we got there, they kept poking at the subject. Just casually bringing up god and how he saved their lives during conversation. About 45 minutes into the meal, they asked me if I was a non-believer. My response was the same as always, \"I don't believe in any gods, but I also don't think it's impossible\". That response was followed by me saying I would prefer not to discuss it with them. \n\n\nThey didn't directly bring it up again, as far as asking me questions is concerned. But the kept poking at it all night, mentioning god in almost every conversation. I know some people are just like that, but my SO said her parents typically don't bring it up that much, it was unusual for them.\n\n\nI know it's their \"duty\" to try to convert me, but it's not going to happen. The only person that will change my mind, is me. I've already said that I would prefer not to discuss it again, but I have a funny feeling it will come up over and over. I don't want to debate with them because it will likely piss them off. I just plain don't want to talk about it.\n\n\nAny advice on how to handle this? I feel that if I say anything more about the way I feel about the matter, it will just cause more problems than it's worth. But I'm also not one to sit back and deal with it.

        "text": "Existence of God\n\nA: The Uncaused Cause: In this argument, I’ll use purely secular arguments to attempt to prove the existence of a singular, personal, and eternal God. The law of science known as the Law of Causality, or Law of Cause and Effect, says that every material effect must have an adequate antecedent or simultaneous cause. \n\nThe universe, being a material object, falls under the domain of this law. A popular response to this statement is the universe is not finite, that it has always existed. Let’s take a closer look at this hypothesis. If the universe was indeed infinite, we would observe it to be static. However, it is a well known observation that the galaxies of the universe are flying farther and farther from each other. In other words, the universe is expanding. This suggests that at one point at time, the universe was contained in a single point, that it had a beginning. Another observation that suggests the universe had a beginning is the first law of thermodynamics which states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed. If energy could neither be created nor destroyed, how would an infinite universe come into being? \n\nThe universe, in a sense, is one giant closed/isolated system, so how could anything exist in this system if it were infinite? The universe must be finite, it had to begin. So, if something began the universe and is not a material object, what caused this object that caused the universe? It is easy to see that this line of questioning can go on forever, it is an infinite regress. So, the question must be what is the non-material uncaused caused that caused the universe? God. \n\nB: Precise Constants: The existence of God is written in nature, through impossibly precise constants to repetitive ratios/patterns, God is evident. \n\nMartin Rees (British cosmologist and astrophysicist. He has been Astronomer Royal since 1995 and was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 2004 to 2012 and President of the Royal Society between 2005 and 2010) formulates the fine-tuning of the Universe in terms of the following six dimensionless physical constants: N, the ratio of the strength of electromagnetism to the strength of gravity for a pair of protons, is approximately 1036. According to Rees, if it were significantly smaller, only a small and short-lived universe could exist. Epsilon (ε), the strength of the force binding nucleons into nuclei, is 0.007. If it were 0.006, only hydrogen could exist, and complex chemistry would be impossible. If it were 0.008, no hydrogen would exist, as all the hydrogen would have been fused shortly after the big bang. Omega (Ω), also known as the Density parameter, is the relative importance of gravity and expansion energy in the universe. It is the ratio of the mass density of the universe to the “critical density” and is approximately 1. If gravity were too strong compared with dark energy and the initial metric expansion, the universe would have collapsed before life could have evolved. On the other side, if gravity were too weak, no stars would have formed. Lambda (λ) is the cosmological constant. It describes the ratio of the density of dark energy to the critical energy density of the universe, given certain reasonable assumptions such as positing that dark energy density is a constant. In terms of Planck units, and as a natural dimensionless value, the cosmological constant, λ, is on the order of 10−122.This is so small that it has no significant effect on cosmic structures that are smaller than a billion light-years across. If the cosmological constant was not extremely small, stars and other astronomical structures would not be able to form. Q, the ratio of the gravitational energy required to pull a large galaxy apart to the energy equivalent of its mass, is around 10−5. If it is too small, no stars can form. If it is too large, no stars can survive because the universe is too violent, according to Rees. D, the number of spatial dimensions in space-time, is 3. Rees claims that life could not exist if there were 2 or 4.\n\nRepetitive Patterns: \nFibonacci Sequence: The Fibonacci numbers are nature's numbering system. It is defined as: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 and on to infinity. Each number is the sum of the previous two. This pattern appears everywhere in nature, from the leaf arrangement in plants, to the pattern of the florets of a flower, the bracts of a pinecone, or the scales of a pineapple. Look at the array of seeds in the center of a sunflower and you'll notice what looks like spiral patterns curving left and right. Amazingly, if you count these spirals, your total will be a Fibonacci number. Divide the spirals into those pointed left and right and you'll get two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. You can decipher spiral patterns in pinecones, pineapples and cauliflower that also reflect the Fibonacci sequence in this manner. Some plants express the Fibonacci sequence in their growth points, the places where tree branches form or split. One trunk grows until it produces a branch, resulting in two growth points. The main trunk then produces another branch, resulting in three growth points. Then the trunk and the first branch produce two more growth points, bringing the total to five. This pattern continues, following the Fibonacci numbers. Additionally, if you count the number of petals on a flower, you'll often find the total to be one of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, lilies and irises have three petals, buttercups and wild roses have five, delphiniums have eight petals and so on. Take a good look at yourself in the mirror. You'll notice that most of your body parts follow the numbers one, two, three and five. You have one nose, two eyes, three segments to each limb and five fingers on each hand. The proportions and measurements of the human body can also be divided up in terms of the golden ratio. DNA molecules follow this sequence, measuring 34 angstroms long and 21 angstroms wide for each full cycle of the double helix. Even a breaking wave on a beach resembles the Fibonacci sequence when graphed. Coincidence? I think not. \n\nGolden Ratio: A Fibonacci Spiral can be created by using the Golden Ratio (equal to around 1.68). This is a phenomenon that's found in nature. A plant's leaves grow so as many as possible can spiral up the stem. A new leaf only forms after the one proceeding it has formed. This pattern is observed in many objects in nature such as: The nautilus seashell, the spiral cacti, the very spiral galaxies, and sunflowers. This ratio is also important to not only how humans view one another, but also in how their bodies work. The human body and facial construction are considered beautiful the closer the features and bone structures are to the Golden Ratio. For example, many view beauty when one’s nose is 1.68 times the length of the mouth. Take a look at your finger. You observe that the first part connected close to your knuckle is 1.68 times the length of the next segment. The final segment closest to your fingernail is 1.68 times the length of your fingernail. Even involuntary muscle contractions in your body revolve around a Fibonacci Spiral. Again, coincidence? I think not. \n\nThat is the text as it was sent and argued to me. \n\nI don't have any direct questions really, I was more or less hoping to get a clear-up on the source material and the science of it. When he and I debated, I focused more on the logic of it and whether or not it held up, as I am mostly unfamiliar with the hard science of it all. \n\nI appreciate responses so far, and I thank you for giving me your time! \n\nI will update you all after he and I meet next, for our debate will continue.

Why do we need a term for those who don't ascribe ancient superstitions to things that are unknown? \n\nWhen people ask me if I believe in god, I just say I don't have any religion, and leave it at that. I don't call myself an atheist because, to me, that means I've made a choice not to believe in something, instead of what it is: I've made no choice to believe something. ",

        "text": "Recently Seth McFarlane aired this episode of [Family Guy](http://mooshare.biz/qhbsb4tr4wlv).\n\nAs is not to be surprising, the Christian community is outraged with their portrayal of Jesus. \n\nHere's a brief synopsis:\n\n&gt;  The fall finale which aired Dec. 7 on Fox, was titled “The 2000 Year-Old Virgin.” In the episode Peter and his wife Lois find Jesus at the mall; still in Quahog because Jesus and His father God don’t get along. Jesus tells Peter he “can’t deal with [His] family during the holiday.” Besides, even if Jesus did get along with God they couldn’t spend the holiday together anyway because “[His] Dad always spends Christmas at his time share … with His girlfriend.” (God appears in a scene on vacation with his scantily clad girlfriend mocking an adult handicapped child whose parents sarcastically thank him for the “test” God gave them.) \n\n&gt;Since Jesus is alone for the holiday Peter invites Jesus to get a beer with his friends where they decide to throw Jesus a birthday party- Christmas being Jesus’ birthday is the only piece of truth in the episode. While discussing the party it is discovered that Jesus knows nothing about sex and is, [GASP] a 2000 year-old virgin! The guys only come to this realization because Jesus is depicted as ignorant when it comes to sex. When asked what kind of women Jesus likes He answers, “hot ladies, horny ones who … sex on you … yeah you know they come over to your house and sit on your…butt.”\n\n&gt;Peter then makes it his mission to get Jesus laid for his birthday to end his 2000-year dry spell. Peter and bumbling idiot Jesus strike out in several attempts. Jesus eventually falls for Peter’s wife Lois, offering Peter the expensive massage chair he’d been wanting at the mall in exchange for letting him sleep with Lois, who agrees.\n\n&gt;Peter comes to his senses and stops the “couple” before they can do the deed. Still it isn't enough by half after an episode that takes so many shots at Christianity and the Christmas story it can’t even be counted on one hand.\n\nDo you all think he went too far? Is this a cheap shot outside of the bounds of respect? I'm interested in your thoughts. ",

Most people get indoctrinated and then don't seem to ever critically evaluate their beliefs, succumbing to the pressures of friends and family, as well as just getting busy with life.

My gut wants to jump in the ring and spew out reasons they are wrong, but I know that wouldn't accomplish anything. I feel like the best thing to do is just avoid situations where I would have to deal with stuff like this, but it isn't really that easy to do. Since I have to continue living in the bible belt for the foreseeable future, I'd like to have some sort of relationship with my friends and family, and I do enjoy most things the internet can offer, how do I best handle this frustration? Are there any books that deal with this type of issue? How do I deal with frustrated rage, combined with slapping my forehead in disbelief?\n\nEdit: I wanted to clarify that I definitely don't think all christians are stupid and I'm not overly concerned with converting anyone.

I need a place to express that and hope you all would be a kind ear.  \n\n\nMy parents are Catholic, raised their two kids Catholic, sent us to Catholic school, took us to Catholic church, strong armed me through the sacraments, and sent me off to college, probably assuming they had done their job in turning a baby into a Catholic adult. The more I learned at public Uni, the more I started to realize how wrong religion felt to me. As I began to learn more about *how* to think, and never being told *what* to think, I started to really discover myself and be freed from Catholic guilt.  \n\n\nFast forward to today. I'm now a senior and told my parents I'm an atheist about a year ago. I get a phone call today notifying me that I have a care package waiting at the Catholic Newman center. Hmm... must be some mistake. My parents know my mailing address. Surely if they bought me a gift they would have mailed it.  \n\n\nI got to the Newman center to sort this out, and the pastor there calls me out by name. \"Hey, chaotic_david lastname! Good to see you again.\" Hmm... I haven't spoken to this guy in two and a half years. Either his memory is really good or... shit. My parents put him up to this. Heeeeere we go.  \n\n\nHe tries to make small talk while someone else goes and fetches the care package. So far no pressure or awkwardness. C'mon care package retriever, don't fail me now. Yes! She hands over a gift basket with my name written on it. I thank the pastor, shake his hand, and turn to leave.  \n\n\nAmazing. They actually just wanted to make sure I got a care package. Here I was thinking there was a catch. I'm actually walking away from the church without being invited to Mass, or prodded about personal life, or asked if I need to make a confession. Thank goodness there are people kind enough to see I need that space.  \n\n\nAnd as I'm about 10 feet away from my car, I hear in the distance, \"Oh! chaotic_daivd! Wait up!\" I turn. I see the pastor running after me. There is something in his hand. What is it. Please don't be a Bible. He catches up to me and extends his hand. In it, a book titled, \"Recovering Catholic.\"   \n\n\nFuck. No. I've explained it to my parents a dozen times, and while I find it unproductive to argue about it, I'm willing to explain it again and again until they are satisfied. But bringing in a priest? A man whom I hardly know? Getting this man to do their bidding? I'm so pissed off.  \n\nHe says, \"Here, this is for you.\" I politely decline, wish him a good afternoon, and leave in my car.  \n\nMaybe it's a weird coincidence, but I'm clearly biased by my parents' previous attitudes toward my being atheist and my emotions convince me they did this. How am I to handle this if they bring it up?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nParents seem to have gotten a priest to try to convert me after coming out an atheist a year ago by luring me to a church with a gift basket.

There are direct quotes in the bible that say homosexuals should be killed.  The guy says he believes those are true.  The interviewer doesn't even know the first commandment, how does he know the pastor is \"perverting the bible?\"\n\nWhy do you think the interviewer acted in the manner he did?  Do you think he was simply ignorant?  Perhaps he is correct in that there is a different reason the pastor hates gays?  Or perhaps he is just culturally trained to reject any possibility that religion could be the problem?  Or maybe something else?\n\nEdit:  Come to think of it, it reminds me of myself telling people I'm an atheist.  I'll say something like \"I'm an atheist because there is no evidence for god.\"  They'll ask \"Why are you really an atheist?  Did something bad happen to you?  Do you hate god?\"  Regardless of how much I tell them, they assume there must be some other reason for my atheism.\n\nWhen I say \"I don't believe in god because there is no evidence for him\" ...

I thought y'all might be interested and I'm certainly interested to hear any thoughts and criticisms about my hypothesis.\n\n\nFirst, let me say that it is difficult to answer questions like \"why did such and such evolve\" because it's essentially untestable unless it involves yeast or bacteria, and even then just because it happens one way in a lab doesn't mean that it happened that way in nature. That disclaimer being written, let me say that I personally find this a very compelling subject and I'm going to provide a hypothesis that I came up with after a lot of consideration of this question.\n\n\nMy hypothesis primarily focuses on the importance of organized religion in human society. It involves the extension of evolution beyond the single organism and into the society. Just as selective pressures pushed cells towards working together to form first colonies and eventually multi-cellular organisms, many times throughout evolutionary history, animals have been pressured into working together as hives, schools, flocks, herds, prides, and eventually, societies. Humans have, arguably, the most complex social organization of any animal.\n\n\nWhen a society becomes significantly complex, and the individuals within it largely stop acting as individuals but instead primarily as members of the society, you can take a step back and consider that there exists an analogy between the survival of a society and the survival of an organism. This isn't simply a thought exercise. I would argue that, at a certain point, human societies are competing against each other for the same set of limited resources. Competing societies are subject to selective pressures just as much as competing individuals. Certain societies may have cultural traits that allow them to cope better with certain types of pressures.\n\n\nIf you assume that societies are being acted upon by natural selection, then religion can have two distinct functions in society. First, it can be an important piece of enforcing and preserving the cultural traits of the society, ensuring that that cultural traits that exist get passed from one generation to the next without changing too much. Looking at modern cases, it can be difficult to separate human culture from religion, but it is clear that in many cases the two are very closely intertwined, and that religion is often used as a way to pass cultural norms from one generation to the next.\n\n\nIn biological evolution, a trait does not have to be positive to be passed on. Neutral traits can be passed on as well. Negative traits can be passed on if paired with a positive trait that provides enough selective advantage that it outweighs the negatives (see sickle cell anemia and malaria). In the same way, some cultural traits preserved by religion that may seem negative could actually be neutral or paired with a positive trait. I would even go so far as to argue that some religious traits, like prudish stances on sexuality, may actually have had positive effects in the past, like preventing unwanted pregnancy and spread of disease in a time when technology could not deal with these important social issues.\n\n\nSecondly, and perhaps equally importantly, religion acts as a cultural marker. If societies are acting as organisms, then the the concept of 'us' vs. 'them' is incredibly important and the society needs a way to differentiate itself from outside societies. Religion provides a handy social marker that says \"We're us and they're them so let's kill them and take their stuff because everyone knows that thunder god's son was spawned when he lay with a mule, and their heretical teachings that it was a donkey is plain evil!\" This is an incredibly important function if societies are competing against each other for the same limited resources.\n\n\nCertainly, it's undeniable that religion has been an important part of the evolution of the human organism and society. In fact, I'm not aware of any human society in pre-modern times that did not have an important religious aspect to their culture. It's possible that such societies did exist in early times but if so, no record remains of one. It would be pure speculation to suggest that if such societies did exist, perhaps they were outcompeted by societies that had the cultural advantages provided by organized religion, but then again, this entire post has been entirely speculative.\n\n\n**TLDR; Religion is an important part of human social evolution providing both a mechanism to pass cultural information from generation to generation while controlling the rate of change of that cultural information, and by providing a marker that allows societies to differentiate from each other.**",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2olo7a/need_help_debating_the_historicity_of_jesus/",
        "text": "Hi guys (and gals),\n\nI'm currently debating/discussing a variety of topics with a Christian and he's decided to bring up the historicity of Jesus. Now he's a really smart guy and logical so it's not 'good enough' to bring up simple arguments. \n\nI'm hoping to recruit the group-mind to help me bring the strongest case against the historicity of Jesus (at least the Christian version). I really feel that my discussions with him can eventually lead him to question his beliefs and that he could become a massive asset to our community. I'll post his full question below for reference and to address certain points.\n\nSo if you have any sources/information related to this topic please share in the comments so I can put together the best response possible.\n\n&gt;From what I understand most of what we know about Christ comes from what is now referred to as the New Testament. Thus the first thing to establish is the credibility of the witnesses since there really isn't much other data out there. \n\n&gt;There are four gospels, written by different individuals whom the tradition upholds were St. Matthew the apostle, St. Mark, a student of St. Paul, St. Luke a Greek physician, and St. John the apostle. There's been a lot of speculation as to whether or not those really were the people writing them which I think is somewhat tangential from the point we are trying to establish. \n\n&gt;There really are only a few options with these authors, whomever they may be. First, are they telling what they know to be true? Or in other words did they just make it up? Second, is what they're telling in fact true? Or are they themselves deceived? Luke in particular, not being an eye-witness himself, must necessarily rely on the testimony of other people. Tradition upholds that his source was primarily Jesus' mother, Mary, which is probably why his account of her is the most robust between the other gospels. \n\n&gt;It seems to me, given the difference in style, and fragmented nature of their accounts that there was no direct collaboration between these authors although they may have been aware of one another's gospels. Some have speculated a \"Q\" source as being an original document from which at least the \"synoptic\" gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were drawn. However, this is probably more applying a literary analysis than an archaeological one since I don't believe any of the original texts exist. It doesn't really help determine our initial question one way or the other since we would still have to answer the two questions outlined above, although the second question would probably take on greater importance. \n\n&gt;Knowing that none of the original sources exist there is of course a couple questions that arise. First, were the original sources actually written around the time claimed? Second, how much of the originals were preserved in the copies? The most compelling argument for the fact that they were written somewhere in the first century and the text were not substantially modified comes from how they treat the destruction of the temple. The temple was destroyed and sacked in 70 AD. The Romans took particular delight in recording this. So much so that in one of the arches in Rome you can still see the scene of taking the spoils from the temple to this day. I have seen it myself. Meanwhile, throughout all of the texts which predict this, none of them ever state \"and this was fulfilled X many years after Christ's death\" despite the fact that all of the texts are relentless in pointing out how the scriptures were fulfilled. Furthermore, none of the following epistles seem to make mention of the temple being destroyed. This gives some pretty substantial evidence, granted it is only literary, that these texts were composed prior to the destruction of the temple and were kept largely intact. \n\n&gt;At the very least, it seems to me that the person in question did in fact exist. That these authors were probably not fabricating his existence and that they were deceived, at least in regards to his existence, as part of some conspiracy. \n\n&gt;An additional source of evidence is not just the epistles in which St. Paul and St. Peter references the sayings of Christ, but that it seems very implausible that a small Jewish-Greek hybrid faction arising in immediate contention within the Roman Empire could gain such momentum without the person they claim to follow did not even exist. The Romans weren't exactly a peaceable people and given that many people gave their lives on behalf of this man, at the very least it would seem he existed. The authors of the texts themselves were recorded as having suffered under the Romans.\n\n&gt;There is also the corroboration of two millennium of individuals coming to believe He did exist through various experiences, not the least of which is the testimony of faith. I imagine you would probably would be inclined to dismiss that as being reducible to other factors. However, it is worth pointing out. \n\n&gt;So did Jesus actually exist? What do you think?\n\n*edit for formatting",

        "text": "I'm a great reader of the religious/non-religious subs on reddit, and I often come across this argument; an atheist asks a christian what would happen to the christian's morals if they lost their faith and the christian says they would do whatever they pleased. This is inevitably leads to surprise, shock and disgust (see [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zrcdw/some_questions_from_a_christian_trying_to/c671kjt)).\n\n\nMy reaction to this is: really? This shocks you? *Really?* If someone lost their reason to be moral, it's shocking that they would be less moral? But what I wanted to talk about is the 'reasons' to be moral, as that is discussed. This quote gives reward as an example, but there are others, and hopefully we can get a discussion going:\n\nThese next paragraphs are about reasons to be moral, and why the christian reasons to be moral are (to me) almost identical to the atheist ones, and that's why to me, saying 'you're only moral because x' is nonsensical, because **you're** 'only' moral because x.\n\n* (Divine) reward\n\n\nI would argue many of us do good things for positive outcomes; because it makes us feel good, because other people praise us, because we will get recognition. There's no difference between a (theoretical) christian doing moral things for the sake of heaven, and a (theoretical) atheist doing moral things for the sake of applause. Either way, you're chasing rewards.\n\n* (Eternal) punishment\n\nI would also argue that the main reason people don't do bad things is fear of consequences. Fear of being caught. I think that the idea that people don't need a authoritarian figure to get them to behave is just naive (because you've already got an authoritarian figure. It's called the authorities). People break the law when they think they can get away with it, but unless mental illness or drugs come into play, they are probably less likely to do it.\n\nMany atheists say they do not do bad things because they want to belong in a social group/civilized society. They can't murder/rape because they would be kicked out. In which case, they are motivated by fear of exclusion. It is that simple. Fear is not, and has never been, religion's monopoly. It is the best organisation tactic ever made by multicellular life (possibly single cellular life too, what do I know?)\n\n* Meaning\n\nA less talked about area, but certainly one of relevance here, is the idea that your internal thoughts and feeling matter, and that subjective opinions are important. You believe this for your own reasons;  *some* christians believe this because they are god-given. We are all using our feelings of empathy here, but the reasons for valuing that empathy is different. If empathy, and all the rest, are not god-given, then (to *some* christians) they are opinionated bullshit, and moral nihilism reigns supreme. In which case, you *can* do whatever you wish, because nothing matters. \n\nSorry if this has turned into wall of text. But I found it too interesting not to comment.\n\n\nTL; DR The reasons that atheists and christians do good things are very similar (just that the atheists think the rewards/punishments/meaningfulness are temporary; though you may believe in leaving a 'legacy' of good deeds). There is rarely 'only' one reason a person is motivated to act, and the reasons may be varied. What are your motivations for acting, and are they so different from christian motivations (some of which are given here)\n\nEDIT2: Sorry, classic case of knowing what I mean, not knowing how to communicate it; the reason 'only' is in quotation marks is because no action is done for one reason; I don't believe atheists do moral things only for one reason, or only one of these reasons, or only any of *these* reasons; I'll just trying to illustrate that the reasons christians do moral things can be very similar to reasons atheists sometimes do things.\n\nEDIT3: going to bed, will reply to the answers tomorrow, if I have time.\n\nEDIT4: I'm off for 3 days, so by all means, keep discussing!",

I'll attempt to respond as I can. I think questions are definitely worth thinking through, but honestly I also think that there's a limit to how much can be gained from knowledge and education. So although these are huge life questions that need answers, I don't think I can spend my whole life thinking about the questions. I think I am also called to live in this world and to take action every day to love God and those around me, which limits the amount of time I can devote to other things. Could we do this discussion via email? That way I would check it more haha. My email is (removed) \nIn general (this is somewhat unrelated to the posts above) I would say that there needs to be a balance between how much we attempt to \"figure things out\" and how much we accept based on \"faith\". Ultimately, none of us will ever have a perfect theology, but I think we have a responsibility to live our lives out of a love for God and for those around us. \nMy issue with the idea that science is figuring out the world is that the more we seem to unpack the world, the more we realize how much there is that don't know. So yes, it is true that we have made a lot of scientific advances over the past years (as stated by Neil deGrasse Tyson), but I don't think that there is an ever-receding pocked called God. In fact, I find that the more we learn, the more I am in awe of how much more there is to know and how much more complex the world is. To me, this is a divine mystery. That points me to God.\"\n\nEdited for Rule 3: \n1) How can I get him to see that questioning is important in regards to his beliefs\n\n2) That while science may not know all the answers it's constantly finding out more answers.

It bothered me because I was sitting here getting toys and what not while other kids couldn't enjoy what I enjoyed. It wasn't guilt, I just didn't want them to go without what I enjoyed. I was also bothered by the fact that my parents would sometimes spend a lot of money on presents for me every year.\n\nThere's also people who spend Christmas alone because they have no family. I think that's really sad.\n\nAnother part that bothers me is just how stressful Christmas especially at my age. All the chaos of relatives coming over, Christmas shopping, money, also balancing school and work.\n\nLastly and I know I may sound like a grinch saying this, but I just really hate Christmas music, movies and decorations...

        "text": "I originally posted this elsewhere a while back and really didn't get a proper response or discussion on it.  I figured you guys might be interested in this.\n\n-----------------\n\nI'm sure one or many philosophers have covered this, and put it far more eloquently than I could possibly ever state it, but the more and more I think about religious reasoning and arguments about evil, god's plan, and free will, the more I'm finding a critical flaw in that line of reasoning.\n\nFirst let's establish some fair assumptions about what all/most Christians (or even other deistic religions that follow the same style of logic) believe:\n\nThere is a God. He is all powerful and all knowing. He has a master plan.\n\nFor the sake of my argument we are going to say we live in this universe with those three points being undeniable truths.\n\nFirst, free will. The concept of free will in a religious sense says God doesn't create bad people, bad things, or hurt anyone, but by evil brought about by the ability of humans to make their own decisions. Even natural disasters are either discretely explained away or, sometimes more boldly, blamed as a retribution for a sin. When confronted with a situation of why God lets bad things happen to good people, believers will often state that \"God works in mysterious ways\" or that it was all a part of \"God's plan\".\n\nNow remember that God has a plan; it was the third truth in this universe we created. The second truth was that God is all powerful and all knowing. We won't worry about the all power for this part of the discussion and just focus on the all knowing aspect of God's abilities. All knowing, or omniscience if you will, in this case doesn't just mean that if you met God on the street and played a game of \"guess the number I'm thinking\" that God would answer correctly with \"Seven.\" It goes much deeper than that. Omniscience means that God always knew you were going to think seven. Before you were born, before your parents were born, before your country was founded, before He created the heavens and the earth, He knew that you, [insert your name here], were going to think the number seven. There was no other number at that exact time when that exact question was asked because He knew it.\n\nWith this scenario we start to realize that an all knowing God, in a universe that has a predestined plan, there is no actual free will. One could argue that humans still have free will and are making those choices, but without the ability for history as we know it to unfold any differently because God saw it all at the beginning of time, free will really isn't a valid argument in God's opinion of or actions upon humanity. Could anything be done for Judas' actions? Or Hitler's? Or various other evil doers of history? Judas was always going to betray Jesus. Hitler was always going to be the terror of Europe and its minorities. God has always existed, and He has always known that these events were going to pass exactly as they did. With that kind of realization, the idea that parts of God's plan being punishments for something else seem unlikely as God would have essentially laid out the cosmically universal punishments before the earth he created even existed, let alone the people to later walk it and commit these sins.\n\nIn essence, there is no true free will in a universe with an all knowing God who has perfect foresight.\n\nSecondly, the point of prayer being useless. In this universe remember that there is a God, it's the first truth that was established. This takes the previous scenario of God being all knowing when it comes to Judas or Hitler or any other event and goes the next step with it. These events, as terrible as they may seem, are going to come to pass. God has seen it. God knows what will be. If events were to come about any differently, He would have already seen it and it would have already happened or will happen, in that fashion.\n\nWith that idea in mind prayer in this universe would be unnecessary and/or wasted. Again, a human praying for God's intervention on an event that has occurred or may occur in the future is inconsequential. Praying will not do anything because what has, is, and will happen already happened as God saw it... always... even before humanity existed. The very presence of an all knowing God with a divine plan nullifies prayer. Praying and not praying have an equal outcome, even in this universe where we are all agreeing that God exists and His power is great.\n\nAlso, it's not just that prayer is useless. It's a concept that God has any faltered judgement or reconsideration in any event. That is simply impossible for an all knowing God. The Bible even makes this glaring error from time to time, stating that God \"started to rethink\" humanity leading to Noah and the flood. God doesn't \"rethink\". God can't rethink. There's nothing to think about from God's perspective. Again, He's always known of the fall of Adam, the hedonism of Man that He is going to purge with a great flood, he knew all of this before humanity was even created.\n\nIn summary, free will cannot exist because God knows what our choices will be and the outcomes of those choices, both as a single person and being part of a larger entity (family, neighborhood, country, world region, etc.) before any human was even alive to make them. If God ever influenced humanity ever it was because he saw himself doing it, not as a reaction to a choice. Prayer is also inconsequential on the same grounds. Someone praying in the moment for a past, present, or future event has no baring on an all knowing God's plan that was seen eons before it was ever relevant.\n\nI welcome discussions and criticisms.\n\nThank you",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI'm in Texas. 3 of my kids are in **public** school (ages 8, 9, &amp; 10). It's also worth noting, for context, that my kids have been repeatedly picked on by other children because we're very openly atheist. My kids are free to think for themselves, but they genuinely don't think there's a god. We do attend a UU Church, so they're exposed to all sorts of concepts and ideas and beliefs, but they are still atheists. There's been some minor comments from teachers that i found inappropriate (asking them if they go to church, asking them if they believe in god), but it never escalated to preaching, so I've left well enough alone. \n\n\n\nWe often, at least a couple times a month, receive some sort of advertisement from the school for a local church and events that they host. Usually it's vague enough that I don't think I could rightly complain very much about it. Still, it's a bit annoying when every other Friday (or more) they bring their weekly folders home, and it contains something from a church. \n\n\nToday, I feel like it's escalated, and would like some advice. I was emailed [this flyer](http://i.imgur.com/4yMunKa.png) (identifying info redacted, obvs.). This is the first time I've received a direct email, it's also the first one that's made direct mention of Jesus or any other character/deity they believe in. To me, this crosses a line. It says it's not sponsored by our school district at the bottom, but, I mean, it's getting emailed to me by a school employee from a school email address. \n\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on how to handle this? Or am I wrong for thinking this is a bit out of line? \n\n\n**EDIT:** Per suggestion, I've contacted the FFRF. Hopefully they can help with this situation. \n\n**EDIT 2:** In an unrelated incident today, this clusterfuck school actually kept one of my kids late without my consent. 2 came home, 1 did not - I had to go up there and found out it was for a dress rehearsal for their winter play (which is full of songs that mention God, btw - my kids want to do the play anyhow, and I'm allowing it, but I didn't consent to dress rehearsal.)... I explicitly denied my consent when they sent home forms about this before Thanksgiving break, because I had plans today, but apparently they don't care much about consent. It wasn't just my kid either, several other parents had to come retrieve their children because they were kept when they weren't supposed to. Ridiculous. I've contacted the Principal, the Assistant Principal, the Superintendent. If I had the time and energy I'd homeschool again. ",

He of course completely leaves out the part of the story where God strikes the baby dead for Davids sin. It was presented in a much softer \"the baby got sick\" sort of way. \n\nI've been going to church with my wife for years and part of me (the really dumb part) just wants to rush the stage and give these folks just a tiny taste of reality.

        "text": "\"Remember what it was like before you were born? Death is going to be a lot like that.\" \n\nAs an atheist, lacking any opposing evidence, I truly believe this. My life, even if I reach 100 years old, will be short. On the grand scheme of things, it means nothing. Nothing I can do or will ever do will make a lasting impact on mankind.  No one will be talking about me in a century, much less 5 years after I'm gone.  And even if I manage to do something that will make a 1,000 year impact, so what? I won't be around to experience it, enjoy it, appreciate it, revel in it.  \n\nI am scared of death. I don't want to go away. I am not ready and I can't foresee a time when I will *want* to die. But I want to live long enough to find that out. Except, I won't. \n\nAnd that's the point. Consciousnesses and (by extension) my experiences, is really all that matters from my point of view. Everything after I die is irrelevant to me because I won't be here to make them relevant, to experience them.\n\nTherefore, I do what I want and, ultimately, I care only about me. Do I care about my family? Sure. Would I take a bullet to save their life? No. Why would I? I wouldn't be around to appreciate that fact. Or to appreciate anything. Since I can only see the world through my eyes, literally, then I need to ensure that goes on as long as possible.\n\nSo that's where I am going with this post, I suppose. Maybe the realization of my own mortality has me in a  state of shock that I can't shake off. But it's something I am finding out about myself more and more as time goes on, and the idea of my own mortality begins to creep into my thoughts more consistently as time goes on. This is my reaction to the sword of damocles; death. And it has me scared. \n\nHas anyone else here had (or have) a similar mentality due to the permanence of death (and the lack of an afterlife)?",

Anyway, I just wanted to ask you folks' opinion on my situation, and how I ought to handle it.\n\nI'm 19 years old, and attending a fundamentalist Christian college (liberal arts college, planning to attend medical school). I don't want to be here; I'm here because my parents will not cover health insurance, life insurance, college tuition, or any other costs if I attend any secular schools. I've been an atheist for perhaps two years, and only recently told my father. He and I have always been close, and I doubt this will drive a wedge between us. \n\nHe will never, under any circumstances, help me if I decide to attend a regular school. I'm considering waiting until junior year and transferring, but many of my credits will not transfer with me unless the school gets accredited. \n\nAnyway, my problem is that I really, really want to attend a state college where I can have freedom of both religion and speech as well as more secular volunteer opportunities. As it stands, I have to hide my lack of belief for fear of being forced to attend counseling and being under permanent suspicion, since teachers' relationship with students is important here, due to the small nature of the college. I'll have a very hard time getting into any impressive programs without their help, and they'll always give Christian students preference.\n\nHow can I, hopefully next fall, attend a state school without working full time and without my parents' assistance in any way, shape, or form? I need to spend many hours studying, and I'm trying my best for scholarships. If I have to work full-time, I'll never get the GPA I need for medical school, but if I stay here, I'll have to live a lie for another several years. As you can imagine(and many have surely experienced), it's very damaging for the psyche.\n\nThanks for reading, and I appreciate your responses.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention two things: The school is trying to get accredited, and will very likely succeed, and their pre-med program has a very high medical school acceptance rate, around double the national average. That's because they kick out most of those who don't have enough extracurriculars and such, but it still says something of the quality.",

Less so as the years go on and my thoughts become more and more set on a deterministic attitude and I find myself becoming too skeptical to even wonder at the possibility of anything supernatural. But my last attempt at finding spirituality was in Buddhism. It seemed like a good option for me; their mainstream western culture embraces empirical science, discourages faith, and the religion has morals that resonate with me. Compassion for everything that feels pain is something I liked in particular. The idea that you are not more worthy than any other animal on the planet for happiness sounds great on paper, and it's a moral I embrace. However, knowing that my continued existence is dependent upon a great deal of other things having to die for me leads me to an unexpected logical conclusion. Why should I continue to live if other creatures that have an equal right to happiness need to die so that it can happen? Even if I were to become a vegan, many animals would be killed in cultivating the land for crops I would eat, and more would die of the poison food storage facilities put down to keep the animals such as mice from eating the food. Now this is likely a thought born of the suicidal thoughts I've struggled with for years. If you were here with me, you would see on the floor to my left is a helium tank attached to a plastic oven bag via a medical rubber hose. On the floor next to the tank, is an organ donor card and will. I don't think I need to explain to you what these items are for, and I bought them before I came to this logical conclusion about my morality.\n\n\nWhat I wanted to ask other atheists is if you had any interesting moral conclusions that you've come to in your life as an atheist. Do you feel like your morals are compatible with your continued existence? Do you feel that humanity is 'good' even though we are killing off so many other species and causing climate change that will cause even more extinction?\n\nThanks for reading this, I'm looking forward to reading your answers.\n\n\nJust to be clear, I don't see atheism as having inherent moral qualities, or to mean anything other than a lack of belief in a god or gods. I'm just asking the atheist community this question because I am an atheist, and am curious what other atheists have to say about it.\n\n\nEdit: I define happiness as a lack of suffering, as opposed to joy or pleasurable feelings as many other people do.",

I hope you can help me on this particular question.\n\nWhere I work, religions are considered public service. So I work with a lot people, and a lot of atheists. Which is nice: a lot of interesting discussions, as long as everyone understands the unspoken rule that nobody should try to convert anyone.\n\nBut here's my problem. As a catholic, I (usually) stand on the Vatican's side. Now, everyone can disagree about what the Vatican says.  You can call its stances bullshit. \n\nBut... there's a huge amount of things the people *believe* are held by the Vatican that are just lies, misconceptions, stereotypes and/or misinformation. A sentence beginning with the words \"The Vatican thinks/says that...\" states a fact. A fact that can easily be proven wrong or right by checking www.vatican.va .\n\nSome of the people I meet do not understand that. When I call them out (\"You're wrong, the Vatican does not think that\"), their answer are usually something like:\n\n- \"What the Vaticans think is bullshit anyway\"\n\n- \"That's what they think deep down but they're masquerading as a politically correct institution\"\n\n- \"Some catholics think that, so it must be the official stance\"\n\nYou can see how it does not change the fact that their initial sentence was wrong.\n\nHere are some examples. **Edit as requested, I've added the evidence one can dig up with simple fact cheking** \"The Vatican believes...\n\n- ...that condoms spread AIDS\" [first result of searching \"condom\", point 2](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_20031201_family-values-safe-sex-trujillo_en.html#ChurchCriticism) That sentence is out of context. But I believe the context may make a valid point.\n\n- ...that non-catholics are automatically bad people and will go to hell\" [chapter named \"Hell\" in the catechism, number 1037](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2O.HTM#2)\n\n- ... that science is an enemy of religion\"\n [second result in searching the word \"science\" in the catechism, number 159](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_PX.HTM#HH)\n\n- ... that women are worthless\"\n [chapter named \"Male and Female He created them\"number 369](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P1B.HTM#X7)\n\n- ... that everything in the bible is to be taken literally\" \n[chapter named \"Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture\" number 108](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PP.HTM)\n\n- ... that you can justify anything just by citing a bible verse\"\n (same as the one before)\n\n- ... that the pope is a God/demi-God\"\n[I searched for hierarchy, and then \"pope\" in the first chapter that popped out. number 882](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM)\n\n\nThe most recent example is [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2nrthk/pope_francis_we_must_condemn_those_who_use/) on reddit with a misleading title, saying the pope calls for a crusade.\n\n\nWhat could I say to make them understand my point? I'm always happy to discuss about religions. But it's not very interesting when you can't get past stereotypes. There's a lot of reasons to hate the catholic church, there's no need in making more up.\n\n**Edit**\nThanks for your answers. Some are really useful. I knew that an atheist point of view could show me things I missed.\n\nI'm not here to argue about those specific points, it's already hard enough to do that in my mothertongue, and I don't think it's the right thread to do that.\n\n**Edit 2**\n\nThanks a lot! I have a lot to study, and a lot to think. I'm always impressed by your respect and your politeness, I guess it's a good occasion to say out loud. Sorry if most of my answers are shorter than I'd like them to be. I really appreciate that you took the time to help me.",

Why?\n\nMe: Well I just realized that every baby that is born is an atheist until their Muslim parents tell them Mohammed is real and the Koran is true, or their Christian parents tell them Jesus is real and the Bible is true, or their Hindu parents tell them Vishnu is real and the Rigveda is true. So usually people just believe in the god that they do because their parents taught them it at a young age. Then of course their are people who weren't raised with religion but come to it at an older age and it is almost always used as a security blanket type thing, like someone lost a loved one and they want to believe they will see them again, or had a near death experience and decide something \"chose\" for them to live. That is all fine, imo, everyone is free to believe whatever helps them get through life. But I feel that because something helps someone cope with life doesn't make the thing literally true.\n\n",

She's the kind of Christian that can't really understand how someone could be happy without God or without religion, all atheists are soulless and lead dark, cold lives, etc etc etc. She's not very respectful of his beliefs or problems, despite him being as accommodating and respectful as possible towards hers. He has really serious depression and anxiety, and she's extremely dismissive and disrespectful of that. She's said things like \"if you believed in God you wouldn't be depressed,\" yelled at him for \"disrespecting her religion\" while he's having a panic attack and said \"oh my god\" or something like that, said that he's \"making her choose between her religion and her best friend,\" lots of awful things I can't recall right now. I know, it sounds bad overall and he should lose her, but he's really serious about this girl and suggesting that would most definitely alienate him from me. Despite her being kind of awful to him a lot, he relies on her a lot for happiness and if they broke up he'd be completely destroyed and possibly at risk for hurting himself. I've sort of become an older sister-type friend to him, being slightly older and having more life experience, and I've been trying to help him but I'm kind of out of ideas. Any help?",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2nzj1f/on_the_absence_of_evidence/",
        "text": "Anyone else encountered this frustrating apologetic?\n\n\n\"May I see the evidence of your claim, please?\"\n\n\"Actually, no. Aside from highly personal revelations and spiritual experiences that are all highly subjective and that I cannot prove, I have no evidence to offer you: but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, so my belief is still a completely rational one to hold!\"\n\n\nThe popular rebuttal: \"absence of evidence IS evidence for absence, where evidence is expected\", can be taken a step further with Christianity/Judaism: \"absence of evidence is evidence of absence... where evidence is **promised**\"\n\nI like how Judaism (correctly) recognised the impotence of idols, and it is refreshing to see that it was because of a lack of \"proof\" that the idols were happily be denounced, dismissed and discarded as \"nothing at all\":\n\n&gt;Set forth your case, says the Lord;\n\n&gt;bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.\n\n&gt;Let them bring them, and tell us\n\n&gt;what is to happen.\n\n&gt;Tell us the former things, what they are,\n\n&gt;so that we may consider them,\n\n&gt;and that we may know their outcome;\n\n&gt;or declare to us the things to come.\n\n&gt;Tell us what is to come hereafter,\n\n&gt;that we may know that you are gods;\n\n&gt;do good, or do harm,\n\n&gt;that we may be afraid and terrified.\n\n&gt;You, indeed, are nothing\n\n&gt;and your work is nothing at all;\n\n&gt;whoever chooses you is an abomination.\n\n&gt; – Isaiah 41:21-29\n\nAnd I like that the text gives approval to the mocking of pagan gods for being silent, absent and impotent:\n&gt; At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.” Then they cried aloud and, as was their custom, they cut themselves with swords and lances until the blood gushed out over them. As midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was **no voice, no answer, and no response**.\n\n&gt; – 1 Kings 18:27-29\n\nReading their own book we can see what kind of evidence was expected, by their own standard, of a god that actually exists. It should be able to tell us about the \"former things\" for us to consider (launching nicely into an evaluation of the Genesis creation myth, and how far short it falls when considered it against the scientific discoveries of the last few centuries); it should be able to make predictions of the future (launching nicely into an examination of failed prophecies); it should be active: doing good or harm (launching nicely into the impotence of prayer, and the review of broken promises); it should have a voice - Elijah expected to hear the voice of Baal if he was real, so the voice needs to be audible not just to the already-faithful; it should answer and actively respond when called upon.\n\n\nThese are all testable evidences; evidences that would manifest in the physical world. These tests were enough for Elijah to \"prove\" that Baal wasn't a real god, and oversee the slaughter of Baal's followers. He wouldn't have cared at all had the acolytes of Baal claimed to have Baal's (un)holy spirit residing within them and witnessing in a \"self-authenticating\" manner; he wouldn't have cared has they tried to claim that Baal refusing to send fire was in fact a legitimate answer to prayer ('No' or 'Wait', instead of the desired 'Yes'); he wouldn't have cared if they pointed to the well-needed rain the previous week, or the continued survival of their tribe, or the existence of love, or logic, or whatever. No, Baal was silent, absent and impotent, and that was enough for Elijah to dismiss him as not being real.\n\n\nAny Christian or Jew crying: \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence!\" has stories like these, in their own sacred texts, to look to when deciding whether that's a legitimate and biblical defence. Do they think Elijah was wrong, and that he should have accepted that the lack of of tangible evidence was not good enough of a reason to think that Baal was fictional? Do they think he should have gone: \"Well, I suppose I really haven't *disproven\" Baal today, I suppose it's still within the realms of possibility; fine, I'll let ya'll live!\"? Surely they don't think this righteous prophet of Yahweh was wrong or unjust, so why - when faced with a silent, absent and impotent god today - do they defend the \"possibility\" of his existence with such unbiblical ideas?",

        "text": "I'm not sure what or why i'm trying to post; I might just want this off my chest and somewhere on the internet. Little background on myself: \n\n* In my late 20s, grew up in a Hindu family mostly in the United States\n\n* Started questioning religion in my teens during high school, skepticism grew over college. Studied molecular/cellular biology, also read textbooks on evolutionary biology/psychology and other religions during college. \n\n* Currently study medicine and PhD post-graduate. Also pretty much atheist at this point (although I don't like to get into the semantics and labeling of my beliefs into a category. Essentially I don't ascribe myself to things for which there are no evidence). \n\nDespite my atheism, I don't really have a problem with religious people at all. My simple philosophy is that you believe whatever you wish, regardless of the evidence supporting it, as long as it doesn't lead to decisions and actions that impede/hurt you or others. However, I am upset with most organized religion, because it seems to be brainwashing people into making inappropriate decisions or waste resources inappropriately. Hinduism is sometimes an extreme case -- I am surprised the extent to which religious thought permeates through everyone's lives and decisions. The entire culture is in some way influenced by religious tradition and rituals. It appears to be much more so than here in the United States, partly because it is secular and also because there is a diversity of religion. At least where I grew up in India, religious shrines are everywhere. \n\nMy parents are quite religious; my mom, especially. I have counted at least 60 pictures/statues of deities and gurus/mystics in their house. I haven't explicitly explains my beliefs to them at this point. But here are some things my parents do that drive me crazy: \n\n* Place statues/pictures of deities/gurus in my apartment every time they come (up to 15 at my place now). \n\n* Bring homeopathic remedies and beg me to take them for my ailments (I'm not really sick, actually. I get some stomach pains and rashes once in a while). \n\n* Ask me to take ayurveda (herbal medicine) and perform yoga. (Granted, these things can be beneficial for my health, but I stay in pretty good shape. I run/lift almost every day. Also re: ayurveda, I am already a student in western medicine. My reading on ayurveda has not convinced me that it is a useful approach to disease).  \n      * Side note: They also receive advice from their acupuncturist and relay their advice to me and ask me to try. No, I'm not going to eat 1 pound of cabbage a day to get healthier, wtf. \n\n* Beg me to get married because my astrological sign (called jathagam) dictates it, and has placed a deadline that if I miss, I will have bad luck and misfortune. P.S. Anyone I marry will also get astrological reading to determine compatibility. \n\n\nNormally I am pretty tolerant of their beliefs, but I feel like I'm going to SNAP. They are trying to control MY life based on their strong beliefs, most of which is based on VERY bad evidence. I have tried explaining SOME of the things to them (i.e. astrology and homeopathy since they aren't associated their very core values like their belief in god). I was slow and gentle in explaining how you can't follow these things without evidence, but they weren't having it. It doesn't sink in. Ever. Every anecdote they have heard that affirms their belief FAR reinforces their notions than any evidence to the contrary. Homeopathy/acupuncture worked for *someone*, so it's worth trying. I wouldn't argue those heuristics if it was cheap, but they're not that cheap. They've shut their minds off to new beliefs, so I have given up trying to \"convert\" them in any way.\n\nAnyway, I just want them to trust ME with my decisions and that I have my own \"rational\" method for evidence-based decision making in my life. It's not perfect, but it's what I believe. I don't think I'm especially anti-religious, but I think BECAUSE they are my parents, I am becoming particularly intolerant to their beliefs. I don't know if it's worth to expose myself and my whole set of beliefs, which might break their heart and worry them more. Here's the crazy part: My parents AREN'T that devout Hindus. My dad actually eats beef, etc. They are okay with me dating non-Indian girls (although it does probably bother them that I'm not, but at least I'm not gay, right? *rolls eyes*). There are much more fundamentalist and devout Hindus in our social groups that go to the temple every other day, perform an hour+ ritual almost every week. My parents aren't that bad in the grand scheme of traditional Hindu practice (which drives home the point of how amazing deep the ritualistic aspect of Hinduism can become). \n\nAnyway, I have been going to the temple with them and praying with them no questions asked every year. My mom tells me to pray every day, and light lamps at the mini-shrine she built in my apartment to ward off evil. I am asked to take days off work or drive home for hours because of \"a important religious Hindu holiday\" to perform rituals I don't believe in. I do all these things to keep my mom at peace. But how far do I have to keep living this lie for her peace of mind? When should I bring up the fact that these things aren't important to me? \n\n\nSorry about this rant. Just getting things off my chest. Phew! I'll probably come back to edit this and to clarify some of my points. I've been thinking about my beliefs lately and how it fits in with my family, profession, friends, and society as a whole. Outside of the family, I've been feeling pretty clear on how I feel about my beliefs. ",

Lately, my sister-in-law who she loves with her heart has been indoctrinating her, and I wish there was a better word for what's going on, but there isn't. \n\nSome backstory: My older brother was always religious but never really cared or thought too much about it. He just was. After he started dating his current zealot of a fiancée, things changed and he became much more religious. My mom too was very religious, but she's passed away a few years ago. After she did, my father became increasingly less religious and has been rekindling his interest in science, most recently watching the Cosmos series with NdGT, however he is also completely apathetic in regards to my sister's... How shoud I put it? \"Faith education\". He sends her to sunday school simply because that's the way things are. Children go to Sunday school, no questions asked. If all that wasn't enough, our cleaning lady who happens to be her sitter, is a born-again christian that doesn't help her situation.\n\nAs you can see, she's completely surrounded by ignorance and people that claim that \"if we evolved from monkeys, how come there are still monkeys?\" is a valid argument. She used to really like science class, which she now hates.\n\nHow can I go about it? I can't do anything too direct like confronting my Sister in law or asking my father to take her out of Sunday school because this is bound to get me in trouble, as my atheism is known to all, but it's an issue that's sweeped under the rug. Out of sight, out of mind. I normally don't mind this kind of behaviour because it only affects me, but now that it's affecting my sister, I need to do something.\n\nI was thinking of giving her a copy of \"The Magic of Reality\", which I really liked, for christmas, but I really don't think it's Dawkins' best work, as it comes out a bit stiff  for a children's book.\n\nAny form of help on how to deal with this situation is very much appreciated.\n\nTLDR: Need help rekindling my sister's curiosity while she's surrounded by incredibly religious people.\n\n**Edit:** My sister speaks very little english so I need something that either is translated or is general advice that doesn't rely on material.

So how do you guys claim to know Christianity isn't true. The fact that it could be has been driving me crazy for the last year. Everyday I think I bout. Just reading through apologetic arguments. I also see a bunch of ex atheist posting on the Christian subreddit. My brain keeps telling me to message every single one of them to ask what convinced them. It's driving me crazy this constant fear is just eating away at me, I really just don't know what to do anymore.  Thanks. I guess what I'm looking for is the best evidence you have that could dismiss Christianity ",

        "text": "First off - by no means take anything I say here as an indictment of anyone in the atheist community.  I have an opinion but I'm keeping it to myself.  So any 'tone' you may read into this post please ignore.\n\nI just finished watching a talk by Heina Dadabhoy about atheism and debates.  It was 'ok' imho.  When I got to the end of it, though, I wondered to myself how I got to watching her.  \n\nWhat I'm driving at is that I've read and watched a lot of 'prominent' atheists (I hate that term).  Most of them bring something to the table with them.  Hitchens brought his rhetorical gift, Ehrman is a degreed theologian, Dawkins an eminent biologist, and so on.  But lately there have been a few people speaking up - like Dadabhoy and, say, Jaclyn Glenn who I've listened to but have no idea why their opinion should matter.\n\nI'm used to this sort of thing when it comes to Youtube channels and subscriptions - heck, anyone can have that - The Angry Atheist, The Armored Skeptic, etc.  But we don't really take those people seriously in the public sphere (at least I don't).\n\nAre no 'credentials' required to go out debating these days?  That's fine, I suppose.  If atheism were a 'community' I'd say we would have to be more selective about who 'represents' us but atheism, in my view, is just a single position on a single topic.  \n\nAll the same, I'm not sure if just being an 'ex-muslim' qualifies you to go out and debate anyone.  \n\nOr does it?  Or does just breathing air qualify you?  I'm not sure.  It just seems to me that people are turning 'being atheist' into a career these days and there seems to be no qualifications required.  I worry about this because if you put the wrong person in front of a camera these days you can negatively influence public opinion considerably.\n\nI'd be interested to hear what you guys have to say about this.  Personally I prefer to listen to philosophers, theologians, cosmologists, etc.  I learn something from them.  ",

Is it even a winnable battle?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the responses, addressing several of your comments, I don't mean in response to hateful and harsh atheistic comments (I can understand it completely in that case), I meant when these are responses to reasonable, calm ones such as those made in this sub. \n\nTLDR: How we can work to change the negative stereotypes that accompany atheism on reddit?",

I ask this because I find myself from time to time saying things like \"May I keep my cool during this presentation\" or \"let [my SO's] flight arrive safely.\" I do not consider myself to be speaking to a deity of any kind, just sort of silently expressing a hope to the universe. And it sometimes makes me feel better. Perhaps it's just a vestige of my former Christian beliefs, but I'm curious what others think/do in this regard.\n\nI've also done some reading on the role of prayer in Buddhism and it seems that the definition there is much broader, not narrowly defined as speaking to God, but just, maybe, talking to oneself.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

She's not very religious (I can't think of the last time we went to church), but we have a six month old, and my wife keeps making comments like 'I want our daughter to grow up in church'. I'm not sure what to do; do I tell my wife how I feel and risk ruining our relationship? If I have to suffer through a church service every week, I will. I'm not willing to fuck up my marriage to come clean about my faith...my wife and daughter are more important to me than anything, so I'll live a lie if I have to. I feel like my wife would understand if I'm honest with her...she's been openly critical of the church / bible in the past, but this is a pretty sensitive topic so I'm not sure what to expect. Can somebody who's dealt with this situation tell me how it worked out for you? Any tips on how to approach the topic?",
