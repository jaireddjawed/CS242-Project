        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI've been thinking about the dice and how interesting it is that from a somewhat deterministic process we can generate seemingly random numbers. Then I got to thinking about other ways to do it and here I am with some thoughts and asking for feedback and more ideas.\n\nStatement: we want heuristics that, given N generate integers in {1,...,N} that as a sequence are close enough (for some definition of close) to a iid sequence of samples from a uniform distribution. We can use a computer (a Turing machine, whatever) but we can't cheat with it.\n\nCheat 1: Using an RNG from the computer would be cheating, so solutions of the form \"np.random\" are not allowed.\n\nCheat 2: Our heuristics should produce a value in some manifold/space, and the space should be divided in N subsets with equal Lebesgue measure. Meaning, the uniformness should come from the heuristic and not from applying some transformation (in other words, don't generate normally distributed values, which are a bit easier thanks to CLT)\n\nCheat 3: This one is more vague, but the heuristics should have some input from a human. For example, clicking a button that activates a sensor that reads the background radiation or generates a quantum state is not allowed.\n\nOther than that anything goes. The heuristics should also be robust to skills (meaning that no human could reasonably break them).\n\nMy first thought was, chaotic systems? For example, turn a knob that has very high accuracy and send a simulated ray through a series of circular mirrors. But I'm not sure how uniform that would be. So here's the first question: **Is there a measure of how well a chaotic system \"mixes\" its values after x time?** Similar to the idea of well mixing processes.\n\nThe second thought was indeed well mixing Markov chains, but not sure using mechanical systems how to achieve that other than cards or dice. Throwing balls down a sequence of pins generates a binomial, but perhaps there are ways to generate a uniform distribution that smarter people have thought about.\n\nThe third idea I had was a bit more technical: shake some sand or whatever, use a sensor or take a photo and hash it. I think it's okay, it's going to generate passable uniform distributions, but it's too close to cheat 3.\n\nFourth and final thought is, perhaps there's a way to turn one of the standard RNG methods like the Mersenne twister into a mechanical contraption. But I think anything feasible to build will have a small period and therefore the randomness will be iffy...\n\nAnyway hope someone here finds it interesting!! I'll actually try to test the ideas I can (that don't require expensive tech), so would love to get as many wacky heuristics as you can give me!",

But of all these ideas I’ve pushed to the back of my mind, this is the only one I haven’t made been able to make a dent in. So I’ve decided to share this in hopes somebody can either recognize or reassure me that this is just a coincidence.\n\nWhen solving for fixed points of the Mandelbrot set’s quadratic map, this corresponds to the number 0. For points of period 2, this corresponds to the number -1. For points of period 3, this corresponds to the roots of the polynomial equation c^3 + 2c^2 +c + 1 = 0. Now, as someone familiar with number theory, this stands out to me because this polynomial has discriminant -23. Not only does the imaginary quadratic field of discriminant -23 have class number 3, but adjoining the roots of this polynomial to this specific quadratic field yields a special extension, called the Hilbert class field.\n\nOf course I looked into it, seeing if there were any other similar phenomenon appearing in these special points but I could not reproduce this. And I don’t know what to think about it. Coincidence? Something deeper? The Mandelbrot set does have some nice arithmetic properties involving Farey addition, but does it have any other nice arithmetic properties? Maybe not.\n\nMy field is not dynamical systems, so pardon my abuse of terminology.",

Greg received his bachelors in mathematics from Harvard University in 2018 and while there won the Hoopes prize for best undergraduate thesis. He also received an Honorable Mention for the Morgan Prize for Outstanding Research in Mathematics by an Undergraduate Student in 2018 and was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians in 2019.\n\nIn this episode, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name \"Tensor Programs\" and currently spans five highly technical papers. The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT. We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7kjkdbez2aa1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=192df164621a27849f4afe3bf3e201fd6990bc23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tulheh2jz2aa1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=818f4f39a02c195426b041d29080296fcdeca53c\n\nYoutube:  [https://youtu.be/1aXOXHA7Jcw](https://youtu.be/1aXOXHA7Jcw) \n\nApple Podcasts: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cartesian-cafe/id1637353704](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cartesian-cafe/id1637353704)\n\nSpotify: [https://open.spotify.com/show/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG](https://open.spotify.com/show/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG)\n\nRSS: [https://feed.podbean.com/cartesiancafe/feed.xml](https://feed.podbean.com/cartesiancafe/feed.xml)",

The professor is using Diestel's book.   \nOn the other hand, in undergraduate algebra (a year ago) we covered rings, ideals, PID, UFDs, and Euclidean domains from Gallian's book.  For this algebra class, we're using Dummit. \n\nI haven't done the first graduate algebra course, which covers group theory and a bit of rings (chapters 1 to 7 in Dummit). I'm not sure if I could take the second course without this knowledge?\n\nI'm torn between which class I should do. Any advice?",
