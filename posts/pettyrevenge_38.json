        "text": "Not really the best petty revenge I have ever done or shared for that matter but this morning on my way to work, I was casually driving to work today actually going the Speed Limit because I have a lead foot most of the time.\n\nAnyway, it's a 3 lane road going one way, and a 3 lane going the other way and there's just a wee bit more traffic than usual. Some guy in his Charger is impatience because he can't get by me. There's a car on his left and one on his right and he starts tailgating me. \n\nI guess this is the universal signal for speed up. Usually, I slow down even further to be a dick. Which is also a bit petty but not today. You want by? I'll let you by. I speed up and let him out. He's clearly pissed so he get's next to me and I know what's about to go down. He's about to floor it to show me who's boss. This isn't my first rodeo. Little does he know that the 2005 Nissan Pathfinder I am driving is a sleeper. \n\nI guess he thought because I am in a full size SUV I was just going allow him to fly by and cut me off but my 5 liter turbo diesel isn't going to let that happen.\n\nHe punches it right on que and I floor it leaving him in the fucking dust. His rear wheel drive doesn't have the traction to grab the pavement that my 4 wheel drive does and it's over with. \n\nWe get to the next light and he gives me the finger. I roll down my window and verbally let him know that just because I wasn't going fast, doesn't mean I can't. Then I launched on his ass when the light turned green and unleashed an ungodly amount of coal right into his window.\n\nMoral of the story, don't fuck with people who can roll coal.\n\n\n",

He told me he had something planned next time paper spilled over his desk. So we’re sitting in class, and of course, as always, the paper is spilling over. My friend decides to inch his desk back a bit, subtly. Then he does it again, and again, and again, until eventually, the papers, along with the binder, water bottle, everything, goes crashing to the floor. Typically this wouldn’t be an issue, but our school had exceptionally dirty and musty floors, so all of Jimbos stuff was marked up and dusty/dirty.\n\nTL;DR\nSlacker pushes his papers onto my friends desk repeatedly, friend moves desk back, papers fall, binder falls, everything’s covered in dirt and dust.",

        "text": "This occurred in the late 90's/early 2000s, when I was in grade school.  I grew up on a street that was mostly old houses from the 1910s, and most of them were huge.  Like built originally as single family homes, but massive enough to turn into apartments or studios.  Which is what a lot of landlords did, to make a decent profit off of the kids who went to the college about 6 blocks up the street.  I think typically 6-8 kids shared one house.  One such house was directly next door, and another was down and across the street.\n\nThere was a lot of turnover in these houses as you can imagine, and it always stressed my mom and dad out to see new kids moving in.  As an adult, I now understand why.  A few times we had some really chill, nice kids living next door.  And a few times, we had total assholes living there.\n\nOne year, it was assholes.  They were hard party types who didn't care if it was the middle of the week or the middle of the night to throw an insanely loud, rowdy house party.  And when I say loud, I mean that even with our houses being separated by a large yard, we could STILL hear their bass thumping from INSIDE our house.  Sometimes until three in the morning.\n\nNow my dad is one of the most laid back and passive people I know.  He always started by going next door himself to ask them to kindly keep it down.  This particular crowd basically blew him off and if I recall, had a few colorful words for him.  Ok, fine.  Police were called.  The policy at the time, iirc, was if the police were called three separate times over the same house, a complaint was launched automatically.  These kids literally did not care, the complaint happened, and I assume the landlord gave them mild shit for it.  They quieted down for maybe a week or two, and started back up again.  I don't know how they didn't get evicted, other than the landlord cared more about money than keeping the peace in the neighborhood.  This went on all.  Fucking. Semester.  And to add to it all, the party goers would lob all their trash over the fence into OUR yard.  This include glass, which broke often.  Once there were broken beer bottles right under where my swing was.  Needless to say, my parents were not happy.  If either parent confronted these twats, they would be rude and unpleasant.  My mom began picking up their trash and throwing it back into their yard, for what good that did.\n\nThe morning after one particularly loud party,  I was out in the yard with my mom, and our dogs.  One of the dogs was a hound; this information will be relevant shortly.  I think my mom was picking up some of the trash.  It was mid-morning, and the party people were next door sleeping off their hangovers.  I had the idea of bringing one of my many pets out in its cage (honestly can't remember which one, I had a plethora of hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits growing up).  I would sometimes take the bottom off of the cages and let the critter enjoy the grass for a bit.  I did this, not thinking about our high prey drive hound being outside at the time.  He got really worked up upon seeing a small animal.  He started baying.  Loudly.\n\nNow I'm thinking oh shit, the dog is making noise, gonna take the critter back inside.  My mom glanced over, saw what was going on, and said something along the lines of, \"leave the critter out here for a bit.\"\n\nSo I kept it out of reach of the hound (who had to be on a long rope, as he would bolt and run off) and just sat there for a minute watching him incessantly bay over and over, before it dawned on me what my mom was doing.  Mind you, we were as close to this other house as we could be without going over the fence.  These hungover people were getting a rude awakening.  Plus, this was one night we had called cops.  They were going to have to deal with a complaint and their landlord when they got up.\n\nMom continued throwing trash over the fence back into their yard.  Dog bayed.  Critter didn't care; critter was safe under his cage and happily snacking on the grass.  I doubt any of the other neighbors would have cared, as we knew most of them and they had all been dealing with the same noise we had for months.  No one from the house ever came out but I know that dog made enough racket to wake them all up, hopefully feeling like crap.  That was the last rowdy party that house had until the end of the semester.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't find out about this next bit until I was well into adulthood.  Part two of this revenge includes my dad, who to his credit always tried to deal with these people civilly.  The victims of his revenge were in the house down the street.  They were so loud that half a block away we could still hear their music and yelling.  Except these people were meaner.  They got really crazy, and sometimes the parties got violent.  When my dad went to ask them to lower the noise level, they said not just nasty, but threatening things to him.  Same complaints to the cops, same b.s.\n\nAfter they kept us awake for the dozenth time, my dad went over to their absolutely trashed yard after dark.  With him, he had a crock pot of chili that had been neglected in the fridge for far too long.  My dad said it smelled and looked like vomit.  And lo, there was the motorcycle of one of the assholes, parked in the front yard, uncovered.  My dad liberated the rotten chili onto said bike.  He told me he peeked out the window a few times, and actually got to witness the glorious moment the bike owner came upon his defiled cycle.  The guy apparently actually PUT HIS HAND in this stuff and then proceeded to puke all over the lawn.  I'm sure he thought someone else had been sick on the bike.\n\nNo one ever cleaned off the bike, either.  It sat in the yard until it was nothing but rust.  I still consider my dad to be one of the most passive human beings on this earth, but it shows that everyone has their limit.\n\nFortunately, afterwards both houses had decent kids every year until we moved away from that house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

In front me sat a bitch(no better word to describe her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe would frequently take my stationary without asking like the eraser or ruler, sometimes not give it back. She would ride her chair and hit my desk and made me make mistakes on my drawing by doing so. She would contently talk to me a get me in trouble with the teacher, and just generally annoy me by existing. I never confronted her or with anyone about her micro bullying because i was generally a very shy guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day she was riding on her chair but instead of constantly hitting my table she just let it lay on my desk, her hair was all over my desk and when i tried moving it she yelled at me \"Don't touch my hair!\" i replied by asking her to please not lay on my desk, she ignored me and proceeded chatting her phone, (The teacher was not in class).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was fed up at this point\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn comes the petty revenge, I said to her once again your gonna fall if you don't stop, she laughed and said that she didn't care. I moved a bit back with my chair and proceeded to pull my desk all the way to my stomach and the chair slipped and she fell backwards unfortunately she did hit her head on my desk. The whole class burst out laughing and i said to her \"I told you that you would fall\".\n\nShe was pissed but she put her chair back up and never annoyed me again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Some details may not be as accurate as this happened around 6 years ago also also sorry for bad grammar\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was last to get on the bus so when i got on there was no open seats. But then I spotted a seat in between the middle of the bus and the back of the bus. There was a kid sitting alone and my friends behind him so lets call the kid Tim. This is how our conversation goes:\n\nMe: hey what’s up, so there is no other seats and i was wondering if i could sit down here?\n\nTim:no\n\nMe: why?\n\nTim:Because there is no room. (Keep in mind that he is a skinny kid)\n \nMe: yes there is.\n\nTim: no theres not. (Proceeds to put shoulder pads in seat next to him and put his legs up)\n\nMe: could you please move there is no room any where else.\n\nTim: no\n\nThis is when the kid in front of us pushed Tim more into his seat so i could sit down. Even after that he pushed me out of the seat even more to where 3/4 of my butt was hanging out of the seat.\n\nHeres the petty revenge: since there was a number of kids behind us when we got to the school i let every kid pass before i got out of the seat. Then I took my time walking down the isle.\nWhen we got back to the school i did the same exact thing and he was mad. He started talking a bunch of shit, calling me various names so i did the same back he got mad and i told like half of the team what happened and they were mad at him too for being a bitch. \n\nSo this is my story, hope you enjoyed.",

I texted my ex saying \"Wow why are you trying to get a gun\". He denied it at first and I said that I heard somewhere that he was. He asked me who told him, so I said \"I'm not going to snitch, how many people do you talk to about buying guns?\" He said that by saying that, I did snitch. \n\nI went back on his Instagram later and he was cussing out the gun dude, calling him a snake and fake for telling me.

At this point I've had enough. Fuck you. as I lean across the counter I hook my elbow in her purse and drag it off onto the ground as I grab my food and leave. As I left she was walking out.

By this time the cyclist is gone, but I can’t just let this guy go. He’s obviously in a hurry, and when we parked he comes flying out yelling at me that it was my fault. So I pretend to make a call to report it, and wait it out for 2-3 more minutes. Then I tell him to not be such an asshole as I left.

        "text": "To start off, I had a really long day. A VERY long day, so I already was in a mood. I parked my car on the top floor because every other spot was taken &amp; then waited for the veeerry slow elevator. As it opened, a guy practically sprinted off the elevator, and when I got in, I realized it was because he had pressed EVERY. SINGLE. FLOOR. (14).\n\nI yelled out, “fuck you, asshole” to which he yelled back, “enjoy the ride”.\n\nNope. NOPE. NOPE!!! Not today. \n\nHe got off the elevator, which means he was leaving the garage... and I had some pettiness and attitude to rub off onto someone. \n\nI get off the elevator, and stand in the middle of the garage, waiting for his car. 4 minutes go by.. I start to think maybe he was going across the garage into the other building....but then I see headlights turn the corner. IT’S HIM! \n\nI’m standing right in the middle of the garage, when he (douchebag) pulls up to me. \n\nDB: “Hey, can you move?”\n\nMe: “oh, are you trying to leave in a reasonable time?”\n\nDB: “yes, obviously. The elevator thing wasn’t a big deal, people do it all the time.”\n\nMe: “well you assumed I had all the time in the world to stop at every floor, so I’ll do the same &amp; take my time enjoying the view from up here”\n\nCommence honking, flashing high beams, and yelling. \nI just stood there. I looked at the skyline of Houston for a bit, thinking about how truly petty this was. My plan was to keep standing there until another car came by, but one came around the corner 3 minutes in. Once I explained what happened, the girl told me she had some time too! We laughed and she sat on her phone, while I stood blocking him in. This pissed him off even more. \n\n12 minutes later, another car came behind the girl, so I moved for them. Not before giving that douchebag the meanest middle finger in the world. \n\nEdit: grammar.

        "text": "LTL FTP on mobile and all that. \n\nSome context: My son attends a swimming class each week after school. My eldest is a good natured kid, but he can be loud at times - nothing unpleasant, just boistrous. This isn't normally a problem as, well, he is a child and people generally allow kids to be kids. \n\nOnto the story. Just over a week ago my mother took them to the lesson (usually my wife or I take them). This isn't really relevant apart from the timing of when i found out. More on this later.\n\nAfter the lesson, apparently my boy was singing (I think he likes the acoustics) the star wars theme tunes in the changing rooms which aparently annoyed one of the other parents (rude bitch RB from now on) so much that they felt the need to tell him off and to be quiet. My son did tell his gramdma about this afterwards, but she didn't really do anything - including telling me. Now i get he may have been loud. I get that may have distracted your child - but if you have an issue talk to the parent (or in this case grandparent). Don't have a pop at someone elses kid.\n\nFastforward a week and its time for the next lesson. This is when i found out - cue righteous anger that someone would talk to my child that way. Papa bear has been stired and no time to cool down.\n\nMy wifes likes to avoid confrontation, so she talks me down from going in charging to talking quietly with the organisers to put out a notice about not talking to others kids. I'm still fuming, but this is the plan.\n\nOn the way there my son is still talking about it so I can see its left an impression. He also points out RB on the way in. I tell him not to worry, I'll sort it.\n\nThe lesson comes and passes without incident and the kids all troop off to the changing rooms. At this point my son and I both notice RB is in the changing rooms too. I catch his eye, give a little nod and a wink. His little eyes light up and without a word he starting singing. He knows I've got his back. I don't think that RB has clocked that I'm his parent and I'm in the changing rooms with him rather than his grandmother waiting outside.\n\nHe starts at a reaonable volume, then gets a bit louder. He looks over at me, I smile, he smiles, the volume increases. The words get more random and he starts doing his impression of an opera singer. I keep looking over at RB and I'm just hoping that they will say something. \n\nAnd then gloriously my opportunity arises. RB turns round with an evil glare and says \"shoosh\". Thats enough for me. \n\n\"Excuse me. Don't talk to my child like that\". A look of shock crosses RB's face - can this be? Can someone dare to pull them up on their behaviour? Damn straight I can. \n\nRB starts to bluster about if they cant talk to him then I should - now to be clear, I run a fairly relaxed ship and whilst dangerous or otherwise unpleasant behavour will get called out instantly, I generally let him express himself freely. He wasn't doing anything dangerous, there was no bad language in his songs, the other kids in the room were having a giggle at his antics. There was no bad behaviour. If RB can't handle some loud noise, then I respectfully suggest a changing room full of 5-11 year olds is not the right place to be.\n\nI could have got into a shouting match at this point, which esentially would have been a loud discussion on parenting styles and would have got us nowhere and not been a great example for the kids. So instead I drop the bomb:\n\n\"You aren't even supposed to be in here\"\n\nYou see RB is female. In the male changing rooms. The rules on this are quite clear and posted everywhere - adults are only allowed in their own genders changing room. If your child needs help getting changed then they go to the changing roon where you are allowed and definately not the other way around. Being the polite Brits we are no one had confronted her about this before.\n\nAfter a shocked second of silence she says \"they told me my child isnt allowed in the girls changing room as he is over 8\" (complete BS by the way) to which i respond that he should be able to get changed by himself then. Honestly, if you have the gall to criticise my parenting for allowing my son to sing when yours can't even get dressed by themselves I think you need to reassess things.\n\nShe now doubles down saying that they (the staff) told her she should be there (again complete BS). At which point the other dads decide to join in and back me up saying that they were uncomfortable having her there and that the rules are clear and that their spouses have been told the same thing previously. \n\nI sit back now and let them talk to her, as it just makes it more powerful that way. They also chime in on how its inappropriate for her to tell off other peoples kids. The look on her face as she realised that no one was buying her crap and she wasnt going to win was priceless. She didn't say another word whilst finishing hustling her kids out of the room. \n\nI don't want to judge based on looks, but she looked the type that is used to getting her way and ignoring rules when they dont suit her. Can you imagine the outcry if the genders were reversed and it was a man in the girls changing room?\n\nWhen she left my kid gave me the biggest shit eating grin and high fived me. He knows his Dad has got his back. \n\nI later spoke to the swim school who confirmed the rules and that they would be putting up more signs and apologised for her behaviour (not really their fault but good customer service I guess).\n\nTL:DR rude bitch tries to discipline my child (who was doing nothing wrong other than being loud), gets put in her place and can't come back to the male changing room.

        "text": "This happened about a year ago today, I work in a call center, and occasionally we do get those calls with those absolute dickheads on the phone. Well, on this fateful day I had one of them. He was cursing and screaming because he owed us money and didn't want to pay. \n\nHe was cursing at me, shouting and screaming, calling me every name under the sun. But on this day I was up for it. I didn't respond, I was just chilling out, letting him wind himself up, trying again and again to help the lovely gentleman. Unfortunately some people have thick skulls, this man included. He started accusing me of laughing at him, now all of our calls are recorded,  and I hadn't laughed. So I denied it and told him to remain calm. Unfortunately he wasn't having any of that.\n\nLong story short, eventually he took the moral high ground, and told me to stop being ignorant and then hung up. This pissed me of. The pissed off that you just can't shake. It was nothing major, just an idiot on the phone, but it got to me. I tried to forget it but I couldn't. So I checked his account the next day. He had called up again and complained about me, they were going to listen to the call. Fair enough. I knew I had done nothing wrong so that was fine by me. HOWEVER, they had given him £10 of compensation FOR NO REASON. Simply because he called me ignorant when he complained. Now that really grinded my gears. \n\nSo I sent him a product, which will arrive to him in a few weeks, however because of the way the system works, I knew this products charge wouldn't be sent to him for about 3 months. Now, 3 months from then worked out to be bang on Christmas. So he would be sent a bill for £40 on Christmas. Obviously it would all be recorded on the system and we will be able to see it was a mistake, but at Christmas the lines are busy. And I mean busy. So fuck you random guy, have fun wasting your Christmas holiday on the phone. \n\nTL;DR: Guy got compensated for complaining about me when I did nothing wrong. Sent him a bill that he won't get until Christmas and will have to call us again to get rid of it.",

Apologies for formatting issues, on mobile. \n\nI was going 45 mph in a 35 mph zone - plenty fast enough I'd think, probably too fast, really (I do admittedly have a lead foot) - and someone wanted to ride my bumper anyways. Now if someone is going under the speed limit, particularly if it appears they're doing so unnecessarily and without any hazards on, then I understand why you'd want to ride their bumper in annoyance. But when someone is already speeding, and you ride their bumper anyway because they aren't speeding enough for your liking? Oh no. Time to feel my petty wrath. \n\nWell, I *was* speeding along happily but that's too bad because congratulations, now I'm going to go 30 mph in a 35 mph zone for you instead. \n\nOh, so you wanna give me the finger in my rearview mirror and attempt to illegally use the center (left turn only) lane to pass me now? Well then, allow me to just speed right back up so you can't do that.  \n\nOh, so now that you've accepted your loss and merged back in behind me, you need to make a right turn? Too bad I'm going straight, there isn't a dedicated right turn lane, and the light ahead is turning yellow, so I *have* to slow to a stop now, you know. Can't be running red lights, after all.\n\nWell, you're finally free of me, and you just took out your anger on your gas pedal. Oh, you didn't know that the cops regularly set up speed traps right up the road from where you turned right, and now that you've sped off angrily you have flashing lights behind you? Well, I guess you know about that speed trap now. \n\nOh goodness, those school zone lights up there in the speed trap weren't flashing, were they? Tsk tsk.

        "text": "Background Info - So about a month ago I started working night fill at my local supermarket however the week I got the job I ended up having to move to a suburb about 30 minutes drive away, which sucks because I don't have a car and because of the hours I work there are no trains that run from midnight til 5am. So I have to get my sister to pick me up and drip me off some nights or I just take her car if she isn't using it.\n\nStory - So when I first started working there I got \"trained\" by the 3ic of the night fill team. She is still on the same level as me its just that she's been there for so long that she can run the place herself, but to be clear, she is not a MANAGER, she is just a crew membee who can run shifts. So when I showed up for my first shift she pretty much gave me a very short briefing of what to do. \"Take the item off the cage, and put it on the shelf, done\" so I did that while she walked off to another aisle and started talking to another coworker and when she came back she yelled at me for not being quick enough, I told her that I was learning the aisle but she told me I should've researched the aisles. WTF.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and I'm proficient enough to not need any help the whole shift which is good so I don't need to deal with the 3ic, however, I do need her to let me out of the building because the employee door has a code for both entering and exiting and only she and other team leaders know it, this is to prevent people leaving early and what not.\nSo I'm doing my thing until I get a call around about 11ish from my sister to say that she can't pick me up from work as she is super tired and doesn't want to risk driving so far whilst sleep deprived, but I can meet her in the city, which was halfway, and she can get me from there. This means I had to catch the last available train straight after work at 12:06am. So I went straight to the 3ic and asked her if I could leave 5 minutes early because I needed to have some time to walk to the train station that was 10 minutes away. But she straight up said \"no\". \"You'll finish at 12 which is the time you're rostered on til\". Bitch. So I had to call my sister and she had to drive 30 minutes to come and pick me up and to make it worse the 3ic was talking to another coworker for another 5 minutes after I had finished so I had to wait 5 extra minutes til I got out. Me and my sister were both extremely pissed.\n\nNow for the juicy part, last night at work I got put on split duty, this pretty much means I take all the stock from these pallets we get delivered from a delivery truck and put them on to roll cages and we put them in each aisle. Each roll cage in each aisle should only have items for that aisle. Pretty standard system I think. \nAnyway, I also had to train this day cashier how to do split duty, he usually works during they day but he couldn't work so they swapped his shift for a night shift, not a big deal, plus this guy was cool. Whilst we were working the 3ic comes into the loading dock and she asks if there is any roll cages for her aisle. She has the chocolate aisle. Chocolate aisle is the worst aisle. Its so tedious because there is so many brands of chocolate not too mention the aisle also has chips, popcorn, nuts, etc. I say \"yeah, I think this is the last one\" as I give her the roll cage, which is only half stacked. She looks me dead in the eye and says \"awesome after I finish this I can relax in the office\" and walks off. Once she's out of the loading dock I then tell the other guy that all roll cages for her aisle are to be put all the way at the back so if she comes back in, she won't be able to see them.\nSo an hour goes by and its almost 4am, which is when I clock off, and she's just getting to the bottom of her roll cage, which you can tell she's happy about. \nI then tell the other guy to help me to roll all the rest of the cages to her aisle. As were rolling up to her I yell \"Aisle 4\". She turns around and all I can see is a face of pure shock from the 3ic. The guy and I wheeled in 4 roll cages absolutely packed with product. Just to put it into perspective it usually takes just under 1 hour to finish unpacking a normally filled roll cage if you're working fast. These ones were stacked to the max, some of the product was falling off, so they would take over an hour to finish by yourself. I also made it so that same items weren't paired so she would be walking up and down the aisle all night. Anyway she looks at me and says \" this is a joke, right?\" I said \"no, these are fresh off of the pallet, also can you let me out its time for me to clock off?\" and I walk off.\n\nNow because she's running the shift she can't leave until every roll cage in every aisle is unpacked, so she had to stay there until 8am. Its only 2 hours overtime, however she had been working since 10pm. Sucked in.\n\nTL;DR - 3ic lady wouldn't let me leave early on my overnight so I could catch the last train available so I make her stay back 2 extra hours at work.\n\n\nEdit: My bad, I should've elaborated more, there are emergency doors, however when they get opened they sound the alarm and I'm pretty sure it alerts emergency services. We have an employee door at the back of the store for after hours use, night fill staff use this door, however it's locked all the time and you need a code to get out.",

        "text": "Over the summer, I worked at an ice-cream shop in my college town. Our customers during the summer usually consist of families with young children and seniors. Many of these people are repeat customers, and besides the occasional angry drunk or out-of-control child, they're pleasant enough to deal with and leave decent tips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one Saturday night, this young family with three toddlers comes in and starts looking at the flavors. All the kids are immediately yelling that they want the 'Superman' ice cream. For context, Superman ice-cream is a sickeningly sweet conglomeration of pink, blue, and yellow ice-cream, (think rainbow sherbet but worse) hence it's popularity among kids. So the mom, a nicely-dressed woman in her late 20's, says to me very rudely, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Give me three kid-sized cups of Superman and MAKE SURE you try to scoop as much blue ice-cream as possible cause my kids ONLY like the BLUE flavor\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my mind, I'm like, whatever lady, I'm not going to violate the rules and take 10 minutes to scoop all of the blue ice cream out just for your bratty kids while there's a long line behind you. But I told her, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Sure, I'll try... but the blue is all swirled in with the other flavors, so you might be out of luck.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this fucking lady proceeds to point out where and how I should be scooping so I can get only the blue flavor. At this point, she turns to my coworker and asks what my name is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Drizzlepunk isn't trying hard enough to scoop only the blue ice-cream!\" she harrumphs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer husband's face is frozen in a grimace of embarrassment. THEN, she decides to demand a single-scoop container of ice-cream that is sitting in our freezer because \"nobody else is gonna buy it\". I assured her that, yes, someone always does buy it, and I am not allowed to give it to her for free. She won't take no for an answer, and starts verbally harassing my coworker at the cash register and whining to her husband about how it's not fair that we won't give her free ice-cream. At this point, I'm 100% convinced she's on drugs or something. After we finally finish scooping their complicated-as-fuck order, I figure the husband, who seemed polite and reasonable, is going to do damage control and leave us a tip for having to deal with his unhinged wife... but, nope. Not even a dime. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very next weekend, the same family comes in again. This time, however, the mom is totally polite and is acting normal as could be. Of course, her kids all want Superman ice-cream again, and I treasure the look of utter humiliation on her face as I ask her, with a knowing smile, \"Would you like me to try to scoop only the blue flavor?\". She just politely laughs in response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor whatever reason, she still decides to show her face in the store, even after making a complete fool of herself. Whenever I happen to see her family there on my shift, I always make sure to very loudly whisper to my coworkers, \"Hey, look! It's that crazy woman who demanded free ice-cream that one time!\".",

        "text": "Right as soon as we got on the plane I knew this guy was going to be trouble. Let’s call him Paul. \n\nPaul was blocking the walk way having half his body in the aisle, rearranging his backpack for whatever reason (when no one was next to him and he could’ve just done this in his seat). No big deal, I’ll just wait for him to be done. Then Paul insists on me walking around him, which with him being half in the isle makes it quite hard. My body brushes up against his body which made him mad even though he told me to go through. Of course everyone else is trying to board the plane as well and are running into the same issue and Paul is taking his sweet sweet time. Whatever. My boyfriend and I got the row right behind him and sat down awaiting the plane to take off. \n\nNext offense is when someone is trying to put their bag in the overhead bin, and Paul goes ape shit. Starts yelling at this women that there is glass in his bag and that she can’t put her luggage there. She calmly tells Paul that this space is for everyone and she needs to put her bag there as is no more room in the other compartments. Paul’s wife doesn’t think this women is getting the point so they start yelling how they’re “custom wine glasses” and that she cannot put her bags there. I was giving this women props, she stood on the seat to gently rearrange things and kept her calm the entire time despite being yelled at. Of course this was not good enough for Paul and his wife, who kept muttering under their breath about how stupid she was and that she was going to ruin their glasses. \n\nWhen we finally get in the air the baby one row behind me (two rows behind Paul) starts crying. The baby wasn’t even crying 30 seconds before Paul decides to yell “Give that kid a bottle”. The parents obviously ignore this and calm down their child within a minute or so. Now throughout the flight the baby cried a couple more times, each time lasting no longer than 3 minutes. A very good baby. Paul however was not pleased and each time the baby cried he’d turn around and give the parents the stink eye then get up and walk around. I kept hoping the baby would cry just so he’d have to listen to it. \n\nI’m a very shy person so I wasn’t about to confront him, and my boyfriend (who was in the seat behind him) had his head phones on and wasn’t aware of what was going on. So I hatch a plan for my petty revenge, to make his plane ride as unpleasant as possible. What’d I do? I clued in my boyfriend on the situation and had him join my cause. He opened and shut the tray table multiple times “for his laptop”. He sat with his knees in Paul’s seat. He kept putting his water bottle in the pocket behind the seat and taking it out. I kept “accidentally” hitting his seat when I would go to cross my legs. I turned my ac on full blast and pointed it his way. I ate my chips as loud and slow as possible. I coughed multiple times very loudly. All of this would make Paul stare at us and then complain to his wife. I hope your custom wine glasses broke asshole.",

        "text": "Alright, I’ll start with the mandatory  ”I’m on a phone”  and “English isn’t my native language so please pardon any typos” lines.  This is my first post ever so bear with me.\n\nThis story takes place around eight or nine years ago when I was in high school. I used to spend my time after school playing different games on my computer while talking to friends. Even though I mostly played some of the more popular first-person shooter games I also played some online browser games to pass time. This story will focus on one particular browser game, I doubt it is that well known, set in an ancient land. \n\nYou started out with a town on an island which you developed financially, militarily and so on. You needed to have different resources in order to upgrade your towns and it was eventually possible to build new cities on different islands.\n\nYou could also wage war with different players and plunder their cities resources.\n\nSo my buddy, lets refer to him as NM for No Manners, started to play the game with me. Since I was stronger than him I decided to help him out a lot by sending him all the resources he would need in order to advance quickly. NM would greedily accept my charity but would never show any gratitude or even give me a small “thank you”. This went on for a while. As he got stronger I would need to send more resources since his buildings got more expensive to upgrade. One day I felt like being a good buddy and I sent him a huge ship load of resources. When I logged in a while later I saw my inbox flashing with a message from NM. I opened the message and saw one word responding to my great kindness. One small word forever burnt in my mind.\n\n- “Good”.\n\nThat’s when I decided that I wanted my resources back. With interest. So I mobilized my armies, battle ships and set them to plunder NM. I got decent loot at first. But the more I plundered him the less resources I got since he didn’t have much left to give. He wrote a few messages asking me to stop. He even asked me at school. But my blood lust was insatiable and there was no stopping the death machine. After a while he texted me saying that he would quit unless I stopped attacking him. I could feel my fingers punching the keyboard typing a single worded response.\n\n- “Good”.",

        "text": "Well, in retrospect, maybe I overshot a little. \n\nI was awkward as a teenager. I hated crowds, the sound of my own voice, I did not enjoy school (which, among other factors, made me underperform) and whenever I talked to someone I tried to make it brief. \n\nOne guy, lets call him M, picked on me from day one for that. He singled me out on every opportunity he got, made fun of me, what I wore, what I read and so on. It was constant and nonstop and he ultimately got in trouble with the teachers for this. He toned it down afterwards, but his bullying never ceased completely. Until we graduated, that is, after which I did not see him again for about a year. \n\nLo and behold, class reunion comes. I was a bit more self-assured then, thanks to new friends, a therapist and other benevolent factors, so I even felt comfortable talking to M for a bit. Unsurprisingly, he was unapologetic about his bullying and said something along the lines of \"Well, you kind of deserved that, so, you know, it's all good.\" \n\nThat was the straw that broke the camels back. Bully me for three years, alright, but don't ever, EVER tell me that this is my own fault. \n\nSo I planned my revenge. I knew Ms full name, so looking him up on Facebook was easy enough. He had posted some decent photos of himself, too, which came in just handy. I am quiet adept with Photoshop, so faking a photo for job applications (yeah, it's a thing where I live) was easy enough. I also managed to put together a CV for him and find out his address. And then the fun began. \n\nIn his profile, M foolishly said what his job aspirations were. How he wanted to achieve them. And I decided to help him a little. I spend a fair bit of money and time to gather every possible job opportunity for him to achieve his aspiration in a 60-mile radius, give or take a bit. Not only Internet job offers, but advertisements in various newspapers, word of mouth and even going to the employment office to check on any offerings I might have missed. And I send all of them an application in Ms name, complete with photo, address, CV, copy of his last report card (which was also done in Photoshop, which was honestly painstaking) and everything. The letter of appliaction was, of course, written by me as well. And while it wasn't shitty in any sense, I carefully arranged it so that nobody would even invite M to a job interview. Just small mistakes here and there, nothing like \"Excessive masturbation\" in hobbies - it was just another letter someone could have actually send, it was just very, very bad. \n\nNeedless to say M moved shortly after. And I felt satisfaction. I was tempted to repeat my little trick after finding out where he lived now, but I decided against it. Even though he deserved it in my book.",

But we all know kids are greedy ASF, while the teacher has his back turned helping another student, some kid grabs a snack. Teacher tells him to put it back and the kid refuses. Now this has happened many times before so he got pretty fucking pissed. He grabs the bag of chips out of the kids hand and grabs the 2 boxes of snacks and dumps them in the trash. And goes to sit at his desk. Now keep in mind I go to school in a ghetto part of San Jose CA, so kids are stoners and don't care about education. This comes In to play in a second.\n\nNow for the petty revenge :)\n\nThe second the teacher sits down 5 or so kids grab snacks like crazy from the trash can.\n\nWhat is the teachers response?\n\nBetter learn now since your going to be doing that for the rest of your life. \n\n\nEvery\n\nKid\n\nFucking\n\nStopped\n\n\nOne of them asks what?

Things started off great, but gradually his bad habits started coming out. One of which is spoiling everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, he sees you interacting with.\n\nHe spoiled the Witcher 3 DLC that I had been avoiding spoilers of for years. Same with Dragon Age: Inquisition and it's DLC too. The worst by far was when he saw my girlfriend and I watching GLOW and stated that he hadn't started watching it yet. 3 days later, when we were nearing the season 2 finale, he spoiled it. He speed-watched it ahead of us and then spoiled it for us. \n\nSo I decided to play off something he holds near and dear; his coke. He drinks at least 5 litres a day, and loves to leave the bottles all over the kitchen floor. So now I leave all of his coke bottles as loosely closed as possible so that all his drinks go flat. \n\nI also let his cheese slices go stale too.",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, on mobile, TL;DR at the end, you get me.\n\nContext: I work in a crafts store that also has a fabric department. Customer brings up a bolt and asks for an amount, I cut it. I usually give at least an inch more than they ask for because sometimes the previous cut was diagonal or jagged or whatever. I also just like to be nice!\n\nYesterday, I hear the service bell ring and I walk over to take the order. Lo and behold, a co-worker from my department is here before her shift and wants some fabric cut.\n\nNow I don't really enjoy Co-worker because she has a very... particular way of working. She changed a lot of things around to suit her style, and it makes it near impossible for me to do my job properly sometimes, but this is the fourth person that's been in my department in the span of a few months and unfortunately, she's been the best out of all of them. I just deal with her shit when I come in and do my job as best I can.\n\nAnyway, Co-worker asks me to measure out the fabric and she says she can cut it herself. I tell her I'm more than willing to cut it, since I cut fabric for other employees all the time, no big deal! She gives me a large roll of mesh and asks if I'll cut a yard and a half for her.\n\nHere's the offense: I start measuring, taking care to go over the amount like I always do. She immediately scolds me and tells me I'm doing it wrong. She says that I shouldn't start from zero and measure a half, she says I should put the edge at the yard mark and measure backwards. I was taught differently by a different employee, but okay, I say, I'll do it this way. She keeps telling me why I'm wrong and how I could've shorted her and she's the best. I hold my tongue and cut. I don't appreciate her being so condescending towards me, but I want to be done with this interaction.\n\nShe then asks for two and a half yards of a fleece bolt \"cut the exact same way\".\n\nThe revenge? I don't give her any extra. I put the edge of the fabric just a hair over the line, and I go slower than usual to boot. No extra for you, Co-worker! That inch is reserved for a polite customer!\n\nTL;DR a co-worker of mine bitches that I don't cut fabric right so I don't give her any extra fabric and make her wait longer to get her cut.",

Arms being thrown up and the whole bit.  I didn’t react in any way, just continued with my transaction.\n\nIt really wasn’t taking long, typically deposits are one of the quickest transactions at the bank.   I know I’ve been behind people in the drive-thru seemingly doing the most complex or time consuming bank transactions, but this certainly wasn’t the case.  So the tube comes back from the teller with my receipt and I am done, but before pulling away I sent the empty tube back to the teller just so angry face would have to wait just a little bit longer.

        "text": "Just read an AITA that reminded me of this story...\n\nWhen my daughter was born my wife and I were hesitant to bombard social media with pictures of her. We were happy to share some favorite pictures with family and friends but wanted to have some control over the flow of it.\n\nMy mom and I have had a spotty past but are generally on good terms these days. She can often act like child rather than an adult. She lives on the other side of the country. I sent her some pictures and asked her not to post them to FB but could show them around or whatever. She immediately posted them to FB. I wasn’t happy and asked her to take then down. She obliged. \n\nI was slower to send pictures to her after that.  In the meantime my wife posted a picture or two on her FB. My mom took that as an opportunity to take those same pictures and post them as her own post without asking as they were already out there. Without getting in the weeds about right or wrong, it was certainly against the spirit of our request. I let her know how I felt. \n\nEnter the petty revenge. I did an image search for babies with the same attributes as my daughter, eye color, hair color, age, etc. I foubd a blog with a baby that looked similar to our daughter in one picture. I sent her the picture after cropping what I needed. Note that I never said this was my daughter. I just sent it without comment. She took the bait and immediately posted it to FB without asking.\n\nI waited about a day or so until she had racked up a good number of comments and likes and sent her the link to the blog privately. It took her a second but she got it. Ultimately she thought it was pretty funny but asked permission after that. ",

He gets to the front door at about lunch time and is greeted by a huge woman who could barely fit through her own front door. As soon as she opens the door she goes off on one shouting \"why are you knocking on my door so early, how dare you wake me up\" and just generally being a prick. He then explains he is there to fix the lift and then she then goes mental again shouting about how long he took to come and how she reported it months ago which although is understandable it's not his fault as he came when he was called. Once she had actually calmed down she explained that the lift had been   making noises and rattling so he went to check and although he explained this to me I haven't got a clue what was actually wrong with it but the gist was he replaced something and it was fixed. He then goes back to her to tell her it's fixed and show her it works and then once she had gone back in the flat he unplugged the wire for the button so she would have to walk down to the next floor to get a lift (which she was in no shape to do) and then he would get the call back fee from the council in a month's time.",

It was strangely quiet the whole way. I tried to start conversation more than once, but it went nowhere. All attempts to start conversation went single word shutdown. \n\nWe get to a steak house. Note: vegetarian. I'm not actually all that upset at steak house as most will feed me a potato and sides. It's not the best option, but I can eat.\n\nWe get seated. He has a two-for-one coupon. He presents it. He tries to order for me (meat; does not go well). He has yet to speak to me at all. It is really awkward. Dead silence nobody is talking awkward,\n\nThe server, a very nice person, offers me a plate of all the sides given I'm veggie and she's really nice. Nope. Dude demands two steaks and my steak packed in a doggie bag and I should be given the sides. I... am confused and wish I was not there, but so it goes. There continues to be dead silence. I try to start conversation more than once, but it fails with one word answers.\n\nHe tosses a fit when my plate shows up, sans meat, with every side the place has. It's a really nice plate of mac and cheese, broccoli, rice, asparagus and more. I'm told \"compliments of the chef.\" He has a shit fit that he didn't get these sides with his steak. He eventually works himself up to a storm out and leaves me an hour from my dorm with no way to get home.\n\nThe really nice people who worked there found me a ride home and in the pettiest of revenge \"never saw\" the coupon he claimed when they reported his dine and dash to the local police.

        "text": "Not sure if this is petty but, I decide to just post it here anyway.\n\nEB= Elder Brother\n\nSo, right now, I'm 21, so I can decide for myself whether I want to eat out or eat in. But this happened when I was around 18 years old, I will sometimes have instant noodles for lunch. I know this isn't a healthy option, but what are you going to do when you have to save money  instead of eating out? I almost always eat spicy stuff, so it's no stranger that I eat spicy ramen as well. This brand is called the \"Shin\" Ramen. It's really my favorite flavor of ramen. But I have to eat slowly so I don't choke myself from spiciness.\n\nThen, in comes my dad and elder brother, aka. Big Mouths. I really despise it when someone asks me to share my food, not like it'll make it different to my dad and EB. You know why I call them \"Big Mouths\"? It's because take always take a huge bite of out of any food available. In one single bite, they are able to eat at least 25% of a single food item. Add them together and you have 50% of the food gone and there's nothing I can do about it. If I deny, they'll say things like \"Stop being selfish!\", \"It's just one small bite!\" It's as if they are justified to eat my food.\n\nOnce I was eating a burger, and they took a huge bite out of it, leaving me with only half of a burger. Because of this, almost every single food I eat is always only 50%. They always slurp the noodles too, to pour salt on the wound I suppose. They do this all the time and they show NO remorse from it. This annoyed the hell out of me so much, that I decide to put my petty revenge plan into action. \n\nI remembered that I ordered takeout at a grilled chicken place by myself one time, and they provided me with some packets of hot sauce, which I still have in my room. I accumulated about 15-20 packets of that sauce, which I use to flavor some of my food sometimes. So, I asked my maid to cook me the \"Shin\" Ramen which I liked. The taste isn't so bad with the hot sauce too, I figured this would affect their ability to eat big bites. So once the ramen was served to me, I squeezed about 5-10 packets of hot sauce into the noodles when they weren't looking and mixed it together really good so it doesn't look too obvious.\n\nAfter that, once I was done, my dad and EB came to me a few minutes later and asked for a bite. They whipped out their chopsticks, I stood up from the seat to give them more space, dad proceeded to take a big, fat bite out of my noodles, then followed by my EB. They noticed the extra spiciness when they bit into in the noodles, they recoiled from the spiciness. To add icing on the cake, because they slurped the noodles so hard, they end up coughing furiously. All while their coughing, they accused me of tampering with the noodles. To which I told them I don't know what their talking about, and said the noodles are way more spicy now and dad and EB didn't know about it. They walked away, complaining about the spiciness and coughing constantly. With satisfaction in my eyes, I sat back down and enjoyed my still full bowl of noodles in peace. Now they'll probably think twice before eating most of my food and slurping really loud.\n\nTL;DR: Dad and EB always eat big bites out of my food, so I put hot sauce in my noodles and they never eat my food again.\n\nP.S I do have money to eat out, I am just trying to save my allowance given by my mom, okay? And there's so many comments about my maid, please refrain from asking any more about her. She has no relevance to the story, she just helped me cook noodles a few times, that's it. So no offense, but can you guys stop questioning the minor details? It's just a petty revenge story.\n\nP.S.S I changed the phrase \"little to no money\" to \"saving money\". Does that change anything?\n\nP.S.S.S I live in Malaysia, having maids is considered pretty normal there. I am by no means a rich person. I am a middle class.",

        "text": "I used to be a laborer at Jackson Hole and lived in the town nearby, which meant catching a 6:15 bus to my 7am job. I had two roommates, trust fund kid Roger and ex-marine Wyatt who did not need to wake up super early for work every day. Roger didn’t work and Wyatt was a bartender. \n\nOne night I had gone to sleep around 10 or 11 to wake up at 6. At 3am I hear them come home, being loud and sort of wake up halfway. Then I hear Wyatt say, “Hey, let’s fuck with Finance Guy!” Roger agreed and I prepared for whatever dumb shenanigans they were going to do. I assumed they were going to try something while I was sleeping like shaving cream or drawing on my face...I was wrong. Instead they bum rushed me while I was in bed and started wrestling with me. Roger simply grabbed my leg but Wyatt reverted to military training, shoving his forearm into my throat and pinning me down. After a few minutes of this they got up, laughing, and went to their rooms to sleep it off. I could no longer sleep, because now I was amped!\n\nNow I had 3 hours until the bus came with nothing to do. If we had the whole house to ourselves I would’ve played music but I didn’t want to piss off the folks upstairs, so I came up with more targeted antics. I went into the bathroom and cut the ends off of their toothpaste so they couldn’t use it properly, then put it back in their kits. I filled up their Tums jars with water, meaning every time they got indigestion that month they had to suck it up. I put canola oil on the ground outside of their rooms so they would slip and fall. I tied a bar across their door frames to the handles so they couldn’t get out. For Wyatt, I filled up a bucket of water and doused his car. Being midwinter, it left a 1/2 inch layer of ice on his car. I did other stuff too, but I forgot the rest.\n\nOn the bus in the morning I sent them a text: “Thanks for waking me up last night. Enjoy your ‘tainted’ toothbrushes!” (I didn’t do what it sounds like, I was just fucking with them) Afterwards, Wyatt said that I was being unreasonable. Fuck you dude, I had to work hard labor with minimal sleep!",

        "text": "My brother had surgery this summer. His wife works night shift and would have had to taken off a significant amount of work to take care of their kids so since I'm just a college student on summer break and typically love my nieces and nephew, I offered to come stay and help out. They have three children: Twin nieces are 10 and nephew is 8. \n\nMy brother had surgery in late May and I arrived to stay shortly before that. Everything was great at first. I cooked, I cleaned (I know it's strange but I like cleaning so this isn't a bad thing), watched movies with my big brother, helped him get around, baked with the kids, gossiped with SIL, it was awesome. I especially loved cooking because usually I just cook for myself and it's way more enjoyable to cook for others (at least in my opinion). \n\nThis is where things went a little south. My nephew is a douche. I don't know where the sweet little boy that I saw a few times a year and begged his mom to facetime Auntie Lily so I could read him a bedtime story went, but he sure as hell wasn't present this summer. I don't care if it's rude to call an 8 year old a dick, I call it like I see it and the kid is a dick. My brother and SIL warned me he was going to be a dick but I didn't believe them. I was wrong. Very wrong. There is no pleasing him what-so-ever. For example: \n\nTake him to a movie? Why can't we go to two? \nGo for ice cream? Why can't we order another one to take home for later? \nGo to the carnival? Why can't we drive three hours to the super awesome carnival they went to one time two years ago. \n\nEvery single thing we did, he wanted more and nothing I did was good enough. Now, I know he's a kid and some of this is to be expected but this was all the damn time. Not a single day went by that he didn't cry or whine about something I did not being good enough. My brother and SIL did their best to intervene when they saw him acting like this to me but they weren't around all the time. The last straw for me was my cooking. Not to toot my own horn or anything but I'm a bangin' cook. My nieces are some of the most picky eaters you'll ever see and even they asked for more of whatever I made. However, there was no pleasing my nephew. One day he wouldn't eat the red skin mashed potatoes I Made because they had skins in them. The next time he wouldn't eat my mashed potatoes because they DIDN'T have the red skins on them. One day he wouldn't eat the roasted chicken because the skin was on it. The next time he wouldn't eat it because it was skinless. Even kid friendly stuff was wrong. One day he wouldn't eat the pb&amp;j because the peanut butter was creamy. Next time he wouldn't eat it because it was crunchy. You get the idea. All summer the kid was a gigantic asshat. I tried not to let it bug me but it did. One night he even asked me if he could pick the menu for the next night so maybe I could actually cook something he would eat. I swallowed my urge to choke the little shit and agreed. The next night he wouldn't eat because I made him round waffles instead of square. Of course being a responsible adult, I lead by example and opted to be the bigger person. I let it roll off my back and refused to let it bother....lol just kidding I wouldn't be posting here if that were true. \n\nRight before I left last month, my brother and SIL were headed to a major family reunion for my SIL's family. A bunch of her family went in on a gigantic lake house for everyone. Each family had a set list of things they were responsible to bring for everyone to use. Stuff like salt, mayo, toilet paper, etc. My brother's family were assigned snacks and drinks for the kids. This is where my revenge idea started. \n\nThe area where they were going was a very popular tourist area. Several places offered grocery delivery. You'd order online and they'd bring it to your home. I pointed this out to my brother and told him that after driving for five hours, wouldn't it be nice to just have your portion of the groceries ready and delivered without having to stop at the store? He agreed and asked me to go ahead and put together an order for him. \n\nNow the one thing that douche nephew was consistent on was what he drank. All day, every day, he refused anything to drink other than a specific brand and flavor of juice boxes. No water, no soda, no tea, no other juice, only those specific juice boxes. My brother and SIL would buy a ridiculous amount of these juice boxes at Costco. The local grocery delivery service had these juice boxes as well but given the level of douche I Was having to deal with, I just plain \"forgot\" to order that type. Instead I ordered a shit ton of juice boxes that I knew all the other kids would like, knowing full well that SIL's no-nonsense, waste not want not mother wouldn't allow someone to run out for other juice boxes when there were already more than enough to go around. According to SIL, the tantrum was epic and her mother threatened to spank him into next Tuesday if he didn't stop. Unbeknownst to me until a few days ago, her mother also heard him bad mouthing me to his cousin's and threatened him within an inch of his life that he'd best be more respectful to me or he'd have to answer to her. The last week I spent there before heading back to school was quite pleasant. ",

I'm only two weeks in to my first semester and it has been relatively quiet at night, which I'm thankful for because I have to get up at 6:30 to catch a shuttle at 7. Last night I was awakened to the sound of drunken screaming and laughing right outside of my door at 1:30 in the morning. (It was a Thursday night). I get that they want to have fun, but couldn't they have gone to the common room and not sat on the floor in the hall between our dorms? There's a rule that after 10pm, there can't be excessive noise, and they clearly didn't give a shit that they were bothering everyone else with Friday classes. (Most girls on my floor, I see them in the bathroom every morning around 6:30, so I know they must have not been happy.) I waited patiently for them to calm down and return to their dorms, but they didn't.\n\n So I decided to calmly open the door and ask them to quiet down. I sleepily said, \"Hey guys not to kill the mood, but I have an early class tomorrow and you guys are really loud\", to which one girl replied, \"I'm locked out of my room\" Now this girl and her 3 roommates were all sitting on the floor outside, surrounded by a group of loud mouthed boys. I said \"sorry\" and returned to my bed expecting them to quiet down a bit. But they didn't. The laughing and screaming and banging continued, and I barely slept. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not one for revenge, but I had to teach them a lesson in this situation. I'm relying on scholarships and a high GPA to help me fund my education, so this couldn't keep happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got ready as quickly as possible, and at around 6:30 am, I walked out of my dorm, armed with my box of art supplies for my art classes. I walked up to the door and SLAMMED the box against their door as loud as possible and ran down the hallway. I hope their hungover asses fucking enjoyed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "So, as a bit of background, my mother is horrible. She abused and neglected me throughout my childhood. I cut off contact with her for several years, but after my son was born, I figured she deserved the chance to be a grandmother (I blame hormones for that stupidity). I called her up and offered to have someone bring my son over so she could meet him without actually being around me. Fuckwit said \"Why would I want to do that? I'm sure he's as worthless as you are.\"\n\nLike I said, she's horrible. She also has long fingernails that she simply adores.\n\nA few months later, I got a job bartending close to her house. I would bring a plastic bag with me, and before every shift I'd swing by the dog park and pick up a pile of shit. As I passed by her car, I'd smear it all over the underside of her door handle, really caking it in there (the better to lodge underneath her nails). \n\nThis went on for nearly a year, until I got a new job. I'm sure she started using the passenger door or gloves or something after the first few times, but I'm also sure that she'll never quite trust a door handle again.\n\n\nFuck you Momma! My son is amazing and you'll die alone with shitty fingernails to match your shitty soul.",

Anyway, on one paper he screwed me on my money because the assignment was 4 pages minimum and I wrote 5. He didnt think he should have to pay the extra page, as it was over the minimum. On top of that, I found out he had gotten an A- and told me it was a straight B. \n\nI was super pissed so for the next assignment I wrote a 3 page piece on how 70’s porn legend John Holmes and his giant penis was his hero, discussed Holmes’ tragic life, and then dedicated a page+ to detailing how he himself had purchased a John Holmes-endorsed penis pump and how often he futilely worked at growing his own small penis. I made no effort to make the paper sound like him and the assignment had nothing to do with the topic, I just wanted him to go along with life thinking the work was covered, and then read it when I delivered it and have to write one himself at the last minute. \n\nWelp, he never read it. Just turned it in. The following week the prof handed it back and made him read it to the class, and we never worked together on that again. \n\nFuck you, Pete. You still owe me $125.",

        "text": "This is kind of a badroommate/petty revenge story. \n\nThe characters: me, 27F. E, 28F. BF, 35M. \n\nI've been living with E for 5 months. She and I are completely different. She's careless, inconsiderate, sloppy, and just *takes*. Example: BF, who doesn't drink, brought over a 6-pack he scored from a friend that works at a brewery. I started drinking and E asked for one. Then another. Then asked for *my last beer*. I said, \"No, I'd like it for myself.\" She seriously told me that we could split it in half. BF spoke up and told her, \"Let [me] have [my] beer.\" She acted like a wounded puppy and shortly afterward gathered her things to go to bed because she couldn't drink my last beer.\n\nI caught a cold from BF and I've been laid up for the last two days. Yesterday was *the worst*. Fever, chills, aches, coughing, sneezing, sniffling. If NyQuil treats it, I had it. Boyfriend brought me over food, even though I didn't really have an appetite, and an ice cream cake because our anniversary was on Monday. As soon as he walks in the door, E demands the password to BF's HBO Go account. No greeting at all, not even to me, who hadn't been out of my room literally all day because I was so sick.\n\nShe says it's not loading, and it's asking for the password. I told her that the internet was having problems, and it had been out for a few hours. I noticed when the show I was watching stopped, and I took that opportunity to sleep. She said she'd reset the router but it still wasn't working, nothing was. HBO was asking for the password because the internet wasn't working. But E doesn't have the mental capacity to understand this apparently, because even after BF begrudgingly put the password in, it *still wasn't loading* because of the internet. \n\nFinally the internet started working again. She was able to watch her shows, and she was pacified. We were getting ready for bed, chatting, when BF said she was being a total bitch, and she got him really upset with demanding the password without even a \"hello\". It's not even her account. She didn't even say thanks after he put it in! So anyway, we went to bed. I woke up at 1AM thanks to the sickness and fever. I went to use the bathroom and she was still on the couch, in the same spot, watching TV. 2AM rolled by and she finally went to bed. Unfortunately I didn't sleep for a couple more hours (but still woke up hours before her today). She's soooo lazy. I had revenge on the mind as I finally fell back asleep.\n\nThis morning I decided to see what she would do if she had no HBO. So I signed out of the app. You can still look at the videos available, but won't be able to watch them without logging in. I don't know exactly what transpired today, because I did go in and out of sleep, but every time I've left my room, she's not in the living room watching TV. She's been mostly in her room, but I think she might honestly be cleaning right now, a week after she said she was going to! And maybe, *just maybe*, she'll do the dishes that have been sitting in the sink for 6 days! Even with me being sick, I still take the time to wash my dishes after I use them. I've got to do more of the petty revenge stuff if it results in her living like a regular fucking human.\n\nEdit: CRAP I FORGOT THE BEST PART. Even though I know E is going to ask (hopefully not demand) BF for the password again, she's not going to have access to HBO until at least Monday, because BF spends every other weekend with his daughter and doesn't come over on those weekends! Ha ha!",

        "text": "I recently had a customer come in to where I work that had been a manager of the cashiers in a garden center/landscaper/landscape design firm I worked at for 11 years. For two years I had been asked to train the cashiers because he never learned the system. He was really incompetent but definitely puffed himself up and had an ego problem. I was in my 8th and 9th year there at the time and had been promoted to the accounting office after my first year. The cash register system had changed in that time but they still asked me to train them as I had been the head cashier back in my day (basically his job years later, though he’s my parents age, he got a better title since the owner was a personal friend). \n\nI ended up getting tons of overtime, sometimes 70 hours a week, costing the company a lot. He was some kind of favorite of the owner so his incompetence was overlooked.  He spent most of his days in the air conditioned office looking at magazines. There was a lot of nepotism there as well, which explains why he kept his job. The owner knew him personally and employed many family members that were unemployable. Owner’s son got fired from Subway (a sandwich maker) and he was put on driving landscape trucks and had so many accidents the insurance company said he could no longer drive if they were to cover the company. \n\nAbout a year later, the company that had been around for 140 years went under and got bought out. This was 2009 and the recession was hitting landscape companies hard. The name continued as a landscape design firm that had about 20 employees instead of 250.  I was laid off as a part of this, as they didn’t have a need for an entire accounting office. The one person left was a relative that was let go after coming back from 3 weeks FMLA when her husband had just died.\n\nAnyway, when I had him as a customer he asked if I worked there at one time and I said yes! Remember I trained the cashiers for you? He said yes, that was a hard POS (point of sale) system to learn. I laughed and he looked at me funny. So I told him the system was new to me too when I went back to train his employees. He looked kind of embarrassed. I changed the subject and asked what he was doing now. He perks up again and tells me he still worked there! In accounting! He was beaming and I could tell that inflated his ego. So I said, oh, my old job! Though I bet it’s much more relaxing now that they don’t have all those employees and having to do job costing for all the landscaping/snow plowing jobs. Sounds like a nice gig! \n\nI just wanted to pretend we didn’t know each other, but he had to brag that he eventually got my old job with much less work to it. \n",

        "text": "Alright. This took place back a few years in ny freshman year at highschool. So, there was this one girl I liked, and I mean I liked her A LOT. A close friend of mine was also friends with her decided to start spreading the fact that I did like her. But the catch was is that he added I wanted to ask her to prom/homecoming and fuck her dry. Never really had any intentions of asking her to either in the first place. But I guess the second part was immature as hell. But to be honest, it was disturbing for most, but nothing believeable putting it in that way.\n\nAnyways, word got around fast about it, and people started questioning me about it and giving me looks in the hallway. I avoided my crush at every corner and nook, even so going as far to starve myself somewhere else during the lunch periods, or usually feeding off a banana or breakfast bar I brought from home. I finally broke and I decided I had enough.\n\nI inquired a social worker about it, but left out many of the vulgar parts. The sex, and all. I never identified my friend out of the mindset that people deserved \"second chances\". \n\nI was alright with the social worker. He told me to come back if it gets worse. And it never really did. I found out that my friend dispatched other friends to do his work as well. \n\nNow even more pissed, I decided to take action myself. I don't really know how exactly I got this idea, preferably from To Catch A Predator, but here as follows:\n\nI made an account posing as a girl on Instagram, and DM'd a few of those friends of mine in a flirty way. Sometimes even suggesting sex upfront, whilst at the same time providing some good photos to harden my cover.\n\nI asked ALL of them if we could meet at a Starbucks, and all of them but two said yes. Keep in mind there are 5 in all. I sent the three to seperate locations, well, different Starbucks around their areas, and left them hanging for a long while, say like 3 hours in hopes they would be getting some good ol buttsecks. I called them up and, being the freshman I was began screaming obscenities and heavy vulgar at them one at a time.\n\nI got a good laugh out of it and the rumors continued regardless, although it was worth it. Almost.\n\n(PS crosspost from r/ProRevenge cause I got shitted and downvoted to hell on absolutely everyone for not reading the sidebar or something, my fault but holy shit they were pissed at me)\n",

        "text": "Just a small note, this is slightly different to most of the posts here but I still think you may enjoy it.\n\nAs a bit of background, about a month ago I decided to start going to the gym before work. This meant I would be getting up about an hour earlier than normal (6am, nothing too horrible) which I was fine with; but my housemate took a bit of time to adjust. My housemate is pretty cute and she does spend a few nights in my bed which I'm not going to complain about, but it means that when my alarm goes off, it wakes her up too.\n\nFortunately over the past month she's made the adjustment and has altered her morning routine to work around mine. But this morning she took it too far.\n\nI can toss and turn a bit in my sleep, and it does wake her up, but she normally just goes straight back to sleep. This morning though I woke her up at 4am and she decided that it was time for breakfast.\n\nThis would normally be fine for any other housemate, but this one demands that I prepare her food. Look, I understand that it seems weird, but she's really cute and I'm a pushover. But not this morning, because 4am is not a time that anyone should be up, and I am not having it. \n\nI try telling her this, but there's no reasoning with this girl. It's like talking to a cat.\n\nIn fact it's exactly like that. She is a cat. And when cats want food, they will bully you until you get it. I tried holding my ground, but when she started pawing at my face I felt like the next step would have been claws, and I'm not willing to take that chance.\n\nSo despite the fact that it's 4am, I force my groggy self out of bed to feed this adorable demon her breakfast, only to discover a bowl full of dry food that she neglected overnight.\n\nNow if she wants her breakfast, that's fine, I will give it to her. But you'd better believe that I took a fraction of the amount of food she normally gets and mashed it up into the dry food, and just for good measure poured more dry food on top.\n\nIt was petty, vindictive and not going to stop her from waking me up at 4am in the future, but it felt good.",

Initially I had a DON who was the best.  She retired and was replaced by the DONfromHELL. DFH hearafter. DFH was simply a vile and hateful woman. Just the worst human I had experienced in a position of power. She was a wrinkled crone to boot, which is beside the point except to clarify that she was ugly inside and out.  The woman took great joy in making any and all in her scope as miserable as possible. Eventually I left her scope.  As is typical of the public sector she was promoted. Again I was under her scope.  As soon as she figured it out she did everything she could to make me miserable again. I left. Fast forward 20 plus years.  I am working in a small rehab facility. I recognize DFH, now retired and with broken hip requiring rehab. She is now my patient and while having this gnarled crone as DON was bad enough, having her as patient was potentially worse. I immediately made notice that I would not participate in her care and why.  Current management was understanding of my issues and agreed I would not be subjected to doing her care.  She recognized me one day while I was giving a patient medication in the common rehab gym.  She said to me, \"remember me Tessamari, I was your DFH?\"  I smiled my best smile and looked at her deeply for a minute and said, \"I am sorry, I can't seem to place you, where is it you were my DFH?\"  She puffed up and sputtered just a tad and explained our prior association. I pasted a puzzled expression on my face.  Well, yes I did work there, I recall several folks with whom I worked there and all, what a great time we had! But..but I just can't recall you.  Hmm... how odd.  I kept this charade up for the entirety of her stay there, never quite able to recall her.  This irritated the piss out of her. Absolutely pushed her to the point of apoplexy at least once.  \"I guess you have blocked it all out!\"  Well dittery-doo, don't I just feel so silly not recalling our time together.  Hmmm so odd.  Never once did I let on that I recalled her keeping a pleasantly confused look on my face until she discharged. God that was fun.   ",

It's not insanely complicated, but it's not the easiest to navigate, the signage isn't fantastic, feels like none of the directions  are correct on GPS, it was dark, and I was coming from a different direction than I usually do. So this is mostly a problem of my own making. I thought I'd finally found the right building, I pulled in, immediately could tell that this garage was only for returning Advantage and Dollar rentals. I put the car in reverse, and started backing out slowly, and an SUV turned in and came right up on my bumper. I gave him time to reverse, but he wouldn't move. I didn't care to get out and explain the situation, so I drove in, put my window down, told the gate agent I was in the wrong spot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe petty part: Juuuuuust as I decided to pull all the way in, a car came up to exit the garage, and it wasn't a fast process, they had to check license, asked for directions, asked where something was in the vehicle. I could have very easily pulled all the way in, and the guy behind me could have gotten through. Instead I sat there, waiting for the exiting vehicle to be completely gone, before I pulled in/around to exit. And even then, I arched to the right and made a wide turn, so he had to wait for me to fully exit the garage. (the guy didn't beep, I think it was one of those unfortunate 'we made this situation happen together, we'll both just wait it out' but the grump in me was very satisfied to make that guy sit there as long as I had to sit there.
