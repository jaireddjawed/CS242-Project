        "text": "Hey guys! I was diagnosed with ADHD about a decade ago, but haven't really learned much about it aside from reading a book that I currently am forgetting the name of. I had a question about the phenomenon known as 'Hyperfocusing'; which I think I experience while on my phone. I'll be playing a game or building something but I'll get distracted by trying to socialize or message people on my phone to the point where I'm sitting there for 15-20 minutes at a time just switching between apps waiting for someone to reply, and I won't be able to really break the focus on that. Is this considered hyperfocus? I apologize in advance if this has been discussed or is in a megathread already.",

So this is my personal tip for you guys to avoid ADHD Tax from your unwanted Subscriptions! My tip is to use Virtual Cards because you can easily block them and replace a new one INSTANTLY! So Only use your Virtual Card for Paying Subscriptions online and NEVER use your Physical one. So you have your virtual card now and your next step is to have a regular schedule of blocking your Virtual Card (It will generate new Card info so you will not be charged) once a week. After blocking your card, get a new one and have the peace of mind that you will not be charged unexpectedly. If you are scared because you will forget to regularly block your card once a week, you can set an alarm or anything that reminds you to Block your Card.  Also, I remind all of you that we have different Bank and card provider so call your Card Provider if they have this feature because my Card Provider named \"Paymaya\" offer this feature.

I hated every single minute of it. I was just a body completely zoned out devoid of all emotion and personality. When I would come home from school I would sit on the couch and basically disassociate for hours. I couldn't nap because I couldn't sleep. It was horrible \n\nTo add to that, of course my grades were declining because I couldn't do anything because I was so zombied. My teachers even said that. So what did my parents do? Yell and scream at me because it's my fault, beat me because I was failing, never listen to me when I raised concerns because \"the doctors know best\" \"you don't know what your talking about\" \"your just not trying\" completely ignoring cries for help. My dad would always say \"the doctors say you have ADHD but only a little bit of it, you just arent applying yourself\"  mom would say \"it's because of those damn games you play all the time! No more games, no more outside time, you will only sit at the kitchen table and do school work until its all done\" completely sucking away any escape I had\n\nTraumatizing. \n\nNow I'm in my mid 20s and I have absolutely no tools or skills to fix the problems I have. I've learned nothing about myself or how I operate, I constantly remember the past whenever I try to think of how to handle problems and struggles in my daily life. Once I hit 18 I immediately ceased my Concerta and it's only recently that I started back on it at 27mg, but with no resources It's not benefiting me at all I feel. It's gotten so overwhelming that the only coping mechanism I have is alcohol. That's the only thing I learned from my mother was how to get shitfaced.\n\nMy issues are threatening my career and I'm terrified to lose what I have but I don't know where to start. I do have a therapist but I'm not entirely sure they are very well versed in ADHD patients and I don't know how to pick the right one because I don't even understand it myself\n\nPlease help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I know this is a lot off my chest, if you are concerned about my safety, I understand, no, I'm not a danger to myself or to other people,  I never will be)",

All sounds good.\n\nHowever, now that I’ve been thinking about it a bit, I don’t really want to switch off Adderall. I have very few side effects and when I actually eat right with high protein, it works really well for my focus. I don’t even get a decreased appetite really. I feel like I made a mistake switching meds when hopefully the Adderall shortage will be solved when generic vyvanse gets approved in a few months. \n\nI even told my doctor I would like to switch to either vyvanse or Adderall once the shortage ends, which they were fine with. Also, the only reason I had issues with the shortage is I had to use a pharmacy that wouldn’t accept my insurance so I had to pay $50 for my meds, which I can afford. \n\nOverall, I feel like I made a bad choice switching off a medication that was working and helping me make progress to one that might not work as well because I was just tired of dealing with the shortage issue, but still managing to get my medication on time. \n\nSorry for the rambling, but I just want to get some advice from people who might be in a similar situation. So what are your thoughts, should I ask my doctor to switch back and deal with the shortage or just try concerta?",

We both discussed and agreed medication would be the best route for me.\n\nI want to know how the appointment works. Do i get a diagnosis there? Am i going to take a test? Im unsure of how it works but ive had adhd almost my entire life and my mom has been aware (She was a child psychologist before switching her specialisation)  but thought i was doing fine untreated. I want to ask to be put on SNRI specifically strattera and not stimulants. Primarily because my mom is a addiction specialist and is scared ill abuse it and itll be a gateway drug which i understand because i acknowledge i have a addictive personality and i dont want that to happen to me. \n\nIf you take strattera please answer this. I know the medicine takes time to start working but i know it also suppresses appetite, i want to meal plan so i eat when im put on whatever medicine but i wanna know, was the appetite suppression instant and continuous even after the medicine started working or did it stop and happen again when you upped your dose?",

As I'm still in school and therefore need to focus on occasion, i take medication to help with that, and while I'm not sure how it exactly works it basically makes me generally calmer and means i can focus more. The thing is that whenever I forget to take them and just goofing off and being myself I get asked \"did you take your meds today?'',  implying that when I think I'm just being myself, they just see it as another day i forgot to take my medicine. I think the thing is that ever since being diagnosed everyone around me has stopped veiwing me being my normal self as just who i am, and instead a day where ive forgotten to take my meds. And so this begs the question is hyperactivness or whatever \"side effect\" there may be a part of my personality or just an effect of the adhd, meaning that if i didnt have adhd at all would i have a completely different personality? \n\nI know its a bit of a silly thing to think about really and that many people (myself included) struggle with identity issues in general, its just something that always felt a bit invalidating to me when im just going throughout my life and the way i act is seen as an \"issue\" that needs to be fixed by the tablets. But i dunno - maybe their right, if i didnt have adhd at all i have no idea what type of person i would be, its just a part of who i am i guess.\n\nI dont really know what the point of this post was, i was just wondering if anyone felt the same of had any thoughts about this.",

It “has” effects, (not negative) but I can’t describe them. They may be subtle? Can’t “accuse” it that it’s worsening my ADHD. But when I feel I’m overstimulated, it “might” be. Can’t identify or describe the positives either.\n\nI have this tendency to not go ahead and do what I’m supposed to do, while I still think about it in my mind and know that I should do it, but physically I’m doing something else entirely, (for example: laying down, using my phone, reading about other things, sitting/standing/hanging in one place (without moving or going about my affairs after I’m done with whatever I was doing), poor time management, poor organisation and prioritisation of tasks. The day mostly finishes before I’m able to do what I planned. Maybe I should gather all of my symptoms that are assumably ADHD and put them in one post for reference.\n\nOn a different (unrelated) note, I’m considering to discuss with the doc to add an antidepressant. My non-ADHD symptoms include mild anxiety, mild depression, and a mild manifestation of PTSD (emotional distress and recurring panic attacks). \n\nI would like to know your experiences, choice ADHD stimulants (beside Vyvanse as not available here) and antidepressants plus their dosages.",

So if he asks for a sex act that I'm not feeling in the moment, I might stay silent or gently redirect to a different activity. He is persistent, often asking multiple times in a short span of time, and occasionally physically putting himself in place to just make the act happen. No specific act, this has happened with different things.\n\nHe tells me this is his (diagnosed) ADHD making him not pay attention to me and only pay attention to his goal: whatever sexual act. Is this an issue others face? Is there anything I can do to help the situation?\n\nThanks everyone!",

It's all I ever want to do lately, and I'm not upset about that at all.\n\nBut yesterday morning around 3:30am, I just had this huge wave of sadness, and almost grief. I was sobbing almost uncontrollably. I began thinking about the real world and how awful and corrupt it is, how everyone is so controlled by media, money, drugs, crime, etc. and it just made me yearn to be in that fictional world even more. I long to be in a world where the purpose of life isn't just working a 9-5 and eventually having kids and paying a mortgage and going to bars and partying and shopping and doing all these mediocre things just to pass the time. Even modern design and cities and the lack of nature and wonder in the world makes me feel so empty. \n\nI thought about how I wish I could go on these adventures in real life, and having friends who have these personalities and morals that I have yet to see in anyone I've met in real life. I feel like when I'm not playing this game, I haven't much going on (or anything nearly as exciting or fun, anyway). Even when I do hang out with people, it just isn't as fulfilling as \"hanging out\" in this fictional world. I just wish I could have this real, long-lasting feeling of excitement and adventure, but this modern day Americanized way of life has become so draining and lifeless. \n\nAnd it's not to say I don't find any enjoyment or appreciate anything, I actually really find joy in so many things. I always try to keep that childlike sense of wonder and admiration for the sweet little things, and I'm not trying to be ungrateful at all. I feel so lucky to be alive and experience life, it's just that I wish the world was quite a bit different. I wish everything was so much more full of life. I wish I knew others who felt the same.\n\nHas anyone else here experienced this?",

ADHD was long suspected in my life as early as age 6, however my parents never addressed it for whatever reasons. Being medicated has completely changed my life for the better and I never realised how bad my decision dysfunction was until I was on medicaion. My moods are better, I'm can focus at work, I can get up at 6:00am in the morning and go to the gym, I am even hearing what my girlfriend says when she talks to me haha.\n\nHowever, where I still fail is moderation. \n\nI have always been someone who is always interested in lots of new things, and will generally seek out fun and interesting hobbies. I now notice that I am on Ritalin, my fixation on things is way stronger. Which is like, great in a work setting or just needing to look after myself. For example, I don't like to use the term \"Hyperfixation\" as it gets used very loosely, however when I spend 5 hours jigsaw puzzle, on several occasions I would dare say its an accurate description. I will do something until it is completed, or until the thing is no longer bringing me joy and if anything, is having the opposite effect on my mood. Gaming did this to me prior to medication, which is something I am very aware of and my gaming addiction is since in the past. I notice when I drink (and in my past of illicit substance use) I would always go absolutely overboard. All my friends have always said \"You will do something until you absolutely hate it.\" \n\nIt seems my entire personality is to go over board on things I like doing, and now I have the ability to focus even HARDER on more things. I have gone from struggling to make decisions for myself to now having my entire weeks planned in advance and I do not stop moving from 6AM in the morning until 6PM in the afternoon. I am quite literally disecting every nook and cranny of my life to see where I can repair the last 28 years worth of disorder. I can feel the burn out coming, but I simply don't know what is relaxing anymore, or what is me just being lazy when I could be productive.\n\nHas anyone else had this complete 360 turn on their life once being medicated?? And how did you learn to relax again afterwards.",

I was finally able to see a psychologist in January and got diagnosed with ADHD-PI (as well as AvPD, PTSD and BED + being monitored further for BP-II). I was prescribed Concerta and it did not go well. It made me very anxious, jittery and a bit dizzy so I stopped after about five days. This was super disappointing since it did help me focus which felt AMAZING. I’ve never felt that way before and I wanted so badly to keep that feeling, but the anxiety was unbearable. It’s been about a month and I feel like I’m ready to try another medication. Is it worth trying a different stimulant medication or will it likely have the same negative effects for me?  Has anyone here had any luck with non-stimulant ADHD medication? Anything I should be cautious of given my current medication and diagnoses? Any insight would be great, thanks in advance.",

At the end of the summer I was sad to see her go, and missed her a lot for about a month, but was able to move on after that.\n\nHowever, we then worked together again this past summer and the crush took on a whole new form. She added me on Snapchat and we would constantly snap back and forth, and I learned she also had ADHD which meant we could talk about the most random things and act like it’s totally normal. We would have really deep conversations and I truly felt like in a way she was a girl version of me. I would spend all of my down time (meaning when I’m not on stand) talking to her, and it made the time go by in a flash. She told me a similar thing. She was a lot better from the previous summer, but she still talked bad about everyone else to me, and I learned from others she would brag about how many dudes she had sex with (while never mentioning any of that to me, and actually telling me how she was upset that some of the other guy lifeguards were bragging to her about their body count). \n\nSo clearly she is not a good person and I know that. I keep trying to tell myself it won’t work. I know it won’t work even if I ended up getting with her. But for the past 7 months(!!!) she is literally alllll I think about. For the first few months after summer when we left I would constantly try to talk to her and get her attention, but she would only reply to me sparingly and it made my anxiety shoot through the roof (which to be fair looking back I was being pretty needy). I decided to just stop talking to her which I have actually succeeded at, but she’s still all I think about. Seriously, from the moment I wake up to when I go to sleep she’s in my head and it drives me to tears constantly. I’ve been going to the gym and have actually really built up my self esteem which I’m happy about, but the fact I still can’t get this girl out of my head just makes me break down constantly. I KNOW she’s a bad person, and I KNOW if I ever got with her it would almost certainly end in heartbreak. She’s also the type to constantly crave attention from guys and post heavily filtered photos, so I know she’s got insecurity issues and would be terrible to be with. Yet she is still all I think about and I miss her so, so much.\n\nI’ve read that ADHD people are able to get over these things quickly but obviously for me this isn’t the case. Even when I hang out with the few friends I have I still think of her and want her to know everything I’m doing (which again I’ve been able to cut contact with her but still).\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? This is destroying what little sanity I have left",

        "text": "Unpopular opinion, but I don’t think new diagnosis should be prescribed adderall until the shortage is over. If there’s already a deficit then it will create a bigger one with new prescriptions being added. This is a strong drug that has horrible withdrawal effects and all it is going to do is create more hysteria of getting people used to it then when the next month comes some unlucky patients not getting their meds. I don’t think anyone should have to struggle however once you have it and it’s taken away there is a new level of struggle that makes life impossible. I’ve seen a woman get arrested at an Albertsons from screaming “Fucking Adderall!” and crying. Anything that has such drastic positive effects will have intense horrible effects when the body is no longer receiving it. I think it’s cruel to get people on it with the knowledge that their is a shortage and no ETA on when it will end. We are playing into the stigma that we’ve fought with this medication by calling pharmacies asking if they have it in stock and switching medicines hoping they illicit a similar response. As happy as I am to hear about a people’s success and first days I fear others are going to be writhing in bed waiting for their fill next month.",

I genuinely can’t remember things others do in the same way. This is mostly obvious with my boyfriend. He can remember in detail so many emotional and meaningful moments, but I can only recall general memories, or very scattered specific moments. I have to be told in detail in order to understand what he means. \n\nNot only that, but I can also barely remember names unless I see someone often, and even then it can take me days more than what my friends consider “normal”. This even extends to places names. \n\nIt sucks having a great time with someone and not remembering their name at all. It sucks getting invited by people who’s name I don’t recognize but apparently according to other people I’ve spoken a lot to? (Has happened already like 4 times already these last couple of years).\n\nIt’s also awful when my boyfriend says he’s taking me somewhere I’m supposed to know and I can only remember it after I see it. I hate it when he mentions a memory and I have to ask him a million times to specify more cuz my dumbass brain isn’t remembering a thing. It sucks that I can enjoy listening to him talk about something he enjoys but I can only remember the stupidest details and not the info that will actually be mentioned again. \n\nThis makes me feel awful, like some asshole who cant be bothered to even remember the easiest things. But I just can’t and I don’t want to use my adhd as an excuse or a crutch.",
