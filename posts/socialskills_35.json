I wasnt bothered by it at first and i would tell her to take as much time as she needs to reply to my messages but now she just leaves me on delivered for like a day and eventually she opens it without replying. I stopped reaching out to her.\nWe used to share all sorts of secrets with each other and now i dont have anyone else to do that with.\n\nThe one thing that really hurt me was seeing her and another girl in our friend group getting close with each other. They have code names for other people, they go out together and have inside jokes. Just recently i saw that she posted a story of them two having a good time.\n\nNow i just feel stupid for letting this get to me. Im just a terrible friend that sucks energy out of people.",

Yesterday I seen him make a post on Facebook saying \"Don't start that til Thursday shit this week\" He's obviously talking about me and I would've been understanding if he just told me directly. I thought it was kinda weak for somebody who's supposed to be \"street\" to act so passive aggressive. Should I say something or just ignore it?",

        "text": "I (21F) met this guy (23M) a month ago at a work event in my state. He lives in another state a 12 hour drive away. We hit it off but I’m the one who asked him to ‘keep in contact’ - he immediately got my number, called it to confirm it was right, gave me a hug and all that. He texted me afterwards to check I got home safely. So despite me being the one to initiate the number exchange, I think that was a good sign he was interested at first?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe texted almost everyday for awhile and it was flirtatious too. The problem was I found out that we had quite different values so I mentioned that were weren’t ‘on the same page’. We didn’t speak for almost a week afterwards until I reached out asking for genuine advice on a work matter. He replied saying he was thinking of me and he was super helpful and supportive but as soon as the conversation wasn’t work related, he was really dry and short. So I told him that I don’t think our values are all that different because I’d thought about it more. He agreed and was happy that we were ‘on the same page’ again. We then continued to talk for another week or so, with talks of travelling to meet up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually we both start the conversation and perhaps he asks more questions to keep it going although he can be dry too.. and I may just not reply, especially if it’s late and I fall asleep. (I’m realising this may be my downfall lol). Last we spoke a few days ago, i said goodnight around 9pm because i was so tired and he replied saying goodnight. But now it’s been a few days and neither of us have reached out. I feel like he may have lost interest because of what happened when it seemed that our values didn’t align.. Today’s Valentine’s Day so maybe it’s a bit awkward for that too and he feels pressure to mention it if he reaches out? Should I reach out? Just mutual fade? I’d be upset still if we didn’t continue talking but don’t want to come across too strong either. We also work for the same company so I wanna be mindful of that",

        "text": "I started a new job just over a year ago, my first new role since lockdown and WFH was a thing. I've found it really hard to fit in because when there are work catch-ups it's generally people catching up with each other because they no longer see each other everyday. Over time it's been a bit easier to join, especially with after work socials.\n\nThe real problem has been over the past year, 10 people have left my department and I feel like none had any interest in getting to know me as they were already on their way out and didn't want to waste time investing getting to know someone they wouldn't see again. So I got the cold shoulder a lot of the time. Since these people have left whenever there's things like after work drinks, someone always suggested inviting these ex-colleagues which just leaves me feeling unwelcome at my own work social.\n\nRecently I overheard them talking about having catch-up drinks with these former colleagues who I worked with briefly that I wouldn't expect be invited to - I do the same with colleagues from my old job I was close with - but it is awkward when we have unofficial work socials (like drinks after work), which I see as opportunities to get to know my colleagues and build relationships, but they want to invite old colleagues who have no interest in involving me in any conversations. I feel like I'm at a reunion where I don't know anyone.",

Now I kinda need those images and I don't know if I should remind him again since I only asked it as a favor and wasn't going to pay him or anything.

One issue, the people here seem to be so shallow. Is this all cities??\n\nI met a girl that seemed nice &amp; we’ve become friends. But recently she has been acting shady in public situations. Essentially not considering my feelings, I’ll spare the details. I think it has a lot to do with us going out &amp; drinking. Just feel like groups that form around partying, they tend to be shallow connections because what you have in common is getting hammered. \n\nI’d rather spend my time with friends camping around a campfire (we can drink then lol), making hiking a priority, kayaking, road tripping. Like the friends I had in college. Nature &amp; adventure.\n\nI feel that in these groups, where there are macho men &amp; douche bag guys with no self awareness &amp; still in the college mindset, I am always the one that’s picked on. I’m not sure if it’s because people can tell, once they get to know me, that I am an emotional person &amp; my values reflect standing up for what’s right. They’re very conservative &amp; I get shit on because, it’s almost like they smell my people pleasing tendencies. Then love to take advantage, especially when they learn they can get a reaction I.e. me being an emotional person. It’s like they’re making fun of me behind my back because I’m sensitive. I want to remove myself from the situation. Don’t really know much others in the city…hate making friends through social media…\n\nHowever I’m an adult now &amp; not a desperate teenager. I won’t stay where I’m not valued. It just hurts. &amp; it takes me a couple tries still to pull away. Because I want that social atmosphere, I want to enjoy the bar scene here, but these situations just never make me feel good. I feel like my home town taught me the lesson of, don’t stay where people do not respect you, don’t care for your well being. However, why am I always in these dynamics? Stumble upon these people that use my vulnerabilities to subtly bully me, make demeaning comments, never take me as seriously as everyone else in the group? What can I do differently? \n\nI just never quite fit in..",

I don’t feel like wishing him, so is it ok not to wish this guy in the group chat? Or will I be considered rude or unsocial by other group members? In fact, I don’t feel connected to any of them any more (except may be couple of them). Should I exit the group or remain there as mostly a silent member?",

        "text": "After u graduate, u don't exactly talk to ppl like u did in highschool, esp when u commute. It's basically just class &amp; then home. I have like 3 high school friends on social media but I don't really talk to 2 of them. I mainly just see what they post. After high school, I've only met up with 1 of them but she's not a nice person - says some pretty messed up stuff to me sometimes - (funny &amp; relatable tho &amp; I don't have anyone else) so I really want to meet ppl who are nice. I could talk to my other high school friends but I want to meet ppl who are like me. Ppl who don't have ppl they hang out with regularly. \n\n\nI met a girl early on in a semester where I had my first in-person class but after class, I kept staying behind to ask questions. She eventually stopped asking me what I was doing after class &amp; now she has a bunch of friends in class while I have no one. And it honestly sucks sitting next to her friends &amp; her. When I talk to them, it's honestly awkward. They all just look at me &amp; she doesn't try to involve me in the convo. I don't get how she makes so many friends &amp; so fast. Some random girl came in our yearlong class this semester &amp; they're best friends now who hang out after class &amp; everything. Like how?!? This girl wasn't there last semester! I've been here since the beginning &amp; this girl barely talks to me now. \n\n\nI've gone to clubs &amp; events on campus but ppl tend to bring their friend/s to them &amp; only talk to them. So it's not easy to make friends. Even if ppl are alone, they'll just go on their phone &amp; not talk to other ppl. \n\n\nI feel like trying to make friends is hopeless. But it's SO important. I'm scared for my future. Other ppl are out making memories, really living life, &amp; living with their friends. There are just a lot more things u can do when u have friends as opposed to being alone, esp when ur female. And my parents aren't gonna let me go to far places on my own. They also keep talking about how I'm a loner &amp; need to make connections. They have no idea how hard it is, esp when most ppl in this generation think they're so cool &amp; only want to be friends with \"baddies,\" ppl who have lots of friends, &amp; ppl who hang out with guys &amp; girls. I feel like I'm gonna be living at home forever. No way can I get a place on my own in this economy. And I don't exactly feel safe doing that. \n\n\nHow on earth do u make friends &amp; why is it so difficult? I know ppl say to go somewhere regularly &amp; you'll keep seeing the same ppl but seeing isn't the same as talking. I have NO IDEA what to talk about &amp; that's what makes me lose my mind. Like I really want to talk but I never know what to say. I could ask the easy questions like \"What's your program?\" \"How many classes do u have?\" But those questions don't go anywhere. Same thing with the gym. I heard ppl make friends there. I've gone there for a year &amp; never have really talked to anyone. I wish there were classes on how to communicate cuz I honestly don't know how to talk to ppl anymore. \n\n\nAnother problem I have, how do u make ppl interested in u? I think that's why ppl don't talk to me. They're just not interested in me. How do I make ppl want to talk to me? Make eye contact with everyone &amp; smile? What about what I wear? Do I have to have a certain image? Do I have to talk a lot in class (like participate a lot)? \n\n\nAlso, how do shy ppl get outgoing ppl to adopt them? Like I heard that for a shy person to get friends, they need the help of someone who's outgoing. But from what I've seen, outgoing ppl hang out with other outgoing ppl. Why would they hang out with a shy person? I'm not a shy person tho, just have social anxiety - which I don't think outgoing ppl have.\n\n\nIt really sucks to not have friends since it's so valued in this world. I've been on my own for so long that I feel comfortable with it &amp; I enjoy it. But I don't like how other ppl talk abt me (esp my parents), how ppl look at me when I'm alone in public, or how I feel when ppl look at me when I'm alone in public. Even just walking in mall by yourself is somehow weird bc everyone my age is with a group of friends or atleast 1 other person. Like can we normalize doing stuff on your own? Somehow I can't even eat by myself. My parents think I should only get takeout with a friend, not by myself. Food like subway can be messy. I'd rather not eat it in front of someone while talking to them. And why can't I enjoy food by myself. Honestly, I'm pretty fine not having friends but it's society that makes me want to have some.\n\n\nAny thoughts, advice/suggestions?",

I've taken an unconventional route in life but I managed to become pretty entrepreneurial from a young age and make a decent income with my online business. \n\nHowever, as I said, I can be a bit introverted so I decided to pick up a part-time job for some supplementary income and to get me out socializing. So I got a part-time job at a local supermarket (which has been going well). \n\nI've been working here a little under a year now. But today I had a brief conversation with their Dairy department manager in the tea room and we were having a friendly but brief chat. \n\nHe asked me a bit about myself and everything seemed to be going well... Until he asked me my age. So I told him I'm 30 (and he didn't believe me). Which isn't unusual since most people seem to think I look 18. \n\nBut suddenly his opinion shifted of me. He told me he had just assumed I was like 22 or something (I asked him his age). And he told me he was 30 (so the same as me). \n\nAnd then he asked me when I was going to get my life together.\n\nI was kind of taken aback and a bit disappointed to be honest... because as far as I'm concerned I'm pretty successful (I just don't see the point in bragging to people about my business and side ventures). \n\nWas it wrong of him to assume, or should I have not kept details about myself from him?...",

But, I have started skipping my one class because I genuinely do not see the point, I do not talk to anyone and am complete and utterly miserable. In previous semesters I have had way more in-person courses, but I have failed to meet anyone. I genuinely no longer know what to do. I tried attending a club and because they were all friends no one acknowledged my existence. The only friends I have live 1400 miles away so we can only talk via Discord. I don't want to be alone anymore. Thankfully, I am very mentally well, but this just sucks. I am willing to do whatever is suggested so suggest away, thank you.",

Non-sexual physical affection does so much more than it’s given for.

        "text": "\nI find no point in putting my friends down, laughing at them or making them look foolish. The way I see it, we already get enough of this from our arsehole coworkers, bosses, enemies etc. Our circle of friends is supposed to be our safe haven from this and not a place to get a massive second helping of it. I never understood the point of this. When I was in high school I did out of pure necessity to fit in and not be that loner guy walking by himself who would get bullied more but I hated every minute of it. I hated how you go into group of guys and it almost feels like you already have to prepare a joke or comeback as everyone is going to start making fun of each other.\n\nFast forward to adulthood and I'm kind of a loner cause I absolutely hate this dynamic in most male circles. It bothers me when I feel I'm finally getting close to another male friend they start ragging on me as if now they feel close enough to start with this crap. Due to this I can talk to other guys but have a hard time really getting \"close\".\n\nI think it bothers me even more, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I hate it when a group of guys will make fun of me real bad and then when I tell them it's really bothering me they will say they feel bad, apologize, and try to \"make it up\". Before ya make a quick judgment let me explain exactly how this makes me feel. Why would someone call another person fat, stupid, ugly, worthless etc for months and months and then suddenly do a 180 and rave about how great that person is? If you actually thought I was a such great friend why didn't you say that from the beginning?!?! it comes across as extremely fake and disingenuous. Like they're trying to say \"you're so sensitive we have to tell you how great you are 24/7\" and comes it across as so patronizing.\n\nI'm aware this may just be due to my own trauma cause I told my group of friends they were crossing a line and then they apologized and complimented me for forever but it all just shattered when I caught them laughing and talking the same crap behind my back. So it feels once a person even starts with this, I treat them like rotten fruit and cut them off. However, it feels like I'm cutting off almost the majority of the male population. I wish this would wouldn't be the case.\n\nThe way to explain this to someone who is ok with it or a neurotypical is like this: Imagine if you were to go into some planet where there were humans here like us. However, everyone there would greet each other with a firm and hard slap to the face. That would be their way of showing affection. That's how I feel. It just makes no sense and find no fun in it.\n\nMy best friend that I have now doesn't do that and that's why he's my best friend. We don't need to insult each other 24/7. We just show up, do something, talk current events, talk work or finances, etc. It's not that hard and there's plenty of fun things you can do without being arseholes. However, it still feels like I'm extremely limiting my opportunities to have more friends. Can anyone relate to this or offer some thoughts or insight?",

I was super taken aback because I didn’t feel like there was anything weird with what my co worker said, it’s true they were waiting for me. I feel offended by really having the point driven home that the other coworker wanted me to know he wasn’t. What would you take from this situation?",

My friends know that I'm single so they found someone for me in their circle of friends. Like I said, I never flirted with anyone before and don't really know what to do or how to react with this kind of social setting. Like it's not very natural for me to meet a new person knowing that we were introduced in a romantical way. I had the opportunity to briefly meet her( we weren't alone, there were my friends and hers) and she was quite friendly. She for exemple said to me \"so you are my Valentine?“ ( it was the first time she saw me after my friends told her about me) \"what are we doing on Valentine's day?\". Maybe I'm just over analyzing or misunderstanding. The thing is I think I still want to know more about her even in a friendly way but I'm still bothered by the fact that we were introduced like in a romantical way and not just as friends of friend. Like I want to see her again and talk with her but not just the two of us. I want there to be my friends and hers like a normal social setting. My friends think I should add her on Instagram but even if I add her idk what to say and not being weird\n\nPs sorry if it's not very clear\nPPS idk if it's the right subreddit. If not what would be the right one?",

Their has been one man that had to serve 40 hours by volunteering his time. He is 27 and I am 21. I think we both bonded over drinking alcohol because I have never been a social person. Not that I can’t be social, but most of the time I tend to remain one-worded or very quiet. As a matter of fact every time I open my mouth to anybody I think that in my own mind I sound like a complete asshole. The most we ever talked about was drugs and alcohol some video games but that’s about it.  This guy invites me over to his house and comes from a completely different background from me. Think of your average white guy and that’s me, but him, he sells drugs, has prison friends and has a kid. He leads a lot wilder life than I do. I went over to his house once already and it struck me as kind’ve a trap house. He throws parties every week and invites all of his work buddies. He works at a liquor store. Now obviously if their were a mischievous reason as to why he wanted to hang with me. Then he won’t tell it to me straight. I just want to know if he is trying to actually get to know me? Or is he trying to sell me drugs? I mean he makes an effort at texting and talking. I just feel like I am missing a red-flag lol.",

        "text": "Personally, what I'm about to share was a bit like unlocking a door and walking into a beautiful garden. It's not the be-all-end-all step that'll get you more friends, but it's a start, and I feel it's a really good start, at least it was for me.  I went from crying in my bed about how lonely I was to being surrounded by people I love and trust and who care about me. But it isn't about me, it isn't about you, **it's about who you can be for the world.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This will allow you to get more real friends than you can count on your fingers.** You'll need to change your mindset from the ground up if you ever wish to be the center of attention for any group. Doesn’t matter if you’ve been socially hurt by people in the past, your new life starts today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLove everyone and you will find having interesting conversations easier. **Care for others with a genuine heart**, and you’ll become more aware of their holes (bothers) and diamonds (interests). You’ll approach them from the position of, “How can I make this person feel good with my words? How can I add value to this person’s life?” against, “How can I get them to love talking to me? How can I impress them? Come on, talk to me!”. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho do you think is more likely to have a fun and successful conversation? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA hungry salesman sells you a product. A loving mom sells you the same product. At a glance, who are you repelled by? Who are you drawn to? Are you a hungry salesman or a loving mom? Take your pick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFocus on their interests. Focus on their problems. Focus on giving. Focus on solving. Forget about invites. Forget about rewards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChase the butterflies and they’ll fly away, mend the garden and they’ll come to stay. **Change your focus. Make them feel good with your words. Expect nothing in return.** Even if nothing happens, you’ll still have a beautiful garden.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearn to care for and help others. **For every thought and action directed at someone, consider it from their view**. Just like all your thoughts and actions make perfect sense to you, be understanding of others' thoughts and actions. **Everyone wants and understands happiness in different ways**. Not only will this change the way you look at the world, but also the way the world looks at you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Including yourself**. Just as you love others, love yourself. Just as you forgive others, forgive yourself. Your mind may play tricks on you and tell you you’re not good. Regardless of what you think, you are loved and important to so many people, and you bring joy to this world in ways no one else can. Sometimes it just takes a little talking to yourself (out loud) to let it remember how amazing you are. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you find loving who you are difficult, see your mind as two. One who has negative thoughts about yourself and the other who will comfort and solve these negative thoughts when they arrive. Let your other be a hero to you when these moments come. When you accept who you are, you'll be more open and willing to share your holes and diamonds. This will make starting interesting conversations about yourself easier to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou've done so much before, you can do this and so much more.",

It just feels fake and disingenuous when I try to act kind towards people, and I sort of feel disgusted with myself after saying this, but it's not really who I am, and I am only putting up a fake image of myself when doing this with people. \n\non a side note, I also suspect a hint of neuro-divergence? But I haven't really gotten the results for the autism screening I took yet, and I will be screening for ADHD beginning in March. But a lot of the characteristics I exhibit sound like they very much are results of Autism and ADHD, which if they are, well then at least I'm glad that I would potentially be able to remedy some of this with ADHD medication.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Always assured me she wasn't going to bully me like my last job did (they were the reason I was suicidal), and that if I ever needed anything she'd be there for me, like, literally anything. I tried to reciprocate it as best as I could, if I ever grabbed anything from the store or something I offered to get her something. Made sure to listen when she talked about whatever was going on in her personal life with me, since she always offered to do the same for me. Even though we did all of that, she never really wanted to hang outside of work, although she has no problem with hanging out with other friends and our coworkers. It always rubbed me the wrong way, and I can't tell if I'm just being neurotic about it, but it felt like the bond I had with her wasn't being reciprocated, like this person became one of my best friends to me, yet I was probably at most an acquaintance. Sometimes we text each other, but it's once in a blue moon and it's only in a groupchat I'm in and she rarely participates at all. I haven't actually reached out to her in 6 months because I'm afraid of bothering her if she doesn't like me, which is something I've always been afraid of since she is kind of introverted and standoff-ish, but I want to know how she and our other coworkers are doing, my old job was kind of like a family and everyone was supposed to have each other's backs and stuff\n\nBtw I know my other coworkers lied to me about being there for me because they all promised to call me and keep in touch and when I'd reach out they'd block me or tell me to go away, but they never went above and beyond like my friend did either, it was mostly just saying they'd keep up in passing and stuff. I'm just scared she is the same way, and just more tact and nice about everything because she knows I'm still struggling. I get that what I'm doing through puts a lot of pressure on others, they're afraid of hurting me because they think they're gonna push me to the edge or some stupid shit, but leading me on when you don't mean it hurts a lot more than honesty.\n\nI just want to keep in touch with her and thank her for everything without coming off as weird. I'm not used to people being genuine around me, most of my friends and I never really open up to each other, and all we do is joke with each other, so I'm not used to being serious or sincere with someone like this. I know if she doesn't really care she'll tell me if I text her, but God am I scared to find out the truth :(",

For those unfamiliar, an NPC (non playable character) is a character which in videogames usually gives you missions or items after the playable character tells them a certain line of text.\n\nSo I'm basically doing this in real life to everyone who isn't a friend or a family member. I'm not being genuinely myself, I just give them the sequence of words which I know/think will make them perform like I need/want. I need to order a beer? I go with the same exact phrase for the millionth time and I don't stumble like when I'm very anxious and talking genuinely with my friends. Same when I work, go to the grocery store or everything that involves random people. \n\nIt's weird but it helps me. I struggle socially with people I'm not familiar with (thanks also to you anxiety), so this makes me reduce the chance of panicking and/or saying weird shit.\n\nAnyone feels like this?",

I really focused on looking him in the eye and it lit up his face, he said ‘thanks’ and we continued whilst having a natter.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nBefore I would ‘see’ an opportunity to be kind but recently, by looking more intentionally, I’ve been having a much more positive effect on my surroundings.

She also liked three other guys at the same time too. Now a week ago she got into a relationship with a 18 year old. They dated immediately after meeting (under ten hours). She’s 13. I reported this to my counselor and J got mad. J started to be dry and talk less to me after that. Just now I unfriended her on social media and she confronted me about it, I told her that there was no point since we don’t talk and that I felt weird /different talking to her.

As I am not doing it anymore, it doesn't hit the same anymore. People keep more to themselves and are less motivated, often ending in early nights instead of going to the clubs after the pregaming. And it's not, cause I don't want to. I try to keep the mood up and have fun without alcohol. Nothing new to me, being the sober one as my high tolerance hasn't often left me to be drunk before. How can I get the motivation and the vibe back to the old vines, without me being forced to drink to do that? Is there something I can do ? Any advice would be great!",

I didn't attend high school and only attended half of middle school, so I'm definitely behind when it comes to social skills. I was always on the awkward side and had incredibly bad habits, partially due to ADHD. I am now not annoying to interact with but I just feel like I'm too nice now, to the point of being boring and uninteresting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main issues are not being funny and not being a good story teller/explainer. I don't really know how to be funny honestly, and whenever I try to be funny, it just ends up being cringeworthy. Being cringeworthy feels like the only trope I know how to pull off due to be being an ex-christian with a sheltered homeschooled background and all, but while it can get laughs sometimes, it doesn't feel like they genuinely find it funny. The other thing is that I really struggle with getting to the point, partially due to anxiety. I feel like anything that comes out of my mouth will seem uninteresting to others but I know it's not the content itself but how I express it. I also have a stuttering problem along with having a quiet voice so it's difficult for sure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's really frustrating because most people who I would consider to be a friend can definitely tell that I'm trying really hard. They will tell me to not try so hard but I don't know what else to do. Simply relaxing just leads to me being quiet without contributing much. I try so so hard every day to get better at this. I read books, I force myself to talk to people on the bus, elevator, class, etc., I listen to podcasts, it's like I try way harder than my friends but still fall behind. Not that I envy them but it just feels like there is is invisible barrier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice?",

We just continued and then went back to work. I feel super awkward but also pretty shitty that they would talk behind my back like that, especially since I thought we were all friends. It feels very clique-ish but I'm also aware I'm probably over reacting. I get being annoyed with your coworkers sometimes but knowing that they're talking about me behind my back together makes it feel like we were never friends and never will be, that they have their clique and I'm the outcast.
