        "text": "[This takes place after the events of this story right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/46tlwz/the_dragonslayers_or_how_to_make_your_party_rich/)\n\nSo I was absolutely loaded, and promptly invested my hard earned cash right back into the local economy, becoming a powerful local investor. I purchased a small cart and several horses, and refused most of the party access (LE; I have to do something in character other than gyp people). \n\nWe had recently left the starting town on a quest to investigate a strange star that had fallen from the sky. I quickly make it far ahead of my party because I'm on a horse and they aren't. The DM then turns to me with a shiteating grin on his face. \n\n&gt;DM: You hear the sound of clopping hooves rapidly approaching.\n\n&gt;Z: I stop and listen closely to the ground, attempting to make out the number of people.\n\n&gt;I roll a 7\n\n&gt;DM: From what you can tell, it's definitely more than four. \n\n&gt;Z: I get back on my horse and bolt to the nearest town. \n\nSoon, however, my horse tires, and I'm overtaken by several rough-looking men in piecemeal armor.\n\n&gt;Man 1: Are you Zordon Zamzay? \n\nI desperately try to load the blame on the paladin. \n\n&gt;Z: Uh, no, sir. You must have the wrong man. Was he by chance a tall, lean human? Holy sigils, the works? Some kind of priest? \n\nI'm told to roll for bluff\n\n&gt;3\n\nOk, maybe I used all my luck before.\n\n&gt;Man 2: We know who you are! Where's the gold?! The noble Bathelor told us you had quite the debt to settle. \n\n&gt;Z: Come on now, fellas. There must be some way we can work this out together that benefits the both of us? \n\nI'm told to roll for persuasion. \n\n&gt;1\n\nThe luck well appears to have run dry, folks. \n\n&gt;DM: They all draw their swords angrily, preparing themselves for combat. Roll for initiative. \n\n&gt;Z: Ok, ok! You got me! The gold's in town, in my safe-house.\n\nI'm told to roll for persuasion. \n\n&gt;17\n\nMaybe someone's spit in the well or something. We're back in business baby! \n\n&gt;DM: They roughly bind your wrists and load you on the horse.\n\nWell, the recession hits hard. \n\nSo on the way back, we happen to run into the party. I toss them a glare and the paladin rolls a quick detect motive on the way back. While the rogue pointed me out to the rest of the party, the paladin quickly nipped that one in the bud. No big loss in his eyes I suppose. We end up in the town hall, temporarily converted to courtroom. I'm broke without the ability to cast any spells, and will likely be executed for my crimes. It was OK though. The lawful evil bastard that was my character had a plan. Meanwhile, the rest of the party was off fighting wounded aliens on a ship that crash-landed.\n\n&gt;DM: The judge slams his gavel on the bench, silencing the room. He begins to ramble in ancient historical legalese, and you can barely decipher half of what he's saying. You do know, however, that capital punishment is definitely on the table. \n\nI'm starting to get the sense that my character and his shenanigans are not wanted at this rather crowded table. \n\n&gt;Judge: What is your defence, Zordon Zamzay; thief, con artist and fraud? \n\n&gt;Z: I have no idea what you're talking about. That was genuine dragon blood! Reforged properly, it would have been nearly a hundred times sharper! That would have cleanly pierced steel! What did you do to those swords, Bathelor? \n\n&gt;NB: I reforged them like I would any other sword. I've done this thousands of times! That was plain corrupted steel refuse!\n\nAnd this is the part where I almost got kicked out by the DM. \n\n&gt;Z: You reforged them like any other blade? You fool, you cretin, you imbecile! Dragon blood is a fragile magic! Did you prepare the lamb's blood bath? The ent-charcoal forge?\n\n&gt;NB: Why is this relevant? \n\n&gt;Z: Not even the rabbit-fur polishing cloth? \n\n&gt;NB and the DM, now visibly flustered: How does this matter? At all? \n\n&gt;Z: Dragon's blood will not take on steel without the most strenuous and cautious preparation. \n\nI ask the DM if I can roll for bluff. \n\n&gt;DM: I mean - I guess so...\n\n&gt;19 + 5\n\nThe DM just holds his head and looks at me with wide eyes, while making some kind of angered squeak like he was a leaky balloon filled with salt. \n\n&gt;Judge: Did you make the proper preparations, Bathelor? \n\n&gt;NB: N-no... I suppose not. \n\n&gt;Z: Do you plan to stamp on my pride as an adventurer and detain me, then insult my pride and honor? I demand compensation! 500 gold, or charges will be pressed. \n\nDM tells me to roll for intimidation. \n\n&gt;18 + 3\n\nThe party then returns, dragging with them the corpses of several alien creatures into the town to alert the town guard to this new threat. I couldn't tell if they were happy, surprised, or irritated to find me haggling with the owner of a local whorehouse to see if I could drop 750 gold into the place to make a return of 10% of his yearly profits for 3 years, reduced to 5% for the remaining 7. \n\n________________\n\nThis campaign eventually lead to Zordon Zamzay nearly conquering the world with almost nothing but the spell Open/Close and Summon Familiar. I can do that later if anyone's interested.",

        "text": "Edit: SPOILERS FOR WE BE GOBLINS PATHFINDER CAMPAIGN CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISK. \n\n\nI'm sure we've all had friends, who don't play DnD or Pathfinder, who have asked us who's winning the game. This question has always been a conundrum for me since no one really \"wins\" at Pathfinder or DnD, you play because it's fun and let the story unfold, developing your character along the way. \n\nWell, yesterday I witnessed something unexpected. My group picked up the We Be Goblins module for pathfinder. A module, for those unaware, that lets the players play as goblins, the lowliest of races. However, on this special day, I witnessed a goblin win at pathfinder. Let me tell you how. \n\nThe story unfolds as a group of five goblins are summoned to their chieftain’s throne room, a boast most goblins of the Licktoad tribe would be unable to match. The Goblin Chieftain orders the group to go collect a large shipment of fireworks from a cargo ship that was washed ashore in a swamp. The goblins are eager to prove their might and accept this wonderful of tasks, being advised to murder any longshanks (humans), dogs and horses on the way. \n\nThe Goblin group adventures their way into the swamp, murdering a deadly many legs eats goblin babies (giant spider) along the way and eventually arrives at the ship. Unbenounced to the goblins, the ship is inhabited by a crazed goblin witch, a known cannibal, who ate her last chieftain. She brings the wrath of nature to her aid, summoning dogs, bat swarms, and large scary creatures like horses and giant toads to defend her home from the goblin adventurers seeking her death (and stash of boomsticks for their chieftain)\n\nThe battle was a struggle, one goblin lying unconscious after a fight with the dogs, and three others facing a losing battle against the crafty, goblin witch, leaving only one less-than hardy adventurer to defeat the magic user and claim her treasures. However, the tides didn't appear to be in the adventurers favor. \n\nEnter the goblin hero, Thorax, he knew he would need to outsmart the crafty witch, preferably with her own magics. Whilest his companions distracted the witch; he snuck into her treasure room and found her horde of fireworks. He grabbed one bundle and ran outside, knowing if he hit the deadly witch with its blast she would be blown into many many pieces.\n\nAndddd he was right. He exited the treasure room to see two more of his friends, lying unconscious at her feet. with one a mere ten paces away, so he lit his bundle of seven boomsticks, and used his ally’s shoulder to aim the missiles directly at the witch (and indirectly his companions). She exploded into many goblin pieces, as did the two unconscious allies, andddd remember that one that helped him aim the boomsticks? Yeap, him too, as he learned that ten paces is small compared to the blast. \n\nThe mighty goblin hero knew he had saved the day, the evil witch was dead, and now he could return what was left of the fireworks to his chieftain (admittedly not many). He searches the treasure room thoroughly this time, and finds some minor magic wonders, like a potion. He hopes it will wake up his last remaining goblin Ally. He brings the potion to his lips to encourage his unconscious friend to drink, but sees no change and too burdened by all the treasure, decides it best to kill him in cold blood. \n\nThorax returns to his home, expecting to be welcomed as a hero, only to find out his entire tribe was murdered by humans. However, he walks away with a powerful stride, there are plenty of other goblin tribes to become a part of, he can tell his story to prove his might and, who knows, maybe one day Thorax himself will become Goblin Chieftain \n\n",

Kimaris is safe and sound. Actually, probably better off than before! While we rested, we spotted two figures walking up stream. Bordel called out to them, demanding that they stop. One did, the other pressed forward, a large sack for their small size dragging behind them. As my boss continued to constrain the one folk, I once more focused my musical energies to see if I could sense the motives of the two. No sooner had I plucked the chords on my lyre did I get flooded with a familiar voice. \n\nFrom where he stood, Kimaris’s voice rang with the pain I had once heard. Somehow there was an added layer to his agony and not caring about the other folk, ran toward him. As I approached the mass of sinew and muscle, I could see his form was... decomposing? The layer of flesh was sagging and seeming to steam. Kimaris’s cries were growing louder. I asked him what was wrong, what could I do to help. He may have terrified me, but no one deserves to suffer.\n\n*Get! It! Off!* came a great cry from him that had me tremble. Fern too reiterated my question as she caught up. I wasn’t sure what he meant by ‘get it off,’ but soon I knew as Kimaris began to pull at the sagging muscle. It was so unexpected that I stood in shock as he pulled from him his own flesh. He reached up and pulled his jaw off too! In a strange frenzy he kept tearing at his body and pulling away the material that made him who he was, the entire time his voice continuing to rage louder and louder “GET IT OFF!!!”\n\nMy heart thumped loudly in my ears as I reached forward and grabbed a handful of hot, fleshy sinew and gave a pull. Steam erupted from the portion I had torn and my stomach lurched, barely managing to keep it’s own composure. It was probably the most horrid thing I had ever experienced, but it lasted no more than five minutes.\n\nFern and I stood back and beheld a peculiar sight. What once was a mass of muscle now was a young boy- well, man. He looked to be about my age, maybe younger, it's always hard to tell with Elves. His hair was long and black and draped about his fair face. The deep brown eyes Pierced mine as he regained his breath.\n\n“Kimaris?” I questioned. He nodded, confirming it was him. I still had the robes he had tossed when we first entered the factory and quickly I passed them to him so he could cover up. We then rejoined the group, were introduced to the bounty hunter, Sugalite, and informed the two of our decision to rest (considering all that we had underwent). \n\nOh! Apparently the Gnome is related to Gizmo! Sugalite is her daughter. Fancy that we happened to run into them. Hopefully we’ll be able to reunite the two together.",

        "text": "This is different than my usual fare, so I will do my best to tell the story of how I betrayed both of my friends to snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nOver spring break last year, I was in Michigan, while my friends were in Oregon. Every night, I'd stay up till 3 or 4 in the morning playing games with them. This night was no different, we started a civ game and didn't stop until it was done. We all chose random civs, I got Germany, good (at civ) friend got America and (really bad at civ) friend selected Rome. The AIs were India, England and Greece. Early on, I was losing. I chose to be an autocratic asshole who killed everybody. So I wiped out Ghandi quickly and subjugated his people. England fell quickly after that, as I was militarily dominant and scientifically dominant. Following my destruction of my enemies, I controlled half the map, and the tiny Romans were still just figuring out that musketmen aren't modern. My American friend hadn't even fought a war yet, so all he was doing was spamming wonders and science, racing for the rocket ship. After he sniped multiple wonders from me, I was about ready to punish him. However, he had passed me up in science and was on modern infantry to my great war. He was mass producing an army, but not attacking. So I sat back. I let things happen. Rome finally wiped out Greece, ending their hundred+ turn war. America started spreading across the other areas, becoming the other power, crushing Rome's expansion (not that he could tell). I focused all my tech on nukes.\n\nNow, we were all using steam voice chat to communicate, so we were constantly talking about what we were going to do. I didn't tell them I was building nukes. I didn't do anything to tip them off. Instead, I used the in game private chat to communicate with Rome privately, and after a short period of time, convinced him to attack America with me. The other big thing, which I neglected when I was planning my treachery, was that they were in the same room. Whenever I sent him a message, and he started typing, America heard and knew. He started getting paranoid. He started asking tons of questions. We gave him vague responses. He grew even more paranoid. He built a giant army. \n\nI hit 8 nukes. I decided it was time. Rebasing some nukes to nuclear destroyers, and some others to the border with my \"ally\" I prepared the final assault. I donated three nukes to Rome, and built three more with my freed up Uranium. I positioned those in my nearest city to Rome, and waited. \n\nThe moment of truth came, I nuked America. I nuked his army, I nuked Washington, Philidelphia, Chicago and more. Then, as he raged and raged. I nuked Rome. I nuked them into the ground. I pounded everything out of them. Then I moved in. They surrendered before I mopped them up.\n\nThey now don't allow nukes when we play.",

And once more, they don't care. \n\nToday I write to tell you of our most recent session, where once again strange and funny things happened. Today, I will focus on our (literally) gender fluid rogue. \n\nThrough a series of events that can only be described as slogging battles, the heroes make it to a long winding hallway. At the end of this hallway, there is a large room. The rogue makes a single trap check, and they back away: the entire room is full of traps. As the rogue enters the room, music starts up in the background playing a strange dinky tune (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM). THE ROOM IS A TRAP TETRIS GAME! While the rogue races to remove the traps, the rest of the party is exploring a small side corridor. After a short pause, one member discovers a secret door and summons the now Tetris-addicted rogue to check it out. \n\nThe secret room is a T block shaped, and very tall. It is full of spider webs, dark, damp and apparently empty. Having seen Lord of The Rings, and the Hobbit movies, the party is not fooled and immediately decide to burn the entire fucking room down. In the ultimate form of spider fear, they have the wizard cast a circular wall of fire and slam the door shut. Just before the door is shut, the rogue produces a metal bowl and popcorn and leaves it inside the oven that once was a room. \n\n15 minutes later, they open the door. Before anyone else acts the rogue shouts: \"I GRAB MY POPCORN!\" Little did he know that there was no popcorn in his bowl. Instead, a desiccated head rests where his fluffy white goodness should have been. Without missing a beat, he exclaims: \"What kind of Popcorn is this!?\"\n\nAs an aside, there weren't any spiders in the room, they were all dead and gone. There webs and victims remained though. The party spent a whole hour trying to revive one of the victims as well. Idiots...",

        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of 'What we are in the Shadows Part 3 (The Gallifreyan Problem)' which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/44qfih/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_3_the/. Diving right back in where we left off, the group had been informed of their first mission. Ghost, their erstwhile mentor and savior, told them that the \"team\" would be warning Doctor Samantha Hirsch about her impending doom. This bore varying reactions from the assorted individuals.\n\n\"Fucking what?\" Hautangi was a bastion and intelligence in this trying time. \n\n\"Wait, someone's trying to kill her?\" Ben was barely better, parroting what Ghost had just told them.\n\n\"Why does someone want Hirsch dead?\" Leilani was suspicious of both the circumstances and of Ghost.\n\n\"Who's after her, when is it happening, what do we know about Doctor Hirsch and her assailants?\" After spending weeks being helpless, Nellie was eager to seize the opportunity when it presented itself. As it turned out, planning an illicit criminal operation was very similar to organizing a corporate event. It was a a matter of asking the right questions and talking to the right people. Ghost tipped his hat to the ladies, ignoring the stupidity of Hautangi and Poindexter.\n\n\"Points to the girls for asking the right questions. First off, Hirsch pissed off someone with a lot of money and very few scruples. For the lady with all the questions: Independent group, two days and everything we have is in these files.\" He gestured at the still-running trideo-projector. Nellie immediately began scrolling through each folder, committing every word and image to memory. Leilani frowned and leaned back in her chair, glaring at Ghost. The mercenary smiled back, enigmatically. \n\n\"Why the hell would you send us to warn her? You said it yourself, we're public enemy number one. Anyone who saw us would know us in a heart-beat.\" Hautangi applauded with a cry of triumph, glad to not have to do anything dangerous. Poindexter smiled weakly, just glad to have some booze in him. Ghost chuckled, putting his feet on the table.\n\n\"Good point. Problem is, our shared employer wants you to get this done so I guess you're going to have figure it out. I'll help you plan it out if you want and I'll get whatever you need but you're flying solo here.\" Nellie turned away from her research, staring at Ghost in disbelief. Poindexter cradled his head in his hands while Hautangi laughed until he realized that it wasn't a joke. Leilani just growled, a surge of anger rippling through her slender frame. She lunged forward, slamming her hands against the tabletop. \n\n\"Then how the fuck are meant to pull this off?! According to you, we can't even go outside without Chrissy shoved up our asses!\" Ben was shaken from his self-pity by the commenting, bursting into inappropriate giggling. Ghost smirked, sipping from his beer. \n\n\"You'll have Chrissy for the return trip but you'll only have about three hours to pull it off. Anymore than that and Chrissy can't shield you anymore. Try to warn Doctor Hirsch before the day and they'll move on her. Believe me when I say that you don't want that.\" Leilani continued fuming as Nellie compiled a list.\n\n\"We'll need some clothes and make-up for disguises, fake SINs so we can get into Auckland, a vehicle for Poindexter and something to defend ourselves with if the kill-crew decides we're a threat. Are we just warning her or do we need to extract her?\" Everyone turned to Nellie, some of them confused and others impressed. \n\n\"You watched a lot of Karl Kombat Mage as a kid, didn't you?\" Hautangi jeered at the event planner, amusement thick in his voice. Ignoring him entirely, Nellie turned to Ghost and smiled.\n\n\"Have you ever seen what happens to someone who fucks up an event for Renraku? It's not pretty. This is just another party to plan, with different parameters. Give me a little time and I'll get it set up.\" A hint of her typical confidence slipped through: She sat up straighter, her chin held high. Ghost whistled, impressed. \n\n\"Not bad. Looks like you've got this handled. So, what's your plan?\" \n\nCut forward two days, to the outskirts of Auckland. A white van sits idly at the curb, darkened windows obscuring the identity of it's driver. The vehicle is facing towards a building, a medical practice if one was pedantic about such things. It was early morning and the sun was only beginning to awaken, rays of light gently rising across the idyllic landscape. A car pulled into the private parking lot, reversing into a spot reserved for 'Doctor Samantha Hirsch'. Exiting the vehicle was a handsome human woman, soft blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail, with a harried expression on her face. Muttering under her breath, Doctor Hirsch quickly made her way to the front door and readied her access card. \n\n\"Alright, she's there. Don't fuck it up.\" Several buildings away, a darkly clad figure loomed halfway out of an alleyway. With his face obscured by a ski-mask, Hautangi glanced around nervously. As tough as he was, even the big Maori had no desire to tangle with a wet-work team. He was on over-watch for now, keeping a line on the doctor while watching Leilani approach. Hautangi's back-up plan, in case of an emergency, was the same as his extraction plan: Leg it for the van and hope no-one pumped his tattooed ass full of copper-jacketed lead rounds. No-one had bothered to point out that, if the assassination team showed up to eliminate the doctor, he would not be a target.\n\n\"Got it. Engine's warm.\" Nestled inside the relative anonymity of the van, Poindexter clenched the wheel with the grip of a man rife with anxiety. He was sweating in his seat, despite the wonder of air conditioning, and his skin was shiny with the excretion. Ben wore the hood up on his sweatshirt, hoping to add another level of security to his identity. He was unnerved by the soft clicking of metal behind him, his glance drawn to the other passengers of his van. Chrissy was concentrating in one of the seats, her eyes clenched tightly. Leilani was disassembling and reassembling a sporting rifle at a steady pace, her brow furrowed in concentration. A pair of dark glasses and a trucker cap sat nestled beneath her hood, obscuring her features entirely. \n\n\"We're good here. Do it fast, don't get dead.\" Her comment was directed at the last member of their team. Nellie was walking towards the building at an easy pace, determined not to allow her building fear to show through. The only member of the team not dressed like a bad B-list crime movie ganger, the event planner had used her skills with make-up to disguise her facial features. A nice, if bland, outfit and a charming smile completed the picture of a sub-urban housewife out for a walk. A pair of running shoes served two-fold purpose: It helped to further her facade and it meant that she could get the hell out of there should the situation go south quickly.\n\n\"Then we're on. Get the show on the road.\" Nellie quickened her stride until she was within several meters of the good doctor. This was the part of the plan that they expected trouble in. If the assassination team was keeping tabs on Hirsch then they might react poorly to someone thwarting their diabolical plan. If that happened, then Poindexter would gun it over to the medical center, they would scoop up the endangered pair and Leilani would try to eliminate any threats that presented themselves. This was not the ideal situation, as one might expect, so the rest of Nellie's team watched on with bated breath. \n\nIt went without a hitch. Nellie delivered her warning, the doctor accepted it and circumspectly made her exit. The former Renraku executive made her way back to the van, reaching it at the same time as Hautangi. The two of them quickly got inside, strapped in and insisted that they depart with some haste. Poindexter pulled away from the curb at a slow, almost languid speed before leaving Auckland along a highway. It took them some time to reach their farmstead, barely arriving within the allotted time frame. The barn doors were open, allowing the van to slip easily inside their home and come to a stop. Ghost was nestled in the couch, waiting for the team with a six pack of beer and another slip of paper.\n\n\"Nicely done. It wasn't a difficult one but you pulled it off without any hitches, so congratulations. Reward for a job well done.\" Ghost set the six pack down but he had barely finished speaking when Hautangi and Poindexter appeared by his side. They started dividing up the beer between them as the girls left the van. Leilani shook her head in disgust at the sight while Nellie grinned with a nervous energy. With the team gathered around, Ghost allowed himself a small smile. \"You guys think of anything else you want, add it to the list.\" The mercenary rose from his place, walking past the gang and helping Chrissy into the van. \"I'll be back later. You kids have fun.\" \n\nOnce the van reversed away and the doors were shut, the team exchanged hysterically pleased looks. After recovering from a bout of laughter and sharing a triumphant beer, everyone dispersed. The next few weeks was filled with renewed training, scribbled additions to the list and a generally friendly air. Hautangi was happy to show Poindexter and Nellie how to throw punch while the event planner taught the others the wonders of cosmetic disguises. Leilani furthered her medical knowledge with several first aid programs, even teaching the others basic trauma procedure, while Poindexter...actually, Poindexter had very few skills other than driving or bullshitting. Regardless, the team had grown closer. Almost a month had passed when Ghost returned. He slipped the list inside his coat pocket before sitting down. \n\n\"Alright kids, you've got a new job.\" They gathered around the table, now their 'officially designated meeting spot'. There were eager smiles from Nellie and Hautangi, the duo having unearthed a surprising passion for the adrenaline-fueled work. Leilani was more guarded but interested in what Ghost had to say. Poindexter was especially glad for the precious alcohol that their dubiously-titled-mentor always brought with him. Nellie spoke up first, actually glad to see Ghost.\n\n\"So, what's it going to be this time? Break into some wealthy businessman's estate and rob him blind?\" Though she said it with a joking tone, Leilani shot her a disapproving look. The veterinarian's ire grew moments later when Hautangi piped up.\n\n\"You want us to guard the body of a smoking hot trideo-star? Cause I am UP for that!\" He exchanged high fives with Poindexter, the taxi driver raising his free hand to do so. The other was wrapped around the chilly bottle, pouring it freely into his mouth. Once he was done chugging the beer down, Poindexter put forward his own suggestion.\n\n\"Raiding a distillery somewhere? I mean, I'm just saying...\" Hautangi and Nellie both exploded into laughter, cackling madly at the idea. Even Leilani cracked a smile at Ben's proposed scheme. Ghost watched on with a tiny, sadistic smirk on his face. He waited until the antics had reached their swell before speaking. \n\n\"You're going to sabotage a heavily guarded power-plant that's crucial to the operation of several high profile facilities.\" Hautangi continued to laugh even as the others quietened, staring at Ghost with growing horror. Once he realised that the room was silent save for him, the con-man looked at the rest of his team. Seeing the petrified looks on the faces of his friends, Hautangi turned to Ghost with a quizzical expression.\n\n\"Wait. Fucking what?!\"\n\nEdit: If it's not too much trouble, would anyone who didn't like the story please leave a quick comment stating why? I'm trying to improve my writing and  I appreciate criticism! Thanks everyone.",

        "text": "I have been playing Warhammer 40k for a while now, and though playing with the guys at the store is fun and challenging, I'm trying to get my friends into it. It is hard, most of the times. They find it interesting, and have fun when I let them play with my armies, but the price of the miniatures and books is too high. This doesn't stop me from trying.\n\nSo, last night. My friend F, who doesn't know I play and honestly we may see each other less than once a month, says he wants to get into it. This is odd, as he didn't appear to be the kind of guy who likes wargaming, but what the hell, he wants to play. I ask him if he knows about the price and he says yes: he has some spare cash he's been saving for a while. Fantastic! I break out my armies so we can play a small match and let him figure out if he likes it.\n\nI decide to explain the basics using two units: a Terminator Space Marine squad and a squad of guardsmen. For those of you who don't know what they are, Terminators are heavy infantry, almost as hard to kill as some light tanks, and packing a hell of a punch; while the guardsmen are a small infantry unit with cardboard armor and weapons slightly better than laser pointers. He takes the Termies, I get the guards.\n\nAlso, you should know that I have the worst. Rolls. Ever. I play armies with lots of models because I only get hits rolling tons of dice. Like, 30 dice will get me 10 hits, and maybe five of those will hurt something. Pathetic.\n\nSo, we roll to see who goes first. I roll a six. That's never happened to me before. I've won the initiative sometimes, but with a six? Nope. So, I move my guards, and since we are playing on an empty table, I shoot. They are within range for my guns, and I get two shots. 20 dice being rolled, I need a four or more to hit them. Easy enough. I get sixteen hits. That's never happened before, either. Okay, I'll botch them next I guess.\n\n\nI roll to wound. Of the sixteen dice, ten hit. Since the weapon my guys have is shit, and the other guys are pretty tough, I needed a result of four or more to hit. Damn. I'm rolling lucky today. F is looking at me and doesn't seem to be very excited.\n\nNow, it is time for him to roll his save. Since this guys wear a fucking tank it is almost impossible that I hit that many shots, right? They need a result of two or more to pass the save. He rolls\n\nHe rolls **ten fucking ones**. No kidding. My jaw dropped. His jaw dropped. Six wounds. Five models. His entire unit, obliterated. That is almost impossible. It's like taking down a Humvee with nerf darts. Blowing up a tank with slingshots.\n\nF was not amused by the result. He was, however, amused by my reaction.\n\nWe are going to hit the store on Wednesday. He will play Imperial guards. I'm proud.",

        "text": "SO last time I posted, in the comments I said THIS\n\n&gt;Trust me, if things go the way I expect, I am never going to run out of stories.\n\nWELP, that was a lie. Not long after I became unable to play the game and it eventually stopped happening so..yeah. I've been left without tabletops for some time, not that it hasn't stopped me from trying to learn to run my own game. ^^that ^^^will ^^^^happen ^^^^^one ^^^^^^day ^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^^Swear......\n\nThat said, I've got one or two old stories I never told from what is now \"Back in the day\", including a D&amp;D Story that I should probably share. \n\nOne word of warning. I am not a D&amp;D player, so gameplay wise I can't speak to what happened or how, just that the DM said it did. So...yeah, if things happened that are technically 'wrong' blame him. I'm just along for the ride. \n\n------------------\n\n**CHARACTER LIST**\n\n* Myself - Playing someone elses..some sort of Dwarven Rogue I think? All I know is he had two weapons, so he could attack twice, and I had ZERO IDEA how to play him. This went well for me...poorly for everyone else. \n\n* The Kids - A group of local high school kids who visited the shop a lot. I didn't know them beyond 'Oh, hey' but they offered to let me play with them one week when we weren't playing 40K for some reason. I never did get invited back after this event.....\n\n* The DM - Another of said shop kids. It's his fault this happened, I swear. \n\n------------------\n\nSo, it was an off week for 40K. I think someone was missing, but either way, no game. Sad days in Armada-Land. It wasn't like I was losing a long time..the shop was a stupidly short drive from me, and even walking didn't take terribly long, but still. No game. Sad times. \n\nSo I ended up hanging around, fiddling with things at which point someone mentioned the local D&amp;D game was down a man, I could fill in. \n\nNow, I tend to stick to Sci-fi and such so D&amp;D, outside the basics, is totally outside my realm of knowledge. I've picked up a 3rd edition book and flipped through it all of twice, but they go 'Don't worry, we'll cover the rules gaps!' Works for me!\n\nSo we start. We're doing a quest, blah blah, things happen. And we're being guided around by a talking sword one character has that happens to talk with a jive-like accent that amused all of the teenagers. Whatever man, it's your fantasy world. \n\nSo we end up travelins, doing things, and find an encounter. I don't remember what we fought at first, but we kick it's ass, and then we hear...something. In the shadows we see a giant figure, cloaked in mist and roaring at us. The GM said to basically treat it like an angry Evangelion when he mentioned the beasts name and I gave him a blank look.\n\nOk, so giant murder-cyborg. I can deal with that. Except...wait..dwarf. Alright, not too great. The other kids are freaking out about this, expecting a long and bloody fight. I, on the other hand, decide I have a plan and turn to our barbarian.\n\n\"Hey..can you fastball special me?\" \"W...What? You want me to do a WHAT to you?\" \"A [Fastball Special](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastballSpecial).\" I then proceed to have to explain what this is. This makes the barbarian perk up, and he promptly agrees and picks me up and whips me at the creature. \n\nBy pure luck, I manage to land on it and avoid falling off. And now it's pissed, but I'm on the back of it's neck and tell the DM \"Alright, I stab at it's neck.\" \n\nNow, the way this had been explained to me I got two attacks because I had two weapons. The Gm then ALSO decided \"Well it can't see you, it's not sure where you are...you get double attacks because of sneak attack!\"\n\nWait...what? I confirm what I heard, and yes, he claims I can make four attacks. I promptly roll and start to beat this thing like it's going to start spitting candy everywhere if I do it right. I finish my turn, and on the ground...there's a bit of movement, an attack thrown that misses, and the giant does nothing but try and advance on them. My turn again.\n\nI've decided to get in character, and say my character is furious. So, he starts swearing as he's hacking away at this thing, in three different languages. Once again, four attacks. I roll amazingly well as well, and the GM decides that I manage to bust through it's skin and skull, and directly attack it's brain....and it dies. In a total of two rounds. \n\nAnd then, it apparently in it's death throes, plane shifts. So the party simply hears a line of swearing that'd strip paint from a wall suddenly vanish with a soft 'pop' and the large shrouded figure that was advancing on them vanish as well, all the mist promptly clearing up. \n\nWhat happens next took a minute or two in 'game time' for my character, but apparently 'seconds' for the other players. I don't know either. \n\nSo, I'm not in...some other plane, floating on the corpse of this dead giant, still pissed. I can see...things...and know if I stay here, I'm probably dead. I shrug, and tell the GM \"Well, this thing took me here. I jam my fist into it's brain, grab something that doesn't seem right, and squeeze it.\" \"Do you stop swearing?\" \"Hell no. He's not stopped since he landed on this stupid thing.\"\n\nThus, across a few more fantastic rolls, I manage to force this things corpse to plane shift one more time via a mix of screwing with it's brain and pure, relentless rage. The other players see me 'pop' back into being, now riding a corpse and still swearing my head off. \n\nThe game ended there, a bit early for them. The GM had no idea what to do next, as that fight was probably supposed to take some time. \n\nAnd that's my one story of my adventures in D&amp;D. ",

The only reason he managed to get inside is because he borrowed a cloak to cover his grotesque appearance and rolled pretty amazingly on a stealth check. So Teid is in this city and as he finishes his shopping he realizes he's being followed by a group of three shady individuals. He decides he's going to slip into an alley and hide. As the shady group walks in he jumps out and grabs one, putting his freshly obtained sword to his throat.\nHe proceeds to threaten to murder the man if the three don't quickly explain themselves and one member of the group manages to stammer out that they're very impressed by what he just did and have suddenly changed their minds; now they want him to join their guild. Now Teid had been warned of the thieves guild by the king himself, and he decides that he'll follow them to the location of the guild and check it out.\n\nTeid follows the thieves into the stereotypical sewer guild hall that appears for thieves guilds all the time (thanks Elder Scrolls) and every member immediately draws on him. He rolls for persuasion and fails, the group all laugh at the one man trying to talk down an entire guild of people with weapons ready to attack. One of the three men he was travelling with interject and explain the events in the alley. Sir Teid goes on to elaborate upon that, removing his cloak and revealing his grotesque appearance. A few guild members throw up, one gets very excited and asks how that's even possible, and the guild master begins to ask how he got through town without being killed, as the people don't take kindly to lycanthropes.\nTeid goes on to tell them that not only did he travel through town, he was knighted by the king (true story) without even being noticed.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" The guild leader asks\n\n\"Because I have a sneak modifier of plus seven and I rolled a 16 so I got a fucking 23\" replies Teid, very excitedly\n\n\"I don't know what that means but I'm impressed\"\n\nHe goes on to explain the guild's plan to steal the king's enchanted breast plate (Bind on equip by fastening to nipples, removal also removes nipples) and asks if Teid can help.\n\nNow Teid is plotting against the king he's meant to be helping and as DM I get to watch as hilarity ensues while he attempts to sneak a large party of thieves through a heavily guarded castle.",

        "text": "So we were playing a 3.5e game with a massive party and two dms; I think there were approximately fourteen people there. I think it'd take way too long to introduce all of the dramatis personae, so the major players are:\n\n-Myself (Lawful Evil Sorcerer named Zordon Zamzay. He was an elven chef whose parents abandoned him at a young age with the restaurant, so he decided to sell the place and go out to find his parents and have them explain his heritage and why he can do magic)\n\n-Panda (Lawful Good Paladin whose name escapes me. He was a pretty generic paladin as far as characterization goes. Do the right thing, turn the other cheek etc. etc.)\n\nSo we're working as hired muscle to guard a caravan, and on the way we run into a group of trolls. No big deal; we basically have a full burger king kids club of players, and there's nothing that can really touch us at this level. We easily massacre the things, and in traditional player fashion we loot them for everything they have. At this point I turn to our DM and start asking questions about the loot.\n\n&gt;Z: Are their weapons still intact? \n\n&gt;DM: I mean, I see no reason why they wouldn't be. \n\n&gt;Z: What weapons were they using?\n\n&gt;DM: They were all using trashed up rusty cutlasses. They're maybe worth a few copper in steel, but the blades are pretty much wedges at this point. \n\n&gt;Z: I want to hoard the swords.\n\n&gt;DM :All of the swords? \n\n&gt;Z: All of the swords.\n\n&gt;DM: They're basically useless and will weigh you down. You won't be able to carry anything else while you have the swords in your inventory. You'll be pretty much useless in combat unless you put down the swords.\n\n&gt;Z: I want all of the swords\n\n&gt;DM: Fine, you pick up all of the swords. \n\nOn our way back to town, we had a brief run-in with some kobolds, during which I was roleplaying to the fullest extent. \n\n&gt;Panda: \"ZORDON! HELP ME! I WILL NOT PERISH TO THESE MEASLY MONSTERS!\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"I can't, I have swords in my hands\"\n\n&gt;Panda: \"Put down the damn swords!\" \n\n&gt;Me: \"But what if someone steals them?\" \n\n&gt;Panda: \"Nobody will steal your damn swords!\"\n \n&gt;Me: \"Well we don't know that for certain now, do we?\"\n\nSo we arrive in the village with a very battered and salty paladin, and a set of swords in the hands of a useless sorcerer. I walk up to the nearest townsperson, and rolled for gather information relatively well, despite the fact that I was buried under a small mountain of rusted steel when I talked. Turns out there is a pretty rich nobleman who's recently opened a blacksmith nearby. At this point, I was visibly cackling out of character. \n\n&gt;DM: \"What's up, what's so funny?\" \n\n&gt;Me: \"Nothing, nothing. Just... uh... imagining the reaction of the people around my character...\"\n\nSo we all show up at the blacksmith's, and Zordon waddles in under a really poorly made suit of rusted steel blocks. Zordon then gingerly removes each sword from his hands, taking care to not to scratch them or dust off any flecks of rust. He then leans on the counter, and gives the blacksmith a sly look. \n\n&gt;Zordon: \"Have I ever got a deal for you!\" \n\n&gt;Noble blacksmith: \"Evening, traveller! What is this deal you speak of?\" \n\n&gt;Z: Say, have you ever heard of the dragonslayers?\n\n&gt;NB: Can't say I have, traveller. Who are they?\n\n&gt;Z: They're a famous group of powerful adventurers who have conquered many great beasts, including the dragons of old! \n\n&gt;NB: Really, now? Where are these great warriors?\n\n&gt;Z: You're looking at them, sera!\n\nThe dm tells me to roll for bluff. \n\n&gt;18 + 5\n\n&gt;NB: Truly? I can not believe it! Tell me of your recent exploits, noble adventurer!\n\n&gt;Z: Well, you see, myself and the great party behind have recently slain a great dragon, and his blood coats the blades in front of you!\n\nThe DM asks me to roll for intimidate. \n\n&gt;18 + 3\n\n&gt;NB: I can not believe it! A noble beast, felled by such poor steel?\n\n&gt;Z: Well, you see, draconic blood is corrosive. When his blood stained our blades, it has ruined their edge. \n\nDm tells me to roll again to convince a merchant of the properties of dragon blood. \n\n&gt;17+5\n\n&gt;NB: I see, I see. What do you require of me, noble dragonslayer?\n\n&gt;Z: Well, these blades are of no use to us now, and we wish to sell them.\n\n&gt;NB: What use would I have of such poor steel? \n\n&gt;Z: Dragon blood is filled with such great magic that reforging it will make the blade twice sharper for every year that the dragon has lived. \n\nDM tells me to roll to convince the merchant of the properties of dragon blood once again. \n\n&gt;20+5\n\n&gt;NB: Yes, this is well known amongst us great smiths. But where did you find such a dragon, and how did you fell it?\n\n&gt;Z: We purchased a flying machine from an inventive dwarf, and used it to ride the air to the beast's lair. \n\nDM is flabbergasted at this point. Asks me to roll again. \n\n&gt;18+5\n\n&gt;NB: Ah, that makes sense. \n\n&gt;Z: Yes, now, shall we speak of price? These swords are very valuable, and will fetch quite a pretty penny. \n\n&gt;NB: What price do you think is fair?\n\n&gt;Z: 250 gold pieces. Per sword. \n\nDM doesn't even know what to say. Tells me to roll for persuasion once again. \n\n&gt;20+5\n\nAnd that's how you make 2250 gold in the first hour of the game. \n\nI have a few other tales from the dragonslayers campaign if you're interested.\n\nEdit: I accidentally submitted this to the wrong subreddit.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/46tfut/arma_iii_the_story_of_how_i_got_out_alive_from/",
        "text": "*All right, so firstly I would like to start with an introduction as to what ArmA III actually is. It's a quite realistic military simulator that pretty much allows you to take upon any role you want, be it either a pilot, a tank crew member, infantry and pretty much everything you can think of. The map is huge, there are a ton of mods and the possibilities are huge. Today, I was playing with some friends against AI. I was the commander of an [M1A2 Abrams MBT](http://www.armyrecognition.com/images/stories/north_america/united_states/main_battle_tank/m1a2/pictures/Abrams_M1A2_Main_Battle_Tank_US_Army_United_States_019.jpg). Now, onwards with the story proper.*\n\n\nI was given a mission by HQ, a mission which would prove to be deadly. I was tasked with the destruction of an insurgent outpost. I was told they'd only have a couple of lightly-armed personnel carriers. Of course there was also infantry involved, but they didn't seem to have a lot of anti-tank capability. They set up their base near an old, abandoned farmhouse so there weren't any serious fortifications set up, except for a couple of machine-gun emplacements. \n\nSo, out I went into the field with my crew and trusty Abrams. Even though I did have my insecurities about this mission (only one tank against an entire outpost, even if lightly armed?) but alas, *\"Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die.\"*. I was coming up on an old road, maybe a kilometre away from their hastily set up base. I went up a small hill to my left. Mind you, the environment we're talking about here is pretty much woodland, grassy hills and forests everywhere (imagine an Eastern-European countryside). There it was. Of course, moments after, one of their men must've spotted me.\n\n*Snap, crackle, pop. Smoke, dust. A hail of bullets. Explosions. Mortars? Tanks?*\n\nI gave the order to engage at will. And then I saw them. [T90s](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nXDl_r_AqcQ/maxresdefault.jpg). I felt as if a big, gaping hole had opened up in my chest. My crew fired the cannon but I knew that if we didn't back out fast we would be wrecked in seconds, we were sitting ducks before anyway. Seconds before I was about to give the order to fall back, those T90s fired their main guns on me in an instant.\n\n*Loud explosion. Smoke everywhere, alarms going off. Bail out.*\n\nOne crew member died almost immediately after he left the tank. So much smoke, I could see soldiers heading for us, they seemed so close to me... Me and the gunner of the tank managed to run away. Bullets were whizzing past us. I got shot, but it must've been in the shoulder or something because I kept running for an old warehouse in the distance. I couldn't see the gunner, but now I didn't care about him. I just had to run as far away as I could. Good thing is I still had my M4 carbine and Beretta M9 pistol with me so I could defend myself from their infantrymen. Not so much from their tanks though. I also had two smoke grenades - one red and one white.\n\nI managed to get to the warehouse, after a while they had stopped pursuing me. I got to the highest floor of the warehouse. I was able to see outside, quite a wide field of view in fact. The enemy was nowhere to be seen now. Now, where was the gunner? After a few minutes of looking around, I could see him barely walking outside. He was most likely injured. However, I decided to stay until he got closer to the warehouse so that I wouldn't be exposed for too much while tending to some of his wounds. \n\n*Loud bang in the distance, pop. Crackle. Puff of blood. Gone.*\n\nJust like that, they killed him. In a matter of seconds. I knew they were coming after me as well, wanting to finish the job. I signalled one of my friends to come and pick me up with his chopper (that was also crewed, it had mini-guns on it as well). I popped a smoke outside, and hoped that the chopper would come quicker than the enemy forces. I could see them, they were running up the road, just 10 or so infantrymen but I was only one person... I remember it so vividly, the sparks flying off the rusty metal walls of the warehouse as they lit it up with their bullets...\n\n*Helicopter in the distance. Salvation coming. The growl of the mini-guns.*\n\nThe [MH-60M](http://www.helis.com/database/pics/news/2015/mh-60m_mslass.jpg) was nearing. The infantrymen were going down like flies, but the chopper was taking fire as well. There was no time to linger around, I had to run. Fast. I ran down the steps, and dashed for the chopper that quickly landed nearby. Suffice to say, I got out alive that day. But my crew members, even if they were AIs, did not.\n\n\nMind you, this was not scripted. My mission was to go there, destroy their outpost and get back. But what was supposed to be a simple mission turned out to be one of the best experiences in gaming I've had for a while. *Welcome to Arma.*",

        "text": "Main quest spoilers ahead.\n\nI made the right call the first time around. I walked in, walked out and should not have looked back. But no, that conscience of mine just would not let up, would it? Well, now I'll have all of eternity to ponder the multitude of bad decisions that led me here.\n\nThe first one would probably be breaking into that damn incontinent priest's house. Oblivion take the old man, he couldn't hold his bladder till morning, when I and his valuables would be long gone. Of course, I could've scoped the place out a bit better. Maybe then I wouldn't have jumped out the window with the tree outside it, so I wouldn't have broken my leg and gotten caught. Instead of being ears-deep in wine, women and debauchery, I had a solid two decades of rotting in a dank prison to look forward to.\n\nOh, but that just was not my fate. No, I got taken to Morrowind. I'd heard Dunmer talk about the homeland and its customs, so my first thought was that some of the guards were in cahoots with the plantation owners and they sold my pasty ass to slavery. When there was no fancy-looking Dunmer waiting for me, I thought they'd simply decided to execute me in the middle of nowhere. But that, also, did not happen. No, I got released. The bastards took me to the ass end of nowhere, gave me some coin, a package and told me to bugger off to see someone named Cosades. So I did. After all, it was the only bit of direction I had in my brand new life. I traveled to Balmora, asked around and found out where he lives. Walked in and the first thing that hit me was the stench of stale sweat. A pile of moon sugar on the table, a skooma pipe shoddily stashed under the bed and a scrawny, half-naked old man, staring at me with unfocused eyes. He was probably too baked on the sugar to properly register that someone had just walked in, so I elected to simply turn around, leave and figure out my own way. Surely there'd be need for someone with my skills.\n\nWhen you've picked enough locks, they start to feel the same. Like running into an old friend in an unfamiliar town, a lock you know in a house you haven't been to is a reassuring feeling. I don't know who taught these ashy pricks to make locks, but they should be shown how it's done in a civilized land. Apparently, the skills I'd honed in Cyrodiil were useless on this rock. It's like I was 8 again and still figuring out how to properly hold a lockpick. At least their blades were familiar enough that I could make a living with one.\n\nEight months. That's how long I've been here. Eight months. The first seven weren't that bad. I kept moving from city to city, chasing rumors and leads of anyone with a job for someone deft with a blade. When none could be found, I would stride out into the wilderness and find a Dwemer ruin to plunder. One could make a small fortune with their old coins. I ventured into the shrines of Daedra worshipers and left them broken and broke. The small arsenal of demon weapons I have stashed away is proof enough of how good I've gotten. And if I hadn't decided to scour through my pack one night, I'd probably still be out there, trudging through ash and mud to some distant black tower.\n\nI thought I threw out the package. I thought I dropped it off on Cosades' table before I left. Apparently, I didn't. Better late than never, right? I went back to his place in the morning and dumped it on the table. He didn't seem to notice, so I prodded him to direct his attention to the letter. When I mentioned a package for him, it was like someone lit a torch: his eyes immediately cleared and focused on me like a hunter on a stag. Within minutes, I was press-ganged into his service as a novice in the Blades and given orders to talk to some leads about something called the Nerevarine. The jobs were easy enough and the pay sufficient to carry them out along my travels, so I didn't argue much.\n\nI really should have argued more. As I carried out his orders, I found that the Nerevarine isn't a thing, it's a person. Some Dunmer hero that's supposed to be reincarnated at some point. And then he laid on me the reason behind me getting shipped to Vvardenfell: the Emperor thinks I may be it and Cosades agrees. Don't know how they figure that, since Nerevar was Dunmer and I'm Breton, but I guess prophecy works in mysterious ways. Cosades thought that the evidence was enough to send me to see an Ashlander wise woman and have her test me. Unsurprisingly, I failed. Took the news back to him and thought that would be the end of our so-called partnership. He immediately sent me to deal with some prick called Dagoth Garres. Well, I found the bastard in a hole filled with Corprus victims. I even killed him without much trouble. Surely, this will be the end of it, right? I'm not this great hero, I filled my final orders and now I'm off to make my own way again, right? Hah, no. Garres had enough air in his repeatedly perforated lungs to curse me with Corprus.\n\nWhich brings me to now. Here I am, sitting behind my desk in what used to be the manor of the Nerano family, with a bottle of brandy, regretting everything I did over the past month. Well, I have plenty of time to keep doing that. Corprus victims won't die of old age, they'll only get stronger, dumber and uglier. I've run into enough of them to know how my future looks. I'll go back to Cosades in the morning, curse his eyeballs out, tell him to shove a battleaxe lengthwise up his own rectum and then I'll pick a fight with my Golden Saint. Maybe she'll actually kill me this time.\n\nBy the Nine, I need another bottle.",

        "text": "One time the party's two main combatants, Gorbad (a greatsword fighter) and Billy (a knife fighter), tried to turn themselves in with the help of the jack of all trades (Noriko) to collect the bounty on their heads. The bounty was there because the two of them had killed a bunch of sailors, a handful of marines, and blew up a slaver's ship while in port. The explosion in turn killed a handful of city watch and disfigured the not-to-be-fucked-with Sheriff. So the authorities knew they were extremely dangerous. The party face/leader/rogue, Da'at, wanted nothing to do with this plan.\n\nGorbad, Billy, and Noriko approached two town guards in the open and Noriko told them she was turning the two criminals in for the reward. Seeing the known dangerous criminals the guards demanded they disarm. They did so willingly, not trying to hide any weapons on themselves (which would have been very easy for the knife fighter). The guards then put them in manacles and they STILL didn't resist. One of the two guards then went for back up and the criminals remained calm.\n\nSo the Sheriff shows up with a half dozen guards and leads them to the watch house. Once inside and out of sight the three master planners... don't do anything. The Sheriff gets the hefty reward from a locked chest and gives it to Noriko. THEN they spring their trap.\n\nThe Gorbad and Billy are surrounded by the half dozen guards, with Noriko a short distance away facing the Sheriff. Unsurprisingly there is no surprise round when Noriko takes a stab at the Sheriff with her spear. The party then all roll poorly on initiative allowing the Sheriff to go first (though his guards go after the PCs). The Sheriff is a spellcaster/fighter, which the PCs knew, and he opens up with Sleep.\n\nGorbad is now alone surrounded by six pissed off guards. He is unarmed, his hands are manacled behind his back, and his allies are now fast asleep. He uses his turn to try headbutting one of the guards, he misses. \"Nice try\" says the guard, who is then immediately headbutted by Gorbad's second attack. \"That one was better. Now it's our turn.\" Using their clubs they beat Gorbad into unconsciousness in a single round.\n\nDa'at hears about this by seeing a guard taking down the wanted posters, and asking him. He tells her the criminals have been apprehended along with a previously unknown associate. They are to be sold into slavery tomorrow. Da'at facepalms and then debates whether they are worth the coin at this point as she's not going to try to break them out. In the end she hands over the coin and legally owning the majority of the party.",

        "text": "In the past I have posted stories from my main group. Recently I have started DMing for a gorup of newcomers or mostly newcomers to D&amp;D. And they are murderhoboing hard\n\nLets meet them\n\nSmall DooDoo, the Gnome Fighter - My best friend's character and the one I hate the most: I hate the name, I hate the concept and I hate the character. But he's normally a lot of fun to play with and he always runs into my traps. a Chaotic Neutral maniac with amnesia who's ideal is to do 'whatever makes the most interesting story\n\nZilean Braveheart, Gnome Wizard - Normally the only sane man of the party, I am starting to suspect his own magical powers is giving him a minor God complex.\n\nOljorn, Half-Elf Ranger - Chaotic Good, emphasis on Chaotic. Rolled amazingly on his stats but rolls poorly in game. Manages to be extremely offensive by accident\n\nBeryl the Incrediberyl, Dragonborn Bard - By the far the best named character, Beryl is the strongest member of the party, and her acid breath has saved their arses more than once. However she is a complete and utter moron, with a 5 and 6 in intelligence and wisdom respectively.\n\nCorvo Carver, Tiefling Rogue/Warlock - Second most annoying party member, and accomplice of Small in their wacky schemes. Obsessed with sneaking around and stealing everything.\n\nVivivy, Tiefling Cleric/Bard - Lawful Evil, and yet one of the most down to earth and reasonable party members. Cleric of Tempest, and the main healer\n\nOur story starts with the party (sans Vivivy) returning to the town of Elwatch after securing a scroll from Hurnfist Hold. Vivivy had been arrested, alongside an innocent gnome, for the public disturbance caused by Small and Corvo in session one.\n\nBugglesby, the party's employer, informs them they've been summoned to defend their friend by Sir Gregory Munt, Head of Justice in the county and member of the Fists of Tyr, an order of Paladins.\n\nThe five arrive at Castle Munt without much issue and are quickly led in, spotting the jailhouse where Vivivy is presumably being held captive. They are quickly brought before Sir Gregory, who informs them that thier friend has been found guilty of numerous crimes (blatant framing). After a failed attempt at charming him, Zilean learns that some shady individuals have been seen in the local area and might have something to do with the framing.\n\nZilean decided he would try and investigate these individuals, while Beryl and Oljorn decided that they'd disguise themselves as guards and break Vivivy out. This was almost ruined by Corvo trying to break into the jailhouse and being spotted, but the rogue escaped.\n\nAt this point I made one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. As a side note, someone asked me if this was my plan.\n\n\"Sort of. There's the find evidence option, and there's a jailbreak option. Of course you guys have free will to do whatever.\"\n\nHearing this, Small asked who was well dressed in this room. I said Sir Munt and his wife were the best dressed. This led to him grappling said wife and holding a sword at her throat.\n\nGod. Fucking. Damnit.\n\n\"No one move, no one panic!\" screamed the Gnome as three guard leveled their crossbows at him. Munt rose, drawing his maul and casting Thunderous smite on it. Beryl, Zilean and Oljorn just stood there, horrified at their party member's actions.\n\n\"Let her go!\" Demanded the Paladin.\n\n\"Let my friend go, or I'll kill her.\" Retorted the tiny psycho.\n\nHowever, Munt had sworn an oath to uphold justice no matter what, and charged. Small sliced the wife's throat open, getting hit by one of the crossbow bolts and taking damage. Combat had begun.\n\nZilean went first, thunderwaving two guards against the wall. Oljorn followed up by shooting a heavy tapestry off the wall and onto them. Berly used her charm person to make the unhurt guard turn on Sir Munt. Meanwhile, the knight and the gnome were locked in a heated battle, but it was clear the Paladin had the upper hand.\n\nAs this commotion unravelled, Corvo successfully snuck into the jailhouse, stealthing past even a Spectator to break Vivivy and Quernstein (the innocent gnome) out. They were joined by some kind of sorcerer who was waiting for the right moment. After the sorcerer vaporised the Spectator they rushed out to see the chaos.\n\nBy now Small was badly hurt, whilst Oljorn was locked in melee with a guard. Beryl had finished off one of the guards under the tapestry and Zilean was using Chromatic orb on Munt to aid his gnome brethren. Corbo and Vivivy quickly entered the fray, evening the odds and Corvo commanded Quernstein to jump on a guards head.\n\nSmall was on death's door until Viviy healed him. Without that healing, Munt's next hit would have taken the Gnome Fighter out of the game. Zilean finally finished it with a chormatic orb, killing the Paladin. The party quickly looted the castle for gold as they heard the town watch being assembled.\n\nOutside they met with their new sorcerer friend. He introduced himself and asked for some kind of payment for his services. At first he asked for the scroll they had recieved, but they refused. So isntead he simply requested they all owed him a favour, and went off. The party escaped the castle and ran all the way back to Elwatch, only too discover Bugglesby had been kidnapped.",

        "text": "Kiiiind of a NSFW story. Reader be warned. Sex, Drugs, and Rock &amp; Roll follow.\n\nBackstory: We're playing a campaign set in a musical-themed world. Various races have various genres under their purview. Elves are hippies, tieflings are punk, it's a whole thing. It's awesome. We have magical instruments that don't need amplifiers.\n\nWe're an up-and-coming rock band, named Maelstrom formed of the motley-est crew you ever saw. I'm a blues halfling in a suit named John Bluesky, plays harmonica and sings. We have an elf raging barbarian named Lazerwolf (Drummer), an earth genasi storm cleric/keytarist named Matooine (i constantly forget how to spell it), a tiefling guitarist named Cyrus, a human special effects mage named Asterius the Cyberdemon (John's brother, they're both adopted). Generally, they're the type of group you really want to keep a d1000 carousing chart handy for. Y'know, a rock band. \n\nAnyways, we just signed a contract with a record company, who was giving us a test-job to see if we were any good. We had to drive out to a coastal city and play a show there when the ships came in. If it went well, we might get more work. A full day of shenanigans happened before we even started scouting a location. During the course of it, we learn a few things about a ship that's missing, Matooine's history with the place, got some tattoos from some girl that hated him, so on, so forth.\n\nWe chose the top of the lighthouse, which happened to be a local temple (Of which Matooine was a member, thankfully negotiating with them on our behalf. We had a montage preparing for the show, Matooine avoiding anyone he knew, Cyrus tuning up, Asterius setting up pyrotechnics, Lazerwolf hunting for roosters (He really REALLY had it out for roosters), and John drinking/schmoozin' it up with any loose women he could find. Also we all got some practice in. \n\nThe night of the show starts and we open with a bunch of songs about sailing and fighting and drinking (Think Flogging Molly). A storm starts to roll in, and we were wondering if we were summoning it by rocking out on the storm temple. The storm starts to really pick up, and we're rocking out in pouring rain, against a backdrop of fire and lightning. Fucking awesome. And then everyone makes Dex saves. John and Lazerwolf make theirs, everyone else gets struck by lightning. We don't realize something's PROPERLY up until we start playing the final song of the night and then a big creature made of lightning shows up. \n\nIt starts kicking our ass because its able to stay out of our reach for the most part, and inflict obscuring effects on us through the storm. We also see, through the clouds, that a ship out at sea is unable to make it to shore because of the mist and tossing waves and a giant octopus. Matooine is focusing on bringing the ship in while the rest of us are trying to not die. \n\nJohn has a bright idea to tie a rope to himself and the tower (Thanks Cunning action!) and incite the raging barbarian to through him at the lightning creature. The first throw goes poorly and he doesn't even make it off the tower. Matooine uses a gust of wind and the second throw is dead on. I lash myself to the creature and then yell at the others to pull me in. \n\nDuring this exchange, John has an even brighter idea. \n\n\"I roll to seduce!\" i say to the DM, who audible slams her face into her table. \n\nI roll a 19, and I have some good charisma. It works. It doesn't understand a damn word John says to it, but it gets the intention. \n\nAsterius, having some kind of \"My brother is about to get laid\" sense decides to be a bro for once and illusion a bedroom in the air instead of cock-blocking like he usually does.\n\nA couple rolls good rolls (And some borrowed inspiration) later and John emerges, half-dressed, from the illusion with the Lightning elemental clinging to his side. One triumphant cry of \"WE ARE MAELSTROM!\" later, and the crowd goes nuts, and the band is now local legends. \n\nIn the morning, the band has a new mascot, and John has a new groupie/girlfriend? that doesn't speak common.\n\ntl;dr: Summoned a a storm elemental with the power of rock, tamed it with the power of c-... well, you know.",

        "text": "Before I begin my tale I need to fill you in with a little backstory and introduce our party of adventurers.\n\nOur group has five characters:\nRapp, a charismatic and funny half-elf rogue with the most unlucky player I've ever seen. No, really. This guy manages to roll 3 nat 1 in a row per game.\nMax, a mysterious armored, uh, thing. I guess he's a cleric?\nVutor, a bunny necromancer.\nVicerion, a wise old elf shaman and hermit with a connection to spiritual world. Communicates with dead people and deities.\nAnd finally, my character: Megis, blind mind flayer sorcerer with a little cthulhu-familiar. He's a charmer.\n\nOur DM renewed our magic system recently. Instead of spells per day, every caster gets \"magic points\", which amount depends on level, casting stat and class. We describe the spell we do and DM tells us how many points it takes. It gives our imagination fly free as we try to think a way to torment our DM more.\n\nSo, let me introduce our story: Our party's mission was to prevent the uprising of devil Asmodeus by destroying some altars. When we destroyed an altar we found in a cave, we realised that something was different. Vutor used a Lore of the Gods-spell, succeeded the knoweldge roll perfectly and found out that we had travelled 1000 years into the future. Megis then found out that time travelling wasn't really used in our time and we are probably stuck in the future for a while. \n\nWe then realised that the future we landed in was in huge war between racist humans and resistance of oppressed races fighting for their freedom. The resistance asked us to join the siege and assassinate two human leaders while the main forces prepare the huge surprise attack. We of course agreed and thought that this would be sweet stealth mission with tons of loot and xp. However, with our party, the stealth was pretty much failed from the beginning.\n\nWe sneaked to the huge 50-feet wall surrounding the enemy city and resistance wizards casted us invisible. Rapp proceeded climbing up the wall and dropping rope for us. After everybody managed to climb up and Vicerion has scouted the area with his owl, we descended to other side of the wall with the rope. When everybody else was safely down, Rapp untied the rope and rolled 1 for climbing down. He then tried to save himself with a reflex save but failed that too and he hit the ground hard. Megis casted Detect magic to find his magic items and Vutor healed the poor rogue.\n\nAfter the failing on the wall we sneaked to the main building where the leaders were told to be. Vicerion and Rapp scouted the building a bit while the others tried to form a plan to get in. We realised that the only way in was the front door with four guards. Megis casted an illusion that the door stayed closed and Vutor casted Silende so nobody would hear us going in.\n\nAfter a little wandering inside we found a room with the first leader, a human paladin with to archers playing Magic: the gathering. Rapp opened the door slightly and peeked inside. The paladin noticed this, came to the door and looked into the hallway where we tried to be as quiet as possible. After the paladin had returned to the room, we formed a terrible plan: Vicerion entered the paladin's mind and tried to find information about human forces and after that Megis would throw a bomb inside the room with Vutor's Silence. After the plan was executed, we realised that Vicerion's invisibility had dropped and the bomb had demolished the whole room and the shock had alerted sleeping guards in the next room. We then interrogated, killed, stored their bodies inside the room and magically locked the door after us.\n\nThen we realised how screwed we were. Vicerion, Rapp, Megis and Max had lost their invisibility in the fight and we needed to find the second leader. Rapp could cast an invisibility on himself again but other casters were kinda low on magic points already. We then used Rapp to find the second leader. He was a paladin too with to rangers discussing about war tactics. When Rapp peeked inside the door he failed the awareness check with nat 1 and didn't noticed paladin's jumpy little bodyguard who threw the door open and slashed the air with his sword. Rapp got hit so he alerted the others. By this point, we realised that stealth was pretty much gone and we rushed to our rogue friend killing every guard in our way.\n\nIn the room the paladin and rangers barricaded themselves behind fallen table while the bodyguard threw smokebombs in the hallway and circled around through other door to attack Rapp. After that he retreated in the room and threw a bomb at the wall creating a hole so he and paladin could escape. It was a third floor so the landing was quite rough.\n\nAfter that we realised that we needed to go after him. Megis threw a bomb at remaining rangers. The bomb blasted one of the rangers and the floor while the other ranger was killed by Max's Spiritual weapon. Vicerion rushed to the hole in the wall and noticed that bodyguard and paladin were recovering from the fall. Shaman needed to act quick, so he entered in bodyguard's mind and commanded him to blow himself up. Bodyguard obeyed the command and bombarded himself and two guards beside the front door, where they landed. Paladin took heavy damage from that but healed himself. After that Megis found out that he had fallen love in his bombs so he threw one out of the hole after the paladin. Paladin survived the bomb and tried to escape inside. \n\nWe realised that the paladin was going to alert every guard in the city if we didn't kill him quickly. We also realised that he was two floors right below us so we took another bomb and blasted the ceiling on the paladin. Rapp tried to finish the paladin off by taking a bomb and throwing it down on him. There were no way he could fail this, right? Wrong. Natural 1 for the win and Rapp blasted himself down one floor. He luckily managed to save himself with evasion (rolled 2 but his relfex modifier was 15) and he survived the explosion. Max jumped on the paladin dealing pretty damage and Vicerion used a hold person on him. Megis shot couple Magic missiles at him and after taking over 70 points damage, the paladin was down and mission was complete.\n\nEpilogue:\nAfter we escaped with some shady guy giving us ability to fly, Rapp felt that he wasn't done. He asked Megis to give him a bomb and the he flew back to the city's wall and threw the bomb killing seven archers while taking eight arrows to the face and falling down from sky. The shady guy had to carry him back to the base.\n\nSorry for the spelling, I'm not a native english speaker.",

        "text": "WoK: Episode 1\n\nGeneral Warning: WoK is a heavily homebrewed form of D&amp;D, and as such, should be really laid back and fun. That being said, the following is a session that my DM put into book form. Enjoy! -Player Rogue \n\nOur story begins with a letter, one handed out by a red haired messenger on a variety of notice boards throughout Klash. It reads:\n\n“We are recruiting fresh, young, vibrant souls to do what has yet to be done. A new project to reclaim Solstik for the Intellects is underway, and all the lands have come together to pave Solstik into a peaceful area where we can successfully meet with other nations and resolve conflict in an area without allegiance. Should you choose to accept this task, and are successful, you will aid in creating a new world without war, where peace can last forever. Gold and treasure will be yours, and so will the satisfaction that you’ve been a true hero of your time. Potential recruits should meet in Aedrian City, the base of the push. Meet with Sir Raleigh Waiss, he will guide you on where to go.\n\n-Ultimedes, Lead Chancellor of Dridium”\n\nSo, all of our adventurers decided to leave their respective duties, and head into the vast unknown that is Solstik. Vult, a Blitzer Spritz hailing from Triniak, headed from his village for his first adventure. Valthior, a aristocratic Tree Hopper Elf with a taste for fine wine saw this as an opportunity to leave the continent of Konstruct to pursue his lost love in a new land. Rainer, a Monster Hunter Human from The Roil, stopped contracting here to breathe some fresher air. Rhasja, a disgraced Pirate King, seeks to raise his army to reclaim his homeland in Solstik, for weak hearted man will be scarce in such a land. And finally Rogue, a mysterious Swamp Walker Elf seeks to lighten the purses of a few unlucky travelers in a new land.\n\nInside the only open tavern in Aedrian City is Rainer, drinking by himself to relax after a long journey to this new land. He samples the local brew, Aedrian Ale, served up by the barkeep, Cirque de Aedrian. It’s not long until he is joined by a stranger, Valthior.\n\n“I hear that you are a hunter of beasts, is that true?” asks the Treehopper.\n\n“Who’s asking?” asks Rainer, who’s heard this pitch one too many times in this city already. Valthior pulls out a large coin purse and drops it on the table.\n\n*thud*\n\n“Aye, I’m a Monster Hunter, Rainer. Who the hell are you?”\n\n“My name isn’t important, but I’ll give it to you as a sign of trust. Valthior, of Konstruct. I have a little mission for you, Rainer.”\n\n“I’m listening.”\n\n“I’ve no doubt that your skills in hunting beasts are unrivaled, but how about your skills in hunting.. people?”\n\n“I’m no head hunter.” retorts Rainer as he turns away from Valthior, forfeiting the gold on the table.\n\n“Hmm,” Valthior pulls another coin purse from his bag, this one at least three sizes larger than the first. “How about now?”\n\n“You’ve got my nose, and my blade, so long as you have coin, you have me,” pledged Rainer.\n\nAs this discussion was taking place, a conniving Rogue was sitting at the bar, watching the events transpire. His eyes flashed as he saw the Tree Hopper unveil the coin purse.\n\n“I’m searching for a Spritz,” continued Valthior.\n\nRainer set his drink down, took an eye around the bar, and grabbed a little spritz by the scuff of his neck. “This him?”\n\n“I’m afraid it won’t be that easy, Rainer.” Rainer tossed the young spritz aside, who skidded along on his backside, then got up and sat with the Monster Hunter as if they were well acquainted friends.\n\n“Alright, since I’ve already offered, could you maybe tell me a few things about your target? Is this the love of your life you were talking about?”\n\n“How unelvish! I mean.. I have nothing against the breeding between races, but the thought of that spritz in any fashion other than my hands around his neck infuriates me!”\n\n“My apologies. So then we’re hunting this spritz to kill him, or at least get answers.”\n\n“Precisely. Can you help?” asked Valthior, looking at Rainer with such attentiveness that he shifted a little in his seat.\n\n“Aye, I can help you. But I must say, you haven’t given me a lot to go on.”\n\n“And had I had more to go on, perhaps my sweet would be in my arms now. Alas monster hunter, I am confident that together, the two of us will find her.”\n\n“You mean three!” exclaimed the little Spritz sitting beside Rainer.\n\n“My apologies,” Valthior said courteously, “did you mean to come along, young one? Fair warning, that I’m not paying you.”\n\n“Money isn’t my goal, I want to see the world! You taller bunch seem to be a lot of fun actually.”\n\n“Hmm, well three is better than two, I suppose.” said Rainer. “What’s your name, pup?”\n\n“Vult sir, Vult Ampiere.”\n\nWell, Vult, welcome to our little party,“ welcomed Valthior.\n\n“Look at that damn Elf, flaunting his riches like he’s heels above everyone,” muttered Rogue under his breath. “If his gold weighed him down to head level with us, then perhaps I’d let him hold on to it. And look at that spear on the back of the spritz! No way that’s his. Is that titan bone?” Rogue looked enviously at the party, then casually snuck up to their booth, taking a seat opposite them.\n\nHe glanced back at the enticing spritzen spear and drew his hand from beneath his cloak. Closer and closer it came, until he almost had his hands entirely wrapped around the eloquent lance. Suddenly, the spritz jumped and evaporated in a bolt of lightning. “That tickled!” exclaimed Vult from across the room. Now, Rogue stood with an outstretched arm at what looked like Rainer’s purse of newly acquired coin.\n\n“What, have we got a thief in our audience?” Rainer stood threateningly, turning his full attention to Rogue.\n\n“No sir, not I, I was simply.. picking up this coin that you seemed to have dropped for you.”\n\n“A likely story, elf,” snarled Rainer, who began to rear back to punch Rogue. He swung, but Rogue ducked, the punch flying over his head. Rogue took advantage of this, and dove into Rainer, knocking them both to the ground. Vult stood beside them, excitement making his hair stand up and the static in the air grew powerful. Valthior just leaned back, watching the brawl while muttering to himself, “Very Unelvish.”\n\nAfter the two had fought to the point of near exhaustion, in walked Rhasja, the Bannerhold Heavyborn, who grabbed both of them and knocked them out by clashing their ankles together with such strength that they both went limp. “Who are they? Rhasja asked Valthior.\n\n\"Well, one is my employee, and the other is a thief who just attempted to steal from him.”\n\n“You weren’t going to intervene?”\n\n“If that man couldn’t win against a simple thief, then what good would he be to me?” observed Valthior.\n\n“Fair point, but if he’s a Monster Hunter, then this couldn’t possibly be just any common thief.”\n\n“Very true words, friend,” agreed Valthior.\n\n“So, would you care to tell me what your name is?”\n\n“Not at all. I’m Valthior, a certain.. connoisseur of fine drink. This little pup that’s with me is Vult. Who are you?” inquired Valthior.\n\n“My name is Rhasja, Rhasja the Unbroken.”\n\n“The disgraced pirate king??” asked Valthior incredulously.\n\n“Aye, though I don’t plan to stay that way. I came to this city in search of men who will join my crew so that I may fly her banner once more.”\n\n“A noble venture, though we all know your true intent. You wish to succeed where you failed in the past: you wish to reclaim Al'alade'eme for yourself.”\n\n“If I be deemed worthy to win her over, then why shouldn’t I be king? At any rate, enough about me, what are we to do about these children?” asked Rhasja.\n\n“Well, they seem alright for the time being. What brings you to Solstik?”\n\n“As I said before, I’m in need of a crew!”\n\n“Surely you didn’t just hear about it, fate wouldn’t be that fair to the likes of me,” admitted Valthior.\n\n“Well, I suppose I also came here to be a part of Project Reclamation, to claim Solstik for the territories of Klash and wrest it from the grip of the Wilds.”\n\n“Interesting, that is also why I am here. Do you realize that we now stand in the Hearty Lion, the precise place that we were supposed to go to accept work?”\n\n“I suppose that is quite convenient. Who are we to talk to?”\n\n“If I’m not mistaken, we were to speak with a ‘Sir Raleigh Waiss.’ That name ring a bell?”\n\n“Yes, I do recall seeing it in the letter.”\n\nAnd so, Rhasja, Valthior, and Vult went over to the occupied booth to converse with Sir Raleigh Waiss about a job opportunity in Solstik, all the while Rainer and Rogue were unconscious in the corner of the Pub.",

        "text": "I'm currently running a Dark Souls tabletop with my players. Since we've had trouble getting together consistently for sessions, it's a pick-up game; anyone can play at any given time, and players can summon each other for ~~jolly~~ co-op.\n\nWe began last weekend. I walked my players through character creation, using the classes from Dark Souls 1 as a base. Iven the Hunter (who ironically used the stock Hunter image from Bloodborne as his character token) and Radimir the Cleric were created, and made their merry way to the first bonfire without much trouble.\n\nAnd then there was Bromaster.\n\nBromaster is a Deprived. If you've never played Dark Souls before, one of the classes you can select at character creation is Deprived. Unlike other classes, which gift you starting weapons, armor, and potentially spells, the Deprived class gives you nothing but a small loincloth, a wooden club, and a shield made of wooden planks tied together.\n\nEvery character started chained to a wall, since the beginning area is a prison. Iven and Radimir were able to yank the chains apart, since they were obviously rusted through and very weak. They proceeded to the next room and collected part of their starting equipment.\n\nBromaster chewed his arms off, killing himself in the process and reviving at the bonfire in a different part of the prison.\n\nBy this point, Iven and Radimir had weapons, armor, torches, and one Estus Flask (essential rechargeable healing item). Bromaster had none of these things.\n\nHe eventually made a torch out of the severed arm of a Hollow prisoner and began to wander around. In a large, multi-leveled room, all three separately encountered a towering door that was locked. The key was farther in the level (next to a useful item,) and Iven/Radimir journeyed off to get it.\n\nBromaster got pissed at the door, and rolled a Strength check to headbutt it. It came up as a 20. A natural 20. A crit, in other words.\n\nDown the door goes, and Bromaster proceeds to the next room, where he encounters a fog door. In Souls terms, that usually means that a boss-level enemy is lurking behind the white mist, and so he goes right through it.\n\nAnd dies to the very first boss in three rounds. Out of combat, that's eighteen seconds. He had twenty souls. My condolences, Bromaster. My deepest condolences.",

        "text": "So I've been playing RPGs for nine years now and needless to say it's a bit embarrassing that I have never, ever, killed a full-fledged dragon. I've killed gods, vampires, ogre warlords, angels, demons, devils etc. But I've never killed a full-fledged dragon.\n\nA friend of mine wanted to test some monsters he found for Scion (White Wolf Games), and we ran a one-shot today. I brewed up a Demi-God level Scion of Sun Wukong, named Sonny, with the Jingu staff, a headband that adds his Legend score to his Strength checks, the \"Hands of Buddha\" which are gauntlets that turned his punching in aggravated damage, and then a talking Nemean Gorilla named Vinnie as a sidekick. To sum that up in the minds of those who have never played, he has an indestructible size-expanding staff, anyone he punches bursts into flesh-confetti, and he has a gorilla the size of an elephant with the voice of Rocky from *Creed*.\n\nAnyway, in the game you are either a physical, social, or mental character; you can be a jack-of-all-trades but usually you fall into one of the three. I was a physical character and my two friends were social characters (Toru, an archer son of Tsukiyomi with two ninja companions and Katherine, a DJ scion of Horus with the threaded cane from *Bloodborne*). So we are sent onto the Overworld of the god Horus, which is a forest on the back of a giant turtle. We head to a cave to face off against a dragon and his army of armoured drakes, which he has been collecting in preparation for something that worries the gods, we must discover his reasons and if they are sinister then have him stop.\n\nWe enter the cave and quickly come across five of the drakes in question, they are set for a lower-tier of heroes and the fight was pretty sad. Essentially the archer got the killing blow on one only because Sonny face-ploded one and he attacked the weak point. Our DJ had very few results with her threaded cane attacks. Sonny killed the other four each in one hit with various, incredibly gory, results. Sonny with four kills, one major assist.\n\nRealizing as we go further in that we are already getting close to the dragon's lair, the two social characters state that as I'm probably the only one who could even do enough damage to bypass the dragon's damage-soak, we should all try speaking to it first. When they enter the lair, the ring of drakes around the dragon back off seeing Sonny coated in scales, blood and guts from their fallen comrades. The dragon is resting and Sonny flies up on his nimbus to the dragon and demands it awaken to speak to his friends, when the dragon asks why he should even speak to them, Sonny merely says \"ask them\".\n\nToru asks the dragon to cease and desist gathering drakes, he refuses; Toru then vaguely threatens that if he continues the gods will take action, the dragon asks why three demi-gods came instead and Toru states it's a warning. His intimidation easily fails and the dragon threatens to eat us, to which Sonny responds that would just put him closer to the dragon's heart. So Kat asks why he is gathering the drakes, the dragon refuses to answer but then she manages to convince him by alluding to him that we could help him achieve it in exchange for leaving the turtle. \n\nHe then reveals that his plan is to gather the drakes and use them to invade the underworld to free his father, Nidhogg/Nidhoggr. He doesn't name him but merely explains that his father is trapped down there, which causes Sonny to ask \"you mean the Norse snake thing?\" (Mental stats are his worst area). The Dragon is greatly angered but resists outright attacking Sonny, scolding him instead for calling his father a snake. \n\nThe two other team members manage to bribe him away from the dragon and to be quiet by promises of sex (we had a running joke the three of them all sleep with each other during down time and Kat specifically had very high appearance). The two are debating what to do as assisting him would kick-start Ragnarok, which would put them on good terms with the dragon but would basically declare war on the Nordic pantheon and all its Scions.\n\nSonny gets tired of waiting and wants to kill the dragon for the bragging rights (none of the players or GM knew this was my first true dragon fight) so he calls Kat over and asks honestly why wouldn't we just allow the dragon to eat him and he kills it from the inside. No one thinks of why that is a terrible plan and they tell the dragon they would allow him to eat Sonny if he ceases his plan. He agrees.\n\nI roll and manage to dodge his teeth and fly down his throat, but something's wrong, it's too bright, it's then that I realize his fire breath comes from his belly and he's attempting to burn me inside. I expand the Jingu staff by it's width and use it as a shield, still getting burned but my own soak, from both divine armour and my own superhuman stamina, defuses it with no damage. I fly down into his belly and dodge the spewing stomach acids, and then proceed to angle my staff so that it would aim at the base of his neck and above his tail instead of his mouth and throat so it is forced to push out of him.\n\nThe Dragon is 100ft, my maximum length expansion for the Jingu was 320ft, I make it as wide as possible and then expand, since it expands using my legend and strength scores it's my strength versus his. In White Wolf games you roll pools of d10s and anything over 7 is a success, 10s are two successes, if you roll 1s they weaken your roll. I roll fourteen success, he rolls twenty-one; I roll thirteen successes, he rolls twenty-three; I roll 15 successes, he rolls nineteen. At this point it looks ridiculous from outside and the others hid behind rocks, I'm nearly suffocating and finally the dragon has decided to just throw up Sonny, so the GM says I can either hold onto the staff and stay inside or leave it while getting thrown up but allow it to expand again. I choose to expand and abandon it; nineteen successes, twenty with stunting for keeping it expanding while I fly away, dragon gets twenty successes, GM rules I win.\n\nStaff bursts out of the dragon as I fly out, slightly digested and at half-health. The others can't contribute, so I dive-bomb him and blow off part of his face, he misses his bite and then BOOM, I got a kill shot. Typicaly rule-of-cool choose you kill causes me to fly through his body retrieving my staff and eviscerating his heart.\n\nSonny lands before the army of drakes and holds up part of the dragon's heart shouting \"WHO IS YOUR GOD NOW?!\" Almost all of the drakes flee but nine remain to challenge them, he immediately dive bombs one and kills it, and the rest run off. They return to Horis who heals Sonny and is pleased they killed the dragon, but disappointed because now there's a army's worth of drakes wandering his Overworld, Sonny leaves to hunt them all one-by-one, whereas Toru and Kat have a party and Sonny doesn't end up getting that bribe Kat promised him.\n\nThe End.\n\n**EDIT**: It was Kokopelli, not Horus who was the God who sent us.",

And to think it had started off so lovely!\n \nThe night passed by uneventful. Bordel offered me a spot in his quarters which I accepted. Far better than just being in a bedroll under the stars.  This morning I helped Fernwood with preparing breakfast- who I must say reminds me of my Grandmother. Maybe it’s just me longing for stability. Fern isn’t overly talkative, but we had a nice chat as I assisted her. She’s from Havenfold, part of the Holdings Kingdom on Middlemere, and had come to Asura on news that trade was good. I do find it strange that such a mild mannered women would have bothered to answer Bordel’s call, but perhaps she’s more adventurous than myself.\n\nSoon all were awake and fed and we went about on traveling East in the hopes that Bahamut would take notice and summon us into his Kingdom. I remember thinking to myself that likely we were on a wild goose chase. Just another ‘do this and your God will fulfill’ kind of blanket promise.\nAs we walked on, the hours slipping by I figured out a solution to my situation. The towns we are to come along likely will have other caravans. Opportunity is bound to present itself and I will be taking it when I see it. The funny thing about it is I had thought of that before hell itself broke loose. I doubt I can escape this group fast enough.\n\nIt was amidst my daydreaming and mundane chitchat, that we stumbled upon a skeleton making factory. I don’t quite understand how it’s possible, but alas it was most unfortunate we came across it. I went with the group, the men all eager to destroy the abominations. I followed along for fearing if I stayed behind that the monsters might find me alone. \n\nI watched as the others fought valiantly. My fingers plucked away at my lyre, keeping the group's spirits up, mine as well. If anything, I needed them to maintain their moral. If they wavered in their courage, then we were doomed.\n\nThe good news, I’m still alive and giving record of the events. The bad news, Kimaris, Marcus, and Gizmo are no longer with us. After fighting a series of skeletons, we came to a river. The group began to jump over it. Fern and Marcus were successful while the rest of us fell into the water. It was such a fast paced river that I had to really focus my energies to navigate the waters and take a breath when a moment of calm came.\nThe rapids soon stopped, but the river continued to rush us along. I got a chance to look around and could see open plains on either side of the banks. I then caught sight of Bordel struggling against the current in his armor. Quickly I swam over to give him a hand. For the years he had on him, I was surprised my boss hadn’t learned to swim. He clung to my arm a bit too firmly while I fished out my rope. Once I managed to free the item, I looked around for something to secure it to.\n\nThat’s when I noticed a handful of boxes floating in the river with us, as well as some kind of folk hopping from box to box. Bordel seemed to notice this and seized the closest one to us. It so happened to be the one the small folk had jumped on. I threw the rope to him shouting, “Catch!” The man remained silent as he took one end of the rope. \n\nI held my breath, sinking beneath the current to rest a moment from keeping my head up. When I resurfaced I found the rope secured, which I must say was done rather fast, and Bordel clinging to the box that our small friend once stood upon.\n\nSeeing the rope secured, I summoned a translucent hand that I used to grab the rope and hold it firm so my boss could grab on and get to safety. The small person, helping us, surfaced and also grabbed onto the rope. We each in turn pulled ourselves ashore, Fern having caught up to us, made sure the rope held strong to the bridge it was attached to. \n\nOnce on shore and seeing that everyone was alive and breathing, thanking the Gnome who had come to help us, I went about drying our clothes and gear. I especially made sure the flute and lyre I had were well cared for. The lyre held most of my magics while the flute... that was all I had left of Achmath.\n\nAmidst drying off, we introduced ourselves to the Gnome whose name is Oda. He is mute and has a raven who speaks for him. \n\nI then noticed the lack of our companions.\n\n“Hey, where’s Marcus, Gizmo, and Kimaris, Fern?” I was actually very concerned about my companion not being around. Fern said Kimaris and Gizmo had fallen in, but Marcus she hadn’t seen since she left the cave after us. Before we could do a proper search, one of the boxes in the river exploded, revealing another skeleton. The abomination scarcely relished in it’s new found life for Bordel and the others made quick work of it.\n\nWe watched the other boxes drift away. Bordel wanted to pursue them, certain the town they would pass through wouldn’t bode well, but I was able to convince him that their town guard would be suffice. There’s also a likely chance that they’d have their own set of adventurers ready for a good fight. The bottom line was we needn’t worry ourselves with it and so I suggested we check the factory in the cave that was crafting the boxes. We could make sure it was unable to create those vile things.\n \nThe current plan is to rest up and go back to the cave to see if we could see what came of our party. Part of me worries about Kimaris... but the other really hopes that was the last I’d ever see of him.\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n",

        "text": "What follows is the lore doc for the game I am running, I thought you all might enjoy the adventures of the Storm Crow on here...since we just started. My players were given this after the first session, but you all can enjoy it in chronological order.\n\nIt has been several years since the fall of the Jedi, about a decade from the most accurate count. The Republic was shattered, but it's ghost can still be felt in the galaxy. The first new ships from the new imperial navy have been spotted slowly working their way from the core systems. Out on the rims though, there are entire sections of space that are simply waiting for a response from the Jedi that will never come to fruition. Our children will call this a transition period, in a century they will call it The Begining, and in a millenia they will call it The Age of Strife.\n\nWith republic forces not able to reach into the outer rims of the galaxy, and how slowly the news of the core systems travels, those gangs and corps that know what is going on are stepping in to move their pieces for when the dust settles. Hutt cartels are breaking old alliances for systems that were considered safe, Corporations are acting more bold from the shadows of the Rim, and the newly formed Empire is happy to let the rabble kill themselves so they can hit softer targets when the time is right.\n\nWhat is worse are the border planets—worlds just on the threshold of the core, just outside of standard Imperial Patrols, but within news distance to know what the Empire has claimed the Jedi have done. On some of these planets “Jedi Hunts” are an occurrence. People with a gift for Force Sensitivity are purged from the society: through banishment, or worse. Often times these accusations are never given a full and fair trial, but fear and suspicion are everywhere on these planets—eager to prove their loyalty to the empire.\n\nThere are planets where this isn't the case—safe havens for those that were once to be given a great honor within the academy. They are careful though—they talk of their grievances, but still must watch for the sound of Stormtroopers marching.\n\nYour contact is Essic the Hutt. He is a close friend, or at least he says that. In truth, he has something on all of you, be it a past, a passion, a goal, a regret. The “Storm Crow” is his, not on paper—he doesn't want his name on anything that hot. However the credits that paid for it were his, and more than the cost of an assassination contract, as he reminds all of his investments.\n\nWhich brings us back to the “Storm Crow”: a shelter in the turbulent currents that sweep through the galaxy. How long can a ship like this stay aloft?\n\nEdit: Formatting issue fixed.",

        "text": "EDIT: That moment when I realize I forgot to put in a title...\n\nI recently got into a game called \"Space Station 13\". It's a game about life on a Space Station, except everything goes horrifically wrong. It's a very deep and complex game, with surprising freedom in what you can do. This causes it to be very fun, and usually totally fucking batshit insane. There is a lot of specific terminology and complex game concepts that I now understand, and that I will explain as I go along.\n\nFirst, the game is divided into rounds. At the beginning of a round, everyone is assigned a role, from Medical Doctor to Research Director to Clown or Tourist. Every round spawns one or more \"antagonists\" who are here to make life interesting and difficult for everyone else. They have objectives they must complete, and pretty much free reign as to how they do so. The goal of the station is usually to defeat or survive them.\n\nNow onto the story proper. As this was roughly my second round ever, I decided to play as an assistant (a role with no responsibilities aboard the station) to get used to the controls, and thus Mark Broderson was born, a 73 year old Jeff Bridge Lebowski-esque man with a green pointy goatee and ponytail. I spawned in the station's bar where I walked around a few tables to get used to movement, then picked up a drink and found out how to drink it. That was when I spotted the cake hat (hat shaped like cake. duh.) and decided that today was Mark Broderson's birthday, and he was turning 74.\n\nI announced over radio that today was my birthday, and that I was hosting a large birthday party in the bar, so we could all celebrate together, but it went all but unnoticed as at about the same time, a blob was reported on the station.\n\nFor those who don't know, a blob is a player-controlled structure entity whose goal is to consume the station. They can be one of the most difficult gamemodes, as the blob can be very very thought to kill played right. So everyone on the station lost their minds.\n\nOf course, as a new player, I didn't have the faintest idea what was going on, so I just stayed at the bar taking shots of bourbon and wondering why nobody was showing up to my birthday party, and what all the yelling over the radio was about.\n\nEventually, someone did cometo the birthday party. His name was Pancho Hernandez. When he learned that it was my birthday, he immediately sat down and started drinking with me to celebrate this important day.\n\nWithin minutes, we were both completely shitfaced. While the station was fighting an unspeakable biological horror, I was chugging from a beer bottle with Pancho's drunken encouragement. When station managed to defeat the blob, I was picking a drunk fight with a guy who'd bumped into me as he was fighting the legitimate threat to the station. When the admins decided to keep the round going and spawn more antagonists, I was yelling my shitfaced appreciation of the bartender's guitar playing skills.\n\nEventually, the new antagonists must have really fucked up the station somehow because the emergency escape shuttle was called. What you need to know about this thing is that, when station really goes tits-up, the shuttle is called to evacuate everyone.\n\nMe and Pancho were kinda worried about this turn of events, but decided that within the 10 minutes it'd take the shuttle to arrive, we could get a few more drinks in, which turned out to be a rather poor idea as we realized when we tried making our way to the shuttle bay. We were so utterly wasted we could hardly put one foot in front of the other, much less walk straight, which would be a problem to get in through the teeny doors.\n\nKeep in mind everyone was still going apeshit in the station. As we were drunkenly stumbling our way to the bay, Everyone was yelling about the changeling (evil shapeshifter alien thing) on the station. As we were discussing whether soda could serve as a stand-in for water to dilute the alcohol in the bloodstream, slurring our words the whole time, more people were stuttering their final words over our comm units. As we were debating which of the two was less shitfaced to drag the other into the shuttle when it docked, we could hear gunfire down the hall.\n\nWhen the shuttle docked, I dragged pancho in, and we both buckled into our seat, and that's when shit really hit the fan. The shuttle, as it happens at the end of the round while everyone is dying, when everyone is stressed out, and where anyone might be a bad guy in disguise, tends to get very chaotic very fast.\n\nWithin seconds of our buckling in, the slaughter had started. Security officers shooting at people, civilians whacking each other with makeshift weapons, agitated psychos running around the place generally making a mess, and two drunk dudes sitting quietly side by side, taking it all in and having a semi-philosophical discussion about the nature of being drunk.\n\nIn the end, we were 2 of the 5 or so survivors on that shuttle, and the entire 48-ish strong station. The ones who'd made it this far had been the best of the best, the elite, the most robust of fighters or astute of nerds. Oh, and those two drunk fellas in the corned who haven't really moved since we left.\n\nAll in all, this was a very good introduction to the madness that is Space Station 13. You can do anything, be anything, and this includes throwing shitfaced birthday parties. I have a few more stories, but this is by far the most fun, chaotic, and SS13-esque. Never change, you psychotic bastards, you're the ones who add \"laughter\" in \"manslaughter\"!",

        "text": "So. I'm running a home-brew superhero game, and a new character made by a new player was just starting out. To put things in perspective for you, his last character was a speedster who got paralyzed and arrested for raping everyone in four city blocks in under two minutes. He creates a new guy, Toxic. Toxic has this [power](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Poison_Manipulation) and everyone starts out with 10,000 dollars. After he confused my saying of \"bucks\" for money as actual deers he decided to create and ride a toxic deer out of his window shattering his arm. A nearby police officer offers to help him, but Toxic refuses and hands the man a 25$ giftcard to wall mart. Anyways, he gets back on his deer, and rides it to Chipotle. Everyone flips out, since his arm is graphically broken and a few people call 911. He ignores this and tries to get his deer to buy a taco, but the deer can't speak so it and the server just stare at each other awkwardly. Eventually he ordered it himself, and while walking out with his deer, he was stopped by EMT's who pleaded with him to get into the ambulance. Knowing the costs he refused, and shoved a taco in the man's face demanding he take it for his kindness. So, while he was riding his deer around, I decided to spice things up and throw a villain at him. It's this cheesy flamethrower guy named like Dr. Hotfire or something, and he goes apeshit on a jewelry store stealing everything and burning the place. Toxic, upon seeing this chucks his tacos at the man's head. Rolls a 19 and an 18. Two headshots. Enraged, the the good Dr. burns the deer into ashes, and sets Toxic ablaze. Toxic stop drops and rolls before shooting Hotfire in the face with a poison burrito, killing him instantly. So, now that he's finished, I ask the player what he want's to do, and remind him he is still a little bit on fire.  He grins, and says he wants to remake his deer and perform surgery on his arm.\n\n\"Your character isn't a doctor. You could die.\"\n\n\"Don't worry my deer and I are medically trained.\" \n\n\"No your not.\"\n\n\"Shush bebby. Don't squish my dreams.\"\n\nSo, in broad daylight in the middle of a burning street next to the man he just killed while still on fire, he lays down and operates on himself.\n\n20.\n\n19.\n\n20.\n\nFuck.\n\nHe puts his bones back together, before creating a toxic cast and extinguishing the flames. \n\n\"I Doctor now. I killed Doctor I become Doctor. But not just a mere Doctor, I am highly trained! I am Surgeon!\"\n\nSo that's how we got a medic who creates and manipulates Anthrax tacos.",

        "text": "I had only just started learning D&amp;D and all its rules. I thought it would be great to rope my brother and my cousin into playing.\nI was so wrong\nMy brother made the most plain halfing character ever called 'Jesus'. My cousin created the ultimate in Mary Sues immediately due to me adding some stuff into the game. Called himself 'Percy Dragon'. So he was a half-god dragonborn with massively overpowered buffs. I actually had to limit him as he was blowing through my test runs.\n\nAnyway, I decided to start with the basic story from the starter kit, just to get an idea of how to play. The INSTANT the players had control, my cousin immediately attempted to kill my brother. He takes a few shots with his bow but misses most of them. My brother dives underneath the wagon they are dueling on. Percy then starts swinging his sword underneath the wagon, and clips Jesus, causing him to start bleeding.\n\nJesus uses an arrowhead to dig through the bottom of the wagon into the wagon's goods. Percy notices this, but by the time he gets back onto the wagon, Jesus had ran down the road, covered in flour, oil and his own blood. He then, for no reason, spots two dead horses nearby and throws his sword at one. He then wanted to light himself on fire and roll towards Percy.\n\nSo while these two are dicking around, I decided to finally add the goblin encounter. However, the goblins are such terrible shots, one of the goblins shoots the other ones by accident, resulting in a giant fight between them. Jesus then decides to kick up some dust clouds to blind Percy to hide and it works. Jesus runs and hides in the gutted corpse of one of the horses. He then rips off the horses head from inside and disguises himself as a foal.\nThis works too.\n\nPercy sees through this ridiculous scheme and continues shooting and even calls down his daily lightning bolt ability. Somehow Jesus just wouldn't die. Jesus then attempted to intimidate the dead horse and rolls his only 20 of the game. The horse is so intimidated that it comes back to life as a zombie horse. He prepares to ride away, but Percy is having none of it. He snipes Jesus right through the chest killing him. The zombie horse then eats Jesus, which transfers his soul into the horse.\nJesus has become a zombie horse.\n\nI ended the game there as I was tired and neither players would attempt to do anything other than murder each other.",

        "text": "Whipping through space like a greased superball, there is a planet. A planet called Vigas.  Vigas is a weird planet. There are many strange creatures on it, [going about their weird lives, finding interesting ways to blow themselves into tiny pieces](https://redd.it/446cyc). There are gods, monsters, magic, and various other oddities. But perhaps the oddest and most implausible thing about Vigas is its friendly neighbor, which would be called a moon if it wasn't so small and low-orbiting. No, this little bit of space junk is called a Comet. And to the world of Vigas, it has a particular name. They call it the Rainy Comet. Why? Because, every day on that little ball of impossible rock, it rains. Every day, every hour, every minute, it rains. And where there is stone and water, life is soon to follow.\n\nHundreds of years after its appearance, the Rainy Comet is now inhabited by many of the same creatures that walk the surface of Vigas. Humans, elves, dwarves, the standard fantasy fare. But there are things here even stranger than you might expect. Imagine a camera, up at the top of the comet, furthest from the planet below. Here, the rain crashes down without end. Now watch as the camera tracks downward, over rolling hills, then steep slopes, then cliffs, and finally, down near the bottom, where the gravity of the world below perpetually pulls the water off the comet and sends it spiraling into the atmosphere. This upside-down place, this little patch of precarious vertigo, is home to a forest- a forest that grows up and out, in order to catch the water falling off the tiny world. This is where our story begins.\n\nLing Ling the [monkey girl](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-vanaras) had just lost her hunting partner. He had become too bold in his pursuit, lost his footing, and fallen out of the forest. And off the comet. It was a hard blow to the young Ling Ling, who was only a novice ranger herself. In her distress, she wandered the town and idly threw some old garbage into the forest village's living trash compactor: A curious green [slime](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJCRFJ7knoLfRlwjwoWQwEJ77MEr9c_wQj2SYRoBFAA/edit?usp=sharing) that enjoyed free meals. In a nearby dump, a [suit of armor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLDBogqbiaQTDf3AZ3UJAMBoNMr0Gzklq-g55d9I8Ks/edit?usp=sharing) was being worked on by unseen hands, and with a flash of magic, it began to shudder and rise, clutching a wicked axe in its empty metal gauntlets. It had only two purposes in its life: To kill the man named \"Lawrence\", and to kill a certain archmage. Finally, only a little bit further along, a bedraggled human was staggering into a bar, intending to get very drunk indeed.\n\nBut this is where the curious mysticism ends, and the chucklefuckery begins.\n\nSee, the man in the bar was a brawler, who had a drinking problem and a fiery temper. He was meant to be a monk, except that he proved too undisciplined to be properly trained. And right now, he was perched on a bar stool, screaming racial slurs at the Vanara bartender, punching anyone who got close, and demanding free drinks.\n\nWe shall call this man Fucktard.\n\nFucktard was not a popular guy. Between the screaming, rampant violence, slurs, threats, and damn near everything else about him, most folks found him... disagreeable. So, when an animate suit of armor burst through the front doors and demanded to know where \"Lawrence\" was, one of the bar patrons informed the rather intimidating armor that Fucktard's real name was, in fact, Lawrence. The armor marched up, threateningly asked Fucktard what his name was. Well, it sure as fuck wasn't Lawrence. In fact, that smug shit-slinger in the back, I think his name was Lawrence. Let's fucking kill him.\n\nSo, the murderous suit of armor and the drunken Fucktard proceed to chase the poor sap down, smack him with an axe, and while he's dying and bleeding out, Fucktard heaves himself up onto the roof of a building, screams something incoherent, and elbow-drops the helpless fucker into an ugly beer-soaked puddle. Then, Fucktard gets up, dusts himself off in full view of half the goddamn town, and goes back into the bar. After committing cold-blooded murder on a helpless man in broad daylight.\n\nThe bar was a bit emptier when Fucktard went back in. Even the murderous suit of armor was hesitant to go in there. So, while all the townspeople ominously grab their bows and start alerting the guards, the Armor just sort of stands around while Fucktard gets drunk and spills booze everywhere. By this point, Ling Ling and the slime are both alerted to this crisis in progress, and proceed to handle it by lying in ambush and devouring the body of the dead bar patron from earlier. I'll let you figure out who did which. Anyway, by this point, Fucktard finally gets it through his empty skull that he's in a bad situation, in an abandoned bar surrounded by dozens of angry townspeople weilding bows. So his immediate response is to cover everything in the bar with flammable booze, light a torch, and loudly hold the place hostage.\n\n&gt; TOWNSPERSON: \"There's nobody IN there. Let's just set it on fire ourselves and shoot the hell out of him when he comes out. We can rebuild.\"\n\n&gt; Ling Ling: \"Fuck this, I shoot the crazed idiot in the head with a blunt arrow. Nonlethal damage.\"\n\n&gt; Fucktard: \"Augh, who the fuck did that!? I open the door, torch in hand, and scream: This is your final warning! BACK OFF OR I SET THE BAR ON FIRE!\"\n\n&gt; Townspeople: ***POINTING OVER A DOZEN ARROWS DIRECTLY AT FUCKTARD'S FACE***\n\n&gt; Fucktard: \"This is not going as I had planned. I drop the torch and leap out the window!\"\n\n&gt; DM: \"Yeah, guess what, they were expecting that and they all get one attack off as you dive for the window.\"\n\nAnd that's how Fucktard became a gurgling pincushion, dying and bleeding out in the burning bar. Luckily for him, the Armor charged through the door to \"rescue\" fucktard, heaved him out the window, and presented him triumphantly to the nearest authority figure he could find: Ling Ling, and the slime following her around.\n\n&gt; Armor: \"I am Mister Nibbit, and I have apprehended this man for you.\"\n\n&gt; Ling Ling: \"That racist prick who killed a man in broad daylight, insulted my town and tried to burn down a building? Fuck him. Just feed him to the slime. I have to go put out the fire!\"\n\nSo Mister Nibbit shrugged, heaved the mortally wounded Fucktard onto the slime, and dusted his hands. But the slime wasn't so sure about this situation. After all Fucktard had technically fed him, so it wouldn't do to just let someone like that die, right? The slime pondered this as it dissolved Fucktard's shoes, and finally it came to a decision.\n\nSo the slime brought the now 1-hit-point-from-dying Fucktard to the townspeople who had just filled him with arrows.\n\n&gt; Townsfolk: \"The idiot is still alive? Maybe we should turn him over to the guard and put him on trial.\" \n\n&gt; DM: *rolls*\n\n&gt; Townsoflk: \"Or, how about we don't waste any more time or energy on this dipshit? Let's just finish the job right here. He died in the hostage situation in the bar. Investigation over, we move on with our lives.\"\n\n&gt; DM: \"Fucktard, as the townsman draws back an arrow, you see a hazy image of the grim reaper standing over you, its scythe readied. You hear him mutter to himself, 'This has got to be the most idiotic way i've ever seen anyone die, ever.'\"\n\n&gt; Fucktard: \"I call him a bitch.\"\n\n&gt; DM: \"...Yeah you do. The reaper swings his scythe down between your eyes as the townsman fires his arrow, and the world goes black. Now, roll a new character, and if it's Fucktard again, I will personally throw you out of this campaign and ban you from ever playing again.\"\n\nThus ended the legacy of Fucktard. In his wake, the town learned an important lesson. That is, keeping bows around in order to shoot racists in the face is an excellent idea. As for the guard, they arrived, put out the fire, gathered up all the players, and had a little informal hearing about what the hell just happened. It was discovered that Ling Ling had acted responsibly, attempting to pacify Fucktard before things got ugly, and had helped coordinate the efforts to put out the fire. Mister Nibbit (the armor) was deemed dangerous, but manageable, and was assigned to Ling Ling's care. And finally, the Slime, who hadn't really done much of anything other than eat a few bodies and shoes, was given a similar treatment- Ling Ling was to make sure it didn't do anything stupid or eat anything important.\n\n&gt; Ling Ling: \"You mean my reward for dealing with this to be saddled with babysitting two incredibly dangerous sociopaths? I'm only sixteen! I'm still a novice!\"\n\n&gt; Guard: \"We feel that you'll rise to the occasion. Besides, it's not really babysitting. More like being a mom.\"\n\n&gt; Ling Ling: \"What.\"\n\n&gt; Nibbit: \"MOTHEERRRRRRRR\"\n\n&gt; Slime: \"I burble affectionately.\"\n\n&gt; Ling Ling: \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\nGood times abounded.\n\n[Join us next time as Ling Ling and her two merry murder-brats go on their first mission: Slaughtering a bunch of elves, because fuck elves!](https://redd.it/48jeer)",

        "text": " **THE PARTY** \n\n* A fairly standard Half-Elven wizard who has taken a dip into cleric (this is the oldest character, has survived a grand total of three party near TPKs in this relatively new campaign.) \n* A Changeling rogue, an agent of a mysterious, artifact hunting organization called \"The Mask\" (his last three characters have all been members of \"The Mask\".) \n* An Earth Genasi fighter/gladiator (the newest member of the party, this is his 3rd session.) \n* A smooth talking, con man of a Human warlock (my character, total skill monkey.) \n\n**THE CAMPAIGN** \n\nSo, three or four sessions ago, our party was investigating a small chapel in the middle of nowhere, inside we found a coffin, the meddling rogue touched the coffin, the coffin turned into a portal into god knows where, we fell through the portal, ghosts waiting on the other side fuck up our shit, TPK. The DM, being a cool guy, and recognizing that we'd been dealing with a lot of character death recently (This was my third character in this campaign,) offered us a choice, reroll, or keep our character, as our next session would take place outside the material world. All of us except our Minotaur war cleric decided to keep our characters, and thus Grathix Thunderhoof was accepted into the halls of bovine Valhalla, and Onyx Coldshard was born, but that's unimportant. \n\n**THE STORY** \n\nSo, we are three sessions in to this afterlife sidequest we've been going through (Onyx died at a similar time as us in his backstory, and met up with us in the great beyond), and it is following somewhat of a pattern. We awaken, fully rested, in a room that is either entirely white, black, or red, with stars dotting around us, as if the walls and floor were invisible and the room was suspended in deep space. In this room will be one, powerful enemy. Some much easier than others. Whether we die, or conquer the creature doesn't seem to matter, regardless of the outcome we just wake up in the next room, fully rested. The room we most recently awoke in was red, with stars, and contained a fleshy tentacle beast. We slaughtered the beast, I requisitioned its hide for a cloak, rolled a 17 to make cloak, GM told me I look like [this](https://news.artnet.com/wp-content/news-upload/2014/08/flesh-chicken-suit-art-1.jpg) now but with a purplish tint, all is well in the universe. Further in the dungeon our rogue and wizard encounter another apparition. I didn't get a good look before it decided to possess our wizard. I came up on the Wizard preparing to attack our party, so I charmed it with Fey presence, and comforted the half ghost, half Half Elf, by swaddling it, and feeding it one of my snake oil elixirs (Dr. Tizz Kimble's Amazing Elixir, Healing Tincture, Miracle Cure, Magical Antidote, and More!™, only 90 GP for a bottle.) which healed him for a maximum of three HP. A broken grapple here, a well placed shortbow shot there, and our possessed wizard is pinned to the ground via an arrow through his foot. I knock him into negatives using my crossbow and the ghost shows itself. An idea begins to brew in my head. \n\nI whisper the DM, and make some rolls to find out some information. First, a history roll to see if I know anything about Ghost sexuality and mating rituals, if such a thing even exists. Roll a 17. DM makes a hidden roll, chuckles, and says roll religion. Unnatural 20. DM chuckles some more and tells me I know vaguely of such tendencies among ghosts. I ask to roll perception to check the Ghosts gender and he just tells me it's a female ghost. I use minor illusion to create a hunky male ghost, attempting to distract our ghastly assailant. DM says roll charisma. Unnatural 24. Female ghost is now intrigued by the illusion, and burns it's turn investigating. Fails the roll and does not detect the illusion. On my next turn I use prestidigitation to make the room smell like vanilla, and make [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-w6ND5PZxA) music play in the background. (I know I bent the rules a bit, but the DM was cool with it as it wasn't major, and he runs pretty liberally with the rule of cool.) I beat one more CHA contest against the ghost before the DM says I've sufficiently charmed the actual ghost, and now I only have to worry about the ghost's investigation checks to detect the illusion. Me and the gladiator spent the next couple of turns attacking the ghost as it crit failed, literally, every single one of its investigation checks, too enamored by the rippling mass of misty muscle in front of it to attack either of us. On my second to last turn I prestidigitated a phantasmal condom and tossed it between the two. Next turn I killed the actual ghost with a hearty Eldritch Blast. I dissipated my illusion by giving it a high five.",

It’s enough to note that my stomach continues to churn nervously. Nothing has happened yet, but I still can’t help but suspect.\n\nI had an opportunity to run, to abandon the task at hand this morning. I’m likely to regret that lost opportunity. When I woke up, Kimaris was gone. I dressed, brushed my hair, braided and pinned it in place, washed my face, and ate a meager breakfast before heading back to the stables. I had thought about not showing up considering my companion wasn’t there to enforce me. Yet I felt obligated. I hadn’t said I wouldn’t help and am too much a woman of my word. A bitter habit (now) that my mother instilled in me.\n\nUpon arriving, Bordel greeted the lot of us. Shortly after, almost as though he had always been there, Kimaris appeared. In tow with him were some folk who possibly were a type of guard. Bordel called to them to which they mentioned having a problem with my acquaintance.\n\n“He had slept at the temple of Helms. We need to know if he is affiliated with them.”\n\n“When is that a crime?” I asked. The men gave a smirk and replied, “The Sacred Flame is the only way.”\n\n“If that’s so, then why do you have a temple established for that religion?” I questioned.\n\n“Well, we do not own this town-” they began to explain, but I cut them.\n\n“Then you don’t rule over the people who choose to worship there!” I snapped. It was infuriating seeing these men trying to come and bully my companion.\n\nThe men looked at each other, clearly not thrilled by my reproach. “We’ll let you off with a warning this time,” they said before turning on their heels and leaving without another word. \n\nI shook my head before looking to the group and asking, “Are we to go then?”\n\nWithin the city walls, we ran into two folk who seemed to know of what Bordel was attempting to accomplish. One was a beggar man while the other was a Gnome. We were passing through the market on our way to the city gates when the beggar stopped us. I had only caught mention of ‘the task you are faced with’ when I began to look about the market. The feeling of wanting to run crept back up and I had hoped to spot something I could disappear to. Yet I knew my desire to leave was my impatience in standing around wasting time.\n\nWhen we did get going, we only managed to approach the city gates when a Gnome caught our attention. Her name was Gizmo and she seemed to know quite a lot about the cup herself.  I was beginning to think we ought to just hand it off to her to dispose of when she began to mention how there were ten cups total. From there the Gnome explained how all ten cups together granted the collector a single wish. Some eyes lit up at that notion, but Bordel’s remained unmoved. \n\n“But mind you, that is far too much power for any one person to ever have. No one should ever have all the cups,” Gizmo added. I could agreed with her. If the forces of evil, like she had suggested, were to obtain all ten, then that wish made could be disastrous! But just because my own inclinations are of the good variety, it hardly seems fair that those of my similar interest make such a wish for it, too, would infringe upon someone.\n\nAs I pondered, I heard the Gnome mention that her God, Bahamut, was collecting the cups for safe keeping.\n\n“But... you just said no one person should ever have all of them.”\n\n“Indeed you are correct, but Bahamut has no plans to use them,” Gizmo responded.\n\n“That may be, but who’s to say your God is honest?” I debated. Looks all around were thrown as I challenged her Deity, but I rushed on before any remarks could be made, “And even if He is honest and benevolent as you believe, what’s to prevent them from being stolen by some other supreme being?”\n\n“Oh, I assure you child that Bahamut’s vaults are well secured.”\n\n“Then might you be able to take us to Him?” Bordel asked.\n\n“Well, I certainly can try. If we head East, there’s a good chance we will find Him.”\n\nI held my tongue, not wanting to debate. It was pointless and for all I cared, I wanted to get along peacefully. Nothing worse in a caravan than that one person who complained or bickered every chance they got.\n\nTonight I assisted Fernwood with camp preparations. Her wagon was well equipped for a long journey. She made a fine meal with her wares and was kind to share it with all of us. And before we knew it, watches were delegated and bed rolls laid. In another hour I’ll be able to rest myself for I took the first watch.",

        "text": "So, once more I return to the bowels of Reddit to address my party of fools. Yesterday we had a session. It went well enough, the super bowl was going on at the same time so we were all a bit distracted. Anyways, the party had gotten into a boss battle in a room full of skeleton kings, all of which are powerful enemies. The main damage dealers for the party are absent for the session, so the group is having a tough time of it. As the battle progresses, the rogue gets the ever loving shit best out of him. First he gets impaled by a double crit, then he gets pounded. He's bleeding out. In desperation. The wizard turns him into a small drain, getting him temporary hit points, which he immediately loses. (Also, the monk got a concussion again.) Once more the rogue is bleeding out. \n\nNote comes the question. Whilst deciding since actions for the skeletons, I suddenly overhear the cleric and the wizard debating how to best give the rogue a healing potion. The cleric proposes that he put the potion in the rogue asshole, since you get more drunk when you drink through your ass. (I'm not sure if this is true, can anyone confirm?) The wizard agrees and adds the exchange of taking cocaine through your ass. I'm just now looking up, and they both turn to me. I tell them to continue, I want to hear this. And so they do. They debate whether healing options take effect in the esophagus or the intestines, whether the kidney could filter the potion, and whether potions need to be applied directly to the wound. \n\nThe rogue perks up and says \"I don't care, just heal me!\" Followed by \"I'm feminine today, mentally, physically *rolls d20 gets 6* I'm female and * rolls d20 gets 19* very promiscuous! So yeah, I'd love a potion up the butt ;)\"\n\nI ended up declining the analgesic use of the potion, but I want to know what you all think, so I could potentially implement it in later sessions.",

        "text": "Hello again! Today we will be continuing the panic-inducing adventures of Hautangi, Nellie, Poindexter and Leilani. These poor Kiwi souls have suffered kidnappings, been wrongly accused of terrorist activities and endured the ravages of being isolated with people that you despise. You can read about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/43nt8s/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_2/. Strap yourselves in for a whirlwind escape from their Hate-Den of Solitude...in the van of the man who put them there. \n\nAlright, so things were significantly less exciting than that. There were no high-speed pursuits, no raging gun battles as they sped through the lush New Zealand scenery. Instead, the group entered the vehicle and met Chrissy. Chrissy was a young woman with a particularly extraordinary set of talents: She could mask not only her own aura, but those of anyone that she was with. This was something of a boon for us, as magic was one of the sure-fire methods of locating us. Not that any of our ignorant civilians knew this but the players had been just a little bit nervous about being found with our drawers down (and war-paint on, so to speak).\n\nThe introduction went thusly: Ghost got in the van, strapped in and waited impatiently for the rest of us to embark. We did, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, before staring at the dwarf sitting cross-legged in the passenger seat. Her eyes were shut tightly in concentration and their was an almost imperceptible hum emanating from her mouth. Leilani, in a burst of uncharacteristic anger, politely inquired as to her identity.\n\n\"Who the fuck are you?! Ghost, who the fuck is this?!\" The driver chuckled quietly, gently pulling away from the Isolation Cave. \n\n\"Gang, meet Chrissy. Chrissy, meet the new meat.\" There was no response from the seemingly comatose girl, save for a slight twitch at the introduction. \n\n\"Why the fuck is she here?\" Even Hautangi was taken aback at the sheer rage seething forth from Leilani. Ghost quirked an eyebrow in the rear view mirror, taking the van down a winding dirt path. \n\n\"Chrissy makes sure that we aren't caught with magic. You lot left plenty of biological material lying around, so the A.I.U can use that to find you astrally.\" The Awakened Investigation Unit was something of a sore point for the people of New Zealand. While they were a necessity due to the propensity of magical crime, the organization operated like a cross between the Gestapo and the X-Men. A confrontation with this group would not have ended well for anyone and the team knew it. Seemingly accepting of this answer, everyone settled in for a long ride. Leilani was the exception to this, murmuring angrily under her breath.\n\nTheir journey included lots of back roads, dirt trails and more than one off-road adventure. It was...actually, it was all sort of relaxing. The group had been forced through something of a crucible, trauma after trauma befalling them. Now that they were out in the open, it was nice to enjoy the relatively peaceful trip. Sadly, all good things must come to an end and this had been a very good thing. It's conclusion came about, naturally, when they reached their destination: A large, reclusive barn in the middle of a large farm. The reluctant friends/incidental allies felt a pit form in their stomachs. \n\n\"Did you take us out of that tiny fucking cave so you could put us in a bigger fucking cave!?\" Leilani exploded in fury, the anger that had been quietly simmering beneath the surface now surging forward with righteous wrath. Ghost laughed openly, bringing his hat down to hide his face.\n\n\"Pretty much, yeah. Head on in, we'll get you sorted.\" Leilani stalked over to him, stopping just shy of actually touching him. \n\n\"You're goddamn crazy if you think we're going in there!\" He shrugged, leaning against the van door.\n\n\"You either head inside or you fuck off, try to make it on your own. You think all of this shit came free? You think someone just decided to think the best of you and try to save your asses because 'it was the right thing to do'?\" He looked at her with a neutral expression. \"Time to start earning your keep. What's it gonna be?\" Ghost looked from the irked veterinarian to her erstwhile 'friends'. \"You want to make a run for it?\" \n\nHautangi snorted derisively, wandering past the large wooden doors. Poindexter followed slowly, feet shuffling across the earth. Nellie put a hand on Leilani's shoulder, gently guiding her to the barn. Ghost shook his head, smiling at their antics. Dusting off his hat, the enigmatic fellow followed after rapping on the side of the van. Having received the signal, Chrissy promptly passed out in her seat; the strain of concealing four astral signatures finally taking it's toll on her. \n\nContrasting with the barn's rustic aesthetic, the interior was an odd combination of creature comforts and spartan necessity. They each had an actual bed, partitioned off from the others by a privacy curtain, and there was a proper shower in one corner of the structure. A kitchenette, small dining area and a Trid projector all occupied space inside. The most striking feature, and the one that caught everyone's eye, was the glimmering crystal circle floating close to the roof. Past all of the support beams, this strange disc managed to be both creepy and impressive. Blunt as ever, it was Hautangi who asked what it was.\n\n\"Ghost, what the fuck is that?\" The man in question gazed upwards before looking at the mighty Maori. \n\n\"Same thing Chrissy does, except we can't take that one with us.\" Nellie gaped, her corporate knowledge shining through the haze of helplessness. \n\n\"Something like that is worth a fortune! Easily more than any of us have ever handled. Don't!\" She directed the final at Hautangi, already painfully familiar with his deep-seated love of dirty jokes. Miffed at a missed oppurtunity, the hustler crossed his arms and frowned.\n\n\"Who would waste it on us then? How does that make sense?\" Ghost wandered past them, idly wiping some dirt off of a table.\n\n\"Good question. Better one would be why but you'll get there eventually.\" Reaching into his worn coat, their 'savior' produced a sheet of paper and a single pen. Ghost placed them on the table top and started to walk away, heading for the door. \"Write me a list of things you want. Useful things, educational even. Anything you can think of that might improve your chances of not dying horribly on your first job.\" His nonchalant tone threw them for a loop, none of them really understanding what he had said until he was standing outside. \n\n\"Wait, what? What job?\" \n\n\"Why are we dying!??\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" \n\nThe cacophony of questions was silenced by a raised hand and a cleared throat. Ghost watched them impassively, waiting for complete quiet before answering. \n\n\"Like I said, this shit doesn't come free. Someone, somewhere, decided to pull your asses out of the frying pan. First rule of what we do: Nothing comes free. Time to start paying off your debt.\" Ghost reached behind the door, fiddling with something. No-one but Nellie heard the faint hum in the air. The mercenary sighed, looking back at the confused group with an expression resembling pity. \"Look, just make your list and get settled in. You're going to be here for a while. I'll be back in a few days. Try not to kill each other in the meantime.\" Ghost started dragging the doors shut, silhouetted by the burning orange sun slowly drifting past the horizon behind him. \n\n\"No promises, Ghost. Fucking hurry back, yeah?\" Hautangi called out, his irascible nature shining through. It earned a short bark of laughter from their hesitantly titled 'friend'. A fluorescent bulb sprang to life inside the barn as the door shut, bathing everyone in an almost painfully bright light. The rag-tag collection of miscreants stared around the barn and then at each other. It was Poindexter who broke the silence, a nervous laughter bubbling forth from his lips. The others looked at him incredulously, probably believing that he had finally cracked for good. The flabby cabby gestured around wildly, his hysterical cackling growing louder and louder. It was almost cinematic how quickly his mirth spread. Soon enough, even Leilani was howling with laughter, her sides hurting from the force of it. \n\nAfter their impromptu giggle-fest, the group got to work with the important things. Leilani checked their food supplies and was pleasantly surprised to find that they had been left with more than just soy this time; krill and synthetic meats littered their refrigerator. Hautangi tested the firmness of the couch, parking his sizable posterior firmly on a surprisingly comfortable cushion. Poindexter began an experimental log of bed plushness, though his records ended when he quickly dozed off. Nellie promptly disappeared inside the confines of the shower and did not emerge until her skin was free of make-shift tribal paint. The group added to the list in between sleeping, showering and watching the few flicks that they had been granted.\n\nThey passed the time with idle chit-chat, trying to learn more about these people that they were stuck with. While the basics came easy enough, no-one wanted to spill the beans about their more intimate details. Conversation quickly turned to the situation at hand or laughing at the terrible trid plots. Two discoveries were made: Poindexter and Hautangi were starting to feel the effects of alcohol withdrawal, having not gone without a drink for so long before. The conman was having an easier time of things, his addiction not as severe as his flabby friend's. While Poindexter steadily deteriorated, Leilani was coming to grips with her own revelation. She had been awoken in the middle of the night by a strange, rhythmic thumping. Having scuttled around trying to identify the source, it took her some time before she realized that it was her. Specifically, it was her hearts. Plural. Though panicked, Leilani made the decision to keep knowledge about her newly acquired samba-maker to herself. It must have happened during her melting-girl phase and it might be contributing to her current hair-trigger temper. Either way, it was her body and her decision to keep it quiet. \n\nTrue to his word, Ghost returned three days later. He appeared with several bags, each containing some clothes for the barn folk. Grateful for the new attire, the group presented him with their list: A vague collection of exercise equipment, educational programs and trideo films that would help pass the time. Other small items included a make-up kit for Nellie and alcohol, something that appeared multiple times on an otherwise short list. Ghost read it and looked at the group. Leilani was torn between amusement and irritation, glaring at the other three. Nellie smiled beatifically, hands clasped innocently behind her back, while Hautangi smirked. Poindexter sort of gurgled, his lack of alcohol finally taking a physical toll on him. Sweat poured off of him in rivulets, his breath coming in shallow bursts.\n\n\"The taxi-driver okay?\" Ghost seemed genuinely concerned, pocketing the paper. Leilani glared at him, her easily roused anger reappearing. \n\n\"He might be if someone hadn't locked him away, cutting him off from the thing he's addicted to. Ass.\" \nThe runner did a double-take.\n\n\"Ben's an addict?\" Her fist clenched, Leilani forced herself to breath through the thin red veil that steadily thickening. \n\n\"He likes the booze, mate. A little too much, you know what I'm saying? Poor bastard might die without it.\" Hautangi was laying it on thick, desperate for something alcoholic to drink. Leilani punched him in the arm, her self-control straining against her vexation. Ghost watched on, more than a little confused.\n\n\"Alright then. Just...keep him hydrated, I guess. I'll see what I can do.\" With that incredibly unhelpful statement, Ghost fled the barn once more. The group turned to Poindexter as one, watching the pathetic mass of blubber quiver in pain. \n\n\"Man, that's really pathetic. Kind of sad.\" Leilani took over, ignoring Hautangi as she did so. They pumped Benjamin full of water and made sure that he had a little food before sending him to bed. He was stirred from his fitful slumber in the middle of the night by someone shaking him. Predictably, it was Hautangi. Unpredictably, he wanted to break out and raid the nearby farmhouse for some booze. His body aching at the thought of precious alcohol, Poindexter agreed. The booze-thirsty pair clumsily tip-toed past the sleeping women and to the door. They discovered that it was unlocked, the wooden doors sliding open with minimal effort. Hautangi performed a quick scan of the perimeter before skulking out of the barn, intent on remaining hidden. \n\nHis attempts were somewhat ruined when his body seized up, electricity crackling through his substantial frame. Hautangi hit the floor with a dull thud, still twitching idly. Ben stared at him in horror, the events unfolding before him enough to put him off. He turned to head back inside before stopping. He and Ghost locked eyes before Poindexter suffered the same fate, convulsing wildly on the floor. Ghost laughed quietly to himself, detaching the taser prongs from his weapon once it was clear that they were both unconscious. The pair awoke back inside the barn with an enraged Leilani standing over them and a note attached to Hautangi's forehead: 'Don't do it again.' \n\n\"Fuck that noise. The fucker can't be there every night.\" True to form, Hautangi ignored every threat or plea from the others and tried to sneak out once more. He was correct, after a fashion, in that Ghost was not waiting for him this time. Instead, Hautangi stumbled across a series of electrified grates on the ground, each activated by pressure plates hidden beneath the dirt. Desperate though he was for even a drop of liquor, the Maori hustler decided against further attempts. His choice was aided by the stinging sensation that the electrical burns left on his skin, a reminder that Ghost was a nasty bastard. \n\nWhen the man in question returned, it was with a van full of goodies. He backed the van up to the barn doors and had the team unload everything inside. Exercise equipment, several Augmented Reality training programs and a single six-pack of beer. Hautangi hollered in joy, reaching for it when Ghost calmly informed him that the alcohol was off-limits until everything was unloaded. Poindexter, despite his near infirmity, rushed to finish up with the clumsy fervor of a desperate man. Between the four of them, the van was emptied within minutes. Ghost passed out the ice-cold beverages and settled down at the table. Once everyone had finished their beer, and moved on to a second in some cases, he started talking. \n\n\"This is everything that you asked for, within reason. You've got two weeks to make the best of it. After that, you've got a job.\" Everyone watched, both cautious and intrigued. Ghost plugged a small data chip into the trideo projector and leaned back as green light erupted into existence. The holographic device displayed pictures of a woman, complete with multiple angles. \n\n\"This is Dr Samantha Hirsch. She's a leading specialist in plastic-surgery and reconstructive procedures. She's also recently had someone put a hit out on her.\" Ghost smiled, tipping his hat towards the group. \"Not that she knows it. That's where you lot come in.\" Nellie nodded, taking extensive notes. She had already done some questionable things for the sake of her company. This was hardly going to be worse. Hautangi was well acquainted with violence, though murder was a line that even he had not yet crossed. Poindexter was caught up in the rush of alcohol flowing through him, ignorant to everything around him. Leilani...\n\n\"You're out of your goddamn mind if you think I'm going to kill for you! We've been kidnapped, drugged, stuffed in a cave for a month and then shoved in a barn somewhere between 'Nowhere' and 'Fucking Nowhere'. This shit's gone on long enough!\" Leilani's fury surged forth, filling her veins with an ambrosia of adrenaline and wrath. Her fingers had clenched into fists, the skin around them turning pale from the pressure. It seemed like she would leap across the table and choke their handler to death with his own hat. What none of them expected was for Ghost to scowl at her.\n\n\"Sit down, you bloody drama queen. You're not going to kill her. You're meant to warn her that the hit's coming without drawing any attention.\" All of Leilani's anger drained out of her quickly, leaving a numb sensation in it's place. She sat down slowly, still glaring at Ghost halfheartedly. The runner scoffed, shaking his head. \"Like anyone would send you twits to kill someone. Those two couldn't even break out of the barn!\" Hautangi shrugged, uncaring now that he had his beer. Leilani had to concede that point: None of them were exactly master assassin material. \n\n\"What happens if we do draw attention?\" It was Nellie who asked the all important question, her keen mind treating this as just another event to plan out to the slightest detail. Ghost smiled, inordinately pleased that he could deliver another ominous one-liner.\n\n\"Then the Doctor will have performed her last surgery.\" Even Poindexter took notice now as the group realized that this woman's life now depended on their ability to do something quickly and quietly. Hautangi summed up their reaction succinctly.\n\n\"Well, she's fucked.\"",

        "text": "Despite being an elderly nerd of my early-30's, I am still relatively new to the world of tabletop games. I've learned of the last few decades of systems and lore primarily through the stories of my more experienced friends. One game my SO has always raved about is [Feng Shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Shui_\\(role-playing_game\\)), officially described as \"action movie roleplaying\" and unofficially described as exactly as ridiculous as it sounds like it would be. For example, my SO introduced me to the game by telling me about a game wherein he basically played Steven Seagal, able to arbitrarily climb through vents and jog slowly away uninjured from any explosion behind him.\n\nSo, when a friend of ours said he was going to run a one-off campaign from the [newly released second edition](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/148541/Feng-Shui-2), SO and I leapt at the chance. But an updated game requires updated tongue-in-cheek tropes, so we immediately decided to do our best to port-in versions of characters from [Kung Fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fury). I landed instantly on Barbarianna, but--after a suggestion from a friend--named my spin-off version Valkyria. Excitement growing, in the last week before we were scheduled to play, I was swept by inspiration and decided to [show up in actual costume](http://i.imgur.com/VVptzkx.jpg) to play the game. Fortunately, most of the cosplay pieces were things I already had or borrowed, but I did decide to splurge for the spiked bra off of Amazon, with rush shipping. \n\nThis would prove to be the best decision I made all week.\n\nSo the game begins. Since it's the first time for most of ut, we played the premade module The Lotus and the Poppy, which basically involves chasing down drug lords. We all get into the spirit of the fast-moving, over-the-top gameplay really quickly, though (perhaps aided by me [glaring ominously down the length of the table the whole time](http://i.imgur.com/2qdSqP1.jpg)) and are having an excellent time with it. \n\nIn the final battle, we've found the drug lords' hideout and are mowing down mooks and mini-bosses as we try to reach the final boss. I acquire an uzi from the carnage and, cape swirling as I turn in dramatic slow motion, raise it to unleash hell on a cluster of ninja lackeys--\n\nAnd I fail the roll. \n\nThe GM shrugs. \"Whelp, guess you left the safety on....\"\n\nThe gun clicks uselessly in my hands, but I dive out of the way just in time to avoid a hail of bullets coming my way.\n\nMy next round, I *very clearly* state that I unclick the safety, then leap from behind cover and once again open-up.  This time, the roll goes *dramatically* in my favor, so not only do I kill the cluster of mooks, but I send a barrel of gasoline spiraling away to explode against the building they were pouring out from, collapsing the doorway and trapping the rest of them inside.\n\n(Had the GM stated before that barrels of gasoline were around? Nope, they simply appeared when they needed to. Because this is an action movie, and that's how this game do :D)\n\nOne of the last mini-bosses is nearby, directing the remaining mooks, so in my next turn I make a dramatic rush toward him.\n\nBut then another nearby explosion knocks us both off our feet. We go flying. I land on top of him, but my gun is knocked from my hands. Dazed, I sit up and grope quickly for any other weapon--\n\n\"Wait,\" one of the other players says, out of game. \"Why don't you just stab him with your bra?\"\n\nEveryone at the table pauses, considering this. \"I mean,\" I say slowly, \"I *guess* that counts as martial arts....\"\n\nSo, in the game, I immediately flop back down and start pummeling him with 34-DD's of spiked fury.\n\nThe table laughs uncontrollably as I grab my dice to make the roll...then laughs harder as I fail that roll too.\n\n\"Yeaaah,\" the GM says, \"It doesn't do much. In fact, it's clear he's enjoying this.\"\n\n\"But I'm not going to be able to motorboat him to death, will I?\" I grumble.\n\nWhen my next turn comes around, though, I'm determined. I, Valkyria Barbariannatochter, shall not slink off and let my honor stand so maligned....\n\n\"What are you gonna do?\" the GM asks.\n\n\"Same thing,\" I say, glowering down the table.\n\nHe grins. \"Still the motorboating?\"\n\n\"Yes, but MOTORBOATING INTENSIFIES!!\" I yell through the laughter in the room. I grab my dice, make the roll...\n\n...Which, by the blessings of Freya, once again goes *dramatically* in my favor.\n\nEveryone looks at me to describe what happens. I look down at my bra, then make a mock-gasp. \"Oh! Shit! I left the safety on *these* too!\"\n\nIn the game, still shimmying like my life depends on it, I flip a hidden switch, replacing my rave-spikes with real stileto-tipped studs, instantly turning the drug-lord's grinning idiot face into mincemeat.\n\nWhile the room laughs, I pick up my gun and stand, posing dramatically, the draft from the nearby fires swirling my cape as their light glistens off my blood-streaked chrome. I turn directly to the camera, smirk, and say, \"Is it just me, or is it cold in here?\"\n\n\n[Feng Shui 2](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/148541/Feng-Shui-2). Gameplay: 11/10, would play again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\nSo with the conclusion of a story that has yet to be told ( I swear I'll tell it tomorrow when I'm less tired. ) Super Spook and company had rescued the daughter of the  Queen of the Taser, *cough* I mean land. They were all set to head home when suddenly a hole opened up and Spook was swallowed into the Under-dark, pulling the princess of recent abusive, with him.   \nI think this pretty well sums up the princess's thoughts   \nfor the next 90 seconds \n\n FREE FALL. WEE.  No my bad, a better translation reveals \n    somerescuefuckmylife.jpeg. strange.\n\nLuckily, our hero and damsel, are saved by what I'm sure is not a trademarked flower cushion- plot device. \n\n\n\n\nOur  adventurer, lands more or less unharmed and with princess in hand. \nHe lights a torch. \nand beholds something that can only be described as the unholy byproduct of a three way between a giant lizard, cauliflower, and the creature from the black lagoon. \nInitiative is rolled, second comes our hero and so  he takes 5 damage from the tongue of  the vegetable lizard.\n\nDammed if even cauliflower doesn’t want to kill you in the underdark, as parasitic spores begin sprouting between our hero's chainmail.\n\nHe rolls anime to leap on top of the creature and scores a 23.  I regret making  that skill canon as i’m basically giving +5 to any attack / check once per day.\nBut at least he looks cool.  \nHe is very anime in his leap and as such is able to recover from being bucked, leaped back atop the beast and set it alight with his torch. \nLizards, goo, vegetables all burn well, and that fight burns itself out. \n\nUnfortunately our hero continues being spored for 1d6 damage each round, and so chooses to, very carefully, set himself on fire.  \nRemarkably, he is unhurt, though he does smell like burnt gumbo oddly enough.\n\nThe hero leads his charge further, and as they pass through a narrow tunnel, they proceed to see light and three forms scattered throughout the room, while  a fourth person, hidden in shadow, occasionally howls like a wolf, seemingly for no reason. \n\nSpook and the princess try to remain hidden, but are soon spotted by the keen eyes of what turn out be as far as Spook can tell, some subterranean version of the elvish legend. (Dark Elves.) \nThe Dark Elves  are masters of the Underdark. They are by demand and by nature, violent and cruel, and they kill all who trespass in or near their cities.\n\nThey demand to know who spook is, having never quite seen his like before, and telling him that he and the princess must as intruders, be swiftly killed. \n\nHere I expected a fight to break out, but instead Spook rolls to convince them that he is “ In the middle of a shit day, this is just a terrible misunderstanding. “ He tells the as yet untold adventure of above, attempting to convey his sorry and unfortunate state to the guards, and   arouse their sympathies. \nI let him roll for persuasion \n 12\n14 \nTwo guards mildly convinced, but it's not enough. \nThe head guard: NAT 20. Crit. \nGREAAAAT\nThis guard, this elf who has been raised to hate all surface dwellers, firmly commiserates with Spook. He wants to let him go,   But years of social conditioning die hard and he feels he must demand tribute. \n  \nThere is talk of him giving them the princess as payment, but when all non-elf parties quickly express disagreement, negotiations are on the verge of collapse. \n\n Head Guard:  We’re going to have to kill you. it's the only way\n2nd Burly Guard: Why Shouldn’t we kill you anyway\nSpook “ I- er. “You shouldn’t kill me because I make a mean chocolate milkshake”\n\nMe. Jokingly. Roll to convince them you make a mean chocolate milkshake.\nDOUBLE 20\n\nThey are firmly convinced you make the best chocolate milkshake in the world and now all they really want\n\nIS TO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THAT IS.\n\nThus proceeds a lengthy discussion  where spook attempts to describe terrian ingredients to sub terrian people. \n\nThink the intensive effort an American employees when they're trying to explain something to someone abroad and they think it's so obvious, now\n imagine \n You are the American. In a neighborhood you DON'T to be in!\nAnd unless you talk really nice real fast, through the language barrier,  your “tour guide” may leave you to better introduced to whatever shadows are moving in that back alley. This will give you a good feel for the tension. \n\nAfter a mixture of colorful description and dirt pictionary.\n\nThe head guard has an idea and he sends his two friends away.\n\nAmazingly Spook does nothing and after a while the guards come back with a strange set of ingredients and say, \nmake us the chocolate milkshake!\nSpook tries. He tries really hard. But he can only manage around a 14 which with these ingredients won’t be enough. but then the Princess more familiar with chocolate jumps in with the assist. 3.     \n\nBut wait! From the darkness hope. \nThe prisoner with a voice strangely familiar to the princess, begins to interject. \nIt is the worldly court advisor Cauis Grey.  How he got here is a mystery for later, but with his help 8, the three manage to couple together a milkshake   \n\nwhich glowing a pale shade of green PROBABLY  isn’t poisonous . like 80% sure\n\nBurly guard drinks it, fairly impressed and NOT poisoned. \nHead guard.is slightly more impressed but equally NOT poisoned.\nscrub guard.  Feels a weird pain in his stomach… and is violently ill.\n\nThe head guard is very concerned, and just barely manages to catch the milkshake before it hits the ground. \n\nThey aren’t too concerned about foul play, because the two senior guards are fine, and they figure some elves just can’t hold their milkshake. \n\nHowever to be safe they have are hero try it, He takes a deep breaths, swigs and \n\nIt tastes bitter. But he’ll live. \n\nThe elves have their tribute, and what’s more they have a way to explain everything, including the “escape’ of their annoying prisoner    A terrible affliction was wrought on their comrade and in the confusion he slipped his bonds and was free. They know how to spin the tale just right.\n\nOur heros, now 2 + Damsel. Continue on until they come to a place where the cavern narrows. Up above they see a light. Caius manages  to climb up, drops a rope and Spook climbs up.\nFinally they haul princess up and crawl off the ledge into the room adjacent. \n \nAt its center stands a stone pillar illuminated by light, To the left marble and obsidian stones lead up to an exit.    \n\nSpook thinking he sees something snags one of the  ring off the pillar\nwhile his companions look on in confusion.  \n\nThey climb the steps and exiting a long cave here the sounds of war. \n\nAll’s well. \n\nI mean. That scrub guard is totally a slave for his failure to remain strong against the enemy \nBut are heroes got away (with bling ) , and the legacy of the chocolate milkshake spreads.  ",

        "text": "Cast of Characters:\n- Gimmdren - Dwarf ranger\n- Gylwynn - Elf rogue/hoarder\n- Synryn - Gnome cleric who insists on being referred to as an alchemist -instead of a cleric\n- Frilborinn - Half elf rogue/swashbuckler\n\nToday's story starts where my last story ended, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/43gxz1/the_con_artist_the_hoarder_and_the_sorcerer_or/).\n\nAt the end of my last story Gimmdren and Synryn were being arrested for assault, and Gylwynn and Frilborinn were still stuck in the chamber they were teleported to. At the beginning of today's session Gylwynn found that the wall of the chamber they were in was actually a magical barrier, and Synryn disabled it. Outside of the barrier were three town guards, which they proceeded to fight. But upon killing the first one, they realized they were actually doppelgangers disguised as town guards. During this fight, the near impossible happened, 5 natural 1s were rolled IN A ROW during a series of attack and damage rolls. After everyone stopped hitting themselves, one of the doppelgangers grappled Frilborinn, dealing enough nonlethal damage to stagger him over a series of turns. Eventually, with only one point of nonlethal damage left before faining, Frilborinn attacked the doppelganger... and rolled another natural 1, hitting himself in the face and knocking himself unconscious. Luckily, Gylwynn was able to finish off the doppelgangers on her own and tie up one that they managed to knock out instead of killing.\n\nMeanwhile, Gimmdren and Synryn are in their cell, which they happen to be sharing with the con artist who was arrested alongside them. They attempt to intimidate the man but to no avail, and eventually go to sleep for the night. In the morning they are taken to their trial, the judge is an old, bald man with a long beard (sound familiar?). Once the trial begins Synryn casts zone of truth on the con artist, but it doesn't really matter because the con artist manages to find a way to testify against the party without explicitly lying. During the trial I have songs from Phoenix Wright playing to set the mood. Near the end of the trial the con artist calls his star witness, the guard who tried to arrest the party last session but Synryn angered by shouting insults at. The guards name just \"happens\" to be constable Richard Gumshoe (oh come on, you write a courtroom session and tell me if YOU can do it without Phoenix Wright references). After cross examination the judge calls a recess to decide on a verdict.\n\nMeanwhile Gylwynn and Frilborinn are interrogating the doppelganger they didn't kill. Frilborinn has woken up at this point. Since Gylwynn had shouted \"I WILL BATHE IN YOUR BLOOD\" earlier on, she decided to keep her word, and proceeded to further mutilate the two corpses and bathe in their blood. The surviving doppelganger stared in disbelief and horror as she defiled his comrades' corpses. After seeing that, the doppelganger was quick to give answers. The only information of note was that he worked for Ianxidor, as did the con artist, and that Ianxidor was the leader of an organization called the Shadow of the Sea.\n\nAfter letting the doppelganger go Gylwynn washed the blood off of her and went with Frilborinn to the castle to tell the king that they had a lead. On the way to the castle, a paperboy sells them a newspaper, the headline is about Gimmdren and Synryn's trial. So Gylwynn and Frilborinn go to the castle, and tell the king about the trial. The king promised to pardon the party if they were found guilty, and Gylwynn and Frilborinn went off to testify.",

        "text": "Wow I did not get enough sleep last night… oh well tale time again.\n\nThis is from the last session of my explorer campaign before our group takes a hiatus to switch dms. But of course they had to go out by breaking the fuck out of the game and disrupting a module. Now breaking modules is a bit harder than my homebrew encounters since wizards of the coast has been making adventures considerably longer than I have been alive I would hazard to even say that they know what they are doing. Of course I had the stupid idea to send my players into a lv 1-15 module with our preexisting level 7 party, running through level 1 to 4 areas as op beasts but these breaks are impressive despite the level difference. These two tales are pretty ridiculous and breaks that I thought deserved to be told, this is kinda one and a half tales in one so I warn that it will be longer. Again the party is kiki the mute drow rogue, Verlan the human wizard, Django the human ranger and Wabe the gnome bard. Here we go.\n\n**Break number one** comes shortly after the concert at Slubloodop, things have cooled down around there and the party decides on their next destination. Since none of their options are particularly close they have a 20 day swim across a lake to make. Power players among them my party decides that magic is a better option than swimming yet they have no teleportation spells that could land them that far at this level. Instead they look to the sky. They spent an actual hour doing math to determine actually how fast this flight will be and by polymorphing the ranger into a dragon and riding on his back and with a mix of haste spells they manage to fly along at 50 miles per hour over the lake for one hour. Then at the end of the hour they cast Leomunds tiny hut on the back of the dragon, since it remains suspended wherever it was cast they pull the ranger in and all take a long rest in the levitating hut until they can cast all their spells again. They did this for 2 ½ ingame days until they completely bypassed the lake and all possible encounters that would have made this into a perilous journey. So they destroyed the plan there.\n\n**The second** and more disruptive break is when they threw a big bad out of the campaign. To avoid spoilers I’m not saying where they were or what led up to this, what matters is that on their way there they found a bag of holding that the previous owner… won’t be needing anymore and that their journey has put them face to face with the demon queen of fungi, Zuggtmoy. This is one of the bigger bosses of all of D&amp;D, one of those darned foes that has multitudes of cults worshipping them and could fuel their own campaign. In this module she is one of a set of demon lords involved but at this point the party stands no chance at a fight even at their enhanced level and this point of the module has no intention of having the characters fight her at all. \n\nThe party, of course, decides to attack her.\n\nThey start by throwing a lovely bouquet in her direction made of a number of flammable mushrooms and a single bead of fireball which collectively makes a 14d6 firebomb. Then she disappears into the ground before the ranger (polymorphed into a dragon, that will be a recurring theme now.) could get his acid breath at her. Short monologue later the party has begun initiative against a monster that can party wipe level 20s. Turn one, the bard gives his inventory to the rogue, takes the ranger’s Heward’s Handy Haversack and their newly acquired bag of holding and offers a monologue of his own. Paraphrased: “ I’ve spent my entire life singing the praises of heroes, telling the tales of champions and monster slayers. Well this one is mine. I’ve seen worse fungus than you between my toes, now DIE YOU ROTTING WHORE!” Bard blinks to a foot in front of Zuggtmoy and stares her down as he puts the bag of holding into the Haversack. Those of you who know D&amp;D probably know that doing so rips a hole in reality and throws everything around it into the astral plane. \n\nA flash of silver light and the bard and the demon are gone. Cast into a different plane of existence. The servants of Zuggtmoy nearby sense her distress and charge the party who hop onto a bronze griffon summoned from a figurine of wondrous power and beat a hasty retreat. The problem here is that Zuggtmoy is integral for later chapters in the module and her being in the wrong plane kinda disrupts that. They managed to find a simple way to break even a professionally made module so maybe there is no hope for making plans as their dm. There is a way I can get things back on track but that depends on how the solo session with wabe goes which will begin in a plane he knows nothing about 2 feet from a deific enemy that wants him dead like nobody’s business. So that should be fun. As much as they break my shit and other’s I still have fun with these bastards.\n",

        "text": "Recently my group undertook the greatest dragon fight of my RPG career.  In fact, not only was it the best, it was frankly the only dragon fight I've ever ran that actually felt *epic* enough to really distinguish itself as a legendary encounter worthy of the title \"Dragon Fight\".  This is a Dungeon World game, and in fact I posted this in /r/dungeonworld a while back but decided to share here as well.\n\nHere is the highlight reel account of our tale (warning: long!  This fight took about 2 hours)\n\n**The Dragon:**\n\nRed Dragon,  Antharak the Blind.  Standard DW dragon stats (16hp, etc etc)\n\nLegendary Features: after losing his eyesight, Antharak cut a deal to have a necromantic eye bound to him to restore his sight.  The eye orbits his head like an Ioun stone, and grants these additional moves:\n\n- reflect a spell back on the caster\n- permanently conjure a displaced mirror image of Antharak some 30' away\n- permanently cloak Antharak in magical camoflage making him nearly invisible\n\n**The Setup:**\n\nOur heroes (levels 7-9) sail forth to slay Antharak, knowing that he is preying upon ships flying Clan colors.  They go prepared:  a ballista rigged with a single bolt armed with a magical electricity \"bomb\".  A tricksy rope that is self-propelled and obeys verbal commands.  A crystal that makes the holder invisible (but also blinds him).  A legendary shield that has promised its paladin wielder that it can \"protect him and all those who have faith in him\" from dragonfire.\n\n**The Plan:**\n\nSail a small ship with a skeleton crew into the Straights of Albaran, where the dragon is known to prey. The nearby island is riddled with deep caves that they plan to run to once they engage the dragon, hoping to lure it into a confined space.  They hope to trick the dragon into thinking that their Dashing Hero is in fact the Fae swordsman who blinded it centuries ago, thus enraging it and tricking it into the caves.\n\n**The Encounter:**\n\nWith the druid flying high high above the ship and whispering to the elemental air spirits, the approach of Antharak is detected.  Our druid follows the spirits whispers and spots the dragon heading for the ship.  He triggers a signal to those aboard, and then stoops, aiming for the floating eye.  Oh no!  His talons pass through thin air, he's been tricked by the illusion!\n\nThe dragon opens its great maw, revealing the elemental fire within. Those on board the ship are braced for its approach but are struck by waves of terror as they stare at their impending doom.  The paladin, who must Defend with his magic shield, finds that he's lost control of his limbs (failed his defy danger), but the Dashing Hero bravely runs to the ballistae to fire.  But just in time, the cleric (who has an all-seeing third eye) notices that her ally is aiming askew: the dragon's illusion has fooled all but her.  \"Don't shoot, it's an illusion!\" she screams, as she runs to slap the paladin back to his senses.\n\nThe fireball billows forth from the dragon's initial strafing run.  The Dashing Hero follows the cleric's advice and refrains from wasting their single shot.  The paladin regains his senses and gets his shield up just in time:  a magical aura springs forth and spreads to cover everyone who demonstrates their true faith in him (all but one crew member, who burns).  The ship catches fire wherever the shield was not in place, but the heroes planned ahead and had barrels full of water rigged all around the boat, and the crew start to smash them to douse the flames.\n\nAbove, our druid shifts tactics and loops around and up again, this time ignoring his eyes and listening to the air spirits.  He zeroes in on the dragon and goes for another strike, but he misjudges and takes a tail whip from the beast (another 6- here).  Instead of taking the massive damage, he Sheds it and reverts to human form.  Falling now directly into the burning rigging, he uses his tricksy rope to lash onto the main mast, causing him to swing around it like a tether ball.\n\nThe paladin stops to survey the scene, putting together all the pieces: the cleric's warning of an illusion, the failed eagle strike, the scorch marks left by the *real* fire.  He succeeds in penetrating the illusion and can now see the dragon's true form.  He informs everyone else.\n\nMeanwhile the dragon is looping around for another run, but the cleric has him in her sights.  She begins to cast an Empowered \"Sever\" spell to lop off it's wings: a natural 12!  Critical success (houserule here).  The spell is of gargantuan proportions, but as she targets the dragon she can feel him mirroring it back at her!  What do you do, cleric?  \"I feign ignorance of his tactic, and let the spell sling back at me, but I divert it ever so slightly and sling it right back at him!\"  Defy Danger: INT - another full success!  Unbelievable!  The Sever spell shocks the dragon as his reversal is reversed, and both wings are cut off at the shoulder.  With a shriek it dives into the water;  but all is not over: the dragon is enraged and its a natural swimmer.\n\nNow it's approaching again, this time from the back and under water.  The captain warns the heros that the ship's magical propulsion could be ruined if the dragon fire burns up the magical sigils etched into the rear panel of the ship.  Our dashing hero, who was climbing up the rigging to help the druid, dives into action.  He grabs a nearby rope, swings across the boat and free-dives over the back railing into the water below, planning to stretch the magical shielding over the boat's rear end.  \n\nAgain the paladin takes up station atop the stern, this time bracing strongly with a Defend move (holds 4).  The druid tries to shift into water elemental form to escape his entanglement and get to the deck.  This results in a failure that we'll cut back to momentarily...\n\nThe Dashing Hero, now clinging to the lower reaches of the boat and dragging through the black roiling water, sees the dragon's head rearing up, about to unleash another fireball.  The shield is flowing down, but it's not going to reach him in time!  What do you do?  \"Wait,\" says the paladin, \"I push the shield down to cover the Hero!\"  OK, spend 2 hold to accelerate the magical shield's extension!\n\nThe elemental fire breath is unleashed again.  The Hero is singed by the intial heat wave but protected by the magical shielding just before being struck by the bulk of the fire.  The flame washes over the boat from stern to tip.  Most of the ship is shielded, but the druid turned water elemental is so distracted by the feeling of being evaporated by the heat that his human mind, including the requisite \"faith in the paladin\" necessary to be shielded, slips away.  He is again exposed to the dragonfire, but again he Sheds the damage (but takes a Weakness debility).\n\nThe Paladin spends his last hold to give the Hero \"an opening and +1 forward\" against the dragon, which results in the dragon assuming him to be roasted and has him swim within striking distance before submerging.  The Hero unleashes his Elemental Rapier and blasts a bolt of lightning into the dragon's floating eye, wounding it and blinding it.  The dragon dives deep as a result, and the Hero scrambles up to the deck again.\n\nAt this point the dragon has no wings and is momentarily blinded.  The druid summons the spirits of the ocean water and asks them to strip the dragon's eye from the beast.  He chooses to \"have the effect come to pass\" and \"retain control\", which means he must pay natures price.  The eye is thus snatched away from the dragon, shot forth from the ocean and smashed into the druid's own eye socket, as the Goddess of the Ocean whispers to him, \"Thou shalt pay the price for involving me in this unnatural conflict of yours\".\n\nNow truly blind, the dragon crawls up the bow of the boat and spitefully capitulates to the heros, saying, \"you have stripped me of both my vision and my debt to he who granted it to me.  There is no further reason to carry on this conflict.  What would you have me do?\"\n\n*The cleric stands at the ballista, aimed at the dragon at point-blank range.  We cut short as it was late: will the cleric fire?  Will they parley with the dragon?*\n\n**As we pick up in the next session:**\n\nOur cleric takes aim at the dragon and mutters, \"Shoot first, ask questions later.  Literally!\" and unleashes on the dragon.  The bolt flies true and hits the great beast square between the eyes, but the bolt's harpoon-like cord is wrapped around her ankle!  The dragon's great scales prevent most of the bolt damage, but the electricity bomb triggers and mostly fries the thing.  Frying blood squirts out, but it's not dead!  *(it literally has 1 hp left from it's initial 16hp.  Yes, in DW dragons have 16hp and still very hard to kill)*.\n\nEnraged, the dragon's maw gapes wide and the fireball in its throat sends shivers down everyone's spine.  Struggling to avoid paralyzing fear, the paladin tries to get his shield up again, but it's not quite in time. But wait!  The Dashing Hero darts forth and puts his hand on the Paladin's shoulder, urging him on \"I've got your back, Hamur!\"  With this added strength, the paladin succeeds but can only extend the shield over half his companions.  He chooses those in behind him (not the cleric or druid).  The cleric darts *forward*, getting underneath the beast's head and out of the blast, trying to touch it's great claw on the gunwale to deliver a killing spell.  But no, the rope goes taught and she smacks face-first into the deck, only 2 feet from it's claw!\n\nThe druid shifts into fire elemental form and braces for impact.  The fire rips along the ship from bow to stern.  The cleric manages to evade it, but the druid is swept up in the swirling embrace.  He tries to keep himself together, but the elemental fire of the dragon is diffusing his body, trying to sweep him away into nothingness!  He manages to hold himself together but is dazed and spun out of control upwards in the billowing eddies.\n\nThe fire washes safely over the paladin, the Dashing hero and the rest of the crew.  The Dashing hero takes a run at the beast as it rears up and he leaps over the bow, straight at it's head.  He slashes with his Elemental Rapier and unleashes pure Shadow in a narrow arc at the dragon.  The blackness cuts clean and true, severing the creatures head from its body.   The head, the body and the Hero plunge into the icy waters below, where some further scrambling results in the Hero managing to save and retrieve the dragon head from the depths.\n\nOn board, the ship is fully on fire and the bow is destroyed.  The ship is sinking fast, but the druid has his bearings again, and the paladin is reacting quickly.  But before they react, the cleric whips out her great ruby and traps the dying dragon's soul inside the gem.  While the druid commands the fire spirits to rally to him (abandoning the ship) the Paladin sprouts his magical wings (a compendium class we made up) and swoops in to snatch the cleric from harm's way.  In the process, the cleric almost fumbles the gem, but manages to hang on to it as she's carried to safety.\n\nThe day is saved!\n\n*...and* **that's** *how a Dungeon World fight should be!*",

        "text": "**Nephian date November 15 - They journey begins**\n\nThe Driller woke us up with quite a start, slamming the bacon-filled pan on the table. Everyone began to stir, woken up either by the noise or the smell of breakfast. By the time I was finished packing my bedroll, Helia was already on the table nibbling on some bacon. When most of us were gathered at the table, Driller filled us in on recent events. Apparently, around the same time we 'fell' into the world a whole kingdom was pulled in on the other side of the world and they weren't very happy about it. They attacked the country of Rothegrin, creating quite a mess for everyone. We were told not to worry about the dragon's claw for now as another team was sent to recover it. She told us that we are going to board captain Geba's ship and sail towards Rothegrin where Arin - the pint sized hero her self would be waiting for us. Soon after breakfast we set for the docks where Geba was already waiting with his ship. I enjoyed a nice morning swim in the ocean as we waited for everyone to get ready. Just as I got out of the water I saw a portal open right in front of doctor Cain, resident plague doctor. A woman stepped out and handed him a pouch of coins before disappearing again. Strange world. Finally on board the Primarose, I saw Psy, the curly haired boy, look quite uneasy about being on a ship. I turned to wave goodbye to Driller, but she was already gone. And so our journey together began.\n\n**Nephian date November 18 - The Clockwork city**\n\nNothing noteworthy happened for the first three days of the voyage. Psy was slightly sea-sick for the first day and a half but then seemed to get used to it. On the fourth day I saw a shadow in the sky. As we sailed closer we saw that it was actually a city! The captain explained that this was the clockwork city. It was a marvelous thing, more than 45 miles across and constructed mostly from gold and brass. I need to go take a closer look at it one day. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until November 20th.\n\n**Nephian date November 20 - The Twin Towers**\n\nEarly in the morning of the fifth day we saw something glistening to the north. The captain sailed closer, so that he could show us what it was. It was a pair of towers, glistening in the morning sun. They looked to be made of some sort of crystal. The light reflecting off them created beautiful patterns on the surface of the sea. \"These are the twin towers of Adelsteinn\", he explained, \"The Mermaids and waterfolk built them for trade on the surface\". I thought there might be others such as my self. But now I know where to find them. I was tempted to jump into the water right there and then and swim closer, but we had been given a task. There will be time later.\n\n**Nephian date November 23 - Demos city**\n\nWe had finally arrived to Demos. The sun was just coming up when we saw the great marble walls inlaid with gold in the distance. \"This is the Country of Demos! Welcome to the White Castle of Nephia.\", said captain Geba with a smile on his face. It was late morning when we docked at the marble city on the island of Naren. Demos is one of the three warring kingdoms of the island, Rothegrin and Saxos being the other two. The kingdoms have been at war for over 400 years over the feather of a great phoenix. \n\nAs we were standing on the docks, planning out what to do next and preparing our supplies for the hike through the mountains (to which I was not looking forward to), lady Arin Stanton approached us. Auntie told me about her. She always wanted to be a hero, but couldn't due to her health troubles. Apparently, the Architect had instructed her to come to the white city today and help us out. I wondered if it was the same person that Dantalya met. She said she was on her way to help the other team with the dragon claw. She was going to test if The Widowmaker can hurt it.  \n\nShe started walking towards the city gates and motioned us to follow. On the way she told us more about the history of this place. \"Demos was originally built by King Demos nearly 600 years ago, when N.E. first started the God war. His brothers King Saxos and King Rothgrin agreed they wanted to help fight back against the gods. The war ended in a horrible massacre.  It was said that the kings resurrected Nephia with the feather of the three kingdoms in honor to the glory of the people of Nephia. When she awoke she created this Island for the brothers to live together in harmony.\", She explained. But of course, the story doesn't end there. During the course of history, someone stole the feather and war broke out between the three kingdoms. Each accused the other of theft. The curious par is, while the kingdoms have been here for nearly 600 years, the people think it has only been 400. The reason being that Pandemonium, the goddess of time sealed them off in a void dimension for 200 years as punishment for losing the feather. Its fate is still unknown. I believe it is still out there somewhere, probably not on the island anymore. Arin, however thinks the feather was destroyed in the process of resurrecting Nephia.\n\nAbout half-way to the city gates, just as I was beginning to wonder if we'll walk all the way to Rothegrin, a huge carriage pulled up, escorted by a pair of Arin's bodyguards. She climbed on, with a bit of help from Titan, one of her guards, and told us to to board as well. As soon as the last of us climbed on and the door was shut, the carriage jerked into motion. I decided to practice playing the violin during the ride. I haven't had a chance to practice yet today. Arin had a bit of an exchange with Ren. I don't think he's taking the fact that he is now in Nephia well. \n\nSome time later Zalisa informed us that we are entering Rothergrin and pulled down the curtains. When Psy questioned why, she whispered to him, that there is quite a lot of destruction and suffering and she doesn't want Arin to see it. \"I guess no matter what world we're on, there's always strife...\", said Psy. Ella, who had been rather quiet up to now sighed and added \"All that changes are the names...\"\n\nThe cart came to a stop just outside of town and we were directed to go north. Arin was also left us each with a small package containing some food, a bedroll, lantern, a few pitons, a length rope and a knife. How nice of her, I thought. As we began walking north towards Altrazin Empire we hear someone yell \"UNIT,AMBUSH!\". \"That's not how you usually ambush someone\", I thought to my self. Then we saw four dozen archers approach from the north, led by a general. I looked back towards the carriage, but it was already quite far away. We'd be getting no more help from Arin it seems.\n\nEveryone scrambled behind the cover of rocks as quickly as they could. Well, everyone except me and the good doctor. I was too slow to get there and he didn't quite react fast enough. Then suddenly a man appeared out of nowhere, also hiding behind a rock. He had a huge grin on his face. He looked like he was having fun! The archers fired a few more volleys but luckily no-one was hit. The new arrival rushed out to meet the captain head on. It looked like he got a few good hits on her, but she was unfazed. Amalas soon followed him to engage her in combat. \n\nMeanwhile, Lead scaled the rock they were hiding behind, moving like a skilled climber. Then, instead of shooting off an arrow, he for some reason decided to throw the lantern lady Arin had given us. He fumbled the throw and it landed in front of him, exploding in his face. Little did he know it was a magical lantern. I saw what happened but the opposing army only saw the huge purple mushroom cloud that followed. His skin turned purple, with a shine to it. And he started acting really strangely towards his weapon. And a giant tree appeared out of nowhere. Magic does some strange things here in this world.. Meanwhile, Ella and Ren had also reached the captain and moved to flank her.\n\nThe army was so stunned by the explosion that they didn't fire any more arrows. I saw this as an opportunity to scare the army off. I approached them as swiftly as my tail could carry me over land. As I got the attention of a few soldiers I pretended to start weaving a new spell and asked who wanted to be next. The closest soldier took a cautious step back. His companion turned to him and whispered something. I saw him grow visibly paler as his question got answered. Murmurs spread across the line and the archers retreated shortly. \n\nMeanwhile, my companions have beaten the fight out of their commander and were now discussing what to do with her. She wouldn't listen to reason and would not surrender. Letting her go might come back to haunt us. Killing her might come back to haunt us even sooner. Then another man showed up. It was the Architect. THE Architect him self. Captain Zary was starting to act more and more erratic until finally Ren had enough and knocked her out.\n\nQuite a strange man, the Architect. He's not like I imagined him. He seemed a bit distracted at times. He told us he is giving us this land we're standing on. He told us to build our base of operations here and that it will be the first line of defense against the Altrazin Empire. I looked around the empty field of grass and stone and wondered how we are supposed to get anything done here. He threw a small rock on the ground. As soon as it hit it, it expanded, warped and shaped it self into something that resembled a gateway. \"This platform is called a Warp gate.\", he explained, \" In every major capital in Nephia one of these exist if you have to go somewhere I would suggest using it\". That solves the middle of nowhere problem at least... But it opens a new one. What if the army came back tomorrow? We had no chance of standing up to them again. We were lucky the first time as it was. \"I've given you the tools you need. Now it is up to you what you do with them\". And with that, he was gone. We were left standing around the gateway, a prisoner of war on our hands and wondering what happens next.\n",

        "text": "[Chapter 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/42jbv6/the_dead_guard_chapter_1/)\n\n**TL;DR:** *Four players arrive in a brand new city to start up some organized crime. The barbarian (Snöboll) is their dumb muscle, the elf (Kinarya) rents an apartment and sets up a medieval methlab, the faceman (Tertius) learns that you don't fuck with the Guard in this city and the thief (Peryxus) gets a commission from the Thieves Guild. During said commission he shoots both a guardsman and his Guild contact with crossbows. Now they're in deep shit.*\n\n\"Aw, fuck! Now what do we do?\" asks Peryxus' player, panic rising.\n\n\"We!?\" shout the other players in unison. \"We're not even there! You just spazzed out and shot a cop as well as a guild official!\"\n\nPeryxus eventually makes his way back to HQ and tells his comrades what happened. \n\n\"Hey, hey! Everybody calm down, nobody panic. We can fix this,\" says Tertius.\n\n\"The hell we can! I say we skip town tonight,\" retorts Kinarya.\n\n\"No, listen, we can spin this shit. Now, this is what *really* happened: 'The guardsman saw Pyrexus make the handoff. He drew his crossbow and ordered the two thieves to lay down their weapons. When they refused to comply he shot the guild guy in the chest. Acting in self defence our friend here shot the guard in the face and got the fuck out of there.\"\n\n\"You think they'll buy that?\" grumbles Snöboll.\n\n\"Trust me, it'll be fine. We just need to wait for them to contact us again. Shouldn't be too long.\"\n\nEarly the next morning another guild offical and half a dozen heavily armed thugs come round, demanding to know what the fuck happened last night. Tertius feeds him the bullshit story. His bluff skill is through the roof, so the official actually buys it. He figures the guardsman had to have been new on the force and therefore didn't know how things worked around here. Before leaving with the statuette he orders the PCs to lay low for a couple of weeks.\n\nMeanwhile the guard has found the the two bodies laying in the street, and they're flipping their shit. Turns out the Guard and the Thieves Guild had a deal in this district: 'We won't bother you if you don't bother us'. The Guard doesn't really have the manpower or the motivation to crack down on crime and the Guild knows that fighting the Guard is bad for business. So the guardsmen can enjoy the occasional bribe, nobody dies on either side and everyone's happy... you know, except for the law abiding citizens who keep getting dicked over, but who cares about them?\n\nSo when they find a dead guardsman next to a dead guild official they understandably get kinda pissed off. What follows are a few weeks of guards raiding Guild-owned pubs and warehouses, beating up low-ranking thieves, shutting down brothels and generally showing a larger presence in the streets than they have for years. They're not waging total war on the Guild, though, but rather just showing that they are extremely miffed over what has happened and that they want the leading crime lords to lose a bit of income.\n\nUnfortunately this also affects the PCs' budding narcotics trade. With so many coppers on the streets pushing the drugs is next to impossible. Since that was their main source of income they now find themselves losing money at an astonishing rate. After three weeks they end up in debt to a rival gang and to their cat loving landlady.\n\n\"Okay, seriously, we need to do something about this. I can't go down to the brothel across the street without some guard giving me shit,\" exclaims Peryxus one night.\n\n\"You shouldn't be going there in the first place. We can't even pay rent,\" Kinarya notes.\n\n\"Don't you see what they're doing? They're trying to send us a message that they're not to be fucked with. So we need to send *them* a message that this is *our* town, and that we do the fucking around here!\"\n\n\"We came here, like, two months ago.\"\n\n\"Did you have a plan or something?\" asks a bored Tertius.\n\n\"Oh, yeah,\" replies Peryxus with a grin, \"I've got a plan, alright.\"\n\nThe following afternoon a small procession of uniformed men carries a cheap coffin from the Watchhouse at St. Benarii Square to the Temple of Daak. All in all no more than a dozen people are present for the guardsman's funeral. A woman holding the hands of two small children looks on with tears in her eyes as the priest throws fine white ashes and fresh cow's blood onto the wooden lid. A tall man in a black captain's uniform puts his hand on her shoulder and clears his throat. Then he shudders as a crossbow bolt pierces his breastplate. For a few moments he looks down in astonishment at the white feathers sticking out of his chest, before collapsing onto the dry grass.\n\n50 yards away a thin man in a black cloak slips back into the shadows of an alleyway. \"There, that should learn them,\" he muses.\n\n\"That was your plan? THAT WAS YOUR PLAN YOU DENSE FUCKING **TOOL**!?\" Kinarya demands, frothing at the mouth.\n\n\"You know, this campaign isn't really going where I thought it would,\" I confess, \"but I gotta say, I'm really digging it.\"",

        "text": "Little background, me and a couple friends of mine used to play Minecraft on a server hosted by a friend of ours. The stars of this story are EvilCorgi (me), Malfael and DreamJar with Damarus and Ashlynn playing supporting roles. We had known each other for a pretty long time at this point, except for Dreamjar, who was new to our clique. We load up the map as a lightly forested plains biome. To the north-west of Spawn, an empty plain, and to the direct west, a hill. Our story takes place here.\n\nDreamjar makes a beeline to the western hill, and sets up a barebones base. We're talking a bed, a pit for his animals, a crafting bench, an oven and a chest. He didn't even build a building. The reason for this hasty settlement we would find out later.\n\nPast that hill farther west, between DreamJar's hill and the Rhine River (named such right now, by me, two years later) was Damarus' tower. Damarus was into metaphysics and threatened, and I quote, \"if you greif my fucking base I'm going to send demons to rape you in the ass.\" This is unrelated to the Griefing War of Little Deutschland, I just wanted to make sure I brought that up.\n\nAnyway, what is Little Deutschland, I hear you ask? That was the creation of Malfael and I. We created our own hill in survival mode to build a quaint German village on. We probably spent 10-12 hours just on the hill, and another two days on the first bits of the village. It was a pretty little thing. The joke, of course, was that Little Deutschland looked quaint on the outside, but as soon as you stepped through the gates, a bunch of Nazi imagery slapped you in the face. Our dairy farm was titled \"Dachau\" (I lobbied for Cowchwitz) and our wheat farm was in the shape of a swastika and had a sign in front of it that said \"Lebensraum\". It was... less than subtle. Even though it was sort of a cheap joke, we poured hours and hours into it. A beautifully planned and constructed village atop a terraformed hill.\n\nSo after finishing the chapel, complete with pews, a bell tower and a golden cross (again, made in survival), Malfael and I logged off, leaving DreamJar on the server alone. Up until this point, we'd had no clue where he was. He was on the server but nowhere to be found for like 3 days. We had the pleasure of finding out when Malfael logged on on top of a giant hole, right through the center of the hill we made, with the bottom covered in Lava. Out of nowhere, Dreamjar had killed all our prisoners in Dachau, stolen anything of value in our village and ran off. This was not at *all* the tone we had set, so it was a bit of a shock. We confronted him outside of the game and talked to him about it. We were pretty pissed off but he didn't seem to get that we were serious. Eventually we negotiated our stuff back, and got Ashlynn to shift the server to creative so we could fix our hill. Meanwhile, Dreamjar was gone from his shitty camp again. \n\nNow us being friends and all, we'd assumed that a good \"hey man stop being a penis\" would be enough to get him to stop. We were wrong. When I logged back on in the middle of the night after a bit of insomnia, I managed to catch him laying TNT in little Deutschland. I logged into Ventrilo, told him to do the same and yelled at him for about 5 minutes. That was seriously not okay, and he sort of seemed to get it this time. Mal talked to him as well when he got back, and DreamJar told him that he was used to a more anarchy style of server. He honestly didn't know that we were going for a more co-operative feel, and wanted to negotiate some PvP.\n\nWe begrudgingly went along with it, and set up a DEFCON system essentially. Basically, we had to agree on a set level of aggression. DEFCON 1 was no PvP, DEFCON 5 was TNT, basically. We set it to 2 (PKing, raiding of non-valuable items) basically just to shut DreamJar up. \n\nNeither of us were having fun at this point. We were rebuilding shit that Dreamjar fucked up, we had to build a secret base to keep stuff we didn't want him to steal, and we had to stay on the server in shifts to keep him away from our stuff. Even after all that, DreamJar still sometimes managed a cheapshot that would kill whoever was on guard duty and jack a bunch of stuff. He would even cheat the system he helped to set up and steal some of our actual blocks, and grief our buildings. At this point we were both pretty much ready to quit.\n\nWe finally decided that we were going to hit his encampment to dissuade him from the griefing war. If that didn't work, we were going to play without him. We waited until he left, and set out. We took his animals (note, we didn't kill them like he did ours, we only hid them) burried his chests with the items inside like three blocks under where they were already, stuff like that. We didn't break or destroy or even steal anything, we just hid it. We even left his noisy animals with his chests as a hint to dig. We left a large cobblestone swastika where his camp once was, and a single sign that read \"Aunchless\"\n\nHe was *livid*. He levied upon us a vocal shitstorm that dwarfed all the damage he did to Little Deutschland in comparison. An argument went on and on about how we were unfair to him, and how we broke the rules, and we must not like him at all, and countless histrionics that blew the whole problem far out of proportion. It was insane. Even after we told him where his stuff was he was just freaking out.\n\nAnd then he left. Not the game, our social group. He logged off of Voip, left the IRC server, everything. We never heard from Dreamjar again. All over a minecraft war.\n\nDeutschland developed a fine little pretzel bakery on the ruins of what was once Little Warsaw. Damarus' Demonrape Tower was accepted into the Axis, and there was Lebensraum and Weinerschnitzel for everyone. And they lived happily ever after.",

        "text": "A few years ago, popular minecraft youtube channel *The Yogscast* started a series based on a giant mod called Voltz. I, at the time, was a large fan of theirs, and the end of the series immediately made me want to start playing on my own. I downloaded a special launcher and found a nice server for it. The setup was like a large number of hardcore servers. If you die, you're gone for about a month. Difference is, this server would reset the blacklist and map at the end of each month. That way everyone gets a fresh start. I remember seeing the owner of the server on one of the first few days I joined,. I don't quite remember him, but I remember one aspect: The depressed looking eyes of his skin. I don't know if it was a character, or just a random one, but those eyes stand out.\n\nMy time began halfway through the month, and I didn't make much progress. The fact I didn't know too much about the mod certainly didn't help, but I slowly learned more and more. But this first month, I managed to build a missile launcher and pissed around with that... before killing myself by accident.\n\nThe next month, my goal was to start a war. Built up the missiles, and eventually launched them all at someone's base. Problem was, these were the lowest level of missiles, and also the lowest tier of launch pads, so it was neither accurate nor powerful. The missiles mostly missed, and the ones that did failed to do much to their concrete base. And once this group figured out where the missiles came from, they promptly returned fire, and destroyed my sad shack. I managed to survive, but then one of them wearing a suit of power armor came by and shot me with their plasma cannon.\n\nI needed a new approach. \n\nI spent the next month mostly watching a pair of players. They were quite kind and decided to help teach me some more of the game. This included things such as making nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, the aforementioned power armor, and several of the missiles. One of which was Red Matter, the most dangerous explosive in the mod. What it does is, essentially, create an unstoppable and slowly expanding black hole. The only way to stop it is to set off an Antimatter explosive near it, and send it flying far away. Surprisingly, it wasn't banned on the server, but very looked down upon.\n\nI didn't forward my attempt to start a war that month, but I learned a lot, felt confident to try next month, and didn't die to my own incompetence.\n\nThe next month, my plan began. Luckily, summer had arrived and I could devote most of my time to this. I mined for materials and built up a base on the first day. Quickly making progress and building up the proper materials. Now, the group I mentioned earlier also started building up as they usually did. Some days, none of them are on, especially late during the night. I used that to my advantage, and raided some of their supplies. This helped boost my progress greatly.\n\nOne day, a user I didn't recognize joined. I decided to take him in and make him my \"partner\". He was apparently pretty young. Around 10 or 11 or so. Unlike the pair from before, I didn't take the time to teach him. Instead, I just put him to digging. He dug and dug all that he could, getting materials I needed. He was happy to do so, and made a great \"ally\".\n\nNow, in order to keep safe, I started building a secret base. Only accessible through a secret walled-off passage deep in the caves below the regular base. I kept the important things stored there, but enough in the regular base not to make it look suspicious.\n\nNot quite two weeks into the month, I had a lot of tools at my disposal. I already had all the power I could need, and created a proper suit of power armor, which I gave to my \"ally\" which he really appreciated. ANd during one of my nightly raids, I found the bases stock of explosives. Nuclear missiles, anti-matter bombs, and more importantly: Red Matter bombs. I took a lot, but not all, and fled into the night.\n\nI sent my \"friend\" on a mission: Dig under their base, and set off the explosive. Though, I neglected to tell him just the destruction capabilities of this specific explosive, but he went for it anyway, while I waited at the base, amassing my stock of missiles and anti-matter.\n\nI watched from afar. The explosion and the crater that slowly appeared where there base was. Their names appeared in the text box, signaling the end of their lives for this month, and the end of the life of my poor \"ally\". The panic in the chat was clear, because if this wasn't taken care of, the server would be destroyed. I took the liberty of launching one of my anti-matter missiles at the remains of the base, flinging the mass of destruction away from the populated part of the world, and no one suspected a thing. Everything was going [just as planned](http://i.imgur.com/T5EkJq8.jpg).\n\nSadly, even if my revenge on them succeeded, there were other problems to worry about. Bigger and more powerful problems, but my stock was rising, and I'd have enough to beat them soon enough.\n\nIn the mean time, I found smaller groups or bases and threatened them for their materials. Most complied right away, but not all. A single user living on his own refused to give me what I needed. I decided to be merciful, and launched a smaller missile just near his base as a warning, and he complied afterwards. \n\nThis continued as I threatened them with larger and more powerful missiles, and my missile stock was gigantic, enough to wipe out the world.\n\nThe tension was rising, and I knew people were also getting ready to launch, but were too afraid. The term is Mutually Assured Destruction. If you fire at your enemy, they will fire back. And we weren't close enough to the end to make it worth it. At least, not for them.\n\nOnce I finally had enough missiles, I set up more launchers, some outside my regular base, but more in silos near my secret base. A place I could hide safely, as the location wasn't known. I could tell, as it was always left exactly as I would keep it, and the entrance was well hidden. I don't know if people even knew it was there.\n\nIt was finally time. Nuclear and antimatter missiles were in their places, all set to launch when I hit the switch. Aimed at all the biggest bases, and several just at nothing or smaller ones. I wanted to destroy them all, dig deep into their bunkers and manage to kill them where they think they're safe. I stared at the switch, debating whether I should hit it or not. Just what it'd cause, and how this all would end. Then I finally hit it...\n\n...And the world came crashing down.\n\nThe sound of explosions. Nuclear, anti-matter, even red matter explosives going off all over the game world. Names appeared in the chat list, many people were dying. When the explosions stopped, I restocked the launchers with missiles I had left, and set them off again. More names appeared. Then I did it again, and again, and again.\n\nWhen the world fell silent once again, and I heard no more explosions, I checked the users left on the server, and few remained. I put on hazard suit, and ventured out into what was left.\n\nCraters and nuclear waste were everywhere. A red-matter black hole laid in the ruins of my regular base, slowly expanding. Eventually, I saw a speck flying towards me. A name appeared, and I saw that it was the owner. The depressed expression on his character looking own at me, asking me what I was hoping to achieve by this.\n\n\"Destruction.\"\n\nHe was silent for a minute. Thinking of his response. before pulling out a hand held missile launcher.\n\n\"Then you certainly got what you were wanting.\"\n\nThen he fired.\n\n\n\nA day later, the world was reset, and would continue again until the end of the next month. All players could rejoin, but I decided not to. I did what I was hoping to, and had no reason to go back. I had my fun and destroyed a world, and should leave future ones be.",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3z0yfm/beyond_the_wall_session_11_of_the_evil_that_lurks/\n***\nWe last left our ‘heroes’ in an interesting position. The gang, minus Freya, had slaughtered several elders of the hamlet of Tywyn while under the strange hypnotic persuasion of the darkstone. Or were they? Freya herself had fallen into a drunken slumber that her family could not wake her from, tumbling for eternity in the Red Dream. We met a lot more sparsely since then, a few short session here and there. I’ve compiled what has happened since into one longer series of notes.\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*  \n\nWhile Freya sleeps in the royal carriage, her family desperately trying to rouse her from such an unnatural slumber, the group convenes in the central square of the hamlet. Four of the elders are dead, killed by the young adventurers. The other four are locked up in the prison, and the group decide they need to question them as they work this situation out, the pull of the darkstone starting to fade from their minds. They question each in succession about what they know about Vito, the strange pale man that seems to be hunting the party. The first two elders are killed after revealing very little, their bodies falling still in the street. The third member, a man named Coldor, is a bit more cooperative, and the group gives him some water and untie him. He doesn’t know much more than the previous two elders, but his brother Colthoar is a farmer and has seen Vito on the outskirts of the hamlet. From what the group gathers, Vito is a powerful bounty hunter or mercenary that rode into town looking for them. He rides a black horse and has black armor, and some of the witnesses describe him as a ‘Black Knight’. Colthoar has a theory that he either recruited or subjugated the wolves with some sort of magic, there was definitely something off about the guy.\n\nAt this time the royal caravan rolls into town, and the King/Queen/guards are aghast at the carnage they find. Ever the charismatic face character, Cal simply describes that there was a conspiracy afoot in Tywyn. Most of the witnesses they talked to claimed the settlement was founded to escape Kingdom rule, so the motive was there. Cal also had Perry draw up a ‘symbol of Vito’ to slip into the bodies, proof that he was the mastermind of some strange force out to slay the royal family. This sated the curious guards for now, who quickly arrested the rest of the (confused) citizens and locked them up. The party then recruited Coldor and Colthoar to create a ‘militia’ to help defend the town against Vito and his conspirators while they hunted down the wolves.\n\nThe three members (Freya is stuck in some deep magical coma as the player could not attend), hunt down a lone wolf. Perry casts her druidic magic that allows her to communicate with such beasts, and asks about the alpha and everything they know about Vito. The alpha agrees to talk, knowing that these kids could help. Vito has cursed the wolves, thus having leverage over them to help. Any that refuse to help or try to flee the area are felled by some foul disease, and the rest are slowly starving as they cannot hunt. The alpha pleads the group to help, but warns them of Vito’s immense powers.\n\nThe group return to the hamlet and inform the king that Vito’s conspiracy in this area is limited and they must move on to the capital of Kirkwall, seat of the throne. The party’s current plan is to find some magical tutor for Cal, thus allowing them all to train hard and overcome Vito. They will also use the threat of ‘Vito-ites’ as cause for taking over towns and infiltrating the security of the king. The long-term goal is to have Freya assume the throne. The royal caravan is once again readied, the the group resume the long march to the capital.\n\nDuring the first leg of the journey they are set upon by six horse-bandits, who run through the slow moving caravan striking at the horses and causing immense chaos. While the group and the guards manage to fend them off, Cal is mortally wounded and is pulled into the royal carriage for healing, and Arrow is almost left behind after he tumbles off of his horse fighting a bandit. The bloodied and beleaguered group pulls into their first rest stop, the mighty fortress of Caer Sena. This place holds the frontiers of the Kingdom against the unincorporated territories, bandits, and roving war parties of goblins. Commander Eahred greats the party, settling everyone in to the small arrangements they have made.\n\nIt is at this time Freya finally stirs, waking from her horrible nightmare. She had been standing atop a hill, watching the capital burn beneath her. A man stood nearby, watching her with a fiendish grin. He stretched out his hand and she awoke. She is not sure if she took it or not. Extremely hungry after being asleep for several days, she ordered her handmaiden to fetch her some food and water. What little stock the fort had was brought to Freya to feast on, thus earning her the ire of the soldiers stationed there. To everyone’s shock, during her ‘feast’ Freya announced that she no longer had any intention of continuing her relationship with Leo, who had stood by her since the attack on Lundenfeld. The distraught young man ran away from the fort, rushing through the woods. Freya decides to try and right two wrongs by heading into the woods to hunt some food for the soldiers, and find Leo. While the latter does not happen, she managed to trap four rabbits, who she gives to al and Sir Barry to skin and treat. While this is happening, Commander Eahred informs the King that the meeting with the goblin ambassador is set to be underway the next day.\n\nEveryone in the party is surprised to hear this, and are told that the two races will be meeting to discuss the events of the past few weeks, attacks on settlements, mines, raids, etc. If there is a war brewing, the King wants to try and stop it. But now he has the threat of Vito and his conspiracy to worry about, as far as he knows. He is unsure if the goblins are in on it, having brokered peace with the humans over a hundred years ago, but wants them to answer for the attack on Lundenfeld.\n\nThe group plot in the dark of the night, arranging for Freya and Cal to sit in on the meeting. Their motives are not totally clear, but the power of the Red Dream leads them to the desires to kill the goblin ambassador. They believe this is all a trick to kill the King and take control, and don’t need the competition. Perry also finds a way to secret herself into the meeting, as Arrow waits outside to provide support.\n\nThe day of the meeting arrives, and the group readies themselves for an event that could surely change the shape of the world...",

        "text": "[Previously](https://redd.it/3zze0p), [our heroes](http://imgur.com/a/GMt9n) had gotten embroiled in a large, sinister plot that was as creepy as it was infuriatingly vague. Some shadowy asshats had overtaken a city and massacred the inhabitants, and now the heroes were here, locked into a big nightmarish place with no hope of rescue! Spooky, right?\n\nRose: \"I draw a giant butt on the wall and set it on fire!\"\n\nWell, the party at least had an idea what they were doing. The shadowy assholes had quite the operation going, and a key part of it was this big stronghold where they were holding the inhabitants and systematically torturing them for lulz/food (they fed on nightmares). This needed to be stopped, and as it so happened, the party was a group of massively powerful assholes weilding magic stuff and itching to use it on someone they hated. Thoth zapped everyone past the main gates of the fortress, Barrel secured the area with a flurry of knives and bombs, and Rose took point to shoot stuff. TokenHuman, who had been revealed last session to be not an actual human at all, contributed by setting EVERYTHING ON FIRE. Including the guards to a large, mysterious door that was barred shut, presumably to keep something nasty insi- oh shit they're opening it.\n\nThe party forted up immediately and slammed a wall into place as the doors flew open, revealing an incredibly blood-spattered ice giant thing. Apparently it had not been very cooperative with the agenda of team Shadowy Assholes, but as the party quickly discovered, it wasn't really on the side of team Ultraviolence For Great Justice, either. Its idea of fun was freezing absolutely goddamn everything and then pulling it apart with its icy claws. So Barrel stepped up and told it that there were a lot of really puny guys further into the castle that mister Murdergiant would probably have fun dismembering.\n\nAnd damn if Barre; didn't get a critical success at just the right moment. Murdergiant was convinced, and the party marched along at a very safe distance, outside of the health-sapping cold that followed mister Murdergiant everywhere. And so the party stumbled into the Asshat Lieutennant, the sinister second-in-command to Count Von Evilguy. As fit the pattern, the Lieutennant was a complete dick, and upon seeing the Murdergiant, directed him to a large warehouse full of undefended prisoners. Barrel rolled against the Lieutennant in a battle of diplomacy, at which point the Murdergiant critted his initiative, made a full attack against the dickish Lietennant, critted again, and turned the evil fuckbag into a large pile of bloody ice chips. After which every OTHER shadowy asshole attacked the Murdergiant, while the party sat back, took potshots at anyone who ran away, and ate a truly impressive amount of popcorn.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of it. With the Lieutennant taken care of, the party had just thrown a huge wrench into Von Evilguy's plans, but they had a pressing issue: They hadn't slept for, like, 14 hours, and they were low on health, spells, and damn near everything else. So Tokenhuman dusted off his spell list, zapped everyone into a pocket dimension, and folks got some sleep. When they returned, things were... different.\n\nThey were in a familiar-looking bar, or more specifically a strip joint, with a whole bunch of familiar sights around them. Apparently Von Evilguy was pretty good at illusions, because this time, he'd brought up nearly every major villain the party had yet faced. There was Sleazeball the dickish summoner, specters of death, a flock of unicorns, Tokenhuman's old crew, the small child that the party had adopted, a crazed aboleth that had to kill once, a giant rust monster, and as the capstone to this whole business, [BETTY THE MOTHERFUCKING ADAMANTINE GOLEM](http://i.imgur.com/tKAzVIx.png). Who was playing bartender. Half the party decided, well, screw it, and went to order drinks. The other half immediately set about trying to find the most spectacular way to murder all of their soon-to-be enemies. They weren't attacking just yet, because the Sleazeball illusion was using the time to go on a long-winded rant, which NOBODY, even the other boss-monsters, was paying attention to.\n\nThe party started off things with Pratena launching a punch so powerful that it blasted the Sleazeball illusion all across the little stage, to polite applause from the rest of the bar patrons. But, sadly, the fight was on. It was long and grueling, with every enemy getting their chance to do something unique- which usually failed spectacularly as Twiddlest lodged a storm of knives in their squishy bits, Thoth metamagic'd them into lumps of charred meat, Rose demonstrated the new Grill setting on her flamey spear, Pratena punched things hard enough to knock them through walls, and Tokenhuman provided much-needed support. They murdered the unicorns, decapitated the phatom grim reaper, shot the aboleth, zapped Tokenhuman's phantom crew, and slapped the little kid with a newspaper. Oh, and they shot the rust monster from all the way across the room and with an entire shield wall of wooden tables intervening, because holy FUCK they were not about to lose their awesome equips this late in the adventure.\n\nAnd finally, Betty stopped polishing its glass, took off its whimsical hat and bow tie, and carefully stepped out of the little gate in the countertop, and proceeded to (politely) smack Pratena through five tables, two support beams, Barrel, and a rather solid-looking wall. Betty was back, and there would be no more fucking around. It had even been upgraded with new legs that were slip resistant, to prevent an easy victory via the Grease spell. Things were looking grim...\n\nSo Tokenhuman zapped it with Reverse Gravity. Betty flew out the ceiling like a wrecking ball duct-taped to a jumbo jet. The party decided that, all things considered, they would rather not be hanging around when it landed.\n\nSo, moving quickly, they charged into the main office of Von Evilguy, where his nefarious plans were being worked on in a tasteful office suite by hundreds of belaugered shadow-assistants, all whining about workman's comp and strict deadlines. Nobody was really all that interested in security (and given the party's level, it would have been a bit futile), and were easily brow-beaten into showing them just what the hell was going on. One assistant pulled back a curtain to reveal on odd, glimmering, oblong object the size of a large dog that occasionally twitched.\n\nA dragon egg. The entire fucking facility was brimming with a bunch of corporate drones trying to hatch dragon eggs. Dragons that had, by all accounts, been dead for all of human history.\n\nThe party had a brief discussion over whether they should steal the eggs, smash the eggs, murder the cubicle workers, or all of the above. Eventually it was decided that, with this development, it was imperative that they find Von Evilguy right the fuck NOW. They charged down the stairs labelled \"EVIL LAIR\" and came into a very deep chamber, glowing with magma. Count Von Evilguy, the villain with the brain of a whiny two-year-old and the power of a demigod, brandished his special dragon egg and immediately launched into a speech about he would attain \"Physical Perfection\" by merging with his hand-chosen dragon hatchling, and lay waste to all living things everywhere.\n\nHalfway through the speech, EVERY SINGLE PARTY MEMBER shot him in the face. At once.\n\nVon Evilguy wasn't just a sorcerous dick, though. He was a creature of spirit energy, and could not be truly killed by mortal weapons! He blasted into nefarious smoke, which began seeping toward the dragon egg-\n\n&gt; THOTH: \"I cast aqueous orb! He's smoke, right? That'll get stuck in the water!\"\n\n&gt; FISHNAUT: \"I zap the orb with lightning! I ZAP EVERYTHING WITH LIGHTNING!\"\n\n&gt; TOKENHUMAN: \"I use my ice magic to freeze the orb!\"\n\n&gt; ROSE: \"I use my flamey fauchard to cut it in half!\"\n\n&gt; DM: \"Oh, gods... The villain is now a chilly, sparking, widely-distributed puddle on the ground. He's still twitching.\"\n\n&gt; PRATENA: \"I dart forward and use Touch Of Idiocy on the goo... HAH! Max damage!\"\n\n&gt; BARREL: \"And I start shoveling the goo into potion vials!\"\n\nAnd thus, Count Von Evilguy, mad sorcerer and fucking idiot, was scraped up into seven vials of extremely grungy water, which Rose promptly brought up to the confused shadowy office workers. There, she offered 500 gold to anyone brave enough to chug one. Meanwhile, in the basement, everyone was giving each other high fives when the dragon egg started to crack... Barrel darted forward, and looked directly into the eyes of a species that had been dead for over two thousand years. He rolled his Handle Animal check... Natural, fucking, twenty.\n\nThe party then set about cleaning up the base, shooing the shadowy accountants out of the bodies of the remaining populace, and appropriating the entire storeroom full of eggs. Everyone grabbed their own dragon, loaded the rest onto a big old cart, and set off for ho- wait, they were forgetting something.\n\nBetty finally came down from her long flight and crashed into a housing development with the force of a meteor. Oh yeah, they still hadn't actually dealt with that. Well, weapons up, once more into the breach...\n\nThey marched on the damaged golem, its horrible landing injuries already melting away in an impressive display of repair magic. Within moments, Betty was back into top condition and ready to start punching bitches-\n\n&gt; TOKENHUMAN: \"Yeah, no. I prepared Reverse Gravity twice today.\"\n\n&gt; DM: \"Welp. Betty soars into the sky like a majestic eagle. Except that the eagle is drunk and is trying to drive an ice-cream truck, and really meant to turn the wheel AWAY from that big ramp.\"\n\n&gt; BARREL: \"I deploy ALL OF MY BOMBS.\"\n\n&gt; DM: \"How many do you have?\"\n\n&gt; BARREL: \"It can only be expressed in scientific notation.\"\n\n&gt; THE REST OF THE PARTY: \"WE PITCH IN ALL OF OUR EXPLOSIVES.\"\n\n&gt; DM: \"...Someone please roll a craft: traps.\"\n\n&gt; BARREL: \"33! After that, I retreat behind this pile of rubble here. Follow me, guys!\"\n\nAnd so, from a safe distance of about 40 feet, the party watched with glee as the unstoppable adamantine golem fell down, down, down and-\n\n&gt; DM: \"So, yeah. Everyone needs to roll a [reflex save vs hiroshima](https://youtu.be/Gxm_qpKh7Jw?t=18s).\"\n\nWhen everyone came to, it was generally decided that 50 feet and a piece of drywall was not sufficient cover for an explosive blast on the level of major earthquakes. At least, mostly. When everyone regained their hearing. And stopped whining about being impaled by shrapnel the size of telephone poles. But on the plus side, nobody could see where the hell Betty was, so it was presumably dead. Also, for some reason, it was snowing. Snowing... flaky, metallic brown stuff.\n\nBetty's head landed with a solid THOMPH in front of Thoth. And despite it all, Betty, STILL, WAS NOT, DEAD. Oh, sure, it would be a few months before it had limbs again, but holy FUCK. Well, there was one way to put an end to that. Rose hefted her adamantine, and newly vorpal, fauchard, ready to put a permanent end to this... Which was when Thoth ducked behind a rock, rolled disguise, and walked out dressed as Count Von Evilguy.\n\n&gt; THOTH: \"Betty! Identify me.\"\n\n&gt; BETTY: \"Identified as owner.\"\n\n&gt; THOTH: \"Guys? New plan.\"\n\nThe party, triumphant and laden with dragon eggs, pilfered loot, and their own personal murder-bot head, marched into the sunset. Or, you know, limped heavily while whining about internal bleeding.\n\nAnd though they had many adventures in the times to come, and many challenges and adversities, it all seemed minor in comparison. They would always remember that moment, the moment they saved the world and shaped history, for better or for worse, by being what they truly were... Absolutely glorious gamebreaking chucklefucks.\n\n***FIN***",

        "text": "**The Adventure**  \n\nUpon waking and entering the ruins the party failed to notice that the were being stalked by a pride of starving mountain lions. The lions surprised the party and attacked. They were easily cut down, and the last one turned to flee, but an arrow from Gylian killed it. Dusting themselves off, Eriden decided the party needed to become more stealthy and cast Pass Without Trace.  \n\nHeading to the old guard tower, the party made it up the stairway to find a land bridge. The footing was treacherous and people kept stepping in a strange crusty residue. Midway across, Gylian stumbled. The falling rocks woke a a huge flock of bats, who swarmed the party. Making a break for it, Eriden got bitten and fell to the ground, and one almost clawed out Gylian's eye.  \n\nRunning for the door, the party made it. Eriden was the first to notice strange movements in the shadows. Before they knew it, they were attacked again by ghosts. Eriden, low on health, was the first to go down. Soon enough he brushed it off and was back in the fight. Gylian sent the last ghost to the planes of the dead and the fight was over.  \n\nSending his mount to the second floor to search the area, it stumbled into a stirge hive. The stirges followed it back to the first floor and were quickly killed. The party took some time to mend their wounds and then continued up the staircase. Eriden hurried ahead to the roof. He noticed a pair of small hands holding on to the ledge, and went back to get his comrades. By the time everyone arrived, the hands were gone, replaced by a grappling hook and a rope. Eriden noticed a small form on the far side of the land bridge, but it was gone before anyone could do anything about it.  \n\nMoving down the stairs, they searched the third floor. Gylian found a magic breastplate and sword. Not wanting to be left out, Eriden went for a leather cloak he saw hanging on the wall. It surprised him as it unfolded and wrapped itself around his head. Blind and suffocating, he mumbled for help. Gylian was able to rip it off and then, in a rain of arrows, Alli and Gylian put it to rest. Feeling the weight of their fights, the party decided to take a long rest and tend their wounds.  \n\nIn the middle of the night, a pack of zombie ogres attacked. Gylian was able to fend off the onslaught for most of the fight, but they finally pushed him out of the doorway. It was no good though. The fallen zombies kept getting up, until Gylian started to cleave them with radiant damage, and Eriden did massive damage to them when they were down. After the fight, the zombies' decomposing corpses littered the stairway and small entrance hall. The party went back to sleep.  \n\nIn the morning, Gylian found a secret compartment. Trying to force it open, he set off a trap, and both he and Eriden were infected with a poison. It rotted their faces. Eriden got the worst though. Gylian was able to cure them both, but the damage was already done. Only time would heal their blemished faces. After triggering the trap and stopping the poison from further damage, Gylian beat the door to splinters and found 5 potions.  \n\nSearching the second floor, the party found no more undead. Eriden put up Pass Without Trace, and the party made it safely across the land bridge. Heading north to the temple, they first searched the outside. Leading up to the temple they saw the bases of many statues. All of them fallen over and decayed with the passage of time. There was a leg here, an hand there. The shattered temple itself was weathered and rough.  \n\nTo the east was a statue of Paladine. To the west a statue of Mishikal. Both lay in crumbling ruins though. It seemed that they did offer a small pocket of undefiled space though. Checking to the north of the temple, Gylian found a small crystal spring. Upon inspecting it, he noticed a water mephit. Becoming curious, he drank his potion of water-breathing and dove in. Seeking the depths, he found a subterranean cave. Throwing caution to the wind, he forged on alone. At the end, he came face to face with a 20 foot snake. She introduced herself as Opalescent, the water naga. The mephits were her helpers.  \n\nGylian resisted two spells and finally let down his guard to allow the naga to read his mind. Sensing no evil motives, she followed him out to meet the rest of his party. Opalescent noticed an unseen spectator and coaxed a small kender out of the shadows. Thanator \"Shroud\" Grave-Eyes, climbed down the cliffside and introduced himself to the party. He was suspicious because the party had taken his grappling hook and rope. When assured that it would be returned, he lightened up. Then started babbling to Alli.  \n\nShroud explained that the valley was still full of spirits. The naga explained that the kender was actually a kender nightstalker, a rare trait that gifted (or cursed) him with the ability to commune with the spirits of the dead. He explained that he was initially drawn to the valley by a strange unheard voice that had been haunting him. He explained that the spirits in the valley are under a curse. The curse bound the ogres to the valley, and unfortunately, over time, the presence of the undead cursed the entire valley. The barrier between the the living world and the spirit world is very thin in some of the places, he explained. It allowed the spirits of the dead to draw power from the otherworld and grow stronger.  \n\nShroud mentioned someone or something called Scuttles, but nobody seemed to understand what he was talking about. The naga gave what information she could, healed Gylian and Eriden's faces and bid the party farewell.  \n\n**Loot**  \n\n* 250 Ancient gold pieces (melted down about 100 gp worth, or possibly of value to a collector).  After Gylian gives some away. 240 pieces are left. (On Gylian)\n\n* 2 Potions of greater healing (4d4+4 HP) (On Gylian)\n* 3 Unchecked potions (On Gylian)\n* 10 +1 Arrows 10 Silver arrows (5 +1 arrows On Gylian, 5 +1 arrows on Alli, * 5 silver arrows on Alli, and 5 silver arrows on Eriden)\n* +1 Breastplate armor (On Gylian)\n* Kiss of the Desert Sky - +1 Shocking Burst Longsword (On Gylian)\n* Leatherbound journal (On Gylian)",

        "text": "Our mission, at first, seemed suicidal. \n\nTo take a town, full of germans riding their powerful tanks, only with infantry. We had two deployment zones, one to the North (A), which led directly to the town, and one to the South (B), across the river along which the town had bewn built. We divided our forces, said our goodbyes, and prayed to whatever gods were listening.\n\nI was deployed on the South bank, and we soon made our way to the ruined bridge that would grant us passage to the town. There was little to no resistance. We thought we may have another shot at this. \n\nThis would not last. Reports came in from up North, saying that the Germans had quickly dispatched five tanks to eliminate them. We listened to their screams, the bombs falling, the cannons roaring. And then, static. Half our company was no more. \n\nAnd those panzers were coming right at us. \n\nThe battle on our side wasn't much easier. Trying to cross the bridge was nigh suicidal, as underequipped as we were, with AA ammo raining down on us from a bridge to our left, enemy snipers decimating our numbers from across the river, and now, tanks spitting hellfire on us. Still, we pushed. And were pushed back. And pushed. And were pushed back. Our side of the river ran red with blood, both german and american. Soon, reinforcements would come to the aid of the germans, and that would mean the end of both the mission and our lives. We fought on, as friend and foe all fell around us, our ears deaf from the explosions. We destroyed the tanks, somehow. Our general had the decency to at least give us some anti-armor. Still, our situation looked grim; we had to storm a fortified position filled with better equipped troops. We pushed.\n\nAnd suddenly, our radio came to life once again. A motorised assault division had come to our aid. They quickly made headway to our left, taking care of the AA position, and turning it against the germans. We pushed, this time with hope we might end up seeing another day. We fought, tooth and nail, as we crossed the river, once and for all, and fortified our position. We pushed further into town, each wave of germans less numerous than before. Our main objetive laid right before our eyes a cathedral atop a hill. And the german reinforcements, barely an hour away. \n\nWe pushed, up the hill, into the cathedral. Inside, a rag tag band of the same germans that not so long ago had seemed terrifying, staring at us like we were the Devil incarnate. We must've looked the part, that's for sure.\n\nThey surrendered, and we set up an ambush for the reinforcements. We made short work of them. Now, it was us with the better position.\n\nNight fell, and we all huddled around a campfire, strange shades dancing aling the walls of the church. We mourned our lost, and felt grateful to be alive. \n\nWe pushed.\n\n--------\n\nSo I took some literary licenses right here to make it more... Interesting. Originally, my character was deployed up North, but since we got blasted to Hell and back, we joined our allies South. I died... Almost 20-30 times, most of the time not even knowing what hit me, much less where it came from. There were no reinforcements coming, only an arbitrary countdown that signaled our defeat, but who would believe that after some time the attackers would just up and leave?\n\nThe rest of them is all true, though. We were getting killed right and left, our reinforcements, the hard push... I must say, I feel quite proud of what me and my teammates accomplished here (well, I helped. Somewhat. I hope). We fought for like an hour to take that damned town.\n\nAlso, this game is really good. A bit grindy at first, but once you learn the ropes and are ready to join the War mode (just... Look it up, it's way too much information to pack here), the game becomes much more interesting. \n\nAlso, rule of thumb, forget about K/D ratios, just go for the objectives, and talk to your teammates.\n\nPSA over! Hope you liked the tale!\n\n\nQuick edit: I'm on my mobile and I just can't figure out how to flair it accordingly. If someone knows how to do it on Baconreader...",

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/42irzd/dnd_5e_what_did_i_get_myself_into_pt_1/)\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\nThat night I made my way to the stables out back. I made sure my knife was secured about me, every step loathing my existence as I drew closer to my destination. I rationalized I hadn’t a choice. That my former caravanner was forcing me- but if I was honest, he wasn’t. I was just too scared of him to say no.\n\nI could sense my companion’s approach. The way he breathed and the way my hair prickled on the back of my neck revealed his ominous presence. I didn’t bother to look, but placed my focus on the view before me. It was dark, a single lantern illuminating the stables.\n\nMy fingers plucked a few chords and softly I whispered, “lujt roqoin.” A flurry of thoughts came to me, which was good. I could sense five beings close by, one of a female which did wonders for my nerves. The most curious of the thoughts that came to mind was the sense of anger. And not just any anger, the kind that seemed beyond the person and portrayed in a form of pain. They couldn’t escape it.\n\nI slowly turned to look at my traveling companion. He stood close by, his robed form and masked face motionless.\n\n“Are you alright?” I asked. Never had I known the war that was waging in his head. A low growl rumbled from deep within. “Do you have a name?” I pestered. There was a hopefulness that somehow I might be able to reach the person inside. I had once seen something human about him, but it was a glimpse similar to a dream. However in that moment, I didn’t doubt that ounce of humanity I once saw. There was much more to the silent, terrifying being.\n\nKim-ar-is, he slowly spoke in my mind. With the strain he put into saying his name, I figured that was more than a victory for me. And with that I stopped while I was ahead and returned to focus on the other thoughts about me.\n\nEach mind that I sensed was there for the same purpose Kimaris and I were there: to answer the scribbled flier. As the two of us drew nigh, we could see a Halfling, a Human, some kind of mouse like folk, and another Human. The second one had an air about him that quickly revealed him to be the one who placed the call. He introduced himself as Bordel, which was true. His thoughts were mingled with worry, but he was being honest so far. Actually I think the biggest relief of the whole situation was the fact there was no malicious intent on anyone’s thoughts. The area was flooded with curiosity, rage, and worry.\n\nBordel withdrew a pipe from his person and asked the group to partake of it. I lifted an eyebrow. Not being a smoker, due to the way I was raised (and a habit I still have no intention of forming) felt slighted that he was requesting of us such an act. There might not have been anything on his fore thoughts to suggest something was amidst, but who was to say the substance wasn’t laced with poisons?\n\nWhen the pipe came to me, I passed it to Kimaris. He too passed it along. We were the only two who had declined and it made me nervous to say the least, yet at the same time, I mentally dared anyone to make a big deal of it. I had Kimaris on my side.\n\n“To those who partook, I know I can trust,” Bordel spoke. I found that condescending considering our refusal to smoke his pipe was hardly a show of character. The Human then walked up to me and Kimaris, pipe in hand. He glanced at my companion before looking at me and saying, “I would really appreciate it if the two of you would take of my pipe.”\n\nI narrowed my eyes a little. “I don’t understand how puffing on a pipe can identify my character to you,” I replied. The man smiled and his mind lit up as he responded, “I just need you to do this one thing for me.”\n\nAll eyes were on me. Every thought curious as to what I would do. Bordel’s mind was calm and inviting. Something in his thoughts suggested that he was extending an invitation and the only way I could obtain it was to partake of the pipe.\n\nWith my brows furrowed I snatched the pipe from the Human’s hands and brought the long stem up to my lips. I hesitated as the thoughts of victory and ‘push over’ played on the group's minds. My body didn’t want to do it either, my lips remaining pursed. I did manage to take the faintest of puffs from the pipe, coughing on the little smoke that entered my lungs. Quickly I passed the vile contraption to Kimaris.\n\n“Thank you,” Bordel said to me, clapping a hand on my shoulder. I felt used. I had just given in to the pressure of the crowd... I had given into the silent pressure of Kimaris. My thoughts darkened with my own disappointment for my inability to stand up for myself.\n\nKimaris’s anger doubled. I looked to him right as he reached out and yanked Bordel up to his face. My companion was at least eight feet tall, and so the Human who had summoned us hung helpless in Kimaris’s grip as he took in a deep, long breath. He then blew the smoke into Bordel’s face before setting him back down.\n\nOur host was undeterred by the aggressiveness of Kimaris. That was good for I worried about his ability to maintain control. The rage his thoughts went into was enough to make anyone in their right mind be afraid. For all I knew, some kind of beat down was soon to take place.\n\nBordel returned to his post and put the pipe into his pack. He then replaced the item with a cup. This wasn’t any ordinary cup. It was made of scales. I didn’t get a chance to catch what else the Human was thinking as he withdrew the object. My concentration broke with the exchange Bordel and Kimaris had and therefore nothing further than dread did I gather. That was what the Human was in need of. Help to dispose of the cup. The magics of it were too great to just hand it off to some other being and numbers were needed for the unknown danger that loomed about a cup of such evil and power. Because of the nature of the cup, we all were warned that no one was to touch it. Only he would carry the burden.\n\nMy head reeled. I was not an adventurer. Never wanted to become one and matters involving evil certainly was not my idea of a good time. It was mildly intriguing how curious the others were. The Halfling, Fernwood being her name, and the Human mercenary, Marcus (we did introduce ourselves at one point), were all for helping despite the lack of possible payout. The mouse folk had the best of senses and literally high tailed it out of there. If only I had remained true to myself and not have let Kimaris’s intimidating presence stilled my tongue, perhaps I would be in another caravan by now moving away from Asura. Instead Bordel looked to me and Kimaris and asked if we would help. My companion spoke for us with a hand on my shoulder and a nod of his head.\n\nAnd so we are to leave in the early morning. I would like to run, but with Kimaris in the corner of the room, I have little choice. It’s moments like this that I desire to call upon Heironious and seek His grace... but chances are I’d be wasting my breath.\n",

        "text": "So this is a tale from not much later in the tale of those bumblefuck adventurers(yes I know it sounds like chucklefuck but I guarantee we are not like the gloriousness that composes [their campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/search?q=author%3AEgo_Dominus&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)). But we decided to set our way into a module for once and they still manage to fill it with fuckery. I am going to try to keep it as spoiler free as possible as I set into my next two tales but for any of you that may be playing/planning to play the out of the abyss/rage of demons module you may want to shy away from these until you get past these events. Anyway getting into background again the party this time is the same with a new addition: Kiki the drow rogue who can’t talk, Verlan the wizard who thinks others are not so smart. Django the ranger who has his own adventuring franchise officially called Deadshot Bounty Hunting and the new guy who was also in Velkenvelve, Wabe the Gnomish bard. Wabe is kind of a power player.\n\nThis tale is not of a break in the game but something so stupid and ridiculous, I thought deserved to be told. I am cutting out a lot of background for the sake of avoiding spoilers, what we need to know for this is that they are in a Kuo toa settlement called Slubloodop, yes that is its name and for any who know of the Kuo toa you know to expect stupid names and much stupider actions and religious zelotry directed literally at a random hagfish that fell onto a broken bust and other insane fish people acts like that. So by the time this tale begins the party is thoroughly done with them and their fishshit and they are helping in a scapegoat plot to make themselves “sacrifices” for a mad ritual to help this city’s opposing factions. Really they are tied with seaweed that breaks easily and fully and openly armed and none of the kuo toa are paying attention to that. So before the ritual really gets under way the bard shouts out claiming that he has learned of he glory of the deep father and it is time he commits himself to piety and has a song prepared for the occasion of his sacrifice. \n\n**Encounter:** The bard begins his song in honor of the kuo toa and their culture which is summarized with “this is kinda cool but yeah not really your gods are weird and your names are stupid so maybe we should just kill you all.” It ends with the line kill you all in which his Mandolin playing becomes an electric power chord which has him cast polymorph on the ranger and turn him into a young black dragon. And then all hell breaks loose. I like to imagine the bard finished it with screaming “goodnight Slubloodop!” then chugging his potion of fire breathing but he just did the latter. Then the wizard casts ice storm, the dragon and bard breathe at the crowd and the party’s npc cleric casts guardian of faith on the area. Hell breaks loose as ice, fire and acid pelt the crowd and an angel rises from the maelstrom and strikes at the archpriest preforming the ritual with a trident, (fitting as she is a fish person). Death fills the plaza but the archpriest survives the onslaught with literally one health, then initiative happens.\n\nHell of a surprise round. \n\nThe wizard stuns the archpriest with hold person and the rogue lands a coup de grace double critting and overkilling her. The result is the crowd gathered around a burned/melting/frozen alter with a dead archpriestess and a series of corpses where a crowd once was. There were some innocents, I don’t think most of them cared. What happened next is spoiler spoiler so I’m gonna end this one here but I will release at least one more tale of their escapades in the underdark soon.\n\nTl;dr a would be ritual turned frozen/acid/burning/radiant fish fry ends with a priestess fillet.\n\n",

How goblins die in this fight:\n1 I nearly cut its head off, not nat 20 but 19\n\n2 Dagger to the back after getting shot in the chest by crossbow\n\n3 I can only describe this as pure RNGESUS Rage at it, Monk had readied an action and when it moved a crossbow bolt made its head explode\n\nAnd for those of you familiar to the campaign there is #4, my least favorite. I captured him after His knee cap got less - Explodey - and interrogated him. FFW know about the mine and such, I decide to bypass it for now and go into town. We go into an Inn where I brandish the goblin and say anyone want a slave 50gp or to kill 25gp (my math was fucked.) No one answers so I Inquire about Guards. None At the moment are stationed here. Cue my eyes turning red with glee. I leave the inn and go into the shop.\nTime for monk shenanigans. He rolls to seduce a barmaid. 18 She takes him to her room. Roll Con save Nat Fucking 1 He gives her aids. Now back to your regular programming.\nI sell supplies and ask if he would aid us in going after the goblins. 2 He says no. I then ask if i can sleep in his shop, he says sure out with the ox. fuckitwhynot.jpg -only been an hour since the cave in game time-\nBack to the monk, and pay attention this is where it gets good. He tries dragging her to the shrine of luck. Roll strength and persuasion. 16 and a 23 Guard and innkeeper help carry her to the shrine then leave. Monk Pushes her onto the shrine and looks around. Sees Bystander. Roll persuasion. 12 She starts running. Monk Gives chase. Tries knocking her out. Rolls to hit 5 Fist goes by her head. She turns, and Monk goes to hit with Quarterstaff. 2 Can't hit too close to her. She runs again, he chases after her and sucker punches her in the back of the head. Now he has 2 sacrifices. Disembowels both, eats hearts and praises Cthulhu. Cue red moon, double lightning.\nBack to me.I buy a donkey and 2 barrels of oil during summoning. Go to barn and sleep. I \"wake\" up and go into the shopkeepers room and slice his throat. I take the wagon of supplies back after Monk finds me. Give Monk the dead body. onemoresacrifice.jpg I tell him to string them up in the streets, now a newly convert to the good church of Cthulhu. He does so, then hops on the wagon. Ride back to Inn. No back doors, just a back room full of alcohol. Cue Demon Soul A.K.A. Me IRL. Find My dead goblin sex slave (I sold Him)\nPlace Barrel of oil next to front door, I make a trail of oil to it, Monk lights oil as I dry my hands. We Ride to town hall as front door blows 3 people into oblivion. the rest burn or blow up with alcohol. I light town hall on fire and burn the mark of the good lord Cthulhu In front of it.\n\nI drive wagon back to the trail mouth. Grab donkey and drag to cave mouth, light barrels of oil on fire then run. Crack appears above cave mouth, donkey is now Houdini, the invisible. Get idea, run back to wagon and drive to cave mouth, put kegs there light them and ride away. Blows up and the entrance crumbles. datxpdoe.jpg Ride off into sunset, sell cart and keep ox. We ride to Neverwinter, where I leave monk with ox outside of town. Monk fucks one while the other watches. Ox Dies From Anal Rape, Monk Melts it with his breath attack, tries anyways, and lightly singes its fur. Rips spine out and uses as club now.\nGuard asks me to Check out strange happenings in Pandaville or whatever, A.K.A. the town we fucked over within 2 hours IRL. Fly there without collecting Monk, he spots and follows, his pet salamander having scored a nat 20 on perception check seen it. it jumps out as he fly's and splats on the ground.\nI know what happened but Guards were sent to investigate, persuade him to give signet ring so i can collect my money. I proceed to fly back to town and collect, when all of a sudden -ambush.- Proceed to decimate the goblins, they run back to crumbled cave mouth start digging. I roll to intimidate while flying above. one tries to attack. Cue Dive attack to the sound of: Rise of The Valkyries. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRU1AJsXN1g )\nThe other seeing his wounded friend get disemboweled digs as i say.\n\nMe and Monk look for Cthulhu. Takes days but we find remote village. Short people, like 6-9 inches. Sea suddenly starts bubbling. Cue Midget darts. Cthulhu rises from the sea, silently he makes some ring. Then 5 stones fly from some place and Form A ring. Monk Realizes whats happening and laughs, I'm clueless.\nMonk runs along a path that hath arisen from the sea. Goes through stargate. Pulls me through. And that is where we ended our first session.\n\nTL;DR First time campaign, Skip plot hook, Summon a god. Blow up town within the hour. Then blow up cave entrance. Reached Level 2. worth it",

        "text": "A big hello to everybody on r/gaming. I will be picking up the tale of our hapless civilians-turned-public enemies, as first seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/42kc8f/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_1/. Last we left off, the group had been escorted to a hidden cave by Ghost, their erstwhile protector. Having been injected with some sort of fluid and told that Ghost would come back for them in a month, this band of luckless scapegoats had little choice but to settle in. \n\nOn second glance, this underground chamber was larger than it had appeared. While certainly claustrophobic, the room was big enough for any of the group to move around comfortably. The four beds, though basic, were comfortable enough and the chemical toilet was far enough away from their 'living quarters' that the stench managed to be quite manageable. Last, but certainly not least, was the crude well carved into the stone: A reliable source of clean water. All in all, this place seemed like paradise for any survival nut or wilderness junkie. \n\nA fact that was promptly ignored by nearly everyone inside. Hautangi, Nellie and Poindexter had never been without access to the Matrix for so long before; all of the digital glories of social media, modern comforts and cat pictures were denied to them. There would be no sports scores, no pre-ordered alcohol arriving at their door step. They didn't even have any way of determining what was going on with the wider world: Was anyone looking for them? Did someone know what had happened? \n\nLeilani, a veteran of living rough, simply rolled her eyes and started to ration out their food reserves. To her surprise, there were more than enough soy-packs to last them until the apocalypse arrived (Werewolf or otherwise). There was even a great diversity in terms of flavors, though that really meant color the paste was when it wormed out of the packet. While everyone else started contemplating exactly what had happened, the veterinarian helped herself to a nutritious and bland meal. There was even in-dinner entertainment as the tech-deprived trio began bickering among themselves, an odd arrangement as Hautangi was large enough be considered a small domicile. While Poindexter may have been cautious, Nellie showed no such restraint: She was quite content to shove the large Maori, repaying his ire in kind.\n\nDay turned to night with a procession of arguing to accompany it. Leilani took to bed before the others, her amusement quickly evaporating into irritation. The bickering continued for sometime before exhaustion kicked in, the events of this week taking their toll on the squabblers. Each of them turned in, confused and a little bit frightened of what the future may bring. At least the beds were comfortable. The land of dreams welcomed them, showing them images of what could have been.\n\nPoindexter, Hautangi and Nellie were all rather rudely awakened by the sound of a thrashing body. When a light was finally brought forth, they found the insensate form of Leilani currently experiencing some sort of violent seizure. Limbs flailed through the air, slamming into everything and anything within reach. Her eyes had rolled back in her head and her jaw was spasming as wildly as the rest of her.\n\nHer skin had also become gelatinous. Like something out of a well-animated horror trid, Leilani's flesh had turned the consistency of jelly and the colour of rotten eggs. While none of her had sloughed off, it seemed like an inevitable consequence of her full-body thrashing. The recently awoken stood still, frozen by these events as they transpired. It was only after Leilani cracked her cranium against the aluminum frame of her bed that they reacted.\n\n\"What the fucking fuck is wrong with her fucking skin!?\" As eloquent as ever, Hautangi held the small lantern high and backed away. Nellie lurched forward, trying to clear everything away from the woman while Poindexter just stared in shock. It was only Nellie's scream for assistance that broke his stupor, the pudgy taxi-driver lumbering forward to help. Between the two of them, they managed to shove aside everything surrounding Leilani. At the very least, she wouldn't be able to harm herself on anything other than the stone floor. Everyone watched in horror as Leilani, the only one of them with any real medical experience, slipped into a deep coma. \n\nThe next week passed agonizingly slowly. The trio took on a rotating shift for them to look after Leilani, providing her with water to replenish the immense amount of sweat that she exuded. One of the others would sleep during the day and then take over in the evening. Whoever was left would do whatever they wanted to. Due to the lack of any real options, they began exercise. Hautangi was the most focused, forcing his body through a myriad of strength building exercises while Nellie continued to hone her athletic body with some vigorous yoga. Poindexter...actually, he tried to avoid doing as much as possible but ended up going along with it out of sheer boredom. \n\nMore and more time passed, with the hope of salvation growing dimmer with each minute. Days turned to weeks turned to months. Finally, Leilani awakened. Her skin had been steadily growing firmer, the color returning to what it ha been previously. The copious amounts of sweat, enough for a miniature waterfall, had finally stopped running from Leilani's form. Her body finally resuming it's normal appearance, the veterinarian opened her eyes to a dim light and the sound of battle cries. \n\nWait, what?\n\nAs the groggy human woman discovered when she sat up, things had gone from bad to worse. Poindexter and Hautangi were trying to fashion a battering ram from the flimsy aluminum frames of their beds, ignorant or ignoring the uselessness of their creation. Nellie had forced her bed, as well as Leilani's, into a barricade between her and the men. She had painted her own face with 'tribal war marks', which Leilani soon discovered to be re-purposed soy-paste. The event planner had declared war on the aspiring engineers, decrying them for their treatment of her. They, in turn, had threatened to leave her here once they broke free of their stony cage. Not even the assistance of 'Pillowa', one of their pillows now covered in soy-paste and inducted into Nellie's 'tribe', could even the odds.\n\n\"How long was I out!?\" Leilani was incredulous. She had remembered going to sleep and then nothing except for pain. Activity in the cave ceased. There was no noise, not even breathing, as they stared at her. \n\n\"About a month.\" Poindexter admitted, fidgeting with the wire he had scavenged from their now shattered lamp. It was being used to strap the frames together, something he had been extremely proud of before. Leilani scoffed, unsure if he was being sincere. After minutes passed without any other response, the formerly comatose woman shook her head.\n\n\"It took one month in a cave, with people you don't like, for you guys to go all caveman? What the fuck is wrong with you people?\" Her accusations finally roused them, a chorus of indignant threats being hurled around. Blame was shifted from one to another, with fingers being pointed and rude names given. Hautangi was sick of all of this. He wanted to go home, have a cold beer and watch the football. No more cave, no more Ghost and no more stupid coma people with melting skin. He wanted out, now. \n\nIt was with this thought in mind that he hefted the 'battering ram' over his shoulder and charged at the door. Poindexter barely had time to stumble aside; the bellowed battle cry was his only warning. The three of them watched as the tattooed Maori barreled through the many empty soy-packs, trampling them under-foot. It was with some amusement that they also watched him bounce off of the triple-reinforced plasteel door. \n\nAny and all entertain that they may have derived from this faded quickly as the sound of gears grinding filled the air. There was a hydraulic hiss and the door slowly began to open, the dull glow of moonlight filtering inside. A wave of air buffeted them, the scent of rain and nature thick in their noses. The four of them stared, hoping beyond hope that this nightmare was over; that someone had discovered where that madman had stashed them. Salvation was here! They had been rescued and could go home, returning to live their lives once more.\n\nWhat they got was Ghost sniggering at Hautangi, still prone on the floor with what could be generously called a make-shift ram beside him. The hat-wearing truck driver stepped inside, stopping just before Hautangi to survey the cave.\n\n\"You lot certainly know how to throw a party. Didn't even clean up after yourselves.\" He shook his head in faux annoyance, a small smile still clear on his face. \"I reckon that you're probably fed up with this cave, eh? How about we head somewhere a little more...spacious?\" The group had something of a dilemma to face here: While they certainly wanted out of this natural prison, they really didn't want to go with the man who had put them in here to begin with. It was almost as if Ghost sensed their hesitation, folding his arms across his chest and leaning against the cave wall. \n\n\"Tell you what. I'll leave you a comm-link so you can have a look at how things are going out there. After that, you can decided what you're doing. You've got two options there: Come with me or head on home.\" The four were incredulous. Why would they ever go with him? His response was an enigmatic smile, handing them the promised comm-link. It was rigged so that they could only receive data and none of them were skilled enough with electronics to change that; it didn't matter. This was the first glimpse into the wider world, the wireless web of information that connected everyone. Disregarding Hautangi's request for sports stats, the others sought out any news on Ohakuri Dam. They did not have to go far, and what they found made their hearts drop into their feet. \n\nThey had been identified as the perpetrators behind a series of terrorist attacks, culminating in the destruction of Ohakuri Dam and the annihilation of the town beneath it. Their names had become public knowledge, reviled by all of New Zealand and beyond. The New Zealand government, Interpol and several other international intelligence agencies were orchestrating a man-hunt for them. In the past month, they had shot up the Most Wanted List until they attained the dubious honor of being number one. In short? Everything that they had done, everything they had achieved and any life goals they had were now gone. Their lives were over.\n\nA pervasive silence reigned over the group. Even Hautangi was quiet, his typically obnoxious personality reeling from this new knowledge. Broken looks were exchanged, the full extent of their circumstances finally hitting each of them: Poindexter collapsed on the ground, Hautangi started pacing angrily, Leilani muttered darkly under her breath and Nellie exploded into a furious rant. Even Ghost seemed impressed by the sheer breadth of rage instilled within every word, insults spilling forth that had never before seen the light of day. Sadly, even Nellie couldn't maintain that level of anger, though not for lack of trying. Once she had exhausted herself, Ghost stepped forward. \n\n\"It's a shit situation you've found yourselves in. Not gonna lie, you're in for an even worse time. You want to go your own ways, that's fine by me. You'll be dead or falsely imprisoned within a day.\" Leilani snapped first, an uncharacteristic anger to her voice.\n\n\"Get to the fucking point, Ghost.\" The elusive asshole acquiesced. \n\n\"Come with me. I can get you stashed somewhere safe. You can learn to stop being goddamn victims and start getting even. It won't be easy and it might just fucking kill you...but it's a chance.\" He shrugged, slipping back out of the cave. \"I'll let you talk it over.\"\n\nThe conversation was over before it began. There were no alternatives that didn't involve them being in jail or in a grave. It was a small, bitter pleasure for the group that Ghost seemed surprised about their quick arrival. They silently embarked the van outside, sliding inside it's metal confines. Ghost smiled to himself, settling into the drivers seat. As he set off, Poindexter hesitantly spoke up.\n\n\"Just one thing? Can we not have any more caves, please?\" Ghost laughed, pulling away from the one-time safe haven and sanity sink.\n\n\"No promises, Kid.\"",

        "text": "The meeting room has been decorated since I saw it last; two giant serpentine statues made of solid gold linger around Klaus' chair, trophies from the Righteous Path.\n \n\"You know sir if we don't sell the treasures, it will be almost pointless ever obtaining them.\"\n \n\"Lighten up Kaleb.  We can afford to take just one thing as a luxury.\"  Klaus beams.  You have no idea what we can and can't afford.\n \nWe all sit down and discuss what we want to do now our adventure has come to an end.  Court insists that he be allowed to train up his own personal regimen, so that a mutiny will never go unchecked again.  I'm more than inclined to agree.\n \n\"Do you think we could take the Righteous Path?\"  Odette interjects, changing the subject.\n \nI raise an eyebrow.  \"You mean with it being a cracked-in-half, demolished, old relic?\"\n \n\"The Righteous Path...\" Zez speaks up, sorrow welling in her voice.  \"It's sad.  Very sad.\"\n \n\"We can make it happy?\"  Odette smiles optimistically.\n \nZez shakes her head.  \"I don't think we can.\"  Zez's eyes puff up like a helpless baby animal.\n \n\"We already have the means to destroy it.\"  I suggest.  \"It seems... like it would be the kind thing to do.\"  It would mean going back on ourselves, but we can afford the time.  I may not understand, but Zez's attachments to the machine spirits is one of the reasons she is such a capable Explorator.  If she never puts this to rest, it could affect her performance.\n \n\"I like the sound of fireworks.\"  Klaus adds in a somewhat untactful manner.\n \n\"Before we leave I would like to go and speak to our new Captain.\" I point out.  \"If we are going to have a successful relationship we need to understand each other.\"  He also isn't the type of man I want to unwittingly cross.  \"I think we should go together Zez.  That way you can see what can be done for their ships, or at the very least help them make it to our next destination.\"  Zez nods in approval.\n \nAfter we finish up Zez and I excuse ourselves, making our way to Khan's newly captured ship.  The Oathsworn gather around, escorting us over, as we travel through the Teleportarium. \n \nThe corpses of the previous crew litter the halls, each with their own grotesque story, revealing the cause of their untimely demise.  Why haven't these been cleared up yet?  The sight of it makes me wretch, as I instinctively look away and hold the wall for support.\n \nI take a moment to compose myself.  While I have no personal qualms in dispatching of my enemies, there is something about seeing this many slaughtered in such a violent and dismissive way that leaves me sick.  A rare fleeting moment that reminds me of my own humanity.\n \nOnce I've pulled myself together we venture on, walking to the bridge.  It is considerably different from our own, even without the blood covering every available surface.  From the top of the deck looking down over the controls Khan sticks out, surveying his new realm, while his crew begin the cleaning process.  His eyes sweep over us, face contorting to show teeth as he makes his way over.\n \nIf I had to guess, I'd say he was trying to smile.\n \nZez, decidedly unnerved by Khan's odd choice of expression scurries away to enquire over ship repairs, leaving me to face him alone.\n \n\"Winguard I presume?\"  His voice is cool and monotone, without a trace of feeling.\n \nWhile I'm quite sure it wasn't Klaus who gave this man my name, I am quite pleased to hear that our new Captain took the time to learn it regardless.  \"Yes, and you are Khan.  Is there a last name?\"  He shakes his head.  \"Then it's a pleasure Khan.  I believe we have much to discuss.\"\n \nKhan nods.  \"What you have to say you can say in front of my people.\"  I look around the room, as the crew start to clear blood from their monitors and kick the corpses into piles.  \"But I can see this distracts you.  This time we can move.\"  He walks off the bridge as I trail behind, thankful for the change of scenery.  He takes me to no room in particular, as we stumble upon an empty petty officer's quarters.  The room is plain with minimal furnishings, Khan pulling the one chair in the room in front of him as he perches on the edge of the bed facing the door.\n \nHe invites me to sit.  \"I have to say,\" I begin, taking the chair, \"I'm quite curious about your origins.\"  Where he came from, how he came to be on the Righteous Path - answers that would lead to a better understanding.\n\n“My people are from a long bygone age.  We were engineered by the inhabitants of the planet, for a long forgotten war.  We dispatched our enemies with ease, and when we grew bored, we murdered our creators too.  Once we had no one left to kill, we used our old master’s technology to enter cryosleep, hoping that when we woke we would find a time more suiting to our nature.”  He pauses, making sure I follow.  “The Rogue Trader of the Righteous Path found us, therefore we became his cargo.”  His tone doesn’t change as he recounts his story.  There is no joy or disdain in any of it, just a list of facts.  As I pick up on this, Khan explains.  “My people, we are not human.  We do not ‘feel’ as you do.  In peace, we grow restless; we do not have the hearts for civility or politics.  Our way is more simple, more… primal.”  He searches for the word.  I’m not entirely sure it can even be called that.\n\nThese people are unfeeling, dangerous, killing-machines… what an army to have at our disposal.  Providing we can keep them ‘entertained’.\n\n“Due to cryosleep,” Khan continues, “we have missed many things.  This ‘Empire’ is new to us.  Should I assume that ‘the Emperor’ is this time’s major religion?”\n\n...he doesn’t know about *the Emperor*?  Or The Imperium of Man?\n\nHow?\n\nUnless…\n\n“What…” I catch myself stammering and clear my throat.  “What year did you freeze?”\n\n“I see you are astounded.”  You could call it that.  “This is why I wanted to speak with you.  The last year I can recall is 2515.”\n\nI stare at Khan so intently I feel I could burn a hole right through him.  2515… though mind-boggling, it’s not completely impossible.  I have read much on our history; in the times prior to the Emperor, while there is very little on the subject, it is fairly well established that humanity was scattered across the expanses of space.  Primitive warp travel existed but man was splintered, cut off from one another.  It was the Emperor who connected him again.  Could it be that Khan’s world was simply never rediscovered?\n\nThe Koronos Expanse was only found a few thousand years ago, well after the Emperor’s time.  It is plausible that what the Righteous Path discovered was a planet, long cut off from civilisation, populated with the murderous creations of an archaic society.  They then did what all Rogue Trader’s do; stole everything of use and purged the rest.\n\nThis… is more than I expected.\n\nI remove my glasses, pulling out a cloth from my sleeve to clean them, finding myself chuckling in response to this revelation.  “Then I imagine you will find a great deal has changed.  Since it is the fortieth millennium, not the second.”\n\n“Has really been that long…”  His eyes seem to glass over, his mind wandering.\n\n“I’m going to be completely frank with you Khan.”  I position my glasses back on my face, carefully pressing them onto the bridge of my nose.  “If you said what you just did to anyone else, you may find yourself tried as a heretic.”  I chose my words carefully.  “There is no disputing the Emperor’s greatness.  I understand that this is… difficult for you,” I say thinking back to his professed inability to be diplomatic, “but I urge you to at least pay him lip service in front of others.”\n\n“I suppose I could teach my people the words of this doctrine.”  He flatly agrees.\n\n“Thank you.”  I replace my handkerchief back in my sleeve, locking my fingers together resting in my lap.  “I would however like for you to be honest with me Khan.  I do believe we can help each other greatly.  If you are up front with me, then I will be the same for you.”  This is a man who does not play games.  If this is the case, then I think it would be possible for me to be open with certain information, within reason of course.\n\n“Then I require access to your Library.  Also this ship with require alterations to be fit for myself and my crew.”\n\n“Consider it done.”  I pull out my data slate.  “Just tell me what you need.”  Khan lists all the features that he wants to replace.  In short, he wants to turn this from a trade vessel into a warship.  When we get to Footfall, we will see how much we can do.  Until then, I will have to think on where to send his crew to get their fill for violence once they have the means to fly.\n\nAs we rise to leave, something crosses my mind.  “One more thing, I have a small request of your crew.”\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/406jtc/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_17/) | Next | Last",

Urgaan had just kicked down the door to the sorcerer's chambers and then inexplicably disappeared because his player is no longer a part of this campaign. In his place stood Synryn the gnome cleric and Frilborin the half elf rogue/swashbuckler. A fight then ensued in which Gimmdren nearly died. After killing the sorcerer and realizing he is not Ianxidor, the part began to loot the room. Gylwynn, being a hoarder, took the sorcerer's robe and put it on, and took each all 4 scimitars from the skeletons to add to her oversized collection of weaponry.\n\nOn the way back to town the party killed 8 goblins, each carrying a javelin and a morningstar, which Gylwynn picked up and put on her belt, at this point she's basically wearing a skirt made of weapons, on top of her stolen robe, on top of her armor.\n\nUpon arriving in town the party heard a man shouting about his \"genuine cure all medicine that isn't snake oil at all\" and how it was made with \"eleven magical herbs and spices\". A crowd was gathering around him. The party called him out as a fraud and he offered a free sip to show the medicine was genuine. Gylwynn took his offer and drank some of the potion. But then, Synryn used his knowledge of alchemy to find out that the potion was made from a mushroom known as Gyion's Cap, which induced random teleportation in anyone who eats it.\n\nMeanwhile Gylwynn leaves to sell some things at a shop and the rest of the party sends Frilborinn after her to warn her about the potion's effects. After catching up with Gylwynn, Frilborinn tells her about the effects of Gyion's cap, and he ties himself to her in hopes of being teleported with her when it happens. Later, while selling a few items, Gylwynn and Frilborinn are teleported to a stone room where there  are two nobles and the bartender from the Dancing Kobold tavern.\n\nMeanwhile, Gimmdren and Synryn are accusing the con artist of poisoning Gylwynn. The con artist says that if he doesn't believe him, they can test the contents of the potion in the alchemy lab in the back of Synryn's wagon, which he had mentioned earlier. Synryn accepts the offer and the crowd comes to watch. Synryn finds that the potion is in fact made from Gyion's cap, but when he turns around to present his discovery, the con artist is gone, and in his place is a different man wearing the same clothes. After a bit of argument with the man, Gimmdren grapples him successfully, but guards see and come to break up the fight.\n\nSynryn decides to bullshit his way out of this situation and say that Gimmdren was just \"putting his hand on the man's shoulder\" and \"asking him questions very persuasively\" and rolls a diplomacy check... and rolls an natural 1. He then proceeds to spew various insults at the guard and question the faithfulness of his mother. The guard then attacks him but is held back by another guard, who then tries to arrest the two for assaulting the man in the crowd more peacefully than the first guard. Synryn then decides he will prove that the man is actually the con artist in disguise by casting zone of truth and asking him. The man admits he is the con artist and did poison Gylwynn. The man then begins admitting all of his secrets, including but not limited to, his crippling fear of dogs, his middle name being Pidlick and his insecurity about his height before breaking down in tears. The guards then arrest both the con artist, Synryn and Gimmdren.\n\nEdit: Paragraphs",

        "text": "**Nephian date November 14, 1115 - Mind if I drop in?**\n\nI was quite enjoying traveling around this world. It has been nearly three months since I left left home and I've seen much.  The oceans here are different than the ones I remember at home. The water is warmer and slightly less salty. I saw quite a few interesting looking fish in the reefs around the coasts of Kaiser. I feel bad as Helia is unable to join me on my underwater adventures. She does have her own world in the sky to enjoy. It is quite unusual when you think about it. A creature of the air and a creature of the water forming such a bond. I wished that one day I could fly in the sky beside her. My wish will soon come true, although not the way I imagined it. \n\nI had seen quite a bit of the world in those three months. Sledging down the slopes of Easthaven was fun. The locals were quite friendly to me and the kids were all wondering what exactly they were looking at. I suppose they don't get many Merfolk in those parts.\n\nThe walled city of Garrison was another interesting stop. I wanted to go visit the strange library Dantalya told me about, but they didn't want to let me in.. Something about a membership crystal and how they were out. While there I also visited the orphanage/temple and offered to help. I'm sure the kids quite enjoyed the performance that evening and the temple was left with a decent sum in donations. I set out towards the ocean the next day. Just as I jumped in the water another portal opened, pulling us through.\n\nWe found our selves high in the air somewhere, dropping fast towards the ground. Quite a few people were already there, falling, screaming, panicking. There was also man holding on to a huge dragon's foot. I recognized him from Dantalya's tales as the Chronicler. He was yelling out orders, trying to get people to calm down and gather up together. \"Looks like your wish came true!\", I heard Helia's voice in my head as she flew around me. \"Yes.. But I didn't imagine it like this...\". I looked around and saw a scared looking guy with short, curly brown hair flapping his hands madly in an attempt to fly. \"Lets try to help them. He looks like he's about to lose his mind. Anyway, how hard can swimming in the sky be?\". It turns out its not that simple, but with Helia's help I managed to reach him. It took a bit of convincing for him to calm down and grab onto me. As I was dragging him towards the Chronicler I noticed a few more people had dropped in, including Amalas, a tall guy with brown hair and eyes and a few scars. He was from the village near the forest.\n\nHe was struggling to control him self also so we helped him next. As Helia brought him one end of the rope the others had already formed a chain and were swinging around to grab a thiefling and a lady with a dragon tail. The former seemed familiar but I didn't have time to think about it then. I grabbed onto her and together we reeled Amalas in closer. The Chronicler asked Nephia to help for the third time now and the world went dark. Then we were on the ground, back home in Kaiser.\n\nI finally had time to take a closer look at my new-found companions. There was Ella, the tall half-dragon woman Dantalya had told me was Titania's daughter. Near her sat a thiefling woman with long, white hair and quite a mean look. But there was something about her eyes that suggested there is more to her than she lets on. Near her sat a large praying mantis, presumably her companion.\n\nOn the other end, near the water there stood a tall, dark-haired man with bronze skin. I remember he was surprisingly calm during the fall. Two sharp blades rested on his hip. Must be some sort of a soldier, I thought. Near him was a man dressed in a plague doctor's outfit, including the creepy bird mask. I noticed quite a few insects gathering around him and Helia commented that she'll never go hungry with him around. I wonder what she meant. \n\nStanding alone was another man who looked like he has seen better days. He had dark hair and was dressed in worn out clothes. The sole of one of his boots was about to come off. His bow and sword also looked also like they had seen better days. I just hope they don't break when he needs them most. \n\nEveryone was quite exhausted from the ordeal so we decided to rest for a bit, before heading to the village of Perkūnkiemis where we would meet the Driller. Once we got to town the ground started to tremble and from around the corner strode a Dragon! A great big one too! Luckily he focused on the Chronicler. Psy, the curly haired guy threw some rocks at it and others tried to shoot at it or hit it with a sword to no real effect. The Driller came out of her house and told us to hurry inside. Everyone started frantically running towards the house. A few of them were quite concerned about how I'll make it there, but I have ways of getting around quickly when I need to. Staz showed up too and started throwing spells at it, but it didn't seem to care much. Before I went into the house I saw the Chronicler imprisoning it in a strange spell.\n\nOnce inside the Chronicler told us about the dragon and how nothing could harm it and that bad things would happen. He told us that Nephia has summoned us here to fix it. We couldn't even handle the dragon outside! How does he expect us to handle the big dragon that even him couldn't hurt? I suppose we'll find out...\n\nThe dinner afterwards was interesting.. The Driller went to fetch a woman called Arellia. She has an.. interesting approach to cooking. She lobbed a fireball at the turkey, cooking it in an instant. The poor guy sitting beside me was caught in the blast too, which didn't help his already crumbling clothes. I am about to head to sleep now. It feels like it'll be a long day tomorrow.\n",
