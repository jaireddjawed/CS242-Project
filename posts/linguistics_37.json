Of course, I've heard the stereotypical gay voice, which is often more nasal. \n\nIs this dialect a newer development, considering the growing acceptance of homosexuality around the world, or did this exist for long before? \n\nAdditionally, does this dialect exist in such a pronounced manner in languages other than English?

This is a track where, for our major electives, one can choose electives beyond those of \"traditional\" and gets more involved in computational linguistics.  There are courses such as Natural Language Processing, Scripting Tools for Text Analysis, Speech Processing, etc.  Recently, I've received an email from a professor that he has been granted enough funding for his research project to support 2 paid undergraduate research assistants.  The application process is pretty informal, and the requirements are below:  \n\n\"\nIf you are interested in this opportunity, please carefully review this information and then contact me with your questions.  \n\nTo apply, you must submit a *brief* letter describing: \n\n1. Your research and/or career plans (all interested students are encouraged to apply; however, for paid positions, priority is given to students with an interest in language engineering);\n\n\n2. Your need for financial support;\n\n\n3. Your contribution to the cultural, geographic, professional or economic diversity at Montclair State University and in the field of linguistics (all interested students are encouraged to apply; however, NSF is particularly interested in supporting students from populations that are underrepresented in STEM)\n\"\n\nThis may not be the right place to post this, but I would really appreciate another pair of eyes with a specialty in linguistics, and more specifically, linguistic academia to look over my letter/application.  This is something I really, really want and would like to do everything I can to try to obtain.  I'm hoping the competition won't be too fierce since it's so informal, but I'm not taking any chances.  I really want this professor to look at my application and be like \"wow, I really want this guy working for me.\"\n\nIf any of you could look over my letter and leave a comment on reddit or a critique/suggestion on reddit, then I would be eternally grateful.\n\nIf this isn't the right place for this, then feel free to take down this post.  I'm just don't know that many people that well acquainted with academia and research applications. \n\nLink:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPWaQ1t7KeEnbogdDhPfAPFP8uD8T4PPYDihv8qLhRE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPWaQ1t7KeEnbogdDhPfAPFP8uD8T4PPYDihv8qLhRE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThis is my first attempt at securing such a research position, so feel free to tell me if I've erred in the formatting or general structure/style of this letter.",

The speaker basically \"phasified\" the segment \"Anthony and my\", and since with several nouns we usually just move the possessive to the last one in casual speech. What surprised me what that this tendency is strong enough to basically roll over the fact that \"my\" is already a possessive pronoun and adding an -s is a bit bizarre. On the other hand, this must be common enough that I almost didn't notice it. I don't think I would say it myself, but it must be common enough that it almost didn't make a blip on my radar. ",

My top teeth meet the inside of my bottom lip in a similar way to the /v/ sound. I have never thought anything about this is unusual. Here is a video of it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71SkO81jcAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71SkO81jcAg) I have also taught this in my class with varying degrees of success.

When I try to teach this, I instinctively when to my teeth example. I did some research about this, the internet told me that the /r/ sound isn't a labio-dental sound, but an alveolar sound. \n\nI have two questions:\n\n* Are there various ways to say /r/ or am I just wrong/deluded?\n* Do you know of any tricks or techniques to better demonstrate and teach this sound (and other sounds generally)?\n\nPlease pardon my lack of technical terms.",

I was under the impression, after viewing several consonant charts, that the L would be clear, as in Swedish or Spanish. However, what I'm hearing is perhaps some allophonic variation.\n\nIn a word like \"tuuli,\" pronounced /ˈtuːli/, the L hear is very clear with no hint of velarization. In contrast, in a word like \"koetella,\" pronounced /ˈkoetelːɑ/, the L seems much more velarized. So the only hypothesis I can make here is that, as in many languages such as Turkish or Russian, the vowel following the L determines the velarization, i.e. front vowels keep the L clear and back vowels darken it. Does anyone else find this so?\n\nWould anyone else care to share their own opinions/findings on this? I'd really love to know.",

        "text": "A couple years back I spent a year in Liberia working on a development project, both in the capital and out in the bush, and for a language nerd my experiences with Liberian English were fascinating.\n\nFor the folks in this sub not familiar, Liberia was founded not by the US government, but by a US NGO in the early 1800s that wanted to find a place to resettle African-American (and Canadian and Caribbean) Freemen as well as intercepted people off slave ships. Several colonies were founded on the coast of what is now Liberia and the settlers provided tools and supplies. Influenced by American plantation society they conquered nearby indigenous African tribes and made themselves rulers of the region. The primacy of the \"Congo people\" (\"returnee\" Africans) was to hold until the 1980s when indigenous Liberians rose up and sparked decades of civil war.\n\nI arrived in Liberia pretty unprepared; I vaguely knew they spoke their own version of English, but assumed it wouldn't be any more confusing then say Jamaican Patois on reggae tracks. My first day there I went to buy a SIM for my phone, and the woman at the desk announced \"kah finis o\" and I was baffled until my coworkers explained she meant \"(SIM) cards are finished, oh!\" Pretty quickly I realized I was going to need to bone up. Fortunately a colleague had a textbook written for aid workers, and I quickly learned that the features of Liberian English aren't \"bad English\" but are based on a complex web of influences from 19th century American and British English as well as local Niger-Congo languages. The \"o\" for example is a common emphatic/declarative expression in NC languages, vaguely similar to an exclamation point, basically indicating \"I have made my firm statement.\"\n\nI can fill in the thread later with examples, and answer questions from my (amateur) perspective, but I'll highlight a few features here and pose a few questions:\n\n**Terminal consonants:** the textbook was great in emphasizing that the tendency to drop consonants from the ends of English words isn't a corruption, but rather the application of Niger-Congo consonant-vowel phonemics. The same way the Japanese incorporated the English \"drama\" as \"dorama\" applies: the locals had an abiding sense that words should end in a vowel, thus \"bread\" becomes \"breh\" and \"call\" becomes \"cah\".\n\nThe question I never found a clear answer to: are English words with the terminal vowel removed totally indistinguishable, or is there an \"implied consonant\" that flavors the last syllable? That is, in a blind test, would Liberians note any difference between \"phone\" and \"foam\" or are they absolutely identical \"foh\" without context?\n\n**Double negation**: Americans are taught that \"I don't got no\" is low class and incorrect because it doubles a negative and makes it a positive. Liberians carry that even \\*further\\* than American English. So one day early on I went and asked a fruit seller \"my mah, you ave no banana?\" and he replies \"yes\". It took me a second to realize that he meant \"yes, I don't\" where an American/Brit would say \"no, I don't\". And then I realized we were basically recreating the 1923 vaudeville song \"Yes! We Have No Bananas.\"\n\n**Either/or clauses**: this one drove me insane. Apparently Niger-Congo languages lack an either/or, so even in English, Liberians don't understand that structure. So if I asked an employee \"De boss carry de pekin, o he go wih Melvin?\" (did the boss take the kid with him, or did he go with Melvin?) my staff would be absolutely baffled. And the first time I asked a contractor \"You wan coffee, o tea, o wata?\" and he looked at me askance and said \"rice?\"\n\nQuestion: given a language with no either/or structure, how do you ask equivalent questions? I tried a few things like asking questions in sequence \"You wan coffee? You wan tea? You wan wata?\" but even that seemed confusing, so the best I could do was just ask individual questions and eliminate one-by-one. Is there any more graceful way to do it?\n\nIn whatever case, over the course of a year I went from not being to understand people on the street to being reasonably proficient. I quickly found that despite exposure to media many Liberians had trouble understanding \"Sirese\" (white English), and by speaking Liberian English I could not only build up rapport and local cred, but also just improve simple understanding. It took me one try at the corner shop asking \"Five pieces of bread please\" getting a baffled look and resorting to \"I beh you o, fih breh\" and getting what I wanted.\n\nSo those are a few examples of distinctive features of Liberian English, and few questions, and I have more examples and stories, maybe a few answers to your questions, and some questions of my own if folks are into it. I teh you tanks, o!",

It’s not really a language game per se in the way Pig Latin is, but essentially, you take a noun, and then you repeat it but with the first sound swapped for another. This rhyming phrase then has the meaning “noun and other things like it”. \n\nThe example that was pointed out to me by my friend is “picnic-shicnic”, where someone was being derisive about the idea of wasting time with things like picnics. I’ve also heard it used in “jogging-wogging”, in the context of “I stay healthy, I jog and stuff.”\n\nI’m just interested in where it can be used and how the sound-replacement works, since it seems to change in different environments. It also doesn’t seem quite like a language game to me, but it’s the closest term I know that describes it, so if there’s something more apt, I’d love to know. \n\nThanks!",

It’s important to note, however, that I know next to nothing about computers. \n\nI plan on doing quantitative work in the future, so I’ll need something with more processing so it can run some of the funky stats programs. \n\nIf at all possible, I would like to stay with a MacBook, as I am an Apple person. I’m currently looking at a MacBook Pro with a 2.3GHz quad core processor and 256GB of storage.

The PIE root of this is *dʰeh₁-.\n\nHowever, apparently PIE dʱ became θ in Proto Italic, which then became /f/. This, however, is problematic since Venetic has the form vhagsto/hvagsto , with \"vh\" and \"hv\" apparently representing /xʷ/. This agrees with the Old Latin inscription as well (i.e. \"fh\" could also be transcribing xʷ, no?) except proto Italic xʷ is supposed to be coming from PIE gʷʰ. xʷ does supposedly eventually merge into /f/, but how on earth did we get it in the first place in multiple Italic languages if the PIE sound was dʱ, and if xʷ appears to have been preserved in both venetic and old Latin, then how can we be reconstructing fakiō for proto Italic?",

I know that kids are amazing at picking up on patterns, and I've even seen Latin books for adults that use the induction method. What I'm wondering is how it works going back and teaching grammar. For example, English not being a very highly inflected language makes it easy for a textbook to say \"Adding -ed makes the verb talk about something that happened in the past\". (Paraphrased from an actual 1st grade English book) Contrast with Spanish, where to teach the preterite, you'd need to mention -é, -aste, -ó, -amos, -asteis, and -aron, and even that's just for -ar verbs. \n\nSo what does it look like in a more highly inflected languages, when they go back to teach you grammar more formally in school?",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

Where did the ottoman spelling of words come from? (Ottoman Turkish has a weird quirk in that the spelling might not be phonetic, but it follows certain rules that makes spelling and pronunciation actually very oddly easy, these rules fall apart for any other Turkish language). My hypothesis is that Chagatai set the standard for writing Turkic languages in the Persian alphabet, but I'm not quite sure. Does anybody with knowledge of Ottoman Turkish spelling if it was the same spelling as other Turkic languages? Could a Turk and Uzbek read the same manuscript and understand everything? ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/8ytbmb/early_modern_swedish_pronunciation/",
        "text": "There seems to some resources about fairly recent historical pronunciations of some of the larger European languages available, such as English, German and Spanish. There have been much work put into how Shakespeare's poems were pronounced and rhymed when they were written. There aren't any sources in English concerning earlier Swedish for this so I thought I can contribute here.\n\nI will try to give an introduction to some features of Swedish as spoken around let's say 1700, there was no accepted standard pronunciation of Swedish \"Rikssvenska\" as today and the orthography was not yet settled, but I will give an overview for generic central Swedish. Many of these traits are today found in mostly western Swedish dialects and in Finland Swedish. \n\n- Many common words had not yet gotten a \"standard\" pronunciation, and differed between dialects. The pronouns *mig/dig/sig* were pronounced \"mäg,däg,säg\" in Svealand, but \"mej,dej,sej\" in Östergötland. The latter being ancestral to  the modern Swedish forms. The prepositions *vid* and *till* had /e:/ and were sometimes even written \"ve(d)\" and \"te\".\n\n- *kål* and *kol* were not merged, the latter being pronounced with a more open vowel often transcribed as /ɞ/, this also applied to the short vowel pairs *gått* and *gott*. This distinction is still mostly upheld in western Sweden dialects, hence the Göteborg pronunciation of *gott* as \"gött\"\n\n- Uvular r had not reached Sweden yet, it is never mentioned in any descriptions until the 1800s. And the assimilation of coda /r/ with following coronal consonant had just started and was nowhere near as widespread as today. In fact, assimilation of \"thick l\" and a coronal was probably older, as in *gult*, so when writers wanted to render /ʈ/ they wrote \"lt\", as in the word *ärter* that was written in as *alter* in a 18th century description of Östergötland dialect.\n\n- *hvar* and *var* were still distinct in the early 18th century, with *hv* being realized as /ʍ/. /w/ was still found in clusters like \"qvinna\" , \"svart\",  and \"tvätta\" that had /Cw/\n\n- The vast majority of Swedes would rhyme *gård* with *skål*. historical /rð/ and /l/ has completely merged into /ɽ/ pretty much everywhere but in Småland and parts of Finland. There are even spellings left in standard Swedish that reflect this merger, like *svål* and *vålnad*.\n\n- Short /e/ and /ɛ/ were clearly distinct for most speakers, with pairs like *sett* and *sätt*.  Lowering of front vowels \"ä\" and \"ö\" before /r/ was not widespread like today, they were pronounced much like western Swedish today.\n\n- /ʉ:/ was still a central vowel similar to English \"oo\" and not a compressed front vowel. This is still the case in Dalarna and Finland. The fact that it wasn't a front vowel also explains why it did not trigger palatalization.\n\n- Palatalization and assibilations before front vowels and /j/ was an still ongoing process and there were still some central dialects without it, (as recorded in Uppland in the 19th century). The developing sj-sound was not retracted yet and still similar to English \"sh\", as it still is in Norrland, Finland and Värmland. The cluster /stj/ did not merge with \"sj\" until around 1800. /k/ before front vowels became /t͡ʃ/ and merged with /tj/ during this period.\n\nSo in short, a Carolean from the great northern war would probably have sounded like a hard-to-place dialectal mix between Värmland and Finland Swedish dialect to a modern Swedish speaker. The Swedish poet *Georg Stiernhielm's* (1598 - 1672) last name would have been pronounced /stjɛ:rnjɛɽm/",

E.g. in the word Canada, the first syllable CAN is pronounced louder than the remaining two. \n\nHowever for intonation, all I've read is that it's the \"rise and fall of pitch\" but in my mind, isn't this exactly the same as stress? Because in the word Canada for example, I'm stressing the first syllable and saying it longer, and I'm also saying it louder, so wouldn't stressing automatically mean that you HAVE to say it louder? I can't imagine putting stress on a syllable without saying it at least slightly louder than another syllable. \n\nI don't understand how these two are different because they seem exactly the same to me.

We know that, as a rule of thumb, difficulty increases with the distance between L1 and L2 ([FSI scale](https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/sls/c78549.htm)). In terms of morphosyntax, some L1-L2 differences include (assuming English as the L1):\n\n* L2 features absent in L1 (e.g., subject markers in Japanese)\n* L1 features absent in L2 (no verb in stative sentences in Chinese - \"I good\")\n* word order differences (adjectives following nouns in Spanish)\n* multiple L1 features represented in a single L2 feature (a/an as a single indefinite article)\n* a single L1 feature represented in multiple L2 features (gendered articles)\n\nWhat I've found so far falls into one of two categories. Some research looks at aptitude-treatment interactions for structures like the past progressive (easy) versus the passive (difficult), with complexity defined by an observed order of acquisition (Yalçın &amp; Spada, 2016). Other research makes a more formal attempt at defining complexity, but the factors (\"perceptual salience, semantic complexity, morphophonological regularity, syntactic category, and frequency\") are mostly irrelevant in an experimental setting where the L2 is novel and the exposure minimal (Goldschneider &amp; DeKeyser, 2001).\n\nDo any of you know of any resources that formally characterize L2 syntactic complexity? Attention to the bullet points above would be really helpful. Thanks!\n\nEdit to add example: Which of the following would be most difficult / complex when learning L2 Chinese?\n\n那个人很孤独.\n&gt; that + classifier + person + very + lonely    \n(classifier absent in L1, \"to be\" from L1 absent in L2)\n\n在那边工作的人都是老师.\n&gt; at + there + work + relative clause marker + people + all + are + teacher    \n(L2 head final but L1 head initial, relative clause marker 的 is a single L2 feature that act as L1 relative *that* and possessive *'s*, L2 adverb *all* precedes verb)",
