Many males in my family grow well into their late teens and early twenties, so I was curious as to whether my caloric deficit of around 1,000 calories will stunt any further growth. If so, should I instead be at maintenance, or in a surplus, if I want to gain another inch or two in height? Thank you.",

Setting expectations - having an understanding of what to expect going into this journey\n3. Mindset - losing weight/being healthier is mostly mental, not physical\n4.

The problem is that I think my body is not recovering as fast as before after each training day, so I'm looking for some supplements that help me with that, I never used them before so I'm not sure the main difference between them and between brands. \n\nSome friend told me I should use creatine cuz it will help me with what I'm looking for and it won't increase my body volume but it will define muscle.",
