        "text": "Please note that I originally wrote this for the audience of a Facebook group which I feel may be a bit more casual than this subreddit, so I apologize if my word choice and tone are a bit... enthusiastic... \n\nspoiler alerts for: three billboards outside ebbing Missouri, peter rabbit, and call me by your name\n\nI come to my hill from the backlash surrounding this new Peter Rabbit movie: It is not the job of a filmmaker to deliver films featuring characters who are quite clearly and decidedly moral or immoral. I'm sick of people's shitty uneducated opinions about films stemming from believing otherwise. People seem to have forgotten that the job of the filmmaker is to tell stories in the motion picture medium, and not to deliver perfectly coherent messages regarding how we should behave. Here are three examples:\n\n1. Many have taken issue with a scene in \"Peter Rabbit\" in which the characters catapult a blackberry into the mouth of Mr. McGregor, whom they know has an allergy to the fruit. Firstly, Mr. McGregor has spent the film literally trying to kill these rabbits, the fucker deserves what's coming to, so I would honestly place this in the realm of reasonably moral. If someone tries to murder you, you are well within your right to fight back by sending them in anaphylactic shock.\n\n2. \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri\" has received backlash as a result of one of the characters, a police officer with a troubling history of racially motivated torture of a black suspect held in police custody is somewhat morally redeemed in the film's plot. On the surface level, that does seem somewhat problematic, but I'd argue this analysis lacks nuance in several ways. The first of those would be that the police officer is eventually fired by the new sheriff, a black man who, given his power granted to him by the story, is able to serve the police officer consequences for his history of morally reprehensible behavior. after this however, the police officer in question begins a shift towards doing good for others and attempting to find the murderer in a long-open murder case which is the central subject of the film. Though it is never said point blank (thus so many \"critics\" missing it) it is quite likely that given the series of events this police officer has come to understand that he has to be a better person, including be less of a racist ass.\n\nHowever, I'll even admit my argument for the morality of the character is shaky on this second one, but even then that doesn't change my hill. Whether or not he's still a racist asshole by the end of the film doesn't change the fact that this is a film about a bunch of angry people doing some fucked up shit to each other in the wake of some other fucked up shit. Literally the film is series of fucked up shit and it's damn entertaining and a good movie.\n\n3. Some people have a problem with \"Call Me by Your Name\" revolving around the relationship between a 17 year old and a 24 year old. This is one for which I have the hardest time arguing morality, and I may get some flack for even trying. Firstly, in Italy in the 80s, the age of consent was 14: whether or not you think this is right doesn't change the fact that the relationship is by all technical concerns legal given the setting and context of the film. Regarding morality, that gets a bit more shaky. While I do believe 18 is an appropriate age of consent, and that we should have a defined age of consent by law, I am rather annoyed by this idea that the second the clock strikes midnight on your 18th birthday your participation in sexual behavior with another adult becomes moral and that somehow your ability to make decisions regarding consent is suddenly perfectly nuanced and complete the moment you come of age.\n\nBut again, this is not an argument about whether or not these characters' behaviors are moral, this is an argument about why morality does not a good film make. \"Call Me by Your Name\" is an incredible film about a story which hits all too close to home for so many a young gay man. Hell, I wasn't even 17 before I was carrying on relationships with men far older than me. So many young gay men do it, in fact, resort to it, cause unlike young straight people, we often don't even know other gay people our age with whom we can have those early formative sexual experiences. And so even if Oliver is immoral in his relationship with Elio in the film, that doesn't change that the film is a representation of very true and real stories of young gay men, done incredibly well by a great cast and a crew.\n\ntl;dr: just cause the characters are shitty doesn't mean the movie is shitty. film characters don't need to be the epitome of moral behavior upon which we should model our own actions.\n\nI'd love to get others' thoughts on morality and how it impacts your opinion of a film. I feel as though my perspective is currently a bit limited to more contemporary, or in the case of this post, very recent films, but I believe there may be far more nuance to this question than what meets my eye. I also imagine we'll likely have different opinions regarding the purpose of cinema as well as moral responsibility of filmmakers and narratives.",

But the entire plot only works, at least when they first leave town, if it is believable that they love/care about one another. \n\nI was totally dumbfounded during the scene when Kit killed Holly's father. I mean, I know her father killed her dog, but the whole thing felt totally unreal. \n\nI don't know if it was more the acting, the directing, or what. But I felt that there was a whole nonchalance about the whole escapade. Again, I know that was part of the point of the movie, but to me the beginning suffered from a lack of realistic emotion.",

I see it's early period as some of the most interesting and beautiful cinema. Do you consider it innovative? Also is there any auteurs working today that you would suggest that convey a similar mood in their work? Goddard's early work specifically I consider to be a zenith of auteur theory. I see his films as being so personal. Do you agree that cinema today  generally doesn't reach this level of auteurship?\n\nThe reason I link the documentary is that it gives some interesting insights into Goddard's method of working- which contribute to the uniqueness of his style imo. Any contemporary examples of such unique techniques of working? \n\nApologies if this doesn't fit the subs criteria.",

        "text": "For a video version of my thoughts, see here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGOK3w4kWJ4&amp;t=49s\n\nYorgis Lanthimos’ dystopian comedy drama, in which single people are taken to a hotel where they must find a romantic partner in 45 days or face being turned into an animal, is a dark but side-splittingly hilarious satirical mirror into our society’s obsession in wedging into a specific and rigid set of rules, regardless of how preposterous they are. We can all agree that we do many things, even on a daily basis, that we don’t want to be doing and yet we still do it, because it is the social norm, it is the cultural pressures we are subjected to. The Lobster tackles one such area of our society - romantic relationships, how they play by the rules and how people behave in order to fit into the established order of things. It is a delightfully weird film, full of more and more absurdities as the film goes on, and as it does so it digs its claws in you and I found my really not wanting it to end – always the mark of a great film.\n\nOne of the first things you notice about The Lobster is the blunt, deadpan, almost cynical and nihilistic humour etched into almost every frame. Characters say the craziest things but deliver it in such a straight laced way, so as-a-matter-of-factly given conversation subjects we might see as taboo are the social norm in this society, and it had me laughing my arse off so many times. It’s by far the funniest film I’ve seen in the last year or two. All the actors are on point, everyone is in on the joke – Colin Farrell our protagonist is as good as he was in the outstanding In Bruges and delivers an awkward and offbeat performance as divorced Architect David, and playing off of him are the likes of Rachel Weisz, John C. Reily and Olivia Coleman. It’s like the film is taking the piss out of the characters, or at least, taking the piss out of us and the society we live in through the characters. I was getting some heavy Barry Lyndon vibes from the picture from its tone.\n\nFarrell’s time at the hotel is coming to an end, and in hastiness strategically decides to pair up with a creepy heartless woman who is said to be completely without feelings and comes across as a right sociopath. It’s a fine commentary on how often desperate people who are reeling after a break up or in fear of ending up alone convince themselves to settle for whomever for completely implausible reasons. The hotel has a set of crazy rules in place, rules that don’t seem so crazy when you link them to our world, like the fact that successful couples who are experiencing arguing and quarrelling in their relationships are assigned children to solve the problem, and how often have we seen cases in peoples’ lives, even our own, where the troubles of downward-spiralling couples are masked or ignored by them because they share children. At times the film comes off as an anti-advertisement for marriage and companionship.\n\nThe heartless woman is one of the most interesting characters in the film. She’s the hotel’s longest serving guest, being unable to find a mate and extending her stay by shooting down single people who are let loose into the woods, one of the hotel’s weird sporting activities. She is pretty scary, but perhaps in a weird way perhaps she is the only character at peace with herself. After all, she’s aloof all the time and makes no attempts at talking to people. Maybe she just isn’t interested in finding a mate? Maybe this limbo, along with its free drinks and hot tub, is all she needs? Or perhaps she’s been in the game for so long that she’s become numb to the whole thing? Who knows?\n\nAfter the film pokes fun at partnerships, which it treats as a commodity more than anything else, Farrell escapes and finds a rag tag group of fellow escapees in the woods, the leader of which invites him into their group. But the irony is that there’s so many rules, mainly centred on not being allowed to have a romantic partner, in this rebellion that Farrell is stuck yet again, and his position made even more complicated that he and Rachel Weisz’s character form an interest with each other. It’s a pessimistic loop, a cynical paradox of conformity. Farrell rebelled, and he ended up in a rebellious group, but the rebellious group, the counterculture, has so many rules that limit him he ended up being just as much of a prisoner as he was in the hotel, the mainstream culture.. It reminds me of a movie idea I had in my head in the shower or the toilet or whatever, where a freedom-loving rebellion overthrows an evil bureaucratic government and after doing so they put rules into place to form structure and order, but ironically in order to enforce the order they end up eventually just like the original evil government. Had the woods folk took over the hotel, I can see this exact scenario playing out. The film does indeed has something to say the sheep or herd mentality. I mean, has anyone in the film’s universe even questioned whether they actually do turn you into an animal after 45 days, and don’t just outright kill you?\n\nIn the second half of the film Farrell spends more time with the rebels, and it’s here where the anti-partnership…’propaganda’, shall we call it, flips and through the handicapping of a character and another’s defiance in taking care of said character, it’s almost like the film is saying “hey, maybe being alone isn’t the answer. Maybe if it’s organic and real, not forced, partnership can be a beautiful thing.” Where before it mocked people’s need to be together, in the second half it was now mocking those who feel the need to be independent just as mercilessly.\n\nI really want to talk about the fantastic ambiguous ending but seeing as though that would delve into spoiler territory I think I’ll leave it there for now. I am really glad I saw The Lobster. It was an absolute laugh out loud riot, a bizarre and insane screwball comedy but rich, intelligent and it does leaves you thinking. I give it an 8/10.",

I'm collecting movie shots and scenes where a pianist is sitting at her or his piano, but is not (yet) playing. Staring at the keys, wondering what to do, getting ready for a performance, mimicking playing without touching the keys... Anything like that. The character can be a concert pianist or not. There can be an audience watching or not.\n\nThere are the obvious movies that will yield such footage. Polanski's \"The Pianist\" and Haneke's \"The Piano Teacher\". \"The Legend of 1900\" or \"Shine\". But I'm hoping to find similar scenes in movies that aren't necessarily about a pianist. There's a nice scene in \"45 Years\" that has Charlotte Rampling (not) playing, and there are useful scenes in movies such as \"The Notebook\" or the (piano and violin) scene in Chaplin's \"Limelight\", to name just a few I've already thought of, and to give an idea of what I was hoping to find.\n\nDo you film lovers have scenes that come to mind? Anything goes: I'm hoping for pointers to older and lesser known movies as well. Any help is greatly appreciated! \n\nThanks!\n\nDavid",

        "text": "This is a movie I watch about every year or so, and I never really thought much about why it clicks with me.  It's one of those movies where the meaning changes as I get older.\n\nWhy do I like this movie so much?  Well first off the filming is great.  David Fincher is awesome but I think their are a lot of great movies that are on par with this.  Acting gets a check mark for me too but again a lot of movies have a good cast.  \n\nI think the reason this movie stands out for me is that the narrator's plight feels so real and human, unlike some movies.  I'm not saying that this movie is realistic.  It's extremely contrived and is very unrealistic.  But I just can't help find the narrator's plight so relatable.  \n\nThe way I interpret is this, which may differ from how other people interpret it.  \n\nI think the story is about the narrator's struggle to find any sense of self.  It's evident at the beginning that he doesn't have any.  He goes to a job because that's what he thinks he Should do.  He identifies as a consumer, binges television, and has no intimate relationships.  We learn through tidbits of information that he had a rather unsupportive childhood that he's resentful of. He's going through the motions.   \n\nHis failure to maintain this empty lifestyle devolves into anger, self-hatred, mental illness, and a need to rebel against a society that he perceives is composed of those who dominate and those who are submitted.  \n\nTyler Durdan is an immature caricature of what he wants or feels he should be.  He willfully becomes this to the point of committing atrocious acts.  I think the ending scene with Tyler is quite good.  I don't think I understood it the first few times I watched it, but I interpret it as this.  The reason Tyler disappeared at the end is because the narrator no longer needs him.  He's metaphorically killing that part of himself and I think in its place fills it with a sense of his own identity.  \n\nI wish there was more of a denouement, as the movie kind of just feels like it ends suddenly.  But that's probably because it was a very long movie. \n\nAnyway, I really like this theme and the struggle that the narrator goes through in the film.  And I think Fincher's direction really complimented the insanity of it quite well.  \n\nWhat do other people think of this film?  I know its probably one of those movies thats open to a lot of interpretation.  ",

I personally find it difficult to feel a lot of warmth/affection without sadness or excitement, so it's been kind of hard for me to find clips. But I'm interested to see what you guys think of!\n\nA couple of other notes:\n*We are trying to see how individual differences in Agreeableness and Extraversion influence the way people react to the clips. I'm not under any illusion that responses will be universal, the differences are a large part of the research question.\n*We are trying to avoid animated, \"hard\" sci-fi, or fantasy clips, as these will likely tap into other personality constructs we aren't directly interested in, in this study, such as openness.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts on video clips that make you feel \"warm and affectionate,\" I'd really appreciate the feedback!",

        "text": "15:17 to Paris is a very odd film. I haven't seen a whole lot of Clint Eastwood's filmography, but I do know this film is one-of-a-kind.\n\nDespite being marketed as a thriller, the film only contains around ten to fifteen minutes of genuinely suspenseful footage. The bulk of the film is a sequence of chronologically sorted vignettes focusing on the life of the main heroes, primarily zeroing in on Spencer Stone. This sounds mundane, and for the most part it is, but in a strangely compelling manner.\n\nThe film doesn't propel itself with tight scripted plotting, fast-paced dialogue, flashy visuals or any of those things, it does it by progressively showing the spectator mundane parts of Spencer Stone's life. And it works. The expository scenes are interesting because they're so uninteresting. The acting, like that of the unprofessionals of Italian neorealism, is pitch-perfect and gives the film a surreal tone. The cumulative effect of this style of filmmaking is that heroism itself becomes something mundane, something completely normal. And it's only from that basic point that the full moral gravity of what those men did can be understood. The film demolishes the idea of heroes being demigods and rebuilds it as something invoking responsibility and chance in equal measure. In short, heroism goes from being cinematically remarkable and unrealistic in real life, to being cinematically mundane and realistic in real life.\n\nThe film has drawbacks. Eastwood's politics appear subtly but they're as strange in this film as they are in real life. The direct political content is quite restrained though and only really pops up occasionally, such as when a German tour guide scolds the heroes in an unrealistic, over the top manner over them not knowing where Hitler died, or when an alt-looking coworker scoffs at Spencer for giving an army recruiter a free juice. I know these things don't sound political, but they add up and conveniently tie into the military-worshipping, arrogant right wing identity politics that seem very popular in the US today.\n\nThe exposition of the villain is also disappointing; I wish it was done the same way it was done with the heroes.\n\nI guess the million dollar question for me is exactly what kind of relationship Eastwood has with his characters: is he lionising them? Pitying them? Sympathising with them? Supporting them? It's not exactly clear to me as he seems to do all of these things in a very subtle manner. \n\nI am interested in hearing other people's thoughts on this film as most of the discussion I can find on subs like /r/movies is overly dismissive.",

        "text": "I've been meaning to see it for a while and finally had the chance to. I'll start by saying I've been more into absurdist sort of films as of late, but this has to be the most absurd I've seen so far. I liken it to a mix between a Jodorowsky film, Monty Python's Holy Grail, A Field in England, and a Russian Ark; in that we are taken on a tour of sorts through this grotesque, macabre medieval setting where absurdity reigns supreme and violence and degradation are around every corner. \n\nI can't say I fully understood the film, or even much of it. It was a great experience though. I really enjoy the 'slice of life/ day in the life' aspect of it, where we are almost treated as an honored guest, being led through the disgusting environment that Don Rumata inhabits, while the peasants and slaves taunt us or attempt to show us things as they happen. The fourth wall breaks are interesting, and I feel as though the camera is meant to be a half sort of character, wandering along and observing as events unfold. \n\nAnother interesting aspect is that there seems to be a very very minimal story, and most characters lack any motivation or context other than what is happening in the immediate moment. It makes it feel real and natural watching them react to things that happen or go about their neurosis and tics while being pushed out of the way or having sludge smeared on their faces. \n\nI was confused about the overarching plot; the movie explains that scientists found this planet like ours, but stuck in Medieval times and I'm assuming Don Rumata was one of those explorers at one point. Though he became consumed by his Demi-God noteriety and his lavish living high above the peasants of the village, and sort of grew accustomed to living on this world. \n\nAt the end he talks with Paschka and tells him to leave back to earth and that he will stay there, instead shaving his head and, I'm assuming, moving on to a new village with his things and his slaves in tow. Am I correct about that? It was hard to discern exactly what was going on at any moment, but nonetheless I enjoyed the experience and the atmosphere. It's a long, arduous movie to get through and I'm not sure I could watch it again anytime soon, but very much enjoyed it. \n\nAny thoughts or analyses on the film? ",

        "text": "Hello r/TrueFilm, welcome to the unofficial discussion of r/TrueFilm's favourite films of 2017\n\n**WHY IS THIS HERE?**\n\nSince I haven't gotten any response from the mods regarding the annual year-in-review thread, and the new year is already unfolding, I decided to make my own thread. \n\nBecause of its accessibility, I see this thread as a chance for people who aren't quite as well-versed in discussing film to participate in a discussion here. On top of that, it serves as an aggregate of what people found special last year.\n\n^(I don't mind this thread being removed if there is some secret mod discussion that I don't know about.) \n\nAnyway, here's how the poll works:\n\n* Choose **five** films from 2017. The only criteria is that they can be found on Letterboxd, so you may include both short and feature films. \n\n* Choose **one** of those films to receive **two points**. It can be your favourite or one you feel went overlooked, it's up to you. The rest of your selections will get **one point**. (If you don’t specify, I’ll assume your first pick is your two point pick)\n\n* In order for your entry to count, please write about one of your films. Remember to write over 180 characters. I do recommend you write something about all of your picks, especially ones that are controversial or ones that you just feel strongly about. Anything that generates discussion is good!\n\nYou are also welcome to include any other extra thoughts or awards you'd like to give.\n\nIn the end, your submission should look something like this:\n&gt;***Emoji Movie* (dir. Tony Leondis)** (two points)\n\n&gt;Made me wonder if I was destroying an entire economy by only using the eggplant emoji\n\n&gt;***Fifty Shades Darker* (dir. James Foley)** (one point)\n\n&gt;I didn't know they made this until I saw a poster for the third one\n\n&gt;**Honorable Mentions:** Boss Baby, Ferdinand, Phantom Thread\n\n&gt;**Boring Sequels:** Blade Runner 2049\n\n&gt;**Great Sequels:** Pitch Perfect 3^(The pitches are back baby!)\n\n**WHAT COUNTS AS 2017?**\n\nUltimately it's up to you. I like going by whatever Letterboxd says the release year is, but if a movie only came out this year in your country, you're welcome to show it some love. \n\n**WHEN DOES THE VOTING PERIOD END?**\n\nSince there was no announcement, I'll end the voting period on **MARCH 1ST**. Anything afterwards will not be counted. Also, ***The Shape of Water*** and ***Call Me by Your Name*** will be available for rent via ITunes on the 27th of February, so you can quickly slip those in before the voting period ends if you haven't seen them. \n\nI'll try to get the results up before the Oscars ceremony.\n\nThat's all - vote away! \n\nEdit: Thank you for all your submissions! The poll has finished and everything has been counted; you can find the results thread [here](http://reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/81djoo/results_rtruefilms_favorite_films_of_2017/).\n",

        "text": "I'm going to try to redeem myself for that TLJ mishap so here it goes...\n\nI had no real motive to see the movie. I had a moviepass subscription and wanted to see something so I chose that film and man did I love it. A couple of months after the fact and it seems like nobody really cared for this film; I'll say it, it's underrated.\n\nThe film gets the feel of Los Angeles through tons of wide shots and close-ups of various elements such as the monuments and landscapes that make LA. While it may seem like it's following the recent LA bandwagon, it does everything it can to make you feel like this is really LA. Like Roman J. Israel is an actual person.\n\nAdding to that, a lot of the cinematography work is above par for the course, we get a lot of close ups involving Denzel Washington who expresses like there's no tomorrow. Though there's a lack of frenetic shots; the calm, smooth shots showcase Roman's highs and lows as he goes through a journey of selling his soul to the devil in exchange for a small bit of happiness. It gives off a calm before the storm feeling that makes us feel loss and sadness for the only lawyer who was for the underdog.\n\nDenzel Washington plays the role much like an outsider, who knows what he's doing but ultimately can't convey what he wants. His weirdness in the initial moments sets up the meat of the film which is his world contrasted with reality. The film is essentially a progressive role reversal where his ultimate goals are achieved long after he lost all of his ideals. The people he thought who were the devils were really the good guys and due to that, we feel more loss for his character than ever before.\n\nIt's plot may seem simplistic but it's a good basis for Roman J. Israel. It showcases desperation, despair and distortion all in one. It's sociopathic but human at the same time which is a lot considering that very few films are able to say what they want to say; you really feel the danger and the existential crisis for Roman because of the structure and the progression.\n\nDan Gilroy does a good job of putting this film together, I really loved this film and I'm saddened that not many people liked it because once Star Wars came out for the 8th time, people just forgot about this film. I wanted to see it a 2nd and maybe a 3rd time in theaters but eh, maybe I'll just wait for Netflix or Redbox to put this up.\n\nIf you have a chance, see this film. Don't believe what the critics say.",

Basically every MCU movie that comes out gets the same critical reception. \n\nI’m convinced that the people who chose now to join the “MCU movies are bad” bandwagon are more upset by the black-positive message of the movie. They may try and tell you they just don’t want politics in their superhero movies, but that doesn’t hold water, seeing as _Captain America_ has been a tentpole of this franchise for almost 10 years!\n\nDon’t get me wrong; I’m will probably dislike _Black Panther_ for the same reasons I dislike most Marvel movies, but I definitely don’t appreciate all of the company this time around...

        "text": "First of all, I should say that The Revenant and Gravity are two of my favorite films of the decade so far. They both received great reviews and average people I talk to loved them. However, on the internet I've seen tons of criticism towards these two films from film fans and experts and it's hard to understand why. \n\nIt seems that the biggest argument is that these movies are very surface level with simple stories and characters, and not much complexity or deeper meaning. My point here is why should that be a negative? Yes they are both very simple survival stories. I think the main theme of both movies is: what keeps people going after they lose everything. I think Roger Ebert once said what's important isn't what a movie is about but how it's about it (forgive me for getting the quote wrong, just how I remember it). Maybe certain film fans are very analytical and don't appreciate these kinds of movies as much as the average person. But these movies are clearly not meant to be complex character studies and should't be judged as such. \n\nSo I think what makes these two movies so good is that they are true \"experiences\". They are extremely immersive and we really feel like we are lost in the wilderness or in space with the characters. There aren't many films that can give you this kind of experience these days so I really appreciated it. Even watching at home I felt this way. They are intense, suspenseful and of course both visually incredible. Not only that but I found myself truly caring for the characters and feeling emotion despite how uncomplicated they were or the blandness of their dialogue. The performances in these films are also excellent. Leo Decaprio, Tom Hardy, Sandra Bullock, and George Clooney deliver powerful and very difficult performance which should be considered some of the best of the decade. Finally I felt that both films carried home the themes of life, death, and the human spirit in a very powerful and meaningful way despite their simplicity. Anyway what are you thoughts on these films and the reactions to them?",

The characters are layered and everything is a lot more than it seems at a first glance. Less is more, would be a fitting saying for such movies.

Sometimes its kinda hard to explain why you love such works. Its just resonates with you somewhere inside you.

I thought it was incredibly pretentious, SO boring and slow, I felt like I didn't understand what was going on half the time, I didn't care about a single character, women were used as props and discarded, and the love story was just there all of a sudden (what made them fall in love with each other? I literally didn't care about their relationship even a little bit). The actual \"call me by your name\" scene felt forced in to give the movie a reason for its title and I had to go home and google \"why does Oliver ask Elio to call him by his name\" because it didn't make any sense to me. The peach scene came off as a pointless gross-out scene for shock value and to give the movie something, ANYTHING memorable. The big conflict was that they broke up? Okay? My first love would have made a much better book/movie lol. I'm a very emotional person, and I cry at almost every movie I watch, even comedies. I didn't come close to shedding a tear at this one, and I feel like I should have. I felt no emotional attachment to anyone or anything, just entirely disconnected. The dad's speech at the end felt rambling, aimless, Oscar bait-y, a jumbled mess of random thoughts that felt like the writer was throwing a bunch of quotes at a wall and hoping at least one of them would become memorable (although that may be a fault of the book; I haven't read it). And you know what? Yes, I found the age gap creepy. There. I said it. \n\nI'll say this - the cinematography was beautiful and Timothée is a brilliant actor. That's it. That's all I've got.\n\nI'm so baffled by the overwhelming positive reviews for this one, and despite searching all over the internet I have yet to find someone who actually explains what was so good about this movie.

Luke's character arc affected me deeply as someone who has suffered shame and depression, and it played to way more interesting and realistic themes than if he had just kicked ass throughout the movie.\n\nEntitled super-fans even write about being “betrayed” by certain aspects of the plot.\n\nThese people miss the point entirely. An interesting relatable story will last longer in our hearts than pandering nods to past movies. Didn’t they learn that from the prequels?\n\nIt draws parallels with *Empire* as a story based on simple real moments with key underlying lessons and messages.\n\nYes it's far from perfect, I'd have gotten rid of parts of this movie (I don't want to spoil anything but I've put them in the article above) but I don't think they make this a bad movie like some have said.\n\nWould be interested to hear your thoughts on this.

I only began watching the first part after hearing about it being one of the greatest movies of all time so often.\n\nI agree that the third installment isn't the best of the 3, but I don't get why it receives so much hate. People often mention Vincent and Mary's 'incest' and that it was weird. Well, maybe it was weird, but love, and even marriage among cousins is not so uncommon even in today's world. From an American point of view, it may seem outlandish. But according to [this](http://i.imgur.com/iwhzPq2.png)\n study, inbreeding was common in Sicily, and did occur in Italy. Although the data is only until 1964, I doubt the trend took a steep turn in the span of 20 odd years.\n(Please don't turn this into a \"So you support incest?\" argument. I do not.)\n\nI saw the initial flirtation scenes between Mary and Vincent, as they talked about their past, as a nod to the shift in time from the first movie. \n\nThe only thing that struck me as a little odd was Michael's demeanor towards Kay when he surprises her by filling in for her driver. It was a little over the top - brash and loud, and very unlike Michael who never put his emotions on display so openly even when he was in love with Kay as a young man.\n\nApart from that, the scenes where even Connie is shown to be a Corleone when she murders the older Don using a poisoned Cannoli, where Joey Zasa insults Vincent's parentage, Don Altobello's betrayal, the nod to Michael's past and the entire movie overall was not a particularly bad ending, especially to the tragedy that was Michael Corleone.",

        "text": "Firstly wow, wow, wow! I absolutley loved this movie from start to finish. However, the ending left me kinda baffled as to what the actual meaning was so I would like to give my own thoughts and see what you guys think.\n\n\nOnce again **SPOILER** warning so please don't let me ruin this great film for you and turn back now if you haven't seen it!\n\nOkay so the film goes as follows:\n\n- Starts off at a sailing expo and Sir Francis Chichester announces there will be a race around the world (except this time with no stops unlike the one he won). \n\n- Colin Firth is inspired by both his great feat and how his business is struggling to do well\n\n- He has the idea of doing the race in order to promote his company by saying that if an ordinary man can do it their technology must be great\n\n- Colin then gets a pushy press agent who begins selling the story hard and makes Colin uncomfortable, signs of this are the delays in getting the ship ready in time and Colin attempting to rush the preperations by getting more funding from his sponsor to the extent that he 'bets' his house deeds and business.\n\n- In the background of all of this Colin has a lovely family who are very loving eachother and whilst his kids are amazed and his wife is supportive she doesn't really want him to go\n\n- Colin sets sail and is very nervous/scared\n\n- Almost immediatley he runs into problems from having rushed preparations\n\n- After struggling to make good progress, Colin thinks he can lie about his position\n\n- He messages home and everyone is amazed and the press makes him a national hero\n\n- Morale improves and he begins to make progress\n\n- Press agent lies about his lie putting him even further ahead of the other racers (who started later than him and Colin is racing to win the cash prize)\n\n- Colin decides to cut off his radio to avoid being caught out\n\n- Other racers begin to drop out\n\n- Morale begins to drop and his ship becomes damaged beyond repair at sea so he is forced to stop at Argentina (going against the rules)\n\n- He proceeds with his trip but does not wish to win because of his lie\n\n- The last remaining racer other than Colin drops out meaning Colin will win\n\n- Colin kills himself by drowning but leaves the logbooks behind proving that he was nowhere near completing the journey\n\n\nMy thoughts are that Colin is caught in a vicious cycle with the media. Yes, he has an interest in sailing but we are told at the beginning that he has very little sailing experience. Therefore, he is intially brought into this cycle by Sir Francis Chichester glamorising the race and the media glamorising the wealthy lifestyle that he lives. Whilst Colin has no reason to enter the race. He has a loving, supporting family who lives comfortably. Yet a combination of his interest for maritine engineering and the media's portrayal of glamour has attracted him.\n\n\nThere are already two sides to this: \n\n1. Colin is a very driven person (he begins talking of 'Men don't search to be extraordinary, men search to do extraordinary things' and 'to do something that's been done by another, is to live in another's shaddow') \n\n2. Colin is sucked into a dream that is overwhelming.\n\n\nI believe that Colin would have been able to complete the trip had it not been for the media pushing him so hard. Had there been enough time to prepare the boat, he would have had fewer problems. (This is shown by his attention to detail and perfectionist nature when talking about his product at the beginner, discussions with the boat builder and inspection prior to the start). I also believe this is shown by the way in which Colin's morale is boosted and begins to make good progress once he is able to not feel the pressure after lying about his position. Furthermore, once he lies it his not intention to win. However, his lies and the media's coverage leads to other racers quitting. (There is also the indication that other racers have lied about their positions as they turn off their radios under similar circumstances and thus are also contributing to the bigger problem - discussed later).\n\n\nI think the reason Colin does not want to win at this stage is because of the connection with his wife and kids who are seen as very pure. However, he cannot quit as that would mean the loss of his house and business.\n\n\nBut this brings into question his original motives for doing the race. He wanted to DO something extraordinary, not BE extraordinary so what is the point in doing this lie? So eventually this thought catches up with him as the other remaining racer quits and he will be the winner. All he has to do is return, it is no longer a race. And as opposed to doing so, he decides to kill himself and leave his logbooks behind to expose the truth that he could not live with. \n\n\nWhereas, had Colin realised that he was being sucked into this 'overwhelming dream' and been appreciative of what he actually he has in front of him he would've realised that other than improving his business he was only satisfying his ego and I think this is the main message of the film delivered by the portrayal of the heartless and greedy media. Yet he is partly to blame by not questioning his motives, being appreciative of his surrounding and pursuing this glorified dream. I think this is best shown by the scene where he is lying in bed with his wife and (apologies as I cannot remember the exact words) but something to the effect of I don't want you to go but I can't let you not go, not because I won't be able to live with you or the kids won't be able to live with you but because you won't be able to live with yourself.\n\n\nI think there is something very black mirror-esque about the film in the way that people are driven by ideas portrayed in the media as good ones when they don't see the full picture and don't question their motives more and secondly, how we are a greedy species. Yes, that is how we grow by wanting the next best thing but how many times do we ever stop and actually appreciate what we have?\n\n\nLoved that film, apologies if you don't approve of my thoughts and/or writing but I hope you can appreciate this is the first ever 'essay' I have wrote about a film (I literally just came out of the cinema 30ish minutes ago! - Yes, that good haha). Also, apologies for any misquotes and inaccuracies.\n\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts.",

        "text": "Video Form: https://youtu.be/QLkxJ-2fjCU\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes: How Andy Serkis Evokes Emotion\n\nWhat is it exactly that distinguishes a good actor from a great one? First of all, an actor is good if he can make us believe he’s actually going through whatever his character is going through, especially the psychological aspect of human behavior. Humphrey Bogart is the embodiment of a cynic, broken man in Casablanca and De Niro truly captures human loneliness in Taxi Driver. There’s something about these performances that goes beyond good and transcends into the realm of legendary status. What is it then? The ability to let go, to share something that most people keep within themselves is incredibly effective in evoking emotion. Great actors are completely exposed, vulnerable and share parts of themselves that aren't necessarily pretty. This can make a performance truly unpredictable. This is Heath Ledger as the Joker and James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano. But for us, the first actor that actually comes to mind when thinking about performances that forever changed the game is Andy Serkis.\n\nThe development of more realistic CGI, has allowed Motion Capture to become a reliable tool in film. The technology allows motion capture actors to become more expressive each year. Andy Serkis, the “King of Motion Capture Acting”, has portrayed characters that break the boundaries of what was once thought possible in movies. Retarded cartoon rabbits aside, Gollum was the first digital character to feel alive on screen. Besides the realism and technical detail of the creature, Serkis made Gollum’s internal struggles seem very real, to the point of striking compassion for a fully digital character, something that was unheard of at the time.  But it’s his performance in the Planet of the Apes trilogy, particularly in the latest entry in the franchise that is truly extraordinary.\n\nTo make a movie like this work, where the protagonist is a mostly mute digital ape, it takes a lot more than conventional acting techniques. “So many people think studying the role for Caesar, for instance, is purely about copying ape movements and to put everybody straight on that, that is really sort of Room 101. That’s where you begin. After that, you realize that it’s not just about mimicking behavior, it’s about creating a character. So there are all these psychological and emotional journeys that one has to import into the character, so it’s not just about the physical build of the character, but the whole internalization. And that’s why the misconception that performance capture acting is sort of a genre or type of acting is completely wrong. It’s no different to any process you go through to create a role, whether you’re on stage, in front of a screen in a more conventional sense. The actor’s performance is the actor’s performance.” Serkis brings a physicality and raw emotion to set that is rarely seen. In War for the Planet of the Apes, we see a man who is completely in command of his behavior as Caesar, the chimpanzee. From learning the proper body language of these animals to creating the personality of the main character of a feature film, Serkis delivers one of his best performances to date.\n\nThe remarkable thing about War for the Planet of the Apes is the characters. It’s extremely rare for a film, especially for a war movie, to have the characters on both sides be equally interesting. The colonel, played by Woody Harrelson is a perfect Yin to Caesar’s Yang and both have understandable motivations of their own. The colonel is fighting his own “holy war” for humanity’s survival and Caesar is on a path of revenge. The interesting part is that we’re actually on the side of the apes, here. How was that achieved?\n\nCaesar is a leader and only wants the best for his people, or in this case his apes. His path of vengeance isn’t exactly what he’s all about, but that’s what makes him an interesting and even relatable character. Through Serkis’ performance, we are shown the dark side of Caesar, what psychiatrist Carl Jung called “The Shadow”. Jung wrote: “Everyone carries a shadow, and the less embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.” It’s the dark side of our personality because it consists of primitive emotions and impulses like anger or rage and completely overshadows an enlightened consciousness. Throughout the Apes Trilogy, we witness the evolution of Caesar from a baby ape into a hardened leader. The evolution from pure animal instinct to quasi-human consciousness. War, however, always makes affairs return to the primitive.\n\nInterestingly, what makes Caesar a relatable character is the same thing that makes Andy Serkis’ performances so good. In the beginning of this essay, it was mentioned that what makes a performance transcend is the ability to let go, to show the audience a side of yourself that is hidden, something that we feel we shouldn’t be seeing. Great actors are completely exposed, vulnerable and share parts of themselves that aren't necessarily pretty. This is what separates a good performance from a great one. Great actors, give us a glimpse of the dark side of human nature. They give us a glimpse of the shadow that we all carry. \n",

        "text": "With the exception of *Lost in Translation* and maybe *The Virgin Suicides*, her films have generally gotten 'so-so' to downright terrible reviews. On Letterboxd and Criticker, I constantly see her films getting low rankings/stars and a steady flow of hate. I wanted to address some of the most common critiques I see and my own personal take on them.\n\n1. **Uninteresting**. I constantly see comments that her films are straight up boring and lacking in any sort of depth. While this is subjective, I don't agree. For example, *Marie Antoinette* gets this label frequently and I think it's because this film, along with many others of hers, are very much 'show-not-tell' films. *Marie Antoinette* is a modern take on a historical drama (something I perceived to be refreshingly unconventional) about an incredibly complex character and situation. Can you imagine being 14 years old, shipped away from everyone you know to a foreign country to marry a man you've never met, and then be pressured by your entire family and an entire COUNTRY to have a child with this stranger you married who has no interest in having sex with you? I don't know, I thought everything about the plot was fascinating as a viewer.\n\nSofia used *Marie Antoinette* to explore isolation (another common theme in her films) and I think she captured the feeling well. It was meant to make you feel as detached as the main character was in that time of her life.  Maybe people just aren't interested in that type of film, I'm not sure.  \n\n2. **Vapid**. I guess this goes along with 'uninteresting', but it's still its own entity. I think this aspect of her films goes over a lot of viewers heads. They are vapid because they are SUPPOSED to be vapid. It's her critique on modern culture. *The Bling Ring* is the most obvious example; the film is meant to be a commentary on the shallow materialism of the real-life privileged LA teenagers the film was based upon. *Somewhere* showcased the vapidness of Hollywood life, in which the protagonist connecting with his daughter put real substance back into his life. Even if you look at her earlier works, such as her first short *Lick the Star*, she really enjoys subtly mocking and exploring vapidness in the modern age. It's a holding a mirror to her audience, especially those in the LA/Hollywood scene. Maybe this makes people uncomfortable. Her films aren't actually shallow, they are just very self-aware.\n\n3. **Feminine**. I understand I'm veering into controversial territory with this, but I can't help to think it plays a factor in an industry unquestionably dominated by testosterone. To be quite frank, heavily feminine modern films (especially those by female directors) just don't do well. They don't get nominated, they don't do great with critics. *The Love Witch*, a recent film by Anna Biller, is a great example. She's even mentioned in interviews that her mostly male crew tried to sabotage her during filming because they just hated what they were shooting. While Susan Seidelman is considered an accomplished director, her female-focused films don't get great reviews either. I think it's a shame because Sofia and the other directors I've mentioned put immense detail into costume and set design and all-consuming aesthetic qualities that largely go unappreciated. Sofia's dreamy aesthetic is so recognizable that it's easy to view a film and immediately know if it was directed by her. I think that's a sign of talent.\n\n---------\n\nPersonally, I think she's a great director but maybe a bit misunderstood. This is just the surface of the argument but I would love to hear what you all think as well.",

He eventually finds her and, after they stare at each other for a while, he grabs her and runs off with her...\n\nWhat do you think the significance of this is? Part of me wonders if he didn't take her over to the main floor and dance with her. But in the following scene, Reynolds is very distraught and frustrated with Alma. So maybe a lot of time passed between the two scenes? Or maybe he really just couldn't stand that she'd turned away from him, so he dragged her back home. If that's the case, the preceding build up with JG's beautiful music and the balloons falling etc. seems like it kind of went to waste, no?\n\nOr maybe it holds significance in that it depicts Reynolds at his worst: like a child. It sort of reminds me of when I was little and my Mom would leave me in a room to play alone. I, like I imagine many children would, would go find her because I wanted her attention. Is that what Reynolds was doing?\n\nWhat do y'all think? :)",

        "text": "This film is exceptionally dark and goes to a place I did not expect. It really was something. I did a review of it here if you're interested:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AnC2bQuEd8\n\nIf you prefer to read, I wrote it up also below.\n\nWord of warning though - I felt it was best to go into the film blind, and it's difficult to talk about the film having to gloss over the entire 'thing' the film is about, so I will mention it below. This will probably be regarded as a spoiler by most although I'm not exactly sure (it's character driven and isn't full of twists and turns). Read at your own risk anyway.\n\nSidley Lumet was of my favourite directors. He was a specialist in cop thrillers and courtroom dramas, movies that felt real, gritty, and dirty. Some of his hits include Serpico, The Verdict, Prince of the City, 12 Angry Men and my personal favourite, Dog Day Afternoon. One of the more praiseworthy aspects of his films were the performances his actors would deliver – you’ll often find that a famous actor might be more known for a different film, but the movie in which he would push himself to his limits, give a performance that towers over his other films, would belong to Lumet. Like Vin Diesel in Find Me Guilty. Often this would be because Lumet, who directed 17 different actors in Oscar nominated roles, loved to hold private rehearsals with the cast, giving them time and opportunity to experiment and get a real feel of their characters. He was a favourite among actors, encouraging them forward their own creative ideas for their characters.\n\nThe problem with Lumet’s filmography is that the man loved to constantly work, regardless of the quality of the picture. Apparently when he was without a project he would literally pull out a script from his bedside drawer and film it, so it’s no wonder that there’s a few stinkers on his CV to counter his classics. It’s for this reason that I wasn’t too sure how to set my expectations going into the comparatively obscure The Offence, his British police flick in which a police officer snaps whilst interrogating a suspected child molester and proceeds to physically assault him.\n\nIn one of his 5 pairings with Lumet, Sean Connery plays the burnt out Detective Sergeant Johnson who is part of a team trying to track down a child molester who already has a handful of victims to his name, and stop him before he strikes again. He slips through the cracks, however, and assaults a school girl who is later found by Johnson in the woods, horrified and half naked. The police bring in a suspect, Kenneth Baxter, who was staggering drunk around the town. A short unsuccessful interrogation follows, after which Sergeant Johnson, who is clearly a larger than life character and adept at scaring his interviewees, has a go. From outside the interrogation room the police staff hear scuffles and screams, and burst through the room to find Baxter lying unconscious on the floor, covered in blood, and Johnson standing over him looking like the grim reaper himself. Baxter is taken to hospital and it is Johnson’s turn to be interviewed, all whilst there is a real possibility that the battered suspect could die in prison.\n\nThe Offence goes to a very dark and unsettling place. It was definitely not the cop film I was expecting. In fact, whether Baxter committed the crimes or not have very little to do with what the film is about. What the film is instead concerned with is Johnson’s inner demons that are eating away at him, the disturbing chasm that has grown and grown over the years, covering more and more ground in Johnson’s mind until he cannot ignore it anymore, he cannot retract it into the back of his mind. It seems that in his role as an officer, what with all the horrible things he’s seen and his burden in getting into the minds of his suspects, it’s all suddenly taken its toll and he has begun to have taboo and dirty thoughts of his own. He has starred so long and hard into the abyss, that it has opened its eyes, starred back, and reached out a twisted hand. Johnson’s inability in killing the sick thoughts he has found himself having about the girl he found naturally alarm him, and though we do not see until the very end of the film what caused Johnson to go berserk and launch himself at Baxter, midway through the film he’s home after the interrogation. The reason I bring this up is because it’s one of the many examples of the terrific directorial work from Lumet. On his way out of the parking lot, Johnson briefly hits his car on the curb on the way out. He must have driven out of that lot hundreds of times and yet tonight he’s hit the curb on the way out. That, and along with him trying to open the wrong apartment door when he gets home, are subtle hints that his mind is elsewhere, that today something is not right. He must’ve have beaten up a few suspects in his time, after all it was 1970’s Britain, but today something is different. Something happened at that interrogation.\n\nAnother piece of nuanced brilliance from Lumet is that the way in which he films the scenes at Johnson’s apartment make the man look even bigger than he usually looks. All of a sudden the walls look closer, the corridors tighter. Johnson’s world is becoming more and more claustrophobic as this phantom clawing at him is becoming stronger and stronger. It’s terrific work form the ever delicate Lumet.\n\nLet’s rewind a little bit. When Johnson finds the girl I found Connery’s acting really weird. She was withering and hysterically petrified at seeing this bulky stranger suddenly appear, and I was saying to Johnson “For Pete’s sake, tell her you’re a policeman, man!” In addition to this, some of his facial expressions and hand movements come off as a bit questionable, and when other officers arrive on the scene he had an odd shocked look on his face, almost shameful like you’d think he did it. And that’s exactly what it’s supposed to do! It’s only until you’ve seen the film in its entirety that you realize the nuance of Connery’s performance especially in the scene in the woods. It’s supposed to plant a seed in your mind, not a generalization or a declarative statement. Just a little raising of the eyebrow that makes you think “Hmmmm…?” And like the seed in the back of Connery’s mind, it grows and grows until suddenly the film’s uglier and darker side reveals itself. There is something very wrong with this man. It’s sad in a way because he doesn’t want to become what he thinks is, and he desperately searches for help. Ironically the one person who might understand him, who might’ve held up a clear mirror in front of him, is the suspected child molester Baxter. Maybe that’s why he launched himself at the suspect, because he was the only one who recognised Johnson for what he had become? Or maybe because Baxter could have exposed Johnson? Or maybe, as some lines of dialogue suggest, he sees himself in the molester? I mean, he does tell a fellow officer that the suspect’s mind “was crawling with pictures of that girl. Her naked body covered in mud.” The suspect never said this, and there’s no way he could have known that. He must’ve been projecting, subconsciously at that point in the film, his own thoughts and desires.\n\nOn a technical level The Offence has no cracks or holes. Lumet brings his A game, and the film has a kind of low-key, gloomy and depressing feel emphasised by the eerie an unorthodox score that often resembles the kind of constant bleep noise that those old PAL TVs would make when a program would end. You know how sometimes you have one of those days on a weekend where you wake up, it’s pouring down with rain, everything looks grey and gloomy and you feel like all the life’s been sucked out of the world. That’s exactly the feel that The Offense captures.\n\nJohnson’s breakdown as a result of his entertainment of disturbing and taboo thoughts implies that he identifies too closely with the kind of people he has spent his career putting behind bars. His inner turmoil is the centrepiece of the film. It’s only until you watch the whole movie that all the little things click into place, that everything makes sense. I found this movie to be a marvellous small-scaled character study of a very sick and corrupted man whose mind is driving him insane.\n\nI was thinking about giving it an 8 out of 10. But somehow it doesn’t really feel like an 8/10 movie. I suppose because I have so many of the great Lumet pictures at an 8 and this one doesn’t measure up when stacked up with the rest that I feel uncomfortable giving this an 8. But it is truly a magnificent psychological drama. I’ll settle at 7.5.\n\n",

I often see people trying to tie everything together and give the movie a bad review bc the strings do not attach to one another. \n\nNow, I'm not saying that this movie is a 100% grand slam. It isn't. I find the movie is flawed in tone at times and lacked a proper pace at times too. However, I found this movie to be a really good addition to the Cloverfield franchise. \n\nPersonally for me, this movie was kind of the catalyst that began the entire \"cloverfield*ism\" and sends everything out of whack for the other movies to be possible. Being that this franchise is an anthology kinda like The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror; I didn't try to connect every dot as I knew it wouldn't make sense. This, in my opinion, gauged my expectations and I found myself enjoying the movie for what it was. \n\nMost of the critiques I see for this movie are that the film leaves you with more questions instead of providing answers. But the movie is part of an anthology which, by definition, means \" a subgenre of films consisting of several different short films, often tied together by only a single theme, premise, or brief interlocking event (often a turning point). Sometimes each one is directed by a different director.\" \n\nYou wouldn't watch The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror and try to piece everything together. You know that the series doesn't work like that and you would be more confused trying to piece it together as opposed to just letting it be and taking it in for what it is. \n\nSO THE QUESTIONS THAT FOLLOW ARE:\n\n1.) Do you guys think the bad reviews are justified, or is it more that people are not fully informed that Cloverfield movies are part of an anthology? \n\n2.) Do you think the marketing is what threw people off? Because the marketing makes Paradox seem like a sequel to the first Cloverfield movie. \n",

To come closer to finding the good, true, and beautiful, especially in aesthetics. Without people to uphold what makes stories resonate, studios will just lose sight of it even more. That being said, it's unhealthy to keep accepting our \"I like it\" opinions as critical judgments.\n\nCitizen Kane &amp; 2001 didn't become classics for millions of \"I loved it\"s, but rather the technical &amp; emotional transcendence that was truly there. It may not appeal to everyone subjectively, but to discredit the objective power of ambiguity, contrasting shot composition, and seamless thematic coherence is kind of a discredit to filmmakers everywhere.\n\nIf we want to try eliminating the renowned \"toxic Internet fandom\", I think we should encourage more discourse &amp; left-side thinking, not \"I liked\" \"I hated\" back &amp; forth. Discussions go nowhere without reasoning, which of course, leads closer to a potential objective truth. A little more of this, and we can spark our understandings rather than pour more gas on the emotional flames.﻿\n\nWelp, what do y'all think?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7vwmzc/call_me_by_your_name_is_a_double_failure/",
        "text": "Number #1 on Letterboxd, #1 on IMDb, #3 on RYM, #3 on Filmaffinity, a 96% score on RottenTomatoes.\n\nIt pretty much seems like Call Me By Your Name is the film of the year. It has been discussed, 'analyzed' and praised to death by critics and public -especially public-, and it is already considered to be a contemporary LGTB classic.\n\nIn light of recent discussions on this sub about its triumphs, I feel compelled to say it: I hated like it. Not the way I hate movies like Project X or Ted for being disgusting *things*, but the way you dislike a veritable piece of art.\n\nIt's been commented here (well, only the OP of the post defended the opinion) that the film itself is conservative, burgeoise and reactionary. I don't completely agree (a queer romance is far from being conservative yet), but we need to get things straight: the film's narrative, cinematography and script are some of the most traditional and unnovative of the decade. We've seen a failed gay romance hundreds of times (notably, in 2005's melodrama Brokeback Mountain), we've all seen a straight woman shattered after being cheated by her queer lover (notably, in 2005's melodrama Brokeback Mountain). The propagandistic depiction of 80s Italy on the movie is not a new set for this class of romance, nor it represents any reality other than the cheeky and snobbish nature of the dispised social class that Elio belongs to (a family that switches between 4 languages as if by magic and with little coherence, and discusses the etymology of the word apricot as an ice-breaking conversation). Unnecessary and meaningless shots and blurry camerawork that don't make clear if they are an artistic choice or merely poor cinematographic skill. On top of this, we have an anachronistic and effectist score by tearjerker classic Sufjan Stevens.\n\nAll of thes thoughts lead to two conclussions:\n\nFirstly, the film contributes nothing to LGTB cinema and legacy (other than maybe in the economical aspect). Jarman, Fassbinder, Almodovar, Araki, Van Sant, Wong Kar Wai... even Xavier Dolan. Like them or not, all of them have made their efforts to construct and add meaningful elements to the queer cinematic tradition. This movie fails to do so, falling again and again in an Adam complex and tricking the audience into believing that the peach scene is some sort of revolutionary cinematic milestone. Gender gap has been already explored -and exploited, as Guadagnino does here, using the most fetishised gay kink ever as bait to attract controversy and viewers, as any big commercial release demands-. Other than that, the relationship between the main characters and its developement is nothing but average, idyllic and predictable since minute one, as well as Elio's sexual awakening.\n\nSecondly, if Call Me By Your Name succeeds at anything, is at recreating the imaginary of the so-called pejorative \"chick flicks\" in the mainstream gay cinema. You can see it everywhere: the poster; reminiscent of The Fault In Our Stars, the film's name (why do they even call themselves by each other's name? It isn't even explained), the dreamy set, the feel good vibe... An ideal and naive bubble of tranquility where homophobia does not exist, except perhaps in the mysterious interrogative spirit that refrains Oliver from fully accepting his love for Elio at the end of the film.\n\nCompared to other contemporary LGTB classics, such as Carol or Moonlight, Call Me By Your Name can't even compete. Now subjectively, the beauty and strength that the images of these two convey are alone far better than anything Guadagnino has to offer. If I were to write a short sentence to summarize my opinion, it would be **\"Call Me By Your Name fails to bring a solid artistic experience, and sadly disparages queer cinematic history\"**. A double failure, to the film world and the LGTB legacy.\n\nI won't be completely delusional, though. I must say that the movie improves at the second half, where childish gags and tropes are left behind and the director ventures into the realm of unsecurity and fear. That's probably the one thing the movie does well; portraying honestly the mind of a queer teen discovering his sexuality and the consummation of the first love. The actors (specially Thimothée) are good too.\n\nThese are some of my thoughts, I could go all day talking about things such as the almost comical female representation, the dark tradition of romanticizing old + young gay relationships or the absurd and incoherent parents' behaviour, the lack of social compromise in a perfect movie prone to introduce ideological protest... \n\nI pride myself of not being a contrarian, although that's the critique I recieve the most when I rant about the movie, so believe me when I say that that my disapproval is genuine and not born from the desire to stand out. I write this to create healthy discussion and perhaps be proven wrong.\n\nFeel free to express your opinion, please.\n\n\n(Edit: shoul've predicted the downvote shitstorm...)",

I really dig the concept of the film and I thought it fleshed it out in a decent way. I see that online, this film is getting a lot of hate and I really don't think it does. It does have its issues but they never really brother me to the point I wasn't invested on what happens next. Now to some degree, I can see why people don't like it. Some of the dislike of the film comes to its writer, Max Landis. Who I understand is a very polarizing person online. I don't know the guy personally, but he seems like a credible writer to me although the last film I saw that has his credits on was Chronicle. What I'm basically saying is I liked Bright. I enjoyed the film for what it is. It's not a perfect film nor would I'll say that its the best film I seen last year. (that goes to Blade Runner 2049). I give Bright a B-. If it has to a film that I like but everyone else hates, so be it. Come hell or high water. But I really would like to know what you all think about Bright. Do you like it or hate it? What is it that you dislike or like about? Let me know in the comments. This is a topic I'm want to get started.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7vk2en/okay_seriously_i_finally_watched_shape_of_water/",
        "text": "Yep, first of all, I have to admit I thought the movie was pretty shitty. If you, reading this post, personally liked it, that's fine. I'm not looking to attack others for their tastes, I just want to voice my opinion and hear what others have to say about it.\n\nI came to TrueFilm to see what other people were saying about this movie, and all I could see was either praising for elements that I found particularly underwhelming of the film, or praising for stuff that I just thought were too clichè, and was surprised to find are still being praised. Let me explain.\n\nAbout the underwhelming aspects: I mean, sure, the color palette was definitely the most interesting part of the movie, along with the monster's costume, but it's not like most other movies don't also use specific color palettes to add to their aesthetics, and compared to Blade Runner 2049 last year, or a movie like [The Double](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-double-2013/), by Richard Ayoade, this color scheme really doesn't stand out much. Maybe because here the color was linked to the water theme, and it made other red elements stand out? You can read more about it in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7llz2i/official_discussion_the_shape_of_water_spoilers/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) post, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7qetmp/the_shape_of_water_storytelling_through_color/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) post, both from other members of r/TrueFilm. There's also a lot of symbolism you can dive deep into from this and certain recurring props in the film, and some of the theories proposed are interesting, although I feel a bit far fetched at times. The cinematography and soundtrack were okay too. I mean, maybe as bare minimum as I expected from a renowed film maker like Del Toro, but nothing out of this world.\n\nSpeaking of 'out of this world', the monster had some interesting aspects too, and the costume was actually really impressive, especially because I can't seem to find reference to it being computer rendered. It seems it was actually [a latex suit all along](https://www.wired.com/story/shape-of-water-creature/), and holy Hell, that is f*cking great. Props to Mr. Del Toro, as well as production designers Paul D. Austerberry, David Best, Guy Davis, Samantha Dick, David G. Fremlin, Luca Nemolato, and Evan Webber, and also costume designer Luis Sequeira and make-up team Patricia Keighran, Jordan Samuel, and Kristin Wayne. I mean, credit where credit is due. ([Source](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-shape-of-water/crew/))\n\nOther than that, here are the shitty parts. (Or at least, the parts I found lacking, uninspired, and flat out lame.)\n\nEDIT: Ok, first, I want to thank the comments I've gotten so far about what I did write. I know I'm probably not gonna get any more comments after an edit made one day after posting, but still, I would like to finish my arguments. One thing I did forget to mention was that the acting overall wasn't bad, tho also not amazing, except for Sally Hawkins in that one scene where Elisa demands Giles' attention about why she thinks they should liberate the creature. It's easy to overlook that although the \"dialogue\" in the scene isn't that great, the fact that she pulled it all off without saying a word is noteworthy, and it was a pretty interesting scene. The use of J-cuts and other editing techniques mentioned by /u/calliewa and /u/lowerthirds completely went over my head, as I'm not really familiar with editing techniques at all, so I really appreciate that observation!\n\nNow, for what I wanted to say, while trying (and failing) to not go on for too long:\n\nThe characters are just bland and stereotypical, even when the movie tries to be good at \"breaking stereotypes\" and commenting on a bunch of social issues. I'm convinced that movies don't always need to have great characters to be good films (for example, Rogue One), but in The Shape of Water, they were precisely the core of the movie, and they're not really too developed; not even Elisa or the creature, who are literally the driving force of the entire narrative! I feel like the audience is left assuming and portraying their own ideals a lot on the relationship between these two. As an example, some of the posts I came about in this subreddit before I started writing mentioned how \"Eliza's [sic] love is like water; it can be contained, but once released, it bursts out- free and lively.\" ([Source from /u/Galactusurfer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7mhxwp/the_shape_of_water_analysis/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)), with [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7rfauo/xpost_from_rmovies_a_response_to_i_belong_where/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) talking along a similar vein. They talk about how Elisa's disability deprives her of others' love because they don't \"accept her for what she is\", until she meets the monster, who sees her in a \"primal way\", and isn't deterred from simply loving her, despite her imperfections. This is a nice interpretation, (and I don't mean to attack anyone, as these are perfectly valid), but there's just not much that tells us that other people \"rejected\" Elisa before she meets the monster. We never see her talking about past relationships, or trying to engage with others who don't \"see her for what she is\". Within the first moment of seeing the monster she is insanely compelled to get to know what it is, and then falls in love with it, or so it seems, by like the 2nd scene. I'm sorry, but this just isn't enough character development. The topic of inter-species romance is already weird enough, but then to not have it be explained even a bit? You just have to asume all of these things from seeing her masturbate to a timer in the mornings, I guess?\n\nAnother couple of things: regarding Giles being romantically interested in the young man from the cafeteria, it's attempted to be portrayed as him being lonely and repressed by a society that doesn't accept homosexuality, but the way he comes onto the guy all of a sudden is pretty aggressive, imho; and the guy does react in a concerned and angry manner, but doesn't verbally abuse Giles or anything. He just asks him to leave, as most other 20-something-year-old heterosexual men who are approached by some creepy 60-year-old out of the blue would so too. Although, then randomly a black couple comes into the restaurant and he yells at them and treats them like crap for trying to sit at the bar. Is he supposed to be an antagonist? Is this supposed to mirror both racism and homophobia? Because the racism is there, but the homophobia becomes practically untouched and comes off as cheap and superficial in the scene.\n\nRegarding the antagonist, Richard Strickland, he's portrayed as being \"trapped\" in conforming to other people's expectations of him and into the American Dream, and Elisa's love for the creature is represented as becoming \"free\" from that \"oppression\", that is barely and also superficially shown in some bland dialogue coming from Strickland about how he's more akin to God's image than the two cleaning ladies. Other scenes have him angrily fucking his wife, driving a square-shaped car that literally boxes him into his own ideas of himself, and manically ripping his rotting fingers off while demanding information from Zelda near the end of the film. He's always shown to have a superiority complex because of reasons one assumes have to do with the film taking place in the 50s and him being white and conforming, but we're never shown the reasons behind this attitude. He's not deep, he's just an angry asshole. And I think we just assume he's deep because it's a stereotype we've already seen played out many times now. Not that it's not an important issue, but this character is just a disservice to the complexity behind the problem of racism and conformity in the US, in my opinion.\n\nFinally, I want to address the issue of bestiality portrayed as \"fine\", or \"beautiful\", because that's what it is, and that's most of what left me feeling so uncomfortable after watching the film. I know many people might take it as it just \"being a movie\", as if that's not important or something. But the topic of this film is just way overboard and over the line to just not discuss fully. We're presented to this creature who can \"react to human language and emotion\", and who can express feelings and act in defence of those he loves. This way the creature is shown to be human-like, but you know what other creature can do the very same things? Dogs. The creature from The Shape of Water is essentially a giant pet with superpowers. It even eats a god damn cat and is excused from it because it \"doesn't know any better\", but yet it's shown as normal that a woman falls in love and has sexual relations with this thing, and it's even portrayed as her being \"liberated from oppression\" of some sort, which is waaay beyond where I personally draw the line. Idk, and I'd love to know what others think, although I know by now this post is just way too long for many to care, but I just want to know how far this acceptance of \"free thinking\" we're willing to take before we accept some pretty fucked up things in movies portrayed as \"normal\" and \"good\". I mean, not that violence isn't like that too in Hollywood. Now look at the way violence is understood in American society, and you see how films do truly have an impact on culture's values.\n\nMaybe for some I'm just taking this overboard, but all in all, this is what annoyed me the most in The Shape of Water, and it's mostly what I wanted to discuss with you in r/TrueFilm, to see what you guys and gals think. I don't know how many more people will read this, but I hope we can have at least a bit of discussion on the topic. Sorry there's no TL;DR, but I guess the most important point in the post is in the previous paragraph. Hope to read some of your comments soon.\n\nThank you for your attention :v",

        "author": "rkeaney",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7vj5lh/the_phantom_threads_woven_through_ptas_latest/",
        "text": "[Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccqxHENTzGc)\n\nPhantom Thread is the latest film by acclaimed auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, writer &amp; director of Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood &amp; The Master to name but a few. It reunites PTA with his There Will Be Blood star and three time oscar winner Daniel Day Lewis who has claimed that this will be his final film. \n\nIt follows the enigmatic and eccentric Reynolds Woodcock (played by Day-Lewis), a master dressmaker in 1950s London who creates garments for the rich and famous. Living with his sister in a grand London mansion, Reynold’s life is acutely designed to fit his particular needs and shield him from any potential distractions. When Reynolds meets his new muse, Alma, his obsessive and charismatic nature lures her into his unconventional, whirlwind existence but will he chew her up and spit her out like every woman who eventually bores him or will Alma prove to be more than the naive young waitress who caught his eye?\n\nThis film is a prime example of the stunning control and cinematic flair that PTA exhibits in his work. So much so that a narrative that would usually be an initial put-off for me is instead captivating, strange, unpredictable and absolutely intoxicating. There have been a lot of great performances in the last year but even some of the most noteworthy pale in comparison to the absolute masterclass on display with Daniel Day Lewis and his more than worthy co-stars Lesley Manville and Vicky Krieps. The film rides the fine line between being rigidly structured whilst retaining enough fluidity to make every moment seem malleable to the actors’ whims as though a semi-improvised stage play with stunning editing, sound design, cinematography and beautiful score by Radiohead’s Johnny Greenwood who has scored There Will Be Blood &amp; Inherent Vice for PTA in the past. Much like the acting, the score is intrisincally linked to the overall effect and success of Phantom Thread. Every aspect on display fits perfectly and Greenwood’s musical accompaniment is a huge factor in selling the film’s irresistible atmosphere. The dizzying piano melodies portray a world of privilege and style, something overwhelming and austere yet beautifully attractive at the same time. Similarly, the symphonies mirror the agitation and growing stress of Reynolds.\n\nRegarding the cinematography for which, unconventionally, PTA took the reigns yet declined to take credit for( citing his camera assistants and gaffer as hugely instrumental in the process)- it is absolutely stunning. Notable shots include a breathtaking new years eve party in a Chelsea theatre, the riveting driving scenes where Reynolds tears through the countryside with the camera rigged to the vehicle with near fish-eye lenses and the evocative use of extreme close ups. All of which- plus the many more stunning compositions in the film -tell the story visually with an assured control of cinematic language. Likewise, though PTA’s dialogue is fantastically biting, funny and effective, many pivotal acting moments rely heavily on silence and subtle facial ticks. Here,  PTA allows his fantastic cast room to show off their immaculate physical acting. One moment at the film’s climax is a perfect example of this where pitch perfect editing and captivating acting from Day Lewis and Krieps creates a silent war of wits, a breathtaking flirtation that fully involves the viewer without the need for dialogue. \n\nThe film starts a little slow but much like Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name, this is essential in selling the atmosphere of the film which before you realise it, has enveloped you like a beautiful boa constrictor, it’s nearly impossible to avert your eyes from the lavish delights on screen. As aforementioned, the interplay between Day-Lewis and his co-stars Manville and Krieps is spellbinding. The two actresses prove themselves more than up to the task of sparring with one of cinema’s all time greats and often coming out victorious. Manville and Day Lewis are fantastic and deserve the oscar nominations they have garnered. Day Lewis, I feel, could be even more deserving than current front runner Gary Oldman in his naturalistic, beguiling portrayal. However, the unsung hero of the film is Vicky Krieps, a relatively unknown Luxembourgian actor who, with Alma, takes the position of a conduit for the viewers’ reactions to Day Lewis’ impetuous yet captivating Reynolds. Krieps is by turns funny, sweet, intimidating and utterly empathetic. Alma’s relationship with Day-Lewis is without hyperbole one of the most involving and gripping cinematic romances of the last decade and Krieps’ evocative performance perfectly portrays the twists and turns in their tumultuous pairing. \n\nAs a master of cinematic language, PTA, much like Day-Lewis’ protagonist, sews the phantom threads throughout the film, placing sumptuous imagery in every scene. The use of food, consumption and inability to consume is a huge thematic signifier which is evident throughout some of the film’s most pivotal moments including the beautifully realised climax. Much like the treatment of food, control and lack thereof dominates the narrative. Reynold’s control of those around him as he dictates his every whim in creating his beautiful dresses while demanding ridiculous levels of obedience to his every need in order for him to be the creative genius he so vehemently wants to be seen are strong elements of Day-Lewis’ characterisation of him. Reynolds is undoubtedly a bully who seeks to exert this control and dominance over all those around him, yet he finds himself at his most satisfied and complete when the pendulum swings the other way. His impetuous lashing out at those who love and care for him most such as Alma &amp; Cyril is intriguingly counteracted by their refusal to be controlled and their ability to turn the tables making Reynolds the subject of their demands by contrast. Reynold’s thrives in this unconventional living situation. He is a child at heart, a mummy’s boy who wants to be cradled and re-assured so that he can recover to be the intimidating fashion idol that he portrays himself as to others.\n\nThe film has a lot to say about traditional gender norms, power, dependency and love and how each of these themes interact. PTA continues to prove his genius as a master filmmaker while Day-Lewis gives one of the performances of his career alongside the scintillatingly great Manville &amp; Krieps. By turns, hilarious, alluring, gorgeous and eccentric, Phantom Thread is sincerely one of the most exquisitely beautiful cinematic experiences I have had in recent years and I implore you to seek it out even if the subject matter seems dull or uninteresting to you at first glance.\n\nI’m going to give Phantom Thread 5 stars.\n\n[Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccqxHENTzGc)",

        "text": "I have many criticisms for this movie but the biggest outstanding flaw, and it's most egregious mistake, is that it cannot decide on what kind of movie it is. It's horror, and suddenly it's not, now it's a comedy. Instead of like most genre-blends, that major in one genre and minor in another, this film tries to straddle both but the equilibrium shifts so rapidly that it gives you whiplash. Witless jokes are used at attempt to diffuse the tension but only succeed at leaving a hanging awkwardness in the air so thick you could cut it with a knife. Even when characters aren't trying to make light of the situation the situation itself is so absurd it can help make you feel like this is some twisted black comedy but like I said, it just isn't that funny to begin with. \n\nAs for the ambitiousness of the film I dare anyone to try to make sense of the ending and how it relates to one or either of the two previous films, as it seems that was their intention. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that even if they fixed all that Hamilton's motivations are devoid of any real gravity when all her choices are subverted by the plot or her own choices. \n\nHere it goes, you ready?\n\nHamilton loses children in fire due to her own misjudgement. Hamilton finds out family exists in separate dimension but know she still has the husband back in hers. Hamilton has to choose between seeing her family and leaving her husband. Hamilton chooses to see her family not because she just wants to see them but because she has to save them from herself. Hamilton decides to leave but then has to choose between her crew and her family. Hamilton chooses her crew but finds out she can just send a message anyway so none of these decisions mattered anyway. \n\nYup. \n\nAnd guess what?! \n\nNone of this mattered anyway because even though they fixed the energy crisis the ocean monster appears to EAT THEM on the way down. I mean even if it didn't, everyone is still royally screwed probably because this thing is like 20,000 feet tall. \n",

        "text": "Spoilers ahead\n\nI saw this film for the first time a couple of weeks ago and it's taken a second viewing and hours of contemplation for me to fully digest it. Moonlight was undoubtedly my favorite film of last year, and I had mixed expectations for Call Me By Your Name because it would be hard to follow up what I consider to be a masterpiece LGBT drama. Honestly, I didn't quite like Call Me By Your Name when I first saw it because I kept making the connection to Moonlight but after a while I realized that although they may seem similar on the surface, they're nothing alike.\n\nThe more I thought about the film, the more I started to like it. Then, I had an experience that changed my view on it entirely. I'm 16 years old and I've been trying to get to know this girl I've had a crush on for months. This is probably the first time that I've ever felt that sense of infatuation with another person. We had been talking daily for weeks when I found out that one of my closest friends had asked her out. In this time, I'd had some incredibly intimate interactions with her, but now it was all for nothing. It may seem like a stupid thing but I was completely heartbroken. This is a new feeling to me tbh and I never truly related to it in movies or music until now. This experience left me shattered but when I went into my second viewing of Call Me By Your Name, I was able to appreciate it to a much greater extent.\n\nThe atmosphere of the entire film is masterfully crafted. It made me feel incredibly nostalgic for a time period I was never there to experience and a place I haven't really ever been to. The only other films that have made me feel this way are Richard Linklater's works like Dazed and Confused and the Before Trilogy. Being able to connect these emotions on a raw level to my own life definitely amplified the experience for me. This is one of the few films that gets the fleeting feeling in your heart so right. The pacing of this film is perfect, from a structural point of view. The first half of the story feels slow and indulgent but the second half flashes past in an instant, just as it did for the characters.\n\nElio and Oliver's chemistry in the movie was fantastic. I found the age gap between the characters to be slightly disturbing the first time around but I don't think that was much of a problem because the characters seem to have the same level of emotional maturity even though one is older. I thought that both Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet nailed their characters. A movie of this nature requires a certain level of sensitivity from the director and the actors involved while handling characterization and they really did pull it off very believably.\n\nThe ending, to me, is perfect. From Michael Stuhlbarg's brilliant monologue to Chalamet's breathtaking long-take of crying into the fire, I wouldn't change a thing about it. That phone call really, really, REALLY fucking got to me the second time I saw the film because of my own situation. I have never felt this empathetic for a character; I could viscerally relate to every move and thought of his in the final act. Something that he held so dear to himself was being ripped away from him to no fault of his own, and all he could do is sit there and watch. This film immensely helped me deal with my own situation and is a large part of why I'm mostly over it. It's exactly what I needed right now. I love it so fucking much. I hope it is not undermined because of the success of its predecessor at the Oscars because it really is a beautiful work of cinema.",

(And the same could be said for the original Star War was, as one-off stories inspired from serials, and comic books)  \n\n***  \n\nEdit: I keep saying \"40s\" in this thread, but I mean to say \"30s~40s\".",

        "text": "So, for anyone here who has seen the movie No Tears for the Dead, what was your interpretation of the ending? The movie suggests near the end that Gon dies, as he has been shot an excessive amount of times and is bleeding heavily. However, the following frame shows him in the ruins of the bathhouse, reminiscing about his mother. Earlier in the movie, he is shown going to this bathhouse, however there is nothing to suggest that the scene we see in the end is actually attached to the same scene in which we see him at the bathhouse earlier in the film. \n\nMy interpretation of the ending is that he is still alive and revisiting the bathhouse again, and that he is reminiscing about his mother as a consequence of what he has effectively taken away from a little girl. The movie shows scenes in which people take considerable damage and are bleeding about as much, if not more than Gon, and they are later revealed to still be alive. Therefore, in the trend the movie has set for itself, it opens the possibility of Gon's survival, especially since he is seen in the second to last scene going down an elevator, where police and ambulances would have been at the bottom floor, making it reasonable that he would have had immediate healthcare attention.\n\nSo I was wondering, what is the opinion of the reddit community?",
