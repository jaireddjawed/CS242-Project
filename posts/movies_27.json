It's been revised and edited numerous times, even by a professional. If there are book readers in this forum, do let me know if you're interested in taking an early sneak peak.

        "text": "So I caught Damian Chazelle's sprawling and overlong Babylon, which is basically a self indulgent love letter/movie history lesson, with too many main characters and plotlines, which with some heavy editing would have been enjoyable. Criticism aside, Tobey Maguire's small role as a sleazy underworld figure who lends some money to Manny, and things soon get out of hand. I've always been interested by Maguire, ever since his starmaking turn in Sam Raimi's Spiderman, and he put in an admirable turn in The Great Gatsby. His involvement in the scandal of Molly's Game made me change my opinion of the spandex wearing everyman, and in Babylon he looks to be channeling his inner Evil Peter Parker in his role in Babylon. Honestly, I found his portrayal fascinating, and could have happily watched more, but Chazalle had other ideas, as he jumped from main character to main character, leaving the viewer overwhelmed by the misdirection by the filmmakers. This is all a leadup to a question, what is your favorite small parts which amde watching a mostly boring or long movie enjoyable?",

Don't get me wrong. I don't remember last time a movie really scared me. This one did. I love Hereditary and think it is a very disturbing movie, but even that didn't scare me or disturbed me - all because I knew it was a horror movie and was prepared. When watching Hereditary, I appreciated the movie. When watching Missing, I felt the movie. \n\nIt has some funny elements in it. They were maybe not so well done (idk) but because I knew nothing about the movie, they catched me off-guard and I found myself laughing alot (scared and laughing, don't seem a possible combination, but this movie did it). \n\nShortly, it was the best experience ever, only because I knew nothing. After I watched the movie, I watched the trailer and also found out it was a sequel to Searching (2020). Thanks god, I didn't know that before.\n\nEven though the trailer doesn't really reveal major plot points, it actually does ruin experience. For example, Kevin Lin being a suspect (HAD NO IDEA DURING THE MOVIE AND WAS SHOCKED), the mother being a suspect (SHOCKED ME EVEN MORE) and so on. There are many scenes in the trailer that would just sit in the back of my head and made me prepared for all the shock points. \n\nI am looking forward to Beau is Afraid but unfortunately, I know it will be a good movie and that ruins it for me. I know Ari Aster and I have watched the trailer. Maybe, even though it had a better potential of fucking up with me, it wont fuck me up as much as Missing, only because I know more.\n\nWho agrees with this?",

I got lost watching “Cloud Atlas”, didn’t understand it and I really despised it because of that. Then a few weeks passed, and I realized I was still thinking about the film. Then I decided I HAD to see it again, so I did, and suddenly it all made sense. I picked up on all the details I missed the first time, I followed the storylines with ease, I noticed the themes of slavery, oppression and predation, I just got it.

        "text": "Honestly, it is one of the more interesting movies when it comes to how I feel about it because when it comes to its message and stuff, I am pretty mixed. Specifically, in how much I should like kinda empathize with the protagonist, who is like meant to be like a clear portrayal of a very flawed but kinda redeemable individual but I actually think this dude is like a big piece of shit. In fact, in another story, I could easily see him in the role of that one deadbeat dad who is just useless to the protagonist and is only meant to further reinforce just how miserable he is. The guy is not just permissive and is still friends with a guy who literally murdered a Korean couple for no good reason and finds amusement out of seeing himself murdering them on tape, this dude is also himself a murderer and in the movie, it kinda goes with this idea that yeah, this dude may be involved in some criminal shit but he cares for his girlfriend and the kid but no, this dude would actually be terrible as a father and husband. He gives his stepson a fucking gun and teaches him into becoming into more like him, he cheats on his girlfriend with another girl who he later gets pregnant and when he finds out that the girl is pregnant on a phone call with her, he quickly ditches as if she were nothing. And then when a friend of her confronts him about it, he assaults him. And I am meant to think this dude is in the process of change and a better life? Nah nah nah nah nah. This guy sucks lmao. He really sucks. And maybe that may be the point but man, it didn't feel like that's what it was going for. Yes, the narrative is aware he does shitty things and yes, he needs time to change, especially in his circumstances but I also feel it kinda has this hope that the character wants to do better for himself and others the more it goes on but instead, he just does more shitty things and doesn't suffer the real consequences until the very end &gt;!when he gets murdered as he is protecting his stepson as a showing some good in him.!&lt; What's also sad is that the girlfriend never comes to really realize just all that he has done and how he wouldn't be the right person to take with him due to his influence to his very son and with all the trouble he has caused for himself and others. Personally, I think this kind of message was better handled in Boyz In The Hood and it does a better job at making me empathize with a murderer and incredibly flawed individual in this film as there is more of a cohesive reason why the character should be seen as a kind of tragic figure despite of being consumed by the violence around him.\n\nAnother problem for me, I guess, is that it does feel a bit super indulgent in its nihilism, which works as a double edged sword in this film in that it makes the life in the hood and those in the hood into such a hopeless and violent wasteland that feeds off the pain of its neighbors and can only think to further run the cycle (Although, it is at the same time, the point of it all since well, it is hard and it can definitely feel that way as someone living that experience.)\n\nHowever, despite my big problem with the protagonist, I was never bored watching the movie. There is this oppressive grimness to it that just captures well how really bad the life for black folks is in their neighborhood and that this is a thing that will keep happening. And it does have pretty darn good production design for a early 90s film. And while it is pretty moralistic at times, it does have good stuff to say like how yes, the police is fucking bad and racism is still prevalent in America but then again, I feel a lot of these movies do this already because well, black people already fucking know America ain't post-racial and police being a bunch of pigs who also protect other pigs' piggie banks.",

Like if someone asked you to explain why, you wouldn't even be able to bullshit a half smart-sounding reason. \n\nMe the one that most did this was Terrence Malik's Tree of Life. I've seen it three times, I can broadly outline the events shown in the movie, and the only real takeaway I ever get from it is \"pretty music, pretty imagery, heartstrings pulled.\" Like I have no idea how a scene where a dinosaur spares the life of another dinosaur ties in with the other events or themes of the movie, etc. But all the sort of dreamlike, weightless handheld footage around the childhood home of Sean Penn's character is more or less how my brain recorded my outdoor childhood memories, even though I was a child during a way later era. As far as intellectual stimulation goes, I might as well be watching a meditation video.",

        "text": "Diane is dreaming she is Rita not Betty. The movie follows very strict rules about this for about the first hour. Every scene that doesn't feature Rita either takes place immediately after she falls asleep, closes her eyes, etc. or she can hear it. The scene with the accident detectives is shown after she's fallen asleep. Same with Winkie's. The eyebrow man Dan is actually Diane dreaming she's Rita who is then having a dream within the dream where Dan is describing another dream then suddenly realizes he's still dreaming. &gt;!Lynch'd!&lt; The hobo behind Winkie's is actually Camilla's reanimated corpse. She lives behind Winkie's because that's where the blue key was left for Diane which would signify that the murder was completed. That's why he laughs at Diane when she asks what it opens. Because she's so naive that she doesn't get that he means its to simply communicate with her secretly. \n\nLots more. In this thread we will prove every facet of Mulholland Drive beyond a shadow of a doubt. \n\nBut a little more about what Rita can hear. The movie practically beats us over the head with this. When Betty is on the phone with her aunt learning that Rita is not supposed to be there, the camera makes a long and slow tracking shot all the way down the hallway and into the bedroom as Betty's voice trails behind. This is to make it very obvious that big surprise Rita can hear them from the bedroom. Then right before Betty and Rita meet each other, the entire courtyard scene with Cocoa is practically yelled and sometimes is literally yelled. For example, Betty never goes into Cocoa's home. She just stands outside and literally yells at her through the screen door. Rita may not be in this scene but it is still from her perspective because she can still hear it.",

Therefore we were hoping that we could watch a compilation of all the announcements before I leave for work in the morning. Watching the announcements happen and seeing how is correct is more exciting than just scrolling through a website :)\n\nWhat are the best places to watch a compilation?\n\nI hope somebody could help me!",

Basically, anything **YOU** thought was badass, for whatever reason, and why!? A great character arc or moment? A final stand? A duel? A reveal of some sort? Something more subtle? \n\nThe scene that made me want to post this was a scene from The Exorcist (1973) that lives rent free in my head. It's towards the end - the afflicted daughter (Reagan) is upstairs howling, and everyone left alive is downstairs in utter despair - things are not going well. The mother, distraught, turns to Father Karras and asks, \"is she going to die?\" and he says solemnly, \"No.\" Then he begins to ascend the stairs alone, to do battle against evil and hopefully bring this poor girl back.\n\nI tried to find the exact scene to link, but couldn't find it. So perhaps I got some of the dialogue wrong, but that's the gist of it - and it gives me chills.",
