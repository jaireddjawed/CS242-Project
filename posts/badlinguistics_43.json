        "text": "Andrew Graham-Dixon has a new art series out called [Art of China](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2014/30/art-of-china). He's actually one of my favorite presenters, and I've learned a great deal about art thanks to his documentaries (his series on modern art was particularly enlightening for me). However in his newest one he gets some things drastically wrong about language. \n\n\n**15:11**. Chinese language is one of the three great pictographic languages (cuneiform, hieroglyphics) and is the only one to survive. In the process it's become the foundation of continuity in Chinese civilization.\n\nYes, because Chinese civilization of 2014 is soo much like Chinese civilization of 1914, which itself was soo much like the Chinese civilization of 1814, 1714, 1614, 1514, etc.\n\n**15:20**: The most basic form of Chinese art is the Chinese language\". \n\nNever mind that you'd just spent the previous 15 minutes talking about the [fabulous](http://i.imgur.com/AS1oriO.jpg) [works](http://i.imgur.com/PftRJKJ.jpg) of [art](http://i.imgur.com/utUCBH9.jpg) from the ancient city of [Sanxingdui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxingdui) which *wasn't* a literate civilization. \n\n**15:52** Chinese writing freezes ancient moments in history because it's a picture language.\n\nThe implication here is that people who write in Chinese see the characters and think of the ancient history of those characters. The second implication is that other languages *don't* do this because they're not picture languages. \n\n\n**16:30** The Chinese language stayed fixed because it was a set of pictures. \n\nNever mind that you'd already talked about so-called [\"Oracle Bone Script\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script), which is *not* modern Chinese, though it's perhaps the oldest known examples of Chinese writing. \n\n**16:38** The Chinese language is immune to pronunciation change because it's a picture language.\n\n1.) How exactly does a picture help someone with pronunciation again? Oh wait, it doesn't. You still have to learn the pronunciation from people.\n\n2.) Wouldn't a writing system with words be better at preserving pronunciation because you can guess at pronunciation based on the words? And we all know how *that* works out.\n\n3.) Do the Chinese have some magical ability to see a pictogram and know how to say the word?\n\n**17:00** The written language has always been the bedrock of Chinese civilization. \n\nNever mind that the Chinese written language has changed even within the 20th century, and that new forms of words are added constantly. What happened to Chinese culture before 1200 B.C.E. (date of the Shang dynasty)/ How can writing be the bedrock of Chinese civilization if most of it's people weren't literate?\n\n**17:09** It's creation was a key to controlling a vast population. \n\nHuh. Those poor Inca. How did they ever manage to control such a vast empire without a written language?\n\n**17:40** Thanks to their written laws the Shang were able to take control of and organize huge swathes of territory around the Yellow River Valley. \n\nYeah, I'm sure it had nothing whatsoever to do with armies, or control of food production, or military leadership, or the lack thereof in their opponents. It was writing that was the key to success. \n\nEdit: or the fact that the Shang dynasty was the first dynasty in China to have chariots. ",

        "text": "I've been reading Joseph Plumb Martin's *Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier*, which is a memoir he wrote in 1830 about his war service. He joined the Continental Army on July 6, 1776 at the young age of 15 and served through the entirety of the war, fighting in many of the major battles of the war.\n\nHe's one of the few ordinary soldiers to leave a complete account of his war service and his journal has become a valuable resource. Plus the man has an engaging turn of phrase, such as in this paragraph where he talks about his education.\n\n&gt;The critical grammarian may find enough to feed his spleen upon, if he peruses the following pages; but I can inform him beforehand, I do not regard his sneers; if I cannot write grammatically,**I can think, talk and feel like other men. Besides, if the common readers can understand it, it is all I desire;** and to give them an idea, though but a faint one, of what the army suffered that gained and secured our independence, is all I wish. I never studied grammar an hour in my life, when I ought to have been doing that, I was forced to be studying the rules and articles of war.\n\n&gt;As to punctuation, my narrative is in the same predicament as it is in respect to the other parts of grammar. I never learned the rules of punctuation any farther than just to assist in fixing a comma to the British depredations in the State of New-York; a semicolon in New-Jersey; a colon in Pennsylvania, and a final period in Virginia;—a note of interrogation, why we were made to suffer so much in so good and just a cause; and a note of admiration to all the world, that an army voluntarily engaged to serve their country, when starved, and naked, and suffering every thing short of death, (and thousands even that,) should be able to persevere through an eight years war, and come off conquerors at last! But lest I should make my preface longer than my story, I will here bring it to a close.\n\nNot quite the normal fare for /r/badlinguistics, but I thought we could use some more historical bad linguistics (or in this case the railing against said badlinguistics).

In the example sentence, the author set the three ratios to 1.0 and then used *is*. While I sympathetic to this choice, it strikes me that the sentence still needs an *are*. Is this a clear cut situation, or is the use of *is* defensible?\n\nA question unrelated to the first: if I want to understand the common features of an American dialect, what source would I look to?i've spent the last week with some of my extended family. I have a teenaged niece conjugating verbs differently than I would, but I suspect she's being consistent with most of the people she speaks with. Someone else keeps correcting her to more standard conjugations. Is there something that will let me understand whether my niece is speaking consistently with a local dialect?",

        "author": "thewimsey",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/2bysxu/the_ipee_dialect_meta/",
        "text": "Due to the nature of badlinguistics, a lot of different dialects are discussed in this sub.  SAE comes up a lot, as the prestige dialect.  AAVE may be the most frequently officially recognized dialect discussed in this sub, mostly because its users are the most criticized.  Appalachian dialects, some Midwestern dialects, and some Southern dialects are also frequently discussed, for mostly the same reasons as AAVE, although the precise examples criticized are usually different (typically some variation of \"I seen\").  Differences between BrE and AE are also touched upon.\n\nBut the dialect that is, IME, the most frequently discussed dialect on this sub is never named.  I'm not even sure that it has a name.  \n\nThe dialect is, of course, Imaginary Prescriptivist Editorial English.  Or IPEE for short. (Although there may be better names.  I'm not sure that there are better acronyms). \n\nI've tried to identify a few characteristics of this dialect, although it would be a dissertation level project to identify all of them.\n\n* Prepositions may not be used at the end of a sentence.  Possibly they may be used at the end of clauses, though, as that is never criticized.  So \"Hurry up!\" is incorrect in IPEE, but \"Hurry up; we're going to the mall\" seems to be perfectly correct.\n\n* Infinitives may never be split.  Because Latin. Also because recursiveness; you wouldn't want to split an infinitive even if it were correct because someone reading it might believe that it is incorrect and think that you are uneducated.\n\n* Word choice is binary (if not Manichean).  If you can say \"which\", it is not proper to say \"that\".  And vice versa.  Same with \"fewer\" and \"less\"; because there are some circumstance under which only \"less\" may be used (\"He has less money than me\"), the IPEE binary principle requires that in those situations where fewer may be used, *only* fewer may be used, and less is incorrect. \n\n* Words only mean their dictionary definitions.  But not their *actual* dictionary definitions, like you might find in an actual dictionary, as dictionary writers are untrustworthy.  Words only mean what they originally meant, which may be determined in a variety of ways, including by looking at the etymology. Preferably a Latin etymology, because educated people know Latin. Figurative meanings are right out. So of course \"literally\" only has one meaning, and its obvious what that meaning is because the word comes from the Latin \"littera\", which means \"letter of the alphabet\".  But also \"epistle\".  And also \"literature\".  And also a \"public document\".  And,well, a \"dispatch\".  Oh, it also means an \"ordinance\". And of course \"edict\", generally.  Also, it means \"scholarship\". \n\nSo it's obvious that \"literally\" can only have one meaning in IPEE.  \n\n* The passive voice is eschewed in IPEE, because it's weak and unmanly.  Or something like that.  But because it's hard to actually know (to know actually? actually to know?) what the passive is, at least for IPEE speakers, the language also seems to prohibit the use of constructions that are *kind of like* the passive.  \n\nSo in IPEE, one shouldn't say \"John was seen at the store.\" But apparently one should also not say \"John was reluctant to go to the store\" or \"It was relatively easy to go to the store.\"  For examples, see [Pullum](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html)\n\n* Shibboliths (a/k/a purity tests). This point relates perhaps more to the culture of IPEE speakers than to the content of the language itself, but I think it is important to mention as it may be the most striking feature about this dialect. A consistent trait of IPEE speakers is their strong tendency to publicly correct people who do not speak the IPEE dialect.  This is an unusual, if not unique, feature in nonstandard dialects.  Native speakers of certain Southern dialects are not corrected if they inadvertently say \"I saw him\" rather than \"I seen him\". This appears to be true even for nonstandard dialects in other languages as well: Swabian speakers are not, IME, publicly corrected for saying \"Ganget mi' heim\" rather than \"ganget mi' hoim.\" \n\nBut IPEE speakers feel compelled to \"correct\" speakers of almost any other English dialect, in an apparent attempt to either (sorry, either to): (1) force the person to speak IPEE; (2) ridicule the person for not speaking IPEE; or (3) indicate that the corrector is a speaker of IPEE. (Or perhaps to do all three).\n\nThis is a peculiar behavior, much more akin to the behavior of certain religious adherents than to the behavior of people who just happen to speak a particular dialect in an environment where speakers of other dialects also exist.\n\nAt the risk of being a bad amateur sociologist, I have to wonder whether IPEE did not develop from a population of medieval monks who were somehow isolated for a long enough that they developed their own dialect (let's call it proto-IPEE).  Although I don't have any empirical or archaeological evidence to support this theory, it would explain: (1) the need to publicly witness; (2) the belief that IPEE is the one true language; (3) the (barely concealed) belief that people who do not speak IPEE are sinners who need to be redeemed; (4) the reliance on dictionaries; (5) the intolerance of ambiguity;  (6) the reverence for Latin forms; and (7) the overall belief that \"sinful\" man has turned his back on the one perfect language.\n\n",
