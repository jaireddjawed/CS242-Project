        "text": "So hear me out. Wikipedia is a huge part of the way most people get their information, which is why we care about whether it's biased. We would rather people got their information from professional sources than from a bunch of volunteer amateurs on the Internet.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n*Even if the mainstream media is biased, Wikipedia editors aren't the best people to fix that problem. It's too big for them, beyond the skill of all but a few, and we can't verify skills or credentials for most of them anyway.\n\n*Wikipedia's rules for what counts as a reliable source are for the most part reasonably good.\n\nConclusion: So if Wikipedia or a given part of Wikipedia is exactly as biased as the mainstream media that makes up its source material, that means everything is working. The editors are doing their jobs as curators-not-creators of information and Wikipedia is merely part of any large, culture-level bias problem rather than creating or exacerbating it.\n\nDiscuss.\n",
