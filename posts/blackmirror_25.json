She should have just not answered the door and pretended to not be in the house (who thought a glass pane on the door like that is a good idea anyways), or after she opened said that she had no idea what she was talking about to get her to leave. \n\nAfter she admitted she saw the accident, that was likely it for her. But her second biggest mistake was agreeing to the terms and conditions of the memory device (I mean if there are terms and conditions that means it's optional right?). Once she saw her memories, there's no way the insurance agent would have kept quiet - and killing the insurance agent was obviously going to open a can of worms for her.\n \nSure, killing her ex-bf was her first major mistake, as the risk of getting found out for the act and punishment is greater than letting her boyfriend send the anonymous letter, but it seems like she managed to get away with it, as it seems like her ex-bf is a broken man and probably no one would have noticed or cared that he was missing.",

        "text": "Edit: Yes it could be more broadly interpreted to fit crime in general\n\nFirst of all, I could be totally wrong about this, so disclaimer.\n\nThat said, I think many of you are missing one of the main social commentaries that the episode portrays.\n\nFirst a Summary\n\nWe are introduced to the episode to a Human being. She puts on shoes, drinks water, etc. The girl is a human being and we are supposed to empathize with her (yes her acting isnt the best, but acting aside) as she seems confused and disoriented. Then she is lead on that crazy chase from those \"scary\" mass murderers and we are supposed to sympathize with this (till now) helpless victim who did nothing wrong. Everyone else seems to simply watch/record her and ignores her plea for help. At the end its revealed shes actually a terrible person who watched an innocent kid be killed as the \"Host\" is treated to loud applause and adoration from the public. And then the cycle repeats.\n\nThe beginning of the episode was meant to make you realize that regardless of what she has done, she is still a human being. Suddenly, she is thrown into a world where none seem to acknowledge her status as a human. The chase and the constant fear that she undergoes is a form of psychological torture. Until this point we are rooting for the character to stay safe and whatnot. The theme park crew throw subtle hints at what she did (the woods with the hanging people), and it is eventually revealed that she is a someone who went along with killing a child, a heinous act. However, she did NOT actually kill the child. Her crime was recording it and doing nothing to stop it. She is captured and the amusement park host is treated like a celebrity. He is adored, respected, and loved although he is doing what we all know he is doing. Then the psychological torture repeats.\n\nIMHO, The Show was trying to draw the attention to our treatment of those guilty of heinous crimes (particularly: international terrorists). At the end of the day, they like us are human beings. Like the character, they are also guilty of heinous acts. BUT, what it was trying to point out was your initial feeling of sympathy for the character. Was the torture justified? Was there not a sense of hypocrisy that everyone who paid to get into the theme park recorded her torture, similar to what she did to the child? It also points out, that they all are aware of what is going on. They simply do not protest it, and instead sponsor it. Similarly, we all are well aware of Abu Ghraib and the torture that goes on there but we are willing to turn a blind eye to human rights violations because we think of them as humans less than us. I saw the host as a symbol of the world leadership (in particular the US president). He is adored, respected, loved and FOLLOWED by the majority. At the same time, he is also sponsoring the torture that we are well aware of at Abu Ghraib. He conducts the same gruesome treatment (indirectly) [but the show does it directly to make it more powerful] that we punish terrorists for. Yet he is adored, because he does it in the name of \"Justice\", and its important to point out that he most likely is profiting from the torture. (He seems like the owner of the park?). Their crimes ironically are the same, they are both guilty of standing by and watching a person be tortured. And then the story repeats, similar to how the torture in Abu Ghraib is endless.",

Later, to test the blurring function, she turns on what is clearly footage from S3E5 Men Against Fire. I thought every episode was set in the same universe. Is this relevant? Did it explain that the events in Men Against Fire is just a TV show? If not, why would they be watching those events and HOW would they be watching those events?

You know there is something sexual behind it, but really doesn`t know why. \nDuring the entire episode i searched for where this sexual thing, that sounds rapey, was found? So, i thought it would be Hector, or the Black guy in the motorcycle, or that dude in the forest.\nBut i would never think of sweet Kenny, of course. \nThe entire episode is built arround Kenny`s mask, and it does it so perfectly well. He is the classic Nice guy, who is gentle with kids and is shy, etc. \nBut, to me, the greatest thing this episode does is how it builds Tension in the right way. You follow Kenny`s madness during every scene, and it grows with him (Thanks to the actors amazing perfomance as well). It reached a peak for me when he had to rob that bank, that the director does a more close up shot on kenny, capturing every bit of fear and madness that he is feeling. \nThe ending is amazing too. The \"trollface\" thing was a brilliant way to tell the audience \"Those hackers are doing it anyway\" but it a very subtle way, just perfect to close a episode. \nThe hardest part for me is seeing kenny not even running, just walking, giving up on everything and accepting his new life, that its doomed forever.\nI probably think too much about this episode, `cause it was one of the best things i've seen in a while =p.",
