Anyone read this full book before? Is it worth slogging through the next 97 pages to the more modern era section?\n\nI think backstory can be valuable, but it’s feeling like a pointless info-dump without context of why all these childhood details are going to be important in the future. Are the upcoming revelations truly earth-shattering?",

They said it had automatons/robots, and specifically, there was something to do with different coloured vials, and these would change what the automaton/robot would do. There was a black vial, which apparently was a bad vial to use, but someone in the book used it. They don't remember much else other than they think it's a series, but they only read one book. \nIf anybody knows any details or knows the author and title of the book I would be really appreciative I'm hoping to give this as a gift to them as they have been trying to find it for so long.",

The main character's are Soviet and Nazi soldier's. I can't remember how then ended up in this situation, but eventually one of them is wounded and they become obligated to care for each other. Putting aside their differences, former enemies are traveling through snowy field (it might also was frozen lake) only horse they have dies, and solders ending up in the village, where execution is about to happen. Somehow they separate. Then, during separation I believe it was Soviet one who betrays Nazi one, by telling villagers that he is in fact, part of Nazi. His friend is captured by peasants, and just before the noose around his neck is tightened, he sees Soviet solder in pandemonium of viewer's, realising treachery. \n\nOther addendums: I'm pretty sure it was written by slavic author, probably russian one. Also the book was probably bigger then I described probably around five hundred pages. \n\nI would greatly appreciate any clue about the name of it, thank you in advance.",

I want to grow old with him I want to be willow trees swaying in the wind watching as our seeds grow and as the world crashes and burns but somehow never burns us down I want us to stand through it all. I never want to let go I want to hold on forever because the words goodbye might just kill me slowly breaking the bark off my trunk.

I've enjoyed gaming most my life but just got fed up of it and I've always wanted to try and read books. \n\nI got mega into reading and was loving it. Fast forward 4 years later and I got given a steam deck which is a handheld gaming pc and it's really good. \n\nI work 6 days a week so I don't get a lot of time anyway but if I ever have any spare time I always just pick up a handheld now rather than a book. \n\nAnother problem is if I read a book for longer than half hour I start to fall asleep. Doesn't matter what time of day or how much I'm enjoying a book where as I can spend a couple hours playing video games easily without any sign of tiredness. \n\nThis is why it takes me like a month to read a 300-400 page book and I know I could do that book in a few days easily.",

I love everything about the book and I love the entire series even more after the chaos that just ensued, but wow I don't think I've ever read a canonical pair as bad of a match as Molly and Fitz. I think the part in this book where she ended things with him for good (hopefully, but I doubt it) and mentioned how she was kind of treated like a hobby by Fitz just solidified my thoughts about this relationship making no sense. I don't blame either of them, it's just that both have their own priorities/needs that I don't think the other can compromise or surpass. \n\nI'm also a bit more biased with Fitz as I've been in his head for a while now, but at the same time, while I don't hate Molly, I'd say for sure she's the character I like the least. It's weird cause she's the MC's love interest, so I thought I'd be rooting for her more often but I simply don't really care about her as I do the other characters. Her childhood and relationship with Fitz were interesting to read about in the beginning but in this book especially, I feel like she's the only character Fitz is close to who is completely cut off from literally everything going on with him, and most of her moments in the book are either of her fighting with Fitz or having sex with him.  I just feel like she's a super odd character in this entire story and wish she could at least have been a little more involved or fleshed out.",

Can anyone relate? \n\nI’ve realized that a good fix for my problem might be reading multiple books at once. Right now I’ve been trying with 2 books, one a slow burn fantasy and the other an action sci-fi. So far I’ve been reading for an hour with one and then swapping to read an hour with the other. I’m 200 pages into each and it’s worked fairly well, but I feel like I’m not being as productive as I could be, if that makes sense? It feels like there’s a better way to go about this. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice for reading two books at once? Or maybe even any advice on breaking my burnout habit? \n\nThanks.",

Below the vineyards, the houses of the town on the narrow plain along the lake shore.

The river grew still wider and a grass plain stretched out on both banks. Clusters of sparkling reeds grew like little groups of people. They had taken root in even the minutest mounds of dry ground by the river bed. Their delicate cilia, blown off by the wind, hovered playfully about the ears of the plants before being wafted away into the distance. A hill stood by itself next to the river.

I knew that I loved stories. But my limited attention span always drew me to stories in movies, TV, and video games instead of books. \n\nRecently I jumped the gun and decided to read a very big sci-fi book. While it was a very rewarding experience, I felt that I jumped very high than what is probably my current reading level. I would like to not only develop a habit and patience for reading, but also gradually move my way up to what are considered classics. \n\nI'm not sure what exactly are the levels to this, but what would you recommend as starter material for my situation. Please don't be afraid to recommend Children's or YA books. I would like to build steps up to where I'd like to be. My genres of interest are sci-fi, fantasy, and nonfiction history.",

        "text": "I’m writing this in pure appreciation to the book and to my English class. I know Gatsby is one of the most popular books, but it really makes sense on why it is. There is something so special and magical about the book and how it holds up to day. And I think part of me has to thank my English class for that. Getting the history on the author F Scott Fitzgerald really just made the book so much more enjoyable because I was able to find so many parallels between him and Gatsby. I can literally talk about the book for hours and I love hearing other people from my class and other classes talk about the book. I wasn’t the only one who was so impacted on it. And I think one of the best parts about it is that so many different generations have read it so you can talk about it with so many different people. I had a great conversation with my grandfather about the book and he really understood how I felt about it.  We both agreed on how, as a man especially, you can relate to Gatsby. With his desire, his passion, and his mystery, he truly is such a great character. This book is so special to me and has even sparked a new interest in reading(which I always found hard for me to do). Growing up in elementary school reading was used as a punishment, but now I feel so different about it. I truly want to read and learn. There’s so much out there and it makes me so happy.\nThank You Gatsby :)",

I want to say more but don't want to take away from the experience for people who have not read the book. \n\nBut that's not the only type of creativity I'm talking about either. I mean the creative aspect may be just about the story or the world where the action takes place. Of course, the book could even be nonfiction (e.g., instructional) or link science and art in unusual ways. The drawings or figures used may be imaginative and just dazzling. In fact, those are the books I often enjoy the most because reality limits your creativity, so you have to really come up with something new, like the relationship between math and music, to be considered original and inventive.\n\nLet me end with one last example: I never read Ulysses but watching a video about how Joyce planned and layered the book was astonishing.  There are so many reference and symbols, I think the book must be considered a work of art of some sort.",

I had hoped I could have left them to my own family or cousins but one of them doesn't even know how to read the clock and most don't really like reading at all.
