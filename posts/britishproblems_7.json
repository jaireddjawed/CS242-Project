I was confronted with the grim truth last night when I took the time to sort and count the odd items; three tea spoons, a soup spoon, two forks and a knife. I confronted her and she shrugged me off.\n\nNow I know from experience the pain and suffering a phantom workplace cutlery thief can cause. My work kitchen has fallen prey to a spoon thief in the past; we lost a pack of 12 tea spoons in a week leaving us no option but to modify a spoon so it could be tied to the counter top. \n\nThe worst part is she doesn't seem to care.

Wanted something from the chilled aisle, and when I spotted it, of course there is an old lady stood there reading every packet of ham she could find, and she was so engrossed, she didn't hear my \"excuse me please.\" \n\nThen after that, I wandered over to the fridge to get some fish. Along comes a woman who proceeds to put her basket handle up against the glass fridge door that I was obviously looking in, to fumble around in her bag to get her glasses out. Right, sod that, who needs fish anyway? Onto the next aisle where a man is pushing his trolley sideways so no one can get past. Ok, don't need anything up there. \n\nFreezer aisle next. 2 women talking and stood, again, with their trolleys blocking the aisle. Didn't give a monkeys that I was coming towards them, and just stayed there. I huffed and pushed my way past them, blood boiling at this point. \n\nAh, then the checkout. I'd been through the arduous journey that is dodging elderly folk in Lidl, nothing could rile me now, right? Well, you're wrong. I'm trying to throw everything from my full basket onto the treadmill, sorry, conveyor belt, and as I'm doing so, a man stands right next to me who just HAS to put his things on at the same time as me. Bear in mind, I'm at the end of the queue, there just isn't room, but he still has to do it anyway. He got an angry glare from me. That glare will haunt his dreams for days, I'm sure. \n\nI mean, what's wrong with people? Is it really that hard to just look around and be aware of your surroundings? People, please!",
