Who's more correct?\n\nTIA.",

To me, in the first example, both \"oh\" and \"okay\" are both serving as introductory words, thus warranting the comma after both words before the actual topic sentence is stated. \n\nAt the same time, however, the second example's structure makes perfect sense to me as well.

Sometimes it's called liberation, enlightenment, awake, whatever the word may be. We suspect there's really no vocabulary that captures **what that might be**.

Why does this rule not apply?\n\nDoes this rule always not apply to names? For example, when talking about two people called Larry, is is Larrys or Larries?
