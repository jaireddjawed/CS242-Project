        "text": "My Husband has ADHD and is a textbook pacer.\n\nThis never bothered me too much but we recently downsized and its becoming a problem. We also have a child recently turned 2. Essentially we are tripping over eachother.\n\nAlso his pacing has worsened. And for good reason. We have just migrated to the UK, where he has never been before and 2 weeks after his arrival my father passed away suddenly. He was there with me when it happened.\n\nWhile our family was sitting in grief, my husband was pacing up and down and up and down and quite frankly - was driving everyone crazy. My Mum sent him out on a random errand just to get him out of the house.\n\nI want to be respectful and understanding of his condition, but since all this habits happened, his pacing is seriously triggering my anxiety - which I have been diagnosed and treated for for decades. \n\nHe doesnt sit - he constantly hovers. Even when watching tv. He follows me everywhere (which was the case before my Dads passing) and now I am also in deep deep grief its contributing to pushing me over th edge of own mental health.\n\nI have tried to talk to him about it, but he gets defensive and upset, which tells me I am approaching it all wrong. So I have turned to this sub for help.\n\nWhat could someone do/say to you, not to make you stop overnight because that's not realistic - but get them to at least understand your point?",

Ever since I got diagnosed this sub has helped so much with learning but also helping me stop stigmatising my own disorder (people with parents who doesn't belive in ADHD you know what in talking about). \n\nAnyway. This sub has also helped me be more honest with people around me. So when I do something that's so obviously coming from ADHD, like interrupting my friend and changing the topic of the conversation 4 times under 5 minutes, I now have the courage to say \"I'm sorry, I am working on it and yada yada\". I am very proud of this. \n\nBut many of my friends have always given these small looks and comments like \"adhd is just coping for people that doesn't know how to clean\" etc. It makes me sad but I know that I used to think the same some years ago so I just try to educate them in a friendly way. \n\nHowever. Yesterday one of my closest friends started going on about how ADHD literally doesn't exist, and how the government just puts people in different disorders in order to drug them down. I had no words. He knows how much the diagnosis and this sub is helping me but still people close to me just see this whole thing as a scam. Other friends joined him and agreed.\n\nCan you guys help me? I really don't know what to do. I want to be honest with my friends but it feels like they have already decided that I have been fooled by \"society and government\". \n\nThank you. Also forgive me for my English it is my third language.",

I always thought I was lazy at house chores, bad at studying and paperwork, etc. I can now start a task immediately, focus on it and I feel calm or unworried a lot of the time. I felt bad about a lot of things before because I couldn’t make myself be more useful and I constantly had to ask for help but now I’m managing myself and helping others too. \n\nI googled the medication and found the brand name and found it was linked vaguely to adhd. \n\nMy question is, for people who have been unmedicated adults and are now medicated, is this what medication for adhd feels like? Can anyone else offer any experiences for how their life changed following being put on medication?",

My appetite is fine, my mood is fine, I don't get headaches, I don't get a \"crash\", my sleep is fine, everything is fine. Even when it wears off, I can focus (if the right conditions are met). For example, right now I am studying for an exam. I've been studying all day, so maybe I can still focus because that's what I've been doing for the past 6 hours. But it's 2 am, so my Adderall should definitely be worn off. This is probably related, but I always focus better late at night. Before I was medicated this was true too. Anyway, I just find it interesting how I am unable to relate to a lot of peoples' experience with Adderall. I wonder what it is about my body that causes this.",

I stopped taking 50mg of Seroquel for sleep last Monday and i have averaged 3-4 hrs max sleep each night since then, previously 5-6hrs (which wasn't enough). I've been learning about and planning my health and fitness goals. I've been working out for 3mths and have lost a lot of weight. In hindsight I think I've totally burnt myself out over the last week by hyperfocusing on this. I've spent at least 8-12 hrs sometimes more on this, nutrition, exercise, tracking, monitoring and creating an in-depth plan identifying risks to goal completion etc. Last night I tried to sleep listening to more new/novel information on the subject and even dreamed about it in the short amount of sleep that I had. I feel strange, totally drained, last night I was exhausted and collapsed into bed 2hrs earlier than normal but couldn't sleep for 4hrs. Now I've realised this I do not want to stop what I'm doing, I like a drug addict (I've been one) want to cling to this/hold onto it for dear life. I kind of feel like I'm coming down so to speak. I know some of the affects maybe attributed to Seroquel withdrawal although very minor but it feels more like an all consuming dopamine filled hyper focus for days on end frying myself to the bone. Also engaging in some high, cheap quick and easy dopemine hits as well which I stopped and only started when I hyperfocused. \n\nCan anyone relate to this?",

Curious about people's experience starting on medication and the various side-effects that they've had to deal with and how that has unfolded.\n\nI started taking dexamphetamine pills (typically 2.5mg twice a day with some breaks and variations etc..). The first 1.5 weeks were amazing , loved how much more focused and in-control I felt.\n\nThe last week I've been experiencing nausea, headaches, fatigue and brain fog. I'm getting mixed messages about if these sort of side-effects are part of adapting to the meds or if they are an indication that I should go off them.\n\nThird option is that it's being caused by something else completely but after a blood test there's no sign of anything obviously out of whack.  \n\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar or has some wisdom to add to the equation.  \n\n\nThanks heaps,\n\nLauren",

I’ve noticed something about myself and I am wondering if it’s an ADHD symptom.\n\nI am obsessed with efficiency, both at work and at home. Like, always trying to figure out the how to get things done faster, whether that be by making something repeatable, in a particular order, strategically placing things around the house, having a checklist, etc. People who do things slowly and ESPECIALLY who speak slowly, drive me insane. I am also a notorious planner. I have to think out the steps of everything; however, I deviate from my plans all of the time, buuut always deviating to another plan. There’s always a plan but it changes a lot, and everything has to be as efficient as possible! lol \n\nIs this an ADHD thing? I could see how maybe it’s also an OCD thing. Like, my trigger to ask this question tonight was because I realized I’ve been pumping my shampoo, etc. the same # of times each time, not because I have a compulsion but because of efficiency. I have learned that if I pump my shampoo 5 times, I get the perfect amount and don’t have to keep going back for more.",

        "author": "pireruu",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11qwe1r/adhd_or_asd/",
        "text": "Hello! I'm 22 and was diagnosed with ADHD around 6 months ago and am medicated for it. I do think I have ADHD, but after doing some research on ASD, I've started to wonder if I have both. But a lot of the symptoms are so similar that it's incredibly difficult to decipher which symptom belongs to which. Some things that I do/have done that made me start suspecting ASD:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am very averse to change. I drive the same way to work every time, even if it's not the fastest, because it's what I'm familiar with. I get very upset and uncomfortable if something causes me to deviate from that route, because now I don't know which lane I need to be in, or where the stop signs are. I always have Google Maps open, even when I know exactly how to get there, because I'm afraid I'll get lost even though I know the route. I remember one time when I was in middle school, my dad decided to surprise me with a new vanity in my room, and moved my bed to the other side of the room to make way for it. I got home and cried because I felt lost in my own room and was unfamiliar with the layout. I live with my boyfriend, and he will often leave a dish or two in the sink. It will sit there for a couple of days, and wash my own dish and put it away, and I could very easily clean his dishes as well, but I won't because I feel like it's become part of my routine to see that dish in the sink. It makes it very difficult because ADHD makes it very hard for me to do chores, but when I get the motivation to clean, I feel success and discomfort at the same time, because I've cleaned up a mess that was familiar to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I overanalyze everything. If I know I'm meeting someone new for the first time, I will daydream and think about every possible conversation I could have with them, up to weeks beforehand (this causes pretty bad insomnia). I will think of everything they could possibly say, and I come up with the ideal responses before I've even met them. So when everything doesn't go exactly the way I imagined beforehand, I get upset. If someone says or asks me something that I didn't expect at all, I will go back to my head and play out different scenarios, then respond with what I think is ideal. But from their perspective, I've gone non-verbal for ten uncomfortable seconds. Or if I'm in a group setting, the topic has already moved on by the time I've thought of a response. My mind is also incredibly overactive and my imagination is very vivid -- I will play out an entire hour long game of tetris marathon, while singing along to a song, with a movie on in the background, while I'm petting a cat -- all in my head, all at once, while I'm trying to sleep (it's a zoo up here). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- When I have leftovers, I will always ration it out in my head, and while I'm eating. I like to savor foods that I really like, so I will want to have as many chances to eat it as I possibly can. So when I open the fridge and see that it's gone, I get super upset. But it's frustrating because often times, I'll forget about it, and it will go bad after a few days. I believe this is also a symptom of ADHD? But I tend to obsess over different foods for a brief period of time. In middle school, I would come home and eat a PB&amp;J every day. I did this for like a month, then decided I didn't want them ever again. I've had this happen in my adult life with canned chicken noodle soup, garlic green beans, hot cheetos, pickles, etc. I eat them so often, that I get sick of it and rarely ever touch it again. I also tend to buy the same brand for everything, and get upset when my boyfriend brings home a different one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I also have a lot of tics (or stims? I'm not sure which it is). I scrunch my philtrum until I can get that familiar sensation of skin against my nose, I rub my thumbnail with my index finger until I feel every groove of the nail, I stretch my fingers out a lot, I touch the edge of my phone screen where it meets my case until I can feel between the ridge, and other random stuff that causes me discomfort until I feel satisfied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of this stuff lines up with both ADHD and ASD so I was hoping to get some insight, and tips on managing these symptoms. Thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this! :)",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,   \n\n\nI'm very new to the ADHD world, and although I have managed to catch up to speed with most things over the past several months, I still have things I am trying to iron out and was hoping y'all could give me some perspective, tips, and advice. I'll provide some stats and background info before I dive into my present concerns!  \n**Diagnosis:** \n\n* Inattentive Adult ADHD on September 2022\n* Binge Eating Disorder \n* Nil other mental or physical conditions \n\n**Physical Stats:**\n\n* 32-year-old male\n* Normal BMI, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, ECG, and Blood Profile\n\n**Pre-med Habits:**\n\n* Relatively active\n* Uncontrolled binge eating + usual other eating disorders... \n* I did not sleep and felt better for it.. averaged 2-3hrs/day and caught up on weekends\n* Self-induced sleep deprivation helped with mood, control of focus, attention, and significantly reduced procrastination despite the apparent mental slowing &amp; physical fatigue, so pulling 40-50 hours straight deprivation wasn't uncommon. Coincidentally, it also helped address the binge eating tendency too. \n\n**Prescribed Medication:**\n\n* Dexedrine - 5mg (previously)\n* Vyvanse - 70mg\n\n**History &amp; Response to Medication:**  \n**Started on Dexedrine:**\n\n* I was commenced on a trial of Dexedrine of 5mg, 3 times daily, spaced 4hrs apart. The initial response was nothing short of amazing.. A silence I've never known fell upon me, and it literally felt like I could see and hear things better. There was a stillness of mind that I had never felt before, and this gave me a sense of control that I never knew I was missing. \n* Unfortunately, the 5mg Dex started waning by the 3rd week in terms of duration, so the psychiatrist brought it up to 5mg x 4 times daily, spaced 3hrs apart. \n* This worked well again for about 1-2 weeks, but a strange, sleepy sensation occurred every time I took the 5mg medication. In contrast, it previously would do wonders for daytime wakefulness, focus, and productivity.\n* The sleepiness is not a sedative-like sensation. It was more like a feeling of being relaxed and sunbathing on the beach in the warm, soothing sun, kind of sleepy lol. \n* So the psychiatrist worked with me through this by increasing the Dexedrine dosage to 10mg twice daily spaced out by 4-5hrs. This completely overcame the sleepy effects and worked well, but naturally, the duration waned over time. \n\n**Commenced Vyvanse:**\n\n* I learnt about Vyvanse and how it could replace the multiple doses of Dexedrine, and so I was much more interested in this because I now needed to take Dexedrine every few hours. \n* So my psychiatrist switched me to 40mg Vyvanse + 5mg Dexedrine rescue dosage if needed (before this, I was on 10mg Dex morning &amp; afternoon, and 5mg dex rescue if needed) \n* However, the 40mg has the same sleepy sensation again, which was really tiring 45-60mins into the dose and gradually eases off by the 3rd hour, but by then.. I was mentally pooped from having to endure the first 3 hrs, and so it kind of compromised the rest of the day.\n* I navigated with my Psychiatrist again on this, and we decided to put the 5mg IR Dex in the morning with the Vyvanse 40mg, and voila, it overcame the 3hr sleepy ride, and the Vyvanse was beautifully sustaining my focus and control for about 6 hours before it fizzled out. \n* But the same thing has kept happening.. after 2 weeks or so, and despite the 5mg IR Dex + 40mg, the sleepy urge to go lay down was overpowering the increased attention &amp; focus.. and the Vyvanse was duration taper down to &lt;5 hours.\n* This was then again resolved by 10mg Dex + 40mg Vyvanse\n\n**My Ongoing Problem:**\n\n* I work long hours, which is often up to 11-12 hours, and so the problem is the medication duration is not long enough, and the consequence is the urge to go lay down and increasingly slower thought processing which affects my speech coherency e.g. stuttering, rambling etc etc\n* Previously without meds, I would just be in sleep-deprived mode, and this consistently gave me the focus and control I needed for work, and it is literally more stable than the prescribed medication, albeit unhealthy.\n* Mr psychiatrist has been bumping up the Vyvanse (now at 70mg + 5mg IR Dex) to try and extend the duration of benefits, and although it helps, the medication continues to have the strange \"go take a relaxing nap, buddy!\" sensation that is ironically distracting...\n\n**Question to the ADHD Community:**\n\n* Do any of you guys have this \"go take a nap, buddy\" sensation with Vyvanse? It's freaking hilarious but annoying at the same time because you can feel that the medication is partially helping with energy, focus, attention, and reduced procrastination, but this sensation is INCREASINGLY becoming distracting. \n* Dexedrine seems to be able to reduce this effect to some extent, but given that 70mg of Vyvanse is the upper limit for the medication, I've only limited myself to the 5mg IR in the mornings. \n* I am due to meet with my Psychiatrist in a few weeks, but I don't know how to convey the above without sounding like I am drug-seeking patient, because.. what do I know?!\n* Also, I'm sure I am putting him in a bind because Australia has some kinda restrictions in prescribing above certain amounts, and that takes into consideration all classes of stimulants. \n\n**PS:** I am not seeking medical advice, just reassurance that some of y'all might have had similar experiences, and thus hoping to see how you guys went about it!",

(15m) for context. It's not like I don't do useful things in my time I just can't make myself focus at all on schoolwork or anything I don't see an important and immediate need to get done. I have a few business I make more than enough money off of but my parents are unable to see any path for me other than staying in all double advanced classes and getting some complex collage degree I know I never can. I'm not wanting to drop out of school or anything just trying to find a way to convince my parents to let me get some help and maybe let me switch into slightly easier classes for next year.

        "text": "Has anyone had a direct report who had difficulty connecting the dots and doing analysis work that requires asking and anticipating the right questions? I’m wondering if this has something to do with working memory issues. From personal experience I’ve recently been having issues with this myself ever since I started Adderall (after it wears off) - however I’m aware that I don’t remember something. For me it’s always like I remember I had a conversation about topic X but I didn’t take notes and now a certain detail is missing from my memory. For her it’s as if the entire discussion didn’t happen at all. So if someone doesn’t remember something long enough then they can’t make a connection to it later I would think.\n\nAnyway, does anyone know if this is a trainable skill? How would you coach someone to improve critical thinking and analysis if there’s a memory issue? \n\nI know she takes lorezepam for anxiety or something so I wonder if it’s related to this - but I don’t want to get in any kind of HR trouble by raising this question at work.\n\nI have ADD - but I’m not sure if she does. Unlike myself she is organized and actually gets shit done without overthinking… but sometimes as an analyst that “overthinking” is needed on the job.\n\nTIA",

I noticed that mostly all I get is a run through the wash and my car dried off. I always get the basic and give a generous tip for what was done AFTER.\n\nI got this idea one day that I give that same tip BEFORE the car wash and the guy cleaned my car up all nice. Scrubbed the wheels, hand polished wax coating, stuff they don't even offer as part of the wash.\n\nI tip anywhere from $5-$15 depending on how much I can afford and always do it before the wash.\n\nWhen I go there now, they charge me for the $6.99 wash but give me the $16.99 wash instead. The guy knows me by name and also knows both of my vehicles. I normally wash my car and my wife's and I'm a regular.\n\nMy wife took her car there one day and gave him the tip before the wash like I do. He said \"I'll take care of your Tiguan. Tell ______ I said hello.\" My wife was confused but I told her the black Tiguan with tinted windows, black rims with low profile tires and a light brown leather interior was pretty unique and the possibility of him washing a car with those same things would be close to impossible. Yeah, there are other cars he could mistake as the same one but it is unique and he washes cars all day. He notes the little things.\n\nI was broke the other day but needed a good wash because my father in law was going to be in town and technically he owns the car I drive and I wanted it to look nice. I explained as much to him and said I would tip him when I got paid the next day.\n\nHe said \"You and your wife always tip me well with your Corolla and her Tiguan. Please don't come back and tip me tomorrow. You have helped me out enough, today I am helping you.\"\n\nBecause of over thinking I often feel like I am not noticed. Not only did he know me, he knew both of the cars I got washed there and also recognized my wife's car as the one I bring in even though it was the first time he had ever seen her.\n\nThroughout the past year, he has upgraded my carwash and taken extra steps that are not required of him in his job. It feels like I am over paying but I end up with a really great wash and he gets a good tip in cash. We both win and we have reached an equilibrium at this point. $5 or $15, he doesn't care because I will tip him the best I can.\n\nI tend to think that I am a ghost and outside my small circle of friends and family, people don't care about me.\n\nThat is not true. People do care about us even if we are sure that they don't. I love to hide behind my awareness and apathy but those are really just ways of feeling ok about how much I love to hate myself.\n\nTurns out people actually do care. Me convincing myself that people outside of who I let in is difficult to believe. This is only a single example of why it is true. Trusting people is the difficult part.",

To me, it feels as if I ran a whole marathon, but in reality I've been sitting on the couch for five minutes. This also makes it extremely hard to get work or pretty much anything done.\n\nAnother one is how anxiety is often caused by ADHD. For example: You can't get anything done because you feel tired all the time, but this leads to you not finishing school work. After that, everytime you're assigned school work, you get extremely anxious, as you feel you won't finish it. At that point, not only are you tired, you're anxious as well.

For the first week or so, I felt this mental calm (none of the constant thoughts I typically have), overall physical relaxation, and increased focus/initiation. The biggest thing for me was the reduced anxiety. I don’t know if this was just my body being new to stimulants, which is likely.\n\nFast forward to Week 2 and I wasn’t feeling those same effects — instead, I started feeling irritable and more anxious. I read somewhere about the importance of protein and food intake, so I’ve been monitoring this although I don’t think anything really changed in those short few weeks. I also started limiting my coffee/caffeine intake which I didn’t think would be an issue since I was drinking my daily 1 macchiato when I first started the meds.\n\nI told my doctor about this experience and he switched me to 20 mg. I’m not currently feeling any differences as far as the mental “chillness” and focus, so I’m kinda frustrated. And at a loss.\n\nIn y’all’s experiences, is there something I’m doing wrong? Are these effects indicative of too high or low of a dose? Is there something that I’m just doing wrong lol? TIA! 😊",

My psych was hesitant to put me on meds due to my other conditions of anxiety, dissociation and derealisation (DPDR) as well as OCD. He thought that the presence of these other symptoms might mean it wasn’t ADHD, as if they are all mutually exclusive. But he said I fit the profile of ADHD so we would give meds a try (and I’m so grateful). Well, turns out since I started vyvanse both my adhd and other anxiety symptoms including the dissociation and DPDR have greatly reduced. Even my OCD is better, as I feel so regulated I’m in much better control over my compulsions. Is it really that outlandish to consider that the imbalance that causes/contributes to ADHD also causes other things? Like, I’m talking my anxiety goes away as soon as the pill kicks in and its been 2 months. \n\nMy anxiety is very much a neurosis of thinking too much and my nervous system clocking out constantly, causing me to dissociate. I wish doctors would consider that not all these things are mutually exclusive, and it scares me that more uptight doctor may have refused meds due to these other conditions (mine is super chill and casual thankfully).",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I am a 21M and I am a currently on the track to graduate from university, and I will spend another year in graduate school (I'm a cybersecurity major) and probably either decide if I will stay with my family or move out. I also live in a very robust city, so once I do know how to create music the opportunities to perform are quite amble, but I'll get to that later.\n\nThe problem of course, is that I am just starting out, I have a good voice and I would consider myself quite energetic as a person. Yet, I also sustain myself and my job is that I own an online record store. Not only that, I am quite obsessed with just going on my page and scrolling, while also doing nothing really important for hours at a time. On top of that, I don't have social media, and I don't have any crazy familial commitments, so I have so much potential to really focus my dreams and get to work.\n\nHowever, I am so obsessed with vinyl, and online shopping/selling I spend so much time just doing impulsive and repetitive actions that I am quite disgusted from how I am behaving. I do work a bit, but it is nothing I need to spend more than 30 minutes - 1 1/2 hours doing a day. After that I can spend hours and really break out of my mojo to just randomly check my website, amazon, and eBay pages expecting activity. Whether or not it comes doesn't matter as I just do the same impulsive shit and do it again. I also repetitively check my emails and messages, and it's just a weird cycle that happens so many times that it really disrupts my train of focus.\n\nThe climax of the problem is, I use the remaining 5-6 hours of free time I have in the day (not including eating, chores, and walking), basically just mindlessly scrolling. If I used half of that time daily to really get in on learning music production, I can definitely at least create enough within a year or even the summer to establish myself as an artist, and I really do believe that (else my dreams would feel dead to me).\n\nI rely a bit on my best friend/neighbor who is quite good at music production himself, yet I want to be more reliant on me, as I am still trying to figure out my sound and what my brand will look like. I want to be more efficient, and I don't know how busy I will be after the summer when I may potentially have school projects to work on. The impeding understanding that once I learn music production, that there will be a branch of more things to work on within that field, and then to worry about other things involving my music social media and creativity really edges me. Because of this I guess I get lots of thoughts and worries that I won't be able to achieve my goals, and that the pressure is just going to be a lot.\n\nThis is all, and I don't know how else to conclude other than to ask for any advice or help! I really would appreciate it!",

I want her to understand me enough to take me serious but I don't want to talk a bunch, but if i don't tell her everything I feel like she'd think I haven't done research and am doing this on a whim because i'm bored or something. I don't want to be over-prepared or under-prepared.\n\nAnother thing, I'm not in education at the minute, but will be starting two online courses in a few days. I knew someone who had inattentive ADHD and autism, I asked her the process of the assessment and as I thought the guidance teacher and parent got one. My mum doesn't even know i'm doing this and I can't see her telling the absolute truth on the paper.  I love her but she's the type of person to say; \"Well, she didn't daydream today so it's not often\", she doesn't actually think deeply about it.. the complaints from the school reports, the socialization problems, bad inattentive span, etc.. and because i'm not in high school anymore then will they give it to my school? I left nearly two months ago but they can't give it to the college, I don't know them enough and they don't know me enough.\n\nAny advice?",

        "text": "TL;DR Methylphenidate XR gives me a clear and productive mind, but makes me feel emotionally flat and depressed, which is not how I feel unmedicated.\n\nHi everyone, it's been one week since I started methylphenidate XR (10 mg) for my ADHD-PI and I have very mixed feelings. \n\nOn one hand, it makes feel very clear-headed and productive. I have a much easier time getting up and doing things like cleaning and writing cover letters for jobs, which before I had a lot of trouble doing. It also makes it feel like social interactions are no issue, as I no longer struggle paying attention in conversations, and no longer struggle to find words.\n\nOn the other hand, it makes me feel emotionally flat, to the point where it makes me anxious and I feel very depressed. Everything feels much less enjoyable and grey, especially things that I adored before like music, which now just sounds like annoying noise that I want to turn off. This is especially irritating because one of my main goals going on medication was being able to actually sit down and focus on creative hobbies (like music production). I was definitely not depressed before I went on my medication, and had a love for life in general, despite my frustration with my ADHD symptoms. Today I broke down crying to my SO because of how awful I felt emotionally. I find myself looking forward to when the medication starts to wear off at the end of the day so I can feel more like myself. \n\nI am at the point where it feels so awful that I want to stop and ask to try something else at my next appointment, which is a little over a week away. I'm thinking of maybe asking to try Vyvanse instead. However, I tried Adderall XR a few years ago and also felt bad taking it (anxious and wired feeling), making me think the stimulant class of drugs may not agree with me. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Did you stop taking it, or did the depression lessen after taking it for an amount of time? Did switching medications make a difference?\n\nThanks!",
