        "text": "Hey guys, I am a mechanical engineer (graduated in 2015) from a pretty well known school, University of Washington. I worked in aerospace for a while and currently in automotive and I am extremely unsatisfied and slowly dying from the inside from not following my life long passion of coding either software or game dev.\n\nI started as a CS student and LOVED my fundamental of CS and java classes! Unfortunately switched my major to ME and went with it which is the biggest regret of my life that I feel it every morning I wake up.  I'm at a point (age 28) that its really getting in to me and really want to learn to code, build a portfolio and switch careers even if it comes with a paycut to become a junior software dev.\n\nI've been researching a LOT about coding boot camps and attended to a couple orientations, seems like they are mostly heavily web dev focused and also not all are very cheap! I am thinking of starting Coding Dojo, what are your thoughts on that?\n(FYI I signed up for cs50 already and I am loving it!) \n\ntldr; Dear fellow redditors please give me your best advises for my situation, either its a book or series of them, lectures online or taking a bootcamp? getting a second bachelor degree or finding an online masters degree?",

        "text": "I think it is. \n\n1. Because RESTful has intermediaries and they are literally independent \"components\" between a client and the server. We can add/replace an intermediary between the client and the server like we can with a component in CBD.\n\n2. Since reusable caches are used RESTful approach, this fits the concept of component (CBD) which is reusability\n\n3. Also, the server doesn't have to know what the heck is going on with intermediaries. It does not care about what happened to a request message with intermediaries. This highlights the encapsulation which is very important in CBD;  the client does not need to know about the inner workings of the component (implementation) in order to make use of it.\n\n\nWhat do you think?\nAre you with me or against me?",

Essentially the requirements are:\n\n- Be able to pull whatever data from the database\n- Generate formatted report from that data by populating a template (HTML, docx)\n- Export to Word and/or PDF\n\nSo initially I made an API endpoint per report (this is a web app), and had PDFs generated and formatted correctly. But now I need to get the data into .docx/Word format, and I’m trying to figure out how I can design something as D.R.Y. as possible so that I don’t have to put in a TON of work every time the company decides they need another report (they’ve done this two, three times which is how I became aware that I had coded myself into a corner). Every report I’ve done thus far has been done via a “brute-force” method: code the queries needed for the report, format the data, and then render to PDF (using HTML to PDF via phantomjs). \n\nThe complexity occurred when the company came back and said “Hey, we need all of those reports in Word format, also we have 3 other new reports that we need and a report that is a slight variation on the old one but +/- 2 fields”. \n\nI am just having trouble coming up with a solid design/abstraction here, one that doesn’t send me down a week long hacking spree every time a requirement changes.",

I have the following list:\n\n* User Manual\n* Mobile App\n* Standalone Application\n* Website\n* Web Application\n* API\n* Other\n\nThe deliverables are meant to be generic and simple, and I have small blurbs associated with each, and each are going to have specific questions to elaborate on and help establish requirements.",

        "text": "I am planning to switch my major to CS but not sure yet :(\nPros\n\n**Good pay.** Using technology. Forces you to develop social skills to communicate with many different people. Very small minority of companies will let you work from home.\n\n**Cons**\n\n- Stressful – If things go wrong with something you’re responsible for, it’s on your head. You’ll work around the clock to fix it with people breathing down your back until it’s fixed. This depends upon the type of company and criticality of the process that’s broken.\n\n- No life – The trade off for being paid well is that you have to work whenever needed, typically providing 24/7 coverage. So you have to be on-call, like a doctor, work some weekends and you frequently feel like you’re giving your life to this corporation, who thinks they own you because they pay you a salary. There is no concept of 9-5 (there is, but it’s not the norm).\n\n- Doesn’t matter – When you’re not affecting the bottom line of a company, it feels like what you’re doing doesn’t really matter. In fact, even if you do affect the bottom line, you probably grow to feel the company itself doesn’t matter, unless they are saving baby seals or something. But that’s not the majority of the jobs out there. Typically, you’re working for large corporations and financial firms who operate with process and bureaucracy and don’t care about your needs, health, happiness, etc.\n\n- Being fake – Wearing a button-down shirt every day (feels like a costume), being afraid to say the wrong thing to the wrong person, trying to force yourself to be talkative and authoritative. Not finishing things – Sometimes you get really poor managers who ask you to switch from thing to thing. You, being a people-pleaser say yes to all of these things. The manager then asks you about the first thing he asked you and you have to say “uhhhh, I don’t know, I stopped to do the other 7 things.” This has an effect on your self-esteem. It’s bad news. You must learn to manage your tasks and tell your manager that you’re going to stop one thing for the next thing.\n\n- Very competitive – You have to sell yourself to get the best jobs. Actually, this is probably a pro, because you SHOULD learn to sell yourself. It’s the only way you can get anywhere in the world outside of your head.\nhttps://www.invincibleinfp.com/list-of-infp-careers/computer-sciencesoftware-designprogrammingsystems-analyst/",

Spring 2016 I ended up dropping out/getting kicked out towards the end of my junior year because I was doing a terrible job managing school and finances and stress after getting disowned by my family (I wasn't religious enough).\nWith my grades, UC Berkeley Computer Science won't let me into the major. I don't even know what I might have to major in. I don't even know how likely it is I'll get accepted back in, I can't make an advising appointment since I'm not as high priority as the currently enrolled students and I can't afford to live on campus. \n\nSo I took out an emergency student loan to pay rent, worked a shitty startup job as their first engineer, then worked at a series B startup as an intern, and am now in series C startup as an intern and I have recruiters reaching out to me now. \nI'm interning, taking open online courses, reading so much to keep up and I've learned so fucking much.\n\nCan people here who are almost all smarter, wiser, older, and more experienced than me please tell me why I should still care about graduating? \nI feel like I'm doing this ONLY to say \"I graduated\" but the past few years have been hell, why should I even bother?

        "text": "I'm working in a Japanese company as web engineer. We usually use PHP and Laravel. Now I'm learning Python and machine learning. And I have public GitHub repository.\nI have doubts about the company's policy. I would like you to tell me how your company is.\n\nLong hours work is obvious, and physical condition management is difficult. I usually work from 10: 00-10: 30 and leave at 23:30. There is no overtime payment due to discretionary labor.\n\nIn the past week, I had to stay in the company two nights and I went home early in the morning. That was twice.\n\nI offered to retire last month, but I was refused because CEO can not accept it.\n\nBecause of mental fatigue, I am suffering because I can not think what to do.\n\nTell me how it is in your country company.\nThanks.",

The overall GUI is already created, my job is specifically just coding the heat map of the network. I have to design the idea, figure out it's problems, and then code it from the ground up all the way to completion.\n\nDoes this sound like too much work to be having placed on me when I'm only a Software Engineer with 6 months working at this company being paid 60K? I feel like this is more the type of work for a Software Engineer III or even a senior software engineer. Am I horribly wrong? Or am I being asked to do work way above my pay grade and head?\n\nThis type of job is the hardest the company has thrown at me, with previous to-do things on the GUI being easier.",
