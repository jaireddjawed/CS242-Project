        "text": "I don’t know who to turn to, so I made this account so I could post here. I sent emails, dropped off notices at an apartment I help manage because rent wasn’t paid. Finally went there because no response. Found tenant’s body slumped in a chair. Smelled really bad. Called the police, but while I was waiting for them to arrive I noticed a notebook. Took a few pics of the pages. When I read it later, it freaked me the fuck out. Police won’t answer my questions about how she died. I think the answer is in the pages. Please help. Am I just freaking myself out or is there something to her ramblings? Thanks—R \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n12/5/22 \n\n~~Account of the Door~~\n\n~~Where is Susan?~~\n\nWhy am I trying to title this? Who am I even writing this for? Whoever finds it, I guess… depending on what happens next. Well ok. I better start at the beginning.\n\nI sometimes have memory problems. I’m not old—only ~~thirty-six~~ thirty-seven (LOL case in point!)—but still, there’s a world of difference between your thirties and your twenties. At twenty, I could pull all nighters and be up for partying the next day. At thirty, throwing my back out for the first time was the wake-up call that my body isn’t what it used to be. And forgetting my keys, locked inside my car, was the wake-up call that my mind could use the occasional reminder, too.\n\nThat’s what started the habit. My habit of leaving myself notes. Little things, like how to change a particularly complicated light in the ceiling, one of the fancy ones with a colored glass casing around it that has to be removed before you can reach the bulb. I went up there yesterday after the light went out to take off the casing, and just inside, written in black sharpie on a part of the glass no one can see except from a ladder, were instructions. My own handwriting, telling me how to remove the casing and what kind of bulb I’d need.\n\nI have no memory of writing these instructions. But I thanked my past self (4/22/18) for the foresight.\n\nSusan ~~laughs~~ laughed about this habit of mine. Last week I was looking everywhere for the key to my desk drawer, and I caught her in the mirror rolling her eyes as she told me to look on the drawer underside. Sure enough, scribbled on the underside in sharpie it said *8/6/22 check Pootie*. Pootie is an old stuffed toy, and I always date my notes so I know how long ago I wrote them. The key was tucked inside Pootie’s zippered back. \n\n“Well I’ll be!” I muttered as I slid open the desk drawer.\n\n“I remember you commenting on where to put the key, and you said, ‘I’ll put it in Pootie so I don’t forget.’ And since you *always* forget I insisted you write on the drawer.”\n\n“Oh, yeah…” It was pretty embarrassing how right Susan was about my memory. \n\n“… did you forget why you needed to open the drawer?”\n\n“No,” I lied to myself as I half-heartedly shuffled through the jumbled papers as if I were looking for something specific. I jammed the drawer closed and carefully returned the key to Pootie’s zippered back.\n\nI promise all this is going somewhere. The point is… normally I don’t think my forgetfulness is that big a deal, but when I went back to that drawer later on, thinking that if I organized it I’d remember what I’d been looking for, I found a note I didn’t remember writing.\n\n“Well, gee,” you’re probably thinking, “I’ve already said I don’t remember writing most of my little notes.” Okay, fair enough. But when one of my notes says, *Hey you, future me, if you can’t find what you’re looking for, check Pootie*—with that, there’s context and a clear purpose to why and when I wrote it. Millions of people everyday spend time looking for their misplaced keys or their favorite coffee cup. We put stuff where we’re sure to remember it and then instantly forget. Welcome to being human.\n\nBut no, this note was different. No context to it. It came fluttering out of my desk drawer on hot pink sticky paper: \n\n*11/13/22 Call maintenance about that door.*\n\nThe note was folded in half. I unfolded it, and just underneath the fold and underlined twice:\n\n*11/15/22 NO RECORD OF DOOR*\n\nNo record of door? What door? Which door did I have to call maintenance about that they had no records of? I asked Susan, but she just shrugged and said, “Could be any door. It’s an old building. Stuff needs fixing all the time.”\n\nFair enough. But the note was dated only two weeks prior. Even for me, that was an unusual amount of forgetfulness. And what did I mean by, “no record”? Later that same day, when I put on my comfy cardigan, I found another note crumpled up in the pocket along with chapstick and quarters for the laundry. I pulled out the rumpled note and read:\n\n*11/16/22*\n\n*11/18/22*\n\n*11/21/22*\n\nAnd on the back, boldly underlined:\n\n***KNOCKING.***\n\nIt was the knocking that got me *really* curious.\n\nSo I went around checking all the doors. Bedroom, bathroom, closets, the creaky old door out to the little balcony overlooking the street. When I didn’t find anything, I went in the hallway past dozens of neighbors’ doors, all with the numbers in embossed gold flaking away above old keyholes. It’s a building that has what I call “character” and my family calls “please move out.” A je ne sais quoi of rattling radiators, stained carpeting, and mice scrabbling in the walls. I once read a NYT article about how after an old woman passed away, her son went to her apartment and found a decomposing body hidden in her freezer. She’d kept it there for more than ten years. Honestly, this is *just* the kind of building that could happen in. Just recently there was an old man on floor four who got sick, and no one came in to look on him for weeks, while his body was decomposing just a couple of floors over our heads… \n\nAnyway! Finding no mysterious knocking, I returned to my unit on the second floor. And then it struck me. What does absent-minded old me do to manage my own forgetfulness? I *write stuff down.* Duh! I went straight to my desk to check the first place I should’ve looked. My journal. I flipped back to November the week before Thanksgiving.\n\nI found it. *I found the door*.\n\nI stared at inked sketch lines of concrete brick behind a vague outlined rectangle. On the bottom right corner was a scrawl like a scratched in face—a face? A yawning face. A screaming face. I don’t know. I was still trying to discern whether it was really a face or just an accidental scribble when the journal was snatched out of my hands. Susan ripped the drawing out, shrieking at me, “CAN’T YOU JUST LEAVE IT? YOU LEFT TO *FORGET* ALL THIS, REMEMBER? JUST *FORGET* ABOUT THE DAMNED DOOR!” She tore at the page savagely, frantically, ripping in a frenzy until there was nothing left but tiny rumpled bits.\n\nI sat there with my mouth hanging open, heart hammering, sunken into my chair as if I could disappear into it, listening to my heart skip against my ribs like a frightened bird in a cage. “What the fuck?” I whispered finally, reaching down to retrieve the notebook when she was gone. “What the fuck?”\n\n\\*\n\nSorry for the profanity. I don’t usually swear, but I was worked up and want to record everything accurately. Anyway, after that outburst, I finally remembered what happened before the holiday.\n\nSee, Susan’s blow up was probably about maintenance. It was already hard enough to get them out to the building, nevermind the added barrier of what they considered my “prank” calls. Only, my calls to them were never a prank. I called a few times right before Thanksgiving to report strange sounds behind this door in the basement. I might have called twice… three times? The memory is all a little hazy, because right before the holiday was so busy and stressful. My last call to building maintenance before I left for the holiday went something like this:\n\n**Maintenance**: You found a door in the basement, and someone was knocking?\n\n**Me**: That’s right, knocking.\n\n**Maintenance**: It was probably just pipes.\n\n**Me**: No! No, it definitely wasn’t pipes. It was knocking. Like someone wanting me to open the door. And, this is going to sound crazy but… I thought I heard a person in there. It sounded like… like someone was crying.\n\n**Maintenance**: Ok sure—\n\n**Me**: No no no don’t hang up!\n\nThey stopped taking my calls after that, and I considered going down and opening the door myself with some sort of tool, but Susan told me, “DON’T. What if you got it open only to get stuck inside?”\n\nThen she told me that if I was really convinced a human being was inside, instead of bugging maintenance, I should call the police. She was really stressed that with all my calls, the next time we had a *real* emergency, maintenance wouldn’t come out. It was a big deal for her. See, it was because maintenance had been unable to come out right away that *she* was the one who’d gone up to floor four to check on the old man a few weeks ago, and… well, it sort of traumatized me. Anyway, she was upset at the idea maintenance might essentially blacklist my unit, so she basically gave an ultimatum: either call the police, or forget the door stuff. I was about to leave for Thanksgiving with my family, so I could just use the trip as an opportunity to drop the matter.\n\nI considered. In all honesty, I had very little evidence there might be an actual person stuck behind this door. What would I show the police? My sketch of a basement door with a scary face that *I* drew? Then tell them I thought I heard noises down there? They’d chuckle condescendingly, and say something like, “Not to worry Miss Marple, I’m sure whatever sounds you heard were just old pipes.” And because I have no backbone, I’d just blush and awkwardly agree, and then we’d all be embarrassed for me. \n\nLong story short I promised I’d drop the whole thing.\n\nAnd to be honest, being away from this creaky old building over the holiday, I really did forget completely about the door stuff… until I found the sketch. It was the sketch that brought it all back. Weird though, isn’t it? How thoroughly I forgot it in such a short time? \n\nI remember perfectly now. I remember sitting in front of the door with my pen and scribbling the outline and the brick. But while I was away, it was almost like… somehow… leaving had smudged my memory. Almost like a half-forgotten ~~dream~~ nightmare. \n\nAnyway, after Susan’s dramatic outburst, I was more curious than ever. I had to see this door.\n\nSo I did the only thing I could do in order to know for sure.\n\nI went down to the basement.\n\n\\*\n\nIt sits tucked away in a corner at the end of a hallway: a narrow metal rectangle with rusty patches, the steely gray blending right in with the gray concrete of the walls. If I hadn’t been specifically searching for it I might never have seen it, that’s how unobtrusive it was. And in the bottom corner, even more fuzzy and abstract than my drawing, were scratches and dents along the metal that, if you are an imaginative person, you could see as a screaming face… \n\nGiven the dust on it and the walls and how it was almost invisible, I guessed it was an old storage closet. \n\nAfter a few minutes of exploring, but finding no way to open it, I knocked on the door. It was almost like knocking on solid brick. Nothing. Not even an echo. \n\n*Tap.*\n\nRight then, just as I was turning back to head up the stairwell, the soft sound of that *tap* stopped me. I looked back, frowning. “Hello?” I called.\n\nSilence.\n\nMust’ve been my imagination.\n\nI was about to walk away when I swear I heard a faint moan behind me, so soft I might have imagined it. And then the unmistakable sound of weeping, and though the sound was muffled by the door, I distinctly heard it say, “If you open the door, you invite it in.”\n\nCreepiest fucking thing—\n\nIt spoke in Susan’s voice.\n\n\\*\n\n12/6/22\n\nI haven’t moved from this chair. I keep hoping for Susan. She’s still missing. I keep hoping, if I just go about my business acting like everything is normal… if I go in to work and put on a smile and go through the motions like everything’s okay, maybe somehow it will be. Everything will go back to normal. ~~Susan will come back.~~\n\nStop, stop… okay, I’m going to pick up where I left off. This won’t make sense to whoever’s reading unless I tell it in order. \n\nSo. \n\nI was down in the basement. \n\nI heard what I thought sounded like Susan, but it couldn’t have been her—*couldn’t* have been. I know because I was looking at the clock and it was after work started when I went down checking on the door. But I knew her voice. I wasn’t sure how she could be in two places at once. I had chills all up my arms and along my spine as I bolted the three flights back up to my unit, slammed the door, threw myself into my chair and slouched there, waiting all evening.\n\nSusan never came back from work.\n\nThe next day—was it, Thursday? Friday? I called in to work and asked after her. They told me she hadn’t been to work in weeks, not since before the holiday…. So this morning I called maintenance again. And before they could hang up on me, I told them that it was a *real* issue this time—that I’d found a pipe had burst. That there was water leaking all over the floor. \n\n“From where?” the maintenance guy asked.\n\nResisting the urge to say, “from the door with the face,” I described the general area in the basement and said I’d show him when he arrived. In fact, there really *was* water puddling around the basement floor, albeit because I spilled it there myself earlier. And after this, there *will* be a record of the door in the maintenance office! Hah!\n\nSo… anyway, I met the maintenance guy—some new guy named Ryan, not our usual cranky one. And I led him to where the puddle I’d spilled was, and he was like, “What door?” And like, the door was *right there,* he was looking *right at it,* and I traced my finger along the outline and he kind of did this little blinking thing and a shake and laugh and said, “Oh, that door.” Then he scrunched his face and said, “Didn’t even know it was here.” Then he mopped up the water and waited a few minutes, and he said, “I think must have just been a spill. I’m not seeing any more water seeping out.”\n\n“Wait—you’re not going to open it to make sure—” I almost said, “to make sure that no one’s trapped in there,” but caught myself and said instead, “—to make sure there’s not still something leaking?”\n\nHe told me that he was just an assistant manager filling in, and that “Manny, who usually works this building” was out until Thursday, and that Manny knows the ins and outs of this old place better than he did. He said he’d call a plumber if it was an actual emergency, and to let him know if I noticed more water, but for now he’d make a note of it—\n\n*BOOM BOOM BOOM*\n\nThe sudden banging made me jump. And he looked down at me funny and said, “Oh, it’s just the pipes.” And when I asked if pipes are usually that loud, he shrugged and said, “Sometimes.” Made me wonder if we’d heard the same thing. I asked, “Do pipes ever moan? Like… almost like… crying?” He laughed, but it was obvious he was starting to suspect I was either a little off my rocker or pranking him. Especially after I knocked on the door and said, “Yoohoo, anybody in there? Susan? You playing a trick on us in there?” My knuckles felt as if they’d rapped against solid concrete. There wasn’t even an echo. The management guy gave this kind of awkward chuckle and said, “You definitely shouldn’t be hearing any voices coming from there… except maybe if you’ve eaten some funny mushrooms.” He grinned at his own joke. As we headed back upstairs, he told me to call if I noticed another leak in that same spot “by the wall.” \n\n\\*\n\n12/8/22\n\nTime seems like it’s just… slipping past… No one but me has noticed Susan’s disappearance. No one has made the least bit of fuss about it. Her work called a couple of times last week, but they’ve obviously assumed she just quit. I tried calling them today again to ask about her, and they told me to stop making prank calls and hung up on me.\n\nThrowing out some old, wilted spinach made me think about the old man...\n\nI don’t know how the spinach got so old so fast. I swear I bought it just yesterday, or… maybe the day before. I don’t know. But it was slimy and had that rotting vegetable smell as if it was in the fridge forever. I should talk to Susan about doing some shopping.\n\nReally, I think maybe I scared her, talking about the door. Obsessing over the knocking. It might have reminded her of what happened a couple of months ago with the old man on floor four.\n\nIt was Susan who found him.\n\nThe old guy… I’d seen him once or twice on the stairs. Our building is from long before the ADA, no elevator, and I remember Susan worrying about him having to climb up and down so many flights all the time. She offered to help him with his groceries and things like that so he didn’t have to make the trip up and down so much. I don’t remember his name… Gary? Gregory?\n\nAnyway, so this old man hadn’t been seen for a while. And I guess Susan worried whether he was doing all right or not. She went up to visit him and decided to go get him some groceries because his fridge was empty and he was looking really thin, like he hadn’t eaten properly in a while. He smelled bad and he was acting… “dissociative,” I think was the word she used. He kept saying strange things, was obviously pretty muddled. He kept asking her “Where’s Gregory?” and she’d tell him, “You’re here, you’re right here.” And he’d just wring his hands and ask her where Gregory had gone. \n\nCreepy, right? *I* sure thought so. But Susan worried because he was so thin—she thought he hadn’t been eating. She asked him if he needed help with groceries, and he said he hadn’t had much appetite “since Gregory left.” So Susan got him a week’s worth of groceries, made supper for him, and asked him for numbers of relatives or friends. Turned out he had none, so she called social services to come check on him, and then after that things were more or less normal.\n\nThat is… I *assumed* they were normal. Susan wanted to check in on him a few times, but I kept telling her to leave it alone, he was probably fine. To be honest, I was a little creeped out by the whole situation. I thought it was better to leave things to social services. But a few weeks later… two? Three? I don’t remember. Anyway, Susan was tired of me saying to leave things be.\n\n“Just gonna check on him,” she said.\n\nShe went to his door. And what happened next was really strange. \n\nShe heard knocking. She heard knocking from his door, and heard him whisper: “If you open the door, you invite it in.”\n\n“Gregory?” she called.\n\nIt sounded like he was crying. \n\nSobbing, just on the other side of the door. \n\nShe knocked. The crying continued, but the door did not open. She assumed he must be dissociating again, and she knocked and said, “Gregory, let me in!” and no one answered, but the door opened slightly—that was when she realized it wasn’t locked. \n\n“Gregory?” She pushed the door open.\n\nThe smell almost knocked her out. She later described it in her notes as—putrid. Rotting meat. Piss and shit and this fetid, horrible, sour smell like old unwashed skin and… like meat you’d left in a container and forgotten about. \n\nIt was the stench that made her realize something was horribly wrong. She called police, and waited outside the door for them to arrive. But before they got there, she held her breath and poked her head in, just once. And she saw, there in the living room seated on a chair, a perfectly still figure slumped and motionless. She couldn’t see anything of his eyes. His head was tilted back over the chair. Somehow she knew his mouth was open and his eyes were glassy, and that he was dead—had been dead for days. That he’d died there in his living room sitting in that chair. Remnants of the supper she’d made for him two weeks earlier were still on the table. Police said he had starved to death, even while leaving the fresh groceries to rot on his counter. She kept thinking, if she’d checked on him sooner…\n\nAnyway. \n\nSo now, this door stuff, knocking, and Susan’s voice. It has me terrified. Where has Susan gone? But whenever I try to tell anyone about it, they get annoyed and act like I’m pranking them. I don’t know what to do…. \n\n\\*\n\n12/9/22\n\nI can see the outline of the door so clearly now. I’m not sure how I ever thought it hard to see before. It’s never silent anymore, either. Last time I was down there, I heard Susan—and another voice. A quavering old man’s voice. Both of them crying softly. As soon as I got near and whispered, “Susan?” a horrible racket started up. They were banging loudly, begging me to open the door. Screaming.\n\nI saw something else I’d missed, too. \n\nThe door has a handle now.\n\n“LET US OUT LET US OUT PLEASE OPEN IT PLEASE!”\n\nI fled.\n\n\\*\n\n12/10/22\n\nI called maintenance and got the actual maintenance guy, Manny. I tried to show him the door. Susan and Gregory—they were screaming the whole time, and he just looked at me like I was bonkers and told me it’s not a door, just a blank wall. I even tried to convince him to hook his fingers around the handle and pull, but he told me it was just a dirty crack in the mortar and he wasn’t going to stick his fingers in. Then he said I needed help and left.\n\nI don’t know what to do. \n\nI don’t know what to do.\n\nI came back to my room and, because the apartment is so filthy (it’s usually Susan who keeps things organized and keeps *me* organized), I started cleaning out the desk drawer again. And I found another note. It was written on an old receipt, but it caught my notice because I didn’t recognize the handwriting at all. It was a spidery, shaky script, as if the pen was held by someone with very unsteady hands. It read:\n\n*If you open the door, you invite it in.*\n\nI turned over the receipt to see when this note had been written, and got a chill because… the receipt was from months ago. And it wasn’t Susan’s. \n\nIt was Gregory’s.\n\nDid Susan… did she invite something in, when she found that old man dead? \n\n\\*\n\n12/14/22\n\nI went down and mudded and painted over the door today. I ignored the screams—it’s in my head, right?—no one else can see the door, so it *must* be in my head. So I just mudded over the door and the screams and then waited for it to dry and then painted it all the same flat gray. I also mudded over the handle, so there’s no possible way to open it anymore. \n\nOnly once I painted over it, and got back upstairs into my own apartment, did I realize how bone weary I was. And filthy. I called Manny again. He’s sick to death of me—I’m surprised he picked up. He actually sounded less cranky with me this time. More just… concerned. I told him I painted over the door. That I mudded over everything. I just needed to talk to someone.\n\n“Sorry. I hope it doesn’t cause much trouble. I just didn’t want to see it anymore. It’s… the paint wasn’t a perfect match, but the color is pretty close. I hope that’s okay.”\n\n“Okay, Susan,” he said. “Okay. Thank you for telling me.”\n\nI frowned. “Susan’s not here. I think she’s—”\n\n“Behind the door, I know. Ok… look, don’t worry about the paint. I’m off work soon, I’ll come over and take a look and make sure it’s all mudded over properly and everything. You just promise me you won’t go down to the basement again, okay? There’s no reason for you to be down there.”\n\nI felt myself bristling, because he was talking to me as if I were some sort of child, or as if I’d gone senile. I glowered into the phone, but relaxed a bit as he said that he was going to be at my apartment that evening just to “check up on things in my unit.” It made me feel strangely better, even though I knew he was still thinking of me as some crazy lady who should be sleeping in a padded room. I thanked him and hung up.\n\nLooked around my place. God, it was a mess. Without Susan to clean, the pile of dishes had been sitting in the sink growing fuzz for… honestly, I don’t even remember the last time I had a meal. At some point I’d filled water around the dishes, but it was fetid, new forms of life evolving from the primordial soup. Pretty gross. Not to mention I hadn’t showered in… well, my clothes still had paint on them and felt as if they had crusted to me. And since I didn’t want Manny to think I was both crazy *and* filthy, I figured I’d best make an effort to at least correct one of those things. I hauled myself out of my chair and changed my clothes, then went into the kitchen, shuffling toward the looming dishes with a leery eye. \n\nI was in the middle of draining and re-filling the sink with soapy water when Manny arrived:\n\n*BOOM BOOM BOOM*\n\n“Coming!” I called, turning off the water and shuffling to the door, opening it with, “Thanks so much for com—”\n\nThe words died in my throat.\n\nThere was no one outside.\n\nI stepped back, panicked. I realized that I was standing in the basement. There at the bottom of the door was a face. The face I’d sketched in my drawing. Screaming. I recognized it now. It was *my* face. Screaming from the bottom of the door I’d just opened. \n\n\\*\n\n??/??/??\n\nI don’t know where I am now. It’s dark. There’s nothing here—no food or water. The notebook is still in my lap, but I… it takes so much energy to write. I think this will be my last entry. I can’t leave. The door won’t open. I try banging but no one hears me screaming. More and more, I’m starting to suspect I am actually in the basement. I’m in the door. The one I mudded and painted over. And maybe that’s why no one can hear me. I know it sounds crazy but I think when I opened the door, I somehow entered the basement. \n\nIs Manny still coming? I don’t think he’ll find me in the basement.\n\nI’ve been pounding the door. No one answers.\n\nIt took Gregory. It took Susan. It took Susan. It took Susan.",

        "text": "This story was told by my friend Sebastian during a Halloween event at my school when i was in senior high school \nwhich surely still sends shivers down my spine.  \n\n\"Back when i was in my junior year in highschool back in 2019, just right across the street was a family of 5 which had 3 children, the eldest one named Michael was a graduating junior high, the middle child named Jeffrey was at the second year of junior high and the youngest named Gabriella was a graduating student in elementary.\n\nI got along pretty well with Michael when i was a kid, and boy i do love asking questions but he always has answers for all of them. \n\nEveryday i join him and his siblings to take the tricycle to school everyday and the young ones left early at 3:00, but on that particular Thursday afternoon it was only me who left the and Michael was no where to be found outside.\n\nWhen i waited outside for Michael but he was nowhere to be found so i went to ask his teachers and they said he left already.\n\nI went home too and saw him with dark circles under his eyes and that he looks stressed and tired which is pretty common among all highschool students but not for him because back then he was always happy and upbeat but now as school gets more and more tiring and stressful the more it puts pressure on him as time goes on not to mention the responsibilities that he has to do at home \n\nI texted his siblings on why he looked like that, they said \"Oh he's just staying up all night cause he has a lot of homework and projects to do, he also lost his wallet on the way home.\", so i just sent and ok emoji and did my homework to which was a bit hard since its only the third year of junior high.\n\nBy the time it was at 10:00 pm i was already at bed watching anything that pops up on YouTube until i heard a gate open, turns out it was Michael but was he doing outside? \n\nOn his right hand was a piece of paper and within seconds a group of black cats and dogs walk in front of him, and as i watched from a little gap within the curtain the cats and dogs started to transform into humanoid-like creatures with thick black hair and long and pointy claws and ears, the middle one was taller and more wider than him, it must be their leader, around it where more creatures just like it but they where on the ground in a crawling state and they where smaller than the big one in the middle, they must be its minions.\n\nWithin the background i see Micheal give the piece of paper to the big creature and it read it, and in a blink of an eye he vanished, i was terrified and shocked from what i just witness.\n\nI couldn't sleep that night, by the time it was morning, when we where having breakfast with my parents on a Friday morning i told them what happened last night and they told me they where a group of Aswang, creatures of the night with an insatiable thirst for blood, they can take forms of either a black cat, dog or pig and sometimes a normal human form.\n\nThey ask what was the piece of paper that he was holding and what did it read, i also didn't know what i read.\n\nAs i continue my day i couldn't get rid of what i just saw from that night, and later on as nighttime falls when i was at bed at 10:00 pm i heard something outside like something was banging or metal sheets as i looked outside.\n\nI saw the creatures again and the leader was holding Micheal's lifeless body along with a wooden coffin, his body was filled with stitches around his body. \n\nHe wasn't moving, then the creatures placed his body in the coffin, in a funeral like position and the left him there with the same paper on it but it's now covered with blood. \n\nAfter what felt like hours, u checked the time and sure enough it was midnight which is good enough for me to curiously check out his body and what happened to it, as i snuck out through my bedroom door and past my parents' bedroom i walked downstairs and unlocked the door quietly and opened it as i walked outside the house and approached Micheal's dead body i picked up the piece of paper and it read\n\n\"Before you kill me like a savage beast or take my soul and add it to your collection of victims, here's what you have to do:\n1. After killing me pickup the rest of my remains and put it on a wooden coffin which is at my backyard\n2. Place me in a funeral like position\n3. Leave without being seen\"\n\nI was terrified and sad from what i read, knowing that he is now gone forever and that it is not safe anymore to go outside at night, and that he took his own life with the assistance from supernatural beings.\n\nIn the morning the family held a funeral for Micheal and the police reported it as murder and assault due to the amount of bruises and stitches around his body which indicated that he died from losing too much blood, I don't know if i can recover from all of this.\"",

        "text": "I slid my phone into its holder, jutting out of the center console as my car's engine hummed to life.\n\nNerves buzzed at the periphery of my consciousness like some distant swarm. I sucked in a breath, willing my mind to quiet, before opening my messages to send another text. \n\nI tapped the most recent conversation, swallowing hard as I looked at the string of messages I’d sent before, all unanswered, before punching in another.\n\n‘Hey B, I’m heading out rn, you otw?’\n\nI fought the urge to call, hands gripping the steering wheel tight as I backed out of my driveway, and began following the GPS instructions towards the cabin.\n\nI glanced at the ETA, it would be a little over two hours to get there, driving from my family's house in Evanston, Illinois to the cabin we’d rented near Matthiessen State Park all the way in Oglesby.\n\nThe trip was rocky before it had even begun, with two of the four who’d planned out the weekend getaway having to cancel for various reasons. \n\nAs I made my way out of my neighborhood, and onto the main road, I couldn’t help but worry that Beatriz's relative radio silence was a sign that yet another kink had entered our plans, and that I might be alone for the weekend, hours away from home.\n\nAfter how that night would unfold, I can only imagine that was the best-case scenario.\n\nThe drive out of the city was an uneventful one. Though I usually found the trek out of the exurbs of the city and through the rolling fields and farmland of central Illinois a calming one, a time that allows my mind to wander and dwell on things that daily life hardly left the space for, this time I found the drive to be an anxious one. \n\nMy eyes fell on my phone once every few minutes, hoping to find a confirmation of Beatriz’ approach that never came. \n\nWith every glance, the pit in my gut grew deeper, and by the time I was pulling up to the location in my GPS, I was all but certain I would be spending the weekend alone. As I passed the sign welcoming me to Oglesby, marking the final leg of my journey, I’d all but accepted that this would be a solo trip.\n\n“So be it, Jenn, I guess it’s a weekend retreat for one at a discount,” I chirped aloud, trying to stir up some measure of optimism.\n\n“Thanks guys.” I couldn’t help but let some of the irritated sarcasm seep into my voice.\n\nI resolved to stop peeking at my phone for anything but the GPS for the rest of the drive and made my way on to the sounds of one of my favorite local band’s latest album. \n\nThe vast open farmland interspersed with truck stops and off-ramps to sleepy little towns soon gave way to dense tree cover, the view quickly going from farm to forest.\n\nAs the GPS led me to a small, sparsely populated neighborhood within the forest-covered outskirts of one of the towns near the state park, the ETA reading three minutes I began to truly consider the prospect of a weekend alone here. \n\nI moved slowly down the winding road, lined with trees and thick brush, through which only the odd house was visible at the ends gravel driveways. \n\n“Christ, Justine has me out here in the fucking sticks.” I spoke under my breath, as if worried one of the locals might hear me through my car, peering like a nervous tourist out my windows, as I searched for the house we’d rented. \n\nMy eyes snapped forward, a flash of motion from the brush in front of me caught my attention just in time to feel my heart plummeting. I slammed the breaks, making the vehicle squeal in protest and sending my body jerking forward. My head nearly collided with the steering wheel as something flew forth from the woods to the right of the road, darting into the forest opposite. \n\nI caught only the tail end, legs bent and covered in a matted brown fur that I imagined must belong to a deer or something like it.\n\nI huffed in a breath, my heart pounding almost painfully, and tried to gather my faculties as the sudden burst of adrenaline faded.\n\nAs I did so, a sour, coppery sort of scent began to drift on the air, an awful sort of reek that made my face screw and stomach turn. Despite my still racing heart, I continued forward, the smell far too overpowering to remain in place.\n\nAs I continued forth on the final minute of my drive, I felt the air of optimism I’d tried to maintain waver, as the strange, putrid scent slowly faded from the air.\n\n“*Truly, a lovely start to my weekend.”*\n\nThe sun was dipping low beneath the treeline, painting the sky a watercolor canvas of oranges and blues, a sight I couldn’t help but feel a bit of wonder at. For all that had happened, the sight of that Illinois sky in dusk reminded me just why I was coming out here, getting out into nature and away from the city.\n\nAs I rounded another bend in the road, at the end of a long, gravel driveway, dotted with spots of grass and other stubborn greenery growing through it as though it hadn’t been adequately maintained for a while - the house came into view. \n\nAny sense of relief I felt at finally arriving at the end of my journey, was tainted by the immediate irritation I felt as I got a look at my abode for the weekend. Just to be sure I’d arrived at the right location, I opened my phone and found the reservation I’d been sent. It was the house alright, except the house in picture looked about a decade newer, driveway spick and span, wood almost gleaming with a new finish, whereas now? \n\nNow it appeared all but forgotten. The wooden sign on the house that read out the number of the address hung lopsided haphazardly over the door, the roof was missing more than a few shingles, and the exterior walls as well as the porch were all chipped and covered in a thick sheet of dust, dirt, and leaves.\n\nI had half a mind to turn back at that moment. Inconvenience after inconvenience had tipped me past the point of patience, and the last thing I could imagine wanting to do was spend a week alone in a dump. \n\nYet as I sat with my thoughts, confronting the idea of another several hours on the exhaustion-inducing, farm-lined roads, I determined to at least see the inside before I made a decision.\n\nI grabbed my phone, swiping through the messages once more to no avail, before stepping out the car, hauling my bag out with the other arm.\n\nA chill tingled beneath my skin as I stepped into the cool fall air, a gust sending leaves scattering past.\n\nI made my way to the door, pushing open the top of the light fixture as advised in our reservation, reaching inside.\n\nI stifled a yelp as I felt cobwebs breaking beneath my hand as I felt for, and eventually found the key, quickly drawing it back and wiping my hand across my pants.\n\nThe key clicked in the door, and I pushed inside.\n\nMy eyes widened, and I almost dropped my bag in shock as I took in the interior. It was…nice. A far cry from the exterior, the living room I stepped into was every bit the homey cabin vibe I had hoped. \n\nI stepped inside, suddenly feeling the excitement of before rekindled as I hurried about the house. The kitchen was just as impressive, decorated in a cute floral wallpaper that spoke of an older taste, and were adorned with the pictures of an elderly couple who I assumed must own the home, confirming the theory.\n\nI made my way to the master bedroom, placing my bag on the bed after taking a glance at the other two, settling on the biggest. Pulling out my phone, I was ready to record a video to send to my friends, rubbing it in a bit for their flakiness when I saw the notification for a text. Seeing Beatriz’ name, I hurried to open it, fully expecting an apology for leaving me alone this week.\n\nI felt a surge of excitement as I read the message. It had come ten minutes before, a little after I’d arrived while I’d been taking stock of the house.\n\n*Hey, sorry, overslept like a mf. I’m getting ready and I’ll be on my way in ten, should be there around 9ish, traffic sucks rn.*\n\nI nearly leapt in celebration, the fact that I wouldn’t have to confront the next few nights alone immediately making the prospect of the weekend ahead all the more exciting. A glance at the time told me it was 5:54. \n\nI quickly sent my reply, including a brief description of the house as if to sweeten the deal and ensure no last minute backing out, and before long, I had settled into the bed in the master bedroom, as music playing from my phone on the end table beside the bed. \n\nAt some point the exhaustion of the drive took its toll, lulling me into a deep sleep. \n\nI awoke in confusion hours later, to a room pitch black, the air thick heavy with an awful scent. My heart began to race as my eyes scanned the heavy darkness, struggling to use what little light came in through the window to orient myself. \n\nIt was open, just a few inches but enough so that the room had taken the same biting chill of the air outside. In my sleep-dazed mind the temperature was all I noticed at first, hardly stopping to think just why it was open..\n\nA digital clock glared at me in the darkness from the shelf across from the bed, its red glow offering little more than the ability to read it.\n\n*12:42.*\n\n*I overslept.* It was the first thought my bleary mind conjured, a vague sense of panic forming. \n\n*Krrrrk.*\n\nThe sound of groaning wood from weight against a floorboard rang out amidst the blackness. My every hair stood on end, skin prickling as sudden panic bubbled in my gut. I scanned the darkness desperately, searching for what made the noise, fully expecting to find some masked maniac standing overhead.\n\nAs my eyes adjusted, I caught sight of the shape of someone in the doorway, and for a moment, I felt a scream rising in my throat. \n\nIt was only as I began to realize that my potential attacker was 5’3, and rather familiar, that I felt comfortable reaching for the bedside lamp, flicking it on. As the person came into view, I felt both a surge of relief and irritation, as well as a faint, but pounding ache in my head.\n\n“Beatriz, what the *hell*?”\n\nShe stood just past the doorway, her hair hanging at either side, errant leaves and streaks of dirt visible on her clothing. My vision seemed to swim with an odd, surreal sort of effect, the light around her appearing streaky and hazy for a moment.\n\n“You…okay?” I asked, trying to rub the latent effects of sleep from my eyes.\n\nMy words seemed to shake her free of whatever spell she was under, her head rising, eyes locking on mine with a hazy gleam of recognition and something else unfamiliar. \n\nShe sighed, shuddering for a moment as if caught by some breeze only she could feel, before nodding slowly.\n\n“I’m…okay.” She moved her jaw, for a moment, as if it was injured and required some practice before proper use, before stepping into the room.\n\nI sat up fully, the final wisps of sleep dissipating from amidst my thoughts, as Beatriz made her way into the light of the room. \n\nMy eyes shot open wide as I got a good look at the state of her. I sprang up from bed.\n\n“Oh my god, what the fuck happened?!” \n\nHer clothes were tattered, the brown sweater she was wearing was ripped in several places, with leaves knotting themselves into the material, and dirt smeared in several places. \n\nThe tights she wore were hardly in better condition, even her skin bore cuts and scratches, and all the signs of some violent incident. It was as though she’d run a country mile through the woods.\n\nShe looked down at herself as if my question had reminded her of something, the look in her eyes still…hazy and unrecognizable as she did so.\n\nIn an instance, any semblance of fear I’d felt before was gone, replaced only by concern and worry for my friend. I made my way over to her, crossing the room without a thought, raising my hand to her face. \n\nAs my hand met her skin, I felt a chill rippled down my back. Her cheek was *icy* cold, as if she’d been out in the frigid night for so long her very flesh and blood had frozen, and I drew my hand away instinctively.\n\n“Jesus Christ, you’re freezing!” \n\nI hurried to the side of the bed, snatching off the comforter, and throwing it around her in an instant. I tried to usher her forward, towards the bed, and for a moment she stood firm, her body so stiff it seemed impossible to move, before she relented, trudging forward with me.\n\n“Do I need to call an ambulance?” I started, as I got her settled on the bed. \n\nShe shook her head, staring up at me, a look in her eyes I couldn’t begin to understand and yet,, made me feel somehow deeply uneasy. That distant pounding in my head swelled steadily, the faint thud now an aching drumbeat.\n\n“What - what happened?”\n\nShe watched me for a moment longer, and I felt a cold chill prickle at the back of my neck as I waited for a response. The wind picked up outside, making the house groan under its weight. My stomach twisted, for reasons I couldn’t understand as I waited in silence for her to speak. \n\nAfter seconds that seemed to stretch into uneasy minutes, she spoke, voice hoarse at first.\n\n“I’m - okay. My car broke down. Just down the road. Had to walk.”\n\nShe sounded…odd. Like she was reciting a practiced line. \n\nMy eyes widened at that.\n\n“You - walked here? From - where? Chrissake, B, why wouldn’t you just call me?”\n\nI sat beside her, almost recoiling as our skin met, her’s cold and clammy. \n\nAs I did so, I began to realize that the stench, that acrid smell like burning rubber, seemed to roll off of her. It was so strong, too strong and too…metallic to be made by her body surely, and I assumed it must be from whatever happened to her car. \n\nStill, it felt wrong in a way I couldn’t quite peg, a smell like an electrical fire seeming to pour forth from her with no reasonable source.\n\n“My phone - it's dead. I left it in the car. It’s okay. It's fine.”\n\nShe smiled, a quick, unfriendly twitch of an expression, though something in her eyes didn’t  quite match.\n\nHer eyes appeared…glassy almost, focused but unfamiliar twin pools of oil, beneath which something else seemed to linger just below the surface. There was something odd, I couldn’t quite put to words about her face, as though there were things in plain sight I was missing. \n\nThe harder I tried to make sense of it though, the more my head began to pound, until the pain was splitting, and I tried no longer. \n\nI felt unsure of what to do. Like I was watching a movie I’d started halfway through, I knew something was going on, but couldn’t tell what. \n\nFor what she was telling me she seemed far too…calm, which contrasted with her bedraggled appearance only served to make me feel uneasy.\n\n“How did you get in?” I asked, rising as a chill rippled through me on an errant breeze that came through the window.\n\nI made my way around the bed and over to the window, pulling it shut with much exertion as the old wood seemed to fight against me.\n\n“The door. It was unlocked.”\n\nThat puzzled me. I quickly tried to rack my brain to remember if, on arrival, I had indeed forgotten to lock the front door. I could find no certain answer, as my mind began second-guessing what fragmented memory I might have of doing so, and with little reason to be disbelieving, I accepted.\n\n“Well shit,” I breathed, exhaling as if to relieve the mental pressure that the night, and her story seemed to convey. \n\nI couldn’t quite put my finger on it, there was something *off*. It was like the feeling when you’re in a dream and can tell something is wrong but not exactly *what*. I wondered if perhaps it was the lingering sleep still clouding my mind with its faint haze and putting me on edge.\n\nA part of me wanted to press further, but for what, I wasn’t sure, and it was clear to me that Beatriz probably needed a shower and some sleep. With that thought, I realized I was still exhausted, the initial shock of Beatriz’ appearance all but fully faded, the waning adrenaline leaving weariness in its place.\n\n“Well if you’re sure you’re okay then, I can show you to the guest bedrooms, and the bathroom.” I finally spoke after a moment.\n\n“The one down the hall is the nicest of the three.” \n\nI stood from the bed, making my way to the door and waiting for her to follow. She watched me, eyes following me to the doorway as I did so. I turned, reaching into the hallway and feeling around until I felt the lightswitch, flicking it on and abating the thick darkness that filled the hall.\n\n“Do you -” I sucked in a breath, jumped back, and collided into the wall with one motion. \n\nBeatriz stood behind me, watching with those eyes that seemed so…empty. I hadn’t even heard her get up, despite both the creakiness of the old bed and floorboards, nothing. To my mind, it was like she’d practically teleported.\n\n“You scared me, girl,” I breathed, feeling the faint nausea left in place of a sudden shock, as I gripped my chest.\n\n“Sorry,” she sighed, her breath seemed to crackle and hiss with the speech, “I’m right behind you.”\n\nI nodded, turning to lead her to the other rooms, but in doing so, I couldn’t ignore the hair standing up on my back now, suddenly feeling uncomfortable with my friend behind me. \n\nI didn’t know what had happened to her, and only had a suspicion she wasn’t telling me something, but her behavior so far had been just…*odd* all around. \n\nI figured perhaps it was an effect of being out in the sticks, surrounded by dark woods and the croaks and cries of nature, causing me to be paranoid. I tried to ignore the feeling, though there was no way to fully shake it.\n\nBesides, my head was pounding at this point. I couldn’t dismiss the possibility that it was playing some part in how...weird everything felt. I made a mental note to seek out a doctor in the morning if it hadn’t returned to normal.\n\nI led her to the largest of the available rooms, clicking on the light and standing by the doorway, waiting for her to look around.\n\nShe shuffled over beside me, peering into the room with that same look of disinterest, before nodding slowly.\n\n“That works.” A smile spread over her lips. There was no warmth in the expression. It was cold, unloving, the sort that made me feel as if there were some joke I wasn’t in on.\n\n*There’s something there…something you’re missing.* I couldn’t help the thought, growing all the more present as her smile sent chills through me, I couldn’t shake the odd feeling that I was missing something in plain sight. \n\nI grit my teeth unconsciously, her response only serving to aggravate my unease.\n\nNausea made steady tumbles in my gut, as did that smell…like burning plastic in an electrical fire seemed to pour forth from her.\n\n“Cool, do you wanna get your stuff, or check out the bathroom or…?” I trailed off, waiting for her to say anything more than a single sentence. \n\nI could hear the wind picking up outside. \n\nIt carried through the cracks in the windows, and spaces between doors with a ghostly hum, making the house creak in protest under its weight and the hair along my arms raise.\n\n“No stuff,” She said, eyes never shifting as they remained locked on mine, stern and hard.\n\n“It’s in the car. Just around the corner.\"\n\nHer head nodded to one side as if to indicate where her vehicle waited. \n\nThe corners of her lips twitched as though some secret joke had mustered the ghost of a smile, and her eyes widened slightly. \n\nSilence followed, her words seemed to hang  there between the two of us. \n\nThe wind continued its baleful howl outside, making phantom whistles as it made its way through the house, while the air seemed to crackle with a surreal, dream-like sort of static.\n\nDespite having almost five inches in height on her, and being in a bit better shape due to my more recent history of athletics, it felt as though she towered over me. \n\nHer gaze felt alien and hostile, and there was something more I couldn’t put my finger on, something to do with the almost mask-like stillness of her face that made my stomach turn. It felt as though she were waiting for something. \n\n“Do you want me to drive you to your car?” I asked, feeling less than certain myself as I made the offer.\n\nThat brought a smile to her face. I regretted the words as quickly as I’d spoken them.\n\nFrom the moment I’d met B, way back in highschool, one thing that had always stood out was her smile. It was the toothy sort of grin that filled her whole face, and couldn’t help but spread to others.\n\nThis was something different, it felt less like an expression of joy and every bit like a predator baring its fangs. Her teeth seemed…strange, in a way I couldn’t quite make sense of. It was as though they were too big for her mouth but just barely so. \n\nI tried to keep the unease from my expression, though I’m uncertain how effective it was, as my gaze ran across her face. It wasn’t just her expressions, or smile, the longer I looked the more details seemed to emerge that were almost…but not quite right, in such a way as to feel disturbingly uncanny.\n\n‘You’re exhausted,’ the skeptical, rational side of my mind called out, ‘Your brain is still half-asleep, and you’re seeing things.’ \n\nI could think of no other alternative that could be based in reality, and didn’t leave me facing illogical and deeply *disquieting* conclusions.\n\n*‘Forget reality, for a second. This all feels* *wrong**.’*  My mind continued its silent tug of war, when she spoke.\n\nI felt a steady sleet form in my veins, as she spoke, and for a moment I could almost swear there was something…*else* in her voice. Another, barely above a hiss, but menacing in a way I had never felt before. \n\n“*I would…*a - ppreciate that, my friend,”\n\nIt was gone as quickly as it appeared, leaving my stomach in knots, and me to wonder if it hadn’t been yet another strange effect of my mind.\n\nI nodded slowly.\n\n‘*You’re going to rationalize yourself to* *death* *tonight,*’ a part of my mind echoed.\n\n‘*She’s your best friend. Because she’s acting weird as fuck, what, she’s possessed? This is real life, not a movie.*’ \n\nRationality made its rebuttal. \n\nI just wished I felt more convinced.\n\nIt was Beatriz of course. There was no doubt I was looking upon the face of my friend, no matter how many *disconcerting* little…details there appeared to be. So *why* did it feel so much like I was looking upon someone, or something malevolent and unfamiliar?\n\nThe thought of being isolated in a car with her, so close and inescapable, made my throat run dry and my heart thud uneasily. No matter how hard I tried to explain away the surreal eeriness of the night, it seemed to hold me firm in its grip, claws sinking in at any attempt to escape.\n\nI could feel her eyes burning holes through me, that unloving smile frozen in place, and felt compelled to break the silence.\n\n“Well, take your time to clean up then,” I said, no longer waiting for her to make a choice and offering my own. \n\nI needed her away for me for some time, just long enough to leave me with my thoughts and decipher just what was going on, and why one of my best friends was making me feel so deeply *unsafe*.\n\nHer head cocked to the side, eyes narrowing for a moment, in an expression oddly reminiscent of  some prowling wolf, mild interest cut with something all too similar to malevolence. \n\nAfter a moment, she nodded, and after a few more I realized she was waiting for me to lead her there.\n\nI stepped past her, moving towards the bathroom and flicking on the light, ushering her in with a smile that hung uneasily.\n\nShe stepped into the bathroom, moving past me, and as she did the cold that seemed to waft off of her leaving goosebumps along my skin. That awful, burnt rubber smell hung heavy in her hair. \n\nI pulled the door shut behind her with a nod and a feigned smile. She watched me over her shoulder, eyes seeming to burn holes into me even through the mirror, never so much as wavering from my face until the door finally closed.\n\nI waited until I heard the squeal of the faucet and rush of the water, before I felt comfortable letting myself relax a bit.\n\nI sighed, feeling an immense relief having her gaze off of me, as though some unseen valve had been opened, allowing all the pressure in the room to seep out.\n\n*What in the hell has gotten into her?* Finally alone, it seemed to hit me all at once how utterly unusual the entire night had been, surreal and dreamlike, like waking up halfway through a nightmare, and I found myself searching for answers. The possibilities felt endless, though none seemed right.\n\nI considered that maybe it was drugs, but for as long as I’d known B, she was straight as an arrow when it came to any sort of substance, and I couldn’t see that having changed in a day or two.\n\nPerhaps I was still asleep. It would explain the strangeness of it all, and that unshakable feeling…like the air buzzing with a surreal,  otherworldly sort of energy all too familiar in dreams and nightmares. But no, even that felt wrong. It was much too detailed, too vivid, I was surely awake. \n\nI grabbed my keys from atop the night stand, head spinning. \n\nThen *what?*\n\n*I’m missing something.* That thought again, I couldn’t shake it. \n\n*Something happened, something’s wrong here and I’m just…missing it*.\n\nAs if an answer from the universe, I heard an angry buzz from down the hall, coming from my room. It took only a moment to realize it was my cell phone, vibrating against the table by the bed. The alert for a text.\n\nMy heart leapt, hoping for a moment that one of my friends was texting to tell me they were on their way, and I wouldn’t be left to figure this all out alone for long. As I made my way into the room, hurrying to the desk before the buzzing could cease, I couldn’t shake the anticipation doing somersaults in my gut.\n\nAs I saw the name, there in white across a black background, floating above the green and red call symbols, anticipation gave way to confusion. My head pounded now, a sharp splitting pain.\n\nAnd confusion, to a cold, awful dread. \n\n“I’m ready.” \n\nI nearly jumped from my skin, stomach doing a full 360 as I heard Beatriz’ voice from just behind me.\n\nSpinning to face her, I clicked the power button, silencing the call and holding the phone behind my back. Silently, I prayed to any god listening that she hadn’t seen the screen, heart thudding, each pound sending rippling nausea through my gut.\n\n“Okay,” I said, wanting to cringe at the far too artificial cheer in my tone. \n\n“I’m uh, just gonna use the bathroom.” \n\nShe didn’t respond, and the thud of my heart grew painful in the following seconds as she remained in place, not once budging from the doorway.\n\nHer eyes…squinted and seemingly stared through me scanning my face like some silent interrogation, had they always been so…odd. The color in their irises was a startling amber, almost yellow, the pupils long and thin and beady.\n\nMy head throbbed, the ever-present ache now something with teeth and claws as it dug into the soft flesh around it. Again that feeling, as though I was staring at a painting and only seeing half the picture. Her face…it seemed to shudder.\n\nBefore long more details became apparent, and it seemed the longer I looked the less like Beatriz she appeared. Her teeth…had they always ended in such unusual points? I was certain they hadn’t looked like that earlier, a mouthful of little daggers flecked in drool.\n\n“Okay,” she spoke, in a voice that sounded more like a hiss.\n\nMy heart was in my throat as I tip-toed past her, never once taking my eyes of hers, suddenly predatory and cat-like, until I was in the hall and hurried to the bathroom. \n\nI pressed my back to the door as it shut behind me, clicking the lock as the panic allowed itself to finally pour over in the form of gasping breaths and an unending tremor. It was too much, I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare or some horror movie, invisible cameras following and unheard music ramping up in anticipation of an awful climax.\n\nI peered through the window opposite me, a few feet above the toilet, finding only darkness to greet me. I flipped open the toilet seat with my foot, making an intentional racket as I did so before quickly opening my phone. \n\n“Please, please please,” I muttered, not sure who I was pleading to that somehow, I’d seen wrong in the moments before she’d returned, somehow I had misread the name on my screen. My heart fell, as I only found the confirmation I’d expected.\n\n*Missed call from Beatriz*, followed by two missed texts, and a voicemail.\n\nIt took a moment for me to open the message with the tremor in my hand, but when I did, I could feel dread running its skeletal hands along my back, raising gooseflesh in its wake.\n\n“*Hey, Jenn. Don’t hate me please, but I can’t make it this weekend, I’m soooorry. My grandmother is sick and the family is running out to Indy to be with her*. *I absolutely owe you one.* *Hope you’re not mad, try to enjoy yourself -’”* the rest of the message faded as the phone fell away from my face, a voice I knew to be none other than Beatriz’ speaking on the other end. \n\nIt had been left hours ago. Her most recent text was inquiring on whether or not I’d settled in, and I didn’t respond.\n\nThe words in her voicemail seemed to echo in my head.\n\nI stared forward, dark conclusions emerging to the forefront of my mind, that I realized had been lingering there for quite a while.\n\n*She’s not here. Beatriz isn’t here.* \n\nThe faint tremors present since I’d entered the bathroom rose to a seismic shake as the thought rang out in my head, and as if in response, I could hear the faint creak of a floorboard from just outside the bathroom.\n\n*Then what who…what is that?*\n\nA sound - raspy, gasping breath, wet and labored grew audible just on the opposite side and made my skin crawl like insects had burrowed beneath it. \n\n*Crrkk. Crrkkk. Crrkkkk.*\n\nThree long hisses, one after the other, something sharp against wood. It took me only a moment to come to the realization that she - it…whatever was on the opposite side, was *scratching* at the door.\n\n“*I’m ready t - to  go.*” I shuddered as she - it spoke, the voice was deep, uneven and inhuman, like a recording of Beatriz made awful and distorted, yet somehow it affected a sing-song pitch.\n\nThe scratching grew louder, more feverish, as though there were some clawed animal on the other side desperate to gain entry.\n\nThe door shook slightly, as the clawing slowly devolved into a scratching thud against it, making the surrounding walls shake. Slowly, I lowered myself to the ground, an odd idea emerging. \n\nThe tile of the floor sent chills through my legs, as I pressed myself to the floor. Opening the camera on my phone, I struggled for a moment to focus it beneath the crack in the door. I wanted to see what was out there, though I was disturbingly aware it would not be my friend.\n\nFor a few seconds the screen remained a blur, the camera adjusting to whatever lay on the opposite end, appearing as just smeared light and shadow. As it began to shift, I could make out the feet and legs of the thing on the opposite end.\n\nIts feet were more like clawed hooves, ending in gnarled digits, and most disturbingly they appeared twisted as though from below its knees everything had turned 180 degrees.\n\nI felt my head spinning as though I were falling, every horrific assumption I’d made feeling somehow lackluster.\n\nThe breath caught in my throat, my thumb shook.\n\n*Be - beep.* \n\nThe chirp of my phone, followed by a flash as my thumb hit the camera button.\n\nFor a moment, maybe half a second, there was nothing but icy fear and the feeling of my heart in my throat, and it seemed as though the world fell still.\n\nThen the camera filled, a blur of red and black and terrible gold, and when it adjusted I was staring into a nightmare. The thing on the opposite end of the door let out an awful, shrieking cackle, its ruinous face filling my screen. \n\nSkin hung in tatters from a massive fleshy face gleaming with slick blood and other fluids, like some swollen, flayed corpse. At the center, those two cats' eyes gleamed with hunger, humor, and awful intent. \n\nI stumbled back scurrying across the floor, and just barely moving away in time to avoid the grasping fingers that shot beneath the door, long and gnarled and ended in obsidian claws. \n\nIts laughter filled the air, somehow the sound of many discordant voices cackling and hollering and shrieking all at once. The door shook violently, the wood giving an awful, ominous *crack.*\n\n“*Jennny, Jennnny, let me in Jenny..”* It howled in that inhumane voice, somehow making my name feel like an insult. The door gave a great thud between each word. \n\nI could almost see it in my mind's eye, colliding its head against the door, harder and harder, that awful smile growing wider as it grew closer to me.\n\nI knew I had minutes, maybe less before it got in. I opened the phone to call the police, then remembered the drive out here, feeling a deep sinking feeling. I hadn’t seen a police department anywhere along my drive, and I couldn’t imagine any could be here soon. \n\nNo, I had to do something. \n\nI scanned the bathroom, my eyes falling on the window. My hand practically flew to my pocket, my heart surging as I felt my keys. \n\nI flicked on the water, in a vain attempt to hide the sound of what I was going to do, as I grabbed ahold of the towel rack, gritted my teeth and pulled as hard as I could muster. It slid from the wall with surprising ease, and I had to stumble to avoid falling flat on my back. I felt a shock of pain in my ankle, and tears shooting to my eyes. I had no time to think about it. I pulled myself onto the toilet, balancing on my good leg. Shutting my eyes tight, I reeled the towel rack backwards, and sent it careening into the window. It cracked on the first try, a spiderweb pattern splaying out across its surface.\n\nAs if in response, the things horrid laughter descended into something more animalistic, a howling shriek like some supernatural predator.\n\nThe door shook harder than ever before, sending a shower of splinters across the bathroom as a long crack appeared down its center. I could see it on the other side. \n\nI felt chills run along my body, my stomach tightening like a fist at the sound I couldn’t even conceive of in a nightmare, but I couldn’t stop. \n\nI pulled back, gritting my teeth and shutting my eyes, and -\n\n*CRASH*\n\nThe window exploded outward in a shower of glass. I knocked away the largest of the jagged edges lining the frame, as another slam, followed by yet another spray of wood spurred me forth. It would have to do.\n\nI pulled my arms through, using them to reach out against either side of the cold brick of the house. I could feel the glass digging then, tearing long cuts through my skin with every movement, gritting my teeth and muttering a silent curse as I pulled myself through headlong. It dug into my sides, the angle made it difficult to pull myself through without coming away with a half an inch of glass in my hip.\n\nI had to pause to try and adjust my position, peering down and doing what I could to knock the offending shard loose without stabbing myself. \n\nIt was then that I heard a sound from within that sent me into a frantic panic, a strange mix of the booming crack of the door giving way, and an awful, angry shriek from the thing pretending to be Beatriz.\n\nI felt warm blood pooling in my shirt as I forced myself forward with a kick, digging my fingers into the concrete as I fell forward. \n\nThe earth sped forward to meet me, and my hands did what they could to shield my fall but -\n\nMy leg screamed out with a blinding pain, and I found myself doing the same, as I felt a hand close around the ankle, its grip like iron and steel.\n\nI twisted my head, peering through the tears flooding my eyes at my captor. It shrieked and hissed at me somehow at once, that swollen, macabre parody of a face baring its dozens of fanged teeth in an expression that could only mean fury. \n\nIt began to tug with surprising strength, pulling my leg halfway through the window and breaking off the chunk of glass in my thigh. I could hardly hear my own screams through the ringing in my head. \n\n*It’s going to kill me. I’m going to die here.* \n\nBlood and snot ran down my face as I tried to find some purchase, something to grip and pull myself free as I dangled uselessly against the wall, every second more of my body sliding back within the house.\n\nI had only seconds at most, before I was inside again, and I knew at that point any chance of escape was gone. \n\nI set my jaw, its iron grip making my leg shriek in a pain so explosive my insides turned to liquid. I reeled back, the motion only worsening the pain, and with all I could muster planted a furious kick at the center of its face. \n\nThe reaction was immediate, as I felt something give way beneath my foot and heard an awful *crack*. Seconds later I collided with the ground.  The creature reeled away with a shriek, gripping its pumpkin-like face as dark blood spurted forth. \n\nFor a moment, it moved its hand, seeming to inspect the wound I’d left, a massive gash splitting it where a nose had once been, revealing what looked to me like dozens, maybe hundreds of interwoven tendrils, like so many worms in orgiastic movement. The rage I saw in its eyes reminded me I had no time to wait. I stumbled forth, doing my best to keep my bad leg stiff beneath me, unwilling to trip and die like in some cliche horror movie death. \n\nIt wailed from the window behind me, a sound like nothing I’ve ever heard, or will ever forget. I didn’t look back, my hands finding the keys in my pockets and clicking the lock button, the glow of my car's headlights feeling like salvation. \n\nI heard a crash, the final few chunks of glass surely, and I knew I had seconds. I limped around the hood of the car, pulling open the driver side door, and glancing up to see it only a few yards away, and gaining fast.\n\nI shrieked out, unable to help myself before jumping headlong into the car, quickly pulling the door shut behind me. The car shook as it jumped atop the hood. With the gash my kick had left, it appeared somehow even more inhuman than before, the face beneath its face a shifting, gurgling mass of teeth and flesh. \n\nIt hissed, spraying gray-black bile across the window. My hand hurried to the lock button, before I pushed the key into the ignition. My ankle screamed out in protest as I attempted to push the gas, forcing me to use my off leg. The car jerked back with a screech, but the creature held firm.\n\nMy eyes met the thing in the window, its own glistening with such hatred like I’ve never seen. Slowly it leaned in close, until its breath left fog on the window, and spoke, with a voice like Beatriz, and mine, and a dozen others.\n\n“*I’ll see - you again.*” \n\nWith that, it was gone, disappearing in a flash off into the surrounding woods. Panic, terror, and all of the awful things seemed to coarse through me. My stomach threatened vomit, and my body tremored with unspent energy, but it didn’t matter. I pulled out of that gravel driveway, and drove. \n\nDrove out of that neighborhood, away from that town, and all the way home, not stopping until I was in front of my house, and only then breaking down.\n\nAt some point I found my way into my house, and into bed, where I collapsed, and felt as though I slept for years.\n\nI never did tell my friends, or anyone for that matter, what happened that weekend. Who would believe me? Truth be told, I want to forget, and I’m hoping finally writing this all out will help.\n\nI’ve done the best I can on my own, but even weeks later, I find my mind running away with me.\n\nI saw Beatriz last week. On my way back from physical therapy for my leg. She was exiting the forest preserve a few blocks away from my house, an early morning jog or something I’m sure, and though it was only in passing, I could swear she saw me. She saw me and smiled.\n\nShe insists I’m mistaken, that she was in class around the time I saw her. Maybe I am, who knows anymore. All I know is my cabin trip days are behind me. \n\nAnd I’ve learned that no matter how right something looks, trust your gut. There are things that will smile at you with a friend's face, that mean you only harm.",

        "text": "I am from a small island nation where the economy is not too good nor too bad. Our education systems are free and if you are smart enough (or able to cramp gigabytes of information in your head) you may be able to get a chance at attending university. \n\nFree. \n\nAnd it's no joke. \n\nI was one of the lucky ones. I somehow got into do a degree (which I will not mention for personal reasons). Still, free university comes with a catch. You can't choose it. You get what they give you, even if it's on the other side of the island. It's a beggars can't be choosers policy. You get good marks of your A/L exams, you can choose where to go. Others, you can choose where you go to too, but your first choices will be ignored if your level is not upto standard for that particular university. \n\nFor me, I had to travel to the other corner of the country. The thing is, eventhough my country is small and tiny and no one probably never even heard of it, there are also of races and religions intermixed. Some places have more of one race than the other, where they speak a different language altogether.\n\nFor me and my parents, it was terrifying. My uni was in a different area, an eight our ride away from home, where the locals had a different culture and language altogether. \n\nStill, first years were given a mercy from universities. \n\nWe are given hostels. \n\nWhen I first learned of it, I expected a small cramped house with a dark room and paint peeling off the walls. There whould be one window with a creaking bed and washrooms that would either always dirty or smelly. But to my surprise, the hostels were great. It was a four person room, with bunk beds above and a table top with drawers below as a part of the bed (it was quite novel) and two good public washrooms per floor. The building was new, there was even a study area and facilities to order food. Even security was well thought through, with a guard in the bottom floor at the entrance and a twenty four hour warden available and residing in the building for safety. \n\nFor me, it was so much better than my expectations. And my roommates were great. We got together by accident, but we got along very well. \n\nThe thing was, eventhough our hostel was perfect, there were things that were quite disturbing. \n\nLike that one time where  a bunch girls were having a midnight surprise birthday party when they suddenly screamed. Everyone woke up, even the boys from the boy's hostel on the other side. \n\nThe girls said that they saw a hand creeping in from under the air vents below the window. \n\nThe party was held on the fourth floor. \n\nOur hostel had balconies facing the back. No one could imagine how anyone could climb four stories. And the land behind the hostel was just empty shrubland. And there were no footprints below, nor signs of anyone trying to climb up or down.\n\nAnother day, a girl in the second floor saw a humanoid silhouette behind the balcony door. The top half of the door was glass and there were two windows on either side of the door, which opened to the balcony. So it was possible to see of there was anything or anyone on the balcony. \n\nAnd so, rules had to be implemented. No one was allowed to keep the balcony doors open after dark. A security guard would always petrol the building after seven, flashing their torchlight at the open balcony doors. \n\nEveryone thought it was just a sick pervert who was desperate enough to climb into a girls' hostel. I couldn't imagine what the guy was even hoping to see.\n\nThe incidents were forgotten. They were just by some perverts. Nothing more. \n\nBut one day, we forgot to close the balcony door. \n\nWe always came back from campus all tired and sometimes, most of us fall asleep. But not everyone. Out of the four of us, at least one person stays awake. \n\nIt was different that day. \n\nEveryone fell asleep at about five in the evening, it was a long day of lectures and practicals. So no one was there to close the balcony door by seven. The rooms were hot during the day, and the only source of wind was from the balcony windows and doors, especially the door. So we kept it open till the guards yelled at us to close it.\n\nI, unfortunately, was a light sleeper. It was easy to wake me up. Something, maybe an instinct, woke me up that night. It was dark. It seems the lights were gone (it happens in our country). But I was drowsy and the ceiling fan was obviously not working so closing the door meant we would sweat till we dehydrate. \n\nAnd so I just laid there, the only source of light from the full moon outside. A cool breeze blew in. Everyone else was sleep. There wasn't a sound outside. It was probably ten at night. Or maybe eleven. \n\nI thought that maybe I should close the door. It was an open invitation to any perverts otherwise. \n\nThat was when I saw the shadow. I was lying to my side, my face somewhat facing the balcony. \n\nA shadow was climbing through a the left side of the balcony. First it was a long leg. Then a thin long arm. A head. A long neck. It crept slowly. So slow that there wasn't a sound. \n\nI held my breath. I laid on top of the bunk bed, maybe six feet off the floor, just staring as the creature finally stepped into the balcony. \n\nOur balcony. \n\nMy mind was cursing. I wanted to climb down the bed and just shut the door. But my limbs remained frozen. I was closer to the door. There were three other people with me. If anyone had a chance to knock whatever creature it was, it would be me. I was the tallest and the buffy one out of the four of us. \n\nBut something was telling me to keep still. Be pretend I was sleep. \n\nThe shadow simply stared inside. Not moving an inch. As if it was waiting. For something. I felt my heart beating painfully in my chest. It would have been reassuring if it looked human. I mean, it was humanoid, but it's limbs were too long and spindly, it was too tall for a normal person. For some reason, it didn't feel human. It didn't seem human\n\nAll of a sudden, the lights came. \n\nWe slept with the lights and the fan turned on.  So the moment the electricity started to work, the lights flickered into life, lighting the whole room. The shadow jumped down. The fan started to beat. \n\nI waited. I waited till my heart calmed down before I rushed down and closed the door. My stumbling woke up my roommates. I told them that we would get into trouble if anyone saw that the door was open. \n\nI never told anyone about what happened. I couldn't tell whether it was a dream, my imagination or my paranoia working tricks on me. But if what I saw was real, then whoever repaired the electricity grid sort of saved our lives, or my sanity. \n\nWe never left the door open after that. I made sure of it. We don't live in the hostel now. We had to find our own boarding in the third year. \n\nI still close and lock every door around. Whatever it is that lives here, whether human or paranormal, I didn't want to see it again. I am waiting to go back home after I get my degree. I just hope nothing like that happens again.",

        "text": "This is my Brother's story that I'm relaying. He's typically pretty straight edge and to the point (he is a cop after all) so I have no reason to call shenanigans on his story.\n\nHe's on the force in my hometown and was working the overnight shift (12-8 AM) when this occurred. At an ungodly hour (2-3?) they got a frantic call about a possible break in at someone's apartment.\n\n(Sidenote, this apartment is located directly above a dress shop near the middle of town and is the only apartment there. The dress shop is never open, it's always dark and the woman that owns it has to be in her 90s. If you need a bridesmaids dress from 1978 this is your spot)\n\nWhen my Brother and another officer arrived they realized there is no break in. It is a young single mother and her young daughter (5/6ish) and they are in hysterics. The Mom composed herself and explained that she woke up from a dead sleep to the sound of her daughter screaming bloody murder. She ran to the girl's bedroom, flipped on the lights and swears that she saw a black figure at the foot of the bed. It was only for a second before it sort of evaporated (think Thanos snapping his finger).\n\nThe daughter is traumatized and swearing up and down that someone was standing over her and staring at her. So the obvious conclusion is the kid is having a nightmare or scared but the mother is adamant that she's never done anything like this. She states that her daughter has bad dreams and gets scared all the time but usually just walks into the mom's room and crawls into bed with her so this behavior is above and beyond out of character. The Mother also reaffirms that she saw something in the room so it's difficult for her to dismiss it.\n\nShe provided a bit more backstory at this point. They have a cat and it's a super friendly, needs to constantly be cuddled cat. If they're on the couch the cat is on them. If the daughter is playing the cat is parked on her. The cat refuses to ever go anywhere near the daughter's room. If the daughter is carrying the cat (which she apparently always does) it will start flailing and spazzing out anytime she tries to bring her in the room. The cat could be playing with a toy and be in it's glory running around the house but if the toy bounced into the room it's gone.\n\nHer brother stayed at the apartment for a week earlier in the year for some cat sitting while they were on vacation. When she got back he said he'd never stay there again. Claimed the entire time he swore someone was in the room with him, like he was never alone. He said the cabinet doors would be open whenever he went into the kitchen, he chalked it up to the hinges going but she said she's never experienced anything like that.\n\nSo all pretty circumstantial stuff, they stay a bit and talk her down, the daughter falls asleep. They check everywhere in the apartment just to confirm there's nobody there. Eventually they leave and think that was weird.\n\nDuring shift change in the locker room they're telling the next crew about their weird call from the night before. During the tail end of the story one of the more senior cops comes in and says \"Oh are you talking about such and such address?\".\n\n\"Yeah how did you know?\"\n\n\"Officer so and so and I got a similar call there a few years back, guy swore that someone kept breaking into his place but nothing was ever taken\"\n\nFor whatever it's worth this apartment is directly across the street (no more than 30 feet) from a cemetery.",

In the corner of my dark room, two eyes and sharp, reflective teeth. It came closer and bit my leg clean off. The pain felt so real.\n\nI know I had a right foot. I know. But when I woke up, it was gone. There were crutches next to my bed, and everyone I know swears I've always been an amputee. I'm losing my mind, right? It was a dream - maybe I've always been an amputee?\n\nI flip through my phone, photo after photo. Leg gone, leg gone, leg gone.\nAm I crazy? Everything here shows it - I never had a right foot.

        "text": "Hello, I’m not sure why I’m posting this I guess I just needed to get this off my chest and I could use you guys advice , I’ve been a member of this subreddit for a long time and until recently I didn’t believe any of the stories on this sub reddit I just assumed everyone else thought it was fake as well and was just playing along but after recent events you could tell me you cat is actually a alien demon from mars and I would I would hear you out.\n\nI’m not good at telling stories but I’ll try and make this as easy to read as possible, so anyway I should probably get to talking about the hell portal in my garbage bag, which I still have though I doubt I’ll ever use it\nFor context I was fourteen at the time and it was the long holiday between when one year of school ended and another began and unlike the other three holidays my friends where off on vacation leaving me along with my mother for weeks on end, which is wear the previous mentioned trip to hell happened \n\nI first saw the portal in a dream after a heated argument with my mother where I said some things I wish I could take back, god the last thing I told my mom was to get out of my life, anyway one night I was sleeping in my bed and I had a dream that felt different \n\nI was fully lucid in my dream but I was knew I was dreaming I don’t know how I knew but I did, I think it was mostly little things that tipped me off, things in the wrong place extra and in that dream I don’t know why but I went into the trash and just stood there, I could’ve moved if I wanted to but I didn’t \n\nThe best way I can describe it is like when your really invested in a good tv show but have to leave the room to do something else and you linger in the doorway for a while, eventually I started to climb into the trash when my mom throw me away from it and something pulled her in\n\nI woke up the next morning believing it all to be just a very strange dream and went to my moms room to check on her and saw the bed empty, my heart started racing at this moment as I went to grave my phone and call her\n\nBut when I made it to the phone I found my moms right next to it, I panicked realising my mom wouldn’t have left the house without her phone so went out back to see if she was doing yard work\n\nIt was unlikely considering the time but at that point it seemed more likely then something dragging my mom into the trash can half her size\n\nBut sadly she wasn’t there so I ran to the trash can and dug through it and found nothing, I then went back to retrieve moms phone to find it gone it, this actually filled me with hope as I thought I must of imagined moms phone being home or she was on the toilet and had left to go shopping out the front door when I was out back\n\nMy hope quickly diminished when I called it only to hear the ringing coming from the kitchen, I won’t lie and say that I immediately jump into the trash can to fight whatever beast took my mom\n\nBut I do hope you people can understand me lying to myself that my mom was just shopping and she must have left without her phone which she must have dropped into the trash\n\nIt was about a day later when I texted everyone I knew if they had seen my mom and got the same story from everyone, none of them had seen her for the past few days, I told them about the fight we had and they called the authorities to go on a manhunt for my mom\n\nIt was no use of course I knew where my mom was, I wasn’t sure what was in the trash so I put on the thickest light weight durable clothes I had and grabbed a broom and added a knife to the end a idea I had come up with when planning for a zombie apocalypse \n\nI eat dinner which was all the food I had left just a miss match of random meat products that didn’t require cooking and two hotdogs with no buns, sorry to any vegans reading this\n\nAnyway after staling for a while I knew it was now or never as my grandparents where on their way to pick me up, the first thing i did was take the trash bag out of the can to figure out how the portal worked, after I figured out the portal was in the bag I put my makeshift weapon in and it went in all the way before touching a solid surface \n\nI then poked the stick around to see how big whatever solid ground was down there to make sure I could stand there, then I pulled the broom out and felt it, the part of it that had been inside the portal was hot and had some dust or something on it\n\nI walked out to go grab some goggles and a Halloween mask to cover my face, it I sat  down next to the bag and threw my legs in lowering my shelf till I could touch the ground with just my head poking out\n\nI took a deep breath and pulled my head down into the portal and felt the dust like stuff hit my uncovered ears and it you’ve ever burned plastic then you know the feeling of tiny hit particles hitting you face and going down you lungs\n\nAfter I had grown accustomed to the feeling I looked around and there’s no easy way of saying this but I was in hell, red hot rocks, fire and the distinct smell of something burning\n\nI quickly realised that I could reach the portal and pull myself up quickly if I had to which as you will see I had to, after a few seconds I looked down from the platform I was perched on to see a tunnel with what I can only guess are imps, I’m not too familiar with demon lore and stuff most of what I know is from doom and hellava boss and other post on this subreddit\n\nThey were a little smaller then me and had horns and a tale and looked like a mix between the imps from doom and their more cartoony interpretations \n\nAfter my eyes adjusted so I could see better I saw what I now know as a succubous (I’m not sure how to spell it but don’t google it unless you want to see more rule 34 then the chica has) but anyway what you need to know is this demon looked like the most beautiful girl I could imagine and as a hormonal teenager I tried to move closer to get a better look but when I did I saw what she was  nibbling on and swore out loud\n\nShe was eating some poor basted’s private parts and my swearing at normal speaking volume was enough to get all the demons down there’s attention, I almost immediately jumped up and out of the portal landing hard on the tiled kitchen floor\n\nI sighed a breath of relief but the things weren’t done with as the sucubis grabbed my leg and began pulling my back, a friend of mine who’s mom was a religious nut saw me and thanks to her and her obsession with the Annabelle franchise I’m able to post this\n\nMe and her then closed the trash bag and tired it shut with her necklace that had the cross on it, I thought about throwing the back into the garbage bin but leaving a unattended portal to hell didn’t sit right with me\n\nAfter a short stay with my grandparents I moved in to my one of my friends house and brought the trash with me him being a huge believer in the paranormal didn’t question it\n\nMe and a couple friends are planning on opening it up again and going in crosses and holy water guns blazing to retrieve my moms remains, if anyone knows anything that could help us while we’re their now’s they time to speak up",

        "text": "Yeah, pretty messed up right? This might be the only place people will believe what has happened to me and my sister.\n\nMy name is Connor and I'm 16 years old, I haven't seen my little sister Carly (13) in 3 months. \n\nIt all started on a Friday night, my sister was due to go off to summer camp for 6 weeks the next day. She seemed really excited and would be smug with me, as I was working for my summer. I mean I didn't mind, I was just thinking about all the cash I would make. I never really liked going to camp anyway. My parents were going to leave early in the morning to drop her off. I had decided that I would have one last bit of fun before she went. I was going to sneak into her room, hide in her closet, and jump out on her when she came in. \n\nIt was late maybe about 10:30, she was in the study with Mom and Dad, packing the last few things. I had gone to bed earlier stating that I was sick, of course Carly stayed well away from me. She didn't want anything ruining the start of camp. I made it look like I was in bed, with a combination of pillows and an old Halloween mask with a similar hair colour to mine. If anyone checked, it would look as if I was asleep.\n\nI crept across the hall over to my sisters room, I left the room in darkness as I placed myself into her closet and shut the door. A smile brandished across my face as I thought how brilliant this would be. It had become a game on how much we could scare each other over the years. I thought that this was going to be perfect, the best one yet! \n\nAfter around 5 minutes I heard her say goodnight to our parents and make her way up the stairs. She strutted into the room, you could see the excitement in her movements. She then stopped, I thought she had noticed me. She couldn't have, I didn't make a sound and I could only see her through the wooden panelled door. Her expression changed in an instant to an emotionless stare, her arms now by her side. She walked slowly to the middle of the room, she slowly laid her back on the floor. \n\nI was just about to jump out when I heard what sounded like floorboards creaking from the corner of the room. I couldn't see anything, my view was restricted but the room now felt bitterly cold and silent. I saw a tall humanoid figure emerge from the darkness. It was a deep red color with visible muscles and veins, as if it was a result of someone being skinned alive. It glided over to Carly, it's long arms with elongated fingers swayed nearly brushing the floor. It's large flat feet each equipped with four talons stopped behind her head. It crouched down, I could see it's terrifying face. It's sharp eyes almost looked like that of a lizard, it's nose was nothing more than a small mound with two large holes. \n\nCarly was frozen solid as it opened its mouth exposing what looked like hundreds of razor sharp teeth. I was in shock, covering my mouth with my hand trying to mask my now irregular breathing. My heart pounding against my chest, it felt so loud I was sure it would hear.  It's jaw seemed to dislocate itself like that of a snake as it smothered its mouth over my sweet sisters head. I should have done something, should have attacked it, but my body was stiff. I couldn't move even if I wanted to with my back pressed against the icy wall. This thing was now up to the top of her torso, I closed my eyes as tears ran down my face. This, was the last thing I remember. I must have blacked out or something. \n\nI woke the next morning, a crumpled mess at the bottom of the closet. My eyes stuck together with the tears of last night. I slowly opened the closet door as I was shrouded in sunlight. The room was empty only a few clumps of my sisters hair where she was laying remained. I went into my room, my decoy still in the same position as where I had placed it in my bed. I wearily walked downstairs calling out for my mom and dad, I was answered only by my own echo. I got my cell out of my pocket, only 5% battery. I called each of them one after another, nothing. \n\nI was still a mess after what I had witnessed last night, that thing, was on a loop in my mind. I went back into my room and spent the next hours calling my parents. 3 hours later my cell began ringing, I nearly jumped off my bed it scared me that much. \nIt was my mom, I said “where are you?! You need to come home now!”. \nShe said back, now concerned “what's the matter? We have just dropped off your sister”. \nMy face now drained of blood, “she, she's alive?”. \nMy mom came back confused “Of course darling, what do you mean?”\nI responded in disbelief “Nothing, I'll speak to you when you get home”\n“Ok honey, bye”. The line went dead.\nI sunk my head into my hands.\n\nAn hour later I heard the door open, my parents were back, I ran up to them I blurted in a frenzy “How was Carly, is she OK?!” My dad said she was fine. I then proceeded to tell them both what I saw last night. They both looked at me like I was crazy, like I was sadistic. I tried, so hard to tell them it wasn’t my imagination. I showed them the decoy, the hair in the floor, the closet I was in. My plea's only met by anger and  the words “Don't make such horrible things up boy” by my dad. I was getting barely a couple of hours sleep in the weeks after. The job at my uncles store my only escape from the flashbacks of that night. \n\nTwo and a half months have now passed and Carly was due to come home 3 weeks ago, when I asked my parents why they hadn’t gone to get her yet. They just said to me that she met a friend at camp and was staying with her for a couple of weeks. I have been trying to call her cell constantly, her voicemail now full. School starts next week, she was supposed to be home from her friends two days ago. My parents have been  trying to get me to go to see a psychiatrist as I won't stop saying what I saw. I have been refusing stating that they are lying to me. \n\nThey don't seem concerned at all, I constantly ask them when she is home. All they reply with is “in a few days”. \n\nI know what I saw, it happened, right in front of my eyes. I now have the horrible feeling that I will never see my sister again",

        "text": "I am 49 years old, 50 in only a couple of months. Too old to be frightened of the stories my grandmother told me during the long winter nights, when my parents were visiting their friends and it was just two of us sitting in front of the fire.  I shouldn’t even remember them. And yet, I still avert my gaze from the bathroom mirror if I happen to be there between midnight and three o’clock in the morning.  I’ve heard people refer to those hours as the witching hours. My grandmother never called them that or any other name. When I asked her “Why shouldn’t I look in the mirror at that time of night?”, she just shrugged her shoulders and simply said: “Because they look back. And once they see you…”.  \nShe left the rest of the sentence hanging there, unfinished, unspoken, in the space between us. She didn’t need to say it, we both knew what she was speaking off. \nLike I said, I am too old to be thinking about silly stories told by an elderly woman to entertain and, in equal measure frighten, a gullible child. It’s not her stories that stop me looking in the mirror in the middle of the night. For that, I have stories of my own.\nThere is a basement under my father’s house, as large as the whole footprint of the ground floor. There is no way to access it from the house itself. For that I would have to go out of our front door, turn right at the corner of the house and then descend the steep concrete steps, eleven of them, to the gloomy space under our home. I hated that basement. It was dark and cold and smelled funny. Worst of all that’s where She was. An old woman who lived in that basement. No, not lived, as she wasn’t a living creature, yet she occupied that space as fully and as easily as she occupied and terrorised my childhood. The memory of her goes all the way back to my earliest recollections, she was always there, lurking… waiting… \nShe was my first. In the beginning it was just this unsettling presence that was concentrated at the bottom right corner of the basement. The space there appeared slightly darker compared to the rest of the room, like the light itself struggled to penetrate it all the way through. Over the next few weeks it seems to grow bigger, spreading further into the room, claiming more of the space for itself. It felt fuller, heavier, gaining mass and a shape, until I was able to see her in the corner of my eye. You all know what I am talking about; that moment when you brain says: “Wait, what was that?!” and your eyes are trying to focus on the fast, blurry image that flashed by, just at the periphery of your vision. \nAt first, my primal fear seems to satisfy her. I would sense her menacing presence and would immediately break into tears. I would call out to my mother or my father and tried to explain what I saw. I would beg them not to ask me to go down there! Nobody believed me, of course. “You are just a scared child with vivid imagination” they would say. But as I grew, so did her need for my terror. She wasn’t there all the time. Sometimes, there would be a month that passed by, possibly even longer, just long enough for me to stop looking over my shoulder and start hoping that it was over. Maybe I imagined it all… Then the torment would start all over again, stronger than before. Few of these incidents were particularly terrifying, and even after all these years I still remember the details with crystal clarity. \n\nOne summer evening, I could not have been older then 10, I walked up the few stairs leading to my parents’ front door, I opened the door and entered the long hallway that led to the living room. I remember that it was unusually bright moon that evening, I could see clearly the entire hallway, so I didn’t bother to switch the light on. It has been a while since I saw her last, so she wasn’t at the forefront of my mind. As I approached the living room door the sense of dread suddenly washed over me, my skin breaking into goosebumps and cold, tingly electric shock run down my spine.  I could feel her before I had a chance to see her and as I looked up, I saw her pale face looming right above me! This was the first time that I saw her so clearly. That night her face was permanently etched into my brain. I can see it now; her skin had a yellowish, waxy shine to it and her face was lined with deep creases. I could plainly see the droopy folds above and under her pale, grey eyes. Her hair was shoulder length, black but heavily peppered with grey hairs, uncombed and unruly. She was smiling; no, not smiling, more like grinning at me. Something just wasn’t right about it. Her lips were thin, stretched over her gums and exposing too many teeth. The worst of all was yet to come as that wide grin stretched wider, impossibly wide, and the high-pitched scream filled my ears and my head.    \nI run outside as fast as my ten-year-old legs would carry me. I remember willing them on to move as they felt wooden and so very, very heavy.  I could hear my parents and their friends gathered around the barbecue at the very bottom of the garden, happily chattering away, completely oblivious to the horror I was living through at that very moment. I sprinted towards them. I almost made it too. I was just about to round the corner of the house when she was right in front of me again with that horrible scream coming out of that wide gap on her face that shook every nerve in my body. I tripped and fell onto the sharp corner brick of the house, cutting a deep gash into my chin. By the time I reached my parents front of my t-shirt was soaked in blood. I ended up with three stitches in my chin and all these years later that scar is still visible and permanent reminder of Her.  \nAfter that the game was on. She would come and go as she pleased. She was no longer constrained just to the basement, she was free to roam the house and torment me. The only other member of the family that would catch at least a glance of her was my grandmother. I, however, seemed to be her favourite toy. My terror fed her. \nMy bedroom was at the far end of the house, I liked it there, the distance from the other bedrooms in the house offered a much needed privacy from the rest of the family as it hid my nocturnal screams and sobs to some degree. My bed was pushed against the wall, lengthwise, under the large window. That left three sides of it open. On the nights she would come, she would start pacing at the top of the bed, then down the full length of it until she finally stopped at my feet. And then back up again. Her steps would be slow and deliberate. Now and then she would pause in her pacing, and I would strain my young ears, hiding under the bed covers, trying to figure out has she finally left me in peace for the night. More often than not, the pacing resumed shortly after with increased intensity and the taunting continued like the previous, countless nights. Now and then, she would yank on my hair that was protruding out from under the duvet, and I would scream and scream. My parents were at the end of their patience with my night shenanigans, as they put it. Maybe I needed professional help, after all, aren’t I too old to be crying at night?! I learned to bite down on the pillow and smother the screams on the nights that she was in particularly vicious and playful mood. She would keep me awake night after night, periodically pacing, whispering or screaming in my ears. And the life went on.    \nTwo days before I left my parents’ house, she made sure to send me off with a parting gift. I was 18 years old, and I haven’t seen her for a long time, at least a year. I finally grew out of my imagination, or so I told myself. That night I went to sleep and few hours later something woke me up. I sat up in bed and listened to the quiet groans and noises that all old houses make, but apart from those familiar sounds all was quiet. I laid back down, covered my head with the duvet and was ready to go back to sleep, when suddenly, the loud scream bounced inside my head. It did not come through my ears, this horrifying scream just stuffed my brain, so fully and completely that there was no room left for a single, coherent thought!  Then something pulled my hair, so hard that I felt my scalp lifting off my skull. The bedcovers were yanked off me in one sleek motion. The room was icily cold. I jumped and threw myself at the direction of the light switch, but where once was an empty space between me and the wall with the light switch on, was now occupied by Her. I wasn’t a child anymore, I was tall enough that my eyes were on the level with hers. I saw her hooded grey eyes staring at me, the pure malice shining in them, and then I heard the familiar scream wailing out of that wide grinning mouth. I felt her bony fingers closing around my wrists, squeezing harder and harder. Somehow I managed to rip myself away from her grip and hit the light switch, and her face vanished with the bright light filling the room. But I could still hear the screams, it took me a minute to realise that I was the one screaming. \nI cannot describe to you the sense of relief I had when I left my parents’ home. I was tired of her, and I was tired of doubting my own sanity because of her.\nI never saw her again. I was away from a family home for couple of years and when I came back, she was gone. Maybe she moved on looking for another child to terrorise or maybe my absence starved her of pure fear she fed on and was forced to return to the hell she crawled out of. I don’t know and I don’t want to know. I was ready to write her off as a figment of an overactive, childish imagination that lingered around for way too long, until my grandmother said to me: “My poor child, none of my other children see them. I though it stopped with me, but it didn’t. It just skipped a generation.” \nLike I said at the beginning of this story, she was my first. Many, many followed. Most of them were just lost and searching for their loved ones, some completely unaware that they are dead, some trapped here by their own pain. Few were like her, feeding of the fear of the living. But that is a story for another time. Something more important is on my mind. I have three children now, two sons and a daughter. I was hoping that it stopped with me, or maybe they were lucky and it skipped a generation…\n When my middle son was around 6 years old, roughly the same age I was when I saw Her for the first time, he started waking up screaming in the night. \n“It’s just night terrors honey”, I would tell him while hugging his trembling little body close to me, “it’s a bad dream, that is all. Mama is here, don’t be afraid. Can you tell me what you saw?” \n“I saw a little boy mama” he said, “and he asked me to swap lives with him. His life for mine.” \nThe only thing I could tell him throughout his childhood was this: \n“Just remember, do NOT look in the mirror after midnight and before 3 o’clock in the morning. Some call them witching hours. I don’t have a name for them. I just know that’s the time they look back. And once they see you… “",

I couldn't believe it, she was my everything, my world, and I couldn't imagine life without her. I felt hopeless and helpless as I watched her suffer, and I would have done anything to save her.\n\nI turned to every possible treatment, but nothing seemed to work. I was at my wits end, watching my wife slip away before my eyes. I was desperate, and that was when I heard a voice, a whisper in my ear. It said, \"You can save your wife, I can help you, but it will come with a price.\"\n\nAt first, I was skeptical. I didn't believe in any sort of supernatural being. But as Sarah's condition worsened, I began to consider the offer more seriously. I knew that making a deal with this thing would be a risky gamble, but I was willing to do whatever it takes to save my wife. So, I asked \"What do you want in return?\"\n\nThe thing replied \"All I want is a small favor, nothing too difficult, nothing that will harm you or your loved ones, just a small favor.\"\n\nI agreed to the bargain, and the next morning, I woke up to find that Sarah's condition had miraculously improved. Her cancer was in remission, and she was on the road to recovery. I was overjoyed and grateful, but as the days went by, I began to notice strange occurrences happening around me.\n\nI heard whispers in the dark, shadows moving when there was no one there, and strange symbols appearing on my skin.

I was wracked with guilt and regret, knowing that I had doomed myself and my family for the sake of a false hope.\n\nAs the days passed, Sarah's health worsened again, and the thing's presence grew stronger. I felt like I was being watched, and I knew that the thing was waiting for me to slip up, to break the deal.

        "text": "Emma, Leah, Max and I had always been the closest of pals. We shared laughs and adventures in our tiny village. We spent our day exploring the nearby woods and fields, gathering wildflowers for our mothers and playing games that only children can understand. We would climb trees, build forts from branches and logs, and collect colorful stones from the creek. When it was too cold or rainy to go outside, we’d stay in one of our homes and play board games or tell stories around a crackling fire.\n\nOur parents were always supportive of our adventures, though they often worried about us getting into trouble. They’d call us in when it started to get dark, but sometimes we wouldn’t come home until late at night with mud on our shoes and twigs in our hair. We never minded being scolded by them because we knew deep down that they were proud of us.\n\nIn the summertime, we’d go swimming in the lake near town or catch fireflies on warm evenings. We had so much fun together that time seemed to stand still – it felt like each moment lasted forever. On especially hot days, we’d set up a lemonade stand near the village square to raise money for ice cream cones afterwards.\n\nOn Sundays, after church services ended, we’d all gather at Emma’s house for lunch and then spend lazy afternoons playing tag or hide-and-seek until it was time to go home again. Evenings meant roasting marshmallows over an open fire as we watched shooting stars streak across the night sky above us.\n\nIt was a magical childhood filled with love and friendship.\n\nOur little village was a special place, with its cobblestone streets, old-fashioned buildings and the scent of freshly baked bread wafting through the air. We were blessed to have grown up in such an idyllic setting.\n\nThe people of our village were just as special as the place itself. Everyone knew each other and looked out for one another. Neighbors would often stop to chat in the street, or help each other with tasks like shovelling snow or chopping wood. They’d offer kind words of encouragement and support when times got tough, and we all felt their warmth and generosity.\n\nOn Saturdays during the summer, the townspeople would gather for a picnic on the village green, bringing homemade dishes to share. We’d eat together under a canopy of trees while listening to fiddle music from local musicians. Afterwards, children would run around playing games while adults chatted until it was time to go home again.\n\nThese are the memories I cherish most about growing up in our small town – the friendship and kindness that surrounded us every day made it feel like home.\n\nEverything was magical and beautiful until that man came to our town back in the summer of 2008.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFirst of all, our town is pretty boring but we have some occasional events. Every summer, we had a carnival with rides, games, and food stands. There were also occasional circuses that came to town, complete with clowns, acrobats and colorful tents. On special occasions like holidays or important anniversaries, people from all over the county would come to watch fireworks displays in the village square.\n\nEvery autumn, there was an apple festival where local farmers brought in baskets of fruit for sale and we could sample freshly made cider while listening to live music. During the winter months, ice skating shows took place on frozen ponds while sleigh rides wound through the countryside.\n\nIn springtime, art exhibits popped up around town displaying works by local artists – it was always exciting to see what new pieces they had created! We’d also have theater performances at the community center showcasing plays written by our own villagers. And of course there were parades galore throughout the year celebrating different milestones or achievements within our town.\n\nThese occasions were always a wonderful part of growing up in our small village – they brought us together as a community and gave us something to look forward to during each season.\n\nThat summer, something completely unusual happened. A man referred to as The Stone Master, whose true identity remained a mystery, built elaborate castles and sculptures out of stones in the country.\n\nThe long description of the brochure I was holding contained the following information:\n\n\"Attention all art lovers! After Nevada, a stunning stone castle with intricate sculptures is coming to your town in just a few days. Witness the incredible skill and craftsmanship of The Stone Master as he builds this magnificent structure in just three days! Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see as Gargoyle Grove, his beautiful creation comes to life before your very eyes. Mark your calendars and make sure to visit us at \\[location - I would rather not share it\\] from May 25 2008 to see the castle in all its glory. See you there!\"\n\nI found it hard to accept that the whole stone castle with all the intricate sculptures would be built in just three days. Such a task seemed impossible.\n\nMax spread open the brochure on the sidewalk and his eyes lit up with excitement. “Look at these photos! Can you believe it?\n\n\"We have to go,\" he said as his finger trailed over the image of a castle made out of stone on an area of 1500 square meters.\n\nI peered over his shoulder, disbelief painted across my face. “We can go, but that's impossible. There's no way someone can build that,” I said, sceptically.\n\nEmma and Leah leaned in, listening intently as we discussed our plan - to see the arrival of the Stone Master the next day. We couldn't wait to see Gargoyle Grove!  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next day, we arrived at the site of the exhibit early in the morning. Our town provided the sculptor with a temporary area where he could build up his castle. It was actually a rocky area near town. The place was littered with large stones and boulders, ranging in size from pebbles to boulders the size of cars. The terrain was uneven and rugged, with sharp ridges or loose pebbles in some places. The colors varied from earthy browns to deep reds and grays. There were pockets of trees and shrubs scattered throughout the area, providing a stark contrast to the surrounding rocky environment. The area was barren and desolate, the only sound was a faint whisper of wind.\n\nAs we approached the place, we noticed a small group of people gathered around a large truck with a tarp covering its contents.\n\nThen, as if on cue, the man himself emerged from the crowd and stepped up onto the platform in front of us. He was tall and broad-shouldered with an air of confidence about him. His eyes were sharp and his hands were calloused from years of hard work carving stone. He held out his hands to us, beckoning us closer, and we all moved forward eagerly to get a better look at him.\n\nThe Stone Master then proceeded to unload his supplies from the truck - various stones and tools for sculpting them into works of art.\n\nMax stared in disbelief at the pile of huge stones that the master was unloading from his truck.\n\n\"So...you are planning to build up a whole stone castle in three days by carving out these huge rocks?\" He asked skeptically.\n\n\"That is right, boy!\" The master replied, his voice deep and mellow.\n\n\"How will you do that?\" Max demanded, his curiosity piqued.\n\n\"That is something that you will not see,\" The man replied, throwing a thick tarpaulin over the stones with one quick movement.  \n\"What do you mean?\" Max asked, and the master gave an enigmatic smile. \"Whenever I go to a place, I am always covered by these huge tarps during the night, so nobody can see me how I work.\"  \nMeanwhile, huge black tarps were being pulled up all over the area so nobody could see what was going on behind them. Even the local journalists were not allowed to film behind those tarps.\n\nMax raised his eyebrows sceptically. “Really? And what if someone manages to take a peek?”\n\nThe man's expression grew stern and he leaned forward. “I strongly warn anyone who even thinks of doing such a thing not to try it.” His menacing and deep voice rumbled through the air.\n\nI don't know why but at that moment, terror filled the air as we stared at the man. Our hearts beat faster, and I could feel sweat on my palms. My voice quivered as I spoke, “Okay guys, let's get out of here. See you in three days then, Mr Stone Master!” I took my friends by the hands and pulled them towards the road, not daring to look back.  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning, the sun rose over the horizon, and with it came a feeling of mystery and anticipation. We all gathered around the area again, wondering what was happening behind those black tarps. We anticipated cranes or heavy machinery of some kind, but none were present.\n\nThe crowd of onlookers became increasingly impressed as they watched the event, however there was nothing to see.\n\nAfter an hour, he addressed the curious crowd and said,\n\n'Ladies and Gentleman, I'm giving you a taste of my work!'\n\nSuddenly, a loud noise made us all jump. We looked up to see the tarps being removed and the Stone Master standing in front of us with a proud look on his face.  \nWe all gasped in awe as we saw what he had created overnight - an intricately carved stone castle that was breathtakingly beautiful! He had worked with incredible skill and precision, creating delicate designs and patterns all over the walls. However, the castle was not complete yet.\n\nThe castle still had several unfinished features, such as incomplete turrets, missing staircases, and large bare patches on the walls that have yet to be filled in with intricate carvings. Some towers were jutted outwards and gaps in the masonry. The carved designs were also incomplete, and the ground around the castle was still scattered with pieces of rubble and broken stones. Many of the sculptures remained unfinished and without details, with some having only basic outlines and shapes. The surfaces of these sculptures were left rough and jagged, with uneven edges and inconsistencies. Pieces of the stone were be broken off or missing entirely, evidence of their incomplete state. Despite this, the beauty of the structure is still evident and serves as a testament to the Stone Master's skill.\n\nSome onlookers even offered to help when the man but he politely declined their offers, insisting that he wanted to finish this project alone - a testament to his years of hard work and dedication but we did not believe it.\n\nHe was keeping something secret while the urge to know what it was kept growing stronger.\n\nMax couldn't take it anymore, his face contorting with determination. He turned to us, his voice pleading like a desperate plea for mercy.\n\n'I can't bear not knowing what he's up to! We have to sneak into his place tonight!'\n\nAs Max's eyes scanned their faces, the girls began to nod, eyes twinkling with excitement. Cheers of agreement and enthusiasm filled the air.\n\nI stood rooted to the ground, mesmerized by the intricate architecture of the castle but too scared to come any closer. I just wanted to stay and simply admire the beauty of the castle from afar when it would be finished.\n\n'It's too risky!' I said, trying to talk them out of it. We don't know what we're getting into.'\n\nMax's voice was loud, insistent, and almost comeading as he spoke to me. He held his hands on his hips and leaned in close, as if daring me to join them.\n\n'Oh come on Mark, don't be such a pussy! We should all go together to explore it!'\n\n'No, I don't want to go. I have bad feelings about it.' I stepped back, shaking my head.\n\nMax straightened up and set his jaw.\n\n'Fine. Then we go without you. Tonight. If you changed your mind, you can call me until 10.'\n\nHis words echoed like a challenge in the stillness.\n\nAs they left, I watched them with a heavy heart; part of me wanted to join them on their adventure but a bigger part of me knew that it was too dangerous for us to take such risks.  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt had been all evening that I had been struggling with indecision as to whether I should call Max or not. Half of me wanted to go while the other half wanted to stay. My curiosity about the unknown man was consuming me. I sit in my room in silence, mulling over the mysterious man and his project. Who was he? Where did he come from? How did he learn such an intricate craft? What was the purpose of this castle and what secrets were hidden within its walls?\n\nNeedless to say that I was so excited that I could not sleep that night. I was tempted a to call them a few times but I did not want to get them in trouble in case their phones were not muted.\n\nInstead, I just sent them an SMS message:\n\n*So? What's up? Did you go? On pins and needles! :D*\n\nAnd then I waited. And waited. But eventually, I dozed off.\n\nThe following morning, as soon as I awoke, I grabbed my phone and glanced at the time. It was 8 o'clock, so I knew that it was too early to reach out to any of my pals. Nevertheless, I couldn't contain my enthusiasm and I made the call anyway. What's the worst that could happen? I'd only wake them up from their slumber, so what?\n\nI called Max first.\n\n*The person you have called is currently unavailable.*\n\nWell, he must have been sleeping, I supposed. Then I called Leah.\n\n*The person you have called is currently unavailable.*\n\nThat was a bit odd, but I till had Emma to call.\n\nThe same message.\n\nNow that was more than odd. Or was that possible that they were all sleeping? Did I just overreact? I decided to wait.\n\nI spent the day waiting for their call, but nothing.\n\nThe metallic trill of the telephone echoed through the house just before noon and I tensed, recognizing the distinct sound of my mum's voice. I waited with bated breath, hoping against hope that it was not the call I was expecting. Then I heard it—the one name that sent chills down my spine: Ann, Max’s mother.\n\nShe called up to me from the first floor.\n\n'Nope, not at all.'\n\n'Do you have any idea where they might be?'\n\n'No, I didn't.' I said.\n\nI descended the stairs to the kitchen, where I found my mother washing dishes. With a concerned expression on her face, she told me, 'Max is missing and his mother is worried.' Later, when Leah and Emma's mothers called us, we heard the same worried tone in their messages.\n\nAt that moment I decided that I needed to take matters into my own hands. I was not going to just sit around and wait for them to come back; I was going to march up to the mysterious man's castle, disregarding my own safety, and find out more about his project.  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I arrived at the exhibit, two security men were blocking my way.\n\nI rushed to the entrance of the castle, hopeful to find my friends. I approached a burly guard standing behind an iron gate, his intimidating stance blocking my way, the tarp was pulled up.\n\n'I am looking for my friends!' I said.\n\n'No one is allowed inside the castle. I suggest you turn back and return home. Come back, when the master's work is complete.' the guard said, shaking his head, denying my request.\n\n'Please, sir. I need to find my friends. They've been missing for days and I believe they may be inside the castle. Can you please let me in?' I begged, my voice was shaking with worry.\n\n'I'm sorry, but I cannot allow it. The castle is off-limits to outsiders while the master is working on it.' the guard said.\n\n'I understand that, but I promise I won't cause any trouble. I just need answers about my friends. Please, let me in.'\n\n'I'm sorry, but I cannot. No one is allowed to enter the castle.'\n\nThe guard's words left me stunned and heartbroken. I had no choice but to turn back and leave without any answers or clues about my friends. As I walked away, I looked up at the castle one last time, wondering what secrets lay behind its walls and why the mysterious man was so determined to keep everyone out.\n\nAs I began to walk away, I was startled by a deep voice calling out to me. I spun around to see a man holding a chisel and a hammer, his face hidden by the shadows of an orange tarp. His figure was framed by an enormous stone wall behind him, and he declared sternly, “Your friends haven't been here!”\n\nI warily took steps towards him, asking skeptically, “Are you sure?” He nodded slowly and replied, “I've posted security guards to make sure no one comes in while I'm working. Even if your friends wanted to enter, they would not be able to.”\n\nHe could read the disbelief on my face and offered with a gruffness that belied his kindness,\n\n“Come in and check yourself!” He stepped aside and swept the tarp aside, revealing a narrow entranceway.\n\n'Be careful on your way inside.' he said with a gruffness that belied his kindness.  \n\n\nThe castle stood tall and imposing, its walls were made of grey stone that had yet to be finished. The entrance was guarded by two huge gargoyles. Their long, sharp claws looked like they could come to life at any moment, ready to strike. They had fierce and scowling faces that seemed to stare down on me Their wings were spread wide, showing an intimidating presence.  \nInside in the dim light, serpents and other carved figures seemed to come alive, their eyes were staring at me as I passed by. The air was thick with dust from the chisels and hammers of the sculptor working on the unfinished statues and walls, their faces hidden in the shadows of their black tarps.\n\n'See, there is nobody here,' the sculptor said behind me and encouraged me to take walk inside inside.\n\nThere was a labyrinth made from wall and I just could not believe one man was capable of building it up in two nights. What kind of black magic was present there, I wondered.\n\nThe atmosphere around the sculptures was tense, filled with a sense of dread.\n\nAs I was walking among the walls, the sculptures were imposing and intimidating. They had sharp claws, sharp teeth, and beady eyes that seemed to follow me as I was moving around. The figures were grotesque and menacing, with claws and fangs bared as if poised to strike. Some had wings, with feathers and scales that gave them an even more threatening form.\n\nHowever some of them were still unfinished, most of them were were grotesque and disfigured, depicting demons and monsters with sharp claws and fangs. I felt them real and alive and I just could not wait to get the hell out of there.\n\nBesides these strange feelings, I found nothing out of the ordinary inside the castle, so I decided to say goodbye and thanked the sculptor for his help.\n\n\"No problem.\" - he answered.\n\nI walked back outside, feeling relieved that I had not found any sign of my friends in the castle. As I walked away from the castle, I glanced back one last time at its imposing walls and mysterious sculptures, wondering if there was any truth to what the sculptor said about keeping outsiders away while he worked on it. With a heavy heart, I made my way down the path and left this place behind me.  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was tempted to go to the police but I decided against it. After all, if my friends were not there, then nothing would be gained from involving them in this mystery. I just hoped that wherever they were, they were safe and sound.\n\nSo I made my way to Max's place, hoping that he would be there. As I arrived at the door, I knocked and waited for an answer. It was opened almost immediately by his mother whose face was drawn and pale.\n\n'Mark? Come inside!'\n\nI went inside and she gestured to a seat in the living room where I could see that the his father was also in worry and discussion.\n\n'Max had left two nights prior and hadn't been heard from since. Have you seen him?' - she asked.\n\nThe tense atmosphere made the time seem to stretch in a way that felt unending.\n\nI filled her in on the plan my friends had cooked up—entering the castle at night to carry out some kind of plan.\n\nMrs Baker's face was red and her voice was tight. She leaned forward, her hands clenching the edge of the kitchen counter. \"'Why didn't you tell me this earlier?\" Her eyes searched my face, waiting for an answer. I looked down, feeling my cheeks flush with shame.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mrs Baker,\" I stammered, my throat dry with fear. \"I wasn't sure...\"\n\nBut she did wait for my answer. Instead, she immediately made calls to Leah and Emma's parents, and soon enough the sheriff caught wind of it.\n\nAt the same time, I felt guilty for not being there for them, for not being able to protect them from whatever danger may have befallen them. I should have never left my friends alone.  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe same afternoon, the sheriff approached me at home and began to ask questions.\n\nWe were huddled together in the living room, the air filled with an uncomfortable tension. My parents sat on either end of the couch, eyes darting back and forth as if expecting something sinister to appear.\n\n'Tell the truth, Mark!' my father encouraged me.\n\nThe sheriff, Luke Grant was tall and broad-shouldered with a stern expression on his face. His presence was intimidating but I answered his questions truthfully, telling him everything that I knew about the situation. I told him about our first visit to the Stone Master, our weird conversation with him and my friend's plans. However, I did not have any proof that they had gone there or Max was just showing off in front of the girls because I did not talk to them afterwards.\n\nHe listened intently as I described what had happened, scribbling down notes in a small pad he had brought with him. When I finished my story, he looked up at me with piercing brown eyes and said:\n\n'Well, boy. I dispatched a special team to the castle with a drone, which gave us a bird's-eye view of the entirety of the stone structure. But, unfortunately, no signs of your friends were seen. The sculptor even allowed my officers to search his truck, yet still there was no sign of them.' His voice trailed off and he slumped back in his chair in defeat.\n\n'Really?' I said, my confusion clear in my voice.\n\nI knew about a police investigation but I was too scared of going back to the place even with the police team because I was not sure what he might do to me if I showed my face there. I betrayed him and I didn't want to risk facing him again. In the end, I had to consider that I may have been completely wrong and my friends could have gone somewhere else instead. I might have accused that man wrongly.\n\nThe sheriff adjusted his hat, lifting one hand to wipe the sweat from his brow as he continued.\n\n'So we began to investigate other potential places where Max, Emma and Leah could have gone. We interviewed people from the area, asking questions about anyone who had seen anything that might lead them their whereabouts. We followed up on any leads we got, but still we came up empty-handed. My men even searched the nearby forests and abandoned buildings, hoping that someone could provide a clue as to where they had gone. Unfortunately, all of our efforts were fruitless.' - the sheriff said and sighed heavily.\n\nHe seemed to have lost all his hope, yet still had some strength in him to keep looking for it.\n\nAs the time passed, I grew increasingly guilt-ridden. I had been the one present when they were discussing going to the stupid castle and now they were missing. My mind was filled with questions and doubts as I replayed our conversation in my head. What if something bad had happened? What if something happened to them on the way there or on the way home instead?\n\nI felt a wave of relief wash over me at his words as he made his way out of the house. He had given me hope that maybe my friends would be found safe and sound after all.\n\nThe sheriff said his goodbyes and departed, reminding me to keep in touch. I went back to my bedroom, eager for the next morning and the grand opening of the stone castle. I was hopeful my friends would turn up, but little did I know the day would unfold entirely differently from what I had anticipated.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nStreamers and banners of various colors waved proudly in the wind, giving a celebratory feel to the occasion. Music played from an old bandstand in the corner, adding to the festive atmosphere. Locals of all ages and genders had gathered to celebrate this momentous occasion, some dressed in traditional costume and others wearing more modern attire. The towering stone walls of the castle loomed overhead like a majestic sentinel, a reminder of days gone by when castles were a symbol of power and strength.\n\nThe castle built by The Stone Master were really intricate and awe-inspiring. Towers and spires reached up to the sky, with detailed carvings in every corner. The castle were intricate and detailed works of art, constructed of a variety of stones in different shapes and sizes. They ranged from small towers with soaring spires to massive fortresses with large courtyards and multiple levels. Some carvings had been left in their natural state to show off the unique patterns and textures of the stones. Many of the castles even featured moats filled with water.\n\nI asked myself again: how he hell could he build this castle in three nights?\n\nThe sculptures ranged from abstract art to lifelike figures of animals and people, some of which looked as if they could come to life at any moment. Each one was unique and stood as a testament to the creativity of the artist. Up close, the details of each piece were astounding, with tiny patterns and shapes that captured my imagination.\n\nThe weird thing was that none of the sculptures looked as menacing today as they did when I had walked through the walls the day before. Now, the serpents, monsters, and demons seemed more lifeless. Maybe it was because there were so many other people around me: families were strolling nearby, and children were running around in excitement.\n\nAs I surveyed the place, something caught my attention. A strange feeling told me to visit the end of a hallway. I followed it and found myself in the hall. It was empty and quiet, with only a few sculptures.\n\nAnd this room was different.\n\nTheir faces had detailed eyes and noses that looked as if they could move. Some of them had body armor, swords, and spears in their hands that added to their intimidating aura. Their eyes were filled with emotion, their hands were clenched as if they were ready to move. The positions they stand in and the intricate clothing they wear make them look like they could come to life at any moment.\n\nThe sculptures had lifelike features, from the wrinkles in their clothing to the expression on their faces. Some had soft eyes and gentle smiles, while others had stern or even fearful looks. Each one was carved with fine details and exquisite craftsmanship, with intricate lines and curves that enhanced the realism of their features.\n\nAs I stood there, realization began to dawn on me as to why those four statues felt so familiar. There they were: Max, Emma and Leah, turned to stone, stilled in time forever.",

        "text": "My name is Darryl, and I am the unluckiest man on Earth. That might sound facetious, but I mean it. Minor and major misfortunes have befallen me at every juncture of my life. Woe is me, right?\n\nI truly believe that the darkness at the centre of the Universe must be to blame. Have you ever seen it? Do you know its face? I have nightmares about the blackness that governs us all.\n\nPerhaps you think I’ve lost my marbles. What makes me so special? What astronomically bad luck have I endured?\n\nI’m always unwell. I’ve lost count of the number of times that I’ve broken bones. I’ve been in *twenty-five*car crashes as a passenger, so my driving isn’t to blame. My relationships always end through unfortunate events, such as bad timing. A better-suited candidate is always chosen over me for promotions. I’ve lived in four different houses and suffered ten different floods.\n\nOh, and, to top it all off, I suffer from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Simon, as I often call him. *Simon says*. Get it? I amuse myself. Anyway, I was certainly shafted by the genetic lottery in that regard.\n\nYou can imagine, then, my surprise at actually winning something for the first time in my life. The Universe grinned wickedly. You see, it would transpire that my winning straw was, in fact, the *shortest*straw. My luck hadn’t changed at all.\n\n“I beg your pardon?” I asked.\n\n“You won a free trip to Aaron Colt’s island resort,” The group facilitator repeated. “All support group attendees were entered into a prize draw.”\n\n“I’ve never heard of Aaron Colt,” I laughed.\n\n“Me neither,” The lady replied. “But I’m sure the invitation will tell you more. Congratulations!”\n\nThe invitation only raised more questions. It read:\n\n*Hello, lucky winner!*\n\n*My name is Aaron Colt, and this ticket serves as admission to my private island. You are one of five fortunate guests. Here, you will be treated to an all-expenses-paid stay at my three-storey mansion on a beautiful, secluded isle. During your trip, I shall be offering the gift of freedom from mental disease.*\n\n*Safe travels,*\n\n*Aaron Colt*\n\nNobody had ever used the words ‘lucky’ or ‘fortunate’ to describe anything I’d said, done, or experienced. Winning something felt incredible. However, the fleeting feeling of elation was quickly replaced with distrust. *What game are you playing?* I asked the Universe.\n\nI feared the answer to that question, but that didn’t deter me from packing my bags. I’d never won anything before. At some point in my life, something good had to happen, surely? That was what I told myself. Whatever the case, I was certain, knowing my luck, that the boat would capsize. I decided I’d probably never even make it to the island.\n\nIn hindsight, that would’ve been far less horrific than what actually happened.\n\nThe small ferry, aptly named *Lucky Lucy*, arrived at the harbour on a blisteringly-warm day in June, 2022. I boarded, along with four other anxious souls. We huddled together on the main deck and, having only exchanged awkward glances on the dock, finally introduced ourselves.\n\nEmma was a forty-seven-year-old restaurant owner from Massachusetts. She suffered from bipolar disorder. She was a plain, homely woman. Frizzy blonde hair. Short in stature. Weathered eyes. Forced smile.\n\nLetitia was a twenty-eight-year-old personal trainer from London, and she suffered from schizophrenia. She was mesmerisingly beautiful. Tall, yet petite.\n\nRyan was a sixty-year-old History teacher, and he suffered from severe depression. He was only a little taller than Emma. Grey, thinning hair. Foggy, rimmed glasses. Perfectly-round face.\n\nFinally, Nathaniel was a thirty-four-year-old stock broker, and he suffered from borderline-personality disorder. He was a stoic man. Lanky. Slightly malnourished.\n\nWe spent the duration of the four-hour voyage getting acquainted. As the mound of land on the horizon grew, I started to accept that something good might actually happen to me. It was a small, forested paradise with no signs of civilisation, other than Aaron Colt’s vast villa. A free holiday *and* a chance to rid myself of mental illness? Good fortune didn’t sit well with me.\n\nTo my surprise, we arrived on the island in one piece. The sun had begun to set. We had been at sea for most of the day. Once the ferry docked, the five of us exited onto a rickety, wooden pier. There, we were greeted by our mysterious host.\n\n“Hello!” The man bellowed. “I’m Aaron Colt, and you must be my lucky ticket winners. Emma, Letitia, Darryl, Ryan, and Nathaniel. Welcome!”\n\n“Willy Wonka,” I whispered to Letitia.\n\nShe snorted with laughter, and Aaron scowled at me for a split second. His false grin, dominated by artificially-whitened teeth, quickly returned, but I noted the fleeting fury in his eyes. Just for a second, the façade had fallen. That, I felt, was the *real* Aaron Colt.\n\nOther than his untrustworthy face, however, he had an entirely unremarkable appearance. Medium height and build. Black buzz-cut hair. Doughy cheeks.\n\nThe man led us across grassy terrain to his astonishing abode. It covered a few acres of land at the edge of the island’s forest. Aaron Colt heaved open the hulking double doors of his grandiose home, and we strolled into a lavish lobby area.\n\n“Big buildings unsettle me,” Letitia shuddered. “Let’s hope Aaron Colt can fix that.”\n\n“I know we have entirely different mental illnesses, but one thing I’ve learnt is that it’s better *not* to expect a cure,” I said.\n\n“That’s a depressing thought,” Letitia replied.\n\n“Is there any other type of thought?” I quipped, making her smirk.\n\nAaron seated us at the dinner table in a grand dining room, and I got to know Letitia for the next hour or so. She talked about her struggle with schizophrenia, and I talked about my struggle with Simon. I think, perhaps, I was far too engrossed in the girl to notice the oddness of our host and the setting in which we found ourselves. In hindsight, I should’ve paid greater attention to the uneasy cloud which lingered in the air.\n\n“This final course is special,” Aaron announced, as his members of staff served plates of indistinguishable green mush before us. “I call it Nevele.”\n\n“Not particularly appetising,” Emma blurted out. “What’s so special about it?”\n\n“Never judge a book by its cover,” Aaron smiled, seemingly proud of the dozenth cliché he had used that day. “Ignore the look and taste of the food. It’s less about what it can do for your body and more about what it can do for your *mind*.”\n\nThe five guests, chosen for their various mental impairments, exchanged disbelieving glances. Did Aaron Colt mean what we all inferred that he meant?\n\n“Eat,” He instructed. “This is the moment that changes your lives. Bid adieu to your psychological afflictions.”\n\nHungering for freedom from mental illness, we all did as we were told. The five of us greedily gulped down our bowls of thick, green slosh. It didn’t taste particularly offensive. It could’ve been a bowl of tomato soup, if one were to focus on its consistency and flavour, not its colour.\n\nAnd that was it. There was no dessert. There were no evening activities. Aaron Colt slinked stealthily to his feet and announced that the evening was over.\n\n“My employees shall show you to your rooms,” He said. “Rest and recover. In the morning, you will be new people.”\n\nAs we were entering the lobby, our eerily enigmatic host hoisted Nathaniel to one side and whispered something into his ear. Nathaniel frowned, but he quickly joined the rest of us on our slow, sluggish march up the stairs to our respective rooms. The meal was sitting heavily on my stomach. I could tell the other guests felt the same.\n\n“No chance of a second ‘magical meal’ to fix my irritable bowels?” Ryan sarcastically grumbled, clutching his gurgling abdomen.\n\nThe member of staff said nothing as she hurried the old man to his room. Emma complained of stomach pain as she was shown to her room. Letitia bid me goodnight as she entered the next door on the second-floor hallway, and the employee nodded at the final door on the left for me.\n\n“What about me?” Nathaniel asked.\n\n“Third-floor,” The worker curtly responded. “Attic.”\n\nFrom my open doorway, I watched the lady lead the final guest up to the attic floor. Something was disconcerting about Aaron’s treatment of Nathaniel. What had our host whispered to the stock broker?\n\nMy room was little more than a broom closet. Disenchanting, given the impressive nature of the mansion as a whole. Still, I had a breathtaking view of the ocean from my sole window. There was also a four-poster bed, which fitted the dated decor of Aaron Colt’s bizarre home.\n\nI flopped onto my bed, nursing both a horrendous headache and a gnawing sensation in my gut. I felt atrocious. Yet, drenched in beads of sweat, I told myself that must be a good thing. *I must be healing. The Nevele must be cleansing me of toxins.*\n\nThat was what I believed until something startled me from my sleep.\n\nThere was the sudden creak of a floorboard from the far end of the room. Quivering, I peered over the top of my duvet. I laid my eyes upon something so ghastly that it defied all reason.\n\nA stone man.\n\nI realised, in my state of spiralling horror, that the terrifying thing had actually been standing there since I first entered the room. I had simply mistaken him for a statue, but he was very much alive. The entity gazed upon me with ceaseless chasms. I cannot quite explain it, but I knew him. *Simon*.\n\n“Tap your forehead three times,” It gently requested. “That’ll keep you safe. I know what’s best.”\n\nI wailed, but a paranormal power muted my primal cry of terror. I was about to free myself from my covers, but I heard scuttling noises across the wooden floor, as if a living wave were crashing towards me.\n\nBefore I had a chance to process what was coming for me, piercing pangs of pain erupted across my thighs. I looked down to see lumps wriggling beneath my cover, like the bubbles of a boiling broth. Shaking manically, I peeled back the duvet to see what was tearing at my legs.\n\nTiny terrors. Marble-bodied minions of the stone man. Their horrid yellow eyes and teeth shone in the dark cave under my cover. Blood trickled down my pale legs as the arachnid-shaped statues of the stone man feasted on my flesh.\n\nThen, the creatures sunk into the quicksand of my bloodstained bedsheets, leaving my massacred legs as a warning to abide by Simon‘s rules.\n\n“Three taps,” Simon reiterated. “Otherwise, something *terrible* will happen.”\n\n“You’ve been telling me that for years,” I whimpered, failing to conceal my horror. “You don’t control me anymore. I’m free.”\n\nSimon’s demeanour shifted, as it always did whenever I ignored his demands. He was the abusive partner that once resided in my mind. Always nice until I stopped doing what I was told.\n\n“Three taps,” He screeched. “Now!”\n\nSuddenly, the white-clad entity was swelling to fit every nook and cranny of my box-sized room. Its limbs were liquifying, as it morphed to coat every surface of its surroundings. The vicious flower bloomed. The beast always became more fearsome when I did not feed it. I had never expected that analogy to carry any literal weight.\n\nI slid out of bed in one fluid motion and, injured legs wobbling, stumbled to the door. I clumsily opened and shut it behind me. Standing in the pitch-black hallway, I expected the stone man to come crashing through the door.\n\nHe didn’t. I haven’t seen him since that fateful night. Intrusive thoughts no longer evoke any response from me. My Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is no longer part of me.\n\nSo, where did it go?\n\nEvery time I see r/nosleep posts about entities and rules, I wonder whether it might be *him*. My disorder. My curse. Unleashed upon the world. I’ve heard whispers of a stone man.\n\nI’m sorry.\n\nWorst of all, that isn’t even the end of that horrors that took place at Aaron Colt’s mansion. It’s barely the start.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle/)",

        "text": "My wife loves to hike. Doesn’t matter the weather, doesn’t matter the time. Night hikes, winter hikes, scorching hot hikes. She even has names different kinds of hikes. \n\nShe’ll do plain headlamp hikes but other times at night she’d be more creative and crack some glowsticks for a “glowey” as she’ll call it. I’ve seen her wrap a bandage around a stick, soak it in lamp oil, and go on a torch hike. \n\nShe had ideas for hikes like Bubba did for shrimp. It was impressive. \n\nSo, it was no surprise to family and friends that even when she was nearly eight weeks pregnant, we were still hiking. She planned a trip for the two of us to hike in the Northern Cascade Mountains, near the Canadian border. We joked that it was our first family hike. We knew we were having a girl and we had already named her. She was Emma, our girl. \n\nI didn’t even bother asking if Lucy thought the hike might be too strenuous. When Lucy had made up her mind to hike that was that. There was no stopping her. \n\nI packed my ultralight bag a bit heaver in case we ended up in trouble and we set out for a seven-day trip. \n\nThe first six of those days were uneventful. It was early September, the sun shined, and the nights were warm, but towards our last two days the rain began to fall, and it never stopped. \n\nSheets of rain fell so hard it was like standing in the shower. At times it was hard to even *see.* It was windless rain without a breeze. No gales—just a god damn downpour. Day and night, it went on. My socks were wet, my crotch was wet.\n\nMy underwear bunched up and hid in my butt crack and retreated no matter how many times I yanked them out. \n\nIf you’ve been camping in the rain, oh you know… it was hell. But tell that to Lucy. She had a big ol’ beaming smile that never left her face. So you see, I didn’t even have anybody to complain with. \n\nI was getting angry. I was sick of powdered mash potatoes and peanut butter. I wanted a cheeseburger and I wanted someone who could bitch with me. I was an asshole to Lucy, I’ll admit it. I was short, snappy and envious that she could always look on the bright side of life.\n\nThings got worse when we just four miles to the car. When we took a break to eat a granola bar, I noticed a carving on a tree just off the trail. I squinted through the rain and went closer. It was a pentagram. It was fresh, the wood it exposed still blond and pungent. \n\n“What’s that?” asked Lucy. \n\n“The doings of some kids.”\n\n“Is that a pentagram?” \n\n“We’re not too far from the highway now. You get all types of non-hiker types this close to civilization.” Truth be told, I was nervous and wanted to get home. I started down the trail and spoke over my shoulder. “Come on, let’s keep going.” \n\nThis is where we encountered trouble. It had rained so much a little landslide had washed away the trail. The mountain side the trail clung to was a river of mud and blocked with fallen fir trees. \n\nI had an emergency SAT phone on me. I took it out ready to call. I hated to be a burden to the rangers, but I had a pregnant wife and an act of god had taken out the trail. They’d probably be angry if I didn’t beacon for help. This situation could get bad and expend a lot more resources if we weren’t smart. \n\nBut apparently, we were idiots. Lucy had pride, too much for her own good, and when she saw me pull out the SAT phone, she immediately swung her hand towards it. “Put that away!” \n\nShe batted the phone, and it went tumbling down the mountain side, skipping across stones and sliding under the brush. \n\nI was silent with anger. The rain was too loud to hear where it might have landed. “Sorry,” said Lucy finally. “Didn’t mean to.”\n\nI began unshouldering my pack with a sigh. “Where are you going?” asked Lucy.\n\n“To get the SAT phone.”\n\n“We don’t even need that stupid thing. Let’s just cross this mess and get home.”\n\nI scoffed and started my descent into the bramble. “It’s a 400-hundred-dollar phone, Luce. Wait here.” \n\nLittle did I know it was the last I’d hear from Lucy that trip. It took me two hours to find the SAT phone. The damn thing tumbled twice as far as I even thought possible. It was like somebody moved it. \n\nWhen I got back to where I’d left Lucy I spun around in a panicked circle. “Lucy!” I yelled. “Lucy!” \n\nI didn’t waste time to investigate on my own. I immediately called the ranger station for help. The only trace of her were some boot prints that went through the landslide but those eventually faded out. \n\nI stayed out with the rescuers as night fell fast. We called her name, dispatched helicopters with thermal cameras to pick up her heat signature, but there was nothing. She’d vanished. \n\nI thought for sure we’d find her fast—there was a thirty-person rescue team and three helicopters—but she just didn’t show up. The rain hindered our search and after two exhausting weeks where every day was met with the same disappointment, the search was called off. \n\nWe didn’t live close to where Lucy went missing. We were about a four-hour drive away. That day I had to drive home was the hardest of my life. I felt like I had given up on her, given up on my unborn child. I cried the whole way back. \n\nI was told it was three more weeks before she was found, but I had long lost my sense of time. My job was generous to give me a month paid time off for my bereavement and I spent my checks on liquor and beer for the mornings when I was hungover. \n\nI even missed the first phone call from Lucy’s sister. I got the news as a god damn text. \n\n“They found her!” \n\nI frowned down at my phone and called her back. It was true. They found Lucy, and not her rotting corpse. She was alive, and even well. Other than dehydration and a twisted ankle. Apparently, she grew impatient with my searching and said screw it. She went on without me and at some point took a hard fall. \n\nWhen she stood up her bearings were wrong, and she hiked determinedly to the southwest when she should’ve been heading *northwest.*\n\nI was mad at the story. I’d almost assumed she’d been kidnapped by Satanists. I didn’t think Lucy would just take off on me like that. But still, I was grateful she’d been found. \n\nI wanted to drive back the mountains to see her, they were holding her at a local hospital. Lucy’s family had already left to see her. I guess it was a good thing I was too drunk to drive, because a couple hours later I got a call saying Lucy had left the hospital. “Escaped” is the word they used. \n\nI was concerned but decided to give the situation some time. I still wasn’t sober enough to be much help to anyone. \n\nA couple hours later the security light in the backyard turned on. I heard footsteps on the back stairs. I froze, as I heard a timid knock on the backdoor. \n\nI ran to open it and flung it open. There was Lucy, her face pale, cold, and riddled with ruby scabs from scrapes. I wrapped my arms around her and began to cry. “Hey, hey.” Lucy patted my back and played it off cool just like she was liable to. “I’m okay.” She pushed into me so we were inside and shut the door behind us. \n\n“Why did you leave the hospital? Are you both?” I looked at her belly. To my relief she was as pregnant as ever. “Is the baby okay?” \n\n“I didn’t let them check. It’s why I left the hospital.” \n\n“What!? Why not?”\n\n“This child… it’s going to be stillborn, okay?”\n\n“Her name’s Emma, remember? And why are you saying that?” I choked on my words as my voice became thick with tears. I put my hand on Lucy’s stomach. “Did she stop kicking?” \n\n“Yeah…. She stopped kicking.” \n\nMy shoulders sank. I plopped on the couch. “I’m happy you’re okay but… I need a minute.” \n\n“Ahh.” Lucy flung her hands to her stomach in pain and I sprang back up.   \n \n\n“Are you okay, the baby could still be coming. You’ll still give birth.” \n\n“No,” Lucy shook her head violently. “That’s not what this is.” She stepped around me quickly to the bathroom and dropped to her knees in front of the toilet. “I’m sick.” As soon as she said it a torrent of black vomit burst from her mouth. I rushed to her and held her hair and patted her back while she heaved.\n\nBefore I even saw her vomit, I noticed the smell of wet earth fill the bathroom. Mud. I leaned over her shoulder and looked in the toilet bowl. I wrinkled my face in disgust. I was expecting to see the hospital food she couldn’t hold down, but instead the toilet was full of black dirt. I gagged as I saw a worm, shining pink in the puke. \n\n“What the fuck, Lucy?” \n\nShe reached up, flushed the toilet, and kept vomiting. It was five full minutes before she stopped gagging. I backed up as she stood, washed her hands and rinsed out her mouth. \n\n“I had to look pregnant.”\n\nHer words were lost on me until she turned around and I saw that after all her vomiting her stomach had flattened considerably. She still had a bit of a bump, but she looked less pregnant when we first set out on our hike.\n\n“No one could know. You understand?” \n\nI didn’t understand, and I stared back at Lucy in a frightened silence. \n\n“The hospital… they’d tell the news people and everyone would know. It was the stress. The stress and… our little girl came early, and you can’t understand… you can’t begin to understand. I was in the woods for weeks with nothing to eat.” She looked at me and the blood left my face—it’s still yet to return. \n\n“Don’t judge me,” Lucy snapped. “You have no idea what it’s like to be [starving.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

        "text": "As I lay in bed, unable to move or speak, I knew that the beast of sleep paralysis had come to visit me again. I could feel its cold, clammy hands on my chest, holding me down as it whispered dark, terrifying secrets into my ear. Things that nobody other than myself would know. Things that shake me to my core. Things that give me crippling anxiety just thinking of. I tried to scream, but no sound would come out. I knew my fate was in its hands for the night. All I could do was hope for some mercy. \n\nThe monstrous shadow knew my deepest fears, and it began to play it out in the dream world taking place in my own bedroom. It was turning my thoughts into reality; a visual hallucination. My walls were transforming from plain white, to landscapes I remembered all too well. It dragged me into a dark, endless abyss where I was chased by a faceless figure that represented all my insecurities and regrets. The time I lost my baby brother, because I was too careless to hold his hand as we crossed the road. The friend that committed suicide over a fight we had. A friend that I could’ve saved. Its presence forced those memories into my vision. Blinding me with regret. The figure seemed to take pleasure in my terror as it made the beast grow larger and more menacing with each passing moment. Every regret I relived, it became stronger, more controlling, allowing it to drill further into the depths of my brain. Finding those thoughts that even I had buried too far away to remember.\n\nI could feel the figure’s hot breath on my neck as it whispered in my ear, \"You can never escape me. I will always be here, waiting for you in the darkness. I can come and go as I please. You will always fear me. Wondering if tonight is the night I take you away again. You will never know peace again. And it’s exactly what you deserve..”\n\nI begged and pleaded for it to let me go. I was unable to speak, but it knew exactly what I was trying to communicate. However, it only cackled in response. It seemed to thoroughly enjoy my suffering, and wanted to prolong it as long as possible. My fear was its nourishment. The more I lost, the more it gained. \n\nI was trapped in this nightmare for what felt like an eternity. Hell, maybe it was. All time is lost when you’re in the back seat of your own mind. Finally, the soul-sucking demon released its grip on me. I woke up gasping for air, my heart racing and my mind still filled with the images of the terrifying, ruthless thoughts it made me relive.\n\nI knew that it would be back again, lurking in the shadows, waiting for me to fall asleep so it could once again drag me into the dream world it created, all for the sole purpose of draining my will to live. It will continue to torture me with my deepest fears. And I knew that I would never be able to escape it, for it was a part of me and would always be there. A constant reminder of the terror that lurks in the darkness of my mind.\n\nMay luck be on my side tonight. May I sleep peacefully.. just this once.",

        "text": "Hello all, quick introduction. Long story short, I’m a fighter pilot and proud to say it. I went to pilot training in north Texas where I got the privilege of training with all of our wonderful NATO partners. We flew the T-6 Texan II for the first half of the (approximately) year-long course and then the T-38 Talon for the second half. The T-6 was an overpowered crop duster and the T-38 was a supersonic wannabe fighter jet that had the turn radius of a Ford Ranger carrying a 60 foot boat (it was massive). She loved to go fast and hated being slow, and she’d kill you real fast if you weren’t careful. Anyways, pilot training is a stressful time where you just cram as much knowledge into your nugget as you can and hope you perform to the level of excellence that they (the instructors) expect. It is extremely challenging and rewarding at the same time because at the end of it, you get to call yourself a pilot and at our specific program where we train to be fighter pilots, most of us go on to fly the F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning (Fat Amy), or F-16 Viper. Sometimes dudes get the B-52, B-1, or B-2 but not as often as the former.\n\nDuring my time in the T-38, I experienced something that would make me question quite a bit about our known world. It was about the same time that the DoD released the UFO reports from the Navy and announced they will be conducting more investigations to figure out what is actually going on. In my young and arrogant mind I thought “hey maybe one day when I have my own fast jet with a super fancy targeting pod and state-of-the-art radar maybe I’ll see a UFO.” But I was just a lieutenant in a T-38 with none of that stuff; just my Mk II eyeballs to make sure I don’t hit another airplane or the ground. I was deep into the formation phase of training where we train to fly really close to another airplane through all phases of flight to make sure we can do it without trading paint. It was a standard October day in Texas and I was scheduled to fly with one of my good classmates in the other jet whom I enjoyed flying with because he and I were both pretty damn good at flying in formation. We briefed up the sortie as a standard 2-ship formation ride just before our checkride which meant we were pretty much running the show from engine startup to shutdown. One part of the brief that we talk about is weather and NOTAMS (you know that thing that caused the nationwide ground stop a few weeks ago? Those things). One NOTAM that stood out was talking about some GPS interference out in the MOA we would be working in but not to worry, it was clear and a million out there; not a cloud in sight and our operations were based off radial/DME from the VORTAC which was working just fine so no GPS? We didn’t care too much.\n\nMe and my buddy did our usual preflight routines of taking a piss, making sure we hyped each other up for the sortie then getting our takeoff data, tail numbers, and final words from the supervisor before putting on our gear. Walking out to the jets we did our normal cool-guy walk, helmet bag over the shoulder with shades on and our finest headbands sporting our training class patch. We passed our hand signals and got the jets running, taxied out to the runway and took off in the tightest fingertip formation you could ever ask for from a student; we were on something different today. Issues started when we eventually FENCE-IN to the MOA. My GPS was acting funky but we expected this so I just ignored it; I heard my wingman’s voice come over the radio shortly after I noticed.\n\n“Hammer 1 from 2?”\n\n“Go ahead 2”\n\n“GPS is degraded, yours too?”\n\n“1 copies, yeah mine’s degraded too”\n\nI hear my IP chime in from the backseat to humbly remind me that I’m still a student “clear concise comm on the radio, cut out the extra BS” to which I respond with a swift “copy.”\n\nAfter getting our G-exercise done we did a turning rejoin and while I’m focusing on flying the proper parameters I get a call from the area controller.\n\n“Hammer 1, Fort Worth Center”\n\n“Center, Hammer 1?” I reply clearly and concisely as my IP said.\n\n“Hammer 1 I’ve got VFR traffic transiting your area at your right 2 o’clock and 6 miles altitude indicates 11,500 and no one’s talking to him”\n\nThis is right in my way as our airspace is from 8,000 up to 22,000 and is one of those things we run a knock-it-off drill which means “let’s stop training for now until they leave so it’s safe for us to maneuver again.” After all, transiting traffic is a relatively normal occurrence in this part of Texas.\n\n“Hammer knock it off, Hammer 1 knock it off” I say swiftly on our interflight radio\n\n“Hammer 2 knock it off, copy traffic call” my wingman says.\n\n“Hammer 2, go fighting wing” which tells my wingman to stay close to me and maneuver freely on my wing as we inspect this intruder.\n\n“Center, Hammer 1 is looking for the traffic; can we get a direction and altitude?”\n\n“Hammer 1, Fort Worth Center, he appears stationary at your 11 o’clock and 4 miles altitude still indicates eleven-five”\n\n“Hammer 1 copies, we’re looking.”\n\nAt this point I know within 3 miles I should be able to see something especially when I’m at 10,500 looking slightly up into blue sky. I slow my scan pattern and I ask my IP in the back “you see anything?” to which he replies “nah, I don’t even see him on the iPad.” Squinting my eyes now I keep my lookout while also monitoring my own altitude and speed, looking back at my wingman who I can see he is looking in the same direction desperately trying to find this guy.\n\n“Hammer 1, Fort Worth Center, traffic now 11 o’clock 2 miles stationary.”\n\n“Shit he’s close” I say to myself but I’m cut off as my #2 comes over the aux radio\n\n“Hammer 2 tally 1 left 11 o’clock high, looks like a weather balloon”\n\nI refocus my eyes and he pops into my field of view.\n\n“Hammer 1’s visual” I say mildly confused.\n\nWe pass by this extremely polished silver bean-shaped object at 350 knots, so I bank it up and pull to maintain tally of this guy as I see #2 follow in suit just behind me.\n\n“Fort Worth Center, Hammer 1 is visual with the traffic. It looks like a weather balloon? he’s… not moving though.”\n\n“What do you mean he’s not moving?”\n\nI wanted to say something sarcastic but you can’t really do that on the radio so I more politely replied “Looks like a weather balloon”\n\n“Uhhh, center copies?”\n\nMy mind is completely boggled at this point. Weather balloons don’t look this symmetric and I’m pretty sure they aren’t bean-shaped and they usually have instruments or something hanging off of it; this had none of that. “what the hell?” I say to myself and my IP replies “this is a first.” He gets on the radio next to talk to the other IP in the other jet.\n\n“2 bravo from 1?”\n\n“Go”\n\n“You seeing this too?”\n\n“Yeah I’m not sure what to think of it”\n\n“Should we call someone?”\n\n“Dude who do you even call for this?”\n\n“No idea”\n\n“Hammer 1. Fort Worth Center, can you contact us on 3XX.XX?” The controller rudely cuts us off.\n\nThat channel is just a less cluttered frequency, I think he’s isolating us at this point so they can talk to just us. And not the other hundred airplanes transiting through the Texas airspace.\n\n“Hammer push 3XX.XX” I say to direct my wingman to switch to the new frequency.\n\n“Hammer check?”\n\n“2” I hear in a more concerned tone now.\n\n“Center, Hammer 1?”\n\n“Hammer 1… this is uhh, Fort Worth Center got you loud and clear” now this is a new voice, an older-sounding voice than the young female one I heard earlier.\n\n“Hammer 1, can you give me the details of that contact?”\n\nI reply swiftly “Center, it looks like a big silver bean-shaped weather balloon, maybe 20 foot diameter and 40 foot long”\n\n“Center copies, Hammer 1 advise you stay clear of that contact outside of a mile”\n\n“Hammer 1 copies”\n\nI ease off the bank and G’s to widen the circle I’m carving around this “balloon” and glance down at my gas. “Hammer ops check, 1 is 2.3” I say. “2 is 2.2” my buddy replies. Great, we have enough gas to continue for a bit longer. As I move my eyes back to the object I see what looks like a green light coming out of the middle.\n\n“Hey you see that light?” I say to my IP. He says “yeah, is it glowing?” he cautiously replies at which point he jumps on the radio.\n\n“Center, Hammer 1 it looks like there’s a green light coming off of it”\n\nThe older voice comes back in a serious tone “Hammer 1, center copies, we’re looking into it”\n\n“Hammer 1 we have no confirmation of weather balloons released in that area, advise you separate.”\n\n“Okay Hammer 1 copies” and as I roll out of the bank I notice that green light turn to a deep red and begin to pulse on and off. Just as I notice the subtle light change I see a beam of red cross in front of my jet which expands in size vertically like a wall that was erected out of thin air. “SHIT!” I say as I try to pull out of the way but the beam cuts off my trajectory and I fly right through this red film. I look back behind me at what I just flew through, and I see the perfect silhouette of the T-38 in the film in addition to my wingman rolling inverted and jinking down to avoid the same beam but it was to no use. The beam tracked my wingman and he flew straight through it to the same result. 2 perfect T-38 silhouettes imprinted on this red beam that retracts itself into the object like a lightsaber being turned off after we passed through.\n\nWe watched in confusion as the bean rotated along its longitudinal axis and shot straight up into the darkness. “What… the… f\\*\\*\\* just happened” my IP said in the backseat.\n\n“Hammer 1, Fort Worth Center, we’ve lost that contact, are you still visual?”\n\n“Negative Center, It flew straight up and it’s gone”\n\n“Say again Hammer 1?”\n\n“It’s gone.” As I unkeyed the mic my IP came on the radio “We’ll get vectors back to Homeplate, VFR now.”\n\n“Hammer 1, center copies IFR cancellation received, turn right 080 vectors Homeplate”\n\nThe whole ride back was a mix of utter confusion and mild terror. Center swapped us to the approach controller who we talked to pretty much all the way back home and then to the tower controller who told us that we’d be met by someone at parking. As we were rolling up to our parking spots and shutting down we were met by the wing flight safety truck and a couple of men not from our unit with a hardened laptop. They brought us aside on the flightline away from all the other jets and crew chiefs and asked us a few questions about what we saw, what we did, and if there were any other details that would help their investigation. As we responded, one of the guys would type away on the laptop. We gave them our copies of the flash drives which stored the HUD tapes and audio recordings from the jet and the guy with plugged them into his laptop. He finished uploading the material onto the computer and we watched the highlights on the tape, listened to the recordings and when he was satisfied said “alright we got what we need.” They asked us to keep quiet about the whole ordeal until they finish up their investigation and we asked when we’ll hear back they said “you’ll know I’m sure.” We finally passed on our contact information and they said “if we need anything else from you we’ll find you” which made all of us a bit uneasy but hey, we’re in the military. I’m sure we won’t be that hard to find.\n\nWe got back to the debrief and my IP took the 3 of us aside and said “you heard those guys; they seemed serious. Let’s not talk about it. Consider this the debrief.” My friend and I looked at each other, shrugged, and walked into the flight room talking the same game we normally do with our classmates. Every now and again when we run into each other we’ll have a few beverages of the alcoholic variety and bring up the memory but it’s becoming more rare nowadays. All I know is that whatever we saw that day now knows what a T-38 is; luckily, we have more lethal stuff than that piece of junk so hopefully we’ll be ready.",

They weren't murdered or let go or anything. They were initiated into whatever occult practice they were following. It made me wonder though, why Nolan. I was their target, but *he* was the one they took by force like that. I guess what I'm asking is what made *me* so special?\n\nNot only that, but why was I the only one hearing the voices like I was and why did I feel so... so... I don't know, so *hollow* without them?\n\nI was carried from the car where I was following the discovery and put in the back of the officer's cruiser. Backup arrived about a minute after, where a few others tried, and failed, to question me, about either my state of being or about the events themselves. I was essentially a doll to them, completely empty on the inside. No mental capacity whatsoever.\n\nTime passed, though I had no perception of it whatsoever, and I was taken to the hospital to be checked for any sort of head trauma. Somewhere along the way, I picked up that they were called to the scene from a random passerby, someone I somehow, though not entirely surprisingly, given the circumstances during and afterward, that I hadn't picked up on before. At the hospital, they tried again to question me about what happened and/or if I had any family members that could look after me. Again, I just sat and stared blankly at them.\n\nI don't know how long it was; days, weeks, hell maybe even a full *month* (sure as hell felt like it anyway), before I started coming back to a *semblance* of my normal mind. Obviously, I never fully recovered, but I could at least perceive the world around me, and I'd respond occasionally when one of the nurses spoke to me. For the most part, though, I was isolated after that, not speaking or doing much of anything that didn't feel necessary to me. The police came one or two more times, but both times got them more or less the same result as before. I was lucid now, sure, but that didn't mean I had any better grasp on what was going on in the street that day.\n\nSo the days, weeks, months, whatever, passed and I was eventually discharged from the hospital. ANd before you ask, yes, I did undergo extensive brain scans and MRIs to see whether or not I had any sort of abnormalities, and no, outside of the usual factors of an autistic brain, I was perfectly fine. I was sent from there to a boy's home just along the edge of town, having no other surviving family to take me in. My time there was weird more than anything else.\n\nI won't say bad, I was okay enough and the others were nice enough to me, but ever since the day in the street, I couldn't ever shake the feeling of isolation from the other kids. From other *people,* in fact. I never understood it, but for some reason, I just felt like there was something about me that just *didn't belong* here anymore. Like there was something about me that was just *wrong.* I couldn't be happy at things other people were, I couldn't get emotional at the same things they did. Nothing had any meaning to me, I guess I'm trying to say here.\n\nThing is, I knew this wasn't depression, either, least not in the way I've always understood it. It's not that I didn't want to be happy, but always felt sad. No, I couldn't feel happy *or* sad.\n\nIn any case, I was turning 17 when I did it. When I made the single most regrettable decision of my life. When I decided to go back to Hallowed Stone. By that time, it'd gotten into my head that, without the voices, the screams, I was set to be this way, empty, forever. I guess you could call it my mind's last hope at trying to properly regain my stability in trying to reintroduce the voices that'd seemed to be a sustenance for it. The thought of it scared me, admittedly, but I wasn't going to live an empty husk the rest of my life, either. It was nighttime and I was the only one still awake in the home. I shared a room with a bunk mate by the name of Frank. \"Froggy\" we called him, due to his eyes both being the size of satellite dishes.\n\nI didn't realize just how light a sleeper \"Froggy\" was until I had just made it down the ladder of our bunk and saw him stir and sit up. \"Wha-What're you doing man?\" he asked, groggy. I stared at him, startled and unsure of how the hell to even try explaining to him that I was sneaking out to go trespass in the cemetery. Despite the fact that \"Froggy\", from as much as I'd come to know him by then, wasn't a snitch, I still didn't feel comfortable with him knowing. He wouldn't understand, plus, though not a snitch, he *was* a bit of an adventurer. He'd want in, and I wasn't trying to be responsible for someone else.\n\n\"I-I'm, uh... Going out.\" He went upright in the bed.\n\n\"Out? Where? Dude, do you know what frickin' time it is?\" I sighed and made for the door. \"Hold up, man.\"\n\nI should've kept going. Should've ignored him and gone right out that door, but no. I stayed and turned to face him. He was jumping from his bunk to run over to me. \"Hold up, man, I'm comin' with.\"\n\n\"Dude, no, I--\" I was cut off when I saw him cup his hands to his mouth like he was about to shout. I grabbed his wrists and glared into his eyes. He just stared back, knowing he had the upper hand here. \"Fine.\" I growled, sighing, \"But you better stick by me at all times and so help me GOD, if a word of this goes to ANYONE--\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I get it. Now, where're we going?\"\n\nI clenched my jaw. \"I'll tell you in a minute, let's get out of here first.\" We quietly slipped out of our room and ducked down. The hallway was quiet, dark. Fortunately, our particular room was one of the ones just a few feet or so away from the main lobby. The two of us were able to easily enough sneak by without making much of a sound.\n\nOnce we made it to the lobby, we were out the front door and scurrying like a couple of ninjas into the night. After clearing the premises of the boy's home, Froggy stopped me. \"Okay, we're out now, so what's next?\" I looked at him, inhaling sharply.\n\n\"Hallowed Stone.\" His eyebrows cocked at me. \"You know, the cemetery where--\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know the place, but why *there?*\" I sighed again. I was afraid he'd ask this question. I truthfully am having a hard time even now trying to explain my reasoning for this, so you can imagine it being damn near impossible for me back then.\n\n\"I... I got a... a...\"\n\n\"What? A dealer? You trying to get a little bit of green?\" He had that wry, wild smile on his face. I would've corrected him, if it weren't for the fact that at least *that* sounded plausible. Weird how the truth works sometimes, isn't it?\n\n\"Y-Yeah... Yeah, I'm gonna get a couple dimebags.\"\n\n\"Bro, and you weren't gonna cut me in?\" He punched me on the shoulder and exclaimed, \"The fuck!\"\n\n\"Shh, dude. You trying to wake the fuckin' world up and let them know we snuck out?\" He plastered an \"Oopsie-daisy\" smile and shrugged. I pinched the bridge of my nose and sighed. \"Look, let's just go. I'll uh...\" I paused for a moment, feeling both foolish and anxious about what I was going to say next, \"I'll let you have some, okay?\" He winked and clicked his tongue at me and we headed off for the cemetery. It was about another half hour before we came upon it again. Half an hour through a cold, windy, yet eerily quiet night.\n\nWe stood at the gate of Hallowed Stone for about a good ten or so minutes with me just blankly staring off into the distance inside. Somehow, I saw the grounds, the swaying grass, the worn, weathered headstones, and the cluster of trees along the other edge of the outer fence, and I imagined that I was looking into a black sort of abyss. A sort of Hell where eternal fire itself was snuffed out, suffocated, by darkness, pure and unfiltered, like the inside of a black hole.\n\nI stared into Hallowed Stone, and I was staring into oblivion itself. Into nonexistence itself. Immediately, I was hollow again. I could see Froggy shaking my right shoulder, but I couldn't feel it.\n\n*\"You're here... You've come... Come closer, Hank...\"* Before I knew it, my foot was crossing the threshold, entering Hallowed Stone.\n\n\"Dude, what the hell are you doing?\" Froggy's voice pitifully cried out, almost immediately being drowned out by the sea of ghoulish wails. I continued forward, staring straight ahead of me.\n\n*\"Closer, Hank. Come. Come.\"*\n\nI was approaching the stretch of trees. The darkness ahead swallowed what little bit of color there was the closer I came to them. This time, it wasn't just my senses that dissolved away at the return of the voices. No, this time, it felt like with each step I took, big or small, I somehow lost more and more parts of myself. Like each step was somehow slowly ejecting my spirit from my body.\n\n*\"It's time, Hank. He's waiting. We're all waiting...\"*\n\nThe abyss was all around me now. In next to no time at all, I was in the center of the cemetery, surrounded by the dense trees. Through it all, I could see three hooded figures standing in front of me, about three or four feet away, with their arms outstretched to me, beckoning to me.\n\n*\"Come into the End. Come... and be complete.\"*\n\nMy mind was completely gone now. Gone entirely from my body. I was watching my body move forward from outside of it. Their voices were deafening now.\n\n*\"He waits to be completed!\"*\n\n\"Hank!\" Cried Froggy again, being once again drowned out. \"Hank, wait up, what're you doing?\" I keep walking, paying neither him nor *anything* any attention. Suddenly, I heard him cry out, \"Hey, wait, what the?\" I stopped then. I wanted to turn to see what was going on with Froggy, of course, but I was a statue. It was like I'd had just enough self control left in me to be able to make myself stop in acknowledgement of my friend's distress, but not enough to actually respond to it.\n\nI heard Aunt Rosa's voice blast in my ear, *\"Come, Hank. There's nothing for you here, in this world. This is our fate, the fate of all things that be. To become one, in the End.\"*\n\nMy legs were shaking, stuck between wanting to move forward at the voices' commands, move backward to see what was going on with Froggy, and just wanting to stand perfectly still. \"Deadlocked\" I guess is the word for it. Nolan's voice then came in my other ear.\n\n*\"Don't you want to be with us again?\"* His voice sounded small. Weak. Sad, even, like me not wanting to comply was hurting his feelings. The same went for Aunt Rosa and all the others that were swarming me in that moment for that matter. I heard Froggy let out more cries of panic from behind me. The trio in front of me started toward me, gliding, so it seemed, across the grass, defying gravity. My legs shook harder and harder until I finally managed somehow to break the entropy I was under and turned around.\n\nFroggy was in the arms of two of the figures from behind me. I saw them wrestle him to the ground with ease just like they had with Nolan and my mother before. *\"Join us, Hank.\"* I heard, louder than ever, blasting into my ears. *\"He waits to be completed. Join us in taking him.\"*\n\nLike that, I was under their influence again, out of my own mind and taking steps once again toward them. Though I've been saying a million times now that when I was like this, empty, I couldn't feel things like when someone was touching me, I felt the hands of two of the three hooded figures I was approaching earlier touch my shoulder. To say \"feel\", though, is admittedly the only way I really know how to describe it, despite it not being entirely accurate. It wasn't so much a \"feeling\" as it was a sense. A sort of perception that wasn't entirely tangible.\n\nIn layman's terms, it's the closest you'd ever get to knowing what it felt like to a ghost touching you. You \"feel\" something, but there's nothing to actually *feel.* That's what that was, and I turned to face them. They both stared back at me, using their free hands to remove their hoods to reveal their vulpine grins, with their coal black eyes, piranha teeth, and ghoulish skin to match. My eyes grew, seeing this.\n\nThey all had it, the features of the Black-Eyed man. Dots began connecting in my head with the man's deep, bellowed words from the day Nolan was abducted, *\"We are, all of us, one in the end...\"*\n\nThe one at my left, a young man I didn't know at all, lowered his jaws wide like he was about to swallow me whole and, in the familiar bellow, he said, *\"There's nothing to fear, Child. The End comes to all. All things that began, were separated, but can be joined in the end.\"* He looked over again to the ones holding Froggy. *\"You hear them, don't you, Hank? They cry for you. They need you... WE need you...\"*\n\nI follow his gaze to see them positioning Froggy in the same star-shaped position they had with Momma that day. I could hear Froggy yelling at them, \"Get the fuck off me! Hank, help! Get these psycho-fucks off me!\" I didn't move. I couldn't move. Not only that, though, but part of me didn't... Didn't *want* to move.\n\n*\"Take him, Child.\"* Commanded the voice of the man beside me. *\"Deliver him into the End. Become one with us all, Hank.\"*\n\nI started toward them. Froggy had his neck arched up to me, staring straight into my eyes with an expression of utter terror chiseled on his face. \"Hank, what the hell?\" he cried. \"What the fuck is going on, what are you doing?\"\n\nI said nothing. With each step I took, he began writhing violently in his captor's arms. I kept eye contact the entire time I was approaching. Every shade of fear, every shade of anguish and sorrow, and every shade of dread had washed over his face at least twice by the time I reached them. I stood over him for a moment, beholding the sight of him at my mercy. It felt like nothing to me. There was no thrill, no adrenaline, nothing. I saw this sight the way I saw wet paint on a wall beginning to set. It meant nothing to me.\n\nThere was no reason in my head. No feeling throughout my body. No soul inside me. I was nothing. All that was left that indicated to me that I was even alive *at all* were the thousands of millions of wailing voices that had, by that point, formed themselves into a sort of droning ambiance in my mind. That was all I was, an empty vessel for a screaming legion, a conduit, just like I realized the rest of these hooded people were.\n\nTears ran in bullets down Froggy's cheeks. \"Dude, please!\" he squealed. His attempts at freedom had become feeble by now. The figure at my left took his hand from my shoulder and pulled out a blade before kneeling down to him. Facing me, raising his arms into the air, I heard him recite, *\"We take thy body, that is thy vessel.\"* Froggy screamed as the blade came down, plunging right above his navel and dragging it upward. His cries were quickly changed into desperate gasps for breath. Just like with my mother, I could do nothing but stand there and watch, hypnotized.\n\nHe withdrew the blade and raised it into the air again before plunging it into his left shoulder, reciting, *\"We take thy spirit, that is thy mortality.\"* Froggy's body writhed wildly. The figure dragged the blade across his chest before then withdrawing and repeating the process on the other side, reciting, *\"We take thy blood, that is thy life.\"* Froggy's body relaxed and his eyes started to glaze. The blade was raised into the air again and the figure said, *\"And we deliver it unto the End, that we may be complete.\"*\n\nWhat came next disgusts me. It's given me countless nightmares, even beyond what I'd experienced the year before after losing both Nolan and Momma, though not just because of the sheer trauma I witnessed, but because of the part I played in it. Noah, If this is you reading this, if you think me any lesser as a man, a husband, or as your father, I understand. I want you to know that I love you, and that I always tried, just for you.\n\nAfter making this declaration, Froggy's skin was peeled away like a candy wrapper to expose his innards underneath. Froggy was still alive, too, just barely audibly gasping for breath. I want to throw up, thinking about it now, all the open guts on display like that, but back then, in that moment, I had no reaction at all to this. The figure then reached down into the center of his chest area and tightly grabbed his heart, forcefully ripping it away while the other three or four then began picking at everything left of him like they were vultures. He held the still -- though only barely -- beating heart out to me, offering it to me.\n\n*\"Take it and join us in The End, Hank.\"* I stared at him, at the heart, at the figures ravenously devouring my friend, and then back at him. I could hear Froggy's screams the same as I could hear Momma's before, slowly spiraling into my head to mix with the legion of other voices screaming at me. My hand unconsciously began to raise up as if to take the heart from him. As it did so, the louder and louder, the closer and closer, I heard Froggy's screams invade my mind.\n\n*\"Take it, Hank. Consume the spirit and join us!\"* The tips of my fingers brushed against the fading organ when I heard something that had my mind divided in half. It was Momma's voice. It wasn't like the others, though. It wasn't goading me like they were, but instead it was just her screaming.\n\nThis, I believe, is what broke me. She wasn't just crying out, she was begging. I couldn't hear any speech from it, but I could hear it in her voice. My arm stopped, beginning to shake. My mind was returning, I could feel it. The voices shrieked louder at me, pushing me to take the heart, but Momma's cries drowned them out. The voices started fading again into the back of my head.\n\nMy senses were returning to me. I could feel the icy night wind pricking across my bare flesh. I could feel the grass under my bare feet. I could feel the soft tissue of the now dead heart against my fingertips. I could actually bring my arm down. I began to backpedal away. My mind was clear again. I was myself again, my mind was my own.\n\nThe figure clutching the heart took a step toward me. I could see he sensed that something was up. He knew I wasn't under his or who/whatever's spell anymore. His grin lowered to form a menacing scowl. Without wasting another second, I turned and started booking for the exit of Hallowed Stone. From behind me, I could hear a deafening howl that sounded like a thousand wolves howling at the same time from inside a hurricane.\n\nOut of reflex, I turned back to see them all gliding toward me, flying across the grass and past the headstones. This shot bolts of adrenaline through me like it was electricity flowing through a circuit board and I was zipping through the cemetery yard myself, my focus dead set on the front gates. I couldn't see them, but I could hear them, all right in my tail. I didn't stop.\n\nAnother howl blasted from behind me, sounding like the mix of a hyena's shriek and the bellow of a lion. I didn't stop, though, until something caught my ankle and I was jerked to the ground. When I looked behind me this time, I couldn't help but scream. The figures, all of them, all with their black eyes, jagged teeth, and albino skin, were now conjoined into one giant, writhing, disgusting abomination that had the primary head of the one that was offering me the heart earlier, and with the rest of them having their heads and torsos acting as its many limbs.\n\nThe primary head opened its mouth and with a thunderous, inhuman voice, I heard it shout, ***\"This is truth, Hank! This is humanity's true form, from the beginning of time, and so to until its end. We are what you all become, in the end.\"***\n\nI frantically started trying to jerk my ankle free. It had the grip of a bear trap around me, with its nails even managing to dig deeper and deeper with each jerk, tearing more and more through it with each try. It stung like hell, feeling like hot pokers and shards of broken glass were being forcefully jammed into my ankle, but I was able to wrench my foot free from its grasp. I sprang up as quickly as I could and started again making for the gates. I was limping, each rime weight was put on my foot, excruciating pain erupted from my ankle. I ignored it as much as possible though and kept running.\n\nI heard the thing behind me gaining on me. Only for a second did it cross my mind that, even if I made it to and out of the gates, what was stopping it from leaving and following me. This would ultimately be something that would come back to haunt me now, almost ten years later. I kept running, through the gate and out into the street. I'd made it about halfway down the street away from Hallowed Stone before the adrenaline wore off enough for me to turn around and see if they were still after me.\n\nThere was nothing. The street was empty, quiet. I was alone. I was hurt.\n\n*I was lost*.\n\nPanic started buzzing around in my head. What was I gonna do? What could I do? Where was I supposed to go? Back to the Boy's home? And what was I supposed to say?\n\n*\"Me and Froggy snuck out to fuck around in Hallowed Stone and we were jumped by these hooded psychos that murdered him.\"*\n\nIt was the truth, but how was I going to be able to explain that to them? I'm having a hell of a time *now* just trying to explain it in writing, never even mind trying to explain it as a 17 year old kid that could just *barely* handle himself. Contradictory to all of this, though, to answer your question, yes, that's exactly what I did.\n\nIt took me almost an hour, and every second of it was spent in agony with sharp pains running through my foot. Regardless, I managed to make it there, where I then proceeded to limp my way in and down the halls, calling out for someone to help me. After about a minute or so, I heard the footsteps of the administrative staff come stomping down the hallway for me. I gotta say, it's almost funny, normally hearing those footsteps would've sent me into a panic, knowing that there was gonna be trouble. This time, though, despite the hysterical state of mind I was still in, as well as the fact that I still wasn't sure how I was going to explain what happened, I almost couldn't have been more relieved when I saw them come for me.\n\nWhat happens after this is mostly history. The major events that happened soon after were that the police were called, and I gave the best statement I could to them both. I stuck to the truth, too, unbelievable as it may have been, and to their credit, they at least *seemed* to take me seriously -- probably due in part to the fact that they had already seen bits of it for themselves the year before. After that, I was taken to the hospital again to be treated for my foot. They were able to close the wounds and stitch it up, but the doctors told me I'd never be able to use it properly again, with the ligaments having all been severed.\n\nI walked from then to the present with a cane and a limp. I can't feel anything in that foot. At least, though, I could feel everything else. At least, I could for another ten years after.\n\nI stayed with the Boy's home for another year until I turned 18 and aged out. From there, they were able to help plug me into a small job as a cashier at a grocery store, a job where I was allowed certain accommodations because of my condition. Over the next year and a half, I was able to save up enough money to buy a house just a little ways away from the old neighborhood, far from Hallowed Stone, and soon after that, Noah, was when I met your mother. And after that, well... we had you, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\n\nI just wished it all would've ended there. It should've. But last week, it all started happening again. Te episodes started again. The voices, I could hear them crying out to me again. Aunt Rosa, Nolan, all of them, all calling for me to return to the cemetery to finish what they'd started. At first, I tried counteracting them with the memory of Momma's screams, the same way I did that night in the cemetery, but this quickly lost its effect, leaving me with no other defense.\n\nI've been seeing them, too, stalking me and my family from dark corners of the alleys and off in the distances. They stand there, holding their hands out to me, goading me just like they did years ago. I thought I'd escaped them when, in reality, I'd only led them around, now bringing more innocent people, including my own wife and son, into their cross hairs.\n\nAll because I just had to go back to Hallowed Stone...\n\nSo to whoever's reading this, this's what I want you to know; that I am truly sorry. By the time you read this, I'll have been long gone, either meeting my fate in whatever gruesome fashion these ghouls concoct, or by being presumably inducted into their fold. Yes, this is it. You will never see me again, or at least, not as the man I was. I hope you won't see me again at all. In any case, I am returning one last time to Hallowed Stone, and so this is goodbye.\n\nTo Diana and Noah, I love you both and I hope that somewhere, somehow, we can all be together again...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI found this yesterday, after passing the third day unsuccessfully searching for my father. It was Wednesday, after I'd come home from the bus stop, that I found that he had disappeared. He'd been gone since Tuesday afternoon. Me and Mom called the police and a missing persons report was issued.\n\nI don't know exactly when this was written, but if I had to guess, it would've been that Tuesday. He had been acting strange, skittish, like he constantly thought he was being followed. Neither me nor Mom could understand why, and he was more distant from us, closed off with us, than usual. Dad had always been a bit unspoken and reserved, sure (and now I may understand a bit better as to why), but he was all but shutting us out for most of the week leading up to his disappearance.\n\nI understand if anything you've just read seems unbelievable. Trust me, I thought the same thing at first. I honestly thought my father was suffering from some sort of psychosis, until I went searching through he and Mom's room, hoping to find some sort of clues, and found the old newspapers dating back to the early nineties regarding the old neighborhood and the cemetery. This letter was found taped over one of the first reports of the murders Dad mentioned, titled **\"The Damnation of Hallowed Stone\"**.\n\nWherever he is now, I hope he's okay. I'm still not sure of some of the more speculative parts of his letter, but if half of what he wrote of was true, I hope he's able to make it out okay and come home again. I miss him and I'm scared. I'm scared even more so now for Mom.\n\nSee, another reason I'm typing this out for you all is because, to attest more to Dad's elegy, I, too saw a hooded figure, watching me. I can't be sure, but I think I could even hear it say something like *\"Come join us...\"*",

        "text": " \n\nThe United States is, no doubt, a diverse land of many different forms of life. From the fierce grizzly bears in the mountains of Alaska, to the stealthy alligators in the swamps of Florida. Wherever you may be, there is always something unique about your state. That is until you get to Oklahoma. You see, Oklahoma is without a doubt, one of the most boring places, maybe…ever. Having lived here for 18 years, I’ll be the first person to tell you that. Sure there are large cities, just like any other civilization, however they are spread out over tens, even hundreds of miles apart. What you are left with in between those cities is what some refer to as “The Sticks” or “The Boondocks” or “The Country” whatever you choose to call it, and that is where I’m from. In the sticks it consists of 4 main elements: Lots of trees, lots of crops, lots of wildlife, and the occasional Walmart or Dollar General. Since there is not a lot to do out here, that is where most Oklahoma residents take up the past time of hunting, and that is where my story begins. \n\nIt was a cold November night, right in the heart of deer season. I was laying in bed enjoying a video game I was playing, when there was a knock on my bedroom door. It opened, and my dad walked in. “Hey kid.” He said. “Yes dad?”. “You haven’t been hunting this season yet, why don’t you take my bow and I’ll get you set up, and in the morning you can head out there, and go kill us something.” “Wow he’s really putting me on the spot here.” I thought to myself. “Yeah sure, why not.” I said to him, He told me to dress warm and to meet him outside by the front door in 10 minutes so we could walk out to the spot, so I would know where to go when it was time to leave tomorrow. \n\nWe began our walk into the woods. With every step we took, I began to get a little bit more annoyed. “Where are we going?” I thought. “I thought we were just gonna go behind the house, I didn’t know we were gonna have to hike to the hunting spot.” “Damn what was I thinking, I should’ve just said no.” When we finally arrived at the hunting spot, we were more than a mile out into the wilderness behind my house. He finally stopped by a huge oak tree and pointed his flashlight at some cedar trees that were off to the side. “Do you see it?” he said. “No?’ I replied. He walked closer and shined his flashlight into the trees, to reveal a tiny chair that was hidden under some tree branches and sticks. “That is where you’re gonna set up in the morning, got that?” I nodded my head as he tossed out some dried corn, to attract the deer in the morning, when I came back. \n\n“What time do I need to head out here?” I asked my dad, expecting him to say 6 to 7AM. He then muttered “You need to be up and ready to head out by 4:00AM.” My heart sank, it was going to be pitch black outside. There’s no way I was going to be able to make it all the way out here in the pitch black. We finally made it back to the house by 11:30 and I headed up to my room, to get as much sleep as possible before this hunting trip.\n\nI awoke to the painful sound of my alarm blaring into my dark room. I looked at my phone and it was 3:40AM. I sighed and sat up. I put on the warmest clothes I could find and made my way out into the living room. There on the couch sat my dad’s bow, 2 arrows, and a small but sharp hunting knife. I grabbed the gear plus a flashlight and made my way out the front door. Navigating the woods at night was an extremely frightening experience that took much longer than what I would’ve wished. I left my house at 4am and I did not arrive at the hunting location until 4:37. I was impressed with just how many trees I managed to walk into and how many times I almost tripped over large logs, even with the help of my flashlight. Once I arrived I sat down in the little uncomfortable plastic chair and began waiting. My dad wanted me out here so early because it makes it a lot easier for the hunter to sneak into his spot and the deer not being able to watch him. I’ll never forget the paranoia I experienced in those woods, in the pitch black. The feeling of not wanting to breathe too loud because something or someone might hear you is like no other. After roughly 15 minutes of sitting in the quiet darkness, I heard it. Sticks snapping and leaves crunching. It was a deer walking to my spot! My heart began to pound as I listened closer. The leaves continued to crunch with each footstep, but that’s when I picked up on something strange. “I-is this thing walking on two legs?” I thought to myself. It sounded just like a pair of human legs walking through the leaves.\n\n“Is it my dad?” I thought. “Maybe I forgot something at the house. Surely it has to be him.” But no, it couldn’t have been him. The footsteps were coming from the woods, not the trail we walked. The footsteps emerged from the woods, and stopped. After a short pause it took one step towards me. A moment later it took one more step in my direction. I began to get nervous. “Deer shouldn’t be acting this way, what the hell is this thing?” I raised my flashlight up from my lap and in a moment of pure bravery and stupidity I clicked my flashlight on.\n\nWhat I saw in front of me, still haunts me to this very day. In front of me stood a creature no shorter than 10 feet tall. It stood on two legs. It was covered in black fur. The face..was human I believe. The face looked to be of a man’s face. The eyes were closed and the mouth was contorted into a sinister grin. It had two great big antlers that seemed to come off of an elk or a moose. It had hooves for feet and its arms were long and skinny but had what appeared to be claws on the end of its hands. As soon as I saw this thing, I clicked off my flashlight, praying it didn’t see me. Too late. I almost started gagging from fear when I heard this thing sprinting at me. \n\nAs fast as I could, I loaded an arrow and drew back the bow. Without hesitation I fired the bow into the darkness, hoping I could hit the creature, but I missed. I heard the arrow whistle off into the woods before striking a tree. “Shit. Stupid idea.” I thought. I immediately stood up and began sprinting down the trail. The creature was in close pursuit. I ran faster than I knew I could down this trail. When I was almost half way home I began to naturally run slower because of fatigue, and that’s when it swiped at me. It hit me directly in my right calf. I stumbled and fell off the trail and into a nearby ditch. Once I fell in I could immediately feel the warm blood begin to start gushing out of my leg. I quickly tore off my hoodie and wrapped it around my leg as a temporary tourniquet. However my bleeding leg was the least of my worries. \n\nThe creature jumped down into the ditch with great force and began swiping at the ground, hoping to hit me. Luckily the thing landed about 20 feet away from me so I had some time to spare. I hurriedly pulled out my flashlight and threw it behind the creature. Upon hearing the flashlight hit the leaves it turned around and began swiping at the ground once again. As quickly and quietly as possible, I crawled out of the ditch. On my way out, I heard the creature begin to make a clicking noise from its mouth. Now I can’t confirm it but I assumed that noise was the creature using echolocation to find me. “If this thing is blind how did it see my flashlight back at the hunting spot?” I thought. Then I realized I had to click my flashlight on, and the creature probably heard that. Despite now knowing it was using audio to track me, I still ran to the best of my ability out of the woods. The thing didn’t follow me out. I made it home and crashed through my front door, bleeding all over the place. My parents took me to the ER to get stitched up. They asked me what happened and I told them what happened, but of course they didn’t believe me. They assumed I fell while walking through the woods and tore open my leg somehow. And after a while I began to think the same thing. “Maybe I was sleepwalking and fell, maybe I was hallucinating, who knows.” is what I used to tell myself. \n\nI almost forgot about my experience until today. My dad went out hunting and was supposed to be back 3 hours ago, me and my mother began to get worried. I walked out my front door, I planned on going to look for my dad and that's when I heard it. Screaming. I don’t know if it was my dad’s or if it was just a wild animal but we called the police anyway..And as I type this, I can hear a faint clicking out by the woods and if I look hard enough, I think I can make out a human face, looking up at my window. Please, if you are ever in the forests of Oklahoma, be extra quiet. You never know who or what is going to hear you.",

        "text": " Since I was young, strange things have been following me. It has not been easy to come out and talk about them due to their nature and worry of judgment. I haven't been able to find a reliable outlet to speak to when it comes to them, but someone recently told me about this site, and now is as good of a time as any. I am still figuring out these things, but I will call them shadows for convenience. When I say they are strange, I would love to point out that I am generous with my wording.\n\n I was about ten years old when I first encountered a shadow. On a hot summer's day in the middle of august, my family decided to go for a picnic. At the time, there were five of us: My Mother, Father, and my two sisters. They had packed a ton of food and decided our picnic place would be in the park. \n\n I was personally excited. We hadn't done much as a family since mom was always working, so I was a kid with his shoes on fifteen minutes before we were ready to go. My sisters didn't share the same love since they were honestly a little bit spoiled, but it was of no consequence to me. We had gotten everything packed up and put in the van, driving to the local park as I had the biggest smile on my face.\n\n When we got there, we walked a bit and found the perfect spot. They set out the blanket and bag, and we all sat down as a family for the first time in months. They pulled out the sandwiches and passed them around, and I remember eating, feeling the happiest I have ever felt. I remember that day so well—the good and the bad, but most of all, the boy.\n\n Once I finished my sandwich, feeling pretty satisfied since I had finished before my sisters, I felt odd. Something was bugging me, and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. I started looking around, feeling a bit cold as I examined my environment, before seeing something off-putting at the base of the hill we had set up on.\n\n It was a young boy, maybe about my age. He was about as tall as me and seemed to watch us eat curiously. I couldn't quite make out his face at first, so I waved at him while smiling as I looked at a potential friend. He waved back, lifting his head and revealing more of his face. I cannot stress this enough, but when he lifted his head, it felt like time had stopped for a moment, allowing me time to register his face.\n\n It was me.\n\nWell, it was me, but he also looked different. Even though he mainly wore the same things as me, his shirt had a few more rips and wrinkles than mine. He also had pure white eyes that continued to stare at me as his mouth formed some twisted grin that could be compared to the look you give when you'd stub your toe, smiling instead of scowling through the pain. It was horrifying and scared the shit out of me then, and that was before he started sprinting up the hill at me.\n\n I jumped backwards and fell on top of the picnic and the contents of the blanket, screaming and sobbing in absolute fear. The kid ran up to the top quickly, being closer and showing what he looked like more clearly. He resembled me but had sharp teeth, looking like a demon child you would see in horror movies. He seemed partially melted and malleable as he ran up to me, stopping a foot away and staring straight down at me.\n\n We kept eye contact as I tried to back away, but my body stopped responding to the commands I was giving. Suddenly, it crouched down and was a foot away from my face, smiling and breathing heavily. I had tears streaking down my face, sobbing and crying hard as I yelled at it to go away. \n\n After the moment passed, it let out a coarse yet harsh scream, yelling directly at me and hitting me with some saliva before disappearing into thin air. I curled into a ball as I sobbed, freaking out as my mother was holding me and crying herself, but not for the same reason I was. \n\n I found out a few moments later what my parents were seeing. They were watching me scramble back, freaking out and sobbing. My dad being the father he is tried to hold me and calm me down. When he touched me, I twisted and swung my hands up at him, hitting his neck with a knife that had appeared in my hand, ultimately slitting his throat. Mom was holding his head on her lap as she called the police, trying to stop the bleeding and rubbing my shoulder, sobbing loudly.\n\n My dad didn't make it to the hospital. He died at the picnic, and it was all my fault. I didn't even know what happened and still feel confused about the entire situation. I remember an ambulance coming and picking him up, driving him away as the police approached my mother, and then me.\n\n I was a kid, so when I was brought in, the police asked me where I got the knife. I didn't know, so I responded accordingly. I told them my entire side of the story, which led me to get a psych evaluation on me, which responded clear, showing I wasn't schizophrenic. The psychologists expressed nothing made sense, so I insisted it was my friend to no avail.\n\n Time went by as my friend showed up more and more. He would come during meals and smile at me from the corner or during walks and stand on the other side of the street. Over and over and over, he did this so many times. Thankfully, he was never as bad as the first time, so I considered myself lucky.\n\n And that brings us to tonight. I am writing this, still shaking and terrified, as five bodies are now in my room. I had an encounter with the shadow earlier, but this was the first time he ran at me in decades, being older and so much faster. I blacked out this time, walking home from work, and I lost about five hours. So here I sit for the final time, a handwritten note from ME saying I killed them (which I didn't) and a revolver to the right of my laptop. \n\n My name is Nathan, and I am 55. The odds of anyone believing my words are immeasurably low, so I quit. I am taking matters into my own hands tonight and plan to end this torture altogether. I hope this finds you well. I love you, mom. I love you, Clair and Millie. But no one will believe me.\n\nGoodbye.",

        "text": "Once, I actually was a pretty normal human, I had dreams, future plans and a fiance, I was young. Nineteen years old, fresh out of high school, and had plans to go to college and move in with my now dead wife. Now, nearly 34 years later, i'm a completely different person. It really all started back in my home town of Whipster, Oregon. I was 18 years old about to graduate high school, I was still living with my parents until my house was done being built so I could live with my at the time girlfriend. \n\nI was interested in joining the military but I was mainly interested in guns, that was going to be my major in college, ballistics, and developing new kinds of assault rifles. After a long debate and argument with my girlfriend and parents I was going to join the armed forces, or as they called it, \"Special Armed Military Tactical Team.\" I didn't really know what they meant by \"special\" but my young mind was ready. Man I wish I listened to my parents and my gut feeling and never thought about joining this unit for the government. Worst decision I ever made, but, maybe I was meant for this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did need the money to pay for college and pay off the rest of the house, they were willing to pay a lot more money for this special unit than regular armed forces. The very first day of training was absolutely horrible, to say the least. It was in the middle of nowhere in Arizona, right in the middle of a desert. They said this kind of training was absolutely needed for this job, and that training in the desert was perfect. It was pretty normal in 105 degree weather, except when we got to the shooting range, instead of there being normal human cardboard people to shoot at, they were these massive plastic and cardboard representations of creatures I have never seen before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were 330 of us, split into groups of 10 for training, the training would last about 15 weeks, which I found extremely odd as you would normally go through six weeks of training for a military job.  Instead of getting easier, the training got progressively harder as the days went on. The cardboard creatures were also getting more and more deformed and terrifying. We also weren't allowed to tell anyone about our training or really just the job in general, really all we could tell was our family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of training was hard, but it wasn't nothing we couldn't handle, but the last few weeks were the worst. After week ten we started practicing our aim on moving life animals, honestly I wouldn't even call them animals. They are some deformed mutated creatures, not even like they were from this world. After the first day of training with those things about 21 people quit the training over being traumatized about killing those monsters, really it's the only word I could use to describe them. They ranged from dog sized to human sized, some of them didn't even have eyes and would move around until it was shot by one of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat really made people quit though was we had to practice with this shape-shifter, the creatures would turn into our beloved family and friends, which was part of the training. To become desensitized toward the creatures, and not fall for their tricks. After week ten was over I started to make new friends, one of them named Bobby, an amazing person, we became best friends overnight and now he's really the only one I trust at this place, or so i thought.\n\nWeek eleven and twelve were okay, I met two guys Conner and Moses, they were both brothers, so, me, Bobby, Conner and Moses very quickly bonded and we all became best friends. When we went into week thirteen all of us thought we were ready for anything they would throw at us after going through all that. obviously, We were not prepared, honestly, no one from this planet would be prepared for these last few weeks of training we had ahead of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoses had told me after week twelve, the real training started. We stopped doing cardio exercises all together and focused on shape-shifter training. After that we started using these super high tech guns. I have never seen any kind of weaponry like this, ever. this one gun was huge, it was almost two AK-47s put together, it also didn't shoot bullets, it shot these electrcial balls of pure energy, and don't even get me started on the recoil and kick these fuckers had. After shooting it once everyone could barely move their arm. Allison, one of our commanders shot it without experiencing too much pain to show it can be used without breaking your shoulder, the gun was called the quantum rail gun. My question was, what kind of creatures would need this powerful of a gun to be killed?\n\nWeek thirteen and fourteen mainly consisted of using that gun, and doing shape-shifter training. week fifteen though, i'll never forget this week, It was one of the most difficult and horrifying training i'd ever went through, the first day, they brought these giant humanoid creatures and we had to kill them before they got to us. The next three days after that they made us shoot the quantum rail gun three times an hour for the whole day. The last days were the worst, They put us in this room with this eight foot tall creature and we had to kill it before it killed us. Honestly out of the hundreds of thoughts about quitting this program this time was the closest.\n\nThat thing, was horrifying, the arms were the size of two people put together and it was only eight feet tall so its arms had to drag across the floor when it wasn't trying to claw my eyes out. It's head was so long it could barely keep it straight. The last day was the worst, I had to kill one more of those creatures in that room all alone to finish the day, I was handed a quantum rail gun and placed in the room. It immediately charged at me and I fired the gun but that damn recoil was so bad it barely got the top of its head. Green Juice splashed everywhere but it was coming toward me I only had a quantum rail gun and nothing else to use, I tried to dodge its arms but it got a hold of me, still spewing green.\n\nIt was just about to rip me apart until Allison blew it's head off, I dropped to the ground, absolutely paralyzed from fear of almost getting killed by one of those things, everyone else seemed pretty calm, might be because we was all shocked about what just happened. Eventually I got patched up, and the fifteen week training course was over, after 2 weeks they would cut most people and it would go down to 150. the selected people would then go on to two more weeks of specialized training and at that point after the two weeks there would only be 100 people left. I was honestly hoping they wouldn't pick me but I had two more weeks to go home and clear my mind of everything for now.\n\nI will update y'all on my adventures I once had, but this part was only for training, part two will be about the actual job, I would rather call it hell, but, I better get off here for now.",

        "text": "The darkness that gripped me along with the [hands at my throat](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ityka/oasis_in_the_dark_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) gave way to a shifting, black fog. I found myself standing in its midst, even the ground veiled by its shadows; I couldn’t see my feet. It was like I was in a void, somewhere beyond the edge of space and time.\n\nYou know, for someone who’s been in the fog between dimensions countless times, it really shouldn’t have freaked me out. But somehow, this was way, way worse.\n\nI cursed. It echoed. \n\nSecond try. “Anyone out there?” I shouted into the rolling fog.\n\nI didn’t really expect a response, but I got one. A shape was taking form ahead of me, still shrouded in shadow, though its outline seemed vaguely humanoid. I squinted and stepped closer, trying to make out its details. \n\n“Hello?” I called. “Can you hear me?” Unease prickled down my spine as my words turned into echoing whispers, vanishing into the darkness.\n\nBut suddenly eyes blinked into being, shockingly human in everything but the color: as silver as the blade of a knife. As they stared into my brown ones, I found myself drawn to them like a moth to a flame. I couldn’t tell you why; they just…called to me. I stepped forward, barely aware that I was doing it. “What are you?” The words were hardly a whisper, but even they echoed.\n\nAnother step. I reached my hand out on instinct, and I swear I saw a shadow move below its eyes, as if it, too, were reaching out for me.\n\nBut the illusion of connection, of calm, was shattered as quickly as it had appeared, because with a flash of color, something else moved in the fog to my right, and the silver eyes vanished immediately. I wanted to tell them to come back, but something told me to be stay silent. Whatever was out there gave me a sick feeling in my gut, and I was pretty sure I didn’t want it to know I was here.\n\nI reached down slowly, hoping my movements were blocked by the fog, and grabbed the pistol at my belt, keeping it pointed at the ground but carefully switching the safety off. The whole time, I kept my eyes trained on the barely-perceptible movements to my right, sure that if I looked away, I wouldn’t be able to pick them out again.\n\nI crept forward towards the motion, raising the pistol as I did. The thing in the shadows was moving closer, too, I thought, though it was so hard to tell for sure. I wondered if it had seen me move. I stopped.\n\nSquinting, pistol pointed at the shifting shadows, I could have sworn I saw it lunge toward me. \n\nNo time to think. Instinctively, I fired. The thing shouted wordlessly in pain—it sounded relatively human—but it also kept coming, and before I could move, it threw itself at me, and I fell backwards.\n\nThe only reason I’d believed there was a ground at all in this void was because I’d been standing on a solid surface earlier; the fog hid any details. Now, though, I could confirm that there was indeed a solid ground, if only because it knocked the breath out of me as I collided with it. \n\nThe thing followed, pinning me to the dark, hidden ground. I only caught glimpses of it in the shadows. We rolled over each other—I felt skin, and hair—and something about the brief flashes I saw in the black fog seemed oddly familiar, but my brain couldn’t seem to piece it together, as it were a puzzle made entirely of corner pieces—\n\nAnd as I wrestled with my attacker, scrabbling to tug at its hair or punch any part of it I could reach, I felt a wet liquid drip onto my jacket—maybe I’d managed to shoot it—and then there was pressure at my throat, maybe hands, I couldn’t tell, and I found myself thinking, *Really, twice in a row?!* \n\nFor the second time in like ten minutes, I felt lightheaded, and my vision might have blackening too, but it was impossible to notice any difference when we were already in a dark void of nothingness. But even as I lost consciousness *again,* I could have sworn I felt something slip into my pocket.\n\nAaaand then I woke up on the ground with one hell of a headache. It took a second for everything to come back to me: Asher’s town, hands at my neck, dark fog, more strangling. Maybe I should have been more concerned, but my head felt like it was full of cotton, and it was all I could do to lie there and groan. Instinctively I reached for my throat, wincing as I touched the tender skin there. *Come on, brain, why’d you have to dream about getting choked immediately after we already got choked? I didn’t need to experience that twice! Not cool.* \n\n“You’re alive!” Asher was leaning over me, looking immensely relieved and also…amazed? Something like admiration glinted in his dark eyes, which didn’t seem entirely earned, since all I’d done was manage to pass out rather than stop breathing permanently. Oh, and pass out *again* while in whatever dreamworld I’d visited during my little nap. Maybe he was just amazed I’d survived, considering my less-than-stellar track record of nearly dying.\n\nThe dream was already fading; it had seemed so real in the moment, like dreams often do, but now it was slipping away fast. The real world was coming back to me. As I slowly sat up, I realized there was another guy nearby; I caught sight of him sitting against a tree trunk five feet away, tied to it with thick, thorny ropes. Even with a headache, it didn’t take much to put two and two together. “No thanks to him,” I muttered as Asher helped me up.\n\nAsher shot a glare in the guy’s direction. “Yeah. I’m so, so sorry about that. We don’t get a lot of visitors, and he kind of freaked out. He’ll be dealt with.”\n\nI eyed the ropes, which were drawing beads of black blood where they cut into the guy’s skin. “I can see that,” I said warily. “Look, it’s really not a big deal. I’ve almost died *so* many times over the years. Hell, this isn’t even the first time I’ve nearly been strangled, believe it or not.”\n\n“No, you don’t understand how serious it was,” Asher insisted in frustration. “He should’ve—”\n\n“Asher, I think we should get your…*friend* inside,” cut in a new, unfamiliar voice. “After that display, it’s probably best not to parade him around out here.”\n\nApparently all of Asher’s people—whatever they were—moved as quickly and quietly as he did, because suddenly there was the owner of the voice, leaning against a tree directly ahead of us. She looked a lot like Asher, and I don’t just mean her ghostly skin and dark, braided hair. They shared a lot of features, too: similar noses, heart-shaped faces. She looked a bit older than us, maybe mid-twenties. I wondered if they were related.\n\nAsher nodded and gestured for me to follow. “Do you need help walking?” he asked quietly.\n\n“No,” I said indignantly, trying to hide how my knees wobbled with my first steps. “I’m fine.”\n\nAsher rolled his eyes. “Of *course* you’re fine, I should have known,” he said. “Come on.”\n\nLuckily, after a few steps, I really was fine. Would’ve been super embarrassing to face plant immediately. I hurried after Asher and the woman, following them down a winding, barely-discernable path between thick trees, their branches crisscrossed overhead. We passed several houses built into the trunks before the woman turned off and headed for the front door of one.\n\nThis house was small, constructed around one of the trees, as if it were a donut and the tree was filling in its center hole. It was made entirely of black wood, like the others, with a symbol I didn’t recognize carved into the door and a set of what looked like homemade windchimes hanging from one of the branches over its roof. They jingled quietly in the breeze.\n\nThe woman opened the door and ushered us inside. I felt her eyes on me even as she closed it behind us, though I tried to ignore it and focus on the house instead.\n\nIt was surprisingly nice. Simple, for sure, but they’d made it cozy with what they had. A little living room area to my right, kitchen to my left, and a winding wooden staircase wrapped around the tree trunk that presumably led to bedrooms upstairs. Across from the couch, where I’d normally expect a television or a fireplace, was some kind of altar: glossy and black, covered in candles and ash and books with runes on their covers. I didn’t want to look too closely. Everything in the house was black, of course, though I presumed they didn’t have much choice based on the available environmental materials.\n\nAsher gestured for me to sit. Hesitantly, I took one side of the couch. He perched on its other arm, feet on the cushion beside me, and the woman settled into the chair across from us. \n\n“So, who *is* your friend, Asher?” she asked pointedly, eyebrows raised as she looked at me. “Not the usual type around these parts.”\n\nThat was a polite way of saying I was weird and she wanted to know what the hell I was doing here. I’d tiptoed around enough inhuman beings, careful to say the nicer version of things, to recognize it being done to me. “I’m Ian,” I said before he could answer. “I didn’t mean to make a scene.”\n\n“You didn’t make a scene,” said Asher heatedly. “Orion did.”\n\n“Well, regardless of the blame, it *was* quite the scene,” said the woman. “For several reasons.” *Several* reasons? More reasons than ‘the guy tried to kill me’? I opened my mouth to ask what she meant, but she continued smoothly. “I’m Acacia, by the way. Asher’s sister.”\n\nThey *were* related! I didn’t respond right away, mostly due to my slow processing of her words—my head was still working on clearing out the cotton—and she must have taken this as surprise, because she gave me a small smile and continued, “It’s okay, I’m sure Asher didn’t tell you about me. If it makes you feel better, he didn’t mention *you* either.” She was glaring at him now, though it was more teasing than venomous. Asher held his hands up in surrender, smirking.\n\n“He didn’t,” I finally said. “Mention you, I mean. But it’s nice to meet you.” I didn’t really know what else to say. Now that my head was clearing and I was thinking more about the town—what had Asher called it? Oasis? — it was seeming weirder and weirder. All my life I’d thought only monsters lived in the dark parts of Neverland, the most inhuman, murderous beasts in existence. But here was an entire civilization of human-like beings, who, dare I say it, seemed mostly peaceful. Well, except Orion. N0mvbg…\n\nI just hope that isn’t written on my headstone after this proves out to be an elaborate method of toying with their prey. *Ian Griffin,* it would read, *Most gullible, attack-prone being to ever grace either dimension.*\n\nWhat an honor.\n\nBut something in me was insisting I could trust them, Asher and his sister. Sure, that guy had tried to kill me, but they’d been more horrified by it than I was. And say what you will about my common sense, but my instincts aren’t half bad.\n\nSo I said, “I told Asher already, I have a few problems, and I’m hoping you can help.”\n\nAcacia raised her eyebrows. “Really? You don’t have someone else to turn to?” She leaned forward as if letting me in on a secret. “Do you even know what we are?”\n\n“I don’t think he’d wander into the forest looking for me if he had a better option,” said Asher pointedly. Though I met Acacia’s eyes and longed to press her last point—because I *was* desperately curious—I swallowed my eager questions. Not the time. There were more important things.\n\nAcacia sighed and got to her feet. “Alright, go for it. We don’t have anything to lose. You want tea?”\n\nShe’d caught me off-guard. “What?” \n\n“Tea. You *have* heard of tea before, haven’t you?” She was already setting a kettle on the stove, but she twisted her head to smirk at me, and that smirk made her look more like Asher than ever. “Or did you think we just drank blood or something?”\n\nYet again, I found myself afraid of offending them. At the same time, though, both she and Asher were watching me with mischievous glints in their dark eyes. Surely it was okay if I didn’t tiptoe around during the entire conversation? “I mean, you look a little friendlier than most things I’ve encountered in the forest, but I still kind of assumed you were carnivorous. Totally on board if I *don’t* look tasty, though.”\n\nAsher and his sister looked at each other for a long moment and then burst out laughing. “You don’t look at all appetizing,” Acacia assured me.\n\n“I’d rather eat the table,” Asher added helpfully. \n\nThe *table?* Okay, maybe I should be offended. Surely I was more appealing than a *table.* \n\nNot the point. As the kettle began to whistle, I took a deep breath and said, “Someone’s murdering inhuman beings.”\n\nThe kettle crashed to the floor as Acacia dropped it in shock; I winced as hot droplets of water splashed onto my skin. *“What?”*\n\n“I know it’s not something that happens,” I said. “But it’s happening now. I wouldn’t make this up, and I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t scared.”\n\nAcacia left the kettle on the floor and slowly came to sit with us. Asher had tilted his head, any surprise replaced with thoughtfulness as he looked at me. “I don’t doubt that you’re telling the truth,” he said. “But why would you think that *we* could help?”\n\nI sighed. Now for the awkward part. “Well…you reappeared to me after ten years right around the time they started. I don’t know, I guess I just hoped those two things were connected somehow.”\n\nHe raised his eyebrows. “That’s the biggest jump to a conclusion I’ve ever heard. Not even just a jump. You leapt off the cliff of conclusions.”\n\nI stared at the dark floor of their house. “Yeah,” I said quietly. “I know. I think I *wanted* it to be that easy. And, if I’m honest…I think I just wanted to talk to you more too. I was really curious about you.”\n\nThis time, there was a long moment of silence, broken only by our shallow breathing. I didn’t want to look up, afraid of the reactions I might see.\n\nBut then Asher broke out laughing. Surprised, I raised my eyes to find that he was laughing enough that he’d slipped off the arm of the couch and slid onto the cushion beside me. As he calmed down, his grin remained. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to laugh,” he said, still chuckling. “Honestly, I’m flattered.”\n\nAcacia had a small smile, too. “Like we said earlier, we don’t get a lot of visitors,” she explained. “Or friends, for that matter.” A pause. “But unfortunately, we can’t help you. We didn’t even know about the murders until you mentioned them. One question, though…these murders…how are they killed?”\n\nSomething prickled at the back of my brain, like my mind knew her words *should* have triggered some connection there but hadn’t succeeded in putting it together. I shrugged. “It varies. Knives, gunshots, crucifixion. Surprisingly human methods, really. Oh! Speaking of, I think the same killer murdered a human priest, in their dimension.”\n\nAcacia had looked relieved when I’d explained the methods of killing—I wondered what that was about, and *really* felt I should be putting two and two together right about now—but both her and Asher returned to shock at my last addition. I couldn’t blame them; they’d probably never heard of someone crossing dimensions. *Tread carefully.* It’d be all too easy to accidentally reveal that I did the same.\n\nAsher recovered quicker. He leaned back and whistled. “Both dimensions, huh? Maybe we *can* help, or at least try to.”\n\nAcacia shot him a warning look. “Asher. That’s a lost cause.”\n\nMy heart was suddenly racing in anticipation. “What is?”\n\nAsher leaned forward, eyes glinting. “The Ancient One.”\n\n“The Ancient One,” I repeated, letting my gaze drift to the altar a few feet away. Surely that had to be who it was set up for. “No offense, but who—or what—is that?”\n\nAcacia sighed. “A myth created to inspire and guide our people. But that’s all it is: a myth.”\n\n“Supposedly,” corrected Asher. “Of course, it’s assumed a myth because no one alive has ever met it. No one alive has met God, either, but people believe in Him.”\n\nI was intrigued. Look, I know better than anyone that myths can be real. Most of my *life* seems like a dark version of a fairy tale. Even if Acacia seemed doubtful, I wasn’t ready to brush Asher’s words aside. Not yet, anyway.\n\nAsher produced a gray piece of paper and charcoal pencil from somewhere, placing it on his knee. In two quick strokes, he drew a plus sign. Then he kept going, adding words at the end of each of the four lines. As he flipped it around for me to see, I realized that it wasn’t a plus sign; it was a set of axes. \n\nLeft to right, the two ends were labeled *Inhuman* and *Human.* Top to bottom, the ends were labeled *Alive* and *Dead.* Asher traced the pencil’s tip over the horizontal line, from *Inhuman* to *Human.* “Think of the planes of existence like this,” he said. “One axis encompasses the two dimensions that exist side by side: the inhuman and the human. No one can cross over and exist on both sides of the dividing axis in the middle.” He pointed to the vertical line. *Except me,* I wanted to say, biting my tongue to stay quiet.\n\nNow he dragged his pencil along that vertical line, from *Alive* to *Dead.* “The other axis is the plane of life and death. Most beings only exist on one side. But some cross over. Like vampires; they exist right here.” He placed his pencil tip in the lower left quadrant, close to the horizontal axis. “Inhuman, now dead, but *undead.* Still near the boundary to *Alive.*” He paused, then took the pencil and dragged it along the vertical line again. “And my kind. We exist on this whole line. We have a certain…connection to the dead.”\n\nMy mind was spinning wildly, trying to process everything I was learning. Did Henri know this? Should I have heard about this concept before? I had to admit, it made sense. Of course, it also lent itself to countless more questions about Asher—and about me. If his kind existed on the vertical line, able to cross over between *Alive* and *Dead*—whatever that actually meant—I think I would exist on the entirety of the horizontal one: *Inhuman* and *Human.* Present in both dimensions. Even if Asher had said no one did.\n\n*I* did.\n\nI was torn between burning curiosity over my own identity and whether this was some form of an answer, and between letting Asher continue to reach his point. With a great deal of effort, I chose the latter, literally biting my cheek to keep myself from interrupting. Coppery blood welled in my mouth.\n\nAsher didn’t notice. Now, he placed the tip of his pencil on the center: the tiny point where all four axes met in the middle. “The Ancient One,” he said in a low voice, “is said to exist here. All planes, all dimensions, able to cast its consciousness anywhere but physically trapped in one singular location. Mentally strong, physically weak. A balance, like everything.”\n\n“Our people used to pray to the Ancient One,” added Acacia. “But its existence has never been proven, and after some…tumultuous events in our history, many of us turned away from our faith.”\n\n“But some of us haven’t,” insisted Asher. “And if it *does* exist, it probably has all the answers you need! It must. It would have to know if someone was crossing dimensions.”\n\nAgain, I was torn, though now it was between excitement at a possible lead and panic at the thought of some ancient being knowing I was breaking dimensional laws. Would it smite me on the spot? I cursed mentally. \n\nI didn’t realize I’d been sitting there in silence, lost in my whirlwind of fear and hope, until Asher cleared his throat. “So? What do you think?”\n\nI tried to talk, and all that came out was a strangled noise. I coughed and tried again. “It’s worth a shot,” I said. “But first we need to go to [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/). My uncle might know something that could help us find the Ancient One.”\n\nAcacia and Asher were both looking at me with furrowed brows. “What’s Griffin’s Edge?” they asked, nearly simultaneously. \n\n“It’s a bar that my uncle owns—he’s a griffin, hence the name—it’s on the edge of dimensions—” I was searching for any spark of recognition, but their faces remained blank. I guess I should have known, if they never left the forest. “Doesn’t matter. You’ll see when we get there.”\n\nI reached out and grabbed Asher by the sleeve. He looked at me in panic. “I can’t.”\n\nI dropped my arm. “Oh…are you bound to the forest somehow? Maybe I can convince Henri to come here…” I didn’t think he would, but you never know.\n\n“No,” said Asher. “I just…don’t think it’s a good idea for me to be there.”\n\nI laughed. “Don’t worry, they’re friendly! We welcome anyone who obeys the rules. And if anyone has answers, it’ll be Henri and his buddies. They just needed a lead, and now maybe we have one! Come *on!*” \n\nI grabbed his sleeve again. And maybe because I was too focused on convincing him to come, maybe because the fear and excitement crowded into my head were overwhelming—whatever the reason, I didn’t notice the sneeze coming quick enough to stop it.\n\nSo that’s right: still holding his arm, I sneezed *violently,* and suddenly we were no longer in Asher’s house in the dark forest with Acacia. We were on a ledge *on the side of a skyscraper* in an unfamiliar city. Oh, yeah, and did I mention it was in the human dimension? While I held onto a very-much-not-human companion?\n\nClassic me. Thanks, atoms. So much for not mentioning my dimension-hopping to Asher.\n\nAsher, who, by the way, was turning a gray color that matched his name and hyperventilating. “I—assume—this isn’t—your uncle’s—bar,” he huffed out between gasping breaths. “I feel—sick. Also—I don’t think I—mentioned this—but—I’m terrified—of heights.”\n\nI looked at the narrow ledge beneath our feet and the busy city street below. We were at least ten floors up. “You *sit* in *trees!”* I shouted, already desperately feeling for a gap. \n\n“Trees—aren’t—this high,” he argued, still breathing like he was having a panic attack.\n\nNo gaps, and I couldn’t move off this ledge to find one. One step, and we’d be freefalling to the pavement. Which would really suck when I had finally been getting some potential leads about the murders and myself. \n\n*Deep breaths, Ian.* I knew how to do this. I just had to focus. I closed my eyes and felt the fabric around me, trying to block out Asher’s increasingly-desperate breaths.\n\n*Please,* I sent out as a silent prayer. And I guess reality was feeling generous, because there was a gap! Right ahead of us, one step off the ledge. We’d have to step into air, but the door would catch us. I pulled on Asher’s arm, pointing to the shimmering tear. “Come on, we have to step.”\n\n“ARE—YOU—SERIOUS,” he spit out, as much a shout as he could muster between his ashen cheeks and hyperventilating. “You—want me—to step off—a building?!”\n\nHe was trembling now. Even his hands were gray. Getting closer to combustion. I didn’t have time for this. I’d put him here, and now I had to make sure he didn’t die here.\n\n“I don’t want you to, you *are!”* I corrected, stepping off before I could think twice, pulling him as hard as I could behind me.\n\nThere was a tiny moment where the world seemed to drop out from under us, where my heart plummeted as I thought I’d felt wrong—but then we were passing through the usual fog, and half a second later we were standing on the path outside Griffin’s Edge.\n\nI breathed an enormous sigh of relief, dropping my hand from Asher’s arm. He looked instantly better, his skin returning to its ghostly paleness, his breathing slowing. He raised his eyebrows. “I don’t suppose that’s why you were biting a hole in your cheek during my description of the planes?”\n\nHe *had* noticed. Yikes. \n\nI opened my mouth to reply and try to explain, but I didn’t get a chance, because out of nowhere came Henri’s booming voice. I’ve said before that he never yells; when he’s angry, it’s obvious in his dangerously quiet words and disappointed stares. Now, though—now he was yelling. He sounded more furious than I’d ever heard him…and he was marching towards us.\n\n“IAN!” he bellowed. “DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU’VE BROUGHT TO MY BAR?” He gestured at Asher, who was somehow looking defiant, bewildered, and ashamed all at once. “DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HE’S CAPABLE OF?”\n\nI’d never seen Henri like this: with a wild fury burning in his lilac eyes, his face twisted into hard lines. He’d never turned away anyone from the bar without a reason; he’d never discriminated against any patrons, even the unsavory types that other inhumans tended to steer clear of. He’d never raised his voice at me, either. I had no idea what to do.\n\nI sputtered for words, but it didn’t matter. Henri gripped both me and Asher by the jackets, pulling us behind him like we weighed nothing. Moving so fast we barely saw the bar, he dragged us inside, past the crowds of nervous visitors, up the narrow stairs, and didn’t stop until we were in his office, the lock clicking shut behind us. \n\nWithout a word, he stepped behind his desk, pulling a key out of his pocket for his bottom left drawer—the only drawer I’d never seen him open. He’d kept it locked my entire life. I still had no idea where this was going, and my heart felt like it might pound out of my ribcage, though whether in fear or something else entirely, I don’t know. Asher was just staring at Henri with wide eyes.\n\nHenri yanked open the now-unlocked drawer, slamming a photograph onto the desk. The wild fury had faded from his eyes, leaving an even worse look of quiet smoldering ferocity. He gestured for me to move forward to look at the photo.\n\nAsher stepped forward tentatively with me. My breath caught as I looked at the photo. I’d recognize the woman sprawled in the road anywhere; I’d grown up seeing her photos around Henri’s office, in his bedroom, over the bar. Henri’s late wife. But I’d never seen *this* photo before: in this one, she was dead. And there were no visible marks except ashen black handprints on her neck.\n\n“His kind is the reason Lucille is dead,” Henri said, voice hollow. He held up a small mirror, letting me see my own neck—where ashen black handprints stood out starkly, just like the ones in the photo. “And by the looks of it, you should be too.”",

        "text": "Getting so much [information from Koro](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10k0nbh/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_finally_got_some/) was exactly what I needed to form a plan, and I decided I had to act fast. I knew Corey would catch on to me sooner or later, and I didn’t want to find out what would happen when she did. My idea wasn’t perfect, but I thought it had a solid chance to work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEleanora goes back to her reality when she needs to recharge, and when we are there, our job is to fully clean and reorganize the store. Koro mentioned that the owner made a deal with Eleanora to keep her clean and organized (and inhabited, but honestly, I didn’t have any control over that). So, I put two and two together, and it seemed like the best way to trigger a trip to the other side would be to just make a huge mess. This would be rather hard to do, since I have a strong feeling Corey knows this as well, so I had to be careful about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a particularly slow day when I came in (on my *day off* I might add), so this felt like the perfect opportunity to do some… rearranging of the floor. I was working with Daniel and Corey, and they were busy in the back office talking numbers all day, so I took it upon myself to completely remove everything from the floor, pile all the clothes on the couch, and start moving furniture around. When they heard me dragging a heavy table across the floor, they came rushing out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What are you doing, Harper!?” he practically screamed, horrified. I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned this, but Daniel is a bit of a neat freak. He does *not* like anything cluttered, and if there’s a single shirt folded wrong in a stack, he’ll refold them all. He’s a perfectionist, if you will. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m just taking some initiative!” I said, trying to fake excitement. “I read last night about feng shui, and the layout here is not great-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Harper,” Daniel said, visibly trying not to freak out. “I appreciate your input regarding the layout of the floor, but you cannot just start moving everything around without discussing it with me first! You need to put everything back right now. We can talk about it tomorrow, and maybe I’ll take your ideas into consideration.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorey was smirking behind him, clearly enjoying seeing me getting in trouble for the first time. I tried my best to ignore it, but I felt embarrassment creeping into my cheeks. I generally pride myself on not causing issues at work, and being a problem solver that will fix anything that needs to be taken care of. But I knew this needed to be done, so I powered through the shame building in my stomach. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sorry, Daniel,” I started, before casually glancing at the clock. “Oh, but we close in 5 minutes, and we don’t have any appointments tonight. I can totally stay longer to clean this up, really, I don’t mind, but I think I’ll have to get overtime for that, and I know our budget is a bit limited right now…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel checked his watch and cursed under his breath. “No, it’s fine. Just head out now, we’ll deal with this tomorrow.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mumbled a quick apology before grabbing my bags and basically sprinting for the door. I caught Corey’s eye on the way out, and I could tell she was suspicious. I didn’t know if she caught on to my plan, but I couldn’t worry about that now. I got out of there as quickly as possible, and laid awake all night, anxious for the next day. I felt myself silently praying that it would work, while simultaneously hoping it didn’t. I keep finding myself hoping I’ll wake up and this will all be a horrible dream, and I’ll go back to work and everything will be normal. Corey would be gone, or better yet, just an obnoxious human rather than some supernatural being trying to control everyone’s mind, Eleanora will just be a name I’ve never heard before, and the biggest concern I’ll have is if the custom client of the night will get offended at the swatch I pick out for them. It isn’t the most *normal* normal, but it was a normal that I liked and now find myself missing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I showed up for work the next day, it seemed like my prayers had been answered, and my hopes crushed. Walking up the stairs, the light was flickering. I knew instantly we were going to be taken to Eleanora’s home. Giddy with nervousness, I opened the door to find all of my coworkers waiting for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey guys…” I said, seeing concern in Daniel and Patrick’s eyes. Sam looked more angry than anything else. I couldn’t help but notice that Corey was nowhere to be found, and I silently hoped she was gone for good. “What’s going on? Where’s Corey?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Harper, we wanted to talk to you. I asked her if she would come in a little late today so you would feel more comfortable opening up to us. You’ve been acting strangely the last few days, and we’re getting worried. Is everything okay?” Daniel started. I saw he and Patrick had that fog in their eyes, clearly still under some sort of control from Corey. I felt guilt stabbing into my stomach, and I desperately wished I could tell him everything, but I knew I couldn’t. I stood there, trying to think of anything that could explain my scattered behavior, when Patrick gave me the most perfect out I could ever ask for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You told me your cat has been sick, is this because of that?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory here, my cat is my everything. I rescued her when she was about 6 weeks old. She was found on the side of the road, covered head to tail in fleas, tummy full of worms, and barely moving. I spent 4 hours with her in my kitchen sink, tediously combing out all the fleas, and she didn’t complain once. When I took her to the emergency vet later that night, they warned me that she might not survive, since she was so malnourished and clearly did not get enough nutrients from her mother before she was abandoned, as she was the runt of the litter. But, when I looked into her little tiny blue eyes, I knew I would do anything I could to save her. So I stayed up all night with her at the vet, watching her breathe, and early in the morning, she lifted her head to me and meowed. She has been the light of my life since then, and now she is seven years old, extremely spoiled, and completely healthy. Of course, I couldn’t tell my concerned manager and coworker that. All they know is she is my baby, so I can see why they would assume the worst when I said she was sick. I quickly made a mental note to give her extra treats tonight to counteract what I was about to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes, she hasn’t been doing too great. I’m not sure why, but she’s been staying at the vet for the last few nights. That’s why I haven’t been sleeping well. I’m sorry for acting so weird, but once she is all fixed up, I’ll be back to normal, I swear.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnderstanding and sympathy flooded Daniel and Patrick’s eyes, and I swear Sam looked impressed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m so sorry to hear that, Harper. I completely understand, and it’s alright. Thank you for sharing that with us. It hasn’t helped that you’ve been working so hard, either. Why don’t you take the day off-” Daniel said, but quickly corrected himself. “Tomorrow. You can take tomorrow off. I’ll cover for you. Today… Well, you probably can tell.” He gave me a hug, and Patrick gave me an extra firm pat on the back. I smiled at them, trying not to show my excited nerves, and let Daniel walk me through what would be my section to clean. I caught Sam’s eye on the way to the back and gave him a cheeky wink, earning me an eye roll, but I could tell he didn’t think I could cover my tracks so well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we were walking to the back, I suddenly had a thought. “How does Corey get to this reality from ours?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel stopped, and I swear I saw the fog in his eyes clear for a moment, but it quickly returned, and he completely ignored my question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You can organize the swatches back here. When that’s done, you can give the bathroom a quick clean, and by then we should all be done. Is that alright?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sounds good!” I thought about pushing my question further, but I had bigger things to worry about. I had seen Sam slip past us into the break room, and I wanted to find out where he goes when he disappears. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Daniel walked back to the floor, I rushed into the break room, but Sam was already gone. “Where are you?” I whispered, looking up at the exposed air vents, trying to glimpse some movement, but there was nothing. “I’m going to do something you’ll think is stupid, so if you want a chance to stop me, now is the time.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard some rattling from the wall, and Sam came waltzing in from the office, shutting the door as he entered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What are you going to do?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m going to talk to Eleanora.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe laughed at me, loud. I felt my cheeks flushing once again. “And how do you think you’re going to do that?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“During my quiet time.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis face fell, and he got very serious. “Listen to me. Corey will be here, so you will not be doing that. If she catches a hint of what you’re doing, we’re all fucked. Don’t be stupid. Just do your fucking job and move on.” He turned to walk back out, when I saw him think of something, and he turned around, now angry. “Did you cause this? “\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This. Our *trip* to this god forsaken realm. Did you do this?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to steady my voice before replying. “That’s crazy, I don’t even know how to do that.” He didn’t seem convinced, but it didn’t matter, since Corey’s voice rang out just then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello everyone.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Whatever,” he spit, then disappeared into the office just as Corey walked back with coffee in one hand and her phone in the other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good morning,” she said numbly, not even looking up at me before walking into the office and sitting down, still on her phone. Sam was nowhere to be found, so I decided to move on. I had enough to worry about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did my tasks as fast as possible, hoping time would fly by, but I ended up finishing well before it was time for my five minutes. I sat in the break room, preparing myself for what was to come. My plan seemed simple enough; during my five minutes, I would talk. I would start by trying to talk to Eleanora, then to any spirits, then just to anything that would listen. I’d have to keep it quiet, but it was the only thing I could think of. I also decided, despite everything in my body telling me not to, that I would break the salt circle. I think this is what caused Meredith and Thomas to sound so far away and prevented them from seeing me, so if I wasn’t getting a response, I’d break down the barrier separating us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, it was time. We all met up on the floor (except for Sam of course), and Daniel set up the salt circle. Patrick went first, then Daniel. Sam appeared out of the break room for his five minutes after Daniel, and it was finally my turn. I took a deep breathe before standing up, preparing myself for anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Actually, Harper, you don’t have to do it this time,” Corey said, catching me off guard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What? What do you mean?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, since your *incident* last time, I believe it’s better if you sit this one out.” She smirked at me, and I realized she knew. She knew my plan, and was risking everything to stop it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“That’s against protocol, Corey,” Daniel started. “We’ve never excused someone from this before, and we don’t know what will happen to the barrier-“\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Stop.” She shot him a look, and he instantly froze, along with Patrick. They both sat down numbly, staring at nothing, and I heard Sam behind me backing away. She turned back to me, her face completely melted and that horrid scowl seemed to pulse out of her skin. She had me, I couldn’t look away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I know what your plan is, girl. You will not do this. I’ve worked too hard to make this business what it is, and you will not take it away from me. You will walk away today, go home, and forget about this. When you come back, you will return to business as usual, and you will drop this childish mission of yours. *Do I make myself clear*?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt felt like she was speaking inside my mind. I was shaking violently, and I nodded quickly. I watched as her face returned to normal, and she plastered the most disgusting, victorious smile on her face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m so glad to hear that! Oh, and Sam?” she said, looking past me, “if you try to mention this little *situation* to your friends here,” she motioned to Patrick and Daniel, who were still out of it, “I will find out, and I promise, you’ll be back at the warehouse in a snap. Got it? Now get out of here, both of you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFreed from Corey’s gaze, I turned to look at Sam, and saw true fear in his eyes. He nodded, before turning and heading for the door. I quickly followed, abandoning my bag and rushing to catch up with him. When he opened the door, we were back in our reality. However, the light was still flickering in the stairwell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“She doesn’t know what she just did,” he said quietly, and I could feel the anger boiling in his blood. “This is your fault. I told you to fucking let it go. Now, we’re all fucked.” With that, he walked out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt tears streaming down my face. I waited a moment before following him, as he clearly didn’t want to be around me. I had to walk home, since I left all my things in the office, but I think I needed the fresh air. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what to do. Eleanora is completely unbalanced now. Our barrier is broken. I don’t know what this means for the shop, or my coworkers, but I hope I have a shop to return to when I’m back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10j6j47/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_actually_made_my/)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10k0nbh/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_finally_got_some/)",

        "text": " \n\nI know that you may have read a title like that before. Maybe in an interview on a website run by conspiracy theorists. Maybe on a news report on some obscure station in a small town. But this? This is real. In September of 2005, my brother was 14 years old. He had turned 14 the month before. I was 12. I won’t lie to you and say that I was some hero who attempted to save him, or that we shared one final goodbye. I just woke up and he was missing. My mom was crying her eyes out while my dad contacted every phone number in the county. We turned the property upside down trying to find any possible clues towards his location, but found nothing. No note, no items, no footprints. You also may expect me to say that we magically located him, but no. In 2012, my brother was pronounced dead. I was 19 then. Since then, I moved out of our hometown, to a new place, a few miles out of Salt Lake City. I got a job working at a McDonald’s recently, and was on the night shift. We were just outside of the largest place in Utah, so naturally, we had very little activity. I was in the back, handling the drive-thru, while Tom, a co-worker, ran the registers. We also had a cook on shift who we rarely actually saw. We were making smalltalk because we all knew that there would likely be no customers during our shift, as it was 3:22 AM, and nobody was eating McDonald’s at 3:22 AM.  \n“So, Tom, where did you grow up?” I asked.  \n“Born and raised in Salt Lake City, moved out here to try and live on my own. What about you?”\n\nI paused. I somehow never thought about the question being reciprocated. I looked back at Tom, who had a questioning look on his face. My heart began to beat faster.  \n“I’d rather not talk about that.” I replied.\n\n“I see.” Tom says.\n\nI pull out my phone and open Facebook, to see what my friends and family have been up to.\n\nI see a post mentioning that it has been 17 years since my brother went missing. I decided that it would be a better idea to just finish my shift and go home. As expected, very little occurred that night at my shift. The same can’t be said for when I got home, though. By the time I had gotten home, it was 5:16. Of course, mail isn’t delivered that early, so I was confused to notice a small letter at my doorstep. I knew for a fact that there was no letter earlier that I missed. I picked it up and entered my house. I decided to get some rest before checking out the letter, so I went to sleep, and woke up around noon. After making myself lunch, I sat down to inspect the letter. It was someone dirty, and was hand written.\n\n“Dear \\_\\_\\_\\_, I know this may come as a surprise, but I am your brother. I had to leave the house because it wasn’t safe there. Not for me. You may wonder why it was safer for a 13 year old to be in the wild and not home, but that’s a long story. I would love to catch up with you whenever you have free time. Please come drop by at \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, Salt Lake City. Love, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_”  \nI couldn’t believe the words I was reading. Without a second thought, I grabbed my phone, charger, and got in my car. I began to drive towards the address outlined in the letter, and realized it was the more desolate and lesser populated part of the city. No matter. Eventually, I arrived at the address, being a smaller house that looked somewhat old. I admit that I may have been speeding, but in my defense, this was huge. I pulled into the empty driveway and got out. I went up to the door and knocked on it. No response. I tried again. Nothing. I got ready to try a third time when the door opened. There stood my brother, looking somewhat sickly. I hugged him without sharing any words. To skip the boring part, we caught up on the years he was gone, with him claiming to work at a Lowe’s in the area. I told him some rumors I heard about weird things happening there after hours, but he had no knowledge of what I was talking about. I brushed it off and we continued. He then informed me that he had forgotten to get something from the store, and told me to watch TV while he went to pick it up. I complied, and turned the TV on. As he walked down the sidewalk outside, I turned to the TV to see what was playing: a news report.\n\n“-citizens in the area claim that the shape-shifting creature mimicked a family member that was believed to be dead. They became suspicious when the ‘creature’ got smaller details wrong on the past of who it mimicked. The creature, if real, is believed to be in the Salt Lake City area.”  \nI stopped.  \nThe letter.\n\nI pulled it out of my back pocket and re-read it.  \n“You may wonder why it was safer for a ***13 year old*** to be in the wild and not home, but that’s a long story.”  \nHe wasn’t 13, he was 14.\n\nSuddenly, I heard keys jingling in the door. I quickly put the letter away and changed the channel.  \n“What’s up?” my “brother” asked\n\n“Hey.” I replied\n\nI had an idea. We used to have a secret handshake. He never forgot it then, even if we hadn’t done it in months. So, I tried it.\n\n“Hey, you remember our secret handshake, right?”\n\n“Uh.. Yeah.”  \n“Wanna try it again?”  \n“Sure.”\n\nI initiated the handshake, and just as I thought, he was clueless. I broke into a cold sweat. I told him that I had to use the bathroom, and he pointed towards it. I locked myself inside and began typing this. I’m currently in “his” house, and I still don’t know what to do. Maybe he just got the details wrong due to something happening while he was gone that traumatized him? I don’t know. But what I do know is that I’m terrified out of my life right now. What should I do?",

        "text": "Two months ago, I learned of my grandfather’s passing. We weren't particularly close but he left me his house in the will. It was a large manor with many rooms and hallways. I was touched but I just wanted to sell it off, I already had a house of my own much farther away and didn’t have any interest in moving. To speed up the process, I decided to travel across the country to live in the house until a sale was assured. My job just requires a laptop and phone so I was approved to work remotely for the time being. I got a real estate agent to take care of selling the house so that I could focus on my work and to make the process easier overall. The first day I got into the house I started to explore. The house looked quite large from the outside but when I was exploring the interior it seemed much bigger. It almost felt like there were an infinite number of rooms and hallways but in the end I just fell asleep in my grandfather's bedroom tired from jet lag. I eventually woke up far after morning with the sun beginning to set in the horizon. I was still tired but I felt a strong urge to leave the bedroom. The walls of the house made me sick from their ugly wallpaper. It was a dark gray color with the same weird black illustrations spaced out. The illustrations on the wallpaper had an uncanny feel to them. They looked like those weird inkblots that psychologists show people and it made me unexplainably anxious. With these illustrations on every wall it’s no wonder why I felt the urge to leave. The manor was nice but it kept me in a constant feeling of distress. The ugly wallpaper filled the walls and the small rooms made me feel claustrophobic. The hallways and corridors were narrow and long with dim lights that illuminated the hallways poorly. I felt terribly dehydrated when I woke up and needed to get to the kitchen for a drink. I escaped the confining bedroom and started to head down the equally cramped hallway. The hallway lights were off and darkness consumed the narrow corridor. The more I walked down the hallway the more I started to become nervous. Darkness surrounded me and I didn’t see any sign of a light switch. I eventually got anxious enough to pull out my phone and use it as a flashlight. The light shot out into the hallway but I still couldn’t see much of anything. The flashlight didn’t aid in the slightest but I still couldn’t bring myself to turn it off. The darkness of the corridor continued to weigh on me as I kept moving forward but the light gave me a sense of safety even if it was minuscule. As I continued to walk it didn’t take me long to realize something was wrong. I’ve been walking for too long. I have been walking for minutes now and I haven’t seen anything. I haven’t seen any doors, windows, or staircases. It was all just the same hallway with the same wallpaper that never ended. I gradually started to move faster and faster as a sense of dread started to sink in. The more I ran the more distressed I became. The hall kept going and going with no end. I knew that running wouldn’t get me anywhere but I couldn’t bring myself to stop. I knew I needed to do something other than just run. I looked at the phone that had been poorly lighting my way forward and a pronounced idea came to my mind. I should call the police. I thought to myself. They might not do much but it’s all my anxiety ridden mind could think of. I hammered the numbers into my phone with shaking hands. \nThe phone rang for a short while before I heard a feminine voice say \n“911 what’s your emergency.”\n“I…I’m trapped.” I said in a shaky voice\n“Are you in any immediate danger?”\n“No.”\n“Ok, what is your name sir?”\n“John…John Rorschach.”\n“How exactly are you trapped?”\n“I…don’t know.”\n“Could you describe your situation to the best of your ability?”\n“I’m…stuck in a hallway and I can’t get out.”\n“I don’t think I understand. Can you please explain in more detail?”\n“I’m walking in a hallway that doesn’t end! There’s nothing other than the walls and floor!”\n“Do you know where you ar-”\nAbruptly the call ended. I immediately looked at my phone and saw that it was dead. The light stopped and the darkness crept back in. I was so preoccupied with my situation that I didn’t notice my phone battery rapidly decreasing. What am I supposed to do now? I thought to myself. That was the only idea I had. Without knowing what to do I just kept walking. All I could see was the darkness surrounding me. I couldn’t see what was in front of me but I didn’t put my hands in front of me. I knew deep down that there wasn’t going to be anything ahead of me but more of the same repeating corridor. As I kept walking my anxiety turned to sorrow and misery. I felt my hunger and dehydration grow as I kept walking. What else could I do but walk? I asked myself. I had no answer and therefore I kept walking. I walked and walked and walked. Darkness was all that I saw for hours as I slowly walked down the hall. This was until I saw a slight gleam of light in the distance. I didn’t know if this was my imagination or not but it still gave me a slight glimmer of hope. I moved as fast as my exhausted legs could carry me towards the faint shimmering light. As I got closer I noticed the light was coming from a window. After what felt like an eternity I managed to get to the window at the end of the hall. I flung the window open and looked out to the world I hadn’t seen in hours. I saw that I was hauntingly high off the ground in the extraordinarily tall manor. I finally looked up at the moon in its beautiful light and for the first time since I started walking in that corridor I knew exactly what to do.",

        "text": "Trying to find a job in this economy is easy; trying to find a GOOD job is a task on the same level as a Labor of Hercules.\r\n\r\nAs a manager at a 24 hour restaurant (which shall remain unnamed), I get to see both sides of the struggle.  And let me tell you, it's exactly that: a struggle. I've seen desperate people interviewing for jobs that they were wholly over qualified for, homeless walking in off the streets who could cook better than a gourmet chef, and teenagers trying to help their struggling families by diving headfirst into a job they weren't prepared for. All that is to say that I've had a variety of interesting characters walk into my office for an interview.\r\n\r\nThe Host position, you would think, is one of the simplest ways to get your foot in the door at a new gig; not around here, though. The Host drives all of the day to day operations, so if the Host isn't right...everything crumbles like a castle of sand trying to stand against the force of the entire ocean. It sounds simple to stand around all day, seating patrons, handling out menus, and ordering drinks, but let me assure you that the position is high stress, meager thanks, and figuratively soul-sucking.\r\n\r\nMy restaurant has had a rather difficult time finding a Host that lasts longer than a week, perhaps a month, at best.  My District Manager suggested keeping up a permanent job listing on Craigslist, and that has kept a steady stream of hopeful applicants flowing. The problem: no matter how many interviews I've done over the past month (since our previous Host walked out on New Year's Eve), none of the applicants seemed quite right. From the doctor whose practice shuttered during the pandemic, to the 16 year old field hockey player with a limp...I've seen it all, and was disappointed in every single case.\r\n\r\nThe doctor ditched in the middle of a dinner rush after 4 days of employment, and the athlete...well, let's just say she cried all over the menus after an hour and wasn't seen again after her first shift as a Host.\r\n\r\nI was packing up my papers, ready to leave for the day, when a tiny knock at the office door pulled me from my thoughts. I had conducted 4 interviews already today, and, to be honest, didn't think that any of the new people would be worth hiring at all. The Vietnam vet with the missing arm had potential and a surprisingly cheery attitude, sure; the job would probably just chew him up and spit him back out worse than the government sending him to a jungle to fight a pointless war, however. Harsh, I know. But the truth is ugly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" I asked, a touch of annoyance in my voice. I dropped today's applications into the ever growing pile of rejects.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. (redacted)? I'm here for my interview.\"\r\n\r\nThe soft female voice coming through the door sounded...oddly familiar, somehow. I looked down at the 'IN' box on my desk and sighed. It was empty. I made a mental note to have a talk with my Assistant Manager tomorrow. \"Come in,\" I said, fingers tapping impatiently on my desk.\r\n\r\nI was immediately surprised to connect that soft voice with the mid-twenties gothic woman who walked through the door. Her hair was a cliché black, tied back into some sort of elaborate bun; her skin was porcelain, and her eyes were a fiery blue. Though she was obviously dressed up for the interview I knew nothing about, I could tell by her mix of intricate jewelry and the hints of tattoos peeking out from her polo shirt that she almost certainly preferred black dresses in her off time.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, nails sharp and painted a deep crimson. \"I'm December.\" She smiled, showing strikingly white teeth behind her red lips. \"Last name (redacted). Lovely to meet you.\"\r\n\r\nI stood, taking her hand in mine. We shook, and I motioned toward the chair on the opposite side of the desk. \"Nice to meet you. Have a seat, December.\" I chose to ignore the humor in her all-too-accurate name. Hell, even her hand was as icy as those eyes. \"I didn't have you on my schedule, but I've got a few minutes to talk before my shift ends. I'm at a bit of a disadvantage, so please tell me about yourself.\"\r\n\r\nShe pulled a sheet of paper from the folder she was holding so swiftly it was like a magician performing a trick. \"My application,\" she said, passing it across the desk. \"I didn't have an appointment, but the waitress sent me back to you. She said you were pretty desperate for a new Host.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced down at her resume, finding she ticked off all the necessary boxes in the experience department: customer service, food prep, even a management job at a tattoo parlor. The irony never ends. \"Well, that's alright then. Looks like you've had some experience in the field. But I've had 4 other interviews today, so tell me what makes you right for the job.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, tilted her head slightly. Her eyes felt like they were drilling holes through my head. \"My mother was a Host here years ago. She spoke highly of the job, and remembered it fondly.\"\r\n\r\nI swallowed, my mouth suddenly dry. \"That...is interesting. How long ago was this?\"\r\n\r\nDecember smiled again. \"How long have you worked here, Mr. (redacted)?\"\r\n\r\nI tapped my fingers on my desk again, concerned by this sudden turn of events. \"I started working at The (redacted) House when I was 16. So, over twenty years. Why?\"\r\n\r\nThe smile never left her lips, but it seemed to me as if the blue of her eyes darkened a few shades. \"She would have started around the same time as you did, in that case.\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell softly in the room, like a surprise snowfall. It seemed to stretch and spin out for minutes, though I'm sure it was merely seconds.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed like a slow, cold eternity, I cleared my throat and said, \"You're hired.\"\r\n\r\nDecember nodded.\r\n\r\n\"When can you start?\" I adjusted the collar of my shirt, somehow sweaty and sticking to my neck.\r\n\r\nShe gestured lightly with both hands, red nails flashing in the glow of the overhead lights. \"How about now? I'm free most evenings.\"\r\n\r\nIt was my turn to nod. \"Great. Let me show you to the locker room. It's small but clean. I think we have a few spare uniforms in there, too.\"\r\n\r\nHer blue eyes seemed to almost glow. I felt sweaty and displaced, as if the dynamic of this interview had been completely flipped on its head. \"Perfect.\"\r\n\r\nDecember followed me down the short hallway silently, oddly close on my heels. I fumbled with my large keyring at the steel door at the end of the hall. \"You'll have to turn on the light with the pull chain in the middle of the room,\" I said, the words coming out automatically.\r\n\r\nI didn't like her being so close.\r\n\r\nAt last I found the right key. Sliding it into the lock, I was fully aware of how close she was to me. I could smell a delicate perfume mixed with something else...something darker, more visceral. I shook my head and clear it. \"Here we are.\"\r\n\r\nI opened the door and stepped back quickly, allowing her room to pass.  \"Thank you,\" she said, the words seemingly whispered directly into my ear from those red lips.\r\n\r\nI shuddered. December walked into the dark room. It took her only a few moments to find the chain for the light.\r\n\r\nAs she pulled it, I turned away, not wanting to see the horrific thing dwelling in the room. I slammed the door shut and locked it.\r\n\r\nDecember's screams lasted longer than I expected.\r\n\r\nI checked my watch. Twenty minutes had passed, and the room was quiet. Finally.\r\n\r\nHand shaking, I unlocked the door and pushed it open. December stepped out, head bowed.\r\n\r\n\"Are...Are you ready?\" I stammered.\r\n\r\nHer head snapped up, her blue eyes now a glowing, angry violet. \"I am. The (redacted) House has found its new Host.\"",

        "text": "\nAbout a decade back i used to work at a brewery/pub. It was set in a pretty big and old building, from the early 1900’s. \n\nI worked there for a couple of years, and most of the time the it was pretty chill, but backbreaking at times. On my time working there i had two experiences that i can only describe as supernatural.\n\nThe first one, it was a particular late night and i was task with closing up the hangar/loading docks. Closing it up was making sure there wasn’t anything obstructing where the trucks would park, stacking up any loose crates, turning the lights off and locking it all up. \n\nI was about done, so i turn of the lights and as i’m making my way to the door a beer bottle comes rolling towards me from the dark between the tall stacks of crates. It wasn’t forceful or anything, it looked like someone gently placed it on the floor and rolled it towards me. \n\nI didn’t thought too much of it, so i picked up the bottle and placed it inside a half empty crate. I turned around and as i started walking another bottle comes rolling from the same place, than another one. Tired and thinking it was a coworker trying to fuck with me i shout “Hey, alright, you got me. Come on i gotta close it up” I expected to hear laughter or something, but instead i was dead silent. \n\nI waited for a couple minutes, turned on my flashlight and started looking around the stacks of crates for what I thought it would be a giggling coworker. After searching each corner and turn i gave up. I was a little weirded out at this point, but i just picked up the two bottles from the ground and placed in the same crate as the first one.\n\nI turned off my flashlight and shouted at the darkness “Alright, I’m locking up. See you tomorrow” just as a finished saying that a crate full of bottles fell from one on the stacks and landed two feet from me, glass shards and beer exploding everywhere.\n\nThe next day i told my boss about it and he said it was probably a rat. The thing is, those crates when full probably weights 20 pounds, how could a rat push it? \nTalking to my coworkers they told me that they’ve also experienced weird stuff during closing hours.\n\nMy second experience happened again when i was closing the place. This time i was closing the pub.\n\nWhen closing the pub the last thing you usually do is restock the walk-in freezer. The freezer is probably just as old as the building itself and it sits underground, right beneath the bar. \n\nI was down there filling that enormous thing with kegs and crates. Being a very old freezer from a time when safety wasn’t a big concern the thing doesn’t open from the inside, no handle, nothing. Just a flat, plain steel door.\n\nSo i did what I always did when i had to go inside that thing, i put a keg securing the door open. I was halfway through the task when i hear the door slamming shut, i rush towards the door but it’s locked shut. I started pounding on it, but the only other person there was my boss in the office, two floors above me, probably with his door closed. I tried my phone, but since I’m locked underground inside a steel and led box i had no service.\n\nI was wearing only jeans ans a T-shirt so things were getting chilly pretty quickly, my face was going numb and my hands were getting stiff, i made a blanket out of cardboard but it was doing very little keeping the cold at bay. \n\nThe only reason I didn’t freeze to death was because i had a date with a regular and she went there looking for me. She asked my boss where i was and when he couldn’t find me he went to the basement and found me inside the freezer. I was there for about 45 minuted when he found me and i was starting to consider writing a letter to my parents and drinking myself to sleep.\n\nMy boss installed a chain to keep the door open after that, but i refused to ever walk in to that death trap again. Weirdest part, the keg i had holding the door open was at the other side of the room when i got out. It was a full steel keg, not something that just slides away, let alone quietly.\n\nI stop workin there shortly after for unrelated reason.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Let’s start off with when this began. \n\nI go to a small private school where everyone knows everyone. One day I heard this bell ring. It’s not like the one that the teacher uses to let us know that the class period has ended. For the purposes of this I’ll call the teacher Mrs.D. For some reason no one else, that I know of, can hear the ring of this bell. When it rings and I look around, no one has a reaction to it. I know that it’s not a ringtone or a text tone. The bell never rings at the same time either, it can ring during lunch or class. I’ve asked Mrs.D if she has heard it but she just looks at me like I have three heads or something. I’ve asked my friends but they just say that I’m hearing things or it’s part of the music I listen to, I know it’s not. \n\nOne day I decided to investigate the ringing bell. When the Mrs.D asked me to go gets some books from the other building, I stayed and went to explore. First the floor we were on. I looked in every room, even the boys restroom. Then I explored the floor below us, the offices. No luck there. Next was the basement, to clarify our school basement isn’t like the ones in horror stories, this one is where we have our break and lunch. But it did feel a little scaring being alone down there. \n\nI paused my music and started searching. I had a feeling someone, or something, was down there watching me. I’ve never had the feeling down in that basement of this small, Christian, private school. When I sat down for a break I heard a thud from the stairwell area. When I got to the vending machines I looked down and saw a coke, in that little slot they fall to, and a quarter in the coin return. “Weird” I whispered to myself. Someone must have left it from yesterday, it’s before break. \n\nThinking back I know no one would have left a soda in the vending machine. \n\nThe soda got my mind off the thud. I grabbed the coke and pocketed the coin. As I sat down I opened the can and took a sip. “If someone left this then they wouldn’t care if I took it” I said to myself to justify taking the coke. \n\nI turned to look around while I sat  and for a split second I thought I saw a weird figure in the corner of the basement. When I looked at where the figure was all I saw was brick. \n\nThen I heard it. It was louder than usual. It was longer and more ominous. The ring made me spill the coke all over the table, I knew it would stain the white surface. I looked all around me and didn’t see anything but the coke stained table. \n\nI got up and walked over to the teachers’ table and grabbed the roll of paper towels. I cleaned up the spilled soda and threw away the soaked towels. Once I got everything situated, I sat down and drank the little bit of coke that the can had left for me. \n\nAs I started to get worried that I was just hearing things I stood up to start getting to the task that was assigned to me. \n\nAs I got closer to the door, it slammed shut. “Maybe the wedge gave out?” I tried to think positively. When I leaned into the door it wouldn’t budge. I tried again, and again… Still it wouldn’t budge. \n\n“Alright! Quit messin’ and let me out!” I half yelled to the door hoping one of my friends were leaning onto it keeping me from leaving this basement. \n\nAfter those words had left my lips, I heard that damned bell again. Somehow it was longer and scarier. More ominous. \n\nThen something happens that turned me paler than I already was…\n\nAll the voice said was:\n“You…. Are…. Not…. Leaving…. This…. Place….”",

        "text": "I'm writing this as a last resort for any help or advice. Something has been happening to my health and I can't explain why. \n\nI'm a college athlete. I used to play tennis for my representative college team. I haven't been able to join practise for about 2 months now. \n\nI started by getting extremely nauseous after and during practise. My coach would tell me to take it easy or made me leave early. I tried paying attention to my diet. My bloodsugar. I'm not on any medications. It kept getting worse every day until I had to take a break. On the last day i threw up something brown. \n\nI was resting at home. Trying to recover. My coach made me go to the hospital to get my blood tested. Nothing came back as odd. On the same day I get a nosebleed. I call the clinic and they just tell me to apply pressure. I do it for an hour and the bleeding just contenues. I call back again and they tell me they're too overcrowded to help me \"over a nosebleed\". So I stay home. \n\nI live alone. My parents and I don't talk much. I never like to bother them with my stuff. I mostly keep to myself. A week goes past and I start getting nosebleeds every other day. I call the clinic and it goes straight to a call waiting line. Nobody picks up. My coach says if I can't make it to practise soon I might lose my spot to another student that recently moved here. \n\nI decide to go to practise the next day. I was supposed to play a match against the new student. I'm very nervous. I'm waiting for them to start. My nose starts bleeding again. I excuse myself to the bathroom to go stuff a tissue in there. \nI'm looking in the mirror and suddenly feel my pulse getting stronger. I feel lightheaded. I start to lean against the bathroom wall and I fall. My ears start ringing. At this point I'm scared. Everything is going black. I feel cold. My body is starting to shiver. \n\nNext thing I know I see a janitor next to me asking what's wrong. I guess I must've blacked out. He says I was just sitting there. I feel really confused and embarassed. I ask whats going on and he says everyone left. The place is closing. Apparentlt the coach thought I left home. I slowly get up and say sorry. \n\n\"Man what the hell? Did I pass out? Why did no one check up on me?\" Im thinking to myself. I have no idea what to do so I decide to go to the ER. At the ER I get to see a doctor after an hour of waiting. She seems very annoyed at me and only asks me some basic questions. I try to tell her what happened and she just repeats the same questions and shrugs her head at the nurse. \n\n\"So you're convinced you \"randomly\" passed out? And what do you want me to do about it now? Your vitals are normal\"\n\nIm shocked. I've never been talked to in such a condescending manner. I say yes and I request maybe some sort of medication. She tells me I can buy glucose tablets incase I feel nauseous again. Wtf? Glucose tablets. I have no other option than to go home. The nurse is starting to get agitated too. \n\nI make a short trip to the pharmacy and then go home. I sit down for a moment and start wondering what's up. I'm feeling frustrated at this point. My exams are coming up and I don't feel well at all. It's already late. So I try to sleep it off. \n\nNext day I'm on a lecture taking some notes and my arm goes numb for a few seconds. It feels like pins and needles. I shake it off and try to move it around. I feel tired even though its already 10 am. I take a closer look at my arm and it's starting to look red. It goes numb again. I shake it again. My classmate next to me says \"dude what the fuck, stop you're shaking the table around\" I say sorry. Lecture ends. I go home again. \n\nI'm opening the door. My keys keep falling out of my hand. Something is really wrong. I finally make it inside and lay down. My fingers feel stiff as I try to dial the ER line. They put me on hold. After an hour they pick up. My arm feels much better now. I ask for advice. The nurse literally hangs up on me. I call again. The nurse picks up and when I say hello they instantly tell me \"we've gotten some information about you recently. We have reasonable suspicion that you've been making trips here and faking an illness. If you call again and contenue this we can file a report. Please don't call the ER unless you have an actual emergency okay?\"\n\nIm speechless. I try to argue saying that's not true. They hang up again. What the fuck do I do now? I get up and take a couple glucose tablets. I try to look up my symptoms but nothing shows up right. I'm feeling anxious. My heart rate is going up. I feel so mad. My nose is starting to bleed. I stuff another tissue in there and try to calm down. After two hours I drift to sleep. \n\nToday I woke up at 5 am. I woke up because my heart rate was off. I crawl out of bed. I notice my legs are stiffer than usual. I try to stretch. It doesn't help. I look back at my bed and notice the pillowcase is covered in blood. Another nosebleed I guess. I take the covers off. Now I feel truly ill. The blood is almost black. I feel weak just looking at it. My legs give up. My arm goes numb. In a matter of a few seconds I'm laying on the floor. I have my phone on the nightstand. I'm freaking out. I reach for my phone. I call my dad. He doesn't pick up. My mom does. I tell her whats going on and she goes silent...\n\n\"Are you serious? You know the clinic called me yesterday and asked a few things about you\"\n\n\"Mom please. I don't have time for this. What was it?? Can you try to get me help I'm scared. I can't move. I think I'm having a stroke or something\"\n\n\"Yeah. They said you'd say that.\" \n\n\"What?? Jesus christ mom I know we have our differences but I am on the floor. I need help.\"\n\n\"I'll call you back okay?\"\n\nI wait 15 minutes. Then 30. Then 60. I really need some water at this point and I'm hungry too. Finally I get a phone call. But it's a private number. \n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"We got information about you and we're willing to take you in okay?\"\n\nI'm relieved hearing those words. They proceed to ask me really weird questions like if I'm armed or have any history of other illness. They tell me they will only take me in if I comply with that departments rules and don't bring my phone. They refuse to tell me why. \n\nThey said they will arrive in an hour max. I feel numb but I'm fully awake. Can someone please explain if this is normal? Should I try to sneak my phone in? They seem very suspicious of me and I don't understand why.",

        "text": "I was reading some true stories on this sub and I remembered that i never shared this one. \n\nIt’s not super elaborate or flashy, but it actually happened, i’d love to hear your thoughts about it.\n\nAbout a decade back i used to work at a brewery/pub. It was set in a pretty big and old building, from the early 1900’s. \n\nI worked there for a couple of years, and most of the time the it was pretty chill, but backbreaking at times. On my time working there i had two experiences that i can only describe as supernatural.\n\nThe first one, it was a particular late night and i was task with closing up the hangar/loading docks. Closing it up was making sure there wasn’t anything obstructing where the trucks would park, stacking up any loose crates, turning the lights off and locking it all up. \n\nI was about done, so i turn of the lights and as i’m making my way to the door a beer bottle comes rolling towards me from the dark between the tall stacks of crates. It wasn’t forceful or anything, it looked like someone gently placed it on the floor and rolled it towards me. \n\nI didn’t thought too much of it, so i picked up the bottle and placed it inside a half empty crate. I turned around and as i started walking another bottle comes rolling from the same place, than another one. Tired and thinking it was a coworker trying to fuck with me i shout “Hey, alright, you got me. Come on i gotta close it up” I expected to hear laughter or something, but instead i was dead silent. \n\nI waited for a couple minutes, turned on my flashlight and started looking around the stacks of crates for what I thought it would be a giggling coworker. After searching each corner and turn i gave up. I was a little weirded out at this point, but i just picked up the two bottles from the ground and placed in the same crate as the first one.\n\nI turned off my flashlight and shouted at the darkness “Alright, I’m locking up. See you tomorrow” just as a finished saying that a crate full of bottles fell from one on the stacks and landed two feet from me, glass shards and beer exploding everywhere.\n\nThe next day i told my boss about it and he said it was probably a rat.

        "text": "\nThis past week completely turned my life around, most things for the better but there are some things that leave an unpleasant taste in my mouth.\nI didn't know how much could happen within a week until, well, now. \n\nTo start things off, my name is Phoebe. I'm 16 and pretty much your average teenager. I hang out with my friends, listen to music, go out shopping, watch anime, all that stuff. Maybe not so average, but I enjoy wearing goth clothes, some fancy accessoires. Like I said, I'm nothing too unique that's worth mentioning. Except there's one thing that differentiates me from the people around me. \n\nUnlike the people around me and presumably most of you people who are reading this, I'm not human. I am what you humans call a monster. Yep, you read right. I was gonna make it a big mystery but eh, this isn't a detective novel. I'm a vampire. An undead. Spooky, right? Well, not really. Now, before you meet me with any prejudice: No, we are not mindless blood thirsty killers. No, we don't think of drinking blood every minute we're awake and no, we don't live in graveyards. Most of us are pretty decent beings actually. But like with you humans, there are some white sheep among us. No wait, you guys say black sheep, right? You know what I mean. \n If you have any questions about what it's like being a vampy, don't hesitate to ask! Just please don't be disrespectful, thanks.\n\nI spent most of my \"life\" in an orphanage. My parents died shortly after I was born. And when I say I spent most of my \"life\" in an orphanage you can guess that this is a really long time. I'm not 16 years old of course. If I were, I'd still scream and cry all day and wiggle around uncontrollably. I'm actually 124 though I would be around 16 if I were a human. During my time in the orphanage I was alone most of the time. I was the only vampire in the orphanage, you know. I was forced to sleep during the day and during the night I was under constant observation. To prevent me from getting myself a midnight snack, as they said. Back then I didn't think much of it but now when I look back at it, I think it's kinda rude. Last week however, I was adopted by a human couple. And lemme tell you this is the happiest I've been in like 80 years or something!\nMy \"parents\" Jenny and Aaron are really sweet and caring. They spent lots of time preparing their apartment so that it's easy for me to adapt to human life style. To be completely honest with you, it's really hard. I'm still super tired during the day and it's hard to sleep at night. But overall I really enjoy living like you humans so far. There are some difficulties of course but nothing I can't deal with. \n\nI'd love to tell you my first week in human society was as happy and welcoming as my parents. But it wasn't. The first day went pretty okay-ish, I'd say. My new tutor Ms. Jones supports the idea of integrating vampires into human society and promised me to always have my back which I really appreciate. I even made a friend on my first day which was and still is a huge success for me. I accidently bumped into her and made her fall. At first she was super terrified of me and basically begged me not to hurt her but after she noticed I'm all fangs but no bite as we say, she quickly opened up to me. Her name's Claire and she's been showing me around the school and you know, adopted me as a friend. Her words, not mine. \n\nOn tuesday things already started to get weird. I was in a bad mood from running into the local jackass and having class with a teacher that very obviously despises me just because I'm a vampire. \n\n\"Hold on, I have to put my books into my locker. Gimme a minute.\" I heard Claire say just a few steps behind me. She's in the same good mood she was in yesterday. I haven't told her about my encounter with jackass aka Kyle, it would ruin her good mood. And of course I haven't told her how he threatened me, piercing my eyes with his own, intimidating me with a clenched fist and his breath reeking of garlic. \n\n\"Uh, take your time. I need to put my stuff away too.\" I tried my best to stop my voice from shivering. I didn't want her to worry for now.\n\n\"You still remember your locker number?\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah, don't worry. I've got a decent memory.\" \n\nI kept walking down the thankfully empty hallway, counting the lockers as their numbers went up. Some of them were decorated with different stickers. Others had scratch marks on them. I guess that's typical for human schools? Still lost in thought I reached out to my locker and opened it.\nMy gaze fell into the small empty mirror hanging at the back of my locker. It was already there when I first used it the day before. I don't even know why it's there in the first place. Maybe the student who used this locker before me just forgot to take it back? I had no reason to put it away so I didn't. After a while I felt Claire tapping my shoulder. \"Hey, is this yours? It fell out of your locker.\" She handed me a small note. I definitely haven't written any small notes and I didn't put any in my locker. \"No, that's not mine. Weird.\", I responded. I opened the note and while I did a familiar scent entered my nostrils. I ignored it however, and turned my attention to the words written on the paper. \n\nI'm watching you. \n\nI'm watching you? That's some lame prank. Zero effort. I stuffed it into my pocket. \"It's just some lame prank probably.\"\n\"You sure about that? I wouldn't disregard it that easily. Who knows who wrote this?\" \n\"That idiot who talked shit about me when Ms. Jones introduced me to the class?\", I rolled my eyes. I tried to appear confident, maybe even tricking myself into being more confident. Even if he's the culprit, what's he gonna do? I'm not planning on letting him bully me. \"You mean Kyle? Yeah, that seems plausible. He's got a problem with anyone stealing his spotlight in any way. Like you being a vampire which, by the way, is super cool!\" she said while poking me with her elbow. \"Wait, you really think so?\" \n\"Heck yeah I do! And your ears are cute! I wish I had pointy ears.\"\n\"O-oh, I see…\"\nI was flattered honestly. Nobody had ever met me with positivity about it before. If I had blood I probably would have blushed.\n\nLater that day on my way home I took the opportunity to look around in the city. I haven't seen much of human society in my 124 years in this world so it was very intriguing to watch the people being busy with their everyday jobs. Waiters and waitresses serving their customers, florists watering their flowers, hairdressers sweeping the floor. It felt kinda peaceful in a way. Some people gave me looks while passing by me of course, but I've learned to ignore them. I'm simply me, what's so wrong about that? My inner peace was abruptly interrupted however, when I went by an alley. I suddenly felt a strong grip around my wrist that pulled me into the darkness of the alley and before I could cry out another hand covered my mouth. \n\n\"Don't make any noise or you're gonna be sorry.\", the man told me. His voice sounded so cold and determined. It took me a moment to realize he had a water gun pushed against my lower jaw. Judging from the burning feeling I immediately got on that spot the water gun wasn't filled with normal water. My heart started to race and I began shaking. \n\n\"Got you, you little pest.\" He slowly took his hand off my mouth. \n\n\"Wh…what do you want from me…?\" was all I was able to blurt out. I felt my shaking breath drying my mouth and throat. I couldn't think and I didn't dare to move a single muscle.\n\n\"Show me your teeth.\"\n\n\"Wh-what?\"\n\n\"Show me! Now!\"\n\nIn a moment of complete panic I did as I was told. You may think I should've just clogged him or screamed for help but when you feel like you're in grave danger (pun intended) and your adrenaline kicks in you sometimes lose control of your body. \n\n\"Holy shit. So it's true. Okay, listen here, you little blood sucker!\" He grabbed the collar of my hoodie and held it tightly. I couldn't even say anything back. Not much longer and I'd start hyperventilating. I squinted my eyes in fear and I felt my legs giving out. \n\n\"Don't even THINK of running your fangs into ANYONE.\"\n\n\"I-I w-won't-…\" I felt my eyes starting to water.\n\n\"I've got my eyes on you from now on. Should you try anything fishy, I will come and get you. And I will end you. Don't make stupid mistakes. Have a good day.\"\n\nWith that he let go of me and left the alley, leaving a shaking and crying mess behind. I don't know how long I sat there with waterfalls leaking from my eyes. Even the passerby who noticed me and asked me what had happened quickly left when she noticed I'm not human. I don't understand why people hate me so much. I haven't done anything to anyone. I just want to live a happy life.\nI took a detour through the local park to calm down. I washed my face with the fountain water. To be completely honest, at that moment I couldn't care less about how dirty it was, I just needed to calm down somehow. I tried sitting on a bench and watching the birds build their nests. I stared up into the sky and looked for clouds that were shaped funny but no luck. I picked some flowers and made a flower crown and gave it to a little girl when she asked me what I was doing. I would've spent more time just sitting there but after a while I noticed my sunscreen was starting to wear off, so I went home. I made sure not to pass by any alleys and to stay in areas where people would see if anyone threatened me. When I arrived at home I noticed the car wasn't there. Which meant there was a chance that I'd be alone. I didn't like that at all. I waved to one of our neighbors before entering the house. When I entered the kitchen I was glad to see Aaron sitting at the table. \n\n\"Hey, Aaron. I'm home…\"\n\n\"Oh, where do you come from now?\"\n\n\"Uh…school?\"\n\n\"I thought you were already home.\"\n\n\"Huh? Why's that?\"\n\n\"I thought I heard a stomping noise from upstairs earlier but that must've been my imagination then. Those ears of mine aren't getting any younger, ha.\"\n\nHe took a sip from what I assumed was coffee and continued to look through his newspaper. I hear most humans do exactly that during breakfast, and not during noon. I've only known Aaron for a bit more than a week but to me he's a pretty goofy guy. That's what I like about him though. \n\n\"Say, little Nightwind…\"\n\n\"Calling me nicknames already? And you do know that's literally my last name?\"\n\n\"Well, it suits you. Or should I call you Batty instead?\"\n\n\"God, please no!\"\n\nHe laughed while I crossed my arms.\n\n\"You're not gonna go exploring the city?\"\n\n\"Sunscreen's wearing off.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see! Jenny put it in the bathroom after you left this morning.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Where is she anyway?\"\n\n\"Buying groceries. She should be back in an hour.\"\n\nI left him be and went to the bathroom to put on sunscreen and change contact lenses. My hair also got messy from my encounter in that alley so I fixed it. The only thing I wanted to do for the rest of the day was lie in my bed and sleep. Just relax my legs, listen to music and-\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nWhen I opened the door to my room I looked into the eyes of a woman standing right in the middle of the room. I froze and felt my heart starting to race again. After a second the woman quickly jumped out the window and disappeared. I immediately ran downstairs.\n\n\"Aaron!!! Aaron! Hey!\"\n\n\"Phoebe? What happened? Why are you yelling?\"\n\n\"I…the stomping noise from earlier…!\"\n\n\"Calm down! What about it?\"\n\n\"There was someone in my room!\"\n\nI told him about the situation and he didn't hesitate to inform his colleagues. He's a police officer, you know. However, I didn't tell him about the little pin the woman lost in my room. It was lying right beneath the window. It looks like a family crest but it just shows the sun. But like, in a weird way. Hard to describe. It feels as if the way it's drawn has some kind of meaning to it. I tried to look it up online but I found nothing. It's been keeping me awake at night. This sun symbol somehow gave me a really bad feeling and it still does as I'm writing this.\nThe following two days I saw that woman again in the distance. Could be coincidence, could be her watching me which would be super freaky. If she keeps on doing that I might start to get daymares.\nThe rest of the week nothing further happened that would be worth mentioning. Though that was probably because I begged Claire to accompany me on the way to school and home. If those people, if they're working together that is, were watching me, hoping to catch me alone, well they didn't get the opportunity they aimed for. \n\nI seriously don't know what to think of all this. To be honest, I'm really scared. I know Claire and Aaron are doing what they can to help me but these people don't seem like amateurs. If I'm not careful or unlucky they might get me. For whatever reason.\n\nI'm writing this on saturday but I don't know when I'll manage to post it. I'm thinking of maybe staying at a friend's place who lives pretty far away from here, at least until Aaron finds out what those people's deal is. Thing is, I don't even know if these people are working together, that guy from the alley and the woman at least. Kyle is a whole different problem. Heck, I don't even know what that woman was after. Maybe she was just a skilled thief who chose our house to rob and because she didn't find what she is looking for she suspects I have it on me? It seems unlikely but unlikely doesn't equal impossible, does it? \nThe alley guy has problems with me being here, that's a fact. I told Ms. Jones about all that happened too, even the note in my locker. Unfortunately she can't do that much but she promised to help me whenever I need her. She's too nice to me. I think I should make her a small gift to show her how much I appreciate her. What do you guys think?\n\nIt feels like the whole city knows there's a vampire living here now. If it did, things could become even more dangerous. I know we don't know each other but please, I would appreciate any good advice. If you could tell me anything, even if it's just your ideas on what's going on, that would be great. \n\nI'll try to update you whenever I can, I don't know how often though. Until then. Stay safe, mortals.",

        "text": "I can't believe this. I can't fathom any fucking part of this anymore. It's been a pretty sucky night, I couldn't really sleep and I kept jumping at every little noise I heard, thinking it could be Nick coming to take his due. But it wasn't. Not so far, at least. \n\nSo I guess it's time to talk about my Dad. Thing is, up to this day I never figured there was much to say about him at all. My father is… well. He's hardly worth mentioning. I don't even know how old he is, exactly. We never talk anymore. Hell, we never really have. I had a lot of time to think about that when I was digging up the frozen ground alongside Casimir yesterday. I eventually told him to just stand back and let me do the work. He was panting an awful lot. \n\n\"You okay? Where's all that stamina you always brag about?\" \n\n\"Shut up,\" he muttered, leaning into his shovel for support. \n\nI frowned. \"Cas?\"\n\n\"I'm fine!\" he grunted. \"Let's do this.\"\n\nHe lifted his shovel once again, but I stepped out of the hole and placed my hand on his chest, gently pushing him back. \"Go get inside. Warm up and drink some water. You look like you're about to pass out.\"\n\nGrumbling, he tossed the tool aside and lumbered up the steps to the porch. I continued digging for a while, but ended up having to take a break and sit down. I jumped when out of nowhere, a brown bird landed on my shoulder. It was so fat it was nearly circular, and it looked rather funny, what with its puffy feathers and the teeny-tiny beak. It took to the air again right away, flapping its itty-bitty wings like crazy in a futile effort to keep its heavy body up. It bumbled around for a moment, and I started laughing hysterically—it was simply too amusing. Blinded by tears of laughter, I didn't *see* the transformation, but after I'd wiped my eyes, I found a familiar tree monster towering over me. \n\n\"Holy shit,\" I pressed out in-between fits of giggles. \"You're so great, I fucking love you!\"\n\n*\"Well.\"* Aleksei bowed his head like an actor after a performance. *\"Did you know it was me?\"*\n\n\"Of course I knew it was you. If there's a bird around here, it's always you. What brings you by?\"\n\n*\"I saw you breaking your back there. Fiona, you saved me from an affliction that would have cost me my life; if you need something, just—\"* He plunged one set of claws into the ground where I'd been digging and pulled out a sizable chunk of earth. *\"—ask.\"*\n\n\"Oh. Thank you. You just made that easier. And I *was* planning on asking you for help sometime, but I was gonna save that favor for something tricky.\"\n\n*\"My benevolence isn't quite so fickle as that,\"* Aleksei replied, sounding almost reproachful. *\"I'm not a common fairy.\"*\n\n\"So you're saying there will be no petty favor-trading?\"\n\n*\"No. If you ever find yourself in need of my assistance, you will have it. That I swear.\"*\n\nI found myself moved by his words. For a moment, I didn't know what to say. Then, I settled on teasing. \"So… I can finally make you a friendship bracelet?\"\n\n*\"Impertinent wench,\"* he grunted.\n\n\"Ruin the moment, did I?\"\n\n*\"Utterly. That out of the way, why is it that you seem so mournful? You look plain when you cry.\"*\n\nI sighed. \"You couldn't just keep on being nice, could you? It's about Tom Hayes. And my Dad. Turns out he probably instigated this whole mess. Cas and I, we've been… we've been trying to figure out how to go about this. You don't happen to know anything about my father, do you?\"\n\nThe Leshy hummed in thought, casually wrapping his talons around the coffin sitting behind me on the porch and lifting it up as if it were a football. He unceremoniously nudged it into the hole before sweeping his paw over the heap of soil we'd piled up on the side, covering up the grave for good. *\"I never spoke with him. A very religious man, is he not?\"*\n\n\"Yes, definitely. And that's honestly one of the only things I ever really knew about him.\" I shrugged. \"We weren't close.\"\n\n*\"How glad I am for that! He would have steered you in a wholly different direction with all his devout ramblings. Back when your mother used to come to talk to me, she was worried his beliefs would clash with your bloodline's responsibilities. She had the right of it! She never spoke with me again after their wedding.\"*\n\n\"Oh. I had no idea you two were friends.\"\n\n*\"That is not the word I would have used. Anna Novak was… a fair warden to me. For that first half of her life. But that is all that ever was to it. She'd occasionally come to ask for advice, and I would provide it happily enough, but there was no bond to speak of save for this courtesy. After she was wedded, she distanced herself from the woods entirely. It was still sad to receive news of her death, though.\"* He glanced at the ground by our feet. *\"And now I've buried her son. It would seem that many members of your clan find their final resting place here beneath the red meadow.\"*\n\n\"Many?\" I repeated. \"Who else is there? Aside from Mom.\"\n\nAleksei's snout crinkled. What a very human expression on the face of a stag. *\"How much were you told? Do you know of Arkadiusz?\"*\n\n\"Arkadiusz…?\"\n\n*\"I see that further explanation is necessary. Considering your shift in responsibilities, is this something you wish to pursue?\"*\n\n\"I don't know. Can I… get back to you on that? Maybe? I'm definitely intrigued, but I couldn't say how much information I can handle right now.\"\n\n*\"Understandable. I will find you when you're ready.\"* He straightened up, his muscles groaning like bending wood. *\"I haven't yet had the opportunity to say so, but… having a soul suits you. You look fetching when there's life in your eyes. And if this constitutes an improvement to your quality of life, then I'm very glad for you.\"*\n\n\"Uh… thank you. It's nice to hear that.\"\n\n*\"Heire—Fiona, if I ever mistreated you, please—\"*\n\n\"We're good. And it's good to know you, it's good that you're in charge around here. Wouldn't want any other creature to be.\" \n\nHe looked at me for a while, his gaze completely unreadable. Whatever was going on behind those animal eyes, he wasn't intent on sharing. Huffing out a warm cloud of breath into the chilly winter air, he nodded, turned and trotted off towards the treeline. I patted down the dirt over the grave, flattening the ground with my shovel, before returning inside to check on Casimir. He was resting on the couch, looking much better than a couple minutes ago.\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"I'm alright. So, where… where do we go from here? Why would Dad do something like this, I don't… I don't get it. I mean, yes, he hates you, and he's always hated the woods, but I never thought he'd go and do something like this.\"\n\n\"No clue. Could you maybe reach out to him? Call him and put it on speaker? He doesn't have to know you're here,\" I suggested. \n\nCas nodded, readily pulling out his phone. He dialed the number and for a couple minutes, we listened to the ringtone with bated breaths. No one picked up, though. \n\nAfter my little brother ended the call, I cleared my throat. \"While we're both feeling extremely uncomfortable, would you care to talk about what happened with Jem?\"\n\n\"Do we have to? Right now, I mean?\"\n\n\"I guess not. I just think we oughta discuss it at some point. It's no good to keep that kinda thing bottled up.\"\n\nHe kept on dodging the question and I have up eventually. We ended up turning in pretty early, hoping to rest up. I figured maybe some extra hours of sleep would soothe my mind. Why I thought that I could finally catch a break, I'll never know. \n\nI woke up to the sound of nails reading across a hard surface, a grating, nasty sound that had me sit up with a start. My heart pounding wildly, I glanced around frantically in an effort to make out the source of the noise, but my room was enveloped in complete and utter darkness. I swallowed, my throat bone dry. \n\n\"Who's there?\" I pressed out, somehow managing to sound at least kind of intimidating. I slowly reached for the drawer in my nightstand; I keep a cross and some salt and stuff in there just in case. Also a knife, because you never know. Before my hand could reach the wooden knob, though, something *kicked* the underside of my bed from below. The entire frame jumped and I fell back onto my heap of pillows with a startled yelp. Flying into a panic, I tore open the drawer, my fingers closing around the handle of the combat knife in an iron grip. Hastily flicking on my bedside lamp, I pressed my back to the wall behind me, my eyes once more darting around the room. Everything was still again. I couldn't see anything out of the ordinary.\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nIt was under the bed, it was *under the fucking bed.*\n\nSummoning all my courage, I leaned over the side of the bed to peek into the pitch-black space underneath it. My breath caught in my throat when I found gleaming eyes staring back at me. Before I could react, a large hand reached out from below, red fingers with blackened talons gripping and entangling themselves in my long hair, grabbing but not pulling. For a moment, I was frozen in place as the eyes that held my gaze moved closer, revealing the face they were set in.\n\n\"Boo.\"\n\nAll my pent-up fear escaped me in one long, deep sigh. \"I should have fucking known.\"\n\nNick rolled out from under my bed and sat up in one fluent motion, smirking widely. \"Oh, I'm sorry, did I scare you?\"\n\n\"Yes, you did. Though I'm surprised you've got nothing better to do, considering who you are.\"\n\nHe smiled thinly. \"I've always time to prove a point.\"\n\n\"Point being?\" I asked in sharp exasperation.\n\n\"You really ought to be more respectful. Have I given you the impression that you have nothing to fear from me?\"\n\n\"Look, it's not that I'm not afraid of you. Honestly, Nick, you terrify me. You are a being whose true form exceeds comprehension, you command hell itself… You're a goddamn nightmare. And not the kind I like.\" I rolled my shoulders, wincing at the crack they produced. \"But I'm just so, *so* exhausted.\"\n\nNick's features softened. He looked upon me with kind eyes, an expression that would have likely put me at ease coming from literally anybody else. \"Aww,\" he cooed, tilting his head. \"I'm sorry to hear that. You do look awfully tired.\" He extended his hand as if he wanted to touch my face, but I batted it away as soon as it got close. He didn't comment on it, dropping his arm with his deceptively tender gaze still trained on me. \"Let me mend it then,\" he said. \"I might present you with some options you'd like to consider.\"\n\n\"Could you please just tell me what you want from me? I've no nerve for any more bullshit right now.\"\n\nHis lips twitched, almost giving in to a display of fury but not quite. \"Fair enough.\"\n\n\"Cool. Let's go downstairs and talk this out in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Let's not. Let's stay here.\"\n\n\"This is kind of my personal space,\" I argued.\n\n\"Oh, I know.\"\n\nI groaned. \"Alright. Bring it.\"\n\nNick grinned, rising to his feet and sitting down at the foot of my bed. \"This property of yours is special. I'll admit that I'm not all-powerful, and your land, well… I have little to no influence here. Back when the black mill was still inhabited and being used, I had the Hettmanns tell me what was going on here from time to time, but with Jacek having taken his place at my side, even the last one of my worshippers has left this place. This puts you into an interesting position. Your land is neither mine nor…\" He paused, rolling his lips together.\n\n\"God's?\" I suggested.\n\nHe nodded, brows furrowing.\n\n\"You've trouble saying that, eh?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I'm out of my comfort zone here. No matter. The creatures here are unholy, but not under my rule, the ground is impure but not tainted… it's difficult. There's no higher or lower power pulling the strings here. This place is… unclaimed territory. Which is why I believe that a certain being chose it as its resting place.\"\n\n\"A certain being?\" I echoed. \"What kind of being?\"\n\n\"A powerful one. If you think that *I* exceed comprehension, then you couldn't even begin to understand the one I'm looking for. It's a creature that wasn't made by the divine hand. I do not know how it came into being, if it was ever birthed… perhaps it simply *is*. I could not describe it to you in any words that you would fathom. But I have been searching for it for a long, long time.\"\n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"I need to consume it. I need it within me. I need to be one with it. This thing, this creature… it could help me turn the tide.\"\n\n\"Turn the tide?\" I repeated. \"Do you mean—\"\n\n\"Exactly what you think I mean.\" Nick's smile grew, now looking like it could split his face. \"And since you hold some semblance of authority here, I want *you* to locate it for me.\" He drew closer. \"You're shaking, Fiona. This do anything to wake you up?\"\n\n\"I don't want to help you,\" I gritted out. \"I don't wanna do this.\"\n\n\"Why? Cuz you're so devout all of a sudden? *Please.*\" He let out a derisive snort. \"You haven't been to church since your father dragged you there nearly two decades ago. You are *vain, lustful, lazy…* Do I really need to go on? All this sounds to me like you've very much picked a side. You prefer chaos over order. You're not a pure little dove, Miss Novak, and no amount of pristine white gowns is gonna change that. Besides…\" He trailed off, and I squeaked when his eyes turned an inky black, his skin paled and his hair curled atop his head. \"I do have something you want.\"\n\n\"Stop that,\" I hissed. Dread mixed with nausea as I saw him take on Jacek's features. \"Change back!\"\n\n\"Calm down, it's all good! Hey, I promised I'd give him back. I've thought about it, and seriously, I wouldn't mind you two hooking up again. Do you have any idea how powerful that boy is? How powerful *you* could be? If you two had a kid, it'd be splendid.\"\n\nI let out an incredulous laugh. \"And you'd eat that too, would ya?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Nothing personal. It's all about the might.\"\n\nI shuddered, face scrunching up. \"I think this isn't a conversation I wanna be having.\" \n\n\"Well, then I guess that's just a discussion for another day.\" He stood up, wiping the corner of his mouth. \"My request is clear, though? Find me this sleeping being and tell me where it rests. I'll be in touch, so don't stress out over contacting me. I expect results *soon*, but not quite so soon that you'll lose more sleep over it.\" The Devil grinned, reaching out to tip my chin up. \"Rest assured, I never ask for more than people can give. I take care of mine.\"\n\n\"I'm not yours!\" I shouted.\n\nBut he had already disappeared into thin air.\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1085qzf/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_heres_why/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1095w2g/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_freak_deer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10a5ij3/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10b1dy9/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cac2n/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10dbk6i/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_devil/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ebyr1/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_sauna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fa2ec/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h64is/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_aleksei/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 18](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10i0d0p/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_when_shit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10jbwml/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 20](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10k7oob/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

He told me \" have you checked the news on what is happening?\" No i said...i was sleeping in my bed....\"dude you gotta check the news man....this is exactly like a zombie apocalypse but....its different kind of people\"...\"what the heck are you even saying are you drunk?\" I asked him....\"no you idiot just check the news if you think I'm drunk....and in the meantime I'm driving over to your house right now!\"\n\nHe sounded like he wasnt jokin around which he usually did....so i turned on the tv...to my horror...he wasnt....the whole city was in panic.... apparently there were......lets say creatures if not people running around in the city murdering people with a knife....but...the terrifying thing is...they had no face....no eyes...no mouth...just a knife in their hands and murdering people in the open...\n\nThe police reports said....they were immune to gunshots...these creatures were all over the city....the police didnt knew the exact count of how many were there.....i thought to myself \"that person who knocked must be one of em\"...then suddenly i heard my neighbour scream at the top of her lungs....with the sound of someone being stabbed continuously....thankfully i had a katana knife with me as i was a samurai trainee and pretty good with swords...\n\nI grabbed my sword....went to the door....i looked outside through the peephole....blood all over the walls....on the floor...then all the lights went out.....two shadow figures walked across my door as i saw through the peephole...they were walking abnormally......i was scared...i grabbed a flashlight and got the courage to open the door....i slowly opened the door..thankfully the door didnt make any creaking noise because of good maintenance...\n\nAs i opened the door....i saw those two figures walking away far down the hallway....looking at every door...it looked like they were searching for humans....i looked at my neighbours house and saw something that shocked me to my core...i saw my neighbour laying on the ground...dead..stabbed multiple times..her intestines were out of her body..her stomach was cut open...chunks of her flesh on the floor...\n\nI almost screamed but i controlled myself...then i slowly walked to the stairway which was not far for my room.....i almost reached the stairs when i looked at them again and saw the two figures charging towards me with full speed....i started running and trying not to cry and scream for help....i knew screaming for help wasnt gonna do any good because most of the people were killed by those creatures...\n\nAs i reached the ground floor..i ran through the sidewalks..while running i saw one of them about 50 feet away from me....i thought i was done....i had no choice but to fight it with my sword....so i stopped....the creature ran towards me like a lunatic....i saw the figure clearly....no eyes....no mouth...it was as if they can sense humans..... they had a human figure.....they had a 7.5 inch knife in their hand...so it charged towards me....i made an attempt to slit its throat....\n\nAnd i did...but...it didnt make any difference......it still was swinging its knife at me like nothing even happened.....then i made an attempt to cut his hand....i missed a couple of times...but i made it happen....it finally fell to the ground when i did that.....but his hand didnt leave the knife even after being cut off from the body..as if te knife was sticked to its hand..after this i continued running looking for a safe place to hide until my friend came to pick me up....\n\nl found a warehouse just down the block....hid behind a couple of boxes....and took my phone out to call my friend...as i was dialing the number....i could hear many peoples scream being murdered by these creatures alongside with the sound of gunshots....but i knew that gunshots didnt make an affect on them....as i called and told him where i was....i heard footsteps beside my hiding spot....it sounded as if they were looking for me....i stayed silent in my spot praying that they would go away but...no...it was as if they knew where i was hiding and waiting for me to come out...\n\nAfter about 5 minutes....the sound of the footsteps disappeared...i then got out of my hiding spot....went to the door and tried to look outside....i saw multiple people lying on the floor....blood everywhere on the road...the walls....cars...everything.....as i was looking...i suddenly felt a sharp pain in my back.....it was them....they hadn't left after all....i tried to fight back....and i did...i knew their spot was their hand....so i aimed to cut their hands while fighting these creatures....\n\nI killed one of them...but the pain was so intense i didn't had the power to fight the second one....so i tried to run and i ran in the middle of the street....after running for like...5 seconds...i fell down on the road..and looked at the creature about to stab me to death and knew my life was gonna end right then and there...\n\nBut...suddenly a car came at full speed and hit the creature....it was shawn.....he got out of the car with a sword....\"aim for the hand with the knife!\".....he did exactly as i told him and killed it immediately....he was also a samurai trainee and we trained together..he also knew how to handle swords....he killed it and came to me as i was lying on the road....\n\n\"You okay?\" He asked....and before i responded.....i saw 6 of the creatures running towards us with full speed from down the road.....i screamed \"get in the goddamn car! They're behind you!!\" He saw them and immediately carried me and put me in the passenger seat and got in the car and started driving....i passed out in the car because of the wound.",

        "text": "Up until yesterday, I would've said my dog was absolutely fearless.\n\nI've  watched all 35lbs of him tell off a full sized Great Dane without  patting an eyelash at the dog park. He defeated the Roomba monster, could care less about thunder, and will actually supervise a room being  vacuumed.\n\nLast night though? He actually whimpered and started shaking.\n\nWe  were taking our usual nightly walk around 8pm, about a mile long going  past my town's elementary school. Next to the school is a patch of  swampy woods. Normally there are street lights evenly spaced along the  road. This whole week though the street lights were winking out one by  one. It's been mighty cold lately, maybe the new LEDs couldn't take the  cold, right?\n\nWell, maybe not.\n\nWe  get to the patch of woods next to the school and my dog just freezes in  place. I walk up next to him and ask him what's wrong. And he's just  staring into the darkness, frozen in place, starting to shiver.\n\nWhen I touch him? He didn't respond.\n\nThen I heard some ice crackle, and my pup noped the heck out of there. Started whimpering and SPRINTING back towards home.\n\nI  might have been born at night, but it wasn't last night. I was feeling  the creepy crawlies now too. So we started beating feet back towards  home.\n\nHe didn't let up the entire  time, and I was having trouble keeping up and keeping my footing, so I  never really got a good look at anything behind us, though lord knows I  looked over my shoulder when I was able. Really only saw something  indistinct in the dark. Larger than the rabid fox I dragged my pup away  from last week, smaller than an adult human.\n\nIt wasn't a child. Not on a night that cold. Surely not.\n\nWe  make it home safe and sound, and my dog doesn't even pause for a treat.  He sprints up the stairs, jumped on the bed in the guest room, and  stared out the window, still shaking.\n\nI looked too, didn't see anything, and just shrugged it off. Was weird, but it is what it is, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThis  morning while I was rolling my garbage cans back up towards my house my  neighbor grabbed my attention, wants me to take a look at something.\n\nThere's  a set of tracks in the snow, leading up to his chicken coop. Very small  sneakers that walked onto his lawn from the road and up to his chicken  coop. Which looked like a horror movie. Blood and feathers everywhere,  no other damage. No signs of any birds.\n\nWhen I say no other damage I mean the chicken wire wasn't damaged and the only way in was a door. Which was closed.\n\nA similar set of sneaker tracks lead back from the coop to the road.\n\nI  started getting a creepy crawly feeling, goosebumps and all. I tell my  neighbor about my experience last night walking the dog. He starts  shifting uncomfortably too.\n\nThe dog was his normal happy courageous self today, seemed like nothing had happened last night.\n\nUntil just now, when I grabbed his harness for walkies. Called him, no response.\n\nHe's back at the window in the guest room, staring and shivering.\n\nOnly this time there's something I can see under the street light out front of my house.\n\nA  child. Standing there in the cold staring at my house, not moving or  shivering despite the cold. Dark brown clotted blood running down his  chin and onto his chest, and a bloated stomach.\n\nAs  soon as I made eye contact with the child? The street light went pop!  and there was darkness. I am scared shitless and just locked all the  windows and doors in my house, but if someone wants in? They're gonna  get in.\n\nWhat the fuck is it? Do I call the cops?",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my early 20s and did not have my life together at all. My mom told me to get a job or get out, and considering I had no money, you know the option I picked. Everything was great, and although I definitely felt out of place since I am VERY introverted, I still sort of enjoyed working, and having my own money was great. \n\nThis all changed when a new employee got hired. He seemed really nice at first, but I slowly started to learn more about him, and to be honest, he was SUPER weird. Like I don’t judge but he was super creepy, and I decided to call him out on it. When it came to female customers, he was always awful. Me and all of my co-workers hate him.\n\nMy boss started to get really agitated with him and had talked to him about how if his behavior did not get any better, he would have to fire him. The only problem is that we had no one to cover for him, and finding someone reliable to work for you when you run a gas station that sells alcohol is hard. You can’t hire anyone under 21 which cuts out like 90% of your options.\n\nThe pay at other stores was far higher as well, so pretty much the only reason you would want to work here is because it is close to where you live, or you have a record, so he never got fired. I thought about it and if they could not fire him, they sure as hell could not fire me, so I started to get meaner with him. I was not violent or anything, just rude. I would feel bad, but it was not only the customers he creeped on, but he was also gross with me. I am the only female employee in the building.\n\nNobody liked him, but in short, I was the worst to him. We got a call one day that he had died in a fatal car crash. It is not like we were jumping for joy, but none of us were sad. He was old, rude, and gave everyone hell. Well, I thought it was all over. Oh god was I wrong. The hatred that he had for me only got worse. I never believed in ghosts before this, but it HAS to be him. There are too many signs.\n\nI don’t have anyone who would pull this kind of prank, I mean, I keep finding photos of him in my mother's house. It is terrifying. To be honest I don’t think I would care that much if that was all, but there were other things as well. I keep finding notes addressed to me in his name. He has been threatening me, and it is terrifying. I found a bunch of razors under my blanket, and now my mom is going on vacation alone. I am terrified, I don’t have friends anywhere but online, and I don’t want to be here alone. He is going to kill me.",

        "text": "*as said by one of my colleague*\n\nWhat made a skeptical cop become much less skeptical about the paranormal.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was 25 at the time this happened working as a correctional deputy in a county jail. I had just been out of the academy for maybe 6 or 7 months. The jail I worked in was pretty small, with only a couple of housing units for the different types of inmates. We had one housing unit for the “mental health inmates”, for example.\n\nParts of the jail were built in the early 1950s, but were retrofitted with some modern tech such as cameras and intercoms. The intercoms were in the jail cells so that the inmates, in an emergency, could reach the floor deputy. They were equipped with a two way mic, so the deputy could talk to the inmate. \n\nWorking here, I got to hear many stories about ghosts and unusual occurrences, both from my coworkers and even the inmates. Being the skeptical guy I am, I didn’t really put much thought into the stories. \n\nOn this night, I was working the 200 housing unit. It was a housing unit made up of individual cells housing one or two inmates per cell. This unit was designated for the more “high risk” inmates who were more likely to assault staff. Most of them were mentally ill and/or insane. \n\nAt 9:15PM, per our usual schedule, we turned off all the lights in the housing unit, and did a final count to make sure all inmates were accounted for. It was towards the end of my shift so I was quite tired and ready to go home. \n\nEverything was quiet and all was well. But then I got a notification on our control computer, indicating that an intercom in one of the inmates cells was activated. I “picked up” the call, and asked the inmate what was wrong. \n\nAll I heard was static and a weird metallic sound. I brushed it off as a glitch or error and went back to reading my favorite gun and gear magazine. \n\nA few minutes later, I got another notification from the same cell. I picked up, and again asked what was wrong. And sure enough, I heard the same weird and unsettling noises. This time they were quite loud and eerie. I hung up and decided I’d make a note of the issue for maintenance, annotating it in my shift notes.\n\nAbout 30 minutes before my shift was over, I got another notification from that same cell. Cell 215. Annoyed and ready to lose my shit, I answered the call. This time, I could faintly hear a strange sound, much different than the other two calls. It almost sounded like someone choking and struggling around the room.  I jumped up and told the other housing deputy about what I was hearing. \n\nWe hurried out of the control room and ran over to the cell. I shined my flashlight into the cell while the other deputy stood by me. But, a shocking realization came over me. The cell was empty. The bunk beds were bare. And no one was inside. \n\nMy partner suggested going back to the control room to confirm the source of the intercom call. So we did. But right as we walked in, we got another call from that same exact cell. Cell 215. The cell we just got back from. The housing sheet also confirmed that the cell was empty and no inmate was currently housed in 215. \n\nWe answered the call, for the fourth time now, and heard what sounded like someone struggling around knocking things over. It was quite obvious this wasn’t a glitch, and I honestly thought an inmate was in need. But it was coming from an empty cell that we had just checked. \n\nWe decided to walk the whole housing unit, individually verifying every cell with our flashlights. But, every inmate was asleep. None of them were choking or struggling. \n\nConfused, I once again walked back to the control room and discussed it with the relieving shift who was just coming in. One of the relieving deputies was a sergeant who had been working in the jail for about 20 years up until that point. He smiled and told me that he isn’t surprised. He explained that about 15 years ago, an inmate in that cell, Cell 215, died from choking himself on food. \n\nHe said the inmates name was “Amador” and he was allegedly arrested for killing his college roommate and storing the body in the dorm. He said that every year around the time he died, strange things happen in that cell. \n\nAt the time, I didn’t believe what he was telling me. But throughout the night, and on my drive home, I replayed the events and it started to convert me into believing the stories. There was no logical explanation for what was happening. I looked up information from what the sergeant told me, on my shift the next day",

        "text": "For a little backstory, I and my mom live alone my dad left when I was 4 but life has always been good until we moved to a large town and I started going to a much larger fancier private school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n was at school one day the day was extremely slow like usual but just after lunch in the chemistry room the loudspeaker announced that we were now in stage 2 medium lockdown ( basically locking doors and windows and hiding because someone was outside) so my teacher locked all the doors and windows and we hid I the back of the classroom I and my friend Joey were joking around and Joey dared me to sneak out of the classroom so I did yeah yeah I know I'm a dumbass but I'm 16 and I hate our chemistry teacher and I thought it would be fun to see him squirm a bit that was until I had actually gotten out of the room I was wondering the halls when all the sudden the principal started yelling through the loudspeaker that we are now in a Stage 5 hard lockdown I started making my way back to the classroom when all the sudden the power went out and I heard screams coming from the chemistry room I looked through the window trying to signal Joey to let me back in but he was staring at something at the front of the room I looked through and almost shit myself staring at the class was a very tall pale naked man with long nails or fingers I couldn't tell it had ripped my chemistry teacher in half and was eating his insides\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI almost threw up but instead, an involuntary scream came out and the creature quickly turned its attention towards me and threw my chemistry teacher at me I ducked just in time and started sprinting as fast as I could I needed to call someone but who I thought about the police but what could they do shoot it? I thought about the military but how the hell do you even call the military that's when I heard the creature call out from over my shoulder shit it found me I took off down the hall again hearing its heavy footsteps behind me I screamed before hiding in the office looking for an escape I decided that I could climb through the vent as I was crawling I stopped was right above it I thought about dropping down on it and trying to kill it but decided against it I continued crawling until I reached another vent I hopped down and hid the police had to be here soon I mean it's a code red lockdown that means someones ( or something in this case) was in the building plus someone else had to of called I eventually made my way to the wood shop room and decided to arm myself with all the power tools I could find and made my way down the hall that's when i saw it oh god i started sobbing it was eating Joey but oh my god he was still fucking alive i wanted to throw up run start screaming crying all at once but i finally worked up enough courage to charge it i started stabbing it with a wood carving knives i pulled out a saw and started trying to gouge out its eyes it worked it dropped Joey but it was already too late i sobbed over my friends corpse for a good 5 minutes when i realized that it was gone i quickly ran down the hallway before i found that thing in the bathroom i pulled out a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing it over and over again until it dropped to the ground i kept stabbing it i dropped the knife and left the bathroom before walking to the office trying to unlock the doors when i heard something in the vent i quickly turned towards the vent where i saw its child?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know what it was but it looked similar to it but also different I quickly pulled out a baseball bat and started beating the thing that's when it suddenly sprouted long claws and stabbed me in the leg I screamed in agony before vomiting on the creatures head I kicked away with my free leg but not before he tore into my leg, even more, my leg was pouring blood like a faucet I quickly limped to the nurse's office and closed the door and blocked the vent so nothing could get in quickly wrapped my leg before trying to stay awake I eventually passed out I woke up at 1:30 AM Jesus it was just like 3:25 that's when I realized the cover for the vent had fallen I quickly grabbed my baseball bat and recovered the vent I saw that the power had been turned back on I quickly roamed the halls with my bat ready to swing I turned the corner and was bombarded with men with guns as they tackled me and handcuffed me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni woke up in a room while chained to a bed a man in a navy blue suit walked in with 2 men in full swat like armor suits i don't know what to call it they both were holding large rifles with pistols at their hips as the man started questioning what i had seen and what i know i told him that all i had known was that the tall gray man had attacked my school i killed it and its baby attacked me the man then told me that my school that i had gone to for 2 years had all been fake my best friend Joey my crush Elizabeth my chemistry teacher Mr. White had all been fake they also informed me that my mom was being questioned as well i asked what the fuck had been going on when the man responded that they were with the **\\[REDACTED\\]** a government agency dedicated to capturing these strange creatures and that all my friends and teachers were all bait food for this weird creature i was the onlyone who had ever survived the pale man is what they called it that's when all the sudden a loud boom could be heard from the other side of the building the two guards quickly baorded up the door and locked us inside one of the guards walkie talkies went off\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"security breach\"",

We lived in a joint family then, my mom and dad slept in the same bed with me I am always in the middle they are overprotective of me. Just when I finally drifted into sleep I saw light I creeped out and jumped out of bed only to realise there was no bed, no room nothing just darkness everywhere.\n\n\nIt took me lots of crying, whining and throwing tantrums to realise there was no one coming to save me I legit thought that I was kidnapped by a devil or dinosaur. I started running I tripped fell and stumbled upon a big black gate it was so black it almost merged with the darkness everywhere.\n\n\nI opened the door there *klatch* *kluk* a spotlight was upon me it gave me some relief thought the feds arrived or something but that hope was crushed when no one came. I took a few steps and then with a shuddering sound the path lit up but strangely the light didn't reflect on the surroundings it just glowed like someone took pity and showed me the way. I started walking some time passed but it didn't look like it was going to end, the surroundings changed without me realising I was now in a maze there were walls that wasn't visible just pitch dark.\n\n\n I started tracing through the area *click* *clack* *click* *clack* the footsteps were getting closer I thought maybe I am saved but it was a kid his head to shoulders were black almost like someone censored it. \n\"Hi are you new here?\"he said with joy in his voice.\n\"Yes did you get kidnapped too.\" I said whimpering\n\"Well sort or maybe not its like we spawned here dont worry you will wake up if you fulfill your daily objective\".\n he said while wearing glasses and a notebook in hand almost like he was an NPC but still humane enough not like the ones in my dads games.\n\n\n\"Let's party up till you get the rules.

There was a rat in it. \n\nI don't like rats as I said. \n\nThe rat told me he cursed my dad and made his eyes black. Suddenly my reflection in the mirror smiled at me! \n But I didn't smlking. (Smiling) \n\nThe rat told me to defeat him I had to fight the ghost of my dad's reflection.

        "text": "They shook my hand when they moved in, which I really liked. Especially when he did it. He has a strong sense of self, I could feel it from the way he gripped my hand, palm against palm. He’s very beautiful. His wife is fine. He’s very beautiful, although I think I’ve told you that before, in which case you must pardon me. He likes to wake up early, before his wife. They have the curtains drawn in their bedroom in the morning, but I can tell that the lights are switched on at 5 am. He goes to the bathroom first, where he is hidden by the frosted glass and heavy fog of the shower. Then to the kitchen, where they have no barrier between themselves and I. I become less a voyeur and more a casual observer, a student of human behaviour, when I don’t have to guess what’s happening behind the thin piece of white cloth. He is very beautiful. He wakes up his kids along with his wife. I don’t particularly care for kids. They are a necessity to create more adults, I understand that, I internalize that, but their questions are long and rambling and I get lost in their little minds. Their thoughts and ideas are not yet fully formed for consumption by others yet. His little daughter, who is five, although her birthday is in March, once asked me why I wasn’t married and I decided right then, that when she brings home her first boyfriend, I’m going to seduce him. I’ll make him fall in love with me, take his virginity and break his heart so badly that he’ll never love again. I’ll shatter him. Maybe then she won’t get married either.\n\nHe’s very beautiful, though. You have to be quiet. I’m talking to you quietly and you have to follow what I do. I’m sorry about all this. I don’t want him to think that I’m crazy, which is why I’ve decided not to fuck his daughters first boyfriend, even though I was pretty set on it for a little while. I had it all planned, I even had the outfit picked out.\n\nI just like to watch him. I watch the others when he isn’t home, just as a casual observer, but he’s my favourite. He’s like a clockwork, so I plan my day according to his. I sleep when he’s at work, and then sit by the window to catch him coming home. He goes to bed at 10:40 pm. Sometimes he fucks his wife before going to sleep. They usually draw the curtains, but not always. He looks very gentle. Don’t tell anyone, although I think he would like to know that I watch him. I think he likes to be watched. He’s a perverted fucking freak in that way, it’s truly disgusting, it makes me gag, it makes me want to just die. But that passes and again it’s just him, his wife and I. I’m telling you this in confidence. His wife can’t find out how he likes that I watch them. She wouldn’t find it prudent. That’s the kind of girl she is, but I know he wants someone sicker than that. Someone who wants to watch and be watched by him.\n\nThey have three children, all of them ugly, but I could learn to love them. Anyone can potentially be loved. I would dye their little blond heads the same beautiful chestnut colour their father has. The oldest is already starting to darken on his own, which suits him very well. He’s the one that looks the most like his father, and so he’s the one I like the best. He’s going to be beautiful one day.\n\nHis wife doesn’t like me. She thinks I’m too jittery and nervous, but what she doesn’t see is that I’m not nervous around her. I’m angry. She’s a whore. She should repent. She’s a disgusting freak of nature. I want her to come to church with me, so I can pin her against the altar and nail her hands against the wood, cut another man’s name into her flesh and let her bleed out, right there. Her warm blood on a cold stone floor. I’m sorry. It all got away from me for a while there. She’s fine.\n\nI’m going to kill her.\n\nI’m sorry, please don’t tell anyone.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, due to my personal reasons I will not be giving away any names so please spare with it and try to understand the incidents which have happened. If any doubt feel free to comment and I will try my best to explain it to you.\n\nLet's Begin.... \n\nI don't know how to explain it but let's start with a little background about when I started feeling something was wrong with my grandma's house, it is my mother's family's property which they still own. I spent most of my childhood in that house as my mother is a working women. Let me make this clear even though I know the house is haunted I have only experienced it once but my two other cousins have actually seen what is lurking in the house. So the back story of the haunted story is what my mother's grandma got to know from some one who owned the property before my grand father. When the initial construction of the house was going on I can roughly assume it to be initial 1900's and so naturally the safety at the construction sites was not up to the mark. As a result one day while there was some work going on and suddenly the whole wall fell on a worker and he died of impact. We do not know exactly if he was buried right there or just that he died there, but it has happened and the story is backed by many siting throughout the years.\n\nLet me give a you a rough map of the house for your understanding, it was a pretty big house with around 3 rooms, a large living room, a kitchen in the front of the house, then there is a lawn which is separating the back of the house with the main house and the lawn has two bathrooms. At the back of the house there were around 3 more rooms and adjacent to the last room there were two more toilets. Just remember this roughly because the incidents all revolve around the back of the house.\n\nLet me start with one of my oldest cousins who witnessed that spirit let's call it, and it happened when she was really young. Once when she was around 6 or 7 and was spending her time at the house, even though she was a little girl she never feared anything and so she went to use the bathroom which at the back of the house. It was little late at night and everyone was ready to sleep. When she saw that my grandma was in just the other room, she decided to use the bathroom and when she was coming back she suddenly saw some man in the lawn. She described the man tall as in very tall, wearing all white kurta (Long shirt type garment) with an orange turban. I do not know what the figure did or it did nothing, but apparently she started screaming and my concerned grandma came running to see what was wrong. According to my mum, she was unwell for a little while fever from maybe what she saw. Some also rule it out to be nothing but a child's imagination but you guys will later on understand why it was not her imagination.\n\nAfter that mostly people never saw it for a long time or maybe people from that house became ignorant of the fact that their might be something lurking at the back of the house which is not human.\n\nMy mother being the second youngest among her 6 siblings- 2 boys and 4 girls, she was one of the last people to get married in the household. One day when she was back home with my grandma and her grandma, and all of them were sleeping in the living room. After midnight suddenly my mother felt as if someone was literally sitting on her and she was unable to move. As a reflex she opened her eyes and saw some blurry black figure staring back at her and when she wanted to call my grandma her mother who was literally beside her, she was unable to do so. She wanted to scream but could't and it was not a situation you want to be stuck in. After sometime she says she fell asleep and next day thought of it as just a nightmare. But it has stuck to her, as she never once in all her childhood has faced such thing.\n\nThere was this tenant who rented the room at the back of the lawn at the extreme corner, she and her family of 3 were the very few people over the years who experienced something unnatural in that place. I heard that she after few years of staying in the room started having unnatural hallucinations and she randomly started shouting at the night. This went on till they left the house and last we heard of them she was pregnant at the time she left the house and she had a son after already having one daughter.\n\nLet me tell an interesting theory here, some people have always said that something was wrong with the room at the backside but my grandma and family never had a strong enough reason to leave the house. Over the years when one of my older aunt as in my uncle's wife got pregnant second time after having a daughter, she unexpectedly had an abortion, it was expected she was going to have a boy. But now she never had any more kids. My other uncle's wife who is the youngest among all the siblings went on and had three daughters, and an stillborn son. They stay in the same room at the back of the house where there were renters previously. Many people when my aunt was pregnant with the boy asked her to leave the room and go to her mother's house for the delivery but she never listened to any of it. She had some complications at the time of the delivery and had to lose the baby. Some theories about the spirit in the back suggests that, he does not like boys to be born in the household. And let me get this straight my grandma and her family moved in the house when my mother was little and my grandma was already pregnant with my youngest uncle. So there goes chances that why now and why not with my uncles.\n\nNow it is my turn to tell what happened with me. My grandma's living room has a big portrait of Goddess in our culture. One day after coming home from school, I was taking a nap on the sofa in the living room and suddenly I have a dream or nightmare I have no idea. The portrait in the room has turned to some other figure I cannot exactly explain. When I woke up from that and ran to my grandma as I was feeling breathless, she said that my face was totally red and I looked very restless. I cannot explain how I feel about the one and only incident I faced in that house. But after that day I know there was actually something in that house.\n\nWe in our culture strongly believe that if there is a religious event going on, these dark entities cannot mess that up, to my surprise, at the time of one of such event, we felt that there was something that is stopping us from going further. It has tried its best to hinder throughout event and even went out of its way by cutting of the electricity. Why I am saying that it has something to do with electricity is because whole street in that area all had their electricity expect for my grandma's house.\n\nAfter some days, I was baby sitting my youngest cousins, daughter's of my youngest uncle. My aunt and uncle had some commitments which they could't back out and my grandma was out at her brother's house. I was in the next room to that room at the back of the house I always mention. I after my incident had never felt it again. So when my little cousin came running to me crying her eyes out that she saw a man on the swing which is just in the lawn and in front of the very room I was sitting. So to say that I was shocked to hear her description of the man, the same wearing all white kurta (Long shirt type garment) with an orange turban and being very tall. Hearing that chills run down my spine. I have never felt so uneasy in my whole life but still to calm her down I said there was no one there but she started crying even more and saying that I am not listening to her. I some how calmed her down and took both her and her elder sister to my grandma's room. Throughout the day I observed that she was not playing nor she spoke anything else. \n\nTo make a connection, I will tell you guys that my oldest cousin is almost 20 years older to my youngest cousin and also there was no chance for my youngest cousin to hear the story my oldest cousin had said because she was not even born at that time we heard the story. It felt unsettling that both had described the exact same man without any slight variations.\n\nEven today when I recall the incident with my youngest cousin, I get goosebumps and my eyes water for some unexplained reason. \n\nI used to often visit my grandma even after that but never had any such incidents, I don't know if my uncles and grandma experience any such thing still, but when you look at the house from outside it is just like any normal house but only people who have experienced such incidents know that there is something definitely haunting my grandma's house.",

        "text": "Well, I’m back again everyone.\n\nFirstly, I want to express that this story, though it may be short, is too long to post onto any subreddit because of an unaddressed bug for iOS devices, so therefore, I have to break it up into multiple posts. Ugh….\n\nAnyway…\n\nI recently posted something that happened to me entitled “The Devil at my Door.”\n\nI’ve had some apparent interest in the story via dms and I didn’t really expect it to even get a single upvote but hey, I’ll take it.\n\nEver since that fateful encounter with the devil, I have been haunted and followed by spirits, so I figured I might as well post another encounter with something demonic.\n\nMy ex-girlfriend and I decided to go to my hometown of Reno Nevada for our vacation.\n\nLet’s call her Carolina for privacy purposes.\n\nCarolina had never really seen the snow as she was born and raised in LA.\n\nI hadn’t seen my family since I moved to LA five years prior, so it seemed like the thing to do.\n\nWhen my band used to tour, I used an app a lot called “Hotel Tonight”.\n\nBasically you swoop up a room for half off, give or take. I think it had to do with last minute cancellations or whatever.\n\nI never had an issue with the app and I raved about it to my musician friends.\n\nThat was the last time I would ever use the app and now I gladly pay full price for rooms when I need them.\n\nHere’s why.\n\nThe app located a room at the Circus Circus casino downtown.\n\nThe casino always creeped me out because it was in the realm of liminal spaces. \n\nThe midway was always empty perpetually. There were scattered arcades with the machines all flashing and making noise, but no children anywhere to be found.\n\nThe concierge informed us that we would be in room 316 on the 16th floor. \n\nUpon arriving at our room, we both immediately noticed the macabre and downright satanic paintings that adorned every wall.\n\nThey were a lot of headless clowns and ball shaped entities stuck behind cages, juggling that kind of looked like tweedle dee and tweedle dum from Alice in wonderland.\n\nThere were even baphomet looking goat men entities depicted in several of the paintings.\n\nThe creatures in the paintings were all seemingly in various states of bondage.\n\n“Nope!” Carolina said.\n\nShe tried to remove a painting but found it was tightly attached to the wall with nails or super glue.\n\nI tried to do the same thing and found that the paintings were not going anywhere.\n\nWe took all the clean towels and covered the macabre paintings and collapsed into bed.\n\nThat night I had the worst sleep paralysis episode I had ever had.\n\nI just remember that I was sitting up in bed, looking at the door to our room because something was behind the door that made me bolt up and start sweating, despite the brumal chill that came over the room. \n\nThe sound of as like a cat scratching to be let inside.\n\nSuddenly the door burst open violently and there was an apparition of an elderly woman in a pure white evening gown. \n\nShe was levitating about a couple feet off the ground. Her eyes were white like a severely blind old dog.\n\nBelow her there were snake like lizards that made figure eights, chasing each others tails in some ritualistic undulating circle.\n\nThe apparition floated to the foot of my bed. Her arms were outstretched in front of her, shoulder height like Frankenstein and the lizards followed her wherever she went.\n\nThe old woman began shrieking like a banshee and the room filled with blinding white light.\n\nNext I’m laying in bed screaming and  Carolina is shaking me out of my vivid and lucid sleep paralysis.\n\nShe was terrified. \n\nI sprung out of bed and ran to the door to see if it was still locked.\n\nWe tried to shrug it off and return to bed but the room was so I cold I was expecting to see my own breath.\n\nCarolina pointed out that something sounded like it was scratching the window lightly and a distended humanoid shadow was cast across the wall. \n\nI opened the curtains to see if it may be hail making the noise as we were way too high up for it to be anything else.\n\nThe shadow figure would vanish each time I yanked the blinds open but it and the scratching would manifest again a few minutes later each time.\n\nThe thermostat said the room was 80 degrees and we had the cranked to no avail. It would get progressively colder and colder each night until exactly sunrise and then it seemed the heater would finally function properly.\n\nSo, I gave up on sleeping but my girlfriend slept well into the afternoon. \n\nI called down for more towels but nobody came so after an hour I took the one down that we had hung over easily the must unnerving painting in the whole room. \n\nJust above the toilet was the saddest sack of shit wino clown that appeared to have the wounds of Christ in its wrists and of course, just behind the clown was like a wendigo or skinwalker entity that I hadn’t noticed initially.\n\nRegarding the painting, my girlfriend took pictures of all of them just because she knew that no one back home would believe that they were real. Also, they were so complicated that it’s truly hard to describe exactly what was going on in each one. The best comparison I could make was if Hieronymus Bosch used oil paints and charcoal on an average sized canvas and had a hard on for clowns.\n\nAfter a year or so, she and I both felt that the photos of the paintings should be deleted as we both experienced frequent sleep paralysis the following year or so. Part of me regrets that decision. \n\nOh well.\n\nIt was 2016 so it didn’t help that it was that year where disturbing clowns were popping up all over to the point where McDonald’s nixed Ronald McDonald for good.\n\nSo, there I am in the shower with my back to Clowny McAntichrist and I’m feeling distinctly like I’m being watched. \n\nI allow myself to revisit my nightmare from the night before but suddenly there was only one thing I could think about…\n\nThe disembodied, Krusty the Clown cartoonish laughter that suddenly manifested near my right ear.\n\nI yanked the shower in the direction I thought was off and ended up scalding my neck and butt and almost completely ate it. \n\nI pulled the shower curtain open from the other side and searched the entire room for whatever made that noise.\n\nAt this point, I was convinced that it was my turn to go crazy seeing as my older brother lost his mind around the same age. That’s another story but he is a homeless schizophrenic meth head who talks to himself and went full on Syd Barret with out any prior indication of mental health problems.\n\nHeartbreaking as my brothers descent into madness was, I was selfishly more afraid of waking up one day just as insane as he is.\n\nI couldn’t tell Carolina what I was experiencing. If I was losing it, she is the last one I would want to find out about it.\n\nWe went to a dinner show thing at a Japanese restaurant called Ichiban.\n\nOur cook was awful. \n\nHe kept tossing onions into his hat and missing the mark. He dropped his spatulas like five times while attempting to juggle and flustered, he served everyone the wrong dishes.\n\nIt was Carolinas birthday and the staff sang happy birthday to another Korean girl sitting at our table and called her Carolina.\n\nI never needed a drink so bad in my life.",

        "text": "Hearing people talk about the [Hungry Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10hv1l0/the_hungry_man_is_not_a_myth/) in these recent posts gave me some major flashbacks, so I figured I’d share my own experience. \n\nThis was back in the mid 90s in Tempe, Arizona. After I pulled straight C’s my freshman year of college, my dad told me to try working for a living, so the next year I ended up in the kitchen at a burger place, this local chain called Burger Ranch. \n\nOne of my least favorite parts of the job was tossing expired food, especially in the 110 degree heat. To be blunt, we wasted a lot of stuff. A couple of times a day, I’d find myself lugging bags full of cold fries or expired tomatoes out to the dumpster.\n\nNow, what made this a hundred times worse, is that I was told not to use the dumpster in the alley behind the restaurant. This wasn’t a rule from management, but more like a tip from the old hands. When I asked them why, they really didn’t want to talk about it.\n\nI’d end up hauling these heavy buckets of sour milkshake mix or whatever else had gone bad like two blocks away to a shared dumpster of a KFC that belonged to the same franchise owner. \n\nOne super hot night the power went out. No one noticed until the next morning. By then *everything* was bad. We had maybe a hundred pounds of pink burger sludge wrapped in plastic that stunk like cat food.\n\nWell, guess whose job it was to toss everything?\n\nAt first, I used the far away dumpster like usual, but even by 9:00 it was already well over 100 out, and my uniform was fully soaked in sweat. So at some point, I basically said screw it.\n\nFor the next load, I hauled out about 50 pounds of raw meat in a trash bag and approached the closer dumpster. Even as I did, I could imagine my dad watching me and muttering something about how I was always cutting corners. Like when I used to wash his car, and he’d *always* find a spot I missed. \n\nAs I hauled the meat, I noticed a couple of stray dogs watching me. A mutt and a pit bull. I thought about just tossing them the food and letting them go nuts, but I didn’t want them to get sick or something.\n\nAs I entered the alley, I saw him for the first time: the Hungry Man was sitting in the shadow of a fence, staring up at me with hollow eyes.\n\nAt first, I thought he was a corpse. I’d never seen anyone even *close* to that skinny before. His bones looked ready to pop right through his skin at the lightest touch.\n\n“So hungry,” he said. I couldn’t tell if he was talking to me or to himself.\n\n“Sorry, bud,” I told him. \n\nI think I’m probably one of the only ones to see him shirtless. He was covered in stretch marks from his neck all the way down to his belt. But the thing that really threw me off was his belly button. It was just this big, dark hole. Like it went all the way through his spine to the inner skin of his back.\n\nI tried to avoid eye contact as I walked past him and approached the dumpster. I’d never seen anything like it. This thing was pristine, like it had just been dropped off from the dumpster factory. Well, I was about to mess that up. I tossed the bags in, and they exploded when they hit the bottom, sending a spray of beef sludge over the entire interior.\n\nWhen I came back with the next load, the Hungry Man was gone, which I figured was a good thing. I had two massive bags, but they were full of lettuce, so not quite as heavy. I walked over to the dumpster and opened the lid. \n\nInside was totally clean. There wasn’t a speck of the beef sludge I’d splattered there two minutes earlier. I looked around. Was I still in the same place? Yes. This was definitely the same dumpster. Looking closer, I noticed a kind of wet sheen covering the dumpster’s inside, like it had been licked clean.\n\n“So hungry,” I heard behind me. “All alone.”\n\nI looked back and fucking panicked. There was the Hungry Man, except he wasn’t skinny now. He was fat as hell, like an inflated balloon. How the hell had he gotten so close to me? \n\nI looked up and down that alley. He was right. There wasn’t anyone in sight. Noon in Arizona is like midnight anywhere else: you’re only outside if you have to be or you’re looking for trouble.\n\nHe opened his mouth to lick his lips, and I swear to god, he had a second row of teeth behind the first one. They kind of looked like a line of molars, running across the roof of his mouth.\n\nHe took a step toward me. It was faster than I’ve ever seen a guy that size move, and when his foot landed it made a thud that rattled the dumpster.\n\n“So hungry,” he said again, his eyes never leaving my neck. \n\nI looked behind me. The alley stretched maybe 200 feet before it connected with the main street, but I was definitely no athlete.\n\nHe took a step closer, and I could smell the beef sludge on his breath. I figured it was now or never.\n\nSo I tossed both bags of lettuce up in the air. One flew open, sending down a snowstorm of wilted lettuce everywhere. Then I turned and ran. As I did, I listened for the sound of thumps behind me, but they never came. Instead, there was a weird squelching.\n\nI’d almost reached the street when I looked back to see the Hungry Man on the ground, munching up the last of the lettuce that had fallen. Then he picked up the other bag and started to eat it, plastic and all. This was a full garbage bag. And it was gone in maybe twenty seconds. As he ate, I swore his body seemed to expand, like a water balloon attached to a tap.\n\nThat’s when he started coming at me. He didn’t bother standing up. He galloped on all fours like a fucking horse toward me. He must have covered the length of the alley in two seconds. And I guarantee I would have been the next thing down his throat if not for the dog. \n\nThis pit bull I’d spotted earlier approached from behind me, growling nervously at the Hungry Man, summing him up. And then it went for his throat.\n\nThe Hungry Man moved faster. He grabbed the pit bull out of midair and held it up by its hind legs like a dead rabbit. Then he bit off its head in two bites, his teeth chewing right through the bones like they were a croissant or something. That dog was gone in five seconds, like it had never even been there.\n\nI sprinted for the street, even as I heard the thunder of his steps behind me. I crossed four lanes of busy fucking traffic. Almost got hit twice. But I made it. And when I looked back across the street behind me, he was gone.\n\nI guess we all have our close calls, and overall, I got off light. The only lasting damage is that I *hate* taking out the trash. I won’t even do it alone. I’ve told my wife what happened, but she doesn’t believe me.\n\n“Admit it,” she says, holding my free hand as we walk out to the side of the house. “You just like my company.”\n\nAs I throw the trash into the can, she turns away.\n\n“That’s pretty foul,” she says. “You might want to hose out the inside.”\n\nBut I shake my head. Because there’s a reassurance to stink. The grime means he hasn’t been there. But it’s hard to explain that to people sometimes, so I just mumble, “Sometimes dirty is best. Clean is overrated.” \n\nAnd then we close the lid and head back [inside](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).",

        "text": "When Jamil washed up on shore, nobody knew what to think. She was horrendously beautiful, tragically perfect, and in more ways than anyone could begin to fathom, she was what we all feared to accept.\n\nYou can search the internet for information on her, but you won’t find it, albeit this momentary posting of it, yet I feel like even this won’t last long here; so many people have tried to tell her story, share pictures or videos of her existence, but everything we’ve attempted to expose gets erased from history, along with those who try to tell the world of our own slice of the truth. \n\nI should explain who … or better yet, *what* exactly Jamil is and when she was discovered. Firstly, I live in a small town located on an almost equally small island, which without saying is a fishing town. Our main export is Atlantic crab and scallops, along with assorted farm goods. We have a population of about three hundred people, and we live … *lived* peacefully as close knit as we could possibly be. Trawlers and other fishing boats left and entered port daily, bringing in the day's catch and taking them to the mainland for distribution. We were quiet, we were happy.\n\nWe were hardly even known. And then we found Jamil.\n\nJust over a year ago, as one of the early morning fishermen were rising from the few hours of slumber, wiping the sands of dreams from their eyes and beginning their adventure to the seas and beyond, one of the captains had called a few of his deck hands to hurry to the shoreline as he could see what he believed was a beached whale. It wasn’t long upon the men nearing the creature for them to realise it wasn’t even close to that.\n\nThey couldn’t explain what they were looking at when they called the captain back.\n\n“It was like looking at the devil himself, and mother god all in one.” said Johannes Strauss, one of the deckhands as he recounted his experience to the bar patrons that night. “It was as if she found herself upon our shores by accident,” he continued, “and we were all too arrogant to save her that morning.”\n\nWe all found ourselves at one point or another that day on the shoreline discovering the treacherous beauty that was Jamil. My husband was there before me; our neighbours were the ones who broke the news to us, and he was more than curious to discover what had found itself on our shore. I, on the other hand, was more hesitant. The thought of seeing dead sea life didn’t really stir any excitement within me. \n\n“You don’t understand, Marianne,” my husband said after returning home, his breath short and ragged, “she is amazing, she’s pure. You won’t feel this feeling ever in your life until you experience her.”\n\nThat was enough to pique my curiosity. My husband was always the silent type, never one to truly show emotion under normal circumstance, so to see him this worked up over something that had washed up on our island? I knew it had to be worth seeing.\n\nIt was *so much more* than that.\n\nJamil, which I should explain, got her name from the townsfolk, as the captain of the ship who had caught sight of her was Jagmeet Jamil, one of the island's oldest and most respected citizens. \n\nNow, when I arrived on the shore that day, nothing prepared me for the absolute tidal wave of emotions and utter realisations I would face. When I had first lay my eyes upon her, the very instant she had come into my line of sight, I immediately understood how meek and unimportant our existence is as a race on this planet, or even in this entire universe. I saw every possible future for me, every way I could possibly die. I saw creatures that live just beyond the resonating frequency of our world, ones that would tear us apart by simply breathing. I saw whole realities crumble beneath the weight of Jamil’s existence both before, in pasts unknown, and yet to come, in futures that may never come. I saw a darkness so thick that it crushed my mind, I saw a light that burned so bright it would consume our very sun without struggle. The sheer sight of Jamil had sent shockwaves of truth through me, hurling existential dread and terror through me, yet simultaneously releasing me of all of my previous fears and anxieties. It was as if looking at her gave me the same feeling a newborn has when they finally look upon their parents and acknowledge that they are both their creators and their protectors. There was this radiant resonance  to her that was telling me I was safe, until she deemed me otherwise.\n\nAnd yet, I stayed of sound mind and body as I looked upon her.\n\nTo explain what Jamil looked like physically with words won’t do her true justice, but I will do everything I can to do so.\n\nShe was a mass of eyeballs and snake like tendrils, consuming themselves and creating more all at once. Long, squid like tentacles lay dormant at what we believed was the bottom of her, sometimes writhing. A low sound that sounded like a distant scream would escape from her once in a while, as if she were in agony from finding herself in our existence, and merely being in our reality was causing her immense pain. She was larger than a humpback whale, and her eyes were innumerable. At some points, it seemed as if her mass was trying to create body parts, like arms or fins or even sometimes large wings, yet they would either melt away or be consumed by her. She was trying so hard for us to understand that she didn’t mean us harm, but the pain she was going through was halting all of her attempts. \n\nLooking back at that day, I think she wanted us to kill her, to help her move on from this place to another, but we were all too enamoured with her to think of harming her. \n\nJamil was our angel, and we wanted to protect her at all costs.\n\nThe following days were so strange to all of us. It was almost as if overnight, our island was overrun by militia and government workers we have never seen before. A surveying area was built around Jamil, and all boat work was halted until further notice. We were stuck in time, frozen in place as we observed the observers who began to poke and prod at something that had no right being treated in such a way. A few people tried to fight back, revolting against the army as they built their observation area around Jamil, but they were all met with extreme, sometimes even lethal, force. It was just as fast that we realised we were doing more harm to ourselves by fighting against these people.\n\nFor three months they observed her, ran tests on her, cut her open and took samples from her, until one day without warning, they just disappeared. \n\nSome people swear they heard screams coming from the observation area, others say they saw Jamil attacking the soldiers with her tentacles, even consuming them as she pleased. All I know is that one day as I awoke and went to the pier to see if I could see past the tents and the towers, I had found an empty pier. \n\nThere were no scientists. No army. There was nothing. The only thing that was left was an indent in the sand where she had lay. The sane was twisted and contorted, its very make-up altered by Jamil resting upon it. The spot remained unmoved for the past year, the sands a darker shade than the area around it. \n\nWe renamed that shore area Jamil’s Rest. \n\nShe deserves to be known, her existence should be in our history books and yet someone out there still doesn’t want our story being told. Everyone who’s tried to tell this tale ends up missing, all evidence of their existence completely wiped out. It makes me wonder how many other times has Jamil visited here, or how many others there could be. \n\nI’ve heard people talking, the general consensus believes it’s a government cover up. Others believe that Jamil is thanking us one by one and bringing us to wherever it is she calls home.\n\nAll I know is regardless of what happens from here on, I’m not afraid.",

I told you we're not interested. Now fuck off before I drop you right here and now!\" The Black-eyed man halted abruptly again and snapped his head to look at Nolan. His vulpine grin dropped and instantly morphed itself into a scowl before his pointing his fingers in an \"evil eye\" gesture at him and blasting the most inhuman sort of bellow I'd ever heard. Imagine hearing every creature on the planet, man and animal, screaming at the same time while coming from the mouth of a dragon, that's the best way I can describe the sound the man made.\n\nIt all happened instantaneously. I closed my eyes and covered my ears. The Black-eyed man's demon screech continued ringing in my ears, but I still heard Nolan's screams cutting through. Faint, but there, nonetheless. My eyes opened to see that the other two had him pinned to the ground. Nolan wrestled furiously against them, but he might as well have been laying perfectly still for as much good as it did him. I made to rush for him, to help him or... or I don't know, *something*, but whenever I did, I couldn't make my muscles move an inch.\n\nIt was like I was somehow frozen by the man's voice. I don't just mean by fear or anything, either, but rather like the guy's voice was somehow hypnotizing my muscles or maybe blocking my mind's connection with my body. Think about a computer being remotely accessed. You see it happening right in front of you, you know it's happening, and you can't do a damn thing to stop it. That's exactly what this was, my mind was a computer being hacked, essentially.\n\nThe two hooded figures jabbed a needle into Nolan's neck, putting him to sleep in less than seconds. I kept pushing myself to do something. I didn't care what, but *something*, to just *move*, but it was useless. The whole time this was happening, too, Black-Eyed man stared directly at me, grinning in this shark-like manner, showing off an impossible amount of razor-like teeth on both the top and bottom of his jaws.\n\nAs he did this, too, I could hear them, all of them, call out to me, saying, *\"Join us in the End, Hank... He's waiting...\"* The two figures arose, each taking up one of Nolan's arms in one hand. Still frozen, I watched them begin dragging my friend down the street. The Black-Eyed man held out his arm in a summoning gesture to me again and said, *\"Take my hand, child.\"*\n\nShaking, I saw my hand start to raise on its own. This time, though, my own mind started to take the wheel again and I forced my arm to go back down. Seeing this, Black-Eyed man's smile dropped again into that scowl from before. My body seized up, expecting him to blast out another sort of gathering call or whatever to sic his two cronies on me like they had with Nolan, but he didn't. He just stood there, glaring a me before smiling again and moving backwards in the direction the other two went, still facing me with his arm still outstretched toward me.\n\nI stood there, watching him disappear into the distance. This time it *was* fright alone that caused me to remain frozen stiff for at least a good ten minutes or so. When I finally managed to break from entropy, the first thing I did was break off into a sprint for the nearest neighbor's house. I remember hammering like a maniac on the door. When the old, haggard looking guy answered the door, I instantly broke into a panic, dumping everything that'd just happened onto him while he stood there, tiredly staring at me like I was fucking crazy.\n\n\"Sir, please, you gotta help!\" I cried. He didn't say or do anything, just continued eyeing me like nothing I'd told him meant a damn thing to him. I sighed then and just settled for asking if I could just use his phone. He sighed and told me to make it quick. I ran inside, grabbed the phone, and smashed the 9-1-1 buttons.\n\n**-- \"911 Operator, what is your emergency?\"**\n\n\\-- \"Hello? M-My friend's j-just been kidnapped by--\"\n\nMy mind was running a hundred miles a second. I couldn't focus on a damn thing I was supposed to say.\n\n**-- \"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to calm down and speak clearly, okay?\"**\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\n\\-- \"O-Okay...\"\n\n**-- \"May I have your name and current location?\"**\n\n\\-- \"My name's Hank Resner. I'm in Creekdale Dr. My friend's been abducted in the street.\"\n\n**-- \"Alright Hank. Are you somewhere safe right now?\"**\n\n\\-- \"Y-Yeah, I'm in a neighbor's house closeby.\"\n\n**-- \"And what's this location's address?\"**\n\n\\-- \"Uhh...\"\n\nI covered the receiver and turned to the guy. Whispering, I asked him, \"Hey, what this address?\" He raised his eyebrow at me. I pointed to the phone and he sighed in annoyance. I'm guessing he wasn't a big fan of cops at the house, likely due to the messy, borderline hazardous looking state the inside of the place was in. Regardless, he gave me the address and I relayed it to the operator.\n\n**-- \"Alright, I've dispatched a unit to your location. You said you are somewhere safe, correct?\"**\n\n\\-- \"Y-Yes ma'am.\"\n\n**-- \"Good, and is there anyone with you?\"**\n\n\\-- \"Yes ma'am, the owner of the house.\"\n\n**-- \"Alright, the unit should be there in about two minutes. I want you to remain inside until they get there, okay?\"**\n\n\\-- \"Y-Yes ma'am.\"\n\nI hung up after that. Ironically in a way, I could almost hear the sirens coming while she was actually telling me this. They showed up in the guy's driveway just a minute and a half later. I ran outside to meet them, where I more or less did with them the same as what I did with the guy before by belting everything out that happened in a frenzy. Just like the guy and the operator, both, the officer looked at me confused before telling me to slow down. I couldn't help it. Every second that passed, I knew, was another second that Nolan spent having God only knew what being done to him by those freaks.\n\n\"Look, me and Nolan were just walking down the street over there,\" I pointed to the area of the street where we'd been, \"when these three guys in hoods came up to us and attacked him.\"\n\n\"Did you see any of their faces?\" he asked. \"Any of them remove their hoods or anything, maybe in the struggle?\"\n\n\"Y-Yeah...\" I shuddered. The officer looked attentively at me. \"H-He was thin, bald, and had black eyes.\"\n\n\"Black eyes?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yeah, like *pitch black*. He had sharp looking teeth, too, and--\" He stopped me.\n\n\"Okay, and where did you say these people went with your friend?\" I pointed down the other side of the street. \"Down toward the edge of the neighborhood where the cemetery's at?\" I nodded, shaking. I thought then of the other bodies that were always found in there. He told me to stay where I was while he went to radio something to the dispatcher. I stood, quivering in raw terror.\n\nI looked in the distance. In the back of my mind -- at least that's what I *hoped* it was -- I could hear, just faintly, *\"Come with us, Hank...\"*\n\nThe officer came back soon after. \"Alright, son, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna take a ride with me to the station where we'll take your statement and have you help give us a composite sketch of the guy, okay?\" My eyes grew in alarm. He held up his hand, half-grinning, and remarked, \"Calm down, sport, you ain't in any trouble here, we just need your help.\"\n\n\"B-But my M-Mo--\"\n\n\"We've already contacted them, they'll be waiting for us down at the station.\" My body calmed down, though my brain and heart were both still kicked well into overdrive.\n\n\"Wh-What about Nolan? He's still out there, we have to--\" He held up his hand again.\n\n\"Again, it's being taken care of. We got a couple K-9 units looking into the place as we speak. If they *did* go there, the dogs'll catch 'em.\" I shivered for a moment, turning back to the distance. The officer's words were, of course, of little to absolutely no comfort to me. He gestured for me to get in the car and he drove us out of the neighborhood to the station.\n\nSure enough, he wasn't lying when he told me that my folks would be waiting for me there. Hell, I can still feel how tight Momma squeezed me when she ran up to hug me. \"Oh my God, are you okay, Hank?!\" she cried frantically.\n\n\"Y-Yeah, Momma, I-I'm fine.\" Admittedly, I knew even then I wasn't fooling anybody, let alone my mother with that bullshit, but I was also less worried about myself in any case. I was there, at the station, for my best chance at saving Nolan, not for me. The officer led us into the interrogation room and we sat down.\n\n\"So, start from the beginning. You were with your friend, yes?\" I nodded my head. \"What happened then?\"\n\n\"We were just walking down the street and--\"\n\n\"Where?\" I shrugged.\n\n\"N-Nowhere. We were just walking when they showed up.\"\n\n\"When who showed up?\"\n\n\"I-I don't know who they are.\"\n\n\"Okay, and did they say anything to you?\" I grimaced. I didn't want to answer this, not because I thought I'd be in trouble, but because I wasn't sure *what* to tell them.\n\n\"Come with me...\" I said in a hesitant whisper. He leaned in closer.\n\n\"Come again?\"\n\n\"He told me to come with him or something, I don't know...\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"The... The cemetery...\" My heart started jumping in my chest now. I felt Momma's arm wrap around me tightly.\n\n\"Hallowed Stone?\" he asked. I nodded. \"He say why?\"\n\n\"No. I don't know. He kept saying some shit like *\"Come join us in the end\"*, or something crazy like that.\" He furrowed his eyes at me for a moment before clearing his throat.\n\n\"Okay, so these people show up, tell you to come with them,\" he paused, looking at me with eyebrows raised, \"You don't, and then...\"\n\n\"He starts coming toward me, telling me to come with him.\"\n\n\"Did you try to run?\"\n\n\"N-No... I... I wanted to, but...\" I trailed off. My stomach began to turn. \"Nolan stepped in front of me, telling him to go away when they jumped him. I couldn't help him, either.\"\n\n\"Were any of them armed?\"\n\n\"They had a... a needle...\"\n\n\"A needle?\" he asked. I nodded.\n\n\"Yeah, and they used it to put Nolan to sleep before dragging him away.\"\n\n\"And that's when you ran to the neighbor's house to call us?\" I nodded. He nodded, then stood up. \"Wait here for a moment, I'll be right back.\" He then left the room and it was me and my parents.\n\nI turned to Momma. She had tears in her eyes.\"Momma, I--\" she cut me off by bear-hugging me tightly. I could hear her sobbing and Dad joined in, squeezing me even tighter. I said nothing then, just huddled myself close to her like I was four years old, watching a scary movie late at night again. Yeah, Noah, if you're reading this, this's your chance (Probably the last) to laugh at me for the same shit I gave you such a hard time over.\n\nAnyway, we stayed like this for about three minutes before the door opened again and in walked the officer and another holding a sketchbook and pencil. \"Okay, bud, now what I want you to do is try to tell us anything you can remember about them; how they were dressed, any marks, like scars or tattoos, anything like that. Think you can do that for me?\" I poked my head out from Momma's arms and nodded.\n\nTurning to the artist, I described, in vivd detail, the Black-Eyed man. In about 15 minutes, the artist had a damn near perfect likeness of him, admittedly causing a shiver to sprint down my back. Even just looking at a *drawing* of him caused me to faintly hear his deep, demonic voice again, beckoning me, commanding me, to come to the cemetery. \"This him?\" asked the artist.\n\nI nodded. \"Y-Yeah... Yeah, that's him.\"\n\n\"You sure?\" asked the officer. I nodded to him, unable to take my eyes away from the eyes on the drawing. The officer stood up again and nodded to the artist, who also stood up and made for the door. \"Alright then, thank you for your help. We'll be in touch, if you see anything, give us a call.\" he passed a card to Dad and looked at me, \"And in the meantime, Might I suggest staying indoors for a while? They might still be after you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Momma chimed in. The officer exchanged glances back and forth between me and her before clearing his throat.\n\n\"Well ma'am, it's possible that this little stunt was a ruse to lure your son here to Hallowed Stone.\" My heart stopped dead for at least the fourth time that day. Somehow, right up to the moment he said that, I hadn't even considered that.\n\n\"How do you know?\" asked Dad. \"I mean, why would they be targeting him?\"\n\n\"Why, I can't say, but this isn't the first time this particular situation's happened.\" I saw Momma's eyes double in size along with my own. \"You folks remember the incident a while back, Pastor Kincaid's daughter?\" They shakily nodded. \"Well, little known fact, but she wasn't ever found, and leading up to the incident that night, she'd already reported a few instances of people harassing her.\" He turned back to me and said, \"And from what your son's just told me, it sounds like this is the same people in his case as well, and if that's the case, it's possible he ain't done with you.\"\n\nHe turned and left the room after that. My mind was completely blank. The world felt like I was dreaming, like none of this was real. That suddenly, everything would be normal again, my friend would be home again, safe, and I wouldn't have some crazy cult or whatever the hell they were after me.\n\nThe three of us left and went home after that. The car ride was silent. A few times, I caught Dad and Momma both darting their eyes in the side and rear-view mirrors. I probably would've done so myself if my brain wasn't essentially a crashed computer, blank and hollow. Lifeless almost, completely numb to the world around me.\n\n*An empty vessel.*\n\n*\"Come join us, Hank...\"*\n\nI remember snapping my head around wildly. Looking around, nothing was there, nothing that wasn't supposed to be, if you take my meaning. Momma looked up to the rear-view mirror, \"You okay, honey?\"\n\n\"Um... I, uh...\"\n\n*\"Join us in the cemetery, Hank...\"*\n\n*\"Join us in the End...\"*\n\nMy head snapped to the right. \"What is it, you see something?\"\n\n\"N-No...\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" asked Dad.\n\n\"Nothing, I... I thought I heard something.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"It's nothing, I promi--\"\n\n*\"Hank, I'm so lonely, come with me...\"*\n\nMy head snapped to the right. This time it was Nolan's voice crying out to me. “Hank, what’s going on, talk to me, *please!*”\n\nI looked again at Momma. Her eyes were full to the brim with tears. It broke my heart to see her like this.\n\n*”Hank, don’t you love us? Aren’t you lonely without us?”*\n\nThis time it was Aunt Rosa’s voice, coming from the right. Two things happened then at the exact same time. I swung my head in the direction of Aunt Rosa’s voice at the exact same time Dad swings the car over to the right of the road. The car came to a screeching halt that sent whiplash through all three of us.\n\nFor a moment, we were all stuck in a state of shock, adrenaline running rampant through all three of us, prompting us to want to go into a frenzy, yet being too out of your own damn mind to move a single muscle. Dad was the first to break, looking around at both me and Momma. “Are y’all okay?” Both of us just looked at him, blank and panic-stricken.\n\nAttention was then refocused to the passenger side window, facing the road. Directly in front of us, staring straight through the window, was one of the hooded figures. My eyes doubled in size. *Oh Jesus, he’s RIGHT on top of me!*\n\nDad blared the horn. “Hey buddy, come on, you can’t have the whole fuckin’ road!” He just remained a statue outside of the window. Dad blared the horn again. Nothing.\n\nDad started unbuckling his seat belt, grumbling under his breath. Without even thinking, I shot out my arm, “Dad, wait, don’t!” He paused for a moment, raising his eyebrow at me. “He-He’s one of them.”\n\nHis eye darted back and forth between me and the window. “He’s one of the guys that took Nolan, Dad.” Both his and Momma’s faces drained of color as they stared back to face the figure in the window. The figure slowly moved, raising its right hand to the window in a gesturing manner.\n\n“Wh-what’s he doing?” Momma asked, shaking. Dad put his hand on her shoulder, not taking his eye off the figure.\n\n“Stay here, don’t move.” He opened the door and stepped out before I could stop him again. Momma quickly clicked the locks on the doors. I blankly watched him stomp over to the passenger side of the car. The figure stayed still, staring through the window, not at all noticing Dad, even when he began shaking their shoulder.\n\nMy heart began cutting cartwheels, hearing Aunt Rosa and Nolan’s, as well as a few other people’s voices again. They were even louder, though, clearer, almost *deafening*! All of it seemed to be coming from the hooded guy himself. I slowly shrank down in my seat, as if that would somehow keep me from being seen.\n\n*”You know you have to come, Hank...”*\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. *Stop it, I’m not going, leave me alone!*\n\n*”Alone?”* I hear Nolan’s voice cry out. *“You are alone, Hank.”*\n\nI then hear Aunt Rosa chime in, *”We are together, Hank. We are, all of us, one in The End.”*\n\nI hear voices I didn’t even recognize, all of them children, start calling out to me. *”Come on, Hank!”* I heard them cry. *”Come with us into the End, Hank.”* My head shook violently. I hear them surrounding me, all centering from the window.\n\n*Stop it! Go away!*\n\nThe figure had his hand up in the window, curling his fingers in a beckoning motion. *”Take our hand, Hank. Come to the cemetery...”*\n\nMy attention was snapped back to reality at the sound of Momma’s shriek of terror. I looked to see her facing the window, watching Dad get the absolute shit stomped out of him by the figure, along with a newcomer who I hadn’t even seen beforehand. Dad was twitching on the ground, coughing up blood. “Dad!” I cried, fumbling frantically with the door handle.\n\n“Wait, Hank, don’t!” But it was too late. I was bounding out from the back seat, hurling myself like a panther into the one repeatedly stomping Dad’s chest in. It did absolutely nothing and, from what I could tell, despite being as rail thin as he looked, the son of a bitch wasn’t even budged an *inch*!\n\nHe continued hammering his foot down on my father’s chest while his partner delivered a swift kick straight to his nose that, from the sickening *crack* I heard immediately afterward, snapped his neck. His head lolled like rubber to his left side staring at me with glazed eyes that were forever frozen in a state of shock. “Dad!”\n\nI looked up to see the hooded figures now aim their focus at me. The one directly in front of me extended his hand and once again, I heard, *”He will be delivered unto the end. Join us. Take our hand, child.”*\n\nNow, more so than the last time, I found myself mesmerized by the voice. I couldn’t’t understand why — hell, I couldn’t tell you *now*, decades later — but *something* in it caused me to become completely paralyzed where I stood. *”Come on... you can be with us. All of us.”*\n\nIn a mix of all the voices, I heard, *”We are one, in the End!”* I wanted to cover my ears. I wanted to shout, scream, *something*. I couldn’t, and I was stuck, an ejected consciousness, almost, staring through an empty shell that was my body. It almost didn’t at all register to me that my feet were actually moving forward, bringing myself closer and closer to the hooded figure in front of me.\n\nOne step, then another, and then another. Time slowed to a complete stop. Nothing my body did was of any will or action of mine. *”Come, Hank.”* I hear Aunt Rosa’s voice say. *”Come with us to Hallowed Stone, to the End.”* My body takes another step forward.\n\nIn Nolan’s voice, I hear, *”Come be with us, Hank. Join us in the End.”* I took another step to the figure. My arm unconsciously raises up toward his. I’m about a foot away from him now. I’m about to do it, about to take his hand, when I felt my arm get roughly jerked backward toward the car.\n\nMy head snaps over to see Momma. She pulled me close, bear hugging me, covering me with her arms. The figure took another step forward, not lowering his hand. Momma started backing us up toward the car. For some reason, I couldn't make my feet want to cooperate. God knows every OTHER part of me did, but I just *wouldn't move*. Momma jerked me and I was pulled to the car.\n\nShe began shoving me into the car. I stiffly watched the figure approaching her from behind. She didn't notice him. I could see him getting closer and closer. I stayed staring into his hooded face, into his extended hand. *\"Come with us, Hank...\"*\n\nHe came about half a foot away from Momma when I finally got my mouth to open and I was gonna cry out to warn her, but it was too late. In seconds, he had Momma by the hair, forcefully jerking her away. I was frozen in the car, numbly watching as the two figures proceeded to stomp her into the road just like they had with Dad.\n\nI could hear her crying out in pain with each blow after blow to her face, stomach, arms, *everywhere*. They were relentless. All of this, and I couldn't do a goddamned thing but watch. I know I keep saying it, but my body wouldn't move, no matter how hard I tried, how much I *desperately* tried, I WOULD NOT MOVE! I *couldn't.*\n\nUnlike my father, these two weren't content with stomping Momma into the ground. No, they sought to use her as their next sacrifice. They rolled her over onto her back before one of them revealed a small blade and cut her shirt open, revealing her bare chest. Momma wasn't moving, except to writhe slightly from left to right. The figure raised the knife high into the air while the other proceeded to position her in a way that had her in the something like the shape of a star.\n\nThe one holding the knife was staring right at me. I couldn't see his face, sure, but I could knew he was looking at me. I'm almost willing to bet money he was *grinning* at me behind that hood. I could hear the voices from him, too, all of them, all coming from him.\n\n*\"We take thy body, that is thy vessel.\"* The figure plunged the knife downward, square in the area just above her navel. Momma's body thrusted upward reflexively upon impact, her eyes doubling in size as she began gasping desperately for breath. I watched the figure then start sliding the blade down her stomach in a straight line, pulling it out once reaching just below her chest. *\"We take thy spirit, that is thy mortality.\"*\n\nMomma's eyes locked onto mine. I could see it in her eyes, the beckoning. The silent pleading, begging. I didn't move. The knife came down again, this time just to the right of her left shoulder and was dragged all the way across her chest until connecting with the tip of the previous cut. Blood was now water falling from the front of her and her frantic gasping intensified. Her eyes were bugging, still fixed on me.\n\n*\"Help me, Hank...\"* I could almost hear her say, among the rest of the voices surrounding my mind that seemed to be keeping my limbs locked in perpetual entropy. *\"Save me!\"*\n\n*(\"I can't! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry momma, but I can't move!\")*\n\n*\"We take thy blood, that is thy life.\"* declared the figure before finally plunging the knife down for the final time in the other shoulder. This time I could hear Momma let out a pitiful cry of pain, with her body seizing and convulsing upward for a second before relaxing back on the ground again. I saw her eyes flutter, still trying to hold onto life, still pleading to me. I remained perfectly still. Neither my mind nor body reacted to any of this. I could neither think nor move. I was *empty!*\n\nBoth of the figures raised up from Momma's bleeding body before raising their hands to the air and proclaiming, *We take thy heart, that is thy purity, to join us all, in The End!\"* That last line, I could hear an echo to it, like if it was coming from a crowd of people, all at once. The one then raised the knife again, like he was about to use it on my mother again, when out of nowhere, I hear a deep voice shout, \"FREEZE!\"\n\nThe figures snapped their heads to look to the right of them where the voice came from. This, for some reason, caused my head to turn as well, though I could tell that it was done out a reflex that wasn't exactly my own, if that makes any sense. Basically, it was like my mind was somehow linked with theirs, and so therefore when *their* attention was shifted to it, so was mine. Confusing, believe me, I know, but its ironically the only thing that made sense for me to explain why I wasn't responsive; why I wasn't running away -- both before or now -- and most importantly, why I didn't so much as lift a finger when I was watching my parents get brutalized right in fucking front of me.\n\nThe voice shouted again, \"Drop the weapon and get on the ground, arms and legs spread. NOW!\" Neither of them moved. \"I'm not gonna ask again, drop the weapon and--\"\n\nQuicker than I could blink, the one holding the knife hurled it in the direction of the officer, nailing him in his shoulder. Instantly, the officer reeled in pain, but not before firing two reflex shots which, sure as hell, actually managed to hit one of the figures in the chest. He was knocked to the ground and his body immediately went lifeless. When this happened, for at least a good five seconds, I could hear over a thousand collective deafening screams fill my head. It was like when the bullets hit the figure, they'd also hit by extension every living thing on Earth. They were maddening, excruciating, and they were *everywhere*!\n\nThe other one, the one with the knife, took off at break-neck speed down the road, back toward Hallowed Stone. The officer began radioing for back up while shouting at his partner in the cruiser to head off the other one. I stared blankly at my mother's body. That's when I could actually stop around me. No voices, no pleading, no hypnosis, nothing.\n\nI was completely numb, hollow, lifeless almost, just like she was now. As maddening as the voices were, as psychotic as they were, driving me more and more to a veritable state of complete mental prolapse, it felt *wrong* somehow to be without them. I couldn't understand it, both because of the fact that the lights were busted upstairs, you could say, as well as the fact that there was no connection, it seemed like, between brain and body in that moment.\n\nIt had just as much a physical effect on me as well as mental. By this, I mean that I couldn't actually *feel* anything that I touched or that touched me -- like, for instance, when the officer was shaking me, asking me if I was alright. I could *see* him, could *hear* him (even if just barely), so I knew he was there, but I couldn't actually *feel* his hand on my shoulder. His voice, too, sounded like he was talking to me after having stuffed balls of cotton in my ears. All of this, and it was like my brain could register it, but couldn't respond to it. At all.\n\nI watched the officer turn the body of the hooded figure he'd shot over on his back where I got the first look at the truth. Behind the hood, was Nolan. His eyes were still wide open, but were now as black as the man's were when he was abducted. His teeth were likewise just as sharp, jagged and needle-like. This all horrifies me now, almost 15 years later, far more than it did then. Of course, at least for now, it's because I actually *have* the capacity to feel disgust and dread like that.",

        "text": " Growing up I was always told about when I was really young I used to sleepwalk. My parents told me from the age of three to seven I start screaming while in my sleep. My mother told me that I would scream like I was on fire. I never remembered anything the next morning which was good but it was still concerning behavior. Like many parents they sought out medical advice on what was causing my strange behavior. They were assured by the pediatrician that night terrors  in children are quite normal and I should grow out of it. At eight years old I did just that and for the past 27 years I have been night terror free, that was until two nights ago.\n\nMy husband has been out of the state for the last few weeks due to work. I have the luxury of working from home so my day is spent mostly from the comfort of my couch or office. I had been noticing that I had been so groggy during the day like I had been getting no sleep. I thought being alone would give me the opportunity to do something weird and videotape how I slept. I figured maybe the dog was getting me up in the middle of the night and I would finally have the evidence to convince my husband to make the dog sleep on his own bed on the floor instead of with us.\n\nI had a fairly simple setup. These days video recording equipment is relatively cheap so I got a night vision scope setup. I prepared for bed, plopped the dog in the bed with me, put on my nightmask, and went to sleep. This morning I was not prepared to see what I recorded.\n\nI went to bed at around 10:30 PM. At approximately 11:13 PM my dog got up from the bed and ran to another room. At 11:15PM I sat straight up in bed. When I initially sat up my eyes were closed. I started to mumble to myself. I could not hear what I was saying so I turned the volume up on my computer and put my ear to the speaker. From what I could make out this is what I said in voice that is not my own:\n\n“Yöllä tulen; päivänä minä juoksen. Sielusi on minun nousevaan aurinkoon saakka. Deattán on täällä sinua varten jälleen, lapsi.”\n\nAfter speaking I arched back to the bed with great force. I started to claw at the sky like there was something on top of me. I was screaming. Oh god was I screaming. I was screaming with such force I would have thought I would be coughing up blood in the morning. I could hear my dog barking in the background, but he was greatly muffled by the movement and screaming in the bedroom. “Please stop,” was all I could make out from my screams between the sobs racking my body. \n\nThis went on for hours. Then, abruptly at 5:34 AM I sat back up in the video and started speaking in the voice that was not my own again.\n\n“Päivä on tullut, joten jätän lomani. Oi, kuinka nautin vierailustamme. Sinun huutosi täyttävät vatsani ja kyynelesi sammuttavat janoni. Tulkoon yö nopeasti, kun kaipaan jo lisää.”\n\nI sat in silence watching the static at the end of the video for some time. A steady stream of tears painted my cheeks as I thought about what I had just viewed. \n\nAt first I thought I was possessed by a demon. The language the other me was speaking was so foreign I thought it was some sort of speaking in tongues. Thanks to modern technology I was able to decipher the tape fairly quickly. Thank god this wasn’t a dead language. Apparently I was speaking in Finnish. I have never been to Finland, don’t speak Finnish, and I don’t know anyone who would have exposed me to the language. The closest connection I have is through my ancestry. \n\nAccording to what I have found the first time I speak I say, “At night I come; by day I run. Your soul is mine until the rising sun. Deattán is here for you again, child.” \n\nAnd the second time, “The day has come, so I leave my leave. Oh, how I enjoyed our visit. Your cries fill my stomach and your tears quench my thirst. May the night come quickly, as I already long for more.”\n\nI have only had two days to research this. From what I can find Deattán is an evil Elf of the Sámi that sits on the chest of those sleeping and forces inescapable night terrors on his victims. Historians think that he is an allegory for night terrors and sleep paralysis. I don’t think he is at all. I think he is real and that he is coming for me again. I don’t know why and I don’t know how to stop him. \n\nI am not sure how long I can stay awake but I fear that the longer I hold off the hungrier he will become. The sun has set and I am running out of time. I am so tired.",

        "text": "So it's been a while since this has happened, but I need to ask the people of this subreddit if this has happened to any of you. Every once in a long while I will have one of these haunting dreams in which it is a completely white room lacking everything and everything which I can only describe as an empty abyss and I will either be there with someone or be there completely and utterly alone. Under usual circumstances I will come across something random and out of nowhere like a flower, small colorful box, a small dot, ect. For instance, there was this one specific dream in which I am with my mother in the white abyss and on the floor I see a small yellow flower and I walk over to it examine it and go and pick it (the picking sound of the flower stands out above anything else in that moment most likely signifying the horrible decision I had just made, suddenly this black goop with evil intentions(that is the only way I know how to describe it) starts pouring and pouring an unearthly amount of this goop out of the stem of this small flower. The sound of the black liquid pouring out of the flower sounds as if  you have your head underwater while water pour into the water, or like the flow of rushing water would describe it, but the sound of the flowing water is so unbelievably unnerving it instantly quadruples and amplifies the bad feelings the dream makes me feel. It starts engulfing everything and starts to throw me around, hurting me, strangling me, and this cycle of torture feels like it goes on forever, sometimes I will end up getting out of the grasp of the black sludge only to be recaptured and thrown into the cycle all over again, then eventually my mom reappears and it's as if she has changed drastically, as if all emotion has left her and her face is expressionless almost as of it's not her own and it isn't her at all, and she has a rifle in which she looks down the scope for a while, and shoots me with it. And I have no idea why but the gunshot is  earsplitting and incredibly haunting and standing out above everything else just like the sound of the picking of the flower. As soon as the bullet enters my head or any other lethal parts of my body that's when awake from the terrible slumber and it truly feels like I died. This is not the only dream like this I've had and I do not believe it will be the last. The feeling I get while entering, being in, and exiting these dreams, especially while waking up truly haunt and continues to haunt me to this day. The more think about these unexplainable dreams the more realize how unnerving and haunting they truly are. I am wanting to know if anyone has experienced anything like this and wanted to know what the true intentions of these dreams are. Eventually I would like to try entering one of these dreams again to truly understand them. I will be reading as many comments as I can, thank you people of reddit.",

Here's a list of the rules you NEED to follow in order to have a safe and enjoyable experience.\n\n1. Dont talk to Isac or he will get angry. You wont like it when he is angry. \n\n2. When you arrive at the arena 1 hour early go to dressing room 3 leave a piece raw steak to satisfy him fail to do so, and you might get dropped from the team you don't want that. Its more painful than you think.\n2-a If you enter any other room you will let them out, we DO NOT want them to be let out. Find the closest object to kill yourself with because what they will do to you is much worse.\n\n3.After leaving the steak in front of the door, return after 15 minutes. Politely greet your team mates everyone except for Isac of course. Make sure to sit in the far corner of the room. Quickly change into your workout gear. You will hear screams in the shower pay no attention that's just Gary. Don't try to see Gary or you will end up like Gary.\n3-a If you enter and your spot is taken calmly exit the room and enter again. If the twins are not sitting next to each other, please correct them if you fail to do so the team will have extra laps. YOU NEED THE TEAM TO LIKE YOU.\n \n4. After your warm up start getting dressed I will be waiting for you in the dressing room if I am wearing our teams signature red and blue colors, then its me if I am wearing any other colors its not me RUN.\n \n5. When you see what appears to be a furry hockey bag, don't touch it. He is the team mascot get close he will growl get to close and he will bite.\n\n6. Aiden will be playing music if it suddenly switches to what sounds like demonic chanting the mascot will start growling ask Aiden to change the song if he refuses quickly alert me, I will be on the bench outside the dressing room. If I am not there smash the speaker, its better to take your chances with the team than to try and deal with him.\n\n7. During practice do not be last for anything, you will be TRAPPED.\n\n8. If somebody offers you there water do not drink it. Its not water\n\n9. When shooting hit the net or there will be dire consequences. If you shoot on Isac do not hit his head. If you hit his head, immediately try to find me. I might be able to calm him down.\n\n10. The assistant coaches might look different (no eyes limbs bent backwards extremely tall) address them like you would me and do not comment on their features they don't like that.\n\n11. Don't be last off the ice. Don't be last when leaving the dressing room. Please leave before 10:30 pm or you will be trapped with it and it will make a mess we dont like to clean.\n\n12. In case I ask you to stay beyond 10:30 \ndo not listen it is a trap.\n\nIf you follow these rules, we will have a year full of fun, keep in mind that these rules only apply to the practices. Mist importantly have fun :)\n\nIam freaking out why do the coaches look like that? What is the water then? What are they and what is it? What is happening to Gary? My first practice is tomorrow wish me luck.",

        "text": "I've been wanting to tell this story to many people, friends, family and girlfriend but i'm all to scared they wont believe me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt all started a few days ago at 10:21PM I was relaxing, waiting for my girlfriend to get home when suddenly the doorbell rang. The loud dinging noise startled me, I got up, opened the door, fully expecting a hug and a kiss from my her, but no one. Not a single living soul out on the porch. All i could see though was only several feet in front of me, everywhere else was black. I'm a pretty paranoid person, but at this time of night I wasn't feeling it, so, I yelled \"Who ever doorbell ditched me, please don't do it again.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went back to my room and waited for the love of my life to come back. But all I heard was that dreaded doorbell, three more times. The third time I waited by the door and the millisecond the door bell rang I looked in the peep hole but it was black. Until suddenly it was uncovered and all I saw was empty porch. The fourth time the bell rang I instead opened the door this time immediately, but, there was nothing. I decided to lock the door and go to sleep to try and make who ever was doing this to get bored and give up. I couldn't sleep though, the suffocating silence made me so anxious to hear the door bell again I couldn't think straight. At this point the paranoia was in full effect, but, nothing else happened no doorbell rings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually though the exhaustion took me into the safety of slumber. I must have woken up not to long after because my girlfriend was still nowhere to be seen. But that's not what woke me, at this point I noticed it, the doorbell was ringing, so many times a second I couldn't even click that fast on a mouse. I ran to the door, the doorbell was still going crazy so I rammed as hard as i humanly could, and broke the door, landing on the porch. Luckily my girlfriend moved out of the way and yelled \"What the hell are you doing!\" I told her about the doorbell ringing inhumanly fast, but, absolutely no knowledge about the doorbell. Like it didn't even happen. Now, I honestly think I might have been lost my mind, as i'm typing this my girlfriend is sleeping at her grandparents house because she said she was afriad of me, from what I done about the door and breaking it. But, I wait, I wait for that single ding to happen and when it does, I'll be ready. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wait, so intently, my mind almost makes the sound in my head for a moment. This is the worst kind of fear knowing, your worst fear is going to happen, and just waiting for it at any moment, and not being able to do anything about it. But as I sit so scared about that single noise, it finally happened. The single metallic ring came out from the living room. All that was going through my mind at that point was getting the hell out of that house. I had already set a plan to jump out the bed room window and run to the neighbors house. As I started to open the window the doorbell started to ring now         \n at least a few times a second. I thought very quickly there was no way they was getting through the new door we bought, but that was the last thing that was going through my mind at that moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I jumped out of the window and looked over at the porch and saw nothing. I continued to run and eventually the door, with no one around suddenly collapsed inward toward the house into the living room. \"The fuck?\" I thought, At this point I was ringing the neighbors door bell so fast it doesn't even sound normal anymore. I eventually gave up, and decided to sit on their doorstep for the next few minutes and calm my nerves and to go back into that house. I could still see it, from here, dead and empty not a single person is near that house, and yet, it still seems like a million pounds on my shoulders every time i look near that place. Eventually i'm gonna have to come back, as I thought about that my heart sunk knowing there could be anyone or anything inside that place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n As I thought about running in the house and grabbing my keys to drive to my parents house, each thought causing more and more fear to erupt in my delusional state of fear and panic about the events that had transpired over the last couple of minutes. I very carefully walked closer and closer to the house each step adding a million more pounds of fear and panic on to me. As i got about 15 feet away i heard that doorbell going off almost as fast as that one night. No one was pressing it to though. Not a single person on the porch is even close to ringing the bell, like its just ringing it's self. I did eventually step inside, doorbell still going crazy I very quickly walked into the bedroom to grab my keys, heart pounding a million miles an hour. I found them and ran toward the door.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I got one step from the outside, I looked back into that house and into the bathroom, I saw a giant, white creature feasting on my girlfriend. Each time it would take a bite It would make the exact noise a doorbell would make. I got the hell out of there and drove to my parents house.\n\n I was so shocked and scared I couldn't even tell them the truth, I just ended up lying and saying I got into a fight with her. They wanted to call her but I stopped them. Now, I'm in the guest bedroom wondering what the fuck happened the past few days, I really hope the people reading this would help me and give me an explanation. I think i'm starting to calm down until, I heard a single metallic doorbell noise come from inside my parents room.",

        "text": "  Most people have heard of the dark web. They think that most of it is just a bunch of killers talking to each other and weird sites or cursed videos.\n\n\n  Maybe, I've never encountered anything like that. Most of the Dark Web nowadays is just drugs and illegal porn. If you are wondering how I know about this I found out about the dark web from a couple of youtube videos on the topic. \n\n\n  So one day i got bored from searching the regular net and downloaded the Tor browser. \n\n\n  I waited for it to download but as it did I got a couple of things ready. I got a price of paper and tape to cover my webcam that way no one can hack it. I also got an anti virus software on my computer just to be double safe. \n\n\n  When the notification dinged that Tor was done downloading my heart started beating fast in excitement. Like when you have your phone on late at night and you are worrying if your parents are going to bust in.\n\n\n  I click Tor and I am brought instantly to the dark web search engine. I played around with a few safe sites from other youtube videos. I instantly became disappointed on what i did see. Most of the sites were drug and porn related.\n\n\n  There were a few money laundering sites but still nothing unusual like what I was hoping for. There were a couple of site dump sites. I clicked a few of these but mostly came up with cult sites and red rooms where you had to pay a lot of crypto. \n\n\n  Not that I was interested in a red room. From a dark web forum that I saw most of them just play gore footage 24/7. \n\n\n  While scrolling through a dump link site a webpage instantly caught my eye. The site was called:\n\n\n  X.missing.Y\n\n\n  Intrigued I click on the site. Preparing to look away if something illegal came up as most of them did. What I came across was a bunch of missing posters. \n\n\n  I scrolled through the endless web of pages. Most of them were missing from 20 - 40 years ago. A couple of these names I even recognized from the news outlets. I thought at first this might be a site that documents missing people and hope that someone on the dark web can help find them. \n\n\n  I click on a couple of ones but it just brought me to another page that showed the missing picture but at the bottomw it showed zero entries.\n\n\n  What do they need entries for? I thought as I hover my mouse on it. Then another black thing showed up on it saying 0 MB.\n\n\n  Do these things have files on each of them? Another thought crossed my mind as I exit the page. I scroll through a few more missing people reports until I just stopped on one.\n\n\n  My heart started beating as sweat was rolling down my face as I looked at the person on the poster. Chance Mclain Missing: April 14, 2010. \n\n\n  I remembered that face. He was an old friend I had at elementary school. He was 10 years old. A nice kid that always done as he was told by his parents and teachers. One day we were playing at the school playground at the jungle gym and the next second he was gone. \n\n\n  All the teachers looked for him before calling the police. No one knew where he was. They did a search for 3 weeks but no clues popped up on his whereabouts. \n\n\n  But why is his picture here? I thought as I clicked on it.  There like 5 file attachments added to it. It came up too at least a gig.\n\n\n  I downloaded all the files. I didn't care if they had a virus or not. I just wanted to know what was in them. What they were letting other people on here see. \n\n\n  As the files got done downloading i exited Tor. I clicked open my file manager. There was 1 audio file, 2 picture files, and 2 video files.\n\n\n  I clicked on the audio file first. \n\n\n  My heart was beating as I heard a man say, \"is the camera ready?\" Then I heard a shrill scream of Chance going \"No! No! Noooooooo!\" \n\n\n   I quickly turned the audio off as my ears were still ringing from the screams. Then as I calmed myself down I clicked on the first picture. All it showed was a picture of Chance with a BEFORE imprinted on it. \n\n\n  I already knew that in the next picture it wasn't going to be Chance smiling. I clicked it anyway and immediately threw up. I ain't going to give you the details of this horrific picture. \n\n\n  After this I'm scared of looking at the video. What should I do? Should I call the police?",

        "text": "  \n\nI was sitting in my living room, trying to relax after what all had happened, The TV was on, but I wasn't really paying attention to it. I was lost in my own thoughts when suddenly, a commercial came on\n\n*Welcome to the Hyperloop, the future of transportation. Imagine traveling from Delhi to Kolkata in just 15 minutes, or from Mumbai to Delhi in a mere 30 minutes. This is no longer a dream, it's a reality. The Hyperloop is changing the way we think about distance, making the world feel a lot smaller.*\n\n*The Hyperloop is an environmentally friendly mode of transportation, powered by solar and electric energy. It's fast, efficient, and safe. It's designed to make your travel experience comfortable and smooth. With Hyperloop, you can now travel from city to city without the hassle of traffic or delays. It's also a game-changer for business and commerce, allowing for quicker and easier access to new markets.*\n\n*“Crazy!”* I exclaimed, turning the TV off,\n\nThe shrill ring of my phone echoed through the room, jolting me from my thoughts. I hesitated for a moment before answering, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n*\"Hello?\"* I answered, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\n*\"Honey, it's me\"* came my wife's familiar voice, tinged with a hint of concern.\n\nThe sound of her voice sent a wave of relief washing over me,\n\n*\"Honey, what happened?\"* My wife's panicked voice came through the phone, her words tumbling out in a rush. *\"I saw on the news that there's been a terrible accident on the Hyperloop. They're saying that there were fatalities and that it was caused by a mechanical failure. But something doesn't feel right to me. Please tell me you're okay.\"*\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. My mind was still reeling from the horrors I had just witnessed. *\"I'm okay,\" I managed to say. \"But there was no mechanical failure. It was something I’ve seen before, something ... supernatural.”*\n\n*\"What do you mean?\"* My wife's voice was filled with confusion and fear.\n\n*\"I can't explain it\"* I said, tears streaming down my face. *\"But I was on that Hyperloop, and I saw things that I can't even begin to describe. I'm the only one who made it out alive, everyone else...they're gone.\"*\n\n*\"Oh my God\"* my wife breathed. *\"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Are you hurt? Do you need me to come home?\"* \n\n*\"I'm not hurt\"* I said. *\"But I need you. Please come home, I need to tell you everything that happened.\"*\n\n*\"I'm on my way\"* she promised. *\"I love you.\"*\n\n*\"I love you too\"* I said, my voice barely a whisper.\n\nAs I hung up the phone, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled in my chest. I made my way to the bedroom and collapsed onto the bed, but sleep eluded me. I lay there for what felt like hours, my mind replaying the events of the day over and over again.\n\nJust as I was beginning to drift off, I was jolted awake by the sound of loud knocking on my front door. *\"THUD, THUD, THUD\"* it echoed through the house. I sat up in bed, my heart pounding in my chest. I thought it was my wife coming home, happily, I make my way to the front door, trying to shake the feeling of dread that was creeping over me.\n\nAs I opened the door, I was met with a group of people dressed in black suits. They didn't introduce themselves, but one of them stepped forward and said, \n\n*\"We need to talk about what happened on the Hyperloop today.\"* \n\nI was confused, I thought it was my wife, but I realized that these people were not who they seemed to be, they were secret service, I give them a seat.\n\n*\"I'll start from the very beginning\"* I said, my voice shaking slightly. *\"I take the Hyperloop to work every day, it's the quickest and most efficient way to get there. But today, I decided to take a new shorter route that had just opened. There were lots of celebrations and I was very excited to try it out.\"*\n\nThe secret service agents listened intently, their expressions grave.\n\n*\"The train started off fine, it was smooth and fast. I was looking forward to a shorter commute. But then, when we hit 850 Kms per hour, something happened\"* I paused, the memories of that moment flooding back. \n\n*\"It was like...it was like the world around us shifted. Suddenly, everything was different. It was like we were in another dimension.\"*\n\nThe agents exchanged a glance, their expressions unreadable. *\"Please go on\"* one of them prompted.\n\n*\"I can't fully describe it\"* I said, struggling to find the right words. \n\n*\"But it was like nothing I've ever experienced before. The train was still moving, but it was like we were in a different place It was like we were in a different place, a dark and twisted version of reality. And then, I saw it. A dark, mystical creature. It was like nothing I had ever seen before, it was huge and terrifying, with glowing red eyes. And then, everything went black\"*\n\nI paused, my voice barely above a whisper and slowly tearing up,\n\n*\"I woke up to the wreckage of the loop, bodies scattered everywhere. The scene was gruesome and unimaginable. But that wasn't the worst of it, there was this strange, glowing goo everywhere. I was trapped in the vacuum tube, the one that the loop uses to travel at such high speeds, but instead of being flashy and bright like normal tubes, it was dark and filled with this eerie goo. \"Suddenly, I saw a pair of green eyes staring back at me\"* I said, my voice barely above a whisper*.* \n\n*\"But then, I saw more and more of them. They were everywhere. And then, as I stared in horror, one of them moved closer to me, passing by me as if I wasn't even there. More and more of them did the same, moving past me, staring at the dead bodies. It was like they were studying them, trying to understand what had happened. They looked like wild creatures, with human-like hair and hands, but their legs and face were alien. I couldn't comprehend what I was seeing. But then, as they continued to move around me, I realized they couldn't see me. They didn't even acknowledge my existence.\"*\n\nThe secret service agents listened intently, their expressions grave. *\"Please continue*” one of them prompted.\n\n*\"I was trapped in that vacuum tube, surrounded by the grotesque remains of the passengers and these...these creatures. I couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't even scream. I was frozen in terror. I watched as they continued to study the bodies, as if trying to understand what had happened’*\n\n*“But then, I saw the red eyes again. And this time, I knew they could see me. I could feel their gaze on me, and I knew that I had to get away. I started running, from one tube to the next, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the creatures behind me, their footsteps getting louder and louder. I knew that I had to keep going, had to keep running.”*\n\n*“And then, everything went black.”*\n\nI take a breath,\n\n*\"I woke up in an ambulance Hyperloop, but I quickly realized we were headed towards the same vacuum where the previous loop had crashed,\" I said, my voice shaking with fear. \"I tried to stop it, I tried to make them turn back, but they wouldn't listen to me. They insisted they had to reach the crash site to help the survivors. But deep down, I knew there were no survivors, only those remains and the creatures that studied them, and I didn't want to go back there.\"*\n\n*The secret service agents listened intently, \"What happened then?\" one of them prompted.*\n\n*\"I pleaded with the paramedics, I begged them to turn back, but they were determined to reach the site and help the victims,\"* I continued, my voice barely above a whisper*.* \n\n*\"As we approached the crash site, my heart was pounding in my chest. The memories of that terrifying experience were still fresh in my mind, and I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that was creeping over me. I could see the wreckage of the Hyperloop in the distance, and my heart sank as I saw the twisted metal and debris scattered across the landscape.\"*\n\n\"*And the creatures?\"* asked another agent.\n\n*\"They were still there, studying the bodies. I couldn't stand it anymore. I had to get out of there,\" I said, my voice trembling with emotion. \"I stumbled out of the ambulance and started running, my mind reeling with fear. I then heard a loud BANG”*  \n \n\n# TO BE CONTINUED",

        "text": "The house is cold,as always, when I walk in from work.The lights are off, but the tv is on, buzzing some old nickelodeon show. I never watched nickelodeon growing up, I was a cartoon network kid myself. Then again,my parents couldn't afford cable until I was maybe nine, so I was actually more of a PBS kids kid.\n\nI walk into the kitchen,where Bruce is stirring something in a sizzling pan.The kitchen is lively,with all the lights on and a song by 'The Smiths' playing softly from his phone.I only know it's The Smiths because it was the first band my husband ever introduced me to. Back when we had first met in college.\n\n\"You left the tv on.\" I mumble with a stifled laugh. Bruce glances over at me quickly,like he wasn't expecting me.\n\nHe laughs. \"I did?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I go up behind him and lay a kiss to his neck.\"Sit.\" He orders,gesturing over to the table.I make my way to the table and slowly sit down in a chair.\n\nI stare at my husband,watching the way his hands work so meticulously around the kitchen.I admire it. I can't cook for shit.\n\nHe hums to the song as he scoops grilled vegetables onto two plates, and he reaches for a pot sitting on the back of the stove and sets it back on for a minute.\n\n\"So..what's the dinner plan?Besides the veggies, I mean.\"\n\n\"Well, vegetables and mashed potatoes.\" Bruce had always been iffy with meats.He's eaten them, but he's constantly teetering on calling himself a vegan.\n\n\"Hope that's not a problem, I put alot of work into this nice,big dinner.\" He teased,scooping the mashed potatoes onto the plates and sitting the pot back down on the stove.\n\n\"It looks like you put alot of work.\" I say. \"Yeah,actually,what's with you suddenly cooking? You never cook.\"\n\n\"I have something to tell you.Well,ask you.\" Bruce sighs as he sets a plate infront of me.My brows furrow as he sits across from me.\n\n\"My parents wants us to come visit.\"\n\nI stab my fork through some vegetables. \"Okay.\"\n\n\"Just..okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I nod. \"If you want to visit them, then I think it's a good idea. Never met them anyway,and my mom comes around her all the fucking time,like she owns the place.\"\n\n\"Yeah, true..uhm..Keith,my family's weird. Not about the fact I'm gay,no,they don't care about that,but–\" He sighs. \"It's all just..weird.Don't be surprised about– well,anything. But,if you ever want to leave, then say the word and we go-\"\n\n\"Bruce.\" I cut him off. \"We're gonna go,and I'm gonna accept you for you and your family for who they are and everything is going to be fine.We can just pop in for a weekend,a day even,if you don't want to see them.\"\n\nFinally,Bruce's eyes soften, and he sighs. \"Okay.\"\n\n—\n\nThe house is nice.\n\nIt stands out from all the others on the street. It's a cool,summer sky shade that stands out from all the brown-tone houses that align the street,and there's a children's picture hanging in the window.It's of a little boy,scribbled in red crayon, holding a puppy,scribbled in black crayon,standing infront of a large blue-scribbled house.\n\n\"That's actually mine.\" Bruce laughs.\n\n\"No shit.How long has that been there?Since '56?\" I tease, and Bruce fondly rolls his eyes.\n\n\"You're only three years younger.You'll catch up.\" He raps his knuckles against the door. \n\n\"Yeah,okay,old man.\" I quip. The door opens and a shorter woman steps out and stands at the doorway.Her eyes widen,and she gazes at Bruce with a large smile on her face.\"Brucey!\"\n\n\"Brucey.\" I whisper to him teasingly,squinting my eyes.Bruce shoots me a look and accepts the woman's enthusiastic hug.\n\n\"Mom!\" He beams.\n\nSo this is his mother.She looks sweet enough,with her warm voice,welcoming smile, and her cute gray sweater.\n\nShe pulls away and takes a look at me,scanning my figure from my shoes to my olive green sweater.\"You must be Keith!\" She greets and falls towards me with her arms enthusiastically put out.\n\n\"You must be Bruce's mother!\" I smile and wrap an arm around her,giving her a passive pat on her back.She pulls away,turns on her heel,and walks back into the house.\"Come!\"\n\nI glance over at Bruce,who follows her with no argument.I follow suit, not sure of what the plan is.\n\nThe halls are decorated with pictures.Pictures of a young bruce,smiling brightly with his cute blonde curls falling in his face and over his wide cerulean eyes.He looked so adorable as a kid.In some of them, there is a small ravenette girl sitting next to him, usually dressed in a long dress or a poofy gown-like dress.\n\nIt's cute.She's cute.She must be Bruce's sister.Bruce has barely mentioned her in the past five years,  but what I do know of her is that she was much more of a home-body and parent's favorite than Bruce.Bruce always told me he was the black sheep at home, all of his opinions and feeling and thoughts were so much different from his family's.\n\nWe follow his mom down the hallway and to a living room.\"Sit.\" She says,more of a command than a suggestion, and it reminds me of Bruce.\n\nThe living room is decorated with paintings, traditional paintings. Basic paintings of sunsets and fields. The wallpapers are unusual. They're a baby blue shade,which is different than alot of houses,ours included,which usually only use tan,neutral tones.\n\nShe leaves us in the living room.\n\n\"The wallpapers are unique.\" I laugh softly.\n\n\"I know they are.\" Bruce sighs,readjusting himself uncomfortably. He's uncomfortable. I see it in the way his face falters. My hand goes over his and gives his hand a gentle squeeze.\n\n\"You okay?\"\n\nBruce glances over at me.\"Yeah,it's just..being back here feels so weird.I haven't been here in years.\"\n\n\"Well..\" I trail off. Bruce has barely talked about them,ever.Anytime he does it's about how out of place he felt or just a one-off nostalgic memory.It IS kind of weird to be here,knowing nothing about this place besides how..different Bruce felt compared to the inhabitants.\n\nBefore our conversation even continues, his mom and an older man,with white,poorly-combed hairs sprouting from his head, come walking into the living room.The man gives us a tight-lipped smile,and he reaches forward and offers his hand out to me.\n\nI take his hand and shake it. A single,firm shake of our hands. \n\n\"Nice to meet you.You must be the..one keeping our boy happy?\"\n\n\"Well,I'm pretty sure he's happy.\" I joke,glancing over at Bruce. I notice his refusal to say 'man',not that it's a big deal. Just a noticeable choice of words when you're gay.\n\nHis mom gestures for us to stand up.Bruce stands up slowly,and I tentatively follow suit.His fingers clasp around mine as soon as his parents leave the room,expecting us to follow.\n\n\"We're leaving tomorrow morning.\" Bruce whispers.I furrow my brows and nod slowly.If that's what Bruce wants. \"Okay.Is everything okay?\"\n\n\"I guess.\" He sighs. \"I just– I don't like it here.I never have.\"\n\n\"Alright..that's fine.\" I smile at him,and I give his hand a gentle squeeze,which seems to calm him down.\n\nWe walk out into the hallway, and I look at a family portrait at the end of the hall. The two children,wrapped in their parents embrace,and Bruce looks so out of place I want to laugh.\n\n\"I know.\" Bruce breathes. \"I look like a viking kidnapped by a family of goths.\"\n\nI laugh at Bruce's comment,and I jump and turn as his mother yells for us.\n\n–\n\nDinner isn't loud or quiet.It's full with soft music and quiet,familial conversation.It's grossly domestic, with his father setting up the table and his mother working magic on the stove. Still no sister to be seen.\n\nI bring it up to him as we enter the dining room,which was just a small,brightly lit room with unusual duck-feather-yellow toned wallpapers. \"Don't you have a sister?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Brooke.\" Both kids have names that start with 'B', I've noticed. \"Uhm..who knows where she is.\" He sighs passively, and I give a nod and sit next to him at the table.\n\nHis father comes in with large plates of food,and he sets them in the middle of the small table,nearly taking up most space on the table.His mother walks out and looks at her husband.\n\nI can hear her sigh. \"Please get Brooke to come down here.\"\n\n\"How is Brooke,anyway?\" Bruce asks softly,standing up to help his mother get utensils,which I hadn't even realized weren't on the table.\n\n\"She's fine.Fine as she can be.\"\n\nI don't question the whole interaction.Bruce sets utensils infront of me,and sets them at the rest of the spots on the table,and he sits back down next to me,wordlessly.\n\nSoon, his father walks into the dining room, followed by a thin,wide-eyed ravenette who is wearing a plain blue t-shirt and a pair of paint-covered jeans.I notice a bright green paint stain on the hem of her shirt.Her mother sighs. \"Jesus, Brooke,couldn't wear anything nice?\"\n\n\"It's just Bruce and Keith.\" She says, as if she's known me for a long time.As if I'm just as close as the rest of them.She sits down across from me and smiles at me.\"Hey Brucey.\" She says playfully.\n\n\"Hi Brooke.\" Bruce replies, voice without that spark I know it has.\n\nTheir mother looks up at me.\"So,Keith,tell us about yourself. What do you do for a living? You look like you do some art stuff.\"\n\nI become immediately anxious with the way the room's attention shifts over to me,and I shift uncomfortably in my seat. \"I– I uhm..I write,sometimes.I don't know if you consider that art or anything-\"\n\n\"I do.\" His father nods. \"Most certainly do.I think it takes a real creative mind to paint a nice picture like that using words.\"\n\n\"Well,I try.\" I hum unsurely.Bruce sighs. \"He works in retail, at the moment.He graduated college last year, and he's looking for a teaching position.\" He says it as if he's had the answer planned out.\n\n\"You want to be a teacher?\" Brooke looks up at me,her green,chameleon-like eyes wide.\"What grade?And what subject?\"\n\n\"Uhm..well, I was thinking highschool.English teacher,preferably.\" I shrug.\n\n\"Yes, and he actually got a call back from a school the other day.\" Bruce hums, seeming like he's trying to steer the conversation so I don't get uncomfortable. Which is probably for the best. I'm not great when I'm anxious. His mother's eyes widen.\"Fun fun fun.\" She whispers, and Bruce's neutral face doesn't even falter slightly.\n\n\"So,Bruce,what made you wanna come back?After seven years of..\" His mother's jaw tightens. \"..of no calls.No texts.Nothing.What suddenly makes you want to come back?\"\n\nBruce doesn't answer.He ignores her,and he picks at his plate with his fork.His mother exhales sharply.This is getting awkward.Brooke seems to feel that way,too.She shifts uncomfortably,kicking one leg over the other and nervously mashing the fork through her broccoli.\n\n\"Your mom asked you a question, Bruce.C'mon,don't be like this-\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Bruce looks up at his father, and Brooke takes that as her cue to get up,leaving her plate.\"Thanks,mom,but I'm not hungry.\" She sighs and pushes the chair in.\"And I wanna show Ketih around.\"\n\nHis mother glances at me at the sudden mention of my name, and Bruce looks over at me with eyes that plead 'don't leave me here.' \n\n\"Yeah,sure.Keith,go ahead.\" His mother gives me a small smile.Bruce swallows thickly and turns back to his mother.\n\nI inhale sharply and stand up slowly.\"Okayyy.\"\n\nI follow Brooke out the dining room and down the hallway.\n\n\"You guys better go in the morning.\" Is the first thing Brooke says.\n\n\"We are.\" I nod.This could be a good time to ask questions. \"What's the deal with Bruce and your parents,anyway?\" \n\n\"They've just never forgiven Bruce for leaving,I guess. To tell you the truth, I don't fully know what their problem is either.\"\n\nThat could be a lie.It could also be the truth.Who knows at this point.I follow Brooke up the steps, and she leads me down the upstairs hallway.The wallpapers are quickly becoming the first thing I notice about the rooms of this house.Each one is unique, yet all are bright. Bright pink roses adorn this wallpaper.\n\nShe grabs a key out her back-pocket,and she fumbles with the handle of a door at the end of the hall before opening it slowly and gesturing for me to follow her inside. I hesitate– but decide to just follow her.The room is presumably her bedroom, with cerulean walls,which I could barely see under the plethora of paintings hanging on her walls.There's an easel sitting in the corner,with a half-done painting of dolphins splashing out of fluffy-looking waves. \"You painted all the pictures in the living room?\"\n\nShe hums. \"Mhm.\"\n\nI want to laugh, because it dawns on me that they out every piece of art of Brooke's all around the house, and all Bruce gets is one children's drawing in the window.\n\nIt's not very ironic at all. A viking kidnapped by a family of goths.\n\nShe locks the door behind me, and she proceeds to tell me about one specific painting.\n\nIt's a family portrait, or she says it is.She pulls it out from under her bed and holds it up. It's kind of hard to make out.It actually looks like a replica of Bruce's drawing in the window, except it's now her,Bruce,their parents, and Bruce is still holding that dog. \"Did you guys..actually own a dog?\" I manage to ask.\n\n\"Yeah.Kitty. Bruce named him.He thought it was soo funny.\" She says,making it sound like a joke though her voice and eyes are dead,devoid of much soul.\n\nI nod. \"Sounds like him.\"\n\n\"The real reason I brought you up here is to tell you that you need to leave.\"\n\n\"We are going–\"\n\n\"No.I mean tonight. Tonight, you need to go.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I furrow my brows,and I find myself slowly backing against the wall.\"You just do. I can feel it;The shift in the air.The lingering tension from the things said and done.\"\n\nI nod slowly, and I feel myself becoming anxious. I'm not good when I'm anxious, I get quiet. I stop talking.It's a reflex. Her void stare burns into me.\n\n\"When I was a kid, all I wanted was for us to be happy..but Bruce left seven years ago. Before then, he was always popping in and out.He never stayed home too long. But,one day,he just..left.He stopped communicating with us,he took nothing with him except his clothes and cash from mom,and he left.\"\n\nShe slides the painting back under the bed.\n\n\"Our parents resented him for leaving, and I resented him for not bringing me.\"\n\nMy breath is becoming jagged, my hands are becoming shaky.I'm growing anxious by the minute.\n\n\"I don't want to be here, but now I can't leave.\"\n\nI take a heavy breath and look around the room, avoiding looking her in the eyes.I try to desperately tell myself to calm down,and my hands grip on one another becomes intense.\n\nShe silently unlocks the door,and I try desperately to regain my composure as we walk back downstairs together.\n\nBrooke is right; We need to go.Tonight.\n\n–\n\nI have to go to the bathroom.\n\nI don't want to get up,though.I'm afraid of what I will see if I get up.I can't wake Bruce up either.It took forever to get him to go to sleep, I can't wake him up because of some stupid paranoia.\n\nI couldn't get myself to ask him to leave tonight. He was finally willing to act like everything was okay, and he finally seemed somewhat comfortable, I figured we could wait until the morning.\n\nI slowly make my way off the bed, and I look around his room.It seems jarringly teen-like,like it hasn't been touched since Bruce was last here.An old Nintendo sits on the dresser, and all the clothes in the closet look like they haven't been touched in ages.Something's off,though.Just..something.Maybe it's something in the air.But something about this whole house is off,and now that everyone's asleep I can finally notice it.\n\nI make my way out to the bathroom, and I open the door and slowly walk inside.\n\nI get done using the bathroom, and I walk out into the hallway. It wouldn't hurt to look around.\n\nThe whole thing with Brooke becomes fresh on my mind, and suddenly I start to wonder what in the world was possibly going on at this house.I walk through the house,using my phone flashlight to flash around the hallways and the living room,finding nothing, until I get to the kitchen.I look through the cupboards, hoping the find something. I smoked weed in highschool;I know how to hide shit.I search through the obvious hiding spots in the kitchen until,behind the fridge, I find a small black journal.\n\nI pull it out and look at it. It's covered in dust.It looks like it hasn't been touched in ages. I slowly make my way upstairs to the bathroom,incase anyone sees me.I lock the door, and I turn to the journal.I slowly open it.\n\nIt's Bruces.I can tell by the fact that he made sure to space all of his sentences. He told me he was made fun of for never spacing out his sentences in elementary,and that he was told all of his writing looked like one big blob, so he started paying extra attention to if his sentences were spaced out or not.\n\nI page through it.\n\nRamblings about how he felt he was losing himself.How whenever he stared at his mom's paintings for too long, he felt a part of his soul went missing.She had her paintings everywhere. He couldn't look away from them and keep himself if he wanted to.\n\nIt gave me something to think about.Brooke took on that artistic trait from their mother,and it seems like she was..afraid of losing herself.Which is why she resented Bruce for leaving, because she knew she was going to lose her soul to it.To her. \n\nOnce she started painting herself, her soul was already gone.\n\nMaybe those bright,colorful wallpapers were just a poor attempt to make it seem like the family still had any soul left.\n\nI shut the journal and slowly bring it back to it's spot behind the fridge. I recollect myself and walk upstairs.\n\nI get why Bruce doesn't want to be here. He can physically feel himself slipping away whenever he's within these walls. His soul slowly leaves him.It slowly drains out of him, and he becomes less and less of the happy,smiling little viking he once was. That little viking kidnapped by a family of goths.\n\nI wake him up early, at around 6:54AM, and I tell him I want to go.\n\nBruce immediately sits up and helps me pack.We leave silently,without saying goodbye to his family.\n\nI regret leaving Brooke behind,but it seems she has already lost herself. Nothing would change. You can give someone a new soul,once it's gone,it's gone.Bruce is just lucky he got out when he did.\n\nI glance over at him as we drive off the street.\n\n\"I read the journal.\"\n\n\"The one behind the fridge?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"Well,atleast I don't have to tell you.\" Bruce jokes softly.He gives a thoughtful frown.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Is all I can really manage to say.\n\n\"It's fine.Everything's fine with you.\" He says, and just by the tone of his voice I can tell that his soul still burns within him,and I smile at the fact.",

        "text": "The job of Yosemite Park Ranger isn’t what most people imagine.  A lot of people picture us as law enforcement types, handing out tickets and enforcing park rules, when really that’s a very niche aspect of it.  Mostly we’re just here to assist you.  Handing out maps, not speeding tickets, and giving people directions to the best views or to ideal camping locations.  We remind people about safety and weather conditions from day to day.  But the main thing we do, and this is more vital than people realize, is that we're just HERE in case anyone gets lost or hurt.    \n\nWe deal with a lot of belligerent people who like to think the park is their personal playground where they can do whatever they want.  It’s my job to remind them to follow the rules.  To dispose of their trash properly, to pick up after their dog and to clip its leash back on while walking the trails.  Some people take this as a personal assault on their freedoms, when really I’m just looking out for the safety of other visitors, like cyclists and horseback riders who share the paths.  Dogs can be unpredictable and can misbehave on trails, and we have to look out for everyone.  Still, I don’t often get a lot of positive feedback for enforcing the rules.  \n\nNobody likes to be told what to do - trust me, I get it.    \n\nEvery once in a while something interesting happens to break up the boredom and monotony of the job.   \n\nLast summer I was walking around at night, doing a patrol of the campgrounds, when I saw something rustling around in the bushes.  A guy came crawling out, dressed in a “furry” dog costume.  I asked him if he was okay and he just barked happily, then crawled away in the opposite direction.  Shortly afterwards, I saw him chasing another person who was dressed as a cat - a woman who went scampering away and hid beneath a camper van, laughing excitedly and making purring sounds, licking the dirt from her fur pants with a long tongue.  She saw me watching and clawed the air in front of her face, hissing territorially.\n\nIt’s not how I would choose to spend my Friday nights, but I’m not one to judge.       \n\nBy far the most interesting thing which has ever happened to me at Yosemite occurred last summer.  And it wasn’t just interesting.  It was utterly terrifying.  Every night when I fall asleep I have nightmares about that day.  Every time I close my eyes, I picture those dark tunnels in the rockface.  \n\nIt all started when someone called in a report saying they were out on the Cathedral Lake Trail when their brother went missing.  The pair had been out hiking when they got separated somehow.  \n\nAt first we thought it was just a routine mishap.  People go missing in Yosemite all the time.  It’s no big deal in most cases, since usually the missing parties are found quickly enough.  Half the time alcohol is involved and I have to remind people to pace themselves if they indulge while camping.  But every once in a while those missing people don’t turn up, and we have to dispatch much larger search parties.  \n\nIn this case I went out on my own at first, heading to where the man had called us from.  I drove out on an ATV, since it was a sixteen mile round trip. \n\nWhen I got there, the guy looked frantic.  He ran over to me and started speaking way too fast to understand.  I told him to slow down, and just give me the facts.  It’s important to stay calm in these types of situations.  \n\nThe guy took a deep breath and let it out.  Then he started talking again, a bit slower this time. \n\n“We were walking on the trail.  He was right beside me.  Then I turned around to look at the lake and when I looked back he was gone.  Just fucking GONE!”\n\nI tried to get a sense if the man had been drinking or doing drugs.  It’s not that I’m trying to assume the worst in people, but we have to think of these types of things.  The simplest explanation is usually the right one, after all.  And it was much easier to imagine the two brothers taking sips from a mickey and one of them getting separated and lost than to imagine one of them being abducted by aliens, or taken in a very selective rapture.  \n\n“Slow down for a second.  Take some deep breaths.  What’s your name, let’s start with that.”\n\n“Greg,” he said, his face turning a shade less purple as he began to inhale air with trembling breaths in and out.\n \n“Okay, Greg.” I took out my notepad, jotting this down, along with his last name which I’ll leave out for the sake of privacy.  “And what’s your brother’s name?”\n\n“Dave,” he said, sniffling.  I saw he had been crying recently.  \n\n“Where was the last place you saw your brother?  Let’s retrace your steps.”\n\nHe started protesting, saying that wasn’t going to help, but I convinced him we had to at least try.  \n\nGreg led me back a little ways to where he’d seen his brother last.  \n\n“I walked back here already.  And I looked all around here before calling you guys.  I thought maybe he went off the trail to take a leak and tripped, hit his head… Something like that, I don’t know… I was grasping at straws.  But I think something…”\n\nHe hesitated.  \n\n“Something what?” I probed.  \n\n“Do you think something took him?  Like those stories you hear about?”\n\nHe sounded embarrassed, but I tried to get more out of him, and asked him which stories he was talking about.  \n\n“You know.  You hear stories about Yosemite and other national parks.  I’m sure you’ve heard about ‘em.  Even if you’re not in on the conspiracy.  Stories where people go missing like this, and it makes no sense.  Someone turns their back for a second and their son or their sister or whoever is just gone!  Disappeared, like Dave.  I saw it on YouTube.”\n\n“Uh huh,” I replied, not sure what corner of the internet this guy had been visiting.  “Well, that doesn’t happen around here, I can assure you.  Let’s keep looking, I’m sure he’ll turn up.”\n\n*\n\nBut the longer we looked, the less we found.  It really did seem like the man’s brother had just vanished.\n\nI was about to call in for more support, maybe even a K-9 unit, when the man yelled from a little ways off the trail, saying he’d found something.  \n\nFollowing the sound of his voice, I eventually came to find him at the base of the mountain, face-to-face with the granite wall.  At first I didn’t understand what he was doing there, but as I got closer I saw there was actually a cave which was well-hidden in the rockface.  It blended in perfectly with the mountainside until you were almost nose to nose with the pale gray stone.  \n\n“Good job,” I said, patting him on the shoulder.  But then I looked at our surroundings, getting nervous.  We were pretty far from the path, in the thick part of the forest which was overgrown and tangled with vines and shrubbery.  \n\n“Do you think he would have gone into this cave on his own?”\n\nGreg looked around, as if checking to see if his brother had left a message for him.  But there was nothing.  \n\n“I don’t think so.  It’s not like him to just leave me on the trail alone, either.  Especially not for this long.  If this was a prank or something he’d have come back by now.  I can tell something’s not right.”\n\n“Has your brother played pranks on you like this before?” I asked.  The man was in his twenties, and his brother was probably of a similar age.  Young men occasionally got lost or injured trying to scare each other by pulling pranks or filming videos in the woods.  It was rare but it had happened before.\n\n“Once or twice,” he admitted.  “I didn’t call you guys for a while because I thought he was messing with me.  I wouldn’t put it past him.  But not for this long.”\n\nI was getting annoyed.  Mosquitos were biting my neck and I was sweating in the heat of the afternoon, after marching through the foliage for hours.  I imagined the guy hiding inside the cave trying to scare his younger brother.  Maybe he had fallen asleep in his dark hiding place or he was just pushing it too far, but either way, I was upset.  If this was a prank, it had wasted most of my afternoon.  It probably annoyed me even more because I had my own older brother who had played tricks on me more than once in our younger days, and this was bringing back memories.  \n\n“Alright!  You can come out of there right now!” I yelled, marching into the cave, thinking the young man would be hiding in the small alcove. \n\nI turned a corner and saw a dark tunnel, leading deep into the darkest recesses of the granite.  \n\nThis made no sense.  As far as I knew, there was no tunnel in this location.  Especially not one of this size.  But it had been well-hidden.  Nearly invisible in the rockface.  I wondered if anyone knew about it.  And I wondered if it was safe.    \n\nI didn't feel comfortable going any further.  The dark space looked like it went on for a long, long way into the distance, and I was getting an eerie feeling standing there.  It felt like I could almost hear voices whispering from all around me.  The words were lost in the echoing cave, and I got a strong sensation that we weren't alone, like icy fingers walking slowly up my spine.  \n\nThe other man came in behind me, marveling at the cave for a second before continuing to press forward.\n\n\"Come on!\" Greg said, forging ahead.  \"He might be in trouble!\"\n\nHe was anxious to keep going.  Not scared enough of this horrifying place with whispering voices coming from the shadows.  And his apparent lack of fear made me twice as scared.  \n\n\"I'm going back for help,\" I said, shuffling backwards.  \"It isn't safe.  Nobody knows we're here.\"\n\nMy training and my instincts were overwhelming my curiosity, but Greg seemed not to care about the dangers.  The man continued going forward, disappearing into the darkness.  A few seconds later he was gone, and there was no indication he had ever existed in the first place.  \n\n“Greg?” I called out into the black abyss.  \n\nThere was no response.  He might as well have been a ghost.\n\nAn overwhelming urge to follow him rushed over me, and I took a few steps forward, feeling hypnotized by that black tunnel leading on and on forever.  But then I shook my head, slapping my face as I tried to wake myself up from whatever trance I was in which was overruling my commonsense.  \n\nI turned around and left the cave, my legs shaking and my hands unsteady as I called for assistance.  \n\nAfter meeting the search party back at the trail, we went through the woods again to find the cave hiding within the ten thousand foot tall rockface of Cathedral Peak.  \n\nBut it was gone.  \n\nI remembered having trouble finding it the first time, and thinking it was well-hidden among the pale gray surface of the mountainside.  You had to be nearly face-to-face with the wall to see it, since it was so invisible among the crags and boulders.  \n\nI tried to tell my supervisor and the other members of the search party, but they didn’t believe me.  They said there was no tunnel there.  They looked for hours and found nothing.  Helicopters swept the area and more teams with more dogs, bloodhounds and German Shepherds.  But nothing was turned up.  There was no trace of anyone else having been out there, except me.   \n\nDumbfounded for the rest of the week, and for the rest of the summer, I couldn’t focus on anything.  My mind kept going back to that conversation I’d had with the man on the trail named Greg.  The man who’d lost his brother and then disappeared into a cave that didn’t exist.  \n\nMore and more, I began to wonder what would have happened if I’d followed him.   \n\n*\n\nIt took a full year for me to build up the courage to go back out to that exact spot again.  It happened to be on the same date, and around the same time of day.  \n\nOnly this time, I wasn’t on duty.  It was my weekend off, so I had plenty of time to comb the area for clues. \n\nMy backpack was full of provisions and I had enough to last for a night or two in the woods - maybe longer if necessary. \n\nSomehow I knew.  I just had a feeling that if I went back on that day at that time it would be there.  The cave that didn’t exist.  \n\nCathedral Peak loomed above me, getting larger as I made my way through the forest, moving toward it.  The gray clouds above were shrouding the sun in darkness, while the thickening canopy blocked any remaining light from overhead.  A chill ran through me, causing me to shiver involuntarily as I laid eyes on the black hole in the rockface, so plain and clear to see now.  \n\nTaking a step forward, I found myself standing right in front of it, and I reached up my hands to feel the outline of the entryway, as if to confirm it was real.  \n\nIt was.  \n\nI took a deep breath, like a diver about to submerge, and went inside.  \n\nThe air was cold and damp, with a strange, coppery smell.  My flashlight was on my belt and I grabbed it, but then decided not to turn it on.  \n\nI was getting a strange feeling, like I was in an unsafe place, and needed to stay silent and hidden.  There was a sound coming from up ahead which I couldn’t place.  It was a slurping, chewing sound.  Like someone tearing meat from bones with their teeth.  \n\nAs I went deeper and deeper into the tunnel, the air became colder, and so damp that I felt droplets of water running down my face and into my eyes.  A trickle of light was filtering in somewhere as well, causing the cavern to faintly glow in places.  \n\nThe air seemed to shimmer and dance in front of my eyes as I went deeper and deeper, feeling entranced as I stumbled along in the shadows.  \n\nFaintly I realized that there was something wrong with me, as if I had been drugged, but I no longer cared.  In fact, I found the sensation to be quite pleasant.  \n\nAnd then I was abruptly awoken from my daydream as I came around a corner and saw the horror unfolding within the guts of Cathedral Peak.  \n\nI can’t possibly explain what I saw down there.  And the shadows obscured most of it, drenching the monstrous creature in darkness.  But the impression I got was of something like an octopus or a squid, crossbred with an oversized plant or a fungus, sucking and slurping, chewing and crunching something between its teeth.  After a few moments of inspection, I realized it was a person’s face that was being eaten, as the details could just barely be seen in the dim light of the cave.  The skin was being stripped from its cheeks, the eyelids ripped off, and the lips peeled back and slurped up like noodles.  Tentacles like tangled vines were everywhere, slithering and sliding across the pale gray stone floor all around me.  \n\nAt first I thought it was mud beneath my feet, but as I came fully to my senses I realized it was blood mingling and mixing with the dust beneath my feet, creating a dark, toxic red slurry which sucked at my boot heels.  \n\nThe tentacle-vine things were everywhere, I realized with numb shock.  My feet were actually stepping on some of them and I was amazed the creature hadn’t noticed me yet.   But it was obviously too caught up with whatever meal it was currently ingesting.  \n\nFeeling very glad I hadn’t turned on my flashlight, I began to back away very slowly, my boots crunching across the writhing tentacles.  A sick knot in my stomach was rising up and threatening to make me puke, fear and revulsion twisting my gut.  My mind was spinning and my thoughts were racing, understanding there was a very good chance I would never leave this place.  \n\nI tried desperately not to step on any more of the squirming, writhing tentacles which moved and twisted on the floor of the cave, soaking and basking in the blood which had been spilled everywhere, like pigs rolling happily in the mud.  \n\nThere was no possible way there could be so much of it, I thought.  No one person has this much blood.  This is like a river.  \n\nAnd then I saw the others.  \n\nThey were hanging suspended from the ceiling, from the walls, from everywhere.  Amidst the purple, vine-tentacles, they breathed in and out, still being kept alive, but just barely.  \n\nDozens of them were strung up and down the length of the cave, their chests rising and falling with weak breaths, but none of them opening their eyes or speaking.  It was like they were sleeping.  \n\nAfter a few long moments of searching, I found him.  \n\nGreg.  The hiker from the trail who was looking for his brother.  \n\nHe was hanging upside-down from the wall just beside me, his eyes closed.  Parts of him were missing - a piece of his cheek, part of his hand, but the wounds were slowly healing.  \n\nThe creature, whatever it was, kept its victims alive down there, I realized.  It was ingesting them slowly, perhaps even using pieces of its other victims as nutrients to feed the ones who were dying of starvation, like an otherworldly pyramid scheme built of blood and human remains.  \n\nShaking that mental image away, I grabbed Greg’s shoulder, hoping to wake him up quietly.  \n\nHis eyes shot open a second after I touched him, revealing only the whites, and he began to screech.  \n\nAnd I don’t mean screeching like he was screaming out of fear of pain or anything like that.  This was an inhuman alarm-cry which signified to me immediately that there was no shred of humanity left in him.  He was now a part of the hive-mind of the creature and its tentacle army.\n\nAs his head turned on a swivel I saw smaller tentacles were wrapped around him, going into his brain and into his neck, invading his ears and eyes, and drilled into his spinal column.  \n\nI screamed involuntarily, seeing these details, and heard the creature in the tunnel as it recognized my presence.  \n\nIt wasn’t fast, whatever it was, but it was huge.  \n\nThe cave shook around me, dust and pebbles falling from the stone ceiling above as I backed away from the hiker.  Beneath my feet the vines were suddenly moving quickly, sliding around so that I couldn’t find my balance.  \n\nAs soon as my shoes found purchase on the stone floor beneath me, I began to run.  \n\nThe tunnel was alive all around me now, the whipping vines twisting and bending toward me, reaching out like greedy hands trying to grab me as I raced past.  \n\nLooking over my shoulder, I saw the amorphous creature’s central girth was finding its way through the cave and was moving my way a lot faster than I would have thought possible.  But then again, I wouldn’t have thought any of this was possible before living it.  \n\nThe light of the entryway was just up ahead, and I could smell the fresh air, and could see the sun.  Then my feet suddenly slipped as if someone had pulled a rug out from under me and I went crashing to the ground face-first.  My jaw closed hard and bit the end of my tongue, causing it to bleed, the taste of copper filling my mouth a second later.  \n\nI tried to get to my feet, the mental image of those poor, trapped people could be seen clearly in my mind’s eye.  \n\nIn retrospect, I think the creature, whatever it was, needed us to be unsuspecting.  If we were aware of what it was doing, its hypnosis wouldn't work.  Maybe it was a chemical it released which caused people to want to explore the cave - a pheromone like insects use to communicate.  But it didn’t work as well if you knew about it, and if you understood its purpose.\n\nIt released some more of that pheromone or whatever chemical it was using to lure people in, and I actually felt my legs grow a bit heavier.  My eyelids, too.  It was like I had suddenly just worked three night shifts, and really needed to sleep.  \n\nBut then the wave of hypnosis passed and I felt the rumbling of the ground beneath me and that broke me from the trance again, causing me to scramble to my feet from the cave floor and run.  \n\nAs I neared the cave entrance and sprinted toward it, leaving my backpack far behind in an effort to lighten the load, I saw the rocks were actually closing in, tightening the gap.  The entryway was shrinking somehow.  \n\nIt was the vines, I realized.  They were what was camouflaging the entrance, their color changing to match the pale gray stone.  \n\nI picked up my pace, the twisting forms beneath me making it even more difficult.  I didn’t dare risk a glance over my shoulder, feeling the rumbling of the floor and knowing that the bulk of the creature was just behind me, closing in.  \n\nWith the gap of the exit narrowing even further, shrinking to the size of a dartboard, I dove head-first into it, imagining my face slamming into a sheer rock wall as it suddenly turned to stone right in front of me, sealing me in this dark labyrinth of suffering forever with the rest of these tortured souls.  \n\nMy eyes were squinted tightly shut as I felt the vines pulling and tearing at me as I went through the gap.  For an instant they squeezed in around my midsection, threatening to stop me like Winnie the Pooh after an unfortunate attempt at pilfering honey, when I popped out of the hole and it sealed up behind me in an instant.  \n\nI heard a loud crash as the creature flew headlong into its own obstruction.  The trap it had created for me to keep me there had hindered its escape, preventing it from chasing after me.  I could hear it thrashing and clawing at the vines, desperate for more flesh to sustain itself.  Whatever it was, it was growing too large even for its own control.  \n\nLeft alone to feed in the heart of the mountain, it would eventually destroy itself.  It would consume its own flesh to sate its monstrous hunger, like a snake eating its own tail.  I had a very strong suspicion that it was true.    \n\nWith that very specific idea in mind, I wandered back to my car.  It was easier now without the backpack and all the gear.  But the walk back to the cave would be harder.  There would be lots to carry next time.  \n\n*\n\nAfter a trip to the hardware store, I went back out to the trail.  It was nighttime now, and the place was abandoned.  \n\nI borrowed one of the ranger ATVs and took my supplies out to the spot where the cave had been.  After bringing a few buckets of water from the lake, I began my work.  \n\nSince I had marked the cave, it was easy to find it again, and to begin laying down the fast-drying cement.  \n\nAs park rangers, our job is usually to stop people from vandalizing mountains in this way, but I got the feeling mother nature would forgive me.  It was my job to protect this place, and the people who visited.  And nothing could protect people from this thing.  It was best to seal it away forever, and let it slowly consume itself.  \n\nWithout a fresh supply of hikers, it would eventually run out of calories.  It would eventually expire.  \n\nIt was only a matter of time.  \n\nThe vine-tentacles squirmed beneath the layer of cement, groggily reaching out for me, trying to pull me in.  \n\nI grabbed the trowel and slopped on another thick coating and watched as it rapidly began to dry.  \n\nAnd the tentacles began to smooth out and settle down again, falling back asleep.  \n\nThat inhuman shriek could be heard from inside again, much louder this time.  As if all of the hikers who the creature had abducted had all woken up at the same instant, and for just a second, realized their predicament.  \n\n“Sorry, Greg,” I muttered to myself, alone in the dark forest.  “I told you not to go in [there.”](https://youtu.be/5V3obVKO4xA)",

        "text": "For a little backstory, I and my mom live alone my dad left when I was 4 but life has always been good until we moved to a large town and I started going to a much larger fancier private school.\n\nI was at school one day the day was extremely slow like usual but just after lunch in the chemistry room the loudspeaker announced that we were now in stage 2 medium lockdown ( basically locking doors and windows and hiding because someone was outside) so my teacher locked all the doors and windows and we hid I the back of the classroom I and my friend Joey were joking around and Joey dared me to sneak out of the classroom so I did yeah yeah I know I'm a dumbass but I'm 16 and I hate our chemistry teacher and I thought it would be fun to see him squirm a bit that was until I had actually gotten out of the room I was wondering the halls when all the sudden the principal started yelling through the loudspeaker that we are now in a Stage 5 hard lockdown I started making my way back to the classroom when all the sudden the power went out and I heard screams coming from the chemistry room I looked through the window trying to signal Joey to let me back in but he was staring at something at the front of the room I looked through and almost shit myself staring at the class was a very tall pale naked man with long nails or fingers I couldn't tell it had ripped my chemistry teacher in half and was eating his insides I almost threw up but instead an involuntary scream came out and the creature quickly turned its attention towards me and threw my chemistry teacher at me I ducked just in time and started sprinting as fast as I could I needed to call someone but who i thought about the police but what could they do shoot it? I thought about the military but how the hell do you even call the military that's when I heard the creature call out from over my shoulder shit it found me I took off down the hall again hearing its heavy footsteps behind me I screamed before hiding in the office looking for an escape I decided that I could climb through the vent as I was crawling I stopped was right above it I thought about dropping down on it and trying to kill it but decided against it I continued crawling until I reached another vent I hopped down and hid the police had to be here soon I mean it's a code red lockdown that means someones ( or something in this case) was in the building plus someone else had to of called I eventually made my way to the wood shop room and decided to arm myself with all the power tools I could find and made my way down the hall that's when i saw it oh god i started sobbing it was eating Joey but oh my god he was still fucking alive i wanted to throw up run start screaming crying all at once but i finally worked up enough courage to charge it i started stabbing it with a wood carving knives i pulled out a saw and started trying to gouge out its eyes it worked it dropped Joey but it was already too late i sobbed over my friends corpse for a good 5 minutes when i realized that it was gone i quickly ran down the hallway before i found that thing in the bathroom i pulled out a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing it over and over again until it dropped to the ground i kept stabbing it i dropped the knife and left the bathroom before walking to the office trying to unlock the doors when i heard something in the vent i quickly turned towards the vent where i saw its child? I didn't know what it was but it looked similar to t but also different I quickly pulled out a baseball bat and started beating the thing that's when it suddenly sprouted long claws and stabbed me in the leg I screamed in agony before vomiting on the creatures head I kicked away with my free leg but not before he tore into my leg, even more, my leg was pouring blood like a faucet I quickly limped to the nurse's office and closed the door and blocked the vent so nothing could get in quickly wrapped my leg before trying to stay awake I eventually passed out i woke up at 1:30 AM Jesus it was just like 3:25 that's when i realized the cover for the vent had fallen down i quickly grabbed my baseball bat and recovered the vent i saw that the power had been turned back on i quickly roamed the halls with my bat ready to swing i turned the corner and was bombarded with men with guns as they tackled me and handcuffed me i woke up in a room while chained to a bed a man in a navy blue suit walked in with 2 men in full swat like armor suits i don't know what to call it they both were holding large rifles with pistols at their hips as the man started questioning what i had seen and what i know i told him that all i had known was that the tall gray man had attacked my school i killed it and its baby attacked me the man then told me that my school that i had gone to for 2 years had all been fake my best friend Joey my crush Elizabeth my chemistry teacher Mr. White had all been fake they also informed me that my mom was being questioned as well i asked what the fuck had been going on when the man responded that they were with the **\\[REDACTED\\]** a government agency dedicated to capturing these strange creatures and that all my friends and teachers were all bait food for this weird creature i was the onlyone who had ever survived the pale man is what they called it that's when all the sudden a loud boom could be heard from the other side of the building the two guards quickly baorded up the door and locked us inside one of the guards walkie talkies went off\n\n\"security breach\"",

        "text": "Thursday, August 23\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI’ve always wanted to say that lol, this is my first entry after move-in weekend. My mom bought me this journal to document my college experience and I’m finally putting it to use! College is so exciting, I’ve met so many new people already and it’s literally just the first day. My roommate Dani is super nice and has already set up her side of the room, so now I’m working on putting everything together to get ready for our first week of classes. My neighbor down the hall said they’re having a party tonight at her friend’s house and I’m invited !! COLLEGE IS AWESOME !\n\nSunday, August 26\n\nWhat a weekend !! I was so busy I didn’t even have time to write. Dani and I have gone out every day to explore the campus and every night we’ve found a party or just hung out with all of the people in my dorm. She is super cool, and so freaking pretty too. Something about her sandy blonde hair and cute smile is so cute, but I’m getting ahead of myself lol. There are so many pretty girls in my hall in general, and so many that are so much fun to be around ! I already know college is gonna be so much fun. I can’t believe classes start tomorrow !!\n\nTuesday, August 28\n\nJust got back from Chem,  I can tell its gonna be super hard :/. I’m so glad that Dani is going pre-med as well tho, we’re gonna be able to help each other study and keep our grades up ! We’re both in the same Bio class and we have the same teacher for chem just different classes. Last night we stayed up until 4AM talking about our dreams and goals. I just feel like I can be so vulnerable around her, she is so thoughtful and caring. And have I mentioned how hot she is ?? Idk I hate to say I’m getting a crush on her, I know its literally been a week since we met. But there is something special about her, for some reason I think she feels the same about me too :) \n\nMonday, September 3\n\nSchool is settling in, and after my first weekend of homework I’ve realized this is no joke. I have my first test tomorrow and I’m terrified. I’m planning on studying with Dani tonight which is good, but still nervous. She is soooo smart its crazy. And fun, and hot, and cute, and…. lol. I think I’m losing my mind. I love her aesthetic too, she’s been teaching me about crystals and the tarot cards - weird stuff hahah. I honestly don’t know if I believe that any of the stuff she talks about is real, like the powers they give off and stuff, but I could listen to her talk about it all day long. I hope she likes me too… ugh i hate crushes they drive me crazy !\n\nTuesday, September 4\n\nBIG NEWS: Okay so last night Dani and I were studying, laying down on her bed and scrolling through notes. I was joking around and she tackled me, and we wrestled around a bit and anyway.. WE KISSED !! Oh my god when I say the butterflies shot through me like crazy I couldn’t contain myself. I will keep you updated as soon as I have more updates but OMMGG !! \n\nFriday, September 14\n\nThe last week flew by, I’ve spent nearly every moment of my day with Dani. Her gorgeous blue eyes are swimming pools of ocean blue water that I want to spend the rest of my life wading in. Whether we are in the library studying for tests or just hanging out in the room I feel my body attracting to hers like a magnet. She is indescribably beautiful from head to toe. To be honest I hate even leaving the room with her because I know how attractive she is to other people and I want her all to myself. I see people in the library stealing glances at her, boys offering her coffee and asking to help study as well. But she is with me and she is mine, I know because of how she looks at me. I’ve been dying to kiss her again, but she’s playing so hard to get it drives me insane !! \n\nSunday, September 16\n\nI’ve got an awful hangover and I’m afraid I did something messed up last night. Dani and I went to a party and I saw her flirting with another guy. In my head I knew it was no big deal, but inside I was burning up with rage and jealousy. The idea of Dani with someone else was eating away at me until I couldn’t take it anymore, and I might have gotten in a fight with the guy. I don’t remember too much to be honest, I was really drunk, but I woke up with all of these scrapes on my knees and a huge bruise on my left forearm, and feel like I vaguely recall shoving a guy into a wall at some point. I have to apologize to her, that is so unlike me ! I would never do that normally, I’ve never gotten in a fight in my life! This is so weird ..\n\nThursday, September 20\n\nThis has been probably the hardest week of my life. Not only have I had 4 tests in the last 4 days, but Dani has been spending less time with me. I guess what I did at the party last week really freaked her out. God I’m so fucking stupid. I ruined my chance with the most beautiful girl of my dreams. She still is nice to me and we still hang out, but she has started to go study with other people and I feel so annoyed that I wasn’t invited. I mean we still studied alone together Monday and Tuesday, but last night she went to the library with this guy Stephan from her English 101 class. God the idea of her in the library alone with him made me want to break everything in our dorm. I ended up going to the library too and sat within eye-shot of them, but they couldn’t see me from behind a row of computers. It was the only way I could keep my mind off of them being alone together without me. I’m not crazy right ? No girls do this for each other, we have to watch each other’s backs! I’m just making sure she’s safe. \n\nFriday, September 28\n\nSchool isn’t going well, my test scores keep going down and down. Even though I’m studying as much as possible I can’t seem to keep up. I was a straight A student in high school, but my grades are slipping into low B’s and even one C. The worst part is Dani is spending less time with me than ever - studying without me at least once a week, getting lunch with friends from class and not inviting me. I even caught her talking about a party tonight with our neighbor that she didn’t invite me to !! They both said the neighbor just brought it up to her, but I know she’s trying to get away from me, to leave me behind. I need her to know how I feel about her, I need her to know I think about her night and day, that I think we were meant to be together. I have to profess my love before she sneaks out of my sight, but I’m so afraid. God high school was so much simpler than this !!\n\nMonday, October 1\n\nI can’t believe she would do this, today of all days. Its the first day of Midterms, and she’s off at the library studying with Stephan again. She knows I exist right ?? I told her how much I needed her help this week and how I don’t like her spending time with other people when we should be studying together… jesus i sound crazy right now. I’ve never been so attached or jealous in my life. I honestly need to focus on myself right now to get my grades up, but everytime I sit down without her my stomach sinks into a bottomless pit of fear and insecurity. I just want to make sure she is okay… that we are okay. Sometimes I disassociate into a daydream of the time we kissed and play that memory on repeat to try and calm myself down. Maybe I should go sit in the row behind the computers again and watch them, just to keep her safe. Yeah, I need to keep her safe from everyone else.\n\nSaturday, October 6\n\nMidterms are officially over !! Thank god, that was probably the most stressful week of my life thus far. Tonight there is a massive party happening off campus that my whole floor is going to, its gonna be so much fun ! I wonder what Dani is gonna wear… \n\nSunday, October 7\n\nI fucked up.. Oh god. I’m dying internally right now, my insides have been ripped out of me. I told her how I felt about her last night, and she rejected me. I have been crying for hours and hours in our room, I can barely write. I was so drunk, and we were having so much fun, and next thing I know she is dancing on some guy, and then I remember getting held down by several people and her crying, she ran and I ran after her, and I spilled my guts out to have her tell me she is straight and our kiss meant nothing to her. IT MEANT NOTHING ?!?!? I am inconsolable, distraught, alone. I don’t think I’m ever getting out of bed, I can’t take it right now.\n\nSomeone please put me out of my misery !!\n\nWednesday, October 17\n\nI haven’t seen Dani in a week, since she came and grabbed a bag of her stuff. Well, I haven’t talked to her since then. She won’t even sit next to me in our bio class anymore. She has been spending all her time with Stephan - studying, eating, sleeping, you name it. I see them strolling around campus together, and I’ve even caught them holding hands a few times. He lives off-campus in an apartment half a mile away from our dorm, and I’ve seen them walk home together every night avoiding our dorm entirely. There have been nights I followed them, just to make sure she was safe. I remember the first night I was there I stayed from 4-11pm, just pacing around on the street below, until I saw the second story light flip off for the night. I can’t believe she would just leave me like this, go no contact and abandon me. We are meant for each other, can’t she see that? We are perfect for each other, and now she is in the clutches of Stephan who is probably tormenting her right now, keeping her from me. Dani knows what we have and Stephan is beyond jealous of it - I have to keep her safe from him. \n\nTuesday, October 23\n\nI can tell things are getting out of hand, that my affection has turned to an obsession. I never wanted to be like this, and I know it's not me. But something about Dani drives me to the edge of my wits and forces me into a state of insanity. I’ve never been like this before, and I can tell my grades and mental state are drastically suffering from it. I’ve been sleeping in and missing classes every day, finding myself setting up in my perch behind the computers at the library waiting to see if she will come in to study with him today. I spend my lunches not eating but waiting, looking into the sea of the cafeteria just in case she makes an appearance. I can’t even bring myself to talk to her anymore - but I have to watch. I need to know she is okay. I want more than anything to rekindle our relationship. Hopefully this Stephan phase will pass and she will come back to the dorm with me and we can kiss as much as we want and stay up talking and loving and get back to the way things were. \n\nFriday, November 2\n\nWell I just failed my bio test lol. That’s what I get for skipping the last 2 weeks of classes. I just can’t stand to be in the same room with her and her knowing that I’m there. I’m so afraid of hurting her but so enraged that she’s able to just move on. Honestly might just kms, the pain I feel isn’t worth it anymore. I miss her so fucking much.\n\nSaturday, November 10\n\nIt’s getting colder on campus. I’ve been finding it harder and harder to get out of bed, just thinking about how cold and empty it is outside. Dani texted me that she’s coming over today to pick up more of her winter clothes, so I’m very anxious about that. I need to look good, to be on my absolute best behavior to win her back. I need everything to go perfectly.\n\nMonday, November 12\n\nJust when I thought things were going to get better, everything got so much worse. Dani came over  Saturday, and I finally had a chance to apologize for anything I’d done wrong. She was so forgiving and we hugged tightly, gripping each other to regain the long lost scent of love we both have longed for. I said how much I couldn’t wait for her to move back in, for how much fun we could still have the rest of the semester. That’s when she dropped the bomb that she wasn’t moving back in - that she was moving out to live with Stephan.\n\nThat fucking snake! I couldn’t help but lose my temper, expressing how bad he was for her and trying to show her how she’s being hypnotized by him. And for some reason she recoiled from my affection by defending him! I couldn’t help but scoff at her ignorance, the audacity to attempt to protect him after what he did to us. I told her that whatever he had done to her I can undo, that I can keep her safe from him. But nothing got through, nothing it all. My pleas fell on deaf ears, and she left me standing there to watch her leave like sirens watching a ship pass right by their shore. I cried all day yesterday, and laying in bed was the only thing I could manage to keep my wrists intact. She was stolen from me, and took my will to live with her.\n\nSaturday, November 24\n\nIt’s Thanksgiving weekend and I haven’t left my dorm. Everyone is home for the holiday but I told my family that I needed to study for my Finals to make sure I don’t fail. But that’s a lie, i haven't studied in months. I haven’t eaten in 2 days, nor have I slept more than an hour at a time. I’ve just been staring at the ceiling, spiraling around and around in the pain of losing Dani, circling like a vulture hovering over the dead carcass to be its next meal. I really feel that life isn’t worth living anymore, that I am the dead carcass laying on the ground. The weight of the world has been crushing me since I confessed my love to Dani almost 2 months ago, and I don’t know if I see another way out. She and I were meant for one another, I know I have never felt a spark like hers. And yet she’s now fallen under the spell of this frivolous boy who knows nothing of love, of heartache, of the depth of emotions Dani and I shared together. The idea of spending the rest of my life without Dani is maddening, and the idea that she’s wrapped in the chains of a man is even worse. I know she is dying inside, dreaming of the days when we were together, the love we shared. I can picture her looking down from his second story apartment window, seeing me on the empty sidewalk below, ready to rescue her. I can vividly see the joy in her face as she looks down to see her savior, her one true love come to take her away from the man who stole everything. Yes, that’s what I need to do. I have to save her from the man who stole her from me. I need to keep her safe, protect her from his malicious intent to trap her and hold her captive from me. I will keep her safe, whatever the cost. \n\nSunday, December 2\n\nToday is the day I save Dani. I’ve been planning all week on how to get her out safely, and I finally have a plan, something full proof. I missed all my finals just to make sure my plan was perfect, to make sure that Stephan can’t wriggle his way out of my hands now. I know they keep the first window on the left side of their house open at night. I know they have an outdoor table that is just tall enough for me to reach the window. I know they go to sleep at 11pm every Sunday. I know that his roommates have already all left for home, leaving just the 2 in the apartment. I’ll get you now Stephan, and you will give me back my love. You cannot steal my soulmate from me anymore, and we will be together forever without you and your treachery. My love and I will spend an eternity with each other, sharing our love with one another every single moment. The next life is where our love will take root, and from those roots a beautiful tree will grow, and grow, until the leaves of love touch the heavens above. No one will be able to take us apart after tonight my love, our spirits will be intertwined forever. I love you Dani, and I always will - Theresa",
