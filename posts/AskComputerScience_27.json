Wouldn't the team of lawyers at Microsoft be able to shut these companies down, especially the for-profit ones?",

        "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to post this, as I need advice regarding CS studies as well as life in general, but it stems from CS.\n\nSo, my situation is that as surprising as it may seem, I am in my last year of Bc. degree that is mostly computer science, however I have not been able to learn to read nor write the formal mathematical language that is used everywhere in CS (at least at my uni). To me it's just a bunch of letters and symbols and I constantly fail to see what they are supposed to express. During my studies, I've had a couple of subjects that heavily used the notation and I've managed to pass them, though usually on the edge of failing. However, I am getting really desperate, because most of the study materials we get are written in the formal definitions and even the simplest things that I can deduce on my own confuse the shit out of me when written formally.\n\nNow my problem is that I don't feel that I learned that much at the university, as I constantly struggled with trying to decipher even the simplest things. I don't think that the majority of the curriculum would be too difficult if it was explained in a more digestible way - once I got someone to decipher it, I could digest it without any major difficulties, but I felt bad to constantly bother my classmates. Also, the degree I study is apparently more focused on the theory, rather than programming or some practical use of it and I have next to no practical experience, so I'm not really ready to find any CS-related job at the moment. I planned to go on and study masters in CS, but I'm really concerned that I won't be able to keep it up without being able to understand the formal crap. I also considered going to a different university for bachelors again, so that I learn it all properly (and choose something where I would get more practice), but I'm really afraid that it is going to be a bunch of incomprehensible symbols all over again.\n\nSo, does any of you know, whether there is a CS university degree in Europe that would be more digestible, source of digestible uni-level materials, or a way I could go on with CS while avoiding formal definitions? (learning to digest the definitions is also a way, but I've been trying to do so for pretty long, without success)\n\nI'm getting more and more desperate as I don't really know what else I could study and do later in life, but I'm really struggling with even the basic stuff when it's written in this non-verbous way.\n\nThanks for any help, advice, opinions, anything!",

I want to know if I should get something like a nice Windows laptop (Dell XPS series, Razer Blade, etc) or a MacBook. I am planning on asking for a laptop from my parents as a graduation gift from high school, so that they would buy me a nice one. Anyways, I recently just got an iPhone X because I was sick of Android's unoptimized ecosystem and instantly fell in love with the Apple ecosystem. Part of me now wants to buy a MacBook for college partially for the ecosystem and partially because of a similar feeling of optimization after moving away from Windows. Being able to natively use XCode would also be nice to work on iOS dev. My whole life I have used Windows machines like the desktop I built, but have always been at least a little intrigued of switching over or at least using a MacBook along side a more powerful Windows desktop.\n\n\nMy main questions about using a Mac with Computer Science are: \n\n-Is the software support good enough where I will be able to do most of the things I can do on Windows? \n\n-How difficult will learning MacOS be? I'm very used to Windows 10 right now.\n\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this!",

This way the strengths of the transmissions could be stored with a timestamp at regular intervals, and then read and interpreted by a computer at the end of the game\n\nThe only other feasible method, that I could think of, would be to have cameras on the roof and two walls, which interpret the video to get (X,Y) coordinates of the ball in each frame. These could then be merged together to get (X,Y,Z) coordinates at any particular time.\n\nAll my other ideas can be shot down immediately because of problems like the player getting in the way of the transmission.\n\nDoes anybody here have any ideas on how this could be done?

        "text": "So i’m a linguistics major, full on liberal-arts dork and i’m interested in pursuing neurolinguistics and psycholinguistics so i’m double majoring in Brain and cognitive sciences. This is an interdisciplinary program that allows me to take courses in biology, psychology, chemistry, engineering and computer sciences which i think will be a good path for me to go to grad school for neuroscience. \nI’m not really interested in machine learning, but I do know that for big data analysis, learning R and Python will be helpful for me. Right now i dont have time to teach myself a programming language on top of my course load and 3 part time jobs, though. And i'm completely lost on where to start with that too\n\nSo i’m enrolled in this mandatory algorithms course. I have no CS background, i’m shit at math (and i graduated high school 10 years ago, so whatever i did learn is rusty, and the only maths i’ve seemed to do well in recently is oddly logic and lambda calculus for semantics....when i didnt even pass algebra back in the day)\n\nWe’re using the Cormen textbook. But i legitimately feel completely stupid in this course. All of my notes are mindless scribbles that i copy from the board and make no sense to me, i dont know what n log n is or what all the variables mean, i dont understand the code or pseudocode or how to do anything at all! My professor said we dont need to know a computer language to do well in this class, and all the CS majors rave about how great this professor is but i cant understand why. He told me i could email him any time with questions but i am so far gone lost that I dont even know what questions to ask! And that last question  I did ask him he never replied to me until after i turned in my midterm....\nI can understand the conceptual stuff. If you asked me the difference between a the different types of sorting algorithms i could explain how they are different and what their steps are, but it's more like i’m describing how cakes are made, and not the chemical processes that help create a cake out of a blob of batter. \nI can't get a classmate to help me because no one in my class knows me since i’m an outsider and they all ignore me....and because my prior lecture is on the opposite side of campus i always end up having to grab whatever seat remains in the back because i am late and so i cant even try get chummy with someone i could sit near often or anything like that. \nI feel so so stupid, and helpless. I failed the midterm because i couldnt answer a single question and turned the whole thing in blank and left the room crying. Now everytime i go to class i choke back tears because i feel like i’m listening to instructions on how to stay alive in the apocalypse all in a different language and because i can't understand my end is imminent.\n\nI need to have a high gpa for a scholarship or i’m going to have to drop out of school and go back to my home country too so i feel a lot of pressure to excel in this class as well as ace all my others, which are challenging.\nI tried khan academy since it was written by the same author as my textbook but it wasnt much help for me except in understanding the conceptual stuff, since i dont know coding i couldn't do the challenges.\nI’m losing my mind.\nAlso i’m a kinesthetic learner so i’m struggling with surviving uni enough as it is and while some strategies i’ve used for studying other subjects are helpful they dont apply to maths or sciences courses very well and i feel even more stupid and useless. \n\nAny advice on what to do so i can ace my final and bring my grade up???

In addition, I decided to take Macroeconomics as an elective after thoroughly enjoying taking it in my senior year of high school (just a regular high-school elective, no AP or anything), and I've continued to enjoy it quite a bit. \n\nPrior to about two weeks ago, I planned on switching my major to a combined degree (different from a double-major, a single degree with an integrated plan of study taking the most important course requirements/electives from each major) in CS and Business Administration, as I was interested in how I could apply a CS background to the more \"business-y\" side of the tech industry. I took plenty of business courses in high school and competed (and earned several awards) in various business-oriented competitions at a school and district level. \n\nNot too long ago, however, the college emailed me informing me of a new CS + Economics combined major. This really piqued my interest as I really enjoy both subjects and could see myself truly liking this combination. \n\nI was wondering if anyone here had similar experience and/or would be able to give any insight as to the possible applications in the industry for such a combined skillset. While I am certain I would enjoy the coursework (even though I'm sure difficult times are ahead, although I'm certain the same could be said for a pure CS degree), I was curious as to what type of a future I could be looking at with these two disciplines. \n\nAny insight/advice/general comments would be greatly appreciated.",

I've been thinking a lot about why this is and I've come to a few observations:\n\n**1.** In programming (a large part of computer science education and application), I have a lot of anxiety about testing and debugging, I hate the thought of spending so much time constructing this structure only to have to spend time basically trying to break it, and then only so that I can spend even more time trying to figure out what's going on beneath all the seemingly obscure and arbitrary syntax and trying to figure out why the computer isn't happy with what I wrote. **Do any of you have any advice about how to deal with such anxiety?** \n\n**2.** This is related to another personal weakness that I observe: computer programming involves the creation of an actual \"thing\". It has to work and be ready to be used by anyone-- it's not sufficient for it to be \"almost there\", it must be perfect and user-ready. I am not used to such object creation. I've always been, for better or for worse, a very \"academic\" personality. I can write you an essay, read and analyze some texts, perform well on some tests, memorize some facts, etc. but I've hardly ever been good at creating *things*. This is something I dislike about myself, and studying computer science has put me face to face with this weakness-- **any advice on how to deal with it?** \n\n**3.** Computer science doesn't generate any real passion in me. I don't mind it (and I like the aesthetics of it sometimes), but often I don't want to do the work because it feels like such a drag. I think the reason for this is that I'm most interested in things that feel \"fundamental\" or non-arbitrary. Math, physics, and philosophy are examples of things I would consider fundamental/non-arbitrary. Computer science is like a specific application of math and logic for a specific machine, but there's nothing else to be said of it, or at least this is how I feel about it sometimes. **What made you love computer science and do you ever feel like computer science is arbitrary and mainly a mere applied subject rather than something fundamental in its own right?**\n\nOne of the most enjoyable things that I got out of my computer science related education was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33vbFFFn04k&amp;t=56s) video on how semiconductors work. The fact that the properties of something like a diode can be coherently and fully explained by the fundamental chemical properties of its materials made the experience of watching the video thoroughly satisfying. If only data structures made me feel this way.\n\n**4.** I'm really only in it for the jobs-- I feel like it's my duty to take advantage of my opportunities to get a job that makes money and use that money to help people that I couldn't otherwise help if I were just some \"starving artist\". One of the problems I have with dropping computer science is that it's one of the few majors, to my knowledge, that can land you a well-paying job only with a bachelors. **Do you think that this is a solid enough reason to stay in computer science? Could a math major be just as good in this respect, and would you think that I have it in me to be successful in math if I'm not successful in computer science?**\n\n\nI just feel too embarrassed to drop the class, but I don't know if I have the \"stuff\" to be a competent computer science student. I would appreciate it if any of you have any advice about how to solve the issues that I have (I want to be good at computer science, and I don't want to drop out of it) or recommendation for me about dropping/continuing with computer science.

        "text": "The best way to describe this would be with n-categories. A glider would be a 1-category/1-glider and glider gun would be a 2-category/2-glider and a pattern that produces glider guns would be a 3-glider. You could generalize this to an n-glider/n-category. Now the way you would analyze this problem would be to look for invariants as you increase n. Anyone have any idea as to how to find those invariants? It would be nice to generalize this to other patterns as well but for many patterns not even a 2-category version has been found.",
