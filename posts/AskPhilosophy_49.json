This argument doesn't sit right with me, I'm not sure why one can't be virtuous in one aspect even if it makes them an overall more \"vicious\" person. Take the example of a courageous terrorist, a courageous terrorist may be more capable than a cowardly one, but I would still say that he possess the virtue of courage. It seems nonsensical that someone could possess the same trait that would both me simultaneously a virtue and a vice. If one could \"reform\" a terrorist, one wouldn't want to get ride of his courageous virtue.",

In order to be able to consent to a social contract, one has to have the option to be able to agree to it without be coerced. The person would have the option to either consent to the authority of their state (and be locked in a sanatorium), or to leave their state. However, in today's world all territories that allow for human subsistence are the property of states. If they left their country, they would have to live the territory of another country. Other countries might not allow them to become citizens (due to their citizenship laws), or might share laws that force left-handed people in sanatoriums. Wouldn't this situation be a situation where there are people to which no state is able to have legitimate authority?\n\nAnother example that is much more likely would be one like this. Someone wants to do something, but no countries a person can become a citizen of allow them to do it. For example, the person is in an interracial relationship and is unable to marry their partner in any country, they want to have an abortion but it's forbidden everywhere, or they smoke weed and the consumption of weed is forbidden in all countries they can become a citizen of. Since the entirety of the Earth's resources that are necessary for human survival are taken up by states, the person would be unable to consent to the social contract of any country, as they would be coerced into giving up their liberty in other to survive. Therefore, no countries would have legitimate authority over them. What is it that stops this from being true in today's world?",

From my understanding, one of the strongest theist comebacks to the problem of evil is the free will defense coupled with the idea that God allows evil to both enable free will and because he's working towards some greater good down the track. Add to this that our human cognitive abilities are much much less than God's so we are very unlikely to know what that greater good is and when it will occur.\n\nNow if one person uses their free will to attack another person (or something worse) and I am in a position to intervene to prevent or stop that attack, should I use my free will to intervene? If God isn't going to intervene we would have to assume that this evil act will produce a greater good at a later time. It seems then that my intervention is likely to prevent this greater good from happening.\n\nI don't think it's the case that God is presenting me with the chance to do good by using my free will to intervene, because then we are denying the perpetrator's ability to use their free will in instigating the attack. It also seems that we are sacrificing the victim and perpetrator in this situation for my opportunity to intervene. There are also many, many acts of evil that occur when no one is in a position to intervene. I think this situation applies equally to natural evils as it does to man made evils.\n\nJust as a side note, I don't condone inaction or evil acts, personally I think we should help other people when we can, and just be a bit nicer in general.",

Mill talks about it in chapter 5 of his book, Utilitarianism. Do you think he is successful in responding to the objection of retaliation and vengeance? Let's use an assumption that Mill does not say that our desires are always to maximize OVERALL happiness but just desires for happiness.

        "text": "Running into a bit of a problem here reading Locke: it's bananas confusing.  \n\n\nIn E2.II.xxi.15 Locke wants to make a distinction between preferring and willing (volition): \n\n&gt;\" preferring, which seems perhaps best to express the act of volition, does it not precisely. For though a man would prefer flying to walking, yet who can say he ever wills it? Volition, it is plain, is an act of the mind knowingly exerting that dominion it takes itself to have over any part of the man ...\"\n\nbut then seemingly goes on to make a direct equivalence between the two:\n\n&gt; LIBERTY, on the other side, is the power a MAN has to do or forbear doing any particular action according as its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in the mind; which is the same thing as to say, according as he himself wills it.  \n\nSo I understand that this distinction is a later addition to the text but it does seem that this change now vests a lot of power in the phrase \"takes itself to have\", which the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy seems to construe as a \"belief\". Whose belief? To take the language of Locke it would seem only the belief of the one willing, which does seem to undermine the ability of this definition of liberty to say anything concrete as we might have different beliefs.\n\nIs it Locke's position that the man walking is not in a state of forced \"not flying\", and with regards to flying is not at liberty? This seems to contradict II.xxi.10 where regardless of volition, the man is not at liberty to leave the room because he lacks the power to act on the theoretical willing.   \n\n\nMaybe I am just deeply confused; at times Locke seems to take what should be simple and make it monstrously confusing.",

The probability of that seems too low. This must have been rigged.\n\nPerson B, let's call him the skeptic, says: \"There is no need for surprise. 500,000 lotteries have been played. Sooner or later someone had to win two lotteries, even if it was back to back.\"\n\nWho is correct here? Many would say person B is correct but why? Each lottery is independent. The fact that 500,000 lotteries were played before has no influence on the probability of the lottery wins **today** and **yesterday**.\n\nLet's now shift the scenario a bit. Let's assume no lotteries have ever been played before yesterday. The first day the first ever lottery is played yesterday, Jane wins. The second day it's played, today, Jane wins again. It seems, intuitively, that the chances of the lottery being rigged is now much higher here. And yet, the probability of Jane winning today and yesterday is clearly the **same** regardless of how many lotteries were played before.\n\nOne might say that the reason why this intuition occurs is because a person/agent/etc is more likely to rig the first two lotteries out of two ever played than at the 501st and 502nd lottery and not anywhere else. But how can we make this assumption? Let's assume for argument's sake though that a rigger is just as likely to rig the first two lotteries than say the 501st and 502nd.

So that made me wonder, what is the relationship between socialism (a rejection of liberalism and its new form neoliberalism) and post-modernism?\n\nPost-modernism, as far as I understand it, tends to reject grand historical narratives like historical materialism (of marx) or even the old Whig theory of history. I feel obliged to say this just because of how often this topic comes up: not asking about Jordan Peterson. Historical materialism is integral to marxist and neo-marxist philosophy and as post modernism rejects it, \"post-modern neo-marxist\" is nonsensical.\n\nNo instead I want to examine the actual relationship between socialism and post-modernism. Marxists necessarily reject it right? Does this extend to non-marxist thinkers like Kroptokin or Proudhon? Post-modernism tends to see history from an individual's pov right? And so that fits somewhat well with New left style thinking on gender, class and race right? Or am i misunderstanding post-modernism?\n\nWhat is the relationship between post-modernism and socialism?",

        "author": "IXBlackHeartXI36",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/z5mq4e/is_cancel_culture_moralism/",
        "text": "Personally, I've been getting tired of cancel culture. It seems like I can't buy anything without feeling guilty for giving money to unlikable people. This lead to me re-thinking it. Today, a thought occurred to me: cancel culture bears a lot of resemblance to what I've read about moralism.\n\nA common criticism of cancel culture is that its overly draconian, particularly in that everyone gets the same 'punishment' regardless of the severity of their offense. In particular, people are getting canceled for saying or being involved in things decades ago, regardless of their current opinions. \n\nTo me, this comes across like moralism. In moralism, even minor transgressions are believed to inevitably lead to worse and worse offenses. A good demonstration of this is the picture at the top of the Wikipedia article on the topic. It shows how a sharing a drink with friends will (supposedly) inevitably lead to one's moral downfall and death. To me, this resembles the seeming view point of cancel culture, at least in part. If you believed something insensitive in the past (such as racism), there's no redemption for you, and you surely must've done horrible things since that time. Of course, this isn't a new problem; people who try to turn away from white supremacy often find that everybody will treat them as if they never tried. This causes practical problems in making it so nobody will interact with them. This often tragically leads to them returning to the white supremacist movement, just so they can continue to function. You see the same phenomenon in the flat earth movement. People who try to leave it often find they're forever labeled an idiot and there's nothing they can do to convince anyone otherwise, forcing them to return to that sub-culture just so people will hire them again. \n\nThat latter part isn't necessarily moralist; nobody's claiming that believing the earth is flat makes you an evil person, you're just a hopeless idiot forever more. Of course, even then you can argue that people do often see stupidity as a moral wrong. If you make a claim in science that later gets refuted, your credentials are taken away because being wrong even once is unforgivable. Smart people also have a tendency to act like people dumber than them should have no right to make their own decisions. Point is, it can be argued that people see being incompetent as wrong, even if they wouldn't necessarily think of it that way.\n\nBack on point, do these similarities mean that cancel culture is a form of moralism, albeit one that can be applied to just about everyone rather than to specific demographics such as white supremacists and people who drink?",

        "text": "  \n\nAccording to Alfred North Whitehead, William James’s consideration of non-dual consciousness as prime reality inaugurated “a new stage in philosophy” by “denying exactly what Descartes asserts.” James introduced the term “sciousness” for this nonduality— consciousness without consciousness of self—in his *Principles of Psychology*, and emphatically reasserted its possible primacy in the conclusion of his revised *Briefer Edition* 2 years later. \n\nHis later works on radical empiricism revived the concept but not the term. Theodore Fournoy (James’s friend and Jung’s mentor) and John Dewey were among the few who emphasized the term itself as key to James’s most essential contribution to philosophy. My book on James with SUNY Press also emphasizes the term, as does a book I edited entitled *Sciousness*. But here I would like to share an excerpt on sciousness from a picture-filled Talk I gave for the New York Open Center on “The Prime Reality of Second Sight.” \n\nJames kept a very open mind toward psychical research his entire career, and, in the last year of his life, suggested that second sight might be “a veridical revelation of reality.” Sciousness thus proved an essential concept for James: viable as a fundamental principle of both personal and transpersonal psychology.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhiVdtqVyeg&amp;t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhiVdtqVyeg&amp;t=11s)",

        "text": "Slight wall of text ahead but trust me it’s readable in like 2 minutes.\n\nAt 18 years old I took 16 months off education, spent a lot of it thinking and questioning life rather than living it after being in an existential state for months. I unintentionally gained a much more critical perspective of the world and life; what I had known to be true and what my existence really was. Although this seemed like a gift, it lead to an aspect sadness but at least I understood things now. Well, for the most part. \n\nAnyways, At 19 I went back into education, University to be specific, and that also was influenced. I realised a greater importance to studying, or more so *learning*, and started to look forward to it in contrast to previously finding it more of a chore. Especially particular subjects, my interest increased in history and humanitarian subjects which I previously thought was frankly a waste of time to study. I also sat a foundation year (which I’m currently in) to get used to education again and perhaps see other fields of study.\n\nHowever, beside Mathematics there still wasn’t anything I was incredibly interested in. Until, I discovered what Philosophy was about. \n\nI never learnt about Philosophy, it wasn’t a subject at GCSE (age 16) or A-levels (age 18) at the schools I went to. In fact, when I heard about it when I was younger I thought it was about fossils. I guess my brain somehow shifted the ‘il’ part in front of the ‘os’ so it turned into phosilophy, but since I never ran into it before it didn’t seen something I’d have any interest in. \n\nThere’s a whole story how I ‘discovered’ philosophy, but to simply put when I realised what it was about, something clicked like I had finally found what I was looking for. Philosophy is, exactly the subject I had been looking for my entire life. The reason I loved maths was because of logic, applicability and is completely abstract.  I saw that in philosophy and more.\n\nThe more I looked into philosophy the more I fell in love with it. Or at least, the concept of it. However It felt as if I just found the ‘thing’ I’ve been meaning to study my whole life. \n\n‘Great! Well, study it at university!’\n\nWell it’s a bit more complicated than that.\n\nTurns out my university doesn’t do Philosophy, and especially Maths and Philosophy as a joint bachelors degree which would’ve been perfect. Only universities about 4-8 hours away. \n\nI’m currently living with my parents as cost of living crisis (context: UK) makes it’s incredibly expensive to live on my own. So staying with my parents I’m saving a shit ton of money and greatly financially benefitting future me. Additionally, the uni I’m going to at the moment has pretty good prospects and rep for Mathematics, and is ranked high in the UK.\n\nSo I have two options.\n\n• Live at home and save a lot of money. Go to University but only do Mathematics, not Philosophy. I don’t need to worry much about barely making it every month since I won’t be renting, and I can continue my current lifestyle which I’m pretty Happy with.\n\nOR\n\n• Move out of my parents house, blow most my savings on rent and such, go to University and study Maths AND Philosophy (insert ‘yaaay!’ Sound effect) at a Uni / course which isn’t as highly rated as my current maths course,  I’ll be slightly more independent by learning to live on my own (I’m still quite independent living at home), I’ll have less time to focus on some personal things outside of study. Additionally, I’ll have to reapply to University which will fuck over my student fees (there’s a new student loan law applying in 2023 applicants) and generally slap future me in the face financially. This is all JUST to study Philosophy.\n\nSo I was thinking, could I just do the first option, study only Maths as my degree and just learn about philosophy as a ‘hobby’? I won’t be able to go much in depth, especially as I’ll be self teaching it, and overall it’s just been a tough decision so I thought I’ll hop on Reddit and ask a bunch of ‘philosophers’ what they think.\n\nThanks for reading this, any advice is helpful.",

The thing I don't get is what is the essential engine of said change.  Sometimes what I read seems to say that things change because of their interconnection with everything else, and that through this constant interacting things change each other and become new things, that the interaction results in quantity changes which result in quality changes.  But other times they say that it's the inherent contradiction within things, that things change because of the inherent tensions within them.  But if it is the second, where do the other things come in?  If things change because of their inner contradictions, why does their connection with other things matter?  Couldn't you just have a world where everything is atomized, but changes because of the inner contradictions?\n\nI would just like somebody to explain how the two go together or where my thinking is wrong.

        "text": "Hello!\n\nThis may be more of a personal question than a general one. I have stumbled upon a dilemma (don't want to call it a problem yet) and that is reading, more specifically, books. I find it hard to enjoy reading philosophy books. Since I was 12-13 I took an interest in both philosophy and psychology, in order to understand myself and the world around me, and I was never a \"good\" reader, but rather turned to blogs, articles, video essays and discussions. I barely ever read an entire book, and when I did, I viewed it as a \"waste of time\" as I understood the \"idea\" or \"message\" of the book in the first half of the book.\n\nSo what is the dilemma, really? I can't find any \"reason\" in reading an entire book once I have the idea, but on the other hand, I'm also aware that this is putting me in a risky situation in the near future once discussions take place. I.e. I can't see why I would \"need\" to study different cultures among different groups of people, when I can read upon \"culture\" itself, as a concept/model/phenomena, call it whatever. This way I'm in no need of details such as colors of dress, hat or no hat and so on. I have, however, studied the different branches (not all, of course, but enough), had my fair share of dialogues among the years, and they went pretty well. But as I now want to have my own lectures/talks, I feel obligated to read these book. I just haven't found a good enough of a motive to do so.\n\nNOTE: These are not story-based books but rather philosophical (in majority).\n\nNOTE2: \"Understanding\" doesn't necessarily mean to grasp the entire idea, but being prepared if the subject is brought up.",

        "text": "Richard Campbell in his work “The Metaphysics of Emergence”  states the following:\n\n&gt; With the rejection of Aristotelian ‘substances’, something analogous to prime matter is all that was left for substance to be. For Locke, substance was an ‘unknown somewhat’, whose only role was to ‘support’ observable properties. But George Berkeley soon recognized that such indeterminate ‘**matter**’ was simply a superfluous **leftover** from an **abandoned metaphysics**. Recall that “material” was introduced by Aristotle as the correlate of “form”, and was always the material of some entity, such that the ‘material’ of some entity is contrasted with its ‘form’; they are correlative concepts. But **that correlation has been abandoned** by anyone in the modern era who talks about the ‘matter’ in the universe. Without substantial forms as its correlate, the traditional concept of ‘matter’ also loses its sense. We do not have to accept Berkeley’s subjective idealism in order to recognize that he was right about that – **despite the fact that people to this day uncritically continue to use the word**.  pp. 46-47\n\nSo, after reading that passage, I had some questions in mind\n\n* If it is the case that the word “matter” is a “superfluous leftover” from an old and abandoned metaphysics that, however, is still being used uncritically in modern science, should its use be abandoned?\n* If so, what should replace it?",

        "text": "I was recently reading about attempts to create chickens without sensory organs, so that theoretically meat in the future will be something akin to a fruit rather than an animal that can suffer. \n\nI started thinking about the ethical implications of this development, whether it would be positive for reducing suffering or negative for creating a sort of monster that goes against a respect for life and animal welfare. \n\nBut this led me to think more broadly about the situation, and to realize that whatever my ethical conclusion is on the matter, there is basically nothing I can do to prevent this from happening. Even if I came to the conclusion that it was deeply wrong and should be stopped, what can an individual person actually do about something like technological development? At best, I could start a nonprofit that raises money and talks about the viewpoint I want to push. But even then, the “chicken fruit” issue is too nuanced and complicated that I don’t think any clearcut solution would arise in the same way as say, slavery being unethical and deemed illegal. \n\nAnd so my question is: can you recommend me any ethicists which factor in the lack of power most agents have - and thus the lack of power that the agent actually has. Most ethical discussions I’ve read seem to just argue in the abstract as to whether something is ethical or not, and don’t factor in real world limitations and realistic solutions.",

        "text": "Hi all. I recently earned a degree in a field that did not require much in the way of rigorous, analytical writing. I have taken a couple upper-division philosophy courses, but they were, I imagine, unique in not requiring any take-home papers. I intend on applying to master's programs in philosophy this June, but having not written anything during undergrad that I can use for a writing sample, I have been trying to develop a prompt and a syllabus for myself that can get me writing. However, since I've started (a few months ago now), I've found myself in the same cycle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Inspiration/idea\n2. Research possible readings (combing through PhilPapers, SEP, public class syllabi)\n3. Read and calibrate (after any one reading, I tend to realize that my original idea was too ambitious for my current skill level; or too simple/basic/shallow for a writing sample; or I'll decide that I also need to read x, y, z, and the rest of the alphabet before I can really know what I'm talking about).\n4. Existential dread\n5. Recover from emotional damage, jump back to 1 or 2\n\nMy primary issue of course is that I just don't really know what I'm doing. Add to that being frequently busy with work, and having an obstructively perfectionistic temperament, so that I find myself equally invested in and overwhelmed by this project. I really do love philosophy and there's a lot to this process that I find deeply enjoyable, but when it gets to \"I should write my paper on \\*this\\*, \"this\" winds up breaking down for some reason or another. How should I narrow my topic down while also doing all this alone? Thank you in advance, I'm happy to provide examples or clarification if needed.",

The easy example here is nazism, but I personally believe it extends to many conservative (social) ideas. Restrictions imposed on otherwise innocent people that seek to harm or limit their freedom because of the way they were born. With no benefit to anyone whatsoever.\n\nAnd it seems like these ideas are tolerated and even platformed in social media, not because they offer anything of value to the conversation or because they secretly hold an untold truth, but rather because they're already here. The main idea is that since there are two sides, we should hear both of them out equally.\n\nThey're already a part of the conversation, and in an effort to not invalidate or silence \"a side\", public discussions continue to harbor textbook examples of ideologies that are either completely illogical, dangerous, or both.\n\nI also want to clarify that I'm not calling for the government or big associations to forcibly dismantle these examples, since that is getting into politics that are far more complicated than I'm ready to discuss.\n\nMy question is about whether we, as people, philosophically, ought to give these ideas the time of day simply because they exist. \nIf, on a given topic, one side has already been proven to be correct and the other to not only be wrong, but dangerous and preying on vulnerable people to spread itself, what worth is this latter \"side\" to any sort of intellectual discussion?",

In this sense, the parts comprise truly one being, as this principle that unites the parts is intrinsic to the organism.\n\nHowever, a machine is not a one being as much as a heap of sand is not a one being, as its goal, function is imparted from the outside. Its principle of unity is extrinsic, its unity is in the perceiver's mind, not in-itself.\n\nTherefore, we can say that a machine is only a metaphor, something that resembles life but not quite. Machine or a system is built to mimic life. \n\nIf this is the case, isn't defining life by something that mimics life problematic?",
