I got cold feet and realized mental health wasn’t directly for me. I began working in schools with children with disabilities &amp; really became interested in school psychology because although it’s not mental health therapy i thought I could still focus on SEL. Working in the schools and observing Turns out the ways schools are functioning the priority is high testing and assessment &amp; if lucky maybe you would work on SEL. thus I got anxious and didn’t pursue the program. I thought maybe teaching but while working with teachers the profession is basically a sinking ship with no support. I enjoy working with children and families, small groups, literacy, phonics &amp; children with disabilities. I am now looking into SLP. But regardless I feel like a failure I know my inconsistency after COVID was bad &amp; I am angry at myself for being confused and inconsistent. I don’t want to be like that anymore.

But I’m completely lost in how I can find course-based masters programs bc I don’t have a ton of research experience and I’m not doing an honours degree. I’ve tried to look, and maybe I’m blind, but a lot of these programs are thesis based.  \n\nIs there a different name for course-based masters around Canada, or around the world for that matter?\n\nI’m also wondering if every thesis-based Masters is supposed to progress into a PhD? Or that you can do a thesis-based and stop there and start looking for jobs? \n\nI know my questions sound really dumb, but i just need a lot of help because I’m the first one in my family to pursue a graduate degree so I’m alone in this. I would really appreciate any help about the different kinds of programs for psychology in Canada that are course-based (if there’s some sort of a list that separates course-based and thesis). I’m scrambling now bc i’m near the end of my degree and don’t know if I’m doing anything right to increase my chances of getting into grad school if i want a job in psychology.

I completed all of the graduation requirements, with the exception of finishing and defending my thesis. Which if I am being honest with myself, has a long way to go. \n\nI feel bad about the whole thing, but the truth is I am kind of relieved. I have been struggling with depression and general anxiety since I was a teenager, and my anxiety was made worse from writing my thesis. I was in therapy for two years, which is how I was able to even complete my thesis proposal in the first place. I later found out that a professor on my thesis committee told my coworker that my manuscript wasn't very good and should have been much more polished, especially given that I submitted it a year late than what the program rules stipulate. Needless to say, that was very discouraging. \n\nThe obvious answer to the question is yes, I should finish the thesis. I feel like I have to finish it because it's the right thing to do, and I don't want to disappoint/upset my advisor, who has become a dear friend, and who I have worked with for over four years. But I can't get myself to care about it anymore, and I'm not sure if it's worth it to finish it. I already got the job (not the one I wanted but good enough), and there is no difference in pay between a BS and MS in my industry. I think I've already made up my mind about it but i keep coming back to it. \n\nthanks for reading. Any constructive input is appreciated.",

I write up stuff like talk notes in LaTeX, while notes for meetings with my advisor or reading group meetings are usually just text files (not really worth the trouble of formatting a whole TeX document). I've found that this last method is a bit lacking, however. My folder \"Meetings with &lt;advisorname&gt;\" has 30 text files in it, each labelled with the date; and I've started another folder for notes I take *during* the meeting (the others are for notes I take in advance). Many of these overlap with each other because we don't get to every topic at most meetings, and overall the whole thing is rather annoying and inconvenient.\n\nThus, I'm curious if anyone knows any note-organizing programs that would make this easier. I currently use Zotero for reference management and Notion for personal and research to-do lists (although I haven't delved too deep into the Notion rabbit hole), but I'm looking for something more tailored to notetaking. Ideally, this program would include the following features:\n\n* The ability to create multiple \"projects\" (advisor meetings, reading group 1, reading group 2, etc.)\n* \"Pre-meeting\" and \"during meeting\" notes for each meeting\n* Some kind of LaTeX integration (though that might be a lot to ask)\n* The ability to create an internal organizational structure for each meeting's notes, e.g. a section on administrative stuff and a section on research stuff, the second having a subsection on equivariant homotopy and another on derived arithmetic geometry\n* Some tools for messing around with said internal structure; for example, the ability to copy a section to the next week while keeping it linked in some way to the original (so as to maintain continuity while avoiding redundancy)\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions! (And feel free to share your relevant thoughts/experiences/similar questions in the comments even if you don't know of a tool like this.)\n\n(p.s. I've looked a little bit into emacs, but I couldn't figure out where to start or even what it really is. So if you think it's the best solution, I would really appreciate a bit of guidance there.)",

Regarding letters of recommendation -- Who do I ask for them? I have not been in school for 6 years, so is it still normal to go back to old professors or HS teachers? I wasn't really a student who stood out... Would work references count? I have pretty good work references (science teacher and lab work) in fields relevant to the Masters I want (Molecular/cell/microb iology)\n2. My GPA is only 2.8. I've seen on here that its more than possible to get in with this GPA. Will my work experience help?\n3. Is it possible to take some of the credits required for the masters as a non-degree seeking student to help bump up my GPA and then apply for the program I want? Is this less risky for me since my GPA is not that good?\n\nPart of the reason I've put off grad school is because I am insecure about my past performance in school.

The first referee will be my prof whose lab I have worked in for two years, the latter in which I completed an undergraduate thesis under the prof's direct supervision (her supervision of my thesis research will be what the reference letter will focus on).\n\nI am not sure however if the second academic reference that I have in mind \"counts\". I started in the aforementioned lab as a full-time research assistant on a PhD student's project (at this time I worked entirely under the PhD student and did not work too closely with the prof/lab supervisor who would go on to supervise my undergraduate thesis project). This PhD student, while still in the midst of completing their PhD, recently became a Faculty Lecturer at the same university. He knows me very well and would be able to attest to my experience working on a research project with him for several months. I am however unsure if he counts as an academic reference given that he is not a full-time professor, and was not a Faculty Lecturer at the time that I performed research under him. Does anyone know what the protocol is exactly for defining an **academic** reference?\n\nI am applying to a competitive research-driven program, hence why I would ideally like these two to be my references – they know me much better than other potential references from my undergrad and could best attest to my research skills.",

        "text": "Hello, thanks for choosing to answer my question. I'm a 20 y/o student from India, and am finishing my honours degree in English in April-May. Here is my situation:   \n\n\n* Wanting to apply for both business programs &amp; English/Creative Writing programs for my Master's, not PhD.   \n\n* Have missed the deadlines for scholarships  &amp; will only spend 1-2 weeks per application. Could not focus on my applications in 2022 because of a traumatic breakup. However, my essays and writing samples are high quality, and I have strong LoRs from USA PhDs.   \n\n* My grades are very good for my Uni &amp; course; I have a first-class with honours (77%) -- British system.  \n\n* I have research published through Asia's biggest science publisher  \n\n\nA gap year has been suggested to me by various well-wishers because of various reasons: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I have a business cum YouTube channel that has millions of views and is growing rapidly. Taking a year off can allow this project of mine to expand and grow to great heights. Additionally, I can publish more research &amp; strengthen my application further. I also have 2 other projects/businesses that can be grown to similar ways.  \n\n2. According to them, spending more time on an application &amp; speaking to counsellors would be a more beneficial way to go about things, considering my circumstances.   \n\n3. I am applying to prestigious schools &amp; programmes out of interest only. I haven't researched the programme outcomes extensively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am uncertain of whether their reasoning is right, as I believe that I can simply apply this year and focus on pros/cons after getting my acceptances.   \n\n\nMy primal concern is that I have a very high score in my degree currently, and am scared that it will fall in my final semesters. Although that is not likely at all (I think it will only rise), I am still speculating that I will have a semester where it will fall from 77% to 74.5% or something, although I'll make it up in the following semester. Another concern is that I'll go into my master's as a 22 year old as opposed to a 21 year old.   \n\n\nWhat would you do in my situation?",

        "text": "TRIGGER WARNING: This post is gonna sound pretentious, and ungrateful, but do understand that I am getting therapy and working through this on my own. I know this is not a good mindset, and I’m actively working to fix it.\n\n\n\nPrestige of schools. This has been a problem of mine that has grown especially since I have been applying to Ph.D. programs this year. I go to a pretty decent school for undergrad, a R1 big ten school and it has been great. I am applying for PhD programs in Statistics. When I was applying to colleges in highschool and picking my undergraduate institution, I was only told to submit applications to the two in-state schools in my area, for financial reasons (by my parents). The school I go to now is great, but I really wanted to go to an ivy league school or a \"target school\", because I felt they had better opportunities, and frankly (and this is the main reason), I just really wanted to feel the feeling of people thinking I was super smart. I mean you think of it right, a person says \"I go to harvard/yale/stanford/berkley\" or some target school, everyone's reaction is \"wow he/she is super smart\".\n\nWell, since I didn't get that opportunity, I felt, let's make a graduate school that chance to go to a target school. I knew I wanted a career in academia or research, and with some positive research experiences early on in my freshman year, I knew a Ph.D. is what I wanted. Well boy did I realize, trying to get high grades in undergrad is nothing like high school. There came covid, which absolutely tanked my GPA one semester, combined with some early personal struggles in my priorities in college. I am graduating with a degree in Statistics, around a 3.4 GPA after grinding for 4 years, and now realizing my dreams of going top 5 or target school for my Ph.D. in Statistics is probably never going to happen, since frankly, I don't have the academic stats to compete. After realizing this about 4-5 months ago, I have absolutely resented myself and regretted everything I have done for the past 4 years, and feel like an utter failure. I have an innate hatred for myself for not having my priorities straight, and wished I had tried harder. At a certain point, I even regretted making so many friends in college, and wished I was alone and isolated to focus on school more in the early years because I felt they \"sucked my time away\" from school. I have an insane amount of jealousy for others who are going to be able to go to a Stanford/Berkley/Harvard/UChicago or other target school for their PhD and I don't know how to feel anymore, as I have felt like I have missed out on the experience of going to a prestigious institution. I have always felt like ivy league graduates and being affiliated with such are given special treatment and are favored more for better opportunities, and I feel jealous of them. Deep down I want that for myself because I feel that ivy league kids and target school kids get all the praise and I want to feel that, and frankly, I am sick and tired of people writing me off for my school all my undergrad, and I want the opportunities and feeling of being praised as they did (I know, it sounds horrible). I also have felt like me, going to a non-ivy has held me back as I have not gotten the opportunities they got.\nMost people would not let something like rankings phase them in the graduate application process, and realize that ivy is not everything to worry about, as even 20-30th ranked departments are really good, and there are brilliant people working there. But I feel super insecure about it. I am realizing that this insecurity stems from two reasons:\n1.me having moments where I felt smart, and thought I was of that quality of an ivy league student and regretted being at the institution I was currently at,\n2.me realizing that there are people who are way better and smarter than me and that are more deserving than me of such schools has made me think less of myself.\nIf you were to ask me truly why I would want to attend such schools, it's not because \"I like xyz faculty in the department\", or \"I truly love their research\". It's because I am insecure about not ever having people tell me I am smart, and I feel as if this ivy league phd degree will make others look at me like a genius. I also faced extreme school discrimination in undergrad when going for competitive internships (quant finance &amp; trading, tech internships) where I found that the jobs I had interviewed for these top companies (I made it to several final round interviews before getting rejected) were instead given to students who went to harvard, berkley, uchicago, or other target schools. I was so angry. I was devastated for days, and I hated these rejections as it felt it was totally unfair and out of my control (I mean its just my school!). I told myself that I should deserve to be in a room with those people because I felt I was as smart as them and hence dedicated my time in undergrad to trying to get into such a school for my Ph.D., telling myself \"if I get into a target school, I will be the one who gets these competitive jobs, and never face this discrimination\". and now that it's not gonna happen I feel hopeless.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where now, I am just disgruntled about where I will probably end up for my PhD and have started thinking about trying to get a postdoc position at one of these schools out of spite to prove to myself that I can. It's not like I even want to do a postdoc, I just want to be able to tell people and have others see that I was at a school like that.\n\nClearly, this is a really bad mentality, but I just don't know how to kick it. I want to nip this in the bud now because I don't want to carry it into grad school and become a competitive asshole to everyone around me. This is how I was in undergrad and I hated being like this, and I burned a ton of bridges. Now that I have an opportunity to be a grad student, I feel the same feelings 4 years ago, me telling myself \"dedicate your time to setting yourself up to getting a post doc at a target school, prove to yourself and others that you could do what you couldn't in undergrad and in your PhD, and do whatever it takes\", and I don't like it. I want to change, but the whole prestige and rankings thing has given me a bad perspective.\n\n\nTLDR: Insecure about the prestige of grad school, and don't know how to change my mindset.",

        "text": " \n\nThe company I work for is funding a project led by a professor at an engineering department in a US university. I was recently accepted by the university and they offered me a departmental fellowship for my first semester with subsequent semesters being funded by the advisor's grant money (which includes a stipend and full tuition). Also, my employer put me on a scholarship that covers my tuition and a very low stipend for the duration of the PhD even though they are also paying the advisor grant money for the project. I am currently in my first year in the PhD program working under the advisor on the project. I realized that the stipend I receive from my employer's scholarship is barely enough to pay for the rent and all the other students working on the same project are being paid an RA departmental standard stipend which is double that of my scholarship stipend. I brought this up indirectly to my advisor in the hopes that he will offer me an RA that at least augment my scholarship stipend to a livable wage similar to my peers (which is the department's policy) however he would give me vague answers and then complains that my company still hasn't paid their grant installment for this year/or how other students are having a hard time finding affordable housing..etc. I just feel like I am being treated like a bargaining chip, even though I am a student and bringing outside money that pays my tuition in full and half the departmental standard stipend. Should I be upfront with my advisor and ask/email him to augment my stipend and hire me as an RA just like my peers who are working on the same project? What if he refuses? To whom should I talk? I don't want to take out loans to compensate for the low stipend since I live in a high-cost-of-living area.\n\nI also checked the grant contract written by my company, it mentions no restriction in me receiving a stipend. I don't want to bring this up to my company management and make things sour between me and my advisor since we get along well and his advising style checks all my preferences.\n\n The admission letter that I signed and accepted states the following:\n\n\"in view of your superior academic achievement and credentials, the \\*\\*\\*\\* Engineering department is pleased to offer you financial support for your graduate studies, contingent upon continued satisfactory academic performance. Our standard support package includes a minimum annual stipend of $\\*\\*\\* (double my current stipend) plus the payment of tuition and fees, including the graduate student health insurance plan.\"\n\nThen the letter goes on to say that\" the department supports students for the first semester,followed by support in the form of a Research Assistantship from the contracts/grants of the student’s advisor.\"",

Haha I’m like should I be seeking out an apartment sooner or wait until I’m done with this program.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading!",

        "text": "During my undergrad in engineering, I’ve been fortunate to develop a close relationship with one of my professors who I’ve worked for as a research assistant and taken multiple classes with. He is a fantastic mentor for me, and we get along on a personal level too. I like his advising style as well. He cares a lot about student’s interests and letting them explore what they want. He gives people the freedom to work without being micromanaged and sees failures as part of the learning process rather than getting upset about mistakes. He only ever has a couple grad students at a time, so he is available to help especially if someone is really struggling. \n\nI already have an idea of the specific areas I would want to explore in grad school, and his research aligns with them well. However, the overall master’s and PhD programs at the school do not. I have a sub-field of engineering I want to specialize in and other schools have degrees specifically for it and coursework to match. This school has more general degree options and the coursework options don’t interest me much. Also, this school isn’t highly ranked but this particular professor is well-known and respected in his field. \n\nI feel like the right thing to do is go to a school with a program that aligns with my interests and goals the best, but I hear a lot of advisor horror stories. While a higher ranked program with better coursework and other interesting sounding labs seems attractive, I’m nervous that I’ll get stuck in a place with lab drama, an abusive PI, micromanaging, and stuff like that, especially because I’m very prone to anxiety. I think I’ve really lucked out meeting a professor that truly cares for me as a person and I don’t want to throw the opportunity away just because I think things could be better somewhere else.",

        "text": "I (25F) have one PhD interview scheduled for next month at a top research institute for biological and biomedical sciences and I’m terrified.. both of getting rejected and of getting accepted.\n\nI’m terrified of getting rejected because I don’t really know what else to do with my life. I’ve always  had this goal to do a PhD eventually so I could land higher, leadership positions in industry.\n\nI’m terrified of getting accepted due to what a PhD entails. I am terrified that I’ll be wasting the rest of my 20s. I love my work/life balance right now. I love getting off work around 4/5PM. I’m a gym rat, I love working out at least 2 hours a day (4-5 days/week). I just started climbing, and I love it and want to spend more time doing so. I love doing weekend trips, going hiking or swimming/skiing (season dependent), I love turning my brain off after work, and spending time for myself (gym, cooking, relaxing), or quality time with friends. I see my friends and family almost every day.\n\nCurrently, I work at Harvard Med School (for two years, since graduating undergrad), and I know I’m a diligent worker. I have 5 co-authorships (within those, two in preparation), including one Nature co-author. While I like research, I don’t have a desire to sacrifice my mental health and personal life due to a PhD. I cannot see myself working 60-80 hours a week, and because I don’t care for academia I hate the thought of having to waste research time for teaching and taking classes.\n\nI wish it is the norm for PhDs to just focus on research on a regular schedule (8-5ish, more if needed occasionally), and allowing to lead a wonderful personal life. I know, however, that is not the norm.\n\nI have a huge fear of going to grad school, because honestly I’m not that passionate or that much of a hard worker. I’ll get things done, but I don’t have a desire to push my physical and mental health for this. If I get admitted to this program, I’d be moving from Boston (where I have a huge support system amongst family and friends), to The Triangle in NC (which I know nothing about, but NC doesn’t seem that interesting).\n\nI know this is program and professor dependent as well, but even though my current PI at Harvard is probably one of the most understanding and wonderful and helpful PIs who genuinely cares about the grad students (and everyone in her lab), everyone still consistently works their asses off, and just trudging along to hit the finish line.\n\n-\n\nTLDR: Can you have a life during grad school? Can you relax? I’m also single but would like to date in grad school, is that possible? (Most of the grad students I know have been in long term relationships before starting, or are engaged). Can you consistently work out? Do you have to live and breathe science?",
