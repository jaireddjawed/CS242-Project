        "text": "Disclaimer: I think the term redskin is a totally offensive racial slur in any context in 2014, and I think that it is totally wrong to have a football team that goes by that name. \n\nIn an [article](http://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/heat-index/2014/10/07/redskins-cardinals-nickname-nfl-spin-offensive-native-americans-logo/16859015/) in today's news, sports columnist Paula Boivin regurgitates the folk-etymological claim that \"redskin\" refers to the bloody scalps of American Indians, who were hunted for sport and bounty.  \n\nUnfortunately, this claim isn't grounded in fact.  Ives Goddard, a linguist with the Smithsonian Institute, conducted a lengthy [survey](http://anthropology.si.edu/goddard/redskin.pdf) and found that the actual origin of the term is \"entirely benign.\"\n\n&gt;[The word *redskin*] emerged at a specific time in history among a small group of men linked by joint activities that provided the context that brought it forth\n\nThis doesn't mean that the word isn't offensive today.  Of course it is.  Redskin has been used as a racial slur for over a hundred years.  But words can pejorate over time, a phenomenon that is quite common, as illustrated by the histories of words like [bawd](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bawd&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) and [egregious](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=egregious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0).  The point is to understand how language changes and how benign terms can become offensive ones -- and NOT to try to anchor offensive words in some mystical past.",
