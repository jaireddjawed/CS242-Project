This caused the argument, as I argued that one couldn't make statements about a text based upon personal experience. That's the premise, I'll try to give some more detail here:\n\nSeveral women reacted to a poem in a certain way. I didn't think it was an appropriate reaction, and argued that they were interpreting the poem in a way I didn't think was intended / correct. They argued that their opinion was more valid than mine (I agree with the principle of some opinions being more valid than others) because they had experience as women and therefore could interpret the text with higher clarity. I argued that the individual's experience / opinion doesn't have particular value when discussing the texts meaning, and especially it doesn't allow the individual to impose their ideas on someone else, even if the individual is female which would not allow the male to understand the female experience.\n\nSo, the question. I don't really understand the social science or anything behind this debate, and I was wondering if anyone more learned could direct me to some political theory or give me clarity on the situation.",

In other words, most people unknowingly commit the naturalistic fallacy of thinking because some group historically evolved a certain way, society *ought* to reflect and reinforce those differences.\n\nHe seemed to suggest, even if we're educated and aware of this fallacy, we tend to unconsciously internalize the knowledge of these broad differences and apply it to individuals of said group.

Both are very interesting. They both show how, in many Southeast Asian countries, social science has become deeply intertwined with government's interest since colonial era and often used as a tool to legitimize the marginalization of the poor and ethnic minorities under the pretense of \"development\" and \"civilizing mission\". Social science critical to government policy is almost no no. It still is in some SE Asian countries. Scholars opposing Vietnam War like in the USA never happened here.\n\nThen something came to my mind: well India had history of colonialism too, but they seem to be able to give birth to many critical thinkers, especially postcolonial thinkers. Partha Chatterjee, Homi Bhabha, Gayatri Spivak, Balagangadhara, Uma Narayan, you name it. I'm not saying India has much more than other countries, or India has more influential thinkers; I'm just particularly interested in India.\n\nDoes anyone know a good piece on the development of social science in India? Especially how did India give birth to many critical thinkers, like those on postcolonialism?",

It supposedly died out due to \"improvements in street lighting, domestic lighting and a surge in coffee houses,\" daily routines in the Industrial Revolution,  and other general stuff that made nightlife *cool* instead of just a time for criminal activity. \n\nWhat are the sleep patterns of communities that live off the grid, such as the Amish? They aren't as reliant on artificial light sources (i.e. electricity) and often stick to agricultural/domestic labor rather than office/factory work... these seem like major factors of the sleep schedule revolution.

I did my best to use the most modern methods at the time, and I think I did quite well. I really enjoyed using modern research methods when most of the others in my bachelors did pretty tame, boring stuff.\n\nFor my master's thesis I'm seriously considering expert interviews, because the topic pertains far more to the technicalities of how the state, international organisations, NGOs and civil society cooperate than the target group. Needless to say, there are a lot of smart people from all sections who disagree on the interpretation of the law, how it should be, and how good it is, and I'm confident I've access to some from all sides. \n\nHow do I best use this quite unusual access to people's time? Should I have a very clear idea of my paper's title question before, or should I see where the interviews take me once they're done for a more precise idea (obviously I wouldn't go in blind but well-researched)? Are there some state-of-the-art new funky methods that could be more interesting than simply putting down a recording device and reading questions? Would you send them questions in advance or just the general topic? How many people should I interview?\n\nI'd love to hear about your experiences and see where \"expert interviews\" stand in today's social sciences.",
