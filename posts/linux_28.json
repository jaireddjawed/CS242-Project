Below are the programs and websites I use to run my business:\n\n\\- Microsoft Excel\n\n\\- Microsoft Word\n\n\\- Notion\n\n\\- Facebook\n\n\\- Facebook Messenger\n\n\\- Facebook Marketplace\n\n\\- Kijiji\n\n\\- eBay\n\nI currently use FireFox on my M1 MacBook Air, but for my mental health, I really need to separate different aspects of my life (school, business, job, extracurriculars, hobbies, etc.) so I figured, giving my business its own tech would be a good start.

Currently I have it set up so that when a host goes offline, it sends a notification via pushover to my phone. Wondering if any Linux programs would offer similar functionality?",

So I just have it power off on lid switch.\n\nI really didn’t expect much from this heap but it works great! Super snappy, super reliable for my needs.

I'm making this post in case someone out there, like me, is having trouble with the HD Graphics 520 crashing when under heavy load and hopefully this might also work for other iGPUs suffering from the same issue.\n\nUsually when doing GPU heavy tasks, your desktop might freeze for a few seconds or even crash the entire session (if you're unlucky). You'll get an error like this one on dmesg:\n\n`i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] GPU HANG: ecode 9:1:85dffffb, in Xorg [2300]`\n\nFor me this only happens when using the Iris driver which is the default for my card, changing it to the old i965 driver seems to not only have fixed the issue but reduced GPU usage when OBS is running.\n\nThe only thing you'll need is to set an environment variable: *MESA\\_LOADER\\_DRIVER\\_OVERRIDE*\n\nOpen the file **/etc/environment** as root with any text editor (with **sudo nano** or **sudo vim**) and add this to a new line: `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965`\n\nThis will set the variable for every user on the machine (at least on Ubuntu 22.04) so that anyone logging into any session will be using the old driver instead of the Iris one.\n\nNow log off and log back in and hope it fixes the problem for you. This works with both X.Org and Wayland. This variable can also be set individually for any applications that might have problems with the Iris driver like SDL-only PPSSPP.",

        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/108k1da/linux_namespaces_ipc_namespace/",
        "text": "In the first part of the series we have talked generally about what are namespace and what we can do with them - in case you want to go over it you can use the following link [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68). Now we are going to deep dive into the IPC (inter process communication) namespace.\n\nThe goal of the IPC namespace is to isolate between different IPC resources like message queues, semaphores and shared memory. We are talking both on System V IPC objects ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sysvipc.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sysvipc.7.html)) and POSIX message queues ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq\\_overview.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html)). In order to use “IPC namespaces” the kernel should be compiled with CONFIG\\_IPC\\_NS enabled ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc\\_namespaces.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html)). \n\nWe can use “/proc” in order to retrieve information about the different IPC objects in an “IPC namespace”. Regarding POSIX message queues we have “/proc/sys/fs/mqueue”. In case of System V IPC objects we have “/proc/sysvipc” and specific file in “/proc/sys/kernel” (msgmax, msgmnb, msgmni, sem, shmall, shmmax, shmmni, and shm\\_rmid\\_forced). For more information I suggest reading proc’s man page  ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html)). \n\nLastly, all IPC objects created in an “IPC namespace” are visible only to all processes/tasks that are members of the same namespace - as shown in the screenshot below. In the demonstration the namespace was created using “unshare” ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html)), the IPC resource was created using “ipcmk” ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcmk.1.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcmk.1.html)) and the show information about System V IPC resources using “ipcs” ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcs.1.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcs.1.html)).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/renh07yyz9ba1.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1f4f2a6a8d8da9815ca545aafc06ce2803ab79fe",

The dmesg buffer logs errors like \"Buffer I/O error on dev dm-\\[N\\], logical block \\[N\\], lost async page write\"\n\nIs there a way to tell mkfs to not be unreliable and crash out with that error? Or, is there some sort of kernel setting that can be set with sysctl to automatically retry on I/O errors to make the system more reliable? EMC says it's a software problem on the SAN that causes an error on about one out of every hundred thousand writes, but the update is very expensive. If I can't find a workaround, I'm going to have to continue supporting a gigantic MySQL database on Windows since we don't have the budget to spend on the update from Dell/EMC.\n\nI know the hardware works fine if you retry.

        "text": "I worked for Apple many years ago, and due to this have ended up with many old PowerPC &amp; 68k Macs in my possession. I’ve dutifully moved them from place to place over the years, mostly due to my desire to not seem them end up in a landfill. \n\nMost are laptops, like a PowerBook 100 and a few of the colourful, toilet-seat-shaped  iBooks, but I also have some desktop machines that I believe still have some useful life left in them, but MacOS has utterly abandoned them by now. \n\nIf I wanted to resurrect these old dinosaurs with a passably-modern, Linux-based OS, what distribution would you suggest I look at first? I’m more concerned about the PowerPC machines, but I’d also love some advice about the Motorola 68k machines. \n\nThanks in advance for any guidance you’re able to provide.",

        "text": "Hi \n\nI tried to go back to windows today. For ease of use of office and photoshop and general less headaches. But i quickly turned back. Thanks GOD i had a perfectly set up clonezilla backup of my beloved linux mint\n\nWindows desktop is absolutely unusable. I am wholly accustomed to window managers (i3 specifically) and couldnt cope. Yeah i know there are wms for windows, but they are super badly integrated. I couldnt find a single one that removes window bezels, task bar and is super responsive as i3wm.\n\n\nEven with tiny10, the system was bloated. Normal ram usage was 1.\n5 gb , whereas with my linux install its 400 mb. The pc would heat up when doing basic tasks such as opening a browser or any program really. Just how badly is this OS coded? On linux my systems cool as a corpse. \n\nBattery usage. Oh my god, battery usage. I couldnt believe it. Windows was slurping more battery than linux. And by a significant amount. Which is very strange , because in my prior experiences, windows was the battery king and linux the hogger. But then again , i was using arch back then. Mint + newest kernel is giving me atleast 50% more battery than windows.\n\n\nLast but not least, i wasnt feeling secure and comfortable. With linux i know im secure both due to obscurity and design and the fact that whatever i install is kind of peer reviewed. But with windows , even without anything installed , i wasnt feeling comfy due to the backdoors.\n\n\nSo yeah , f*** windows",
