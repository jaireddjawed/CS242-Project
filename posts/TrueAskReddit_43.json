I always say it when I see someone in uniform and if in line at fast food or the gas station and they aren't getting a lot I offer to buy it for them. I don't have a lot of money so I can't offer to buy their whole tank of gas or something but I figured its the thought that counts. After reading some posts on the matter on reddit I realized I might me wrong. So to all of you who are serving and go somewhere public in uniform or fatigues, should I not do this?\n\nEdit: People can obviously say whatever that want, but it seems kind of presumptive to assume you know how a serviceman or women feels on the topic unless you are one of them or discussed the topic with one of them. \n\nEdit 2: To those who are in the forces. Thanks for the input on the topic. Some very good input and ideas.\n\nEdit 3: Before you reply, please ensure you have read the last line of my original post. Thanks again to all those service people who replied with their feelings on the matter.",

        "text": "So today I was at the Harrisburg, PA greyhound station waiting for my transfer, and a man approaches me asking for money. Immediately, I was already tuning out. Normally, I don’t fall for bullshit stories about needing money for bus tickets, getting home, etc. However, he pulls out his ticket showing his bus leaving at 7:15 am the next day. He was planning to sleep at the greyhound station, but it closes at 10 pm. Apparently, he found an Arab dude who is letting him stay that night for $25. I’ve never encountered a situation like this, but this guy seemed genuine. Being a kid out of college, I understand what its like to not have a place to stay at, so immediately I felt bad for his situation. I checked his ticket, and checked with greyhound’s closing hours, and eventually gave him the money he needed. I don’t know why, but afterwards I felt pretty shitty, like I just got scammed. After logically breaking it down here’s why I have my suspicions. \n\n1.\tHe didn’t carry any luggage or bags with him. Any one traveling distances would at least carry some stuff.\n2.\tIf he didn’t have the cash, why couldn’t he just go to the ATM or something?\n3.\tWhy would he not have a place to stay at and he’s traveling?\n\nHowever, I gave in to the fact that IF he were telling the truth, I’d feel terrible if I didn’t help him. Still, I have a strong feeling I was scammed. To explain the ticket, he might have taken it from the dumpster or something. This has been on my mind, so I felt the need to write it out. I was hoping to see what you guys feel about this. Is this what you would’ve done? Or did I just learn a lesson? \n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/4k3rja/an_ethical_thought_experiment_for_the_prochoice/",
        "text": "Just a thought experiment I thought of. A very common pro-choice argument is that even if a fetus is a person, bodily autonomy trumps their right to life. Because no person has the right to use someone else's body to sustain themselves against that person's will. Therefore, abortion must remain legal because bodily autonomy trumps the right to life.\n\nCompare those ideas to the case of the Siamese twins. One twin is biologically capable of living independently from his/her twin, but the other twin would die as a result of the separation. Does the first twin have the right to claim bodily autonomy and \"abort\" the dependent twin?\n\nI don't want this to turn into just another abortion debate, and I won't say where I stand on the issue of abortion. It was just a metaphor/comparison I had never thought of before today, and I was curious how people who hold the \"bodily autonomy\" argument as a true and valid reason for abortion being legal would feel about this scenario. I would prefer all top level comments to come from those pro-choice people who hold the original view I stated ([even if] a fetus is a person, bodily autonomy trumps their right to life).\n\nInterested to hear all of your thoughts!",

Watching this reminded me of past debates I've had with people about Basic Income and each time the two main problems presented to me were:\n\n1. It's likely not financially feasible.\n\n2. People will abuse it.\n\nThe first point I don't presume to talk about as I am a layman when it comes to economics, though feel free to discuss it in the comments if you wish.\n\nBut the second point. People always refer to how there are already \"so many\" people on benefits and that \"lots\" of them are essentially just taking the piss and want an easy ride. That introducing a Basic Income rewards those people and will encourage others to follow suit. That people will just stop working and the country will break.\n\n**My main question is** what do you think Graeber meant by how a Basic Income solution would reduce the number of parasites? How do *you* think it would achieve that?",

How would such a world look?\n\nI'm envisaging a social movement that would make it socially acceptable for empty-nesters to go back to college and just start everything over.  There would be new things to discover and life lessons to learn.  \n\nColleges would exist that are targeted at adults or adult couples, entry-level jobs suitable for people with work experience would be more plentiful, etc.\n\nIf we focus only on the college life aspect, that's 4 years.  Which is not that long from a 40+ point of view compared to an 18 year old.  So financially it would be a huge sacrifice.  So for people motivated to start over, I see no downside if it was socially acceptable.\n\nAssume that people can stay physically healthy for long enough to make this worthwhile.",
