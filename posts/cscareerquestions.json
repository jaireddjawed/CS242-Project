Their product also seems very obviously great. They made me the best offer they could but it was a pay-cut from my previous salary. \n\nNow, however, a company that very much slow-walked the interview process finally got back to me with an offer, and it\u2019s better than the one I accepted \u2014 at least in most ways. \n\nHere\u2019s what it breaks down to:\n\n**Company A (current company): **\n\nSeed-stage start-up. Already generating enough revenue that they\u2019re not planning on any additional funding (Not pursuing Series A).\n\nSalary: $150k \n\nBonus: \u201cBonus at company\u2019s discretion\u201d but no idea what it is \n\nEquity: A quarter of a percent. I\u2019ve been told this is pretty good.\n\n**Company B (new offer)**\n\nWell-funded Non-profit with product launch planned for later in the year.\n\nSalary: $175k \n\nBonus: 15% target \n\nEquity: none.\n\nIn my heart of hearts, I have nothing but respect for the company I accepted an offer at. I like all of them as people. And they offered me a good chunk of equity and it seems quite promising that they\u2019re already generating such revenue at seed stage.\n\nHowever, my more provider, father, numbers-oriented brain is looking at the higher salary and bonus (which is more guaranteed than equity) and seeing potential for roughly ~$50k more per year.\n\nI\u2019m really torn. If it came down to which company I like better, I would choose to stay. But it\u2019s really hard to accept lower pay in the mean time for the lottery ticket that is equity in the future. \n\nAny advice?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1675873766.0},{"title":"Hard Decision","author":"acciozeppelin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/10x2x20\/hard_decision\/","text":"If the money were to be the same: to accept an offer from a big name security vender that would be in most scenarios stupid to pass up or to stay where I\u2019m at due to knowing the job security is much better where I\u2019m at.

So fast forward to 9 months ago, I took as many Linkedin Learning courses on QA Engineering such as Selenium, Jmeter, how to do regression testing etc etc. About a month later I received an invitation on Upwork for a role as a QA Engineer for a small offshore team (<10 devs). After a 10ish minute call interview, I was hired and was told to start the next day where I began my onboard training from the current QA who was being let go. My onboard training consisted of doing a full life cycle test on the website and then beginning to work on Jira tickets which consisted of testing new features and testing new fixes. After about two weeks I was the sole(only) QA for the team and my job was spending my free time building an automation suite in selenium and C#, stress testing with Jmeter, and manually testing about 5-10+ tickets per day. For the first few months, I was pretty happy working and was even offered a full-time job with benefits, but then little things started to pile up.\n\nFirst I started to realize that we kept on getting the same\/similar bugs reported that devs would constantly release and I would have to check almost every ticket for the same\/similar bugs which results in almost every other ticket failing at least once before it was released. So I started suggesting to my boss that the developers needed to implement unit testing (which they had not been doing) and at first my boss agreed and told the developers to implement but because my boss never actually looked at their code (as far as I know) they never implemented it which as the project grew bigger more and more bugs started appearing which began harder to detect on the first go around of testing which lead to more bugs being released. I am for sure to blame for some of these bugs going through since it is my job as a QA to test every feature vigorously but since the developers do not test their own code it's even less opportunities to find the errors before they are pushed to live. This was around the 5 month mark and my full-time job offer from month 1 never came to fruition - I was constantly told that \"we would talk about it another time\" when I brought up the offer they had already given me.\n\nAround this time I was told I needed more attention to detail because some bugs were slipping through into live - some were definitely my fault and some could have easily been prevented if the devs tested their code and implemented unit testing but after all it is my job to make sure bugs are not released.\n\nFast forward to these last two months and we are bringing on and letting go developers left and right and the application is riddled with bugs. I'm assuming that we are hiring cheap labor developers and holding on to the good ones but since we are getting low-quality developers we are producing low-quality code (and again, no developer is testing their code before sending it to me) so what little code does go through to be released ends up producing more bugs down the line.\n\nNow this week I have been given 2 weeks notice due to poor attention to detail and will be responsible for training my replacement which I agreed to.\n\nSo after these 8 - 9 months of employment, I am wondering what I could have done differently, are all QA jobs going to be like this, and what should I do now looking forward? Any general advice?\n\nI'm spending these last two weeks utilizing as much as my free time to get my ISQTB certification so that I can fluff up my resume and hopefully land a job with a better work environment.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1675790463.0},{"title":"Should I switch to CS while I still can?","author":"scenetaec","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/10w4jxq\/should_i_switch_to_cs_while_i_still_can\/","text":" \n\nHello all,\n\nI am a student currently studying \u201cWirtschaftsinformatik\u201d (very loosely translated to Information Systems) at one of the top German \/ Austrian universities.

On day one he basically threw him into the codebase unassisted and it wasn't till the week later that I realized and took a morning to walk him through our setup.\n\nThe new hire lied about his level of experience. There's no nicer way to say it. He was hired for a senior position and is a junior at best. I kid you not I had to walk him through using git his first week on the job.

I currently have two offers to choose from, each from a Big 5 bank (Canada).\n\n**Bank A**\n\nI worked at Bank A last Summer as a SWE intern and it was not a good experience. Most of the work had nothing to do with coding and when it did I was kept on a leash (they didn't even let me commit code myself, I had to send my changes to another dev who would deploy them). While it was a bad experience, I feel like I just got put on a team that really didn't need me, as I heard good things from other interns about their experiences. Also, my HR manager told me that our department had hired a few hundred more interns that Summer than the previous Winter term.\n\nA few weeks ago, I reached out to my recruiter about opportunities for this Summer and ended up getting an offer for the same role, but I'd be returning on a different team. I accepted it because I thought it would be better than nothing and hopefully I would have a better experience this term. But they can't tell me which team I'll be placed on or any other details about what I'll be doing until April. So I really have no idea as to whether it will be a better experience (but to be honest, it couldn't get any worse).\n\n**Bank B**\n\nI got the offer from Bank B a few hours after my interview today, where I spoke to who would be my manager. So unlike Bank A, I know what I'll be working on, the tech stack, etc. It sounds interesting and something I would like to do. \n\n**My Dilemma**\n\nBank A is paying $27\/hr and Bank B is paying a little over $25\/hr. So not a huge difference and as an intern, pay isn't the most important factor to me anyway. But if I now renege Bank A to work at Bank B, I'm worried that will hurt the relationship moving forward. I'm not at all set on wanting to return to Bank A after I graduate, but if they were to give me a full-time new grad offer I figure I could at least use it as leverage.\n\nSo I would like to hear peoples' opinions on how I should proceed. I understand a lot of this comes down to what I want to get out of it and perhaps I am forgetting to consider other factors, so I'd appreciate any comments on other things to think about or to ask myself before making this decision.\n\nThanks.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1675822512.0},{"title":"TripleByte assessments mean much?","author":"nedal8","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/10wobkk\/triplebyte_assessments_mean_much\/","text":"Was taking some of these and was wondering how good of an indicator they really are?
