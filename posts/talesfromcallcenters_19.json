        "text": "Me: Thank you for calling the medical center. How can I help you?\n\nPatient’s mom: Yes I’d like to have my [adult] son see a psychiatrist for depression. \n\nMe: Let’s take a look then. [verifies chart details] So most of our mental health services go through Hospital A. We can certainly set him up with a new patient phone screening appointment if you’d like. \n\nPM: Hospital A? Hospital A isn’t very good. Don’t you have any mental health at Hospital B? \n\nMe: We do have one clinic over there but they’re only taking new patients with medical referral from an internal provider. It looks like he hasn’t seen any of our providers so if that’s the route we want to go I’m sure we could find a clinic with an upcoming new patient appointment to get the ball rolling in a referral. \n\nPM: A referral? Why are you making us jump through so many hoops! This is going to take so long. \n\nMe: If we don’t want to go about getting a referral then I can certainly schedule him without one at Hospital A. \n\nPM: No we don’t want to do that. Let me get my husband. He’s a doctor. \n\n[noise in the background of patient’s mom explaining to dad what’s going on]\n\nPatient’s Dad: Hello?\n\nMe: Hi I was just speaking to your wife about our options for mental healthcare for your son. \n\nPD: So our options are Hospital A without a referral or Hospital B with one?\n\nMe: Yes that’s correct. \n\nPD: Well I’m a dermatologist so I’m a doctor and I can tell you for sure he’s depressed. Can’t that be enough to get him in at Hospital B? \n\n[Yeah because being a dermatologist makes you an expert in mental health?]\n\nMe: No sir. My scheduling instructions are very specific. He needs a medical referral from a provider within the Medical Center system. I have a clinic near him with new patient appointments as soon as Monday. \n\nPD: But that’s going to delay his care and we want him to be seen ASAP! \n\nMe: I’m sorry but those are the options I have. I’m following the scheduling instructions given by the clinic. \n\nPD: But I’m a doctor! Can I speak to a manager at the clinic? I’m sure they could bypass this and make an exception. \n\nMe: Certainly I’ll get you over to the clinic. \n\n—",

I guarantee he just got good use of a pan but someone in our company thought slapping a “lifetime warranty” sticker on our stuff was a good idea so we had to deal with people abusing the crap out of their cookware and then expects us to replace it. \n\nAlso, at the time, the company was owned by 4 or so investors under a corporate name and there were no stock options available to the public. And I know it was none of them. Rich millionaires were not buying our products and then calling to complain about them! Lol\n\n\n",

I want to buy a new phone because my ex boyfriend keeps hacking into my number and stalking me.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Alright... I'll be happy to assist you with this order\" *proceeds with order*\n\nEverything is going relatively normal save for a few offputting comments and I go through getting her a new phone. At this point we're about to close and no more calls are coming in. A couple of guys sitting near me were talking about Football and laughing loudly which maybe they shouldn't have been doing so loudly, but the customer heard in the middle of our conversation and it absolutely triggered her.\n\n&gt;Her: \"You know what I don't think I want to buy from you. The fact that you have losers listening to our call and laughing at me is so unprofessional!\" \n\n&gt;Me: \"Ma'am, I'm sorry you feel that way. I can assure you anything you hear in the background is unrelated to our call and no one is actively listening but I am more than happy to help you get your new phone.\"\n\n&gt;Her: \"I don't think so. The last girl who hung up on me was super sweet and hella cool. You? You suck.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"...Okay... I'm sorry you feel that way but—\" \n\n&gt;Her: \"Wow they stopped laughing. You clearly just told your idiot friends to shut up because I said something. This is fucking ridiculous. I don't want to talk to you.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Ma'am I don't—\" \n\n&gt;Her: \"Stop talking to me!!! You're a thug and I HATE violence!\"\n\nShe then proceeds to ramble on, basically cursing me out about how my company hires miscreants, how I'm incompetent and an idiot for another 10 minutes before hanging up. I think she used the N-word a few times too but I had her on mute and just drowned her out. \n\nSo in case #483738 of call center agents can never do anything right, don't let your coworkers laugh because that means you're a violent thug.

I work for a large insurance company as an auto insurance rep and I've been on the phone for a total of four days so far. Surprisingly, most have been pleasant, except for this gem.\n\n$me = me $am = angry member\n\n$me: Thank you for calling [Company], my name is Noddy. Can I get your first and last name please?\n\nAM gives name, goes through verification, every thing seems to be good so far.\n\n$am: Do you guys insure vehicles with salvaged titles?\n\n$me: I would be glad to look into that for you, may I place you on a brief hold while I access your policy? (I knew the answer to this, but I also wanted to be able to explain it fully)\n\n$am: Sure, I'll hold.\n\n(about 45 seconds later)\n\n$me: Thank you for holding. Yes, we can insure a vehicle with a salvaged title, however, the salvaged title will be taken into account when determining the actual cash value of your vehicle in the event of a total loss. However, we will still charge you the full premium.\n\n$am: Um, can I get that in English, please?\n\n(this is where the call took a turn; it doesn't take a genius to figure out what I just said)\n\n$me: I apologize, sir. What that means is that because the title is salvaged, the car is likely worth less than one with a clean title. So, even if the vehicle is in the same current condition as one with a clean title, the actual cash value would be diminished and would be considered by an adjuster if you were to have a total loss. That being said, we would require you to pay the prem...\n\n$am: What is actual cash value? How do they determine that? What is the actual cash value of this vehicle?!\n\n$me: Well, there are various factors taken into consideration: condition, mileage, depreciation, and the title are a few. We also use KBB and the selling price of similar vehicles.\n\n$am: But I want you to tell me the actual value of MY vehicle.\n\n$me: I apologize sir, but I have no way of being able to determine that. I can tell you the KBB value of the vehicle, but I have no way of determining anything further, especially considering the salvaged title. *types in VIN to get value of year, make, model* I see here that the average price of this vehicle with a clean title is around $8500-10,000. \n\n$am: *becoming increasingly irate* But I want to know the value of MY CAR. I already looked at KBB!\n\n$me: Okay, well a good starting point would be how much did you pay for it?\n\n$am: $13,000.\n\n$me: Sir, there's no way that so can even give you a ballpark estimate of the ACV of your vehicle. I can bring a specialist on the line to see if they can assist you.\n\n$am: But it's YOUR job to tell me how much it's worth.\n\n$me: Well, all I can tell you is that you paid almost twice as much for a vehicle with a salvaged title than one with a clean one is actually worth; is there anything else that I can assist you with today?\n\n$am: Goddamn it's not rocket science to figure this out.\n\n$me: Sir, maybe you should Google it. I don't have access to Google or I would have done it for you. I can't assist you any further at this point, so I would like to thank you for being a member of [Company] and hope you have a great night.\n\n$me: *hangs up and looks at my coach* Umm.. now how should I have handled that call, because I'm pretty sure that was all sorts of wrong. \n\nOnly feedback was \"Don't tell a member to Google something\"\n",

I’ve been a customer service rep for over 4 years now, fielding calls at a company that deals with an automotive accessory. The tale that is to follow is the most ridiculous person I’ve ever come into contact with in my whole four years here.\n \nMe: Yours truly\nCL: Crazy lady\n \nMe: This is sn0wed speaking, how may I help you?\n \nCL: Tell me all you know about the function of your product.\n \n(From the get-go I knew this was going to be a shitshow)\n \nMe: Tells CL all about the product she is inquiring about.\n \nHer: Well did YOU know that your product puts people in danger? Why would anybody have this? Do you know that you have multiple complaints about your product? I was stranded with my granddaughter on the side of the road at 5pm on a Saturday night when everything was closed? What if I was on the south side of Chicago in a black majority neighborhood, and YOU (she kept stressing it was ME who was doing this to her, and PS she lived in Eastern KY per phone area code, nowhere near Chicago) got us killed??? How would you feel about getting a CHILD KILLED????????\n \n-At this point she is screaming at me in incoherent profanity and I have muted myself as I talk to my boss about how nuts she is being-\n \nMe: Ma’am what kind of vehicle do you own?\n\nCL: I don’t have to tell YOU that.\n \nMe: Well ma’am I can’t he-\n \nCL: LEXUS WHY DOES IT MATTER? YOU KILL PEOPLE. (I know she’s BSing me because usually when people are mad they blurt out the year/make/model of their vehicles before I can even start, especially with Lexus because it is a luxury brand)\n \nMe: Please hold.\n \nAt this point I put her on an approx. 3 minute hold while I fetch my boss from her office and explain what’s going on. I can’t find her. I take her off of a hold and she continues to rant endlessly without me being able to get a word in edgewise.\n \nMe: Ma’am what would you like me to do? I can replace your parts at no cost and send them out overnight to you free of charge.\n \nCL: WHY WOULD I WANT YOUR SHITTY PRODUCT ON MY VEHICLE????\n \nMe: Ma’am I apologize but I do not know how to help you.\n \nCL: I WANT A MANAGER!!! NOW!!!\n \nMe: Please hold.\n \nMy manager is not in the talking mood so I put this woman through to my boss’ voicemail. My boss then listens to my call with her as all calls are recorded for QA and before she can call back, CL calls AGAIN and demands my manager exclaiming “I better not get a fucking voicemail this time!!!”\n \nMy manager talks to her (aka she rants at my manager).\n \nManager says she’s crazy AF and to not worry about her.\n \nCL isn’t happy with the outcome, so she proceeds after this to harass my front desk with 5 calls, changing her name every single time. Will not stop calling. VP offers to call her. She declines and wants the CEO.\n \nShe then proceeds to call one of our employees out in the field to rant at them. Mind you, they’re in TX, not anywhere near us at the moment.\n \nAfter that stint, we never heard from her again. Yet. We suspect she’s one of those mentally unstable people that call random companies that have had problems (um, like every company?) and she wanted nothing from us but to bitch at us for whatever reason.\n \ntl;dr  crazy lady is crazy and doesn’t really have our product, proceeds to harass me and my whole company.\n \nI have more stories and I’ll be posting more in the future.\n ",

        "text": "TL;DR, don't make promises that can be broken by someone else, because you'll feel like the worst person in the world.\n\nHey y'all. I am at my new and boring healthcare job where I type stuff into a computer all day, and sometimes I miss being at a call center. The customer interactions were generally pleasant where I worked, and I loved my coworkers. However, the way our business worked and how certain people were treated, I couldn't continue working there. \n\nFor context: I worked for a 3rd party company which handled in certain insurance/coverage for phones/appliances for probably the largest electronic retailer. Often times we have people who need repairs on their Fridge and generally that means it is not cooling. Most of the time, we consider this an \"Emergency\" and get someone out to them as fast as possible. We have 5 business days exactly otherwise they get a completely new unit for free. So one day we get a call for someone who has this exact issue. Easy. Set up the claim and send it to Escalations. But the dialouge is something I remember clearly. Fast forward into the claim set up process yadda yadda..\n\nMe - M \nLady - L\n\n&gt;M: Okay, due to the way our scheduler works, we have to submit this to our escalations team and then they will call you back today or tomorrow confirming a date for you. \n\n&gt;L: Well... will they be able to fix it soon? Both my daughter and my husband have diabetes, and their insulin might go bad.\n\n&gt;M: Firstly, I want to say I completely understand your worry, since I am also diabetic, and secondly, I can *guarentee* that they will be able to fix it in time.\n\n&gt;L: Thank you so much, you've been so helpful.\n\nEnd the call, done. Sent everything over to our escalations team and saved her reference number to keep track of.\n\nA couple of days pass, and it looked like no contact had been made to the customer. I took it upon myself to call the escalations team to see what's up. They informed me that her contract was going to expire on XX-XX and they couldn't find anyone to repair it before then so they weren't able to do anything. Otherwise, they couldn't be assed to help this poor woman out. I honestly cried a little at my desk. I told my manager the situation, and sort of ghosted my job after that. ",

        "text": "TL:DR Customer wants material to be delivered  yesterday, but I make a mistake that means it doesn't get delivered on time, then everyone else screws me over so it gets delivered even later.\n\n\nI work in the Railing Estimation Department at a Pacific Northwest skylight, sunroom, and railing manufacturer, and I very rarely take calls. On October 5, I took a call from a California company wanting 5 unpainted (painted is standard) 20' bars of our rectangular top rail, and some end caps to mount the rail to a wall. No problem - or so I thought. The guy asked if we had them in stock, and since I have personally seen them sitting on the rack, I answered in the affirmative. I gave him a quote for the product plus shipping and crating.\n\nNext day, CA customer calls back wanting to order, and asks when he can get them. I tell him two weeks before we can ship them, and he replies with a very indignant \"I thought you had them in stock!\" I explain that, yes, they are in stock, but we still have to pull them off the shelf, inspect for any major damage, and box them for shipping. And that's after all the other customers wanting their railing before the 6-month rainy/cold season begins. \n\n\n\n\"How can we get them sooner?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"You can pay an expedite fee, and that will guarantee that it will ship on Monday October 16th.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine, do that.\" \n\n\nSo I add the fee on top of his crating and shipping charges, and take it to the money handler in the downstairs office. I'm fairly new to the estimation department, and thus I was unaware that CA customers have to have tax added to their orders, so I have to tell an already indignant customer they have to pay *even more* for the product. He begrudgingly accepts the charges, and I process the order, printing out a white copy of the order to go on the floor for the production team, a yellow copy for our records, and a pink copy for the financial department. \n\n\nOn Monday, October 16th, just before I'm about to leave for the day, I get a call from them, wondering where their product is. I look it up, call the production manager, who's already off the clock and doesn't recognize the order. I go downstairs and hunt down the yellow copy in the file cabinet  and pink the pink copy in the rolling file cart, but can't for the life of me find the white. Several trips up and down the stairs,  and I find the white sitting on the file cabinet, having never made it to the floor. \n\n\nOhshit.jpg. Big mistake that was my fault. I call the customer back to brown-nose a bit and ask if he still wants the product. I tell him I will refund the expedite fee, because he obviously didn't receive his order in the expedite time frame. He is understandably upset,  but agrees to this arrangement. So I go to get the pink to edit it, having laid it down somewhere,  and now I can't find it. \n\n\n\nMore trips up and down the stairs, and several instances of going through the file cart folders with the letter of the customer name, and the folders before and after it, and still no dice. I end up printing another copy of all three colors (carbonless carbon paper).  Finally, I find it in the *very back* of the file cart. Some jackass picked it up where I laid it down and put it in the back of the cart, not even bothering to file it by the customer's name. Finally, I'm able to edit the pink and give it back to the money handler to enter into the system.  When she gives me a receipt for the removal of the expedite fee, I scan it in and email it to the customer,  promising to deliver it the next day. \n\n\nThe next morning, I give the updated white copy to the production manager. I spend my mornings helping in production because they're fairly busy, then I go up to the office after morning break for the rest of the day. I tell the manager that this is urgent, and he says, \"I'll take care of it.\" Meanwhile, he had me building display models, which we usually only do when we're not that busy, so I figure he will have one of the full-time production workers box it up. An hour or so before break, I ask him when he's going to do it, and once again, he says \"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it.\" I'm definitely still worried, because I promised that it would ship this afternoon. \n\n\n\nA few minutes before break, the manager calls me over, because he realized that there weren't just end caps on the order, but there were 5   20-ft bars of material. I tell him that's why I was so worried about it, and he asks me to come back after break to pull the order. I had already suspected that I'd have to do it myself, so after break I bust my ass to box those parts, and they're ready to go just before lunch. I give the shipping information to the front desk lady, and she prints out shipping labels. \n\n\n\nA half hour after lunch, she comes up to the office wondering where the boxes are, because she's new, and not used to shipping boxes that aren't in the shipping area. I show her the carts that Railing uses to hold completed orders because there's no room for the  20ft material in the shipping area. She has labels printed for BrownCarrier, and she asks if that's ok. I tell her they have semi trucks that will pick up the long stuff. \n\n\n\nI haven't done much with orders shipped by carrier, so I tell my office manager what I said, and he informs me that BrownCarrier picks up max 8-ft lengths, and we'll have to use PurpleOrangeCarrier, but to confirm with the shipping manager. After confirming, I go down to tell her as much, only to find out my manager has already done so.  She cancels the BrownCarrier order and prints out PurpleOrangeCarrier labels. I think everything is hunky-dory.\n\n\nNext morning, I find out that the order hasn't shipped yet. Turns out that we missed PurpleOrangeCarrier's pick up cutoff of 1:30pm, so they will ship a day late. Thankfully, I am in the right place at the right time, and I'm able to personally help load the boxes onto the truck so I can tell the customer their order has *finally* shipped.",

So it's pretty low key-Very rare to get anyone angry or rude (At least for now, when I learn Physician Side? That'll be a whole new ball game)  So, I get to the verification process and things are red-meaning I need to re-verify it for the patients safety and such. Anyway-Without getting into too much detail, I go on to ask the women if her emergency contact was still valid. \n\nNo-It was not. Her husband of 50 years passed away three weeks prior and she starts sobbing on the phone. She proceeds to tell me how they married when she was 16,and he was 17 and how she thought they would be together until they were in their 90's and it was just absolutely devastating to hear such raw grief and pain from this women. \n\nSo, she's apologizing and Im like oh, Mam, please, it's okay, just take your time because its completely understandable you are upset. I myself am an emotional person so I'm teary eyed and the lady starts laughing when she realized she made me cry as well. \n\nWe continue to schedule and when we get off the phone, she mentions to me to have a blessed day and I return it in kind, because she's just this lovely old women. \n\nTurns out my boss is behind me the half of the phone call and I've just gotten out of training two weeks ago-I'm still a bit nervous and thinking I did something wrong and she proceeds to name every single wonderful thing I did on the phone call, i.e, empathy and the fact I let the phone call go for about 12 minutes (Normal mammo scheduling even with full verification is like maybe 4 minutes?) and  is like this  is excellent customer service never lose the skills. \n\nI just figured a happy (Even if it is also sad?) tale can do us good because after multiple years in a call center, most of the time it's filled with frustration (in my case) or with an unpleasant work environment, so there are always those special cases that make you appreciate every good moment in life and that we should never take anything for granted in life. \n",

        "text": "So, I work at a company that rents daily offices and meeting rooms, other than offer a virtual secretary service (with also an adress for snail post) all day long I'm glued to the phone when I'm not running from a level to the other to fix the clients WiFi connection, explain someone that you cant use a vga cable with a hdmi port and sorting out the clients mail. \n\nWe have 3 mayor types of requests: -info about smth the client sells\n- info about real estates\n- doctors (a clinic, 2 specialists and a general practioner)\nIn the 90% of cases we know squat about said product or apartment so we just send a report to the client with the caller's info (we rarely transfer the call) and let them sort it.\nIt's around 250/300 reports sent in a day, my avarage is 70 reports sent, the record is 120...yay, gotta love the morning shift!\n\nAnyway, it general doesn't bother me to work hard and be on several lines at once (unless it's because a colleague is slacking off) but there are some callers that I just can't stand.\n\n.\n.\n\n\n1. The Jon Snow\n\nUsually calls to inquire about some apartments and knows nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nNotable example: \nM \"hi, It's real-estate-agency here, how may I help you?\"\n\nC \"I saw and apartment\"\n\nM \"Ok, where did you see the advertising?\"\n\nC \"On a sign, on the building\"\n\nM \"And where is this building?\"\n\nC \"I don't know the name of the street\"\n\nM \"A we renting or selling it? Do you remember how many square metres or how many rooms it has\"\n\nC \"I don't remember...\"\n\nM \"Even if you don't know the name of the street can you tell me the general area?\"\n\nC \"It's near the bus stop\"\n\nM \"What line and what stop?\n\nC \"The one I take to go to work\"\n\nM *internally screaming* \"Ok, can you tell me what are you looking for? What's your budget?\"\n\nC \"I don't know\"\n\nThen accidentally on purpose pressed the wrong button and the line fell...\n\n.\n\n\n\n2 - The white rabbit\n\nGenerally wakes up at the last second to call about something they need. They are everywhere.\nStarting uni next week? \"I need to rent am apartment and I need to rent it yesterday\". Buying something online? \"Yeah but I want it this afternoon\"\n\nNotable example.\n\nIt's 19.35, 23rd of December \"Hi, this is client-selling-smartphones online\"\n\nC \"Hey hi, I need a phone!\"\n\nM \"Ok, if it's still avaible you can get in in your shopping cart, you register and pay. The delivery time is between 2 and 7 working day-\"\n\nC \"you mean I wont have it before xmas?!\"\n\nM \"nope, we are also closed for the holidays. We start shipping again in January and only the switchboard is operative\"\n\nC \" can you prioritize my order so i can have the phobe tomorrow?!\"\n\nM \"sir, we close in 20 minutes, it's friday and tomorrow it's Christmas eve. You are not gonna get a phone before January\"\n\nC \"fuck you then\" \n\nM, to the dead line \"you too\"\n\n.\n\n\n\n3 - James Bond\n\nInformations, what informations?! Everything is top secret.\n\nNotable example\n\nC \"i need to talk to client\"\n\nM \"and your name is?\"\n\nC \"he knows me\"\n\nM \"Sir, I need a name\"\n\nC \"oh god, I'm mr X, he knows me\"\n\nM \"I'm sorry but I can't put client through right now..can I live him a message and have him call you back? Your phone number?\" \n\nC \"he has it\"\n\nM *copying the number from the display \"and the reason of the call?\"\n\nC \"he knows\"\n\n.\n\n\n\n4 - The imaginary invalid\n\nThere are two different species, the one who wants to skip work and the one who thinks he's dieing.\nSpeciment one usually calls on a Friday morning, sometimes Thursday, and tries (failing) to pretend he's sick.\n\nNotable example\nFriday, 8.32. C *horribly cheerful at this time in the morning \"hello, i need to see the gp asap. I'm not feeling well *fake cough* and I need a sick leave\"\n\n\nThe other exemplar is usually an old person or the basic idiot who forgot that pills ran out\n\nNotable example, fresh as it happened yesterday\n\nC \"I need an urgent appointment today?\"\n\nM \"are you sick? Do you need a certificate for work?.\n\nC \"no but I must show the doc my blood test!\".\n\nM \"madame, it's not urgent. I can book the appointment for monday morning\".\n\nC \"but the exams are messes up! One is like 20.5 and should have been 20! And I sneezed twice, twice!, since yesterday\".\n\nM \"it's not urgent, no appointment this week.\"\n\nC \"I'll go anyway!!!\".\n\nM \"k, madam, you go and see if the doc will let you in\" *the doc told her to fuck off and call back for an appointment on monday\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's all for now, sorry but I needed to went. Possible updates in a near future. Also, not native English speaker and typing on the phone, show mercy please",

        "text": "So at the call center I worked at, we had a \"Guaranteed by Christmas or it's free\" policy for a certain window of time before the holidays. Well, the company did some pretty shady shit and canceled 20 thousand orders on Christmas eve because they couldn't get the items out in time. We were required to tell them it was out of stock instead of the real reason. The days following after Christmas were pretty packed full of angry people, understandably. I was personally blamed for ruining hundreds of Christmases for some weeks. \n\nI have many of these Christmas cancellation stories, but for now, here's one.\n\nM = me, C = customer.\n\nM: Thank you for calling -business-, how can I-\n\nC: You RUINED my son's Christmas!\n\nM: I'm sorry for the inconvenience, sir. May I have the order number so I can see the issue?\n\nC: INCONVENIENCE? I bought these gloves for my little boy and now he can't have them! These gloves are the ONLY thing he wanted! How am I supposed to look my little boy in the face and tell him the one thing he wanted he can't have? All the other kids on his team will have these gloves and now he'll have to look at them and know everyone got what they wanted but him!\n\nAfter apologizing more and trying to keep him calm, he finally gives me the order number. I see on the order that the $130 gloves had canceled, but the other 10 or so items (all for children, I assume his son) were fine. I told him the gloves went OOS and offered a new order for them with a 10% discount. He proceeded to scream out me.\n\nC: YOU THINK A DISCOUNT WILL FIX THIS?! My CHILD was disappointed on Christmas this year! I had to LOOK HIM IN THE EYES and tell him the ONE thing he wanted HE COULDN'T HAVE! Good job, you RUINED a little boy's Christmas!\n\nHe eventually hung up without a new order. I get that the company played dirty pool, but come on, use this as a lesson that you can't always have what you want when you want it. And if your Christmas was ruined because you didn't get a material thing, you have much bigger problems than gloves.",

I'm no stranger to irate customers, and pride myself on my ability to stay cool and calm. But this lady pushed me to my limit.\n\nFirst off, let me clarify that we were not allowed to transfer to our escalation department unless the customer clearly stated they wished to speak to a manager. So, a lady with a thick New York accent calls and complains that her order canceled. All good, I take a look. 3 jackets she wanted were $90 each, and she claimed she'd purchased them for $30 each on the order.\n\nMe: *after about ten minutes of explaining that the jackets are $90, she's getting more angry* Ma'am, this item was not on a recent promotion, the jackets are listed as $90 each. I don't see any jackets by this company that are $30.\n\nCustomer: Yeah, there's a lot you don't see, you stupid little liar! I'm TELLING you I bought these jackets for $30!\n\nBy this point, I asked if she would like to speak to a manager several times, and she refused, claiming, \"YOU should be able to help me!\" She continued to cuss me and berate me the whole call. Eventually, with nothing else to conclude, I offered to place a new order for jackets with a 10% discount. After minutes of screaming at me, she finally agreed, but only with one jacket.\n\nMe: *still pleasant and placed the new order* Alright ma'am, I've got the order ready to go. All I need is your payment information.\n\nCustomer: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! I am NOT giving you my CREDIT CARD over the PHONE! I don't know you, you're gonna steal my information! You've already showed you're a LIAR, now you're a THIEF too! \n\nMe: Ma'am, I'm not sure how you plan to place the order over the phone without payment information. Our company does not keep payment info on file-\n\nCustomer: LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR GOD DAMN MANAGER! I'M REPORTING YOU FOR STEALING!\n\nBy this point, I had been on the phone with this woman for about 40 minutes, and I gladly transferred her. I'm pretty sure the manager had a good laugh at her.",

Data-only devices are routed straight to us for tech support.\n\nFirst call of the day! 7:30 AM. \n\nCast:\n\n$Me: guess who?  \n$DbL: Disbelieving lady  \n$Supe: My direct supervisor\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Thank you for calling Tentacle Support, My name is Urashk, how can I help you?\n\n&gt;$DbL: I have a bit of an odd request. \n\n&lt;I doubt it's THAT unusual&gt;\n\n&gt;$DbL: My email address is on my parent's account, and I would like to move it to my own account.\n\nNot my department. Email management is handled by Home Internet, except for one specific case.\n\n&gt;$DbL: ....and I have a Mobility Internet device.\n\nDammit. Specific case, my issue.\n\n&gt;$Me: OK. I'd be happy to help you with that.What's the email address you'd like to move?\n\n&gt;$DbL: first.lastname@province.oldISPname.country.\n\nOh crap. ohcrapohcrapohcrapohcrapohcrap.\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm very sorry to say, those kinds of email addresses are not supportable by a mobility internet device. They're only available with &lt;province's&gt; internet service.\n\n&gt;$DbL: Well, that's not what they said!\n\nWhut?\n\n&gt;$DbL: They *assured* me that this could be done, and that you could do it!\n\n&gt;$Me: \"They\" is the Home Internet team? The people who referred you to me?\n\n&gt;$DbL: Yes!\n\n&gt;$Me: I am very sorry about this. The only email addresses that can linked to a Mobility service are &lt;username@oldISPname.country&gt;, or &lt;username@company.web&gt;. The email addresses supplied by &lt;stand-alone division&gt; are non-transferrable.\n\n&gt;$DbL: But that's not what they said!\n\n&gt;$Me: The team who referred you to me for help?\n\n&gt;$DbL: Yes!\n\n&gt;$Me: The team who referred *you* to *me* for help?\n\n&gt;$DbL: Yes!\n\nSigh.\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm very sorry. It cannot be done.\n\n&gt;$DbL: Why not??\n\nO_o\n\nShort answer: I don't know.  \nLonger answer: &lt;Division&gt; was its own independent company, that was bought outright by &lt;National Company&gt;. It is *barely* integrated into the &lt;National Company&gt; systems, and has its own completely separate service teams, support teams, contact details, and kitchen sink.\n\n&gt;$Me: The mobility system cannot support these type of email accounts. All I can suggest is finding an alternate address.\n\n&gt;$DbL: That is *not* an option. I *need* this moved!\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm very sorry. It *cannot* be done.\n\n&gt;$DbL: Put me through to someone else!\n\n&gt;$Me: I apologize, but there is no-one else who can complete this request.\n\n&gt;$DbL: I don't want to talk to you anymore, I want to talk to someone else!\n\n&gt;$Me: But you've reached the correct department, and I have the answer for your request. There is no-one else to talk to.\n\n&gt;$DbL: Then I want to speak to your manager!! I'm sure *HE* will be able to help me.\n\n&gt;$Me: My manager is actually a woman, and I am happy to get her for you.\n\n&gt;$DbL: Excellent! I would be happy to speak with a *woman*!\n\n&gt;$Me: Please hold.\n\nUrashk uses &lt;Supervisor&gt;!  &lt;Supervisor&gt; is super effective!\n\n&gt;$Me: So what did you say?\n\n&gt;$Supe: Exactly what you said.",

        "text": "So my company is going through a dispute with one of the companies who carry 20+ channels. Said company took it upon themselves to run a scroll bar on their channels stating people should call my center if they don't want to see these channels pulled bc they are trying to offer the channels for less and the greedy cable company isn't cool with that. Needless to say, people are freaking out.\n\nSo cx calls in and immediately says \"you aren't going to be able to help me anyway and just so you know, I'm recording this call\". If a cx is recording the call, we immediately have to escalate.\n\nHe has called in three times today, once two days ago and also on the 11th, demanding $1 per day PER channel that the banner is scrolling on bc he pays for a full screen NOT 7/8ths of a screen and he is concerned the banner will be putting a burnt image on his screen.\n\nSo I ask \"what is the issue?\"\n\nHe pretty much says everything notes state and that he is going to sue because not only is the banner risking his tv for a burnt image, it's causing his kids such distress they need a DOCTOR for their anxiety over the possible loss of their channels. I wanted to say if your kids are that distraught over tv, maybe they shouldn't have tv. Whatever though, so I escalate. And explain to the lead what was going on, her response was pretty much \"lol WUT\"....\n\nI checked account for updated notes, she offered a $20 courtesy credit. He said no, said we will be hearing from his lawyer.\n\n\n****UPDATE: Provider of Channels and my employer came to agreement so his kids had to see doctors over nothing. (how are this kids going to get through adulthood?)",

        "text": "I once worked in a one story call center for a government agency. The call center was an old Kmart that the government had purchased and remodeled. We had a mail-room. Being a government agency, we received questionable items in the mail from time to time. The anthrax attacks were still fresh on all our minds.\n\nOne day, near the end of the day shift, we received a notice that everyone stay put when 5 0'clock comes. This was not unheard of as we often had to work a bit after the end of the shift to finish our calls. As I go about my business, there is commotion near the front of the building. I turn around, as my desk was facing the opposite end of the building, and see the security guard in a panic. He is frantic, pushing his way past management who, have seen something the rest of us haven't, gathered near the entrance. He shouts, \"EVERYONE GET THE FUCK OUT!\". As soon as he shouts this, people in [hazmat suits](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/11/22/3219E0D400000578-3488388-image-a-93_1457733865496.jpg) walk into the building.  I end the call I was on and begin to move toward the exit. A row of people in hazmat suits, some carrying weapons, others briefcases, make their way to the back of the call center. Toward the mail-room. My coworkers and I exit the building. Free to go home? Nope. Told to stay put, we cannot leave, go to our cars or go back into the building for any personal affects.\n\nUnbeknownst to us, there was now an invisible perimeter around the building. I am not sure what the security guard was thinking, but more than a few of us spied him get into his car, past the barricades. He steps on the gas, heading toward one of the exits, when a pair of unmarked cars appear, blocking his way. He turns the vehicle around and attempts the exit on the opposite side of the parking lot. Same result.\n\nHerded in like cattle awaiting slaughter, told nothing, we stand there for three hours. I don't know the specific name for this operation, but a [decontamination tent](https://www.eugene-or.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=22867) is set up at the front of the building. There is a huge vehicle staged at the entrance. We see the hazmat team go in and out of the building. Some of my co-workers, management and those in the mail room, are escorted into the tent.\n\nWe are eventually told that there was reason to suspect delivery of a questionable powder to our mail-room. There was concern that the contents may have made its way through our ventilation system. It hadn't, thank goodness. The hazmat team was called in from a nearby military base to comb through the building. ",

Anyway - customer calls in one day from the Local Theme Park entrance. The supervisor voided their season pass for misuse and they demanded that A) I reinstate it, B ) fire the employee, and C) explain why it was voided.\n\n(FYI: the reason was that it was being used by multiple people and being scanned at entirely opposite turnstiles within like 20 seconds)\n\nPolicy is that we don’t give the reason, tier 2 customer care has to do it, about ~72 hr turn. IDK but that’s how it was. I explain this to him, start filling out the form, and all hell breaks loose. Screaming about how much he pays (he has the lowest level pass), how we could provide such poor service, he will never go to the Theme Park again. Asks us to cancel his pass - we don’t do cancellations anyway, but especially not for the Payment Plan program. Then says “well if I can’t use it this month I don’t have to pay this month, right?”\n\nI couldn’t even respond. I was in shock that was even a question??? Haha\n\nHe’s unhappy when I inform him this isn’t the case, promises to have me fired, angrily hangs up to talk to customer care at the Local Theme Park.\n\nA couple days later I get the followup email: Customer became verbally abusive, was caught taking payment from the other people using the pass, and was banned from the property.

My voice is always monotone and nothing gets to me, this work is easy.\nWe get a monthly limit of cash we can give out as compensation for minor problems and mistakes on our end without having to actually look into the issue\n\nIt's near the end of the first month, I have £650 in my cash limit left\nGet a call from an old woman, As follow:\n\nME: Hello Thank you for calling, my name is OP and I am here to assist you blah blah blah\n\n\nOW: Hello darling I was having a spot of bother with my new telephone\n\nMe: Of course, can I have the account holders name?\n\nOW: Oh I just got this from my grandson, I don't have one\n\nME: No problem I can help you set one up right now if you'd like!\n\n\nI help her set up an account, and as I do she tells me about er grandson who was the only one who remembered her birthday I go to put in the phone model/number/etc. \nPhone is blacklisted as lost or stolen\nAsk her if she knows where her grandson bought it?\n\nTells me no and continues fawning over him.\n\nI unblock the phone, give her an extra £50 as a \"birthday gift\" from us, we usually give people with us over a year £10 a year\nalso give her £30 as a sign up bonus. I put in the details, find her a contract and get her payment details and all that stuff\nFinish everything. She thanks and asks if call is recorded\n\nTell her they record mostly everything\n\nShe starts praising me and saying how I should be promoted and get a raise. Thank her and officially gift her £50 as compensation for \"wrongfully blocking\" the phone\n\nnext month, (a week before I left) I get a call from  an old man\n\nOM: I'd like to cancel any contract please\n\n\nMe: Oh I'm sorry sir, may I ask the reason why you are choosing to leave us?  (They have a hardon for customer feedback)\n\nOM:Oh... It was my wifes and she passed away recently\n\nMe:.. I am so sorry, I apologize for my insensitivity and you have all our condolences \n\nOM: I understand thank you. Do we keep the phone or do you take it? It is still new and barely used, It was a gift from my grandson\n\nME: You can keep it or sell it, though it will no longer work with our service and you may have to pay any existing fees and buy out the contract\n\nOM: Oh ok sure....\n\nMe:May I have the details please? The account holders name and the phone number?\n\nHe tells me and it sounds familiar \nIt was the old womans phone\nThere was still £135 still unused and she had only received and payed one months bill\n\nTell him I am seeing some problems with the account and ask if I may call him back? He agrees\n\n\n\nI close out the account with the tiny amount due and nullify the account and contract\nI fill out a reimbursement file, Say that there was an issue and the customer had been forced to pay off the contract when it had been canceled within the \"free trial\" period\n\nIt's for £1000, I send it up, gets approved within the hour, they just throw money at any of the requests\n\nCall back Old Man\n\nMe: Hello sir it's OP, I have some information about your account\n\nOM: Oh yes, what seems to be wrong?\n\nME: I closed the account and cancelled the contract however it seems to have billed you excessively, So I have been approved to reimburse you £1000 for our mistakes\n\nOM: Oh wow, how much did you take? Is it all gone?! \n\nME: Sir, it seemed there was an issue with the account and it slightly over charged you. We have  rectified the mistake\n\nOM: Hold on, what happened to the contract and any outstanding debt?\n\nME: That has been paid when I closed out the account, your wife had credit on her account and an extra £135 was left after\n\nOM: So what's the reimbursement for?\n\nME: During the process of closing out the account I made a mistake and cleared all of the debt and the credit of £135\nThis is why we are reimbursing you.\n\nOM: £1000, really? Because you lost a hundred pound?\n\nME: I am sorry sir that is all I am authorized to give you, I again would also like to give my condolences once more\n\nOM:.....Thank you...\n\n*Hangs up*\n\nThat day made me really happy and sad\n\nI never got called out or caught for it, and after that work was just depressing ",

I look through her account notes, and there’s a section there that says she has a disability or mental illness that she doesn’t deal well with aggressive people etc etc. She had been transferred 5 times. She basically came to me crying. Her account was past due, and she had to speak to our accounts receivable to make payment arrangements but they said none of them were good enough and our accounts receivable reps are known for being awful to people. \n\n\n\nBasically she started the call just talking. Some customers just need someone to listen to them and validate their feelings (not my job but hey, I love making people happy so I’m happy to do it). We were on this call for over an hour and I helped her make a payment arrangement plan that she could afford on a disability status with very little income. I probably spoke for 10 minutes and listened for 50. At the end of the call she was so grateful that somebody just finally listened to her instead of cutting her off and treating her like she’s less than a human and she cried. She requested to speak to my supervisor so I pulled him over and he was writing little notes to document when he submitted it and his notes pretty well contained that we retained her as a customer because of me, and that I was the first person who didn’t yell at her and that I actually listened to her. \n\n\n\nI’m not like trying to sound like I’m applauding myself at all but I just wanted to share one of the few good calls that I’ve had, as thankfully, ALL customers are not terrible people. this is just one of the calls that I think of when I’m dealing with customers that call me every name in the book.

Has anything changed on your end such as usage habits, a child moving back home etc?\n\nIdiot Customer: No nothing has changed. Everything is EXACTLY the same. Your modem is malfunctioning and I demand compensation!!! \n\nMe: (compensation for what????? We don’t even charge for going over, we just throttle) I’m sorry sir but we don’t compensate just because you’re using more data. We can always bump up your package though. \n\nIC: Ya of course you want me to pay you more money. Typical. You guys are unbelievable. I’m gonna cancel as soon as I find something better. \n\nMe: I’m sorry to hear that sir but from your stats it looks like your modem is functioning correctly so there’s really not much else we can do. I can help you go through your devices and make sure they’re not auto updating and help turn down video quality. \n\nIC: I’m not doing none of that. This stupid SmartTV is too confusing. Shouldn’t have even bought the damn thing. \n\nMe: ...when did you buy it?\n\nIC: I don’t fuckin know, 6 or 7 months ago. What’s it matter?\n\nMe: Sir... I can almost guarantee you that’s what’s causing your usage to increase. Do you stream on the TV?\n\nIC: Well the wife watches a lot of Netflix. \n\nMe: Mhmm and did you do any of that before you got the TV?\n\nIC: No\n\nMe: That’s definitely what’s causing it. Netflix uses about 1-3GB/hr depending on video quality. If you’re going to keep using it as much as you are you should really increase your package. \n\nIC: WHAT? That’s impossible!! I refuse to believe that TV uses 100GB a month!!!!\n\nMe: Well I have one and I use over 1000GB a month sir. \n\nIC: Well that’s wrong. No. You people are making it go up on purpose to get more money out of me. \n\n(EVERYONE thinks this. NO ONE can FATHOM the idea that your usage habits can change for a number of reasons, sometimes without you even noticing. And when we explain this to them no one ever fuckin believes us)\n\nMe: Sir I can assure you we’re not. Would you like to increase your package?\n\nIC: NO!! This is highway robbery!!\n\nMe: Then is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nIC: I guess not since you haven’t fuckin helped me thus far!!\n\nMe: Thanks for calling and have a great day!!!\n\nI hate these calls. People who don’t understand how the internet works and refuse to be taught how should be quarantined on their own little island. \n\nI don’t know what’s so hard to understand about paying for what you use. You stream Netflix all day then you need to bump up your fucking package. If you drive your car 10 times as far as you normally do every day you wouldn’t expect your gas cost to stay the same!!!",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying I'm not cut out for call center work. I hate it so much, and I'm not very good with people.\n\nAnyway, this story was a couple months ago while I was working at a large cell phone carrier in the United States. For some background, the company switched their billing system completely back in 2013. When they did so, all the accounts that were in collections were sold off to the debt collector's and they didn't carry over to the new system. We couldn't look up account numbers, phone numbers, nothing. They weren't there.\n\nThis customer calling in about some debt he owes us. He says it is from 2011, and he wants to pay it or get the information of the collection agency. This is the interaction between Me and Irresponsible Customer (IC).\n\nMe: \"Unfortunately, we cannot look that up at this time. All of the debt from before 2013 was sold off when we switched our system. I do apologize for the inconvenience, but the name of the agency would be on the credit bureau's website if you want to take a look there.\"\n\nIC: \"What? You mean it'll be on my credit report for 7 years, but you guys can just get rid of it? Do *you* think that's fair?\"\n\nThe tone of his voice implied that he really wanted to know my opinion on the matter, as though he was so sure I would think it was unfair that I would just agree with him. I didn't agree with him though. The debt was 6 years old, and and soon as it's in collections it's out of our hands anyway. We can't do anything but tell you who it's through. Maybe take care of your debt before it's 6 years old?\n\nOf course, I didn't say all this right away. I didn't really know how to respond at first since disagreeing with the customer on something like that could lead to a bigger argument. That's not how he interpreted the silence.\n\nIC: \"Well, I guess you're not allowed to say how you feel about the matter.\"\n\nI finally decided to speak up. I didn't want the company to seem like it was trying to silence me, and it really annoys me when people gripe at us because they're indebted to us.\n\nMe: \"Actually, I just don't think it's unfair. There are other ways to look up what collector has your debt and we can't do anything if we have the account besides provide you with that information. We aren't legally obligated to keep it, though we do when we aren't making a huge system switch. I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do anyway. We no longer have the account information.\"\n\nIC: \"You don't think it's unfair? Really? You don't think it's unfair that I have to pay you guys, but you don't even have to keep record of it?\" He ranted on for longer than that, but I'll spare you the tirade.\n\nMe: \"Not really, no.\"\n\nIC: \"Well, you're an idiot! Goodbye\"\n\nThen the customer disconnected the call. Looking back, I maybe could've been more professional about it, or just shut my mouth to begin with. It just got tons of calls every day cussing me out because customer's don't pay their bills and that's my fault somehow. I just don't know how you can put of paying a debt for **6 years** and still expect everything to be all hunky dory when you finally decide to pay it.",

Leaving the banking and call center industries altogether. \n\nThis kind of thing has happened before, customer will call in mad that we closed their account or decreased their limit, which is caused by their nonpayment or a random credit check that returned negative info with other creditors. \n\nCustomer calls, I look at the account, the reason for the decrease was actually both of the reasons listed above. Customer claims there was a bank error that caused the late payment yada yada. I was unable to prove that. So we can't reinstate the credit limit because of that plus the credit check. \n\nCue the tirade of insults, she was civil for most of the call. \n\nHi my name is Azkaland and I should be fired because I didn't go out of my way to reinstate the credit limit, I am providing horrible customer service by not fixing it, I should take a look at myself as a person and figure out why I am so inept at my job and find a new one because I am a horrible manager, I need to violate policy because my employees made a mistake, and I should not send her to collections because it's my fault that she has decided to not pay the remaining balance. Oh and I deserve this to happen to me because I did it to someone else. \n\n?????\n\nI don't remember exactly the entire conversation, it lasted about 25 minutes. I ALMOST told her I was quitting anyways because I'm tired of being insulted and threatened by entitled customers day in and day out, but I think she would have been ranting for even longer after that. I hope I don't get many more nasty ones before I leave cuz I just might let out exactly what I'm thinking. I don't mean I'd cuss them out or anything like that, just a simple \"well they haven't made a computer program for us that argues with people so someone's gotta do it until then.\"\n\nBut I also want to know, has anyone else just let someone have it when you knew you were quitting?",

He spoke with the “company” and they set him up on a security package. His loving wife then proceeded to give them all re credentials for her Pear account including her PearID and password. She called in and got me in hopes to fix her mistake…. The interaction below is after I have her change her password.

You just acknowledged that you gave them the wrong password and then you go and change the password to the one you gave them?Do you want to get hacked? Because this is how you get hacked! I have since moved to billing for Pear and the pChimes department is equally as horrible and depressing. ",

        "text": "I work for an Answering Service (AS) for my Tristate area (and some companies across the country). The primary goal of the business is to take messages from customers when the business is closed. If the customer deems the message an emergency (and it fits a certain criteria), we page the appropriate person to handle it. Some companies pay my company to offer after hours basic tech support. Whereas others use the Answering Service to filter inbound calls. \n\nThis specific company in my story today uses AS as a filter, but they had very special rules. We were to answer as the \"Receptionist\". We were never supposed to hint that we didn't work in the office. Of course, it lead to some issues. Especially with creepy stalkers. \n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for calling [Company], My name is BV. How may I be of service?\n\n&gt;Stalker: Uh. Can you get Katie on the line? (car traffic and noises could be heard in the background)\n\n&gt;Me: I can reach out to her extension for you, Sir. May I ask who is calling?\n\n&gt;Stalker: ...Umm..It's me [Stalker]. I'm a customer. Patch me through to Katie, won't ya. She's the receptionist.\n\nWith these clues, I figured he needed to speak with another agent regarding a previous message he left. \n\n&gt;Me: I'm also the receptionist. Maybe I can help. Is this regarding a previous message you left for someone or do you need to be transferred to a specific department?\n\n&gt;Stalker: (his voice is starting to crack) No! I need you to transfer me to Katie. I know she is working now. \n\nCurious, I pull up the employee directory for the company and scroll through it. There is someone with a name similar to Katie but it doesn't state her position. \n\n&gt;Me: I apologize for not understanding earlier, Sir. Is this a personal call?\n\n&gt;Stalker: Yes, you dipshit. It's personal, but I'm a valued customer. Now patch me through, or I'll get you fired. (a loud car horn can be heard) Your boss is a buddy of mine. \n\n&gt;Me: I understand. May I place you on a hold so I can reach out to Katie's extension?\n\n&gt;Stalker: Finally! Yes. Just get me to her!\n\nI place him on hold and pull up the rules for personal calls. Per usual, unless the person calling is a family member, a message should be left. There is also a little script to read to customers demanding direct transfer. \n\n&gt;Me: (Reading the script) Thank you for holding, Sir. It appears that Katie is currently unavailable. I apologize for the inconvenience. What I can do is leave a message for her and she will call you back at her earliest convenience. \n\n&gt;Stalker: Listen here you little bitch, I know Katie is working. Her hours are 8 to 12. And she takes her break at 10:30am. She is available. PATCH ME THROUGH NOW! \n\n&gt;Me: (growing a bit concerned now) May I place you on another hold, Sir? I will reach out to her extension again. \n\nI call my Supervisor and give a summary of the call. Of course, they told me to follow the standard procedure of leaving a message. Until I inform them that Stalker knows Katie's schedule. My supervisor advises I call the woman whose name is similar to Katie's. \n\n&gt;Me: Hello, this BV with Answering Service. Am I speaking to Katherine?\n\n&gt;Katherine: Yes! Hello. Don't you guys just normally forward calls? I've never had to speak with one of you. Sorry! I didn't mean to make it sound like you weren't part of the company. Oh my god, I'm making it worse. \n\n&gt;Me: It's okay, ma'am. I received a call from an irate customer who is demanding to a receptionist named Katie. \n\n&gt;Katherine: That's me! Wait..A customer? What does he want with me?\n\n&gt;Me: My apologizes, but I'm not sure. He only stated he wanted to speak with you regarding his issue. He said his name was [Stalker] and it was a personal call. \n\n&gt;Katherine: I know the guy. He probably wants to ask me out again. Tell him I'm unavailable and that you'll leave me a message.\n\n&gt;Me: I understand ma'am. I have tried, but he still demanded to be transferred to you. He also said something that I found suspicious.\n\n&gt;Katherine: ....What...\n\n&gt;Me: He informed me of your scheduled work hours and when you take your break. Did you, by chance share this information with him?\n\n&gt;Katherine: No...I'm going to go..I'll call you right back. I just..\n\n&gt;Me: When you call, my extension is [number].\n\nShe hangs up and I notice Stalker is still on hold. Over five minutes have passed and he has not disconnected. I was disappointed at this. \n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for holding again, Sir. I tried Katie's extension several times. She is still unavailable. She might be in a meeting. But I can still leave that message for you.\n\n&gt;Stalker: You're lying.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry?\n\n&gt;Stalker: You're lying. I can see her. She's working at the front desk. I'm looking at her right now. \n\nI felt my blood chill when I heard him say that.This guy drove to the main office and was somewhere he could view Katherine. I had to warn Katherine and maybe alert the police.\n\n&gt;Me: She might be busy. Maybe that is why I couldn't reach her. I'm going to put you on hold again, Sir. So I can sort this out. \n\n&gt;Stalker: I don't see you.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry?\n\n&gt;Stalker: You said you're the receptionist, right? I don't see you. Where are you?\n\n&gt;Me: Please hold! \n\nI place Stalker on hold again and quickly call Katherine again. She immediately picks up and I warn her about Stalker. She's freaked out, but calls 911. I call the owner and also inform him about what is going on. He said he'll take care of it. \n\nI look at my phone and see that Stalker is still waiting patiently on hold. Why he has not disconnected is beyond me. I wait a few minutes, staring at the blinking light. I pick up the call and place myself on mute. Listening in, I hear police sirens in the background and the owner shouting at Stalker. I disconnect.\n\n",

        "text": "So I work in an Expedia call center. So we have this thing called Best Price Guarantee. Basically it's if you find the same exact booking within 24 hours of your original booking you get refunded the difference and a coupon of $50. So this Indian fellow calls and it took me ~25 mins to extract what he wants me to do. So before I go on I guess I should mention that you have to send a screenshot of the final payment page of the cheaper booking, and all the details have to be in that one screenshot. So what happened is he sent a request within the first 24 hours as he should have. However the screenshot didn't have all the complete info in it. So naturally his request was denied. So after getting the denial e-mail 72 hrs after submitting his claim, he sends a full screenshot. So he is wondering why his claim is still denied. I sat for 2 hours explaining to him that since the origin claim that was sent within the fist 24hrs was denied any further claim he makes for the same booking will be denied. After the 2.5 hour mark I lost my shit. I raised my voice and explained it to him very violently cutting him off and practically yelling at him. He sat for like 5 secs in stunned silence. And then he just says \"I want to speak to your supervisor\". I praised the lord after that one statement. So I told him \"I'll be more than happy to transfer you over.\" I called my super and told him \"I'm so sorry you have to deal with this guy.\" Got back to the customer sent him over. Fast forward to the next day I met the supervisor at lunch and asked him what happened. He told me that after I transferred the guy my super had spent 4 more hours explaining the same damn shit to the guy. In the end my super told him that his claim is denied and if he sends another one they will not accept another claim from him again. ***ON ANY BOOKING***. And then just hung up on the guy.",

        "text": "On mobile, forgive formatting, etc. \n\nMy absolute favorite call center interaction happened not with a customer, but with one of my new hires. \n\nI was a trainer a few years back, and we were right in the swing of our holiday season hiring. At this time of year, we don't always get the best and the brightest, but many of our accounts just need someone who can be polite and read, so it's not usually an issue. \n\nOur training room had 8 computers set up, but for some reason I had 9 agents in this class. (Which is okay, we are a third-party service and the account I was training on was basically a \"read the script and type what they say\" kind of deal, but I still need to have the reps do some basic setup and let them get used to the system before they get on the phones.) Right away, one of the new hires stuck out as ... a little slower, like she may have needed some hand-holding. So I had her be the one rep without a computer, deciding to do a one-on-one setup with her after the class went out to shadow on the floor. \n\nSo we get through the first part of class, my special project is asking good questions, is participating, and seems eager to get her calls right, which I take as a good sign. I have her watch another rep's screen while I take the rest of the class through setup. I finally turn most of the class over to the floor supes for nesting, and start to work with my last rep. \n\nSP - special project\nMe - myself\n\nMe - \"Alright SP, let's get you set up on the system! Any questions about [program] before we start?\"\n\nSP - \"Oh no, it absolutely makes sense, I'm so excited to get on the phone!\" \n\nMe - \"Great, so I'm just going to make sure all your logins work, and have you practice signing in and out of the phone system so we know everything is all set.\"\n\nSP - \"Wait, what login?\"\n\nMe - \"Your computer logins. For Windows, and for [phone system], and for [client system]. Don't worry, I'll walk you through it.\"\n\nSP - \"I have to use a computer?\" \n\nMe - \"... yes, everything we do is on the computer. Again, we'll get you set up and you're going to shadow another agent for the rest of the day so you can see how it works before you're on your own.\" \n\nSP - \"That might be a problem. I don't use computers.\"\n\nMe - \" ... hmm?\" (I honestly didn't know if she meant she didn't know how, or if she was morally opposed to them, or what)\n\nSP - \"I've never used a computer before, just my tablet.\"\n\nERRRRRR. Hold up. We have a web navigation test and a typing test that all agents have to pass before we hire them. Again, we don't hire rocket scientists, but basic computer literacy is a must, and our hiring team is usually pretty good about making sure our reps have the skills needed. \n\nMe - \"Okay, well, let's just start logging in and see what you're comfortable with. Go ahead and hit 'CTRL+ALT+DELETE' so we can sign you in.\"\n\nSP - \"What? Hit?\" \n\nMe - \"Sorry, no, I mean press the control, alt, and delete buttons.\" I point at the screen so she sees what I'm referring to, because I have a thick Boston accent and sometimes forget to keep it in check.\n\nSP - Looks at me, looks at the screen, then back at me. Then at the keyboard. Then at me. Back to the screen. Her hands slowly rise off her lap. They hover hesitantly over the keyboard. She steals one more glance at me - I'm nodding, encouraging. She smiles. \n\nAnd reaches out confidently, using her pointer finger to firmly press the words 'CTRL+ALT+DEL' on the computer screen. She looks back at me. \n\nSP - \"Okay, now what?\"\n\nMe - \"............................... alright, that was great! Now let's try it on the keyboard.\"\n\nTurns out, in the rush of trying to fill my class and a few others, the hiring team never noticed that SP hadn't actually taken our computer tests. She was extremely polite, interviewed very well, and seemed very excited about the new job, but had no clue how to operate a desktop PC. After FINALLY getting her logged in (I gave up after Windows and just sent her to listen with a veteran agent, didn't bother with the phone system), I went to tell my boss what had happened. My boss laughed for about five minutes and then called the hiring manager to find her resume and test scores. Resume was great, even had call center work, but no test scores to be found.  \n\nWe pulled the agent she was listening with and asked him to keep an eye on her, and try to gauge her comfort level. Apparently, she kept asking him, \"But where are the pens? Where do we get the forms? Where is the phone?\" \n\nAt the next break, my boss and I told SP that we were very sorry, but it didn't seem like we were a good fit for her. She agreed, saying she thought she was going to be on a desk phone and filling out forms by hand. She thanked us for being so sweet, and happily skipped along her merry way. \n\nShe may have only worked for me for six hours, but she's one of my favorite employees ever. ",

After 7 minutes, I manage to squeeze out a name and start drilling into the issues.\n\nC: I’m having...uhhh... issues with...ughhh...it’s not...ugh...loading!\n\nK: I’m so sorry to hear you’re having issues. What exactly is not loading again?\n\n&gt;&gt;by this time I’ve skimmed notes on the account and see that he’s got 3 rounds of credits from reps just to get him off the line. The adjustments put his account in credit. Yet he’s still calling for more. OK!\n\nI finally get the ball rolling and see his issue. His phone is not receiving calls with custom tunes on the line, allegedly. \n\nK: OK, sir. I’m on it! May I put you on a brief hold to further investigate?\n\nC: uuuh..ok...but...\n\n&gt;&gt;here I just cut him off and press hold.\nProceed to ring the troublesome line and I’m being met with the custom tune he’s been complaining he’s not getting. Yay!\n\nK: Sir, I have just performed a call to your line and everything is working fine. Seeing as this is actually a non-issue, all the credits applied today will be rendered invalid. I have reversed everything that my colleagues have put through since the service has been functioning properly all along. You balance is now back to $XX.YY! May I help you with anything else?\n\nC: No, it’s not solved. You don’t know what you’re saying!!\n\nK: Caller, since there has been no new information revealed that would change the predicament, I am forced to keep to my initial response. If there is nothing else that I may do for you today, I wish you a good night.\n\nC: uhhh...\n\nK: Thanks for calling!\n\nbeep, beep. beep.\n\n",

        "text": "My second story today for your viewing pleasure.\nThis gem features an elderly man. I'm just describing it instead of writing out the conversation. It's also a short one. Hope that's ok.\n\nSo this customer wants to know if he can get his bill at a different time of month so he has time to receive it in the mail and *mail back* the payment. I, per SOP, offer and push the electronic options, because the system is not designed to allot time for a monthly bill to be mailed, received, have the amount mailed back in, processed, and applied to the account.\n\nThe most I can do is offer to change the billing date, but explain that I cannot change the overall time table. I direct him to talk to his postal service, per SOP, and that's basically all I can do, since he did not want electronic options.\n\nNow I understand that the older generation did not grow up with computers, and occasionally have an aversion to them. I did not understand why he demanded to speak to my manager.\n\nI told him there was nothing anyone could do, but he asked twice, so I had no choice.\n\nTen minutes, an incredulous manager, and a wasted transfer later, I am left to ponder how customers think our scope of power reaches out any further than calculating and sending a bill. \n\nOh well.\n\n",

I'm trained for general bill assistance - I am not the billing department.\n\nMe: I'd be happy to assist you with that, if you'll bear with me for one moment I'll go ahead and get that information pulled up!\n\nWe have dual screens and multiple systems so it takes me about 15 seconds to gather enough information to respond.

As for the change in internet [tone of voice would have indicated to a sane person that I was finishing gathering information]\n\nIM: why can't you tell me where the change is? Also I need to know this [detailed billing question].\n\nMe: I'm looking right now, I see that there was a late payment fee and some data usage, totalling x amount.

It's the people who didn't train you who should apologize.\n\nAnd proceeds to ask more questions.\n\nMe: Sir! I cannot pull up the information any faster and this department is not designed to answer questions regarding those parts of your account. I am now going to connect you to a specialist.\n\nAs I look up my trainer is smirking at me as she happened to walk by during the rare occasion I raise my voice to a customer.\n\nI transferred, to some unfortunate soul elsewhere, without waiting for a reply.\n",

For example, the frontline agents have a question they aren't sure of, or there are no supervisors on the floor and a customer is very irate and adamant about a supervisor, they call me. \n\nSo, today, I was taking a call assisting someone that was confused about one of our newer products when I hear this from in the background:\n\n\n\"**OH MY F###### GOD! I AM SO PI##ED OFF ABOUT HAVING TO WORK ALL THIS F###### OVERTIME!\"**\n\n\nI quickly and calmly ask the agent who or what was that and was informed this person does this a lot. I sent a lovely email along with a time stamp to that centres' management team along with a timestamp of the call. They listened to it and he was written up right away.\n\n\nSeriously, you're in a call center with people around you speaking to other representitives and customers. Show some professionalism.",
