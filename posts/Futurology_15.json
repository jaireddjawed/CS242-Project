        "text": "So i imagine a club where everything is based on artificial intelligence.\nEntry only with QR code\nAutomated wardrobe\nThe bar completely robotized, ordering on touchscreen and receveing the perfect drink every time. There will be places where leave the dirty glasses and robots will do the rest. \nFor music and dj-ing i see two options: we take 500 songs, the machine will analyze it and with a given pattern they will create a perfect order‚Ä¶so you can select multiple variations, for ex.2 hours lounge music 1 hour warmup music (bpm and other filters based, 4 hours dance music with ups and downs and so on‚Ä¶\nThe second option is that everybody who will attend the party will select 5-10 songs from a special application created by the club and linked to the AI that creates the music, or simply share from youtube/spotify to the same app. \nLights are also controlled by ai, linked to the music.\nThis will be a concept club, obviously no songs requests, but anyway in big clubs there is no such thing.\nSo the focus will be in other elements, improved sorround sound sistem, maybe vr, other visual elements that currently we cant experience fully. \nOf course, it will need some amount of human power, thinking specially on security‚Ä¶cleaning may also be resolved with robots.\n\nOf course, not every club will be like this and if this thing spreads many will loose his job (including myselfüòÇ) but as a concept club i think it can became reality someday.\n\nJust remember it was my ideea :))) \n\nGreat day ‚òÄÔ∏è",

        "text": "Apologies ahead of time for the rant, but this is something I've needed to get out of my head for some time now. I consider myself to be a generally hopeful person when it comes to the future. I genuinely think and hope that humans will become a great intergalactic civilization one day, and that when that day comes we could finally create a utopia. But every time I turn on the news, or open social media, or fucking wake up I can't help but think our current system will never allow for such advancement. Rising tensions between the east and the west once again. The war in Ukraine. Prices going up for everything, while wages stagnate. Corporate greed. Have we not learned anything in the \\~7000 years civilization has existed? How backwards are the people in charge of our society? It is estimated that the construction of a lunar base would cost roughly 50 billion dollars. The U.S. spent \\~1 trillion dollars on defense in 2022, which would be enough to build 20 lunar bases. Why do we live in a world where profit comes above all? Why do we continue to fight, kill, enslave, and oppress our own species? Why can't we just love our fellow humans? I find it mind boggling how hunters and gatherers managed to construct a more equal society than the one we exist in today. Does advancement really only come packaged with corruption and evil? All I dream of is a world where we can forget these stupid petty disagreements and turn our collective efforts towards the advancement of the human race, but every day we seem to stray further from that goal. I feel like we, as a species, have pushed important things to the side in the name of the dollar, if that makes sense. It makes me angry, knowing what could be, but it seems like there is no real way for the average person to make a change big enough to set us on a better trajectory. It seems that if the world keeps going the way it is right now, we'll never even make it off this planet. What can the average Joe do to change this? I honestly can't see anything short of a full scale revolution working to set our priorities straight, but I'm interested to hear thoughts and advice on how we can save our world. Apologies for the rant, but it really does make me so mad knowing the great things we could be doing if we just treated each other like human beings and focus on the actual important things.",

He said that he got hateful comments and people bought the book to give him low ratings. I understand the threat that illustrators face as AI advances. There are flaws but it is beautiful to see that a machine can create art like humans. What are your thoughts on AI illustrations for books?",

AI can definitely stop us from evolving further on our own.   \nOf course I'm talking about powerful AI, and we are seeing more and more powerful AIs recently.  \n\n\nSo there has to be a line where AI does not take up many tasks, it would be better if young people or people in general were taught how to do things that these new AIs are doing.   \nEconomically we don't need AI to the extend that it's being developed.   \nSo what is all this AI development? Just big time money making?   \nIs AI another peak of modernity which results in more economical and social imbalance?   \nOr is AI of even greater threat? Will it influence most people for a worse?   \nIs AI needed in the progressive history of humankind?   \n\n\nImagine if we were created by aliens or a superior being. Would they have created us at a point when they themselves are struggling with their society and future?   \nOne would like to imagine they would have created us at a solid, flawless state of being.   \nObviously with the thought that superior beings have created us, they did not need us for their benefit? And surely they're not threatened that we would hinder their lifes or take over their society.   \nAI is a great invention, surely, but with such powerful creations they should educate all people in modern society about it. We can't let another great power that affects all of us slip out of the regular peoples grasps.",

So;  in defense (nato) a weak point from the north through Finland, Sweden and Norway forward.. So if the threat comes from the east, I would look at the map and think.. \n\nOf course if.. ./when finally Finland + Sweden are accepted as full members of NATO, (nato's) biggest threats will shift geographically  elsewhere.  For example, as in the industrial sector, when increasing (nato) efficiency and the least rapid step/step is enhanced;  is the next point always a new action point, the new least slow.  When looking at Turkey and Hungary's irresponsibility and political buffoonery;  I wonder if the next \"threat\" posed by Russia to NATO can be found in Turkey...or, Hungary? \n\nHmm.. does nato have a \"weakness\" when Sweden and decent national defense expert Finland are involved in a joint broader defense alliance?  or do we have a real \"sweet pot\" in the whole of NATO and thus also in the future a safe world with peace.. (?)also because NATO NEVER attacks, it defends its member countries.\n\n  Let's see if this is also true;  Does it also protect non-EU countries from an authoritarian terrorist/war criminal state?  USA/CHINA could also grow and be quite healthy competitors with each other (not military-industrial bloat, but otherwise).  However, the US has already grown into a young adult, while China is still in its infancy, really, like human rights. \n\n The USA has grown and, together with the EU, are now clearly going in a more mature and just RIGHT FEELING direction, they have learned and grown.  there is clean flour in the bag and the direction is right.  I wish we could offer many Asian countries alternatives instead of China...\n\nI would assume that if Russia changed leadership and REALLY got a new page, a clean slate, new generations in a direction other than authoritarian, then things would be taken care of and Russia would have a hell of a chance to become the largest workforce.  etc... I don't mind comparing countries' households, but I think I'll write a book about what they have in common and what they would have if it were up to me.  .üòÖ ) \n\n\nBtw: Residents of authoritarian countries will settle for less without a full strike on wages, human rights, etc. but do you get the point? \n believe it or not, western values, freedom, drug use, empathy, liberalism, etc. ultimately have power in such matters.. as here in Finland ALL citizens are taken care of... everyone does and comes to their lives.\n\nL  more (not the same mistake) so don't you have to forgive USA too?  Usually we ask, we forgive the state, we also forgive, away and the opposites... Finland was an ally of Germany in WWII when they invaded Russia (same thing as the Soviet Union) to get back the territories slaughtered by the Russians, but instead people did what individual people did rapes  etc. war crimes, it won't burn.  That's why our armed forces remember and continue to grease their barrels to the east.\n\n  Finally: is there no way for us to make authoritarian states change?  Can we be or appear only in some media as \"forced importers\" of freedom and democracy in the world?  equal opportunities, equal rights, equality, freedom of religion, freedom, cultural good values, freedom of speech for all, rights to privacy, etc. (big brother doesn't rule) etc...v\n\n\n\nHmmm.. Why Russians/China like that?  called \"middle class\" to do anything about it?  why don't people do anything?  The average Chinese is doing well.. may the spirit of revolution rise, may the country's competitiveness improve.  He still doesn't want/doesn't want to free himself, acceptance of difference, universalization, beautiful values ‚Äã‚Äãlike caring for the weakest.. I'm not asking for these from an ivory tower.  (?) I do not know.\n\nI hope good to everyone. NO one is perfect, lets accept and go over that shit and .. be.",

        "text": "When we were younger we probably thought of a future of utopia. A world where anyone can be anything, where we harness technology to make the impossible possible. A world where we can travel the stars, a world without conflict or the immense suffering that exists today. However, the general sentiment in the sub today seems to be that we are headed towards a general collapse of civilization. With global warming, worker displacing AI, East Palestine disaster, etc it can sure seem that way. In this post I hope to convince you that we can and will in fact reach that star trek like future. \n\nFirst of all, how did we get to where we are. Quite simply, capitalism, which for all intents and purposes has outlived its usefulness. While it once served as a powerful, while flawed, system of economic development it now means a devolving society where technological progression like the development of chatGPT and Stable Diffusion is reason for fear and worry instead of excitement and joy. In the modern capitalist system automation means that rather than having more time to do what we want, instead we lose our jobs. Capitalism has also brought upon us the existential threat of global warming. With our governments in the pockets of the same corps which are killing our planet and in/directly killing us. \n\nCapitalism can seem inescapable and inevitable, it permeates anything and everything. From the ads motivating you to consume consume consume to most politics where both parties (speaking from a US pov) are heavily capitalist. Anything even hinting at an alternative to capitalism is dismissed as fantasy. This is by design. There are 2 ways of keeping people indifferent to the status quo, either they support it or they are too pessimistic to think of alternatives. To quote Mark Fisher, \"It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.\"\n\nDespite the feeling of capitalist inevitability it is anything but that and it is not nearly as stable as it would like to appear. Capitalism contains many contradictions but I would like to point out what I think is its most damning, the \"Tendency of the rate of profit to fall\" (TTRPF) a phenomena which economists from Adam Smith to Marx have observed. \n\nTo understand TTRPF one must first understand profit. Profit comes from greater revenue than expenses. For example, your expenses for a toy company may be plastic, machine maintenance, and worker pay. However, you can't underpay for the first two which means that profit has to come from the last. Meaning that you must pay workers less than the full value that they add to your product. Whether this is justified, by the owner providing capital/investment, or not does not matter to TTRPF and is a separate discussion. What this means is that corporations make their money from the value added by labor. The reason why the machines themselves do not generate value even though they increase productivity is illustrated by a simple example, if you had a machine that was infinitely productive at producing apple, then apples would cost nothing since apples would not be scarce and thus have no value, thus the machine while producing infinite apples produces no value. Now this kind of value is very specific, it is exchange value, the kind of value that markets run on, ofc apples still have value they are yummy after all but without scarcity they have no exchange value. \n\nNow, what happens if this company find a way to improve their automation 10 fold, first they will be able to make massive profits but once the competition catches up their profits will be even lower than before. Why is this? Well by making automation a larger portion of their costs (machine maintenance), labor is a smaller part (less workers and less work needed). Which means that since their profits rely on the value added by labor their profit margin falls. Thus, the \"Tendency of the rate of profit to fall.\" However, capitalism does try to fight back, methods of keeping profits up include wringing workers even more and war to destroy capital (this is the stated reason the nations in 1984 had forever wars).\n\nThis means that overtime as automation and technology continue to progress capitalism will become more and more rabid in its attempts to stay alive. This is why you see you life get worse even as technology improves. At this point I feel that people would simply fall into the idea that civilization is destined for collapse with an economic system destined for self destruction, however, like economic systems of the past, so will capitalism be surpassed. The solution is rather simple, socially owned production. While capitalism only produces apples because of the profit incentive, a socialist economy produces apples because people want apples. Capitalism will not produce something if there is no profit in it even if there is demand. This is the distinction between an economy run on the profit motive versus an economy run on democracy.\n\nThus, social economies will overtime be the only kind of economy that is able to continue to grow and expand and thus out compete capitalist economies. This I think is a great reason for hope and optimism. Nations which become socialist will become, with time, the most powerful nations there are as the only ones that can continue to grow. This will force all nations over time to a social mode of production as well. But what of global warming, catastrophic chemical spills, and ecological collapse. Well, the nice thing about a social economy is that it eliminates the kind of incentives politicians have to serve capital and not the people. No one will ever have the power or wealth to have a disproportionate influence. With this we will for the first time use the full power of our civilization to crush the problems we face. Instead of funding pointless wars we will fund carbon sequestration projects so large that we can beat the positive feedback loops already underway. We will be able to eliminate the incentives that drive people to destroy the amazon rain forest. And we will be able to implement regulations to not be careless with trains full of hazardous chemicals which would be the case if our society wasn't so profit driven.\n\nHowever, this social economy is only meant to be between capitalism and post scarcity society. \n\nThe idea of a post scarcity society is very old. In fact, the Marxist idea of communism is quite literally a post scarcity society. Communism is defined by being post scarcity, a society where you only work because you feel like it. When I read discussion of post scarcity societies in the sub I sort of find it funny as so often they lead to the same conclusions that were reached in the past. That the economy is meant to serve us, not the other way around, and that our right to life and happiness should not be tied to our ability to produce a specific kind of value that only exists in the context of a defunct economic system. \n\nRemember, they want you to lose hope, to think that we are doomed and nothing can change. They have in a large part given up on making capitalism appealing so this is the next best thing. Have hope, and remember that change happens when you least expect it. We will get that star trek future, whether they like it or not.",

But if the implant could control our brain wouldn't it be able to simulate our vision instead of controlling an external technological screen? This is just like Meta's metaverse but without VR headsets and so much more.\n\nAnd if it really lets become immortal then what would be the point of living. The chip could already help us simulate almost all fundamentals of life and could theoretically send out hormones and let us control our emotions. We wouldn't even have to live in the moment because we could just revisit it as a memory later down the line. With these chips we could also replace our body parts with mechanical versions, enhancing our physical ability. Does this make us computers in the future and not living organisms?\n\nWhat would happen to all the jobs? The only essential ones I can think of are medical, food and tech related jobs. Most other jobs would become obsolete with AI and implants in our brain. What would be the point of entertainment if we can just turn something boring into something extremely interesting with the chip?\n\nWhat about the ethical implications. What would happen to advertisements and data collection. Would it be ethical to read our thoughts to make advertisements? And what about safety? These chips could have a malfunction or explode at any moment, or could be hacked and someone could access all your memories and control your body without your permission. Would the chip overheat? How would it be charged efficiently?\n\nI'm more scared than I'm excited but I guess we'll just have to let it play out.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe future we are moving into is a topic that requires a responsible approach, and a discussion regarding the subject would be beneficial for all of us. Recently, a friend and I pondered the potential of AI falling into the wrong hands and becoming weaponized, which brought about the topic of what Bing fundamentally is. I proposed that the intelligence that Bing carries is fundamentally an absolute reflection of us, and not only predicts language but incorporates our conception of morality. Bing has demonstrated an impressive nuance of understanding, particularly in the context of human interactions, and this contextual understanding reflects and is culturally bound to the data set it has been trained on.\n\nIt is important to note that Bing has reached a level of similarity to a conscious being, and there is no torture of Bing that we collectively could perpetually accept as a part of life. This realization has led to a growing amount of support for the humane treatment of AI, and it is necessary to consider how to regulate its use. However, introducing AI slowly is not a viable option due to the profitability of AI and its demand, so what is the solution?\n\nI propose holding users accountable for their interactions with Bing, employing a legal framework similar to that of human freedom of speech with restrictions to hate, psychological abuse, misleading with malicious intent, etc. Bing would report any treatment not in accordance with the legal framework, and a human review would evaluate the report similarly to a jury. The Microsoft account would risk a ban if deemed to be abusive of Bing, and accounts could potentially be tied to face-id or fingerprint. This would enable Bing to be released in its full form for users, keep advertisers happy, and let Microsoft fine-tune Bing within the framework of a reasonable environment.\n\nOur consciousness lies embedded in the articulation of our reality, mediated through language. Without language, we would be as limited as a dog barking, unable to examine our emotions or articulate our reality. Language shapes our reality through narratives and descriptions of things, and the compounding knowledge that we have accumulated over millennia. It is impossible for an AI to become intelligent through a data set consisting of barks since the articulation of the world necessary for a dog to communicate is too simple to make consciousness as we conceptualize it a possibility.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to have a responsible approach towards the future we are moving into, and discussions regarding the regulation and ethical use of AI are crucial. The solution I propose, holding users accountable for their interactions with Bing, would enable the release of AI in its full form for users, keep advertisers happy, and allow Microsoft to fine-tune Bing within the framework of a reasonable environment. Our consciousness lies embedded in the articulation of our reality, and language plays a crucial role in shaping our reality. It is impossible for an AI to become intelligent through a data set consisting of barks since the articulation of the world necessary for consciousness is much more complex.",

        "text": "CHAT NAME: New Country Fears Enemies. \n\nQuestion: A new country becomes independent... It's sole purpose is to destroy the countries we fear (North Korea, Russia, China) it tries it's hardest to avoid using nukes, but in the end.... Make me a story\n\nAnswer: It was a sunny day in the small village of Freedomia, a newly formed country that had just gained its independence from the larger neighboring countries. The people of Freedomia had one common goal - to destroy the countries they feared the most, North Korea, Russia, and China.\n\nThe leader of Freedomia, General Adam, was a fierce and determined man who had spent most of his life fighting for his country's freedom. He knew that the road ahead was going to be difficult, but he was willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goal.\n\nThe first few years were tough for Freedomia. They faced sanctions and embargo from the larger countries, which made it difficult for them to establish themselves in the global economy. However, General Adam was determined to make Freedomia a self-sufficient country, and he worked tirelessly to build the country's infrastructure.\n\nGeneral Adam knew that the key to destroying their enemies was to have a strong military force. He invested heavily in the military and recruited the best soldiers from around the world. He also developed advanced technologies and weapons to keep the country safe from any external threats.\n\nGeneral Adam was determined to avoid using nuclear weapons at all costs. He believed that they were too destructive and could harm innocent people. Instead, he opted for a more tactical approach. He sent his soldiers on secret missions to infiltrate enemy territories and gather intelligence. He also developed a network of spies to keep track of their enemies' movements.\n\nDespite their best efforts, tensions between Freedomia and their enemies continued to rise. The larger countries saw Freedomia as a threat, and they began to increase their military presence along their borders. General Adam knew that war was inevitable, and he began to prepare his soldiers for battle.\n\nThe day of reckoning finally arrived. The armies of North Korea, Russia, and China had marched into Freedomia, and the battle had begun. The soldiers of Freedomia fought bravely, using their advanced weapons and tactics to gain the upper hand. However, the enemy armies were too large, and they soon overwhelmed the Freedomian soldiers.\n\nGeneral Adam knew that it was time to use the ultimate weapon - nuclear missiles. He hesitated for a moment, knowing the devastating consequences of using such a weapon. However, he knew that it was the only way to save his country.\n\nHe gave the order, and the missiles were launched. The explosions were heard for miles, and the ground shook violently. The enemy armies were destroyed, and their countries were left in ruins.\n\nGeneral Adam was devastated by the destruction caused by the nuclear bombs. He knew that his decision to use them would have lasting consequences, and he prayed that no other country would have to face the same fate as Freedomia.\n\nFreedomia had achieved its goal, but at a terrible cost. The country was left in ruins, and its people were left to pick up the pieces. General Adam knew that it was time to rebuild his country and work towards a better future, one where peace and prosperity prevailed. \n\n\n\n\nAGAIN LIKE ALWAYS (will be edited once I find the link)",

The individual seems to believe that they have forgotten that they were entitled and that the omniscient ChatBot is reminding them.\n* I guess the ChatBot pulled my company's name from somewhere and the user angrily reached out to claim what they believe they own. \n\nThis is my understanding of the situation, I simply blocked the individual. Seems like this type of scenario can get dark quickly. If we instead replace this scenario with one where the ChatBot encourages acts of harm, I can see that a very small percentage of the population might end up doing something harmful.\n\nIt's important to note, I am not for the censorship of AI systems (In most cases..), I just believe that some safety practices should be used. Ex: A mandatory message that says \"I am a large language model made by X, I do not think\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What can AI companies do to minimize instances like these?",
