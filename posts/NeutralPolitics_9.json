        "text": "This morning it was announced that Kim Jung-Un would commit to [\"complete denuclearization\"](https://nypost.com/2018/06/12/kim-jong-un-commits-to-complete-denuclearization-of-the-korean-peninsula-document/) as part of a joint-document he signed with Donald Trump. In return, the United States would halt [joint-military exercises with South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html). It should be mentioned that Kim had [already pledged denuclearization](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/27/606264786/peace-at-hand-korean-leaders-meet-for-historic-border-handshake) back in April with a meeting with South Korea's leader.\n\nAs a result, many people have pointed out that historically, [Kim has made similar pledges but backed out on them.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/asia/north-korean-denuclearization-promises/index.html) \n\nI have several questions as it relates to this summit.\n\n1) What makes this pledge from Kim different from previous pledges?\n\n2) If Kim backs out on his pledge, and we no longer have troops in South Korea, what are our options from a geopolitical standpoint?\n\n3) Is the document signed by Kim and Trump a document of substance, or a document for the media? Is there anything binding in that document that holds each nation to it's pledges?",

The one supplier in whom I have complete confidence is Canada. Not only do we currently have a steel surplus with Canada, but we share a border and have synergistic strategic, economic, and national security interests. However, treating Canada as a unique partner under any Section 232 relief measures requires that Canada also strengthen and align its trade enforcement efforts with ours. [Appendix F, p.60]\n\nThis seems to indicate Canada and the United States share a special relationship in regards to trade, and steel specifically, and also seems to weaken the argument (while not entirely) that Canada is a threat to U.S. national security of steel production.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThese broad arguments for and against understanding Canada as a threat to U.S. steel production all come from the Commerce Department, and quite frankly they are a bit confusing.  Including additional domestic and foreign reports/sources, what are the arguments for and against Canada being a threat to U.S. steel production? \n\n---- This question is very limited - I do not want to raise the significantly more complicated question of whether this is good idea for *the overall relationship* between the U.S. and Canada. This already seems to be very much in the public discussion, and I think in this case will side track from the question.\n",

[In those letters](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/trump-pardon-power-constitution.html), he could possibly be referring to his lawyers' arguments that the executive branch could not obstruct justice and could shut down any investigation the POTUS chooses. Still, this wouldn't answer what is unconstitutional about the special counsel investigation, and is more oriented towards executive power and privilege. \n\n&gt; The comments by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani about the legal limits of presidential power follow a report in The New York Times that the president’s lawyers had written a 20-page memorandum in January arguing that Mr. Trump could “if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon.”\n\n&gt; In the memo, sent to Mr. Mueller’s office in January, Mr. Trump’s legal team said that the president could not, by definition, illegally obstruct any part of the Russia investigation because the Constitution gave him the power to end it in the first place.\n\n[Lawyer Alan Dershowitz has argued that Michael Cohen](http://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/382459-dershowitz-targeting-trumps-lawyer-should-worry-us-all), and by connection Trump's, constitutional rights may have been violated during the raid on Cohen's homes and office. This too is a far cry from stating the special counsel investigation is unconstitutional.\n\nAside from these tangential arguments on the constitutionality of executive powers and a specific action taken on Cohen, what is the possible basis for Trump stating the special counsel investigation is unconstitutional?

For example, [the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44324565) say that \"Analysts at IHS Markit expected the effects to be distributed across a wide range of markets, limiting the effect on steel prices outside the US. That leaves America to bear the brunt of the economic impact.\"\n\nSome steel companies in Canada are American-owned, so there is perhaps an argument that America is shooting itself in the foot by harming American companies. \n\nThe thought occurs to me, though, that with regards to those steel companies in Canada who have American ownership (I'm not sure what percentage of companies this might relate to), it is the American corporations, not the American people, who will suffer. The staff employed by these companies will be mostly Canadian since they are physically located in Canada.\n\nA similar argument can be made with regards to Brexit.

But again, this is something that will affect corporations such as banks, more than individuals.\n\nSo, the question:\n\n**When actions are taken which \"harm the economy\" is it generally true that they harm large portions of the citizenry of the country, or are effects more concentrated among specific industries and individual?** Please feel free to use either Trump's policies or Brexit as examples, but if possible, please don't limit yourself only to those scenarios.",

There are fines associated with violations of these rules.\n\nPolitical protest is a [Constitutionally guaranteed right in the US,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) but many [legal experts support the view](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/25/16360580/nfl-donald-trump-national-anthem-protest) that the NFL, as a private organization, may set its own workplace rules, even if they limit expression. \n\nOn the other hand, there are some interesting counterarguments.\n\n&gt; Last month, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled in *Beckman v. Chicago Bear Football Club* that a Green Bay Packers fan [may proceed with his First Amendment lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2018/05/02/recent-court-decision-makes-it-riskier-for-nfl-teams-to-punish-protesting-players/#354cee8948d8) against the Chicago Bears organization after the Bears refused to allow him to attend an on-field event while dressed in Packers clothing. The court noted that the fan may have a right to \"free speech\" within Soldier Field based on an operating agreement that gave both the Chicago Bears football club and the Chicago Park District shared control over speech in the **publicly-funded football stadium.** (emphasis added)\n\n[Many NFL stadiums are publicly funded.](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-new-stadiums-public-funding-how-much-atlanta-san-diego-minnesota-los-angeles-033116)\n\nAnd Benjamin Sachs, a Harvard professor of labor and industry, [calls the ban \"flatly illegal\"](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/25/17394422/nfl-knee-kneeling-labor-law-kaepernick-free-speech-protest-owners) on a number of different grounds, including the league's failure to discuss the new rules with the player's union before changing the terms of employment, the restriction it imposes on the employees' right to engage in a collective action, and the limitations it introduces on protected free speech, based on either State constitutions, or Federally, because of the involvement of the US President in the dispute.\n\nSo, the first question is, based on the above, whether the NFL's new policy is legal.\n\nMoving beyond that, is the ban an appropriate measure for the league to take? President Trump expressed his support for the rule and strongly implied that it didn't go far enough:\n\n&gt; I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or\nyou shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.\n\nOthers argue that in the US, [the act of protest itself is patriotic.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-anthem-nfl-protest-patriotism-20180524-story.html) Is there room for dissent over policy at a public event put on by a private organization?\n\nAnd finally, if the NFL's new policy isn't the right one, what would be better? Have alternative approaches been proposed that would allow the league to respond to the desires of its fans while also honoring the laws and traditions of the country?\n\n-------\n\nThanks to /u/715d for the idea for this post and /u/DenotedNote for composing the first draft.\n",
