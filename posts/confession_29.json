        "text": "I‚Äôve been with him since we were kids, we have been together more than a decade. \n\nAnd he keeps betraying me. First it was real cheating, Snapchat, making plans to meet up. And I found out, he apologized. I figured it was me who wasn‚Äôt enough, me who didn‚Äôt do enough, perform enough. \n\nHe‚Äôs my best friend and besides this one thing he is perfect. He‚Äôs so perfect- but this morning I found that he has been paying three dollars for cam girls on adult friend finder, multiple charges throughout the years. But he got mad at me, for betraying his trust and looking at his phone. He says it‚Äôs no different than porn, and that he feels like he has no privacy. Which is true, I shouldn‚Äôt go through his phone. But he‚Äôs been actively watching people that I will NEVER look like. No matter how much i fast or workout or anything. He claims he loves my body and then he pays to watch women who are stick skinny. Not ‚Äúcurvy‚Äù or whatever you want to call me. Just say it, I‚Äôm fat and not attractive \n\nHe stills has sex with me, multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times in a day \n\nHe says he‚Äôs not talking to anyone so what‚Äôs the issue with cam girls? He said he‚Äôs allowed to have privacy and basically he can‚Äôt trust ME. \n\nI‚Äôve never cheated, I‚Äôve never done anything wrong (in regards to this) \n\nI‚Äôve just been apologizing saying he‚Äôs right. He does have a right to privacy and a night life. I just- if he doesn‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs so upsetting to me should I even try to get him to understand? Every time this happens I just end up consoling him and then crying in the bathroom by myself, because I know him seeing me upset would make him upset \n\nMaybe I really do deserve this. I‚Äôm pathetic. I care about his feelings so much, I love him so much I will willingly destroy myself. My fatal flaw is loyalty even if I‚Äôm literally being stabbed in the back. He protected me for so long I can‚Äôt seem to be mad at him for long and then I try to forget it. Lock it in a little box far away from myself\n\n\nHe‚Äôs unhappy I brought this up, he‚Äôs been having bad weekends, bad days in general and when I brought this up he said ‚Äúwell back to a miserable weekend, back to everyday being miserable‚Äù so I realized I had to just drop it and get over it \n\nI just wish he would get jealous. He would find it hot if I hooked up with someone else- he‚Äôs asked me too and before this I was even willing and excited. Now the idea of being touched by anyone makes my skin sweat and twitch and I feel pretty disgusted \n\nI want him to love me as much as I love him, but I don‚Äôt think he does. I think he‚Äôs loves me with his entire heart but maybe our loves are just different. Maybe because he doesn‚Äôt get jealous he doesn‚Äôt understand\n\nI just needed to vent.",

I'd be walking down the street and see a package, and if the surroundings were right I'd make my move. \n\nBut now it's something I seriously can't stop doing. I spend nearly all of my free time driving or walking around my town and scouting out potential packages to steal. \n\nI've never shoplifted, never robbed anyone, never stolen from a friend or family member. There's just something about the thrill of stealing an unmarked package that I seriously can't stop doing. It's like christmas morning every time I open one\n\nMost of the time it's complete junk to me. I've stolen tupperware sets, clothes that aren't my style, medications (I feel extreme guilt every time that's happened), but the few major scores I've made are what keep me doing it. I've gotten an ipad, computer parts, and several pairs of airpods. \n\nIt's taking a major toll on me because I feel like such a piece of shit for it but I really can't stop. I'm thinking about going to therapy or something but I'm afraid of getting in legal trouble",

Still there are times where I feel alone, because not everyone can understand this.\nDo you guys share any similar experiences? Do let me know I might find something that'll help me in future.",

        "text": "\nWhen I was 15 I was very insecure and lonely. I did have friends, and they were nice too, but it was always clear that I was an afterthought. Sometimes they'd include me last minute for things they planned in advance, they'd often say \"the 4 of us\" when we were with 5, they had lots of inside jokes I wasn't part of, etc. Do not get me wrong, they were always very lovely and I never got the impression that they were mean to me behind my back, but it always felt like they had to actively remember I was there. Fed up with feeling lonely, I decided to search for a friend on my own.\n\nAt first I contacted an old friend of mine. We had pretty similar interests, personalities, and he also gave of the semi-lonely vibe so I figured why not? It took us almost a year to become good friends but after that we really hit it off and I'd call him my current bestfriend. Looking back, it's kinda weird things even worked out because reading old messages, I was borderline harrassing him. Even though I had him, I wasn't satisfied after a while. I liked my friend but I wanted a group of friends to feel at home with. Thus started one of the weirdest periods in my life where I was just \"recruiting\" people in the weirdest ways?\n\nThe first one was an old elementary school classmate of mine. I stalked his social media and realised that we had grown to become pretty similar in terms of fashion and music taste. To have an excuse to meet up, I sent him a message asking him if he would be down to be interviewed for a school project regarding the atmosphere in my former classrooms. The twist? The project didn't even exist, I made it all up. During the \"interview\" I dropped some hints regarding things I knew he liked and from there we kicked things off. I've never told him it was a fake interview and as far as he's concerned, it's still true to this day.\n\nThe second one was someone from my school who regularly sat alone. I stumbled upon his art account and he often drew characters from shows I liked so I had to become friends with him. Instead of approaching him, like a normal human being would, I put myself in situations where I'd \"coincidentally\" have a reason to talk to him. Eventually it worked out though.\n\nNext one was also someone from my school and she is someone I surprisingly just met pretty normally! She was the new girl in class and things clicked between us.\n\nLast one was this girl that worked at my part-time job. The problem was that I worked every Saturday and sometimes during the breaks, meanwhile I had no idea what her schedule was. So what did 16 year old me do? I casually asked my boss to change my schedule to match hers. It was terrible. Got me working on some random Tuesdays after school. Looking back, he probably thought I had a crush on her and wanted to help me out but I'm still shocked he didn't find my request strange. From there I asked her to hang out outside of work sometimes and boom.\n\nFrom there I stragetically introduced everyone to eachother 1 by 1 and eventually the group kinda took shape. I love them with all my heart and these people are some of the best things that have ever happened to me. They're the most loving, supportive, awesome, and funniest friend group I've ever had. Sadly I still have some underlying guilt since I kind of deceived most of them. It especially hits me when one of them says something along the lines of: \"Isn't it crazy we all ended up together?\". Because I know it isn't a coincidence. But I can't just reply: \"Actually, I harrassed, set up fake interviews, stalked, and manipulated y'all to be my friends. Oh, almost forgot to mention I made literal mindmaps on how to introduce y'all to eachother to optimize the chances of creating this group. üòÅ\"\n\nOther times I feel like I give myself too much credit, because if they didn't vibe with eachother this group wouldn't have existed anyway. I could try to force it as much as I want but to make it last they obviously need to like eachother. Either way, this guilt-feeling eats me up inside and even though this has been about 6-7 years ago, I wish I had approached things differently.",
