        "text": "Two stars collide. Obviously we have a huge outpouring of energy. My question here is, assuming there is sufficient mass between the two stars, would we have a black hole, or does that REQUIRE a fusion of heavier elements first? And if there is no black hole, then would we end up with, later on down the line, a new star that is at least a little larger than either of the original two? Also, how much energy are we looking at? GRB?\n\nNext question: What would it take to move a star? Steer one someplace else. Obviously we can't strap a rocket to the sun, so how might a star be induced to alter its course?\n\nOne more for the road: So we'll assume the answer to my previous question is, in brief, no. In that scenario, moving a planet. I came up with an idea myself involving engines on a large enough rock and coaxing it into an orbit that, with continued guidance and boosts from the engines, would essentially tow the planet away. I envision this working better with a moon as part of the equation, as it'd be easier to sustain the \"dance\" required to keep shooting one out far enough to pull the others. My issue with this is tidal forces. Would there be a \"goldilocks zone\" in which you could pull this off without shattering all the bodies involved or otherwise causing massive destruction on the surface of the world/s in question?\n\nThanks in advance, folks.",

        "text": "Hey all. I just finished visiting the second of the two schools which have accepted me into their PhD programs, and after seeing both, I think my choice has been boiled down to one question which regards my future career prospects. I intend to place extra effort into developing my teaching skills in grad school so that I can eventually go for a faculty position in the future, preferably at a liberal arts school. I'm aware of how difficult this plan will be, especially with more and more students looking to do the same thing and competing for very few positions. Right now though I'm focusing on the first step - where do I go?\n\nThere are separate benefits to each of the two schools which I am considering. One school is a great standalone astronomy program with plenty of interesting research groups to which I'd be delighted to contribute, while the other is a decent joint physics and astronomy program featuring a seriously world class instrumentalist. So my question boils down to a choice between doing regular astrophysics or doing more of an instrumentation focus. The first school has instrumentation as well but not to the degree and level of regard at which this particular professor is working at the second school. Likewise, I'd do some degree of astronomy research under the instrumentalist at the second school, but not to the depth I would under a regular astronomy-oriented advisor.\n\nUltimately, which skill set will be more marketable for a future faculty position? I know that to continue as an instrumentalist after my PhD will require massive funding (which this professor at the second school certainly has) and so it is unlikely that I will continue that degree of research at a teaching institution, but I could potentially involve undergrads in simple instrument building or teach electronics as well as astronomy. However, my graduate level \"science\" would not be as in-depth as someone who did pure astronomy research. On the other hand, there are a lot more people doing pure astronomy for their degrees than there are choosing an instrumentation focus, so it could make me unique. Both programs have excellent opportunities for collaboration and making connections. \n\nThank you to anyone who read this whole wall. Does anyone have any advice for pros and cons between the two options?",

In all honesty, I have no one I could talk to about career options nor my passion in astronomy, and I believe that this is the only place that gathers intelligent astronomy-enthusiasts and even people who are in the field of space who have a lot of useful knowledge that can be extremely helpful to people like me.~~\n\nI'm a 16 year old boy and my college applications were due today.\nI have applied to Health Science for college, which is a two year pre-university program. I did it for my passion in chemistry and science, not because I want to be a doctor. This degree will allow me, in university, to do anything relating to medicine, engineering, science, astronomy, mechanics, biology, etc.\n\nI have always loved math and science, but recently math has been getting tough for me and I have been falling behind, but over a year I have gotten very passionate about astronomy and space, and have binge-watched every single YouTube video with Neil Degrasse Tyson in it, whether it be Bill Maher, Kimmel, Fallon, or any single thing on StarTalk Radio. I convinced my parents to buy me a telescope for Christmas last year and have observed the moon and Jupiter countless nights, the sight making me amazed each and every single time. I am obsessed with space and science, but I feel like I will never be able to accomplish anything and become an astronomer/astrophysicist as I feel I am only average and not a genius like Neil or Sagan or any of those exchange students in my math class who easily receive 90s and 100s, as I struggle to get my 80s and 90s.\n\nCan someone please let me know if I could realistically have any success in this career path. Or am I wasting my time and should stick to something safer like medicine, engineering, etc? The only people I generally see that are in Astronomy professions are geniuses and people who are considered gifted. Because in all honesty, I feel like I am not a genius nor extremely smart, but there is NOTHING I love more than space and astronomy..\n\nEdit: Down to 0 points. I sense butt-hurt people. Thank you to all of those who took the time to share their experiences. I love all the replies and have learned something from each and every one of them. Thank you.",

I am curious on how the planets gravity would behave at the intersection both planets, how atmosphere and tides would work, and how life would behave at the high and low spots on the planets.

Plus, finding things which don't give off light (like black holes for instance) would be easier, as we would look for gravity, rather than light.\n\nI just want to fully understand and appreciate just how important a find this is.

I'm guessing that the center is only considered a zero-g environment in relation to the celestial body and not the space/gravity itself? Even if you float in the middle of a planet, you are still affected by the sun, etc. so you can't be experiencing zero-g, right?\n\n-\n\nIf that is true, is the following link wrong?

But I digress. Back to the real question. This might be a better question for /r/geology, but I'm going to ask you AND them anyways:\n\nIs it possible for a planet to have a mountain peak so tall that it reaches the planet's atmosphere and actually summits quite a ways into space?\n\nIf so, what effects would that have on the planet? \nOn the mountain? \nOn the orbit?\nOr anything I might not be considering?\n\nI appreciate any and all help you can give me with this little question of mine. I am going to be resorting to this sub Reddit quite a bit to finish this novel, so if any of you are interested in helping me please send me a private message because I would love to have a professional on hand that I could run ideas by to keep this novel as scientifically believable as possible (my background is in microbiology and biotechnology not astrophysics). Anybody who contributes a decent amount will be mentioned by name (or username whatever you prefer) in my finished book when it is published. I realize that this is not much of a reward, but isn't teaching a reward in itself? LOL Thanks guys. I look forward to any conversations we might have about these ideas.

        "text": "Hi everybody,\n\nI hope some of you have worked with pulsars before or other x-ray data from NASA Heasarc. I need some data showing a very precise light curve of the crab pulsar and some other pulsar. You should be able to see the individual pulses over time.\nIt should be something like this: \nhttp://cdn.eso.org/images/screen/eso9948i.jpg \nWhere the time is in milliseconds ranging to 200 ms.\nOr something like this: http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/Education/Sounds/0531_seq.mp4 \nThe goal is to see the individual pulses, but hopefully in x-rays instead.\n\nThen i should get a related power spectrum to the data, where i can determine the period/which frequency the pulsar pulsates. Something like this graph: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6691/images/394344aa.tif.0.gif I know these data i linked are unrelated, it's just to get an idea of what i'm looking for.\n\nI'm quite unexperienced with the software related to HEASARC and i'm not very familiar with their data archive or different kind telescopes. I have installed the HEASOFT package. But since it is a jungle out there, i hoped some of you could help telling me what to do.\n\nWhich telescope is capable of measuring so precise, that you can graph the individual pulses on a graph, like with the crab pulsar, which pulsates around 30 times a second. Is it the RXTE? \nWhere should i find the data in the HEASARC archive, and what files should i look for? Specially if i want to graph a light curve of a pulsar showing the individual pulses.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's pre-processed or fully processed data. I should just be able to determine the pulse period, the change in pulse period (dp), and knowing which telescope and what software used to data processing. \nOff course i should be able to show the graphs too, and i should know which year/date the data was measured. But if i can make some of the data processing myself it would be preferably.\n\nOr is there no telescope which measure that precise, when it comes to x-ray data, and should i instead be looking for data in the radiowaves.",

Rapper B.o.B. has stepped into the astrophysics discourse with some controversial statements in favor of Flat Earth Theory. Our boy Neil, predictably, stepped in with a quick takedown of B.o.B.'s passionate views. B.o.B. later responded with a brand-new informational music track, in which he bolsters his providing additional evidence for his prior claims, in addition to some choice personal allegations against Neil himself.\n\nWhere do we stand on all this? Obviously, Neil is a heavy-hitter in the science community, but should we count the new guy out? Many of history's greatest scientists, from Galileo to Newton, were persecuted and ridiculed for daring to introduce bold new ideas. Maybe we shouldn't be so quick to throw another young, rebellious scientist on the proverbial cross.",
