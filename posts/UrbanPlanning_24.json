        "text": "In most cites they are building light rail or BRT instead of  Heavy Rail, and the thought is you get more bang for you buck.\n\nHowever, the main cost savings seems to be you can cut corners that make rapid transit rapid in the former two and not in the latter.\n\nLets take the Silver Line Expansion in Boston/Chelsea for example. Although it has large stretches of exclusive busways, it does cross a few intersections and more importantly when crossing Chelsea Creek, it crosses on a mix trafficked draw bridge, and Crosses Boston Harbor in the I-90 Ted Williams Tunnel. Now those two pinch points of the Transportation network are the most important areas to have an exclusive ROW because they are generally the areas with the most delays. \n\nBRT allows you to cut out the most expensive design elements, and still call it BRT, while Heavy Rail forces exclusive ROW. If you built a BRT line like the Silver Line with heavy rail ROW guidelines, the cost probably would have been very similar.\n\nSame thing with most LRT systems in America, they have exclusive ROW where its easy, and there is little traffic (eg. DART along old Railbeds) and mix with traffic were its Hard, like downtown Dallas. This isn't an inherent advantage of Light rail to be cheaper than heavy rail, its basically not paying for something you are not getting. Light Rail can be as functionally efficient as heavy rail, and in place like Charlotte or Dallas if they ever build a \"subway\" line it would probably be wise for it to be light rail because it would make upkeep easier. \n\nPeople do harp on how BRT and light Rail technically have lower capacities than HRT. For the most part though cities aren't going to reach even LRT capacity levels. Boston's Green Line has more ridership than most light rail systems. Charlottes Blue Line's ridership could fit on a normal Bus route. \n\nIts not capacity, or anything inherent in the different mode, its design and how BRT and LRT allow corners to be cut and HRT doesn't that makes HRT more expensive. Good BRT or LRT can function just as well as HRT unless you are in some mega city like NYC or London where ridership will actually push capacity of the other systems.\n",

After I suggested a system similar to the English countryside or Portland, they felt it would maintain small town feelings that are very important to natives and help keep local governments from sacrificing the interests of their citizens to the veritable gods of \"bringing in businesses\" and tax revenue. \n\nHas anyone found effective ways of discussing growth boundaries without being accused of socialism/communism/etc.?",

        "text": "Hey there all. I'm based in the UK and although I'm not a planner, I use my bike a lot to get around. So I feel strongly that cycle infrastructure should be safe and effective.\n\nRecently in my local area there's been issues with the only totally traffic free cycle route we have: the Greenway. It was meant as a cycle path but is technically a 'shared space', meaning it's also for pedestrians, horses, dog walkers, you name it. Shared spaces are the default solution to the lack of bike paths in the UK, and involve lumping cyclists with pedestrians and everything that's not a car either on traffic free paths or on wide pavements. \n\nAnyway, back to the Greenway - it is a nice place to go for many different things. The problem is that cyclists want to go faster than walkers to get where they need to go efficiently. Unfortunately these differences in speed have led to walkers getting injured recently. So, Sustrans (a charity promoting sustainable transport, known for liking shared spaces) has put in chicanes to slow cyclists down.\n\nThis has been controversial. Two webpages neatly summarise the opposing arguments regarding these chicanes - the Sustrans statement on the matter, and a petition against it. \n\nThe statement: https://www.sustrans.org.uk/news/sustrans-statement-chester-greenway\n\nThe petition: https://www.change.org/p/cheshire-west-and-chester-council-stop-barriers-on-chester-millennium-greenway\n\nSo I guess I wanted to start a discussion here to see what planners think about this problem with 'shared space' policies. Furthermore, do you think chicanes are the right solution, and if not - what would you do?\n\nEdit: formatting ",

I expected more entries with this amount of upvotes, so I will give it a bit more time.**\n\nThis is supossed to be a casual little contest for people to learn and to exchange ideas with people from all over the world. There is nothing to win except bragging rights.\n\nI have spoken with the mods and they are fine with this.\n\n**+++ Scenario +++**\n\nYour task is to create a concept plan for a new (and imaginary) flat island 25 km north of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. 100,000 people are supposed to live there. And you get to decide how they live.\n\nJust south of [Hoorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoorn) this circular island, 8 km in diameter (area of  50.264 km²) will nest in a bay of the [Markermeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markermeer) lake. It will lie at a distance of 1 km to the current shore line. [Like this](https://imgur.com/3kSkNJb). The dutch are really good at reclaiming land, so you need to have a concept ready on Wednesday morning.\n\nYou can take away land from your island, but you can not add land to it.\n\nThe dutch have done this in real life on a much larger scale with [Flevoland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland).\n\n**+++ How to enter +++**\n\n1. Enter by replying to the \"ENTER HERE\" comment in this thread and place a link to an imgur album there. The album can be empty at first. People are free to comment on your entry during the contest.\n2. You fill the album with images. All images must be watermarked ([simlilar to this](https://imgur.com/3kSkNJb)), this is to ensure that the work of those participated is not exploited by others. Submissions without a watermark will not be considered. If anything else not concerning the contest is present, offensive materials are presented or the album is empty on Wednesday your entry gets barred.\n3. On Wednesday a voting thread will be opened. I will create a reply in this thread for every entry - stating contestant name and linking to the imgur album. People can up- or downvote this reply.\n\n**+++ Details +++**\n\nYour plan should be detailed enough to get a good understanding of your idea. How much more detail you add is up to you. Your presentation does not have to be professional looking - this is supposed to be a casual fun thing.\n\nIf you name your island, add a flag and include an explanation text it would probably help your submission.\n\nMaybe a rought calculation on how you get to 100,000 people would help - with your areas and densities and floor area ratios and so on.\n\n**+++ Planning Help +++**\n\n[Area on google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.6055718,4.9786598,11.46z)\n\n[Wikipedia article on population density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density)\n\nIf you like you can download a zip with a DXF File (DXF 15) and satellite image (from Google Earth).

        "text": "How do food deserts happen and what makes them sustained in inner cities?  I understand big box stores like Costco or Sam's Club not seeing a big enough market to support themselves in impoverished inner cities, but stores like Kroger's or Meijer's don't seem to target a particularly affluent market (I say this as someone who gets the majority of his food from Krogers), so why aren't there more low cost supermarkets in poorer areas?\n\nAre grocery stores uniquely vulnerable to theft or robbery due to their packaged items or open layout compared to liquor stores, fast food places, and \"cash for gold\" shops?  Is there more cost associated with running a store than what it seems on the surface?  \n\nAnd why don't cities that experience food deserts help the situations by offering tax grants for grocery stores and other daily used shops that can improve the quality of life for their citizens?  The tax grants seem to be available for sports arenas or businesses that want to headquarter themselves downtown.\n\nTo give some background, I'm originally from the metro Detroit area and while Detroit's doing a TON better than it used to even five years ago, it's really noticeable that you can travel miles and only see a couple of grocery stores compared to the denser metro Detroit suburbs.

        "text": "Recently, there was post on here about Japanese vs. American planning, and it got me thinking about a lot of things.\nFor a little bit of context, I'm a Japanese citizen who has been living in the US with a green card for about 9 years. I just graduated high school this summer, so I've lived half of my life in the US. I spent my older half of my time in the US, but I get homesick about Japan very often.\nThis Fall, I'm going to attend to Cornell University to study urban planning and also continue on to get a Master's degree in planning. But after that, I think I would like to return to Japan. However, it seems that planning in Japan and the US are very different, and I worry that an American degree might not be utilized as well in Japan. Many of the basic principles probably carry over but especially when it comes to the policy portion I figure it will be very different.\nFrom the couple of planning courses I have taken and the few books I have read, I am very interested in pursuing transportation planning.\nIs there anyone who is more well read or well versed in planning that might enlighten me to the opportunities I might be able to find in Japan? I'm going to be looking out of foreign exchange programs, but I am particularly concerned about being able to be employed and how helpful I might be able to be with a planning degree from the US. I feel like I've adopted a very American mindset but I look like any other Japanese guy, so I'm also worried I won't be given as much leeway as I try to adjust to the work culture and society of Japan.",
