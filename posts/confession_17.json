It was a very close game and the previous game I had hit a double with bases loaded so coach put me in to hit thinking I would be clutch. As I walked up to the plate I could see my teammate was visibly disappointed coach didn‚Äôt let him hit, but to me that didn‚Äôt matter because I was gonna help the team out. I get up to the plate and the pitcher paints a fastball on the outside corner. Usually that‚Äôs my zone as I‚Äôm a good oppo hitter but I froze under pressure. Next pitch was a ball but after that he threw the same outside fastball and I didn‚Äôt swing at a single pitch. As I took the walk of shame back to the dugout I could see the anger in my teammates face. I‚Äôm feel so guilty that I took his at bat but also that coach trusted me and I crumbles under pressure. I know it sounds stupid but I can‚Äôt shake the guilt and disappointment in myself.",

        "text": "It all started with a friend where she‚Äôd show me all these nice things she got. I remember judging her ,how does she not get caught? And being offended when she gave me something that was stolen rather bought and her dad gives her quite a lot of money and she rly has no need for stealing, but tends to spend most on weed. First time I went with her I got 2 small things only that I needed. Then it turned into a spree for fun, and next thing you know my table was full of things I wanted and needed. I only get things twice a year on Christmas and my birthday so I really never get to get too much personally. So even getting clothes and feeling like I can fit in more having things. It‚Äôs just a shame when others see I steal like a friend or my sister. But it‚Äôs like jobs are never hiring and managers are always demanding so much labor, there‚Äôs no easy way of side money, and it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve looked forward too in a sense where I could just steal and get away with it whenever I go to a store . It does make me feel guilty like I wish I didn‚Äôt start. It‚Äôs just I‚Äôve always been the friend passing on food a lot or doing cute small things cause I just wouldn‚Äôt have things like that. But I probably will stop since it‚Äôs not worth trouble in the future",

He was one of those guys that peaked in college and pretended like he was still a student; the dude was in his mid 40's. He would get belligerently drunk and hit on girls at the bar and invite them out on his boat on the weekends, just a total creep. He had favorites that worked for him and could care less about the rest that worked there.\n\nAnyway, we were charging cover that morning and the bar was packed with tons of people waiting outside to get in. Me, being a broke college student, decided to just start pocketing some of the money. I worked from 8 AM to the end of the game and was sliding cash in my pocket here and there. It wasn't until I got home that I realized how much I had took. It was around $300. I felt bad for taking that much at first but, then I remembered that my boss was a douche and, well frankly, I needed drinking money. I ended up getting away with it because there was so many people in and out that day, that there's no way anyone could say the cover money was short. He was too drunk to even notice.\n\nThat was the only time I did it. I ended up quitting a couple months later because I just couldn't tolerate it anymore.",

        "text": "I thought I won the lottery when I moved into a new house a friend had recently bought. She bought the house for the sole purpose of renting it out and I decided to rent the top floor making it my own little studio with a big roof terrace, the bottom floor had their own outside area. The way it was explained to me the roof terrace was part of my studio. The house used to be a hostel and was sold with everything still in it, and it was quite a mess. I got a few friends over for the weekend to clean everything up, buy a few new things like outside furniture, and make it look pretty. It was hard work but afterwards it looked amazing, especially the roof terrace which I turned into my own slice of meditation/lounge heaven.\n\nAfter about a month my friend decided she was going to move out of her own house (to rent it out and make more money) and move in with us, but there was no room available so I wondered what her plan was. Turns out she wants to take part of the roof terrace and turn it into her room. So I argued it was part of what I rented, turns out she meant I could use it while she allowed it but it wasn't part of my rental. Of course we argued, but when it got to the point of fighting and losing a friend and a house I decided to budge and adjust the roof terrace to fit her room. To her credit she only took 60 sq feet but it was a sign of things to come. \n\nLong story short she was cheap, was slow with fixing things around the house, always sought the cheapest solutions that would break again quickly, would put a timer on the hot boiler so there would often be no warm water for showers, would constantly complain about leaving lights on etc etc. But what finally pushed my buttons to my confessional was when she took my motor oil, a full gallon, and put it in her car. When I came home and saw it missing she first denied until she couldn't deny no longer, she then admitted but refused to pay for the replacement. We had a huge fight and I told her I'm going to look for a new house. In the weeks following I disabled the washing machine, the oven, the fridge, the locks, and her car. She had to fix all of them costing her way more than just replacing my oil. She never suspected it was me for some reason, and I left 3 weeks later never to speak to her again. I never told anyone cause it makes me look petty and vindictive, but I'm not sorry at all, maybe even a little bit proud that I stood up for myself.",
