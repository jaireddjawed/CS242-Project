I'm just so sick of feeling like I'm doing everything I can to not be lonely, and still being SO lonely all the time. I know there's a post every day about how to make friends after 30, and that's not even it - I'm doing everything I can think to do. I go to meetups, I volunteer, I take classes, I go to yoga. And I do meet people! I meet people and get asked to lunch, art shows, or yoga, but I'm not making real friends or connections, at least not yet. I also have old friends, but they are all partnered and quite honestly I am the one always making the effort. I get it, I've been there - but it doesn't make me feel any better. And I guess dating is the other solution, but quite honestly it makes me lonelier somehow. \n\nJust a lot of unfortunately timed life events have led me here - the pandemic, moving for a man who was cheating, moving again to a new city, alone. During that time all my other friend's lives have gone on - they've gotten married or moved or whatever. And it is totally my fault for isolating myself the past few years, but there's nothing I can do about that now. I've never struggled to make friends before. I am so so sick of spending Friday and Saturday night by myself. Sure, I could go on a date but I just really want a group (or even one girlfriend!!) to go out with. And yes, I like my own company, I do things with myself often. But we still need friends. I'm trying SO HARD to just make a friend who is in the same life stage as me, and I just can't seem to get there. Can anyone relate? If nothing else, I hope this post helps someone realize they aren't alone.",

Its very, very early stages in our knowing each other, but we've been acquainted through work for around 6 months or so and just get on like a house on fire. The person I've got to know is mature, sensitive, insightful... But he is ultimately still 25 years old. \n\n\nFor me personally, I know that without meeting someone in person you can never know whether there's something there or not. The smallest things can be a major ick and just turn off everything that you think is there. I've been there and learned this lesson on many occasions. So I'm under no illusion that the friendship we've built would necessarily transform into something else if we were to meet. But the possibility remains.\n\n\nI am however now thinking about whether we should keep heading in the direction in which we are just naturally heading, or whether I should be wise enough to know that 25 is 25 ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I've briefly mentioned the age gap between us to him and he just shrugs it off, clearly unconcerned.\n\n\nVery interested in your opinions!",

        "text": "I watched Pam Anderson‚Äôs doc last night and it broke my heart. She‚Äôs a normal woman who wanted normal things in her relationships. She sounds like a solid partner as long as she‚Äôs loved and they‚Äôre faithful. She was leaving when these men abused her. A simple enough reason. \n\nI think we‚Äôve all been blamed for having ‚Äúa broken picker‚Äù or choosing men who will mistreat us, but I think that‚Äôs a very misinformed perspective. Women like Pam are approached by a certain kind of man and not approached by others who might be ‚Äúnicer‚Äù men. She can pick nice guys all day long but she‚Äôs not chosen by them.  \n\nI think this happens with a lot of beautiful women. The only ones who shoot their shot are narcissistic or see her as an achievement/object. A cure to their insecurities. The kind of men who were capable of being a partner are either too insecure to even try, judge her as too much, or don‚Äôt even see her as human. What a woman in the Midwest considers a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù has Pam‚Äôs sex tape hidden in the garage and would argue she deserved the abuse.  She doesn‚Äôt get to choose nicer men. The nice guys don‚Äôt choose her or they simply aren‚Äôt nice when it comes to her. \n\nSo she gets knocked around until she ages out of the cyclone or horny men and then she‚Äôs suddenly a moral example of why you shouldn‚Äôt be too sexy or look what happens when you don‚Äôt choose the nice guys. It‚Äôs a trap from the start. \n\nAnd so she does all the right things in life and can never again find the love she‚Äôd had with Tommy. It‚Äôs rare. It begs the question is it rare enough to compromise? Did she ever really have the option of love and stability? If what she wanted was love, would the more strategic move have been to stay with him? And do we even imagine he‚Äôd stay faithful to her?\n\nI think this happens with a lot of beautiful or successful women. They get blamed for choosing bad men when men just don‚Äôt see them as someone deserving good. Then when they‚Äôre alone, they‚Äôre made an example of why you can‚Äôt be both Madonna and whore.",

        "text": "I returned to my hometown late last year with hopes of finding a sense of community. Previously, I had left to live in a major city where I found it almost impossible to find any community. \n\nBefore I had left for the city, here in my hometown, I had been a part of a music scene and it was a 50/50 split between loving and hating it. I loved playing music and the scene was idealistic, but extremely toxic. It felt like the problematic people always won in the end, and it left me disillusioned to the point that I sold all my gear, stopped playing and moved away. TBH, I chalked it up to music scene problems/drama. And, I wasn't surprised, upon my return, to find that that group had long ago dissolved and accomplished absolutely nothing. \n\nWhen I moved back, I started dating someone who works for a community organization (not music-related), and felt hopeful about a fresh start. I did overlook a lot of red flags, and after only a few months, I ended up breaking things off with the dude due to addiction issues, money problems, lying, etc. It still is affecting me that this person was essentially wearing a mask the entire time, and once it slipped, he turned into someone wholly different and worked hard to get myself and his roommate's gf (who also witnessed his mask slip) out of his life and the community. \n\nWell, before this happened, the place he works for hired a new executive director who had been told I have a strong background in nonprofit work and grant writing. Despite my hesitations and me being upfront about feeling unsure if I still wanted to volunteer, this guy won me over. He's the opposite of the toxic people and has real hopes and goals. I want to help him, genuinely, but I also am realizing how the majority of this group are just terrible people. Ideally, he would clean house, but I doubt that will happen. Though, he did say he was tasked with \"helping them to mature,\" and interestingly, he essentially told me (without any prompt) that my ex isn't performing well at his job. Part of me, I'll admit, wants to stick around just to see his downfall and wave as he packs his bags, but another part of me knows that's petty and, isn't worth it. \n\nAre all communities this way, or is it just this town? Is it worth it for me to stick around and see is this places changes, or should I just turn my back on it as well and focus on building my own community? \n\nPart of the problem is, and if anyone can relate, I did not have a 'normal' upbringing and I think a part of me is drawn to music scenes, etc., because when I'm around other 'fuck-ups' I feel less judged, less awkward, more 'normal,' etc.. but the thing is, I'm pretty high functioning. I have multiple degrees, I lived in a major city for over a decade, etc. On the outside,I'm able to look 'normal,' but I feel perpetually caught between two worlds -- one where I pass as normal, but feel like an outsider, and one where I'm a misfit who fits in with other misfits, but these people are often are problematic and not working on their issues, whereas I am. \n\nThis leaves me in a middle space where I wish I could find a group of other people where are misfits who aren't being toxic and shitty, but that seems impossible. It feels like I either have to pretend to be normal and feel perpetually alone inside, or I have to stoop to toxic peoples' levels and just be a shitty fuckup to feel any sense of community. And, both options feel awful and make me want to isolate and be alone, which also sucks.",

Not long conversations, but more like \"Hey, I am so tired of working, lets make some tea.\"\n3. Me and m husband enjoy playing boardgames, but some boardgames are more fun to play with 3-6 players than with two. Then our plushies play with us. Of course it is not possible to play poker or Alias with plushies, but some games, like Carcassonne or Pandemic, are totally playable.",

She gets excited and tells me the feeling is mutual.\n\nWe really fall hard for each other. There is no denying it. Out of the blue she leaves me because of a fortune teller reading.\n\nTo give context she is Japanese and spiritual. Leading into the relationship was \"this is a sign\" and \"we are soulmates\" and I just ate it all up because... I love her.\n\nShe tells me the fortune teller said our relationship will end ugly. And then she will realize the pain she caused her son when she abandoned the family for me.\n\nI said bring the son. I'd love to be a family. She said father's bond is so strong she can't do that to him. Even though she has no love for him. She tells me that last time we will talk.\n\n2 days later I get a call she is thinking about me. Another 2 days we are meeting together with mutual friends at my house and discussing the whole thing.\n\nNow she wants to see another fortune teller together to have our futures read.\n\nI love this woman and her son. I will go. And I want to just bring positive energy to this weird reading and hope my wishes come true.\n\nAm I crazy? I need advice. I swear on everything I have never loved anyone the way I do her.

(It's Friday evening now)\n\nSo, anyone know what DVT or blood clot feels like? I \\*think\\* my right leg is slightly swollen but it's really hard to tell. I asked my kids but they can't see any swelling, but my husband said, it's hard to tell, but maybe the right leg is slightly swollen. (!) That's the leg that hurts.\n\nI'm assuming the swelling would be very obvious, which it is not atm. And I'm also watching for redness and warmth, both currently absent.\n\nOH boy. If it's not one thing, it's another.\n\nI'm scared I'll have pulmonary embolism suddenly.  \n\n\nQuestion is: IF you had a blood clot, what did it feel like and what happened?\n\n  \n\n\nP.S.

Would it be weird for me to bring them a thank you note as a token of my appreciation? I know of course that their job to provide good hospitality, but I still think it's important to recognize good service and show appreciation when it's warranted. If a thank you note isn't too much, what about a small gift such as a gift card, baked goods,...?

The reason she gave for the break up was that she decided from observing (NOT from actually asking me) that I still want a wife and kids and she does not and also does not want to live together, so she was letting me go so I could find what was a better match for me.\n\nI have several issues with this break up, but that is not the point of this post. My ex is confident that I can still find a woman to marry and have a family with. I argued that it is highly unlikely (I know it is not impossible) due to my age of 48. Realistically speaking, I am few years away before I would be in a relationship with a woman who would then get pregnant. She has more confidence that I do that this is possible.\n\nI am here to poll the women here to see how likely you think women would be to meet a guy 48 - 50, assume everything else is ok. She would need to be single, willing to marry, live together, and have kids.\n\nI am not ready to date yet (too soon after the break up that I am still grieving), but I would like a realistic answer now before I start planning my next few years.\n\nIf you want more info, just ask and I will provide as best as I can. I am not sure what I could also provide but I am open to do so.\n\nThank you.",

He said he knows my heart was in the right place, but he wishes he knew, and he did not have a good relationship with his sister.\n\n\nTo top it off, the delivery has been delayed. I paid $60 to get it there Wed thru Friday. I am SO mortified. And I don't know that I can move past this. My head says \"you crossed the line, otherwise you wouldn't be hurt\". It's selfish of me to feel sad when he is going thru so much. It's selfish of me to make my feelings of fear to come before his needs. But to me, that means I crossed a line.

        "text": "My daughter (F25) has convinced herself nobody will marry her and i am watching her mentally destroy herself. Help\n\nThrowaway account as I do not want her to see i am seeking advice over the internet for this matter! Though I am really at my wits end and am terrified for the road my daughter is heading down.\n\nMy daughter is due to turn 25 in 2 weeks and ever since I can remember, she has had major major self esteem issues, however ever since she turned 20 5 years ago, this has taken a real dark turn when she has convinced herself nobody will marry her, she is too ugly for love, too ugly to be someones daughter in-law, and she will never ever have any children. It is heartbreaking for me to hear her say these things and I genuinely put it down to teenage insecurities a few year back, however in the last few years have taken a sinister turn for the worst.\n\nShe refuses to attend any weddings at all, even her close cousins (she lied saying she had Covid and I sure as hell knew this but knew she would have honestly mentally broke down going to the wedding) saying it is \"too painful\" for her to watch other people have a life she desperately wants. She has cut off all her friends from school/college as most of them have partners, have gotten pregnant in the last year or so and she said she physically cannot bear to see them have children when she knows she is never going to have any. My heart truly ripped into 2 when she told me this, I since asked her why she thinks she wont have any children? And she said she is too ugly for love, that nobody would ever love her, or have kids with her. She said her dream is too have a man love and marry her, and have a lovely life and children together. I partly blame instagram and these influencers for this indoctrination and glorifying marriage and childhood, however  our stupid culture and it's obsession with marriage i believe has lead to her to become so desperate and eager.  \n\nShe bursts into tears over baby adverts, couples in a store, she can be helping me out around the house and randomly bursts into tears. I am so worried about her state of mind  and why she has got like this. When I catch her crying and ask why, she tells me she is sorry she won't be able to give me any grandkids, and she is sorry she is letting me and her Dad down by not being married yet, and she is sorry our electricity bill is so high with her still living at home, and if she was married we would not have to worry about our bills so much! I was absolutely appalled to hear this and sooooo disturbed at how her mind is currently working, I reassured her she is no burden to me or her father (who i am divorced from) and she is not the cause of any shame, or any other stress, especially a silly electric bill! I assured her she would find someone one day however she said it is not her fault she looks like this and nobody will marry her and she will never be a mother. She said she dosent see a point in living if she is just ugly and nobody will marry her, and that she has considered suicide many times.  I was lost for words to hear this and gave her a big hug and told her there would be a massive hole in my heart if she left us. \n\nThings to an event more sinister turn today which have left me increasingly disturbed and i am really close to honestly getting a mental health team to take her in. She is slowly turning herself crazy. I asked today to borrow her laptop for some online shopping, and as soon as i opened it she had left open her tabs, which contained details of IVF procedures, Adoption, and another tab showed she had made a google search of \"How to have children without a partner\". I am super super disturbed and this and confronted her about this,and she just burst into tears saying it is \"destroying her inside\" that she will never be a mother. In a group chat with myself, my sister (her aunt) and my other daughter, a photo was sent of a celebrity who recently became a parent. My daughter had the most hysterical reaction to this and began to cry sooo badly, saying it was too painful for her to see, and we had to get her seriously seen too calm her down. \n\nAfter this conversation I contacted her GP however she has intervened and since said she would rather get counselling /professional help through her Work benefits systems. I am relieved she is getting it and willing to get some help however i am really unsure how to support her and unsure if i trust she will even attend these appointments. Can someone please explain what is happening to my beautiful girl. She is 25, has a degree, has a masters, is working, however her father and I are growing more and more concerned and disturbed about her state of mind. I blame these silly aunties for enforcing marriage and no other success on young girls, instagram and social media for glorifying marriage and she has also had severe self esteem issues and rejections from lads throughout her life. She has never opened up to me about this with us being south asian and boys not existing till the age or 25+ however her brother has told me bits and bobs of the kind of things which boys would say to her in school..which again really broke my heart. \n\nI have also recently noticed she walks straight to the baby aisle and enjoys browsing at clothing, prams, toys, and goes into a really silent, different world when I see her. When she cried about the celebrity photo, I asked her why, if this is so painful for her, why she continues to go into baby sections so frequently and enjoys looking and browsing. I told her to stay away from such things if they are triggers, and focus on shopping and browsing for things that are good for her mind! However she said she goes into a \"happy imaginary world\" pretending she is a mother shopping for a child, and has a husband waiting for her at home. she said it makes her happy and excited when she goes into this imaginary world. I was disturbed beyond belief when she told me this.\n\nMy daughter was quite chubby growing up and still struggles with her weight,and she has asked me in the past why \"pretty girls only get choosen\" I explained to her personality plays a big part however she is adamant she is not going to have kids or a family because of how she looks.\n\nJust want some more thoughts on what people think is wrong with her and why this has go to a point where she is now considerding IVF and adoption! She is too young for all this, In my opinion she is even too young for children so why she is worrying so much I really dont know.\n\nIf anyone could shed some light, as you can imagine we are sick with worry as parents\n\nThanks  so much everyone.",

And I rarely did anyway. It's the type of group where if you share something with one person, it's spread to the whole group. Always said in confidence, of course, to the next person. Eventually everyone has been told \"in confidence.\" I believe I've outgrown these friendships, but since they're lifelong friends, it's tough to let go.\n\nThe main one that frustrates me is that I've had this pretty good friend that I've decided in the past year I am not going to share with her anymore. One, she doesn't keep anything private.  When we first became friends, I didn't mind if I shared info with her because we didn't have the same friend group so no one for her to tell. Ohh was I wrong. Over the years, friends slowly meshed together. I told her a very private thing at the beginning of our friendship and she shared that with other people. Second, I feel like she has become a little more judgmental as her life has slowly come together. I really strive to be a judgement free person so this feeling of judgement nags at me.\n\nI do have some other good friends I speak with that would not share my secrets. They always seem like they are really listening to me. But later they only remember half the story or don't remember the story at all. Could be bad memory, but honestly I think they just don't care what I'm sharing with them. And makes me think maybe we're not as good of friends as I think we are?\n\nWho do you guys go to for a confidential conversation? I don't have much personal info I need to share but I want to know that I can vent to a friend a little without feeling judged.",

        "text": "This is for those who may currently be on a feminine energy/masculine energy dating advice kick. I did many of the wrong things according to certain advice (especially those TikTok gurus - dang the algorithm!) and I still find myself in a great relationship. I just want to share my experience to show a different perspective.\n¬†\nWhen I (29F) met my partner (39M) a few months ago, we expressed mutual interest in our connection but agreed to take it slow, so we weren‚Äôt rushing to use labels. Though I was wary of falling into situationship territory, I decided to be my most confident and authentic self and trust the journey, wherever it may take me. I initiated a kiss on the first date, texted whenever I wanted to, took initiative with planning activities, took turns paying for dates, had sex on the 2nd date, and continued to be intimate at every opportunity. (I was not about to deny my high sex drive for the sake of strategy!) \n\nHe matched my energy every step of the way, so I continued to give him the full ‚Äúgirlfriend experience‚Äù for 2 months until he asked me to be his girlfriend. We‚Äôre now one month into a relationship I asked him how he felt it was going to which he said he appreciates the effort and energy I put in from the beginning and that it inspires him to take more initiative with planning fun dates for us as well. Imagine that!\n¬†\nI‚Äôve listened to so many people say the best dating strategy is to be in your ‚Äúfeminine energy‚Äù by not taking the lead as a woman or setting any tone of taking charge because it‚Äôll surely set the wrong expectation and lead to laziness in the man. They warn that this encourages him to step back and let you do everything, instead of mirroring your efforts as intended, because of an energy imbalance. While an interesting theory and probably true for some, this is not always the case. And who‚Äôs to say that a mix of masculine and feminine energies in both partners can‚Äôt be just as fulfilling? My thought is this: if the person you‚Äôre with just lets things continue to be one-sided in ANY regard; time/effort/money/etc., maybe they‚Äôre just not into you OR maybe you‚Äôre dating a very selfish person!\n¬†\nIt‚Äôs 2023 and is it really so crazy to not expect men and women alike to be capable, independent, thoughtful, responsible, mature, self-aware adults. I think better advice would be to show up in EVERY aspect that is important to you for a thriving relationship and only continue to date them if they‚Äôre willing to do the same.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. So I recently joined a new job. I‚Äôm in tech industry btw‚Ä¶. So there is my boss and there‚Äôs another senior engineer. I mostly work with both of them. Although my boss is whom I go to for everything , I do have to work with this other senior engineer too. When I first started this senior engineer wasn‚Äôt all that warm so I started talking to him more - we became more friendly. What I didn‚Äôt like about this is that he was extremely touchy- just my arms and stuff. I do not like this although I don‚Äôt think he meant anything wrong - I think he doesn‚Äôt mean harm or is trying to make me uncomfortable but i still didn‚Äôt like it .And so as days went by on I got very friendly talking to him not because I‚Äôm trying to be flirtatious or what but because It‚Äôs just both of us in the department plus he does answer a lot of my questions work wise. It came to one day where we were working on a machine on the building floor with other technicians. He introduced me to everyone else on the floor since it was my first time out there and he was extremely touchy once again- shoulders etc. I didn‚Äôt like it but I was just quiet. Now as I was sitting down and working. I think he was talking to someone else about their diet and says something along the lines that ‚Äúyeah diets don‚Äôt work for both of you ‚Äú- indirectly calling me fat. This seemed pretty rude to me but I was still quiet. After a while he just unties my pony tail FOR FUN and laughs hysterically about it... This made me really mad. I was done being quiet and I literally said ‚Äúyou cant do that‚Äù In a very angry tone. He apologized like 10 minutes later and I strictly told him ‚Äúno matter what you do just don‚Äôt touch me‚Äù. This happened three weeks ago. Now he‚Äôs all salty to me although it wasn‚Äôt me who was at fault. Sometimes I try and talk to him or even ask work related stuff because it is my job.  He straight up brushes me off but talks very nicely to everyone else. I feel really disturbed by this. Although this isn‚Äôt sexual assault, it is a form of assault and I‚Äôm allowed to be angry about it for at least ten minutes. After ten minutes on the day this happened, I was back to being my normal self btw. But I am the one who is being punished. I feel so uncomfortable being at work these days. I am trying to be professional but this guy just seems like a big burden basically. Any advice? How do I professionally dodge this situation or just make it better? PS : i don‚Äôt want to confront anyone.",

        "text": "I have a friend [33f] who recently went through a divorce and has started dating again. She was seeing a guy for about 3 months, and in those 3 months, there were a lot of issues between them- mostly she would get upset when he wouldn't text her back quickly enough or with enough enthusiasm. After she expressed her feelings to him several times, he told her he didn't think he could meet her needs and ended it. Throughout the short relationship, my friend would reach out to me constantly for advice. She would send me screenshots of their conversations. In hindsight, I wish I had handled it differently from the beginning, but I wanted to be supportive, esp since I know she's going through a tough transition. I would respond and engage with her and offer support. I was as honest and kind as possible, but I can completely see how this guy was getting overwhelmed by her.\n\nAnyways, the whole thing is now feeling very high school and I'm frankly exhausted and don't really want to talk about it anymore. I'm also finding it harder to be supportive because my friend is doing some things that I think are a bit out of line. Like, she reached out to this guy's sister to ask her why he was \"going dark\" on her. She had never met his sister before, just found her on social media. She also has been waiting and hoping that the guy will reach out to her after he told her he needed space a little over a week ago. She texted him today an \"I miss you\" text, which was clearly crossing this guy's boundary.\n\nI know dating can be hard and I know my friend is a bit out of practice. I care about her and want to be there for her, but I also feel like -- like this guy -- she can be really intense. I have been honest with her, especially more recently, about how I think she needs to trust what this guy is telling her and respect his boundaries, but she obviously doesn't take my advice (lol). I know she just wants/needs someone to talk to.\n\nHow would you guys approach this? Talk to her about it and set a clear boundary? Only respond when I'm available to? Or something else?",

        "text": "Writing this at work...but the title really says it all. I am 36(f) and am a licensed social worker. I worked hard to get my master's and genuinely love helping the clients I work with to navigate barriers and have successful outcomes. I started out doing general case management and created my own niche in helping individuals with chronic conditions apply for social security disability. Case management totally burned me out because of the constant obstacles and main concerns being around housing, which is near impossible to navigate in the high cost of living city I live in. My niche has grown into a small department and has been incredibly fulfilling over the past few years, until the pandemic. All of the shortfalls, staffing issues, red tape, and government bureaucracy of the social security system has taken a toll on my mental health. I take the brunt of all of it for the clients I serve because it is such a complex and fucked up system to navigate and for the past few months I've found myself slowly giving less and less. Many days I put in the minimal amount of effort required and now I'm feeling even worse because of that guilt. I never let anything go to the detriment of my clients, but I am feeling very much a shell of myself. I am constantly questioning if this is where I am meant to be. I am 36 and have done nothing but social work in my professional career. I envy my friends who have non-social work jobs that don't get anxiety and lose sleep over their jobs. I have a friend the other day talk to me about being miserable in her job and say to me that it's so cool to have a job where I make a meaningful impact on people's lives, but honestly the grass is greener. Sometimes the pressure is too much. More often I feel like the world is just falling apart and the systems are fucked and no one really cares about those who are marginalized and I should just focus on myself and the ones I love. This is not something that can be fixed by a vacation or self-care. I am child-free with a loving husband and dog and we take many trips and have a wonderful friend group, etc. I am at a loss for what to do and the thought of switching careers sounds so daunting to me. I keep telling myself to buck up and everyone has times when they don't love their job, but I just don't know how sustainable this is for me long-term. I am so tired of being the one to have all of the answers. It is exhausting. A single call to social security to check on case status can take 2 hours of my time with dropped calls, hold times, reps not understanding what I am talking about, or being rude because they are also burnt out, and it's just a lot. I know this is the most whiny woe is me post, but I am hoping some of you wonderful souls may have some insight, advice, etc. \n\n\\#tiredinAustin",

(I didn‚Äôt even know this was an option when I started receiving well-woman care as a young adult.) Paps used to make me really anxious and tense and I‚Äôd only have 5-10 minutes to talk to my GYN which added to the anxiety/rushed feeling. This also made it more challenging to talk about personal things related to sex because there was so little time for any sort of rapport building. \n\nWhen I moved to a new state, I transitioned to care with a CNM (and have since received care from multiple CNMs over the past few years) and the difference has been remarkable. My CNM spent 20-30 minutes talking to me and answering my questions, identified a pelvic floor issue that pelvic floor PT radically improved, and overall made me feel safe, heard and genuinely connected with. She also asked a lot about mental health which I appreciated. My CNM also recommended a vaginal probiotic (Fem Dopholis) that‚Äôs been amazing! Apparently there‚Äôs peer-reviewed research to support its efficacy in preventing/helping mitigate UTIs, BV and vaginitis too. Could not believe I‚Äôd never heard of it?!\n\nThere are plenty of great OBGYNs and GYNs out there who do really meaningful work when it comes to complex medical and surgical needs, but overall I‚Äôve really preferred my CNM experiences. It‚Äôs been awesome to feel treated like a whole person, especially when it comes to such a private and personal subject matter.",

But the alcohol makes his anxiety worse the next day. \n\nWhen he is home, he is absent, or may as well be. He just scrolls on his phone. He ignores our toddler who tries to engage with him.  He claims scrolling is all he can even do. \n\nBut here's the thing, he goes to work. He's the breadwinner. He will call home when he is at work and sounds like a completely different human! He is happy and funny! His normal self! \n\nI'm not saying his health anxiety isn't real, but it feels like a scapegoat at times. Over the last couple months I've literally taken on all household responsibilities and child rearing responsibilities to alleviate stress from him. I asked him to do breakfast with our toddler and he literally just stares at his phone. I can't watch it anymore. And honestly, I am wondering if this could be more damaging to my baby than him just not even being in the house! \n\nI am feeling really alone right now and isolated because I can't talk to anyone about it because he is so embarrassed. The icing on the cake, i just found out I am pregnant with number 2. Got knocked up the one time we had sex in months. \n\nAny advice would be welcomed. I love him so much, but I don't have a lot of patience for him right now. I really need a partner.",

I've been a licensed cosmetologist for 10 years now, I enjoy hair, although where I live it's a mediocre job unless you devote your entire life to standing behind the chair. I refuse to do that to my body, or my family, so am looking for a change. I just had a baby this august (our last child, we have 3 total) and just started school this January again. I know it is going to take a while to get where I'm going, planning on starting with a bachelors in Psychology and then working toward my masters or PhD depending on what area I would like to focus in as I get closer to that time period. I think it stresses me out thinking about how long I will be in school and the amount of money in student loans I'll have and if it will end up paying off in the long run. Right now I'm lucky to make 20k a year with my expenses and booth rental. Granted I'm only working part time because of this stage of life with being a parent and going to school. Has anyone here done this successfully? I just feel like by the time I get started in a new career field I will be at earliest 35, and at latest closer to 40, which feels intimidating to start brand new in a workplace.

        "text": "I've always had body issues but most of my life I thought the issue was my body and now that I'm older I realize my weight is fine, the real issue is what's going on with how I think about myself. Just to be clear, I don't want to lose any weight. I'm almost 40 so I understand that as we age it's natural for our bodies to change, to gain weight, to fill out. I'm ok with that. As long as I stay at home and don't go out. If I have to go out I have anxiety about how I look and getting dressed is so stressful because I feel like nothing looks good on me. I live in leggings and big sweaters because of my body image anxiety. I just want to be happy in my own skin and I am but I'm not. So I'm curious to hear from other women how you handle body image, weight gain and self esteem.\n\nSo I know where my body issues come from. But knowing that doesn't help me stop the feelings. You see I have the same general body type as my mother and all the women on her side of the family but I'm still bigger than them because they are all tiny petite Indian women and I'm only half indian. All their lives staying skinny was a high priority and my female cousins and I faced much scrutiny as we started to develop. I got the tiny genes but some of my other mixed cousins did not and much negative and shaming commentary was made about their size and weight by all the women in the family. Even though I was the smallest, and \"blessed with the good genes\" if I ever put on weight my mom would be very critical of me. If any of my aunts put on weight, they'd all have something critical to say about her body/appearance.\n\nI started working out in high school and when I was in my 20's I was all about extreme diet and exercise to stay as thin as possible. One time getting down to 75lbs and even then at my thinest I still always thought I could be thinner or I was too pear shaped or I was too thick. \n\nWhenever I tried to talk to other girls/women about my weight the response was always very dismissive like you're so tiny what are you complaining about or I'd kill to be tiny like you or you don't have a problem cause you're not big like me or various other shut me down type of things. I never understood it because if girls are talking and Sally is 5'6\" and complains she put on 20lbs how come I can't commiserate if I'm 5'0\" and I've gained 20lbs? So I learned at a young age that I cannot bring up my weight or body size issues with normal sized north american women. But I can't help that I have a different body type than them because of my mixed ethnic background. Because of this shaming me kind of attitude, I've never been able to talk about weight or body issues with other women outside my family. And clearly talking about it with women in my family wasn't helpful because they're all nuts.\n\nThen one day a few years ago, I had this realization. My SIL invited me to hang out at a beach near them and I was up all night the night before in sleepless anxiety that I would have to wear a bikini and that I'd look fat in it. I'd given up on working out a few years back due to medical issues and I was freaking out about showing my body. Then when I got there I realized how crazy it all was. My SIL had recently had a baby and was in a bikini no problem and people of all shapes and sizes are wearing bikinis, just living their life. No one cares what I was wearing or what I looked like. It really hit me then how all that anxiety was for nothing and that maybe there's something wrong with the way I think. Especially when in reality literally everyone is bigger than me and absolutely no one has a flat stomach or perfect body.\n\nThen the pandemic happened so I never went to another beach and forgot all about this body issues stuff. Like many I gained weight during the pandemic, going from xs to medium. I work from home so I bought bigger comfy clothes and cause we weren't going anywhere I never replaced my nice clothes.\n\nBut now I have a beach trip coming up and none of my vacation clothes fit so I've been ordering new stuff in bigger sizes and I feel like I look so bad in everything. I'm back to not sleeping like I was that night before the beach with my SIL only now I realize I'm being irrational. But even knowing I'm being irrational, I still have all this anxiety about wearing swimwear and nice summer clothes. I know it shouldn't bother me but knowing it isn't stopping these feelings.\n\nYesterday I saw my neice on IG wearing a crop top and dressy shorts. She is short and thick and just had a baby 3 months ago. She looked amazing! She was smiling and confident and it all looked so well put together. I realized I want to be like that. If she doesn't feel the need to cover up with baggy clothes, why do I? I'm ok with my body changing and aging, I don't want to be like my mom/aunts obsessed with being skinny. \n\nBut I have no idea how I'm going to take off all these layers and enjoy a beach vacation looking the way I do. I know I'm not alone in this pandemic weight gain but I don't know how to deal with it mentally and I don't have anyone I can talk to about this.\n\nSo ladies, please enlighten me. How do you stop caring and go to the beach?",

        "text": "I need to say I am afraid to someone. I guess I am looking for encouragement. You can TLDR the last paragraph. \n\nI met (30F) my partner (29M) last February and the moment I met him I knew he is the one for me. He is an amazing person, positive, strong, kind, considerate, aware, gentle, dominant, interested in everything, hungry for life and knowledge - I have been searching for this my whole life. One of the most important aspirations I have throughout my whole life is a fulfilling partner and having family life with him. We just moved in together, officially now but we've been together in my apartment for 2 months now. We want to live our life together and make a family, have children. Throughout the relationship we have some misunderstandings from time to time that go with strong feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, but only because were unsure of these parts of ourselves - the other side is always okay with those - we try to communicate them through and solve them, we do that mostly successfuly.\n\nHe is finishing his master's and just quit his job due to working in a toxic environment and since he has a competition ban (can't work in the field for the following 2 year in our home country) he's trying to find a job or an internship abroad. He seems to have managed to do so and now he's about to start preparing the documentation. Right now, this is a maximum one year thing where it is not possible for us to go together, and we know that.\n\nI am working last 5 years at one place where I am underpaid (third world country). This job is the peak of my interest in my field and maximum pay I can get here, and going abroad is really difficult because artists are not wanted so much unless they super-excell (which I don't). After the pursuit of this lovely job and the permeant contract throughout the years I got tired and now I'm there - but unhappy and unsatisfied and unfulfilled. I have to change, and the only way is through courses and studying at home, not quitting everything because I can't afford that, and doing two things at the same time until I, after several years, don't start working in the other chosen filed (with no official diploma).\n\nI have to study and work here, he will most likely go abroad for couple of months, a year, but maybe for more for this internship. I know we can live without eachother, everyone can live alone and single, sometimes it is not a choice, but I don't want that and I am afraid that after he goes away, he'll have a change of heart and not come back to me, mostly in a way that it will be difficult to adjust again and reconnect and that we'll feel like strangers. I am so afraid and I have no other option than to accept this and wait. The relationship with him continually teaches me that I just have to be a fruitful ground, loving and caring, supportive and also a lover, like a true family, but I don't know how do I keep being loving when this scares the fuck out of me and I tend to withdraw more in my insecurities. He can meet 100x prettier, stronger, successful woman or just understand that he's better off without me. I am torn",

        "text": "I (30f) have had a crush on Dan (32m) for a long time; about a year. It's intense. Have you had that? A strong sense of '*wow, that's what it's meant to be like*'. My feelings towards them actually helped me see how wrong my (then) relationship was for me. \n\n\nMe and my ex broke up for numerous reasons, but part of it was 'I need someone more like Dan'. \n\nDan drove an hour for my birthday where he knew no one but me and that's when I thought '*maybe he is interested*...'\n\n\nMy friend (24f), knowing Dan was my crush, and that I was looking for signs, joined my art class he runs and asked him out a month after my breakup. She is the sort of girl who is a honeypot for men. She's cute and funny and attractive and vivacious. I was a little annoyed, but felt like I shouldn't be at 30. It was a crush, after all. The things teenagers have. And he's his own person. I tried to move on.\n\nAnyway, they broke up after 3 months as she wasnt that sexually attracted to him, although they are still texting. He keeps trying to distance himself and asked for time away, but then she pulls him back in. At his birthday, she interrupted any conversation me and Dan were having alone with a flirtatious touch. He would turn away and then talk to her. At that point, I really wanted to just let go. Fuck that?\n\nI should have moved on, but I'm sure there has always been chemistry. It just isn't the kind thar burns buildings down. It's a slower, kinder sort of chemistry. He helped with my mums birthday and my family adored him. He adored my mum, and said so. I\n\nI havent been attracted to anyone else since July. I swear post-25 its so hard to feel truly attracted to people regularly. But I feel like now I can not make a move. However I am DYING to find out if he's attracted to me or not so that I can move on with my life.\n\nDo I wait it out? Make a move before he finds someone else? Me and my friend now both go to the same weekly class he's always at, but that's the only time i see him. I never see him alone. \n\nIm aware I'm risking a friendship, but equally, I feel like it was quite a short term relationship and I really feel something here. I also lost respect for my friend since the event, but also noticing a general pattern of priorotising male attention  over everything else - even if she's not interested in a relationship with the men. She has difficulty maintaining relationships with women because of this and I am her only close female friend locally (I moved here mid pandemic). \n\nI could confront her first, but I do feel like if she knows I'm going to shoot my shot, she will decide that she likes him again.\n\nIf I tell him how I feel, it might get back to her eventually. \n\nI could give it more time, but what if he meets someone else while im waiting for the time to be right? \n\ntldr My friend dated Dan for 3 months, knowing i had feelings for him. They broke up after 3 months. It's now been 2 months since the breakup. Do I make my feelings known to both of them?",

I recognise that I am in very privileged setting, and I do love my job :)\n\nOur school is expanding,  and we will be opening up a JK-1 group for classes starting in September. My boss has asked me to go and teach my kindergarten programme to them.\n\nI really enjoy teaching this age group of students (most days! üòÜ), and so adding their classes to my schedule would mostly be fun! Except...\n\nI have anxiety,  so these are the current concerns my brain is obsessing over:\n\n1. My boss has worked really hard with me to accommodate said anxiety.  I work part time,  and she checks in often to see if I'm becoming overwhelmed. This year was the first year since my anxiety has been stable enough for my co-workers to notice.  I kinda don't want to mess with a good thing.\n\n2. I have space to add these classes to my schedule and maintain my current classes (JK-6), but I worry about having the mental space. \n\n3. If maintaining isn't good for goofy brain,  then I should drop classes, to maintain a balanced schedule so I can better maintain a good relationship with my anxiety. \n\n4. BUT WHICH OF MY BABIES DO I GIVE UP.\n\n*sigh* \n\n5. I wanted to enjoy my sanity for the first time since PPA kicked my ass 10 years ago a little longer, yanno? I wanted to maintain this healthy balance,  stay in stasis for a while and just... enjoy a healthy (ish) brain. It's been hard earned. The pull of inertia is currently quite alluring. I'm resenting this change, dammit.\n\nTL/DR: changes to current job are rousing slumbering anxiety",

Yes, I have a lot to be thankful for, I have an apartment, a job, a dog, I live in a safe &amp; peaceful country, but I feel alone and lacking the human contact that I so long for. \n\nI've been dating since I was 17, I was married once, I try to be nice and caring, I make money and take care of myself, I look attractive on good days, but I feel like life just chewed me up and spit me out. Every day I have less energy, and no close friends and no one to talk to. \n\nI lost my mom a year ago, and now my dad's health is showing serious signs of decline. He's on the other side of the world. I feel so sad that my marriage did not work out, and I'm now stuck taking care of my dad all by himself, with no family of my own, no money to make things easier, etc. I talked to the guy I'm dating at the moment yesterday and just cried all night. \n\nI keep wondering why everyone around me is paired up, or has other support systems, and I'm just stuck. Yes, I made a lot of huge life changes (like moving countries 3 times), yes I'm an introvert who struggles to make connections, yes, I am not good at communicating or understanding my needs, yes, I have a lot of family trauma baggage, but I still just feel like I've been working real hard on resolving those things while people somehow cruise through life and end up in a cushy house &amp; good group of friends &amp; a stable relationship.",

        "text": "I am not looking for medical advice! Merely want to harvest some suggestions and what to look for...\n\nLately I have had an odd allergic reaction to something I've eaten, drank, or perhaps used on my body. \n\nI do eat out often, but as far as I know, I'm not allergic to any specific foods or food groups. The last time I had a reaction like this, it was narrowed down to eating at ChiChi's, which has been gone for almost 2 decades now. At least where I live. And the only thing we could even think was the cause was the red dye on the tortilla strips. As it was basically something I'd not had prior to this instance.\n\nThe only other change I have made, chemically speaking, was a brief stint using Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner on my hair. That lasted about 3 days, since it didn't do my hair any good üòÜ\n\nOther than winter skin, and the use of driveway heat on my back porch, there has been no other changes that I am aware of. \n\nI live alone, but have an SO who stays on weekend. I work in an office alone, but people do come in occasionally. Critters have been ruled out. I have a cat, who's critters have also been ruled out üôÇ\n\nSo as far as eating and drinking go, what could possibly be some triggers for a random allergic reaction? I realize every person is different. This isn't a medical emergency, as it's just randomly itchy spots. Nothing is swelling or otherwise in need of medical attention. It's just annoying and making me crazy that I can't think of a cause.",

        "text": "I've never posted here and I almost can't believe I'm about to spill some secrets with strangers but here goes nothing.\n\nI am 30F, dating 30M for almost a year. Things have been really fantastic and I definitely see a future with this person. He is emotionally intelligent, supportive, kind, funny, and most importantly, we are best friends. We spend most of our time together, have met each other's friends, families, and we have a few trips planned in the next few months (so there is future planning happening). \n\nThe conversation about a future is a difficult one for him because he was previously in an 8 year relationship that ended after they got engaged and then things fell apart. He acknowledges that he \"dodged a bullet\" by not marrying that person and that he knew at the time for years in the relationship that they probably weren't right for each other but breaking up was so hard (it was his first gf). He was single for 2+ years before he met me and spent some time casually dating, he has been in therapy for years (including while still being in that previous relationship), and knows he has a ton of commitment issues. It took a while for us to become \"official\" when we first started seeing each other because of his fear of commitment, but as far as our actual relationship goes, everything is great. We communicate really well, understand each other, and are a great team.\n\nWhen I ask him if he sees a future with me, his answer is along the lines of \"I don't see a future. It's not that I don't see a future with you, I just don't see anything beyond 2-3 months out. I made plans for a future with someone and that didn't end up working out and now I struggle with seeing any future for myself further than a few days or weeks away\". I should mention he also has anxiety which he takes medication for and has periods of depression. He is super communicative with me about all these feelings and emphasizes that it's not about me, it's about his inability to see a future for himself at all. I completely sympathize with that and have tried the entire time we've been together to help him work through those dark thoughts.\n\nBut we've now been together for a year and I still don't have any firm reassurances from him that he sees a future with me. We've had frank conversations about things we both want: marriage, kids. He knows that for me, that is something I am more concerned with because I unfortunately have a biological clock ticking. I wish I didn't need to think about things like timelines, but I feel anxious not knowing if this person is seeing a long term future with me the way I am about them.\n\nBasically, what do I do? Do I stay with this person and hope they figure out what the future looks like? I know we both feel very happy in the relationship and we ultimately want the same things in life, we talk about that a lot. But he definitely wants to take things slower than I do, which I understand. \n\nShould I be stressed about my age and biological clock? I love this person and want it to work but I am also coming to terms with the idea that maybe he's not in the same place I am. I don't want to push him into something he isn't ready for. \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Hello, I‚Äôm 36, I‚Äôve had severe itching on my right breast for a few months. It started on the outside of the breast and it came and went. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until the itching spread to the entire breast. I‚Äôve never had any itching on the left. I will add that I got saline breast implants in 2016. I had a little itching at the incision site right when I got them but I was told that was normal. The itching I‚Äôm experiencing now is different. It‚Äôs an itch I can‚Äôt seem to get to if that makes sense. I haven‚Äôt changed anything like detergents, soaps, lotions, or deodorants. I don‚Äôt have any rashes either. \n\nI have some discoloration on my breast as if I‚Äôve been out in the sun, but I have not been to any topless beaches so these girls haven‚Äôt gotten much sun. Lol\nI am having some leakage from my nipples. Well the right leaked once but with pressure I could get some fluid out of the left. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I stopped breastfeeding 5 months ago. I struggled to produce so much that I had to take a prescription to help me increase. So when I stopped breastfeeding I dried up quickly. I know moms can have residual milk production in their breasts for up to a year, but I thought it was strange that it happened months later and after I struggled so much before I fully dried up. It could definitely be milk. What comes out is slightly white, some drops of clear, and yellow. So not sure if it‚Äôs milk or discharge?\n\nMy right breast does look slightly bigger than the other. Which again, most women have one bigger and that‚Äôs normal. I can‚Äôt seem to remember if that one had always been that way? I am wanting to think this is nothing serious.  However, my pcp sent a referral to the local breast care center for a closer look and for an MRI. My appointment wasn‚Äôt until the 14th with the breast care center, but when I clarified what was going on the woman who scheduled it spoke to the doctor and was asked to make it sooner for the 7th. \n\n I‚Äôve had some pains and aches in the affected breast but I‚Äôm also wondering if I‚Äôm just now being hypersensitive to anything that‚Äôs happening. I don‚Äôt want to assume anything because I feel like I‚Äôm going to feel rather silly when it‚Äôs nothing. I am having more increased itching as the days go by but I would of expected my breast to be making some super noticeable changes if it was a cancerous issue right? I guess I‚Äôm just impatient to just figure this out and move past it as well.\n\nThoughts? Any other women have similar experiences?",

That is it.\n\nRelationship is... I dunno. He wants to get married and I feel very fucked up about it all. I care about him, but sometimes I feel like he's making a bad choice. Also the idea of planning a wedding right now holds zero appeal to me. Technically it's always had zero appeal to me, but my tolerance for it is particularly low right now.\n\nFriends are distant or gone. \n\nIt seems like I'm sick all the time these days. Stomach problems, sinus infection, allergies, restless leg. It's always *something*. I just want to get a single solid night's sleep without my body doing... whatever it's doing. And eat. I'd like to be able to eat. Hell, I actually *enjoy* exercise, but I haven't been able to for the last three weeks because *I'm fucking sick again.* It's just a series of little stuff. No one takes it seriously. But it's constant.\n\nI tried therapy and meds in the past. It was a mess dealing with insurance and billing. I can't pay for this stuff out of pocket. I gave up. Managing everything was conversely making me feel worse. \n\nI can't see past all this. My life's not even that hard. I have no idea how anyone gets through their day. What am I looking forward to? Nothing. I'm too tired. Does that mean I'm looking forward to sleep? No, because my legs are going to thrash all around and I'm going to cough myself half to death in the process of trying.\n\nI've always been prone to depression, but I do think once you get older, there's a sort of realization that yes, it is in fact always going to be like this. This is life. Welcome to it.\n\nAnyway, if you read my ramble, thanks. What would you do?",
