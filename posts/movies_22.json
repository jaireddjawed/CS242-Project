        "text": "So it seems that the long awaited, anticipated but delayed sequel to the 80s classic \"Beetlejuice\" might be finally set to getting a sequel after all this time. Tim Burton, Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder have stated they are excited to work on the sequel, and that Tim Burton misses the anti hero/villainous character Beetlejuice but wanted to make sure it was a proper script/narrative to get the film made. \n\nJenna Ortega is in talks to star as Lydia(Winona Ryders) daughter in the upcoming sequel, \n\nHopefully they can get Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, and even Catherine O'Hara back as their respective roles too. \n\nMy biggest concern is if it will be more comedy than how it was in the original, given how creepy and unsettling the original film had within moments throughout the storyline. \n\n\nThey need to in my opinion keep the edgy, adult humor and fun special effects to make it feel like a proper sequel. \n\nThere have been reports that the film is ready to start the film production by late May of this year\n\n\n\nHow do you feel about an upcoming sequel? Are you going to be excited for Michael Keaton back as the Ghost With the Most?",

It's a wonderfully slow, psychological thriller that left me thinking I figured everything out only for me to change my mind ten minutes later. Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain is not a pairing I would think of it at all, but it just works.\n\nAnyone else seen this movie? What's your take on the ending - is it real, or not real? I think it's another vision, but curious as to others' thoughts. It's pretty obvious the entire movie is a metaphor for mental illness, so I was taking the ending figuratively, but I think it's definitely valid to see it as literal as well.",

Seems like he or his legal team went to measures to remove it as best as they could for that reason.. the internet and media was still relatively basic back then that it would be easier than today. It was a straight to tv/vhs movie so parents never bought it nor were they forced to see it so they wouldn’t know or remember and kids after it was removed wouldn’t know it either. \n\nIf you remember it, you’re not crazy.",

We have corporations talking a big game in public about how they support women only to make profits by abusing low income people (including women). \n\nWhat movie calls these people out and truly mocks their hypocrisy?

Every sequel has the same basic formula as the original, the story changed a bit, maybe there's some new characters, maybe it's in a new setting, but bottom line it's the same basic formula.\n\nSo it got me thinking...

        "text": "With the news of Jacob Elordi playing not one but two gay characters in buzzworthy films this year (*On Swift Horses, Saltburn*), I've seen a lot of people bringing this topic up again. At least since the days of *Brokeback Mountain*, the conversation about non-LGBT actors receiving critical acclaim for playing LGBT characters has been a sensitive one in moviegoing circles. \n\nThe argument usually centers around the idea that cis/straight actors are taking opportunities away from queer actors who are all too often usually pushed to the side and relegated to non-leading roles across film and television. It used to be the death of an actor's career to come out, whereas a straight actor could take on a gay role with no detriment to their career, and often to critical or commercial success (Sean Penn in *Milk*, Colin Firth in *A Single Man*, Cate Blanchett in *Carol,* etc). A very recent example, of course, being Nick Offerman in *The Last of Us.*\n\nSince the days of *Brokeback Mountain*, however, we have thankfully seen more and more out LGBT actors have great careers (if not even better after coming out) -- something that was unthinkable a couple decades ago. We have also seen LGBT actors play cis/straight roles to great critical or commercial success as well (Matt Bomer in *White Collar,* Neil Patrick Harris in *HIMYM*, Jim Parsons and Sara Gilbert on *The Big Bang Theory*, etc.). \n\nDo you believe that non-queer actors playing queer roles should be a non-issue these days? Or would you rather see a Hollywood in which queer actors play queer characters, and these roles stop going to those who aren't?",

It was pretty much Simple Jack gone full retard. \n\nIt actually made a lot of money and gave Jodie Foster a Oscar nomination (II) but it's such a hammy, overdone, cliched performance and I remember cringing at it. And it's dated as H if you see it now. Thank god Jessica Lange won that year for BLUE SKY, a movie that was shelved for 3 years. Because Jodie would have won if not for Lange.",

However, for future films (excluding Folie a Deaux), here’s who i believe would be great in the role: \n1. Adam Sandler: i know it’s a crazy answer, but he has delivered some crazy good drama performances (Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Click, Uncut Gems) and also has the comedic mannerisms to pull off a character such as this. \n\n2. Pete Davidson: has the tall, lanky build of Joaquin Phoenix, along with many facial features that resemble the character well. He has potential to show a more dramatic side, as he did so in King of Staten Island. \n\n3. Johnny Depp: aside from the recent Amber Heard scandal, he has shown that he can take any character and roll with it. \n\n4. Timothee Chalamet: younger, but a very talented actor who i feel can fit very well \n\nI’d like to hear what you guys think would play this character the best. And let’s be real, literally anyone would do better than Jared Leto did. What a disaster that movie was…",
