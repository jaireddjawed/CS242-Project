        "text": "So I stumbled across the following riddle:\n\nSanta orders that all houses must be decorated with green and red lights. The elves begin to do as Santa said. One elf manages to find 8 lamps that he used for previous Christmas. He knows that there are exactly 4 red lamps and 4 green lamps, but the problem is that he is colorblind and can't distinguish the lamps from each other. Luckily he has a device that tells whether 2 lamps are red or not. If the elf puts 2 red lamps in the device, it makes a sound and the elf knows which color the lamp is. If he puts 1 green lamp and 1 red lamp in the device, it doesnt make a sound. The same is true for 2 green lamps.\n\nNow on to the question: How many times does the elf have to put a pair of lamps in the device in order to make sure the device is going to make a sound the next time he puts a pair of lamps in it?\n\nAnswers (multiple choice):\n\n1. 4\n2. 5\n3. 6\n4. 7\n5. 8\n6. 9\n7. 10\n8. 14\n9. 16\n10. 28",
