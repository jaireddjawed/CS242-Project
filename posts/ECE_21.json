Failed math and science, etc. After failing senior year, I didn't go back to school making a drop out. But for a while I've been aching to educate myself with electrical engineering. This seems like a laughable impossible goal given that I didn't even graduate high school but I want to try. I want to know if there is such a thing as reliable resources for beginners. Should I pursue this or give up?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses. Reading your comments has really pumped up my motivation and I'm determined to get my GED and work hard to learn about electrical engineering and get my degree. Thank you all so much!",

What is cute word that combines transistor with LED?\n\nThis would be useful with free space optical communication, when LED has to switch up to 100 million times per second to transmit bits. For example, use that component in a 1000 lumen flash light in full power and when using it to communicate kilometers away in focused beam, lumens are less than half. Or a drone could use illumination lights to transmit video of the illuminated ground under it.\n\nMaybe also for nanobots and microbots, those hypothetical integrated circuits that can swim inside humans to cure diseases... They may use tiny lamps with their sensors to determine what to do.\n\nAlso, how about combination of capacitor + transistor?\n\nEDIT:\n\nIsn't flash eeprom cell, storing one bit, already a kind of hybrid of capacitor+transistor?\n\n.\n\n\nTransistor + light sensor could mean individually adjustable sensitivity for 1-bit camera pixels, which would be strange way to take pictures...\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is vague tossing around of thoughts / ideas, not asserting of claims or opinions.\n",

        "text": "I have an unusual situation that I am hoping this subreddit can provide some insight for. This is related to a reverse power relay that was part of a startup for a job. I encountered some unusual behaviour and while I was able to get the relay working I would like to confirm my suspicion and also find someone who can actually do the math. A decade or more ago I took negative/zero/positive sequence voltage coursework but honestly I am not going to be able to relearn that by Monday to the degree needed to prove everything out mathematically so here I am.\n\nSo the system I was setting up was fairly simple. It consisted of a reverse power relay that had a three phase voltage input and a single phase current input. The current was supplied by a 600:5 CT and the voltage was fed by an open delta 600:120 PT with B\\-phase grounded.\n\nTo test the reverse power relay I planned on simply swapping the CT leads and therefore cause the relay to think the power is flowing in the opposite direction. The test failed. I checked everything, all wiring was correct.\n\nThen I started looking at the reverse power relay wiring examples in the relay’s manual and they all clearly show that the phase angle between each phase should be 120 degrees as per normal ie; they come right off the bus. But in my case that PT is being used to go from 600V to 120V, probably for safety. Since this is open delta transformer is in actuality giving a 60 degree phase shift between the A and C phase \\(I can’t measure B because it is grounded\\) when measured to ground.\n\nI then realized that in the factory they probably test these only with a clockwise / ABC phase rotation \\(I confirmed this is the case\\) and the fact that this system is using a CBA rotation might throw things off with how the relay calculates power flow and direction badly enough to cause it not to function \\(I realize it is probably throwing it off under normal circumstances too\\). So thinking that is a possibility but honestly \\(sucking up my ego here\\) due to my math skills for this particular problem literally being over a decade out of practice I just figured the best way to test this theory was to flip the B and C phase input to the primary site of the PT. Lo and behold the relay now worked.\n\nI guess my question is, am I crazy? Can anyone do the math for this and show exactly why what is happening is happening? I can visualize it but that doesn’t translate to email very well. I suppose worst case I am going to have to get out my old books! Thanks in advance. Also if there are other subs this might be better for I am all ears.",

The fields that really impact the world, not just consumer electronics. I would be also interested in ANALOG IC for those applications (eg. circuit design for a satellite).

Whereas i am finding that the signal processing side of things is in-home. I want to be in the center of where these applications are developed (eg. Department of Defense and not a small company that develops the circuits for the DoD).\n\nWhat I'm not interested in is RTL, Verilog, FPGA programming. I'm more into analog IC design (amplifiers, etc) and not digital (eg. logic synthesis, timing analysis). So for example, I would be interested in the analog circuitry for a satellite or radar or a weapon system, or signal processing side of things, since analog IC is outsourced.\n\nSo what is the best field to specialize in if I decide to do a Master's?

Unfortunately the cyclone II FPGA on the DE2 board only supports LVDS up to 2.5V and my IO bank is wired to 3.3V.\n\nI'm assuming there's something fundamental to the LVDS hardware inside the FPGA that won't work (read: explode) if I try and put a 3.3V signal into it.\n\nMy design won't synthesise because of this:\n\n    Error (169029): Pin DATA_VOLT_IN_DIFF is incompatible with I/O bank 5.  Pin uses I/O standard LVDS, which has a VCCIO requirement incompatible with that bank's VCCIO setting or its other pins that use VCCIO 3.3V.\n    \n    Info (169073): Pin DATA_VOLT_OUT in I/O bank 5 uses VCCIO 3.3V\n    Info (169073): Pin SW[1] in I/O bank 5 uses VCCIO 3.3V\n    Info (169073): Pin SW[0] in I/O bank 5 uses VCCIO 3.3V\n\nI could tell Quartus II that actually that IO bank is 2.5V and change all IO standards to be 2.5V compatible.

[Something like this](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SimpleAudioPlayer) but they use arduino due, which has a built-in DAC and the library they're using is made for that I believe. I'm set out to accomplish this using arduino UNO (which doesn't have a DAC) but I have some queries. \n\n- Do I actually need a DAC circuit be it using a DAC chip or a resistor-ladder circuit to convert the audio samples into an analog, which is then amplified or it could be done without the use of DAC as well?\n\n- How do you go about encoding the audio sample bits? Is there any program that does it?\n\n- Do I really need to use an external audio library like [this one](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Audio/blob/master/src/Audio.cpp) or I'm better off without it?\n\n\n",

I graduated from a small countryside university with a BE degree in computer engineering back in 2016. I felt that I was lagging behind in my final year and then I tried to catch up by studying by myself, but I am not sure if that helped at all. \n\nIn the beginning of 2017 I've got a job and moved to another state. At that job it was ok, because most of the work was just writing code that didn't require that much knowledge or expertise. But this changed when I moved to this new job. The product is very high\\-tech and people I work with all got their degrees from top brazilian universities. When we're having lunch together and they talk about their education I feel like I had no education at all, given the disparities in quality. \n\nDuring work I try everything to not need help, but it's almost impossible because of the nature of the product. And with that comes the feeling that people will find it out and I'll end up being kicked out.\n\nI was trying to map the areas that I am most deficient in and it will almost always be in the electrical side of the degree: electronics, analog circuits, circuit analysis and design, control, signal processing and so on. It also happens with the computing side but with less intensity. Overall, when I think of a course I took I can remember some of the main topics in it but with none or little depth. \n\nWell, this has been cause of  a lot of anxiety lately. When I think about going through all the material again it seems a very daunting endeavour and I can't stop thinking that maybe I won't understand these things ever. Part of coming here to write this post is to try think this situation better and maybe get some help from you. \n\nJust a couple of books from uni remained and they are not on the fields that I need. Maybe some of you could suggest a bibliography or something else with the core of ECE to help me out.\n\nThanks for your time",

We accelerated a convolution algorithm by implementing custom instructions that utilized concepts like SIMD and \"fusion\" (fusing multiple instructions into one). \n\nI was surprised to see just how easy it all was. For those of you who don't know how the Xtensa processor works, you start with their base processor, and their IDE allows you to define custom instructions with their proprietary HDL. When you implement your instructions, you're given a header file containing C-callable functions that you just insert into your code. \n\nI feel like they took what is usually an incredibly complicated process (designing custom chips) and simplified it greatly, so I'm curious why I haven't heard of these configurable processors up until now.  I looked at their customer profile for this processor, and it looks like a number of companies are using their IP to create custom processors to accelerate different things in enterprise products (i.e. cisco is using them in some of their routers). I really enjoyed this lab and I would love to do similar work after I graduate, but how is this kind of thing typically done in industry? \n\nIs this a big market? or is hardware acceleration mostly done by building custom chips from the ground-up through traditional means?

But since I want to make a piano (just one octave) how do I code it in C to manage / change the frequencies?? \n\nC - 523 Hz\nB - 494 Hz\nBb - 466 Hz\nA - 440 Hz\nAb - 415 Hz\nG - 392 Hz\nGb - 370 Hz\nF - 349 Hz\nE - 330 Hz\nEb - 311 Hz\nD - 294 Hz\nDb - 277 Hz\nC - 262 Hz\n\nI'm referencing off Jonathan Valvano's website since he uses the same micro controller, but I do not understand how he is able to output different frequencies in his code. \n\nhttp://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/C13_DACSound.htm\n\nHis sample code is near the bottom of that page. Any help, links, tips would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!!",

        "text": "Hello /r/ECE\n\nI'm working on a project which uses a ucontroller with four 3v3 uart ports. I need to be transmitting and receiving at 750k baud (old, proprietary hardware being converted from dual-line to TTL through an FTDI chip). We're running a lightweight linux distribution called Armbian. Due to OS constraints, we cannot consistently set custom baud rates through stty commands, nor can we seem to get a C driver working to modify the ospeed and ispeed through /asm/termios.\n\nI can, however, take a POSIX accepted baud rate which is higher than our required 750k and clock it down, so to speak, right?\n\nExample, if I have 921,600 baud as an accepted baud rate which can be natively configured with our OS, but then clocked the serial clock down to a level where 921,600 is actually 750k baud, would that work?\n\nI'm using the formula (base serial clock speed/higher accepted baud setting) * (desired baud setting) to get the new, slower serial clock speed that I'll need to use.\n\nI'm sorry if my question is poorly worded, I'm pretty new to serial communications and wanted to know if this type of work around is feasible.\n\nThanks!\n",

        "text": "Hey everyone, first time poster here. Been lurking for a while and I enjoy this sub. I posted this over at r/EngineeringStudents as well. \n\nSkip to the part that is bolded if you don't care about the background information and want the immediate concern of mine. \n\nAnyways, I'm currently enrolled at my local community college, just turned 21, and am graduating with an Associates in Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing, which was a two year program there, once this spring semester is over. The classes for it are almost what you'd take your first two years of a 4 year program, but there are plenty of more focused classes you have the option of taking like strength of materials, circuit theory, dynamics and statics etc.\n\nI am transferring to Wentworth Institute of Technology for the Fall 2018 semester, and working towards an electrical engineering bachelors there. I'm very excited and am really looking forward to all of it. \n\nThe classes I have taken are: \n\nSemester 1\n\n- College algebra\n- Intro to engineering\n- English comp 1\n- COL101 (I forget what it was even called to be honest)\n\nSemester 2\n\n- Precalculus\n- General Chemistry\n- Intro to Robotics\n- Human Communication\n\nSummer semester\n\n- Macroeconomics\n- Calculus 1\n\nSemester 3\n\n- Calculus 2\n- University Physics 2\n- 3D Mechanical Design and Analysis 1 (CAD stuff)\n- Statics\n\nWinter intercession\n\n- Microeconomics\n\nSemester 4 (current spring 2018 semester)\n\n- Calculus 3\n- Differential Equations\n- University Physics 2\n- 3D Mechanical Design and Analysis 2\n\nEverything looks fine and dandy I'm sure there. This current semester I have a B or better in all the classes I'm taking, with an overall GPA of 3.5. \n\n**MY CONCERN**\n\n*Disclaimer: The Physics professor at my college is very nice, he's fun to talk to and interesting. I have nothing against him other than the way he runs his class.*\n\nIt all boils down to the University Physics 1 and 2 classes I have taken/am taking. I hate saying this, but to me, the classes are both a joke and not worth the time, and money. The way the class was ran for University Physics 1 was the first two weeks we like, read these random quotes and short stories about physics, and why it's interesting, but it was all this cryptic stuff that to me, did not matter one bit to physics. I felt like I was in a Physics based English class. After that, we kind of started to do actual physics, it was very basic stuff where we had to look at a real system and analyze things that are happening in it. My major issue with this class was that our professor literally, I mean literally, never lectured a single minute. The beginning of class he basically explained the worksheet we'd do that day for 5 minutes, if that, and let us just try to do it. Everyone felt like they just got tossed into shark infested waters and we had to fend for ourselves and learn all this on our own, which was true, except the way the class was ran dropped our morals and a lot of students didn't care. I talked to others in the class and they feel the exact same way. Oh also, our only grades are a test, a final, and participation. The tests are both totally open book, open notes, open computers, open talk to ANYONE in the room. I think that's total crap. I saw multiple people copy stuff down from the internet, or others, and they get a 100 on it. I ended up with an A, and I wasn't even happy about it because I didn't earn it. I busted my ass in calc 2 and got an A- and I was very happy with that. When our professor grades the papers, I feel like he doesn't look at the work, there's no marks anywhere, even if something is wrong (I'll get to that in the next part). We just see 10/10 written on the back, and it's only a few questions we have to answer. \n\nUniversity Physics 2 is basically the exact same. We still do not go over anything in the book as a class, where a lecture should occur. So far the only difference is that we didn't read random Physics quotes in the first two weeks of the semester. We have had one test so far, and I got a 10/10 on it, cool. Except I purposely answered a question wrong so I don't get an A for both physics courses, I might sound wrong for this, but I feel like getting perfect grades for physics classes is really difficult, and I'm not the type of person to want to get a grade handed to me. I was surprised to see my professor didn't grade me incorrectly and it made me feel like he doesn't care if we know the material or not. I just feel like I'm wasting my time and money, and I feel like I was cheated out of learning physics, something I've always been passionate about throughout my life. I have no desire to go to class and attend, but I do it anyways because it's just rude to not show up. Plenty of kids skip out on a weekly basis. \n\nSoooo, as someone going for electrical engineering, who has not learned the material to the extent I should have in University physics 1 and 2, am I screwed? Should I take them at Wentworth? \n\nTLDR: I have not even come close to learning material covered in physics 1 and 2 due to the way the professor handles the classes. He doesn't lecture, and gives very little background information to us before we start our in class work. He seems to hand out A's to students (happened to me) while the students don't really know much. One more piece of information, the way grading works is this, 1 test, and a final, and participation grading. The test and final are open book, notes, computers, and even the people around you. Most people just copied each other and called it a day and got 10/10's. Am I screwed for electrical engineering, as a transfer student from a community college? I know my calculus well I feel if that matters. ",

This I'm confident with.\n\nThe loop antenna however has me stumped. One book suggests that it is sensitive to the electrical field across it, and so introduces a 90 degree phase shift in the output current. Wikipedia claims that it is sensitive to the magnetic field, and implies the resulting current is in phase with the magnetic, and therefore electric fields.\n\nI'm assuming the electric and magnetic fields are in phase, as they're transmitted from a vertically polarized source.\n\nDoes anybody know what the phase of the current output actually is?\nThanks!\n\nEdit: [This is my thinking behind a 90 degree phase shift.](https://i.imgur.com/RDzcE9Y.png)",

While hardware is something I want to work with I'd also like programming to be something I do on a regular basis in my future. Is there any chance I won't be able to work with software if I go into embedded systems? I'm afraid of only getting to work in VHDL and never doing software things like device drivers and other low-level programming.\n\n2. Do you get to develop algorithms as an Embedded Engineer or is your job solely to design the processing unit while other engineers get to do the algorithms/software which then is implemented on the processing unit?\n\n3. How broad of an area does embedded systems cover? For some reason I only think of processors when I think of embedded systems but can you also work with things like visual displays (computer monitors, TV monitors), routers, traffic light control systems or smart household devices?\n\n4. How much use will I have of the calculus courses I've taken? I enjoyed the math courses I took as an EE and would these courses be useless in a career of embedded systems?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post :)",

One company offered me a position and the raise in pay from my current position to the offer would be ~5%. There is room for negotiation, but I feel like this difference is not worth leaving my current position for. Am I being too greedy, or is this something you’d say is typical?",

        "text": "I have an internship offer (this will be my second internship) for a fairly well-known and prestigious company. This will have to be in the fall semester however, and will require me to drop that semester. It is in a industry/field that I am very interested in. \n\nHowever, after speaking with some faculty advisers on how this will affect my graduation dates etc, we found that it will delay my graduation by a year. I will end up graduating in 2020 instead of 2019. This same adviser also worked with this company before, and said that they don't really hire interns from my internship program. They only hire interns from their year-round internship program, which I'm not in. \n\nMy adviser felt that it would be in my best interest to drop the offer and focus on graduating on time. They argued that I'm essentially trading the pay/experience of actually working in the field as an actual engineer for the pay/experience of working as an intern. \n\nIn addition, I've also received a scholarship opportunity that pays just as much as the money I would make if I accepted the internship and worked that semester. However, this scholarship opportunity requires me to be a full time student, and therefore, I would not get it if I accept the internship offer.\n\nMoney-wise, either option I'll end up the same. However, I have two choices:\n\n1. Take the internship just so I could put down a really prestigious company on my resume, and delay my graduation.\n\n2. Turn down the internship and just graduate on time\n\nNormally, I think the first option would be the better one, but the scholarship + the fact that the company doesn't really hire interns from my intern program is making me lean towards the second option/choice. In addition, I do have an internship so it won't be like I'm graduating with no experience if take option 2. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Would I be competitive enough with just 1 internship? Or would being able to put the second internship's prestigious company on my resume be worth delaying my graduation? ",
