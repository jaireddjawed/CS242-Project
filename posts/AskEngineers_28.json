        "text": "In Circuit Analysis, we used complex numbers in the modeling of AC circuits. But my physics book is simply ignoring the imaginary components of anything. For example, instead of calculating the impedance (which is a quantity represented by a complex vector) of an inductor, my book only calculates it's reactance (the real component of the impedance).\n\nFrom what I can understand, using complex numbers is a way to deal with the phase shift between the current and the voltage, but having to ignore the imaginary component just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nI know that my book was written this way to simplify the math, but this made me question what I learned on the other chapters. If they just ditch the ***imaginary component* of *complex numbers*** and don't even mention it in the AC chapter, there's probably a lot of concepts that are either oversimplified or just plain wrong in the other chapters because whoever wrote the book decided to change it just because *the math was \"prettier\" this way.*\n\nI'm worried that I spent hours and hours of my life learning useless/wrong stuff from this book.",

This would put the side load forces from the crankshaft into the crosshead and where it contacts the block instead of the piston itself. There wouldn't be as much friction which means less heat loss and potential for the engine to rev higher. However, there would be reduced piston dwell time which might offset that benefit, also added weight even with smaller piston skirts could lead to a lower rpm than a traditional engine with a long rod. Even though the piston rod is adding length to the deck height, having much shorter but at higher angle conrods from the lack of need for a high rod ratio can mean an overall shorter deck height. These are just my ideas I'm not sure any of it is correct because I cant find much information online about crossheads and don't have any programs to test. Any information about them would be appreciated, Thanks.",

        "text": "Hi. First of all, I am grateful for anyone's advice. Second, I have obtained a B.E of mechanical engineering about 2 years, but, ever since, I kind of just stopped being interested in this field. I was very excited about building a career in mechanical engineering prior to and during uni, but I kind of now feel unmotivated and bored (It's probably because of my current job and the economic state of my country). \n\nMoving on, I have taken multiple programming during and after university, and I found them (especially the mobile app development ones) to be amazing and very exciting. Naturally, I am now wondering if I should pursue a degree in computer science. Obtaining it would open new job opportunities for me, but I am hesitant on what to do.\n\nAdditional info:\n1. The uni at which I studied M.E. told me that some credits could be transferred between the 2 degrees.\n2. I'm pretty sure I can get upwards of 80% tuition discount per semester, thus, lowering the tuition by a lot.\n3. There are more jobs in CS fields than in any other field right now in my country.\n\nSo my questions are:\n1. May you help me decide please?\n2. May anyone who completed a CS degree while maintaining a full/part time job share their experience please?\n\nThank you so much!",

Potentially to get a p.eng one day and also keep my options open as I’m not 100% sure what I want to do in the future. The best option for me is attending a local institute that offers two engineering programs that catch my eye, mechatronics and sustainable energy engineering. \n\nThe sustainable program is new and recently has gotten a lot of funding from the government and school, but I’m not really sure how good the curriculum is. The reason being is that the general advice I have found online recommends to follow a traditional engineering degree and specialize after. Unfortunately, this school doesn’t offer traditional paths. I do have an interest in this program but I don’t want to make the mistake of being pigeon holed in the future. Even though the program itself does set students up for success with 3 mandatory co-ops, Mechatronics seems like a safer option as I can figure out what I like more throughout my degree and focus on that after, such as mechanical or software/electronics. \n\nThis is the curriculum for the sustainable program: https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2023/spring/programs/sustainable-energy-engineering/major/bachelor-of-applied-science.html\n\nMechatronics for comparison: https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2023/spring/programs/mechatronic-systems-engineering/major/bachelor-of-applied-science.html\n\nShould I just stick with mechatronics? Or would the sustainable program be a good option even if I can’t land a sustainable related position right away. \n\nWould appreciate any advice, thank you \n\nTLDR: looking to choose mechatronics or sustainable energy engineering, interested in both with sustainable having the edge, worried that sustainable curriculum might pigeon hole me",

        "text": "So, I'm 15 and I'm not behind, I'm just struggling. I've never really been that good at math and I've always struggled with it probably due to some life struggles getting in the way of learning. But now I've gotten so interested in engineering (mechanical mostly. I find computer engineering fascinating though) but I worry. Is there no chance for me? I know that engineering is super hard and I want to work hard and study maths so I can be great but people tend to tell me that I can't \"be good at everything\" and that my strengths are in different areas like music. It kind of makes me worried that I shouldn't even think about something like engineering. But am I still young enough that if I dedicate myself and have enough passion I could do it? Sorry if this is a silly question. I just wanna hear opinions. Maybe someone has had a similar experience and could give their insight. Thank you if so.",

The problem I'm having is that the dowel breaks 30% of the time, which isn't acceptable. \n\nSo, how do I redesign the arm of my linear actuator to be able to support the dowel between the end of the arm and the edge of the object? \n\nMy first idea was to have two pieces: one at the edge that can extend out to the edge of the object, maybe pushed by an internal compression spring, and then the inner actuator rod that pushes the wooden dowel directly. Kind of like [this](https://imgur.com/a/FxeKzqG) with a spring on each side. \n\nSo, mechanical engineers: thoughts?",

        "text": "*My background:*\n\nI'm primarily a guy who is very good at computers, but I'm soon to be taking classes that have to do with Electrical engineering (I'm in Computer Engineering). I have taken Chemistry already, so I understand what electrons are, and I understand the fundamentals, like volts, ohms, amps, power.\n\n*The question:*\n\nOkay okay. I understand WHY this is. It was a misconception by Benjamin Franklin, who thought that the current was flowing the opposite way that it actually was. That was then corrected in the 1890s by Joseph Thompson. He discovered that electrons actually flowed from our conventional negative to our conventional positive. However, for some God-forsaken reason, we decided to double-down and keep teaching the wrong way, and that is just today's conventional standard.\n\nHere is what I don't understand: how in the Hell do our electronics still work the same way, regardless of which way the electricity works?? I understand that the equations don't actually call for direction of current, and so, they work anyway, but how about diodes?\n\nI can see with resistors this works fine, and shouldn't be a problem, but...\n\nDiodes block the flow of electrons in one direction, and allow them to flow freely the other way. They work up to their rating. Basically a one-way street.\n\nSo you're telling me diodes (which were properly invented after Joseph Thompson's discovery) actually do the opposite of what we conventionally say they do? This might work out in a simple circuit, but won't this cause a crap ton of issues in designing more complex circuits with more logic and dependencies involved? What am I missing here? Maybe it just does work fine and I don't have enough experience in complex circuits?",
