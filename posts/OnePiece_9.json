        "text": "My theory: Shanks is the \"coming soon\" legend who need Nika/Luffy to achieve a legendary goal that will benefit the WG and sustain its authority over the world. So, Luffy/Nika is just a tool, a key, to Shanks. Why Luffy? Because he's from the \"fated\" group and eat Nika DF.\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\nShanks is the real scenario writer in this manga. He's the intended \"lurking legend\" in One Piece. Consider these:\n\n1. Shanks gave the strawhat to Luffy.\n\n2. Strawhat seems very important to Im-sama.\n\n3. Shanks respect the WG authority structure and work anonymously with them\n\n4. Shanks maintain world peace (e.g., prevent WB to not pursue BB, stopping Kaido to enter Marineford War &amp; stop the war)\n\n5. Shanks stole gomu² no mi\n\n6. Shanks let Luffy eat the DF and protected him several times even by sacrifing his hand\n\n7. Shanks developed some of the key memories in Luffy early childhood\n\n8. Shanks asked Beckmen if it is the right time to claim One Piece\n\nFrom these we can conclude that Shanks is up to something at core of this manga, related closely to the WG and has an implicit link to the higher authority(ies) above WG. WG might not really know who Shanks is and what his vision-mission are.\n\nMarines also dont know about Shanks and his relation to WG (except Sengoku).\n\n\n\nNow, the WG. WG are just a bunch of observers of world politics and political servants for Im-sama. They, like Shanks, maintain the balance but, unlike Shanks, in more passive ways. Here are things we have known about them:\n\n1. They know gomu² no mi is nika DF\n\n2. WG surprised about nika DF comeback\n\n3. WG look at things at macro level (e.g., in earlier times they concerned with Luffy \"D\" initial, not what DF Luffy has)\n\n4. (Possibly) WG doesnt know who exactly stole the gomu² no mi\n\n5. They serve Imu directly\n\n\nThoughts?",

Why? Maybe his hairline has receded again? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8u4kh6lzrina1.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=653fcd11a25cac90437fb5b225796e73124c73c7\n\nAnd after the timeskip he wears a hat and we have never seen him without it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[yes on this picture we see him without his hat, but it seems to me that it is a refsheet of the gold movie. As we know, the films are not canon, so we can't rely on it](https://preview.redd.it/o7q4609isina1.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0739761bd061b3cf008ac06a3702363b2454b3d9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mjy2iixsina1.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=130ec5316c81d878b3c5811902793a11ebc5bbbe\n\n So here is my theory, this man is actually hiding a huge baldness, otherwise why would he wear such an ugly hat? It's the uniform you will say, it's his alibi to hide his baldness all that....",

This cover brings us back to [ch. 1068's cover](https://preview.redd.it/2v7jk26oyh3a1.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8b925557046a9a4909e1ef00c63e62970b102826) and completes the first loop of the chapter.\n\nNow, some of you will surely consider this the minorest among the minorest things I could pick at, but for me it's important: The exclamation mark.\n\nIn order for the panels of cover stories to feel like a cover and not a regular page of the manga, they treat text and speech bubbles in a special way. Text is avoided as much as possible and when it's used, it's never written in japanese, always in english. Regardless, almost all speech bubbles have pictures inside rather than text. Those pictures either are like \"a panel within the panel\" or an exclamation or question mark drawn, not typed, with a unique design.\n\nThe unique design always references the character they belong to. And for the most part, you could guess who the mark belongs to even without seeing the character. The ones in the pic below are all such marks used throughout the manga up to this chapter.\n\n[Unique exclamation and question marks from cover stories \\(yes, I went through the whole series to gather these\\)](https://preview.redd.it/t6dwig95rcna1.png?width=1534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=de56b5c8059873ba007a4dbf990e337aebb9b70d)\n\nThe ones in black &amp; white are from the current cover story and the two isolated to the bottom right are the one in this chapter and the one from chapter 1042. As you can see thesee two don't have a unique design. They're a regular question and exclamation mark respectively.\n\nThese are the facts and now you judge for yourself whether this for better or worse.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p2](https://preview.redd.it/4azm6ev2scna1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=34a9c48df93cc42382d05bcafa116946a9c15b91)\n\nSentōmaru starts this chapter by saying something rather sensible: \"This is going to get ugly, let's evacuate the island.\"\n\nBut the engineers working at Egghead have a better idea: \"Fuck survival. We demand answers! Tell us now before anything else.\"\n\nSo, in front of the disdain all of them have for their own life, Sentōmaru says: \"Ok. Gather round. It's story time. We'll risk our lives but the readers will get a refresher about something whose importance to be refreshed right now (or at all) is very debatable.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Sentōmaru gets a scene to do nothing and say mostly irrelevant stuff. Now we came back to that. The plot is looping.\n\nNotice how Oda keeps on taking advantage of every chance he has of rubbing onto our faces that Carrot is not a character any more no matter how we might miss her. See the man in an exo-skeleton with rabbit ears and the word rabbit written on it next to a girl that's basically Carrot with human ears and nose.\n\nMy honest opinion on this (and some other aspects, one of which I'll discuss later): At the beginning it felt like he was mocking us and now I feel like he's resentful towards us readers because there are so many that don't like so many of the latest developments. Like, we don't approve his writing, so he doesn't approve us and punishes us.\n\nAlso, this is a good chance to how unreliable anything the original manga writes in latin alphabet is. The label on the building, \"FABRIO\", the scanlator changed it. This is what was supposed to say and in fact, Shueisha's online version has changed it too. But the printed version says \"FABIRIO\".\n\n[Ch. 1077 p2 raw](https://preview.redd.it/5ikt5io5wcna1.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dff92f47486cb4a38b3e3036279a09d759c8a820)\n\nJust so you know that next time they write a romanized version of some character's name, they're likely messing something in it. As an example, remember how Impel Down's ex-vice-warden first was Shiryū, then Shilew, then Shiryū again. The Nefertari family name and Arabasta have also been written as inconsistently as possible in latin alphabet.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p3](https://preview.redd.it/qnk16fdwwcna1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ed6e17e893589fdfa641918a594b8cbaf2d1be47)\n\nSo, we get our very deserveed refresher because, remember, \"It's okay if you start reading One Piece during this arc\" (Oda Eiichirō disrespecting his own first 25 years of being a professional mangaka.)\n\nI hope we can all see how this page is the lamest attempt ever at trying to hype future chapters. The only point of this page is to tell the reader that (despite the recent chapters are going nowhere) in the near future something big is going to happen. Something very very big. The biggest ever. So, please keep reading until then.\n\nBut what is this \"big event\" exactly? We were told last chapter: A buster call of 100 ships. I'm not even going to discuss how surreal the number is. Okay 100 ships, fine. 10 times more ships than a regular Buster Call. One admiral. One of the Gorōsei. And I bet among those 100 ships there'll be less remarkable marines than in the Buster Call at Enies Lobby.\n\nAnd the reasoning behind it? Superb. We sent 10 ships to kill a group of scholars. Now we need to kill only one single person, how about we send 100 ships? Only a handful will get to the island's coast and be able to shoot at it, the others will be there being a nuisance to one another with a big chance of some of them hitting each other. So, overall, a very solid plan, right?\n\nWhy would we by hyped at 100 ships of which at most 3 will have a role and they're all going to be full of fodder?\n\n[Ch. 1077 p4](https://preview.redd.it/waf9rgycmdna1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=919ad7abcb9ba620499c99dd2d9352505da18401)\n\nMeanwhile, at A4F Luffy, Lucci, Zoro &amp; Kaku are... still fighting the seraphim just like last chapter? O\\_o Wait, what?\n\nWhy? Last chapter none of them used their stronger power ups and it would have been mildly justified IF and only IF that would have been enough to deal with the seraphim. Even if only to lose them for a while. But now the seraphim have returned, the situation is literally the same as last chapter before the team up and the plot keeps repeating itself.\n\nBoth couples do another combined attack, BUT... Excuse me, that's not Kong Organ. In Kong Organ, Luffy extends his arms to the sides and, somehow, he shoots his fists, biceps and shoulders frontally to hit 6 times at once. This is not what he's doing here.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p5](https://preview.redd.it/0zsd7gc8aena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=46432df317976961b2b481a1a0d554aa632f5f58)\n\nAnother whole page wasted in repeating what already happened last chapter.\n\nAnd now the complaint is totally legit. If you're not succeeding in the fight against the seraphim, and specially considering you're in a hurry to go help the others, why isn't Luffy using Gear 5th? Why Lucci and Kaku aren't using their awakening? Why isn't Zoro using.... His power up doesn't even have a name, does it? Let's just set one. Why isn't Zoro using his \"King of Hell\" thing?\n\nThey heard Nami scream because of the danger. I can't wait to read Luffy again saying he always goes all out. No, better. That he lives so that he has no regrets. Sure.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p6](https://preview.redd.it/pdz9933jbena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c4861138b60f99856ded17676f4968db0e4400f2)\n\nIf you think last page was bad, hold on tight. The attacks had no effect on the seraphims at all. And they kept on using attacks that had no effect. It's... I have no words...\n\nCentral panel takes half the page but the only thing it has is Luffy saying a random comment that contributes in no way.\n\nOr you could think that, but no. It has a purpose. It's all so that Zoro can make another random comment that thanks to Luffy's random comment, it doesn't come completely out of the blue. So, instead of having Zoro make a random remark just because, Oda sacrificed half the page to make Luffy do a random remark that makes Zoro's a bit less obvious.\n\nAnd for the end of the page, remember this: Shaka is surprised that a lunarian was part of Kaidō's crew.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p7](https://preview.redd.it/npk7pjafdena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=846a22dab1b36f8ceb47abca02c4b503e0bfcec2)\n\nThe very next panel, also Shaka: Well, if a lunarian were to be part of Kaidō's crew... I guess it must be that one lunarian who escaped Punk Hazard together with Kaidō and who happens to be the only lunarian known to be alive.\n\nHahahahahahahaha before reading this page I was going to say that for someone who's the world's most intelligent person and is aware of the relevant things, let's say, in his area of influence, not recognizing as a lunarian someone with black wings and a flame in the back despite those being half the distinctive features was awful. But WOW. The schizofrenia is real. One second he acts like he doesn't know shit and the next one he knows perfectly well.\n\nAnyway, Zoro tells the others about how the flame indicates supreme plot armor on the seraphims. Lucci appreciates the info, because now they can fight them.\n\nNo, Lucci you can't. Knowing they're invincible with their flames on doesn't give you any advantage. It's as easy as never puting the flames out and the fight is theirs. Specially considering you refuse to take the fight seriously.\n\nAnd now one of the highlights of the chapter: Zoro, who was always quite intelligent, becomes stupid for the sake of making a joke out of him. Nice. It's never too late to degrade the protagonists a bit more.\n\nHowever this moment is more important than it looks. At first, you'll think this is the moment that gives the chapter it's title \"You should've put it together sooner\". And in a sense, it's true.\n\nBut that's not the real meaning of the title. Remember how I said at the beginning there was another thing Oda does this chapter to be meanie with us? The title goes for us readers. He's telling us we should have solved \"the mystery\" already. You know what I'm talking about. The \"mysterious traitor\".\n\nHe's basically rejoicing in the fact that there's no way for us to know the answer because as long as he doesn't make it obvious in a chapter he can always change his mind. In fact, even if he had made it obvious he could change his mind and the manga. He's done it before. He retcon'd and axed the whole and sole development the character with the most screen time in Wano act III after Luffy had had. Yes I'm talking about Yamato.\n\nWhat Oda doesn't know, is that we don't care anymore. This slow, looping and non-interactive game of Cluedo is the most boring plot line One Piece has ever had and it's the only thing going on in this arc.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p8](https://preview.redd.it/xrja5hpwjena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=85891593d88e6eba8eba89d07533cd482c880d06)\n\nLast page looked heavy to you? Sit back, because this chapter goes in crescendo.\n\nCan you believe that the same way he didn't know about King and next panel he knew perfectly, Shaka's been clueless about the main body's whereabouts for several chapters and just now he remembers?? Are we really going to just let it slide?? 🤣🤣\n\nHe didn't know, until right now that he knows. Because plot convenience. But it's just getting started. We change setting to... look carefully, the floor immediately below, A3F. Nami is fighting S-Shark. But not without Oda putting his ass in front view. As I said some chapters ago, the current level of nonsense and lewd fanservice keeps making One Piece look less like One Piece and more like Fairy Fail.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p9](https://preview.redd.it/yvyt4cl4mena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8f338f04fd2e9246eaf004655b07cbc0f5448690)\n\nSo, while Nami fights the seraphim, Edison is destroyed and Brook is playing dead because... if the captain can stall, so can Brook, right?\n\nCorrection, Nami isn't fighting. Nami has a servant with part of Big Mom's powers that fights for her. But don't worry that S-Shark's flame was on, so he shouldn't have been damaged.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p10](https://preview.redd.it/3mk44osynena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8849c36ecfc60821eb8dec37d6d0904ba30cdbbb)\n\nOr he was. Ever since the most basic common sense left the manga, we can't be sure of anything no matter how obvious it could be.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p11](https://preview.redd.it/qqt5wx7dpena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a8bb023b26cc9b56f9b432adafed2ee3477a8615)\n\nProbably the best page of the chapter despite the ugly Sanji. Not only he does something we can relate to (Sanji's kick is the same Ivankov did to him before starting his training. It's also kind of Ivankov's trade mark. He had used it to others before, such as to Kuma at Marine Ford).\n\n[Ch. 595 p16](https://preview.redd.it/x6s9q2yoqena1.png?width=544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=065073f532336cd97250d98b97ed26172cba4f7d)\n\nAlso, Sanji wasn't with Nami's group. He was in a different floor in a different building. It's implied that he could also hear Nami's scream and, unlike Luffy or Zoro, he didn't hesitate to come help her.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p12](https://preview.redd.it/8n1ddb55rena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=01e38d908cc505a56b74c6c8c0f6519185547f41)\n\nWe change scene again and... Look!! Look who's fighting! Lilith.\n\nLast time we saw her, he hyped the seraphim in dispair telling Franky not to engage with S-Snake because there was no point. They had built them to be the most powerful beings. Now it's her who's fighting S-Snake with confidence. What changed? They were doing fine dodging laser beams.\n\nAlso, remember the Bubble gun? The gun that made bubbles that bounce everything. It sounded like a good defensive measure, right? Wrong. It doesn't bounce anything. It's kairōseki but in bubble form.\n\nSo, in the end, Lilith is confirmed to have been scamming us with her hype. She's doing quite fine against the S-Snake after all.\n\nAnd of course a couple more of female asses on display. Subtle. Really subtle, Oda.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p13](https://preview.redd.it/kx41muuysena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1fc2225bb647da335fb90a9f0d5366efd700c3b8)\n\nI love this page!! 100% filler. You can remove it, not read it, and the chapter remains the same. Nothing is lost.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p14](https://preview.redd.it/72sy6oy7tena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9798f181914bee33f89287db08fcd635b4d20a6b)\n\nHow long have we been without coming back in time? Yes. We loop back to the start of the fight. S-Snake shoots a laser everyone dodges with ease, etc. Then Franky traps the seraphim with the bubble. Great.\n\nNo. Wait! S-Snake activates her trump card the puppy eyes and it works!\n\n[Ch. 1077 p15](https://preview.redd.it/u2cdfz9xtena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12f66049f43dc4172ad88f4b8d9ec08be5f2b227)\n\nSAVAGE. This page would have been awesome 8 to 10 years ago when plot armor and plot convenience weren't as shameless as they are today, because here Franky and Usopp just got the closest they've ever been to death.\n\nBut you know they're not in danger, right? It's a good moment to reflect on to what extent has the manga lost the ability to create dramatic tension.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p16](https://preview.redd.it/6liy0ptwuena1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cc2e05bdbd640565bd27b0f156ede7ee40eb4729)\n\nLast change of setting. No Jinbe, Stussy, Robin, Chopper or Atlas this chapter. They're not in danger that we know of.\n\nUndergrund!! Shaka went all the way down passing through where Nami and Jinbe were fighting without a problem. Just saying. He also passed through where Robin, Chopper and Atlas are but didn't think it would be useful to tell them. It's not like they're searching for the Stella too.\n\nAnd the party starts.\n\n1. CP agents ask whether he's the one behind their imprisonment. Really? Don't they know who captured them?\n2. But Shaka is surprised!! It looks like we must believe he doesn't know a thing despite it was quite obvious in chapter 1068 and before that they knew perfectly well why the Cipher Pol had been coming to the island and that they were hostile. I'm sure at the very least CP0 weren't the first ones to tell them they were looking for other CP teams.\n3. Shaka's hunch was correct, I think some explaining about why did he suddenly know is in order.\n4. Stella asks Shaka who is it that's come with him. He's referring to someone that's not exactly there but upstairs. How much intelligence is required for noticing that someone hasn't actually come with Shaka? That he didn't bring the ither person here? I thought this was the most intelligent person in the world.\n5. This raises another question. Doesn't Stella know who put him in there either? Doesn't he know who beat him up? Why?\n\nWhy does no one know who is doing things to them?? Easy. Because otherwise it would be too much in our faces that the truth is being artificially hidden from us because if it wasn't these chapters wouldn't be telling a story at all. Just people running around for no reason.\n\n[Ch. 1077 p 17](https://preview.redd.it/7ghhj3362ina1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=28a93e8be2165a2e581cc86d8ba7522836bd72ee)\n\nAnd suddenly Shaka is shot in the head from upstairs. It's funny how the world's smartest person rather than alert Shaka about the suspicious individual hidden upstairs made a confusing question to him, so that Shaka were caught off guard by the shooter. Brilliant, as expected.\n\nAnd that was it. Piece of advice don't overthink too much about who might have shot Shaka. It could be S-Flamingo or S-Croc but it could also be someone we don't know (not that we know S-Flamingo either), it could be me, you, Luffy or even Shaka himself if Oda wants to when the time comes.\n\nFor now we're back to not knowing what's going on while Seraphims shoot lots of laser at the protagonists and all of them miss. Again.\n\nWell, at least we now know why CP0 brought S-Bear bak and called him a \"problem child\". Vegapunk said he built the most powerful beings but they can't even shoot accurately while someone there just shot Shaka's head in one try with a pistol. Of course, they weren't gettign enough funds from the government, bunch of scammers selling defective weapons.\n\nThat face of shock in Stella, do you see it? He never thought that level of accuracy was possible.",

While they are fighting, the conqueror's haki that she is passively putting out is knocking fodder out on the next floor and Usopp is claiming it's his but yet people say she wasn't using any coc or acoc. I know that Oda is inconsistent with his portrayal of haki but I have always worked under the assumption that yonko level fighters are always passively using some level of haki. And we know for a fact she was throwing around her conquerors during this fight so rather than assume \"she didn't use her acoc and if she did she would have no diffed\" I read the same chapters and assumed \"wow kidd and law are alot stronger and more durable than expected\"",

Judaism, Christianity and Islam depict her character as a cold woman, with circular yellow eyes that carries a [black sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah).\n\nI can go on and on about the shared traits between Sarahi and Mihawk but then we'd be here all day, I recommend going into her wiki to see how indepth it goes.\n\nSarahi, which is Zoro's fathers name shuffled Ihsara, has 6 letters.

His hardwork for a great foundation is one of the major reasons he is as strong as he is currently.

The only reason i think this would be a bad thing is because one of brooks themes is being grateful for his new life. So maybe a story about his past would either be really good or really bad. I know he's had amazing moments but i just want more i guess. Any thoughts on this hypothetical brook arc.",

        "text": "To be honest, not a lot on this theory, just felt we are possibly getting the reveal of the perpetrator(s) in the next chapter or two, so just wanted to bring up one last \"theory\".\n\nStella Vegapunk seems to briefly flash the powers of the clear-clear df and warp-warp df. Those two belong to Shiryu and Van Augur. I am aware that Judge and Queen's science was able to replicate this (being invisible by blending in with the surroundings), meaning Vegapunk should be able to as well. However, the warping mishap is interesting. I felt it was glossed over. Is this hinting that Vegapunk possibly experimented on Shiryu and Van Augur? or at least took their DNA/Lineage factors? Does that mean there was a possible transaction between BB and Vegapunk. Having the lineage factors for those two DF users, would definitely aid in exploring those powers for Vegapunk and his future creations.\n\nIf anything, i assume Vegapunk would be very interested in Blackbeard's body, at the least, and be curious in how he is able to be the user of more than one devil fruit. Vegapunk also showed interest in Luffy's Nika df, so there is curiosity in these bigshots. We're getting close to the reveal of the perpetrator(s) on Egghead, and i've always felt that BB pirates might be playing a role, and this could further their ties together. \n\nAs for how BB and VP were able to come to a deal, perhaps Kuzan was able to mediate that. Kuzan was a former Admiral, and possibly met with VP before. There's also the Saul and Ohara connection between the two. Vegapunk also once tried to replicate Logia DF powers, perhaps Kuzan offered himself before in the past to help Vegapunk's research. Weren't Kizaru's lasers implemented into pacificistas and the seraphims? Clearly, Vegapunk has worked with the Admirals before.\n\nMain hole in this theory, is that BB himself was caught off-guard by the existence of the seraphims when he was ambushing Amazon Lily. If he had struck a deal with Vegapunk at any point, there is a decent chance he saw or was shown a seraphim. But at the same time, maybe not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjw1hhhwlfna1.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ac58320bff986b6c0eb1c66b8bd7c9fa9cde7129\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5ebe1iwlfna1.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bc49b2ab51e96f14d97769da77e91e54dbda56f9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqxn71iwlfna1.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c34191f9a4d9bc9f019d99db3d07a28382b7c9fc\n\n[What did Aokiji\\/Kuzan say or promise to BB?

        "text": "Not sure how much I can say in the title, so I hope that works.\n\nRegarding recent theories about which vegapunk is the traitor:\n\n[It can't be any of the 6 Vegapunks we know](https://i.imgur.com/0rPDzf5.jpg) because if any of them were traitors, that info would be linked to Punk Records, and they would be found out.\n\nGoing by this, I think this narrows the possibilities to one of the following:\n\n* A prototype, or failed vegapunk \"00\" or \"07\" not linked to Punk Records. Perhaps he thought the prototype was dead after discarding it, and now it wants vengeance for being discarded; or to takeover Punk Records for itself and becoming the \"new\" Vegapunk. It might look like Shaka (vegapunk 01) and was a prototype of Shaka, since the latest chapter *possibly(?)* hinted that the government solders mistook Shaka for the traitor?\n\nOr \n\n* The traitor fooled the Seraphim, using something akin to Atlas' technology, where she's able to change/replace her face to be anything she want. Hence they changed themselves to look (and possibly sound like) a \"vegapunk\"\n\nOr\n\n* really doubtful based on how I perceive the timeline, but possibly Saturn (of the 5 Elders) is already on the island and ordering the Seraphim. Only way I perceive this is if Kizaru transported Saturn with his light-light fruit, but again I see this as doubtful since they clearly chose to travel by ship. So they had to off-panel decide to travel this way (for some reason). Had the ship itself arrived, I would think it would be visible on the cameras prior to the traitor taking them out. The image of the \"shadow\" on the cameras is also opposite to what Kizaru's would be like\n\nAnd before you suggest it, Mr. Mud-mud fruit guy is not smart enough to plan this out, and realistically would be in hiding if anything based on how he acted in the first chapter",

        "text": "I doubt its going to go down like this, but what if Vegapunk had a plan to lure a Gorosei member out into the open for the revolutionaries to capture. If Vegapunk is on the revolutionaries side why would he make the Gorosei the highest authority to command the Seraphim and not have a backup plan to overide that power of authority? Well I think the reason for that would be if the WG wants the Seraphim back and Vegapunk is no longer on their side and he plans on keeping the Seraphim then the WG would have no choice but to send a Gorosei member out to retrieve them since den den mushis don't work. \n\nI feel like this would be a super smart play on Vegapunk's part that shows his intelligence and helps out the revolutionaries in a huge way. Maybe that phone call he had with Dragon was Vegapunk telling them to come now. \n\nI also feel like its not being talked about how huge this is that a Gorosei member is actually leaving Mary Geoise, the few appearances we ever get of them is always in the same room. \n\nMaybe Vegapunk purposely leaked his poneglyph research to strengthen this plan ( i know he specifically said he has no idea how the WG learned about his research so im not entirely sure how this would work), but maybe he knew if he didn't make a reason for them to kill him then they would never send a Gorosei member out in the first place because he wouldn't be a threat. \n\nSo maybe this entire plan of his has to go down the way its going to truly fool the WG and Gorosei. What if the reason Vegapunk doesn't remember how the WG learned of his research is because he took those memories away using S-Bears devil fruit memory ability. What if he created this entire \"traitor\" scenario again to truly make the WG believe this is going to be an easy in and out extraction since they think they have a person on the inside feeding them live information play by play.",

Obviously almost all the Vega Punks are under attack but Shaka was just standing there until the end of the chapter so he could’ve stopped the fighting anytime pair that with the fact that he didn’t tell everyone about the seraphim’s weaknesses and that he randomly knew where Vega Punk was he’s probably the prime suspect for traitor.",
