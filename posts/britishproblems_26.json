Everything used to be fine and dandy, you knew in the morning when to expect the delivery down to the exact hour and it would hardly be wrong so you could easily plan your day.  Fast forward to now, getting a notification that DPD is going to deliver my parcel makes me dread everything because I can't expect them to deliver the parcel in one piece on time to the right address because what they usually do is drive near your house and press the customer wasn't at home button because they're too lazy to get out of the car. I usually just have it forwarded to a parcel shop. The acronym probably stands for Damaged Parcel Delivery or something. I refuse to do business with companies that only offer DPD now, I'd rather pay more to have a safely delivered parcel than to spend months on an insurance claim",

I have 2 banks to deal with and they keep on deciding \"actually, it's mastercard now\" or \"we're moving to a new type of card with different features\" and then sending me new bloody cards which means updating everything everywhere and having to remember a new code. I don't use the thing anyway, it's just numbers in systems but every time they do this I have to update all the systems. \nI know that this is a stupid first world problem and there are probably clever ways of dealing with it but it annoys me anyway.",
