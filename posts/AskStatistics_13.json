        "text": "Hello all, \n\nI've a question regarding model fitting of some laboratory data.\n\nThe data in question measures how well some laboratory procedure can quantify some target analyte in a sample. My independent variable is thus \"analyte added\" and the dependent variable \"analyte recovered\".\n\nDuring the laboratory work, we prepared two samples «with added» analyte per day and measured our «recovery». In addition, we had four different levels of «analyte added».  We did this across four days. This means that the sample results have \"pair-wise\" behaviour. That is, for every day, the two measurement recorded on that day are very similar. However, when you compare all four pairs at some level, the differences between the pairs can differ quite a lot. I added a sketch at the bottom to illustrate the data shape. \n\nDue to conventions in my field, it is customary to report the \"linearity\" of the data. Linearity here meaning that you can fit a straight line through the \"analyte added and recovered\" data. \n\nAfter collecting all the data, I started to work on model fitting, trying to fit a straight line. Firstly, I noted that the data is considerably heteroscedastic, so I needed to apply WLS. After fitting the model, I then applied the Durbin-Watson test to the residuals and found that the data also possesses autocorrelation at lag 1. \n\nCorrelation does make intuitive sense, as if the measurement from one particular day is above the regression line, the other measurement on that day is also likely to be.\n\nNonetheless, I am quite uncertain on how to proceed from here. I have tried several weights for my model. I’ve done 1/X , 1/X\\^2 and 1/s\\^2 . The latter of which I’ve estimated from both the sample data and iterative reweighted least squares techniques. Nonetheless, they all provide approximately the same regression coefficients to a model on the form y = b0 + b1x. Also, data transformation is not an option here.\n\nIn my case, I cannot be satisfied with only unbiased regression coefficients because I also need to use their standard errors in future error propagations. Therefore, my question becomes: how can I fit a straight line to this data such that I get both unbiased regression coefficients and standard errors? Should I add some additional term to account for the correlation? Should I perhaps use a linear mixed-effects model? Any help is very much appreciated!",

When I’m evaluating “time to close a ticket” for H2, how should I account for tickets that are still open, as excluding them presents a huge bias since still-outstanding tickets are the most likely to go against my hypothesis that the goal has been effective in reducing time to close them. \n\nI’ve considered something along the lines of replacing outstanding tickets with a “time to close” that is the nearest standard deviation above what it currently sits at, based on the H1 dataset. However, I was wondering if there’s some standardized statistical practice to account for this in time series analysis? Thanks!",

I want to be a “data scientist” (quotes because the role can be different titles based on the company). For the longest time I’ve been interested in the computational and statistical aspects of data science, as well as computational social science and behavioral data science. I am also heavily interested in the intersection of social and computational science, but can’t seem to find a direct degree path for such a career. Through my engineering program, i’ve had experience with R, Python, SAS, MATLABs, and some brief machine learning projects. We’ve also covered research design and experimentation. \n\nI was thinking about what program I’d like to go for, and for the longest time I was thinking applied statistics. However, I noticed that I myself spend a lot of my time learning the software side of data science that I don’t completely  from my classes and wanted to expand on my interest in machine learning applications to social sciences.  I enjoy math (specifically statistics), but I just see a pattern in myself right now that i put an emphasis on learning tools outside the theory, which makes me wonder whether an applied stats or data science degree would be the better option (or if there is some alternative?)\n\nI’ve heard some applied stats programs do have a software aspect and it’s not all theory, but many seem to be lacking in heavier computer/data science concepts. I am also mainly looking for online programs so I can gain working experience though my graduate studies and there seems to be a plethora of options related to data science but they have less “historical backing” than those related to applied statistics. \n\nWhat do you all think? Would a computational social science degree even be worth looking into? For those of you have have done either an applied stats/stats masters or a data science masters, what can you speak on the programs? I know it comes down to what I’m interested in, but where do some of these programs fall short/benefits? What may be differences in career outlooks? \n\nThank You!",

The credit-worthiness of the pool of people is calculated (in an aggregate) by taking each person's median FICO, then finding the average of those medians, and then proceeding on with the calculation with that number.\n\nWhat I want to know is, is there a statistical difference between using the mean of all the people's median scores (the way it is done now) or, just using the mean FICO score from just one of the provided credit bureau, and skipping the median part.\n\nA step further would be to take whether or not a person falls delinquent on their mortgage in their future, and then performing logistic regression to determine if the median scores, or the scores from just one of the credit bureaus do a better job of calculating credit-worthiness, or if there's no difference at all.\n\nThanks in advance, and again, I apologize if this is a rule-breaking post.",

Public reception will be measured by the Altmetrics score (comprised of news mentions, Twitter posts, etc.), internal reception by the paper's citation count.\nAmong other things, I would like to compare the internal/external ratios of various scientific publications. At first, I thought of just calculating the ratio for each individual paper and doing statistic tests between journals from there. The problem I see here, however, is that papers with low counts in either of the two measures will unduly influence the overall outcome. An example: Paper A has 4 citations and an Altmetric score of 1, giving a ratio of 4. Paper B has 1000 citations and an Altmetric score of 750, giving a ratio 1.5.\nJournals with many papers with low counts in either citations or Altmetric score will therefore trend toward extreme ratios, which is not what I want to show in my analysis. So my question would be: What's a statistically sound way of differently weighing lower and higher scores so as not to have low scores (and high ratios) unduly influence overall outcomes?\nThe sample size will be in the tens of thousands, by the way.

The defender of the chance hypothesis could point to how given that thousands of lotteries are played each year, one person winning twice is not that surprising. The defender essentially compares this event to other similar events (in this case lotteries) to rationalize it having occurred by chance. But how similar can the other events be?\n\nSuppose there is a person Joe who tells you to think of a number between 1 and 1,000,000. He then says he'll try to guess correctly. Suppose he fails 1,000,000 straight times. Another person by the name of Jane comes in and says she can do the same thing. On her fifth try, she guesses correctly. Suppose you are now tasked to figure out whether that happened by chance.\n\nIf you are an attacker of the chance hypothesis, you might say that the probability of Jane guessing it right within five tries is very low. Therefore, it probably didn't happen by chance. The defender of the chance hypothesis might say \"Well, both Joe's and Jane's events were guesses. The probability of atleast one guess being correct out of 1,000,005 guesses isn't that low.\" In this case, even though the events seem more dissimilar compared to the rigged lotteries case, the defender incorporates those trials.\n\nThis begs the question: when can we incorporate other trials? How similar can other trials be? And is similarity an objective property? Can it be said to be objectively true that the event of the New Jersey lottery occurring on Oct 8th and the New Jersey Lottery occurring on November 10th are more similar to each other than the events of Joe and Jane guessing a number? Why or why not?\n\nWhat about the naturalness of certain categories? For example, suppose Adam thinks of Jane and Jane calls her. You might put this event into the category \"thinking of someone and calling you\" since it seems natural to do so. Then, you can simply recognize that tons of people have thought of someone and they didn't call. So this particular event may not be surprising.\n\nBut what if say you invent some new game where you write down a word of five letters and ask another person in front of you to write it down as well. And they match. The probability of this happening by chance is of course very low. The defender of the chance hypothesis can again try the strategy of putting this into a category of events to increase the probability. But which category does this belong to if this game has not been played before? If it hasn't been played before, does this make this event more impressive than the event of you thinking of someone and having them call you?",

Currently I am planning to read about discrete math(combinatorics) and real analysis followed by measure theory. Basically my question is if this is enough or are there any other prerequisites for higher level statistics? Also do you have any recommendations for books about measure theory since it seems important in probability theory?",

Are there any  suggestions from your side?\n\nDetails:  My data is given by y\\_i|m,S\\~ N(g(m), S), where the physical model g is a  function which maps from R to the power of 4 to R to the power of 21,  m=(m\\_1,...,m\\_4)' is a four-dimensional vector, S is a matrix of  dimension 21x21 and i=1,...,24. \n\nI  have already used the nls.lm function from the R package minpack.lm to  estimate the parameters and this worked fine. However, my boss has prior  knowledge for the parameters m\\_j, so I would like to use this to derive  the corresponding posteriori probabilities. Unfortunately I haven't  found a suitable solution for this problem yet.\n\nHere are a few approaches which did not work so far:\n\n* rjags: Can't handle custom R-functions as far as I know.\n* rstan:  Similar problem as in rjags. Theoretically I could reprogram the  function g as a stan file but so far I didn't bother with that.\n* Acceptance  rejection algorithm: The kernel of the density is given by exp(-A)  where A is very large so the kernel is numerically zero. I could replace  this kernel by exp(-A +c) where c is a real number, but depending on  which hyperparameters are chosen the problem is present again.\n* Metropolis-Hastings  algorithm: Not sure if this algorithm is the right one for this  problem. The R packages I used so far did not really help me.\n\nHope someone here can help me and please let me know if something is unclear in the description.\n\nThanks in advance",

If I have recorded 6 injuries over 30 hours of sewing machine operation with multiple operators in multiple factories then I can estimate the mean rate of future injuries is 0.2 injures per hour of operation for similar operators and machines and factory conditions. However the actual rate of failure is random and continuously changing due to physical conditions and state of operator, machines, etc. and If workers log 100 hours of operation I can expect 20 reportable injuries (y =0.2x with no injuries at zero operation). Perhaps the historical rate is 0.1 during daytime and 0.3 at night or varies similarly by location. How would I do this type of prediction with a better fitting non-linear function? Say I wanted to develop a prediction model for each factory with additional variables to better predict injuries in the future given an estimate of future opening time (for example if I expect 500 hours of use at a new factory over next 5 year period, how many injuries should I expect based on the mean and variance of injury probability estimated using a sample of records from similar factories?). Should I be using binomial or poison function or something else, and how?\nTyvm!",
