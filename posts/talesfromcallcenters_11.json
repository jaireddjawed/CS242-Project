Primarily I dealt in payments for bills, meter readings and the like, but occasionally I'd deal with more complex cases (such as legal power of attorney cases or major business collections disputes). These usually involved a secondary department. \n\n  The players in this scenario: \n\n**The businessman (BM)**: he was an older man based in a fairly large nearby town. He seemed to have an attitude that clicking his fingers should make people immediately do everything he says. \n\n**Me**\n\n**Angela, the engineering supervisor**: she is the senior engineer for our area, based in an office in my building but a couple of floors up. In addition to her own duties, she's also the supervisor for a team of about 5 people. They take it in turns to be 'on call' for out of hours work, and it was Angela's turn this night. \n\nBM calls up, telling me he's got a problem to do with power supply to his factory premises. I do my usual security checks to check access to the account, pull it up and see the account is a business account registered under the name of a factory making metal components for industrial machines. I did the usual diagnostics with him as we usually did and it seemed to be some sort of issue to do with the supply between the main substation and his premises. It needed a call to Engineering. \n\n&gt;me: sir, I'm just going to make a call to our engineering department as it seems this will need to be referred to them. Do you mind waiting? \n\n&gt;BM: I need this sorting so I'll suppose I HAVE TO wait! \n\n*I mute his line and ring Engineering. Angela answers* \n\n&gt;me: Evening Angela, I have a query regarding what looks like an industrial premises' supply. Would you be able to conference into the call and help me? \n\n&gt;Angela: of course. Have you done full security? (*I confirm yes, I have*) Great, can you connect me? You'll have to book any work in from your end so stay on the line. \n\n*I connect her through and listen* \n\n&gt;Angela: good evening, you're through to Engineering, you're speaking to Angela. How can I help? \n\n&gt;BM: A woman? Seriously? How can *you* help *me*?! \n\n&gt;Angela: sir, I can assure yo- *she gets cut off by shouting* \n\nThis man was NOT happy about the situation one bit and began to kick off about how we wanted a 'real' engineer, not some 'daft bimbo'. This was the thing that got Angela very annoyed indeed. \n\n&gt;Angela: Look, I'm a senior engineer with a degree in engineering from [top university] as well as 20 years experience. I'm giving you the simple choice- you can either speak to me, the *most senior engineer for this area* as per my job title, or you can have no power at all. It's totally your decision. \n\nMagically this challenge turned him into a far different person to the one I'd been dealing with. He answered the questions Angela asked him, and then I was requested to raise a job for the supply engineer to deal with which Angela signed off on. Job done. \n\n\n\n",

I'm also on mobile\n\nAnyway I'd like to tell the tale of what I'd consider to be one of the most ridiculous calls I've ever take.  \n\nI take calls for one of the largest roadside assistance providers in North America. I get some pretty quirky callers from time to time but this one is extra special. \n\nFor the Sake of the story I'll be me (obv) and the lady will be crazy lady (CL)\n\nMe: 'Thank you for calling road service this is xxxx how can I help you?'\n\nCL: 'THIS GUY IS ILLEGAL\nAND NEEDS TO BE DEPORTED!!'\n\nThis is literally the first thing she says. So this lady is screaming about how this guy is illegal and needs to go back where he came from and whatever. She keeps alternating between that, 'get away from me' and 'he put *** in my coolant!' The line was bad so I couldn't make out what was poured in to her radiator. \n\nThe 'get away from me' thing disturbed me a little and customer safety is of paramount importance so I ask her if the man is threatening to harm her/is he dangerous\n\nCL: 'YES HES VERY DANGEROUS! HES ILLEGAL AND NEEDS TO BE DEPORTED!!'\n\nMe: 'Do you need me to dial the police for you'\n\nCL: 'NO HE ALREADY CALLED THE POLICE!!'\n\nWhat the fuck???\n\nSo I finally get some info out of her and she's out of my servicing area so I transfer her over to someone that can help her. \n\nI had looked at the account notes and saw that a previous agent had dealt with her. Let's call him CW for coworker. \n\nMe: 'Hey CW I just got off the phone with CL. That lady is INSANE'\n\nHe pops his head over his cubical with a big grin on his face. \n\nCW: 'Oh the radiator lady? Yeah she was wild. The guy poured Pepsi in the radiator'\n\nPepsi?\n\nPEPSI??????????\n\nI think it's pretty common knowledge to not pour foreign fluids in to your car ESPECIALLY FUCKING PEPSI. I'm bewildered at this point. \n\nCW: 'Yeah I told her not to turn her car on but she did anyway and her engine started smoking' I assumed she called in and dude was trying to fix the car while she was on the phone. \n\nCW: 'You know what she called in for right?'\n\nMe: 'No, what?' \n\nCW: 'A tire change'\n\nI lost it. The laughter was absolutely uncontrollable. So this woman popped a flat, felt that in order to fix the flat tire she needed to pop her hood and then the supposedly illegal dude FOR SOME REASON FELT COMPELLED TO POUR PEPSI IN TO THE RADIATOR! \n\nI know some of you might not be car people but I hope that all of you know that the way to fix a flat tire is not to pour Pepsi in to your radiator. I really really hope. ",

Considering the state pays for his apartment I'm sure they would loooooove to hear that hes threatening to send people to kill call center employees. \n\nAt this point I hangup which I regret since I couldn't call him out on it. Not even two minutes later the account hits my board again. Caller ID matches. Its go time. \n\nM-\"X properties, how can I help you?\"\n\nCG-\" Yeah I wanna report my lights being off in the parking lot.\"\n\nM-\"Ok I just need to get your information.\"\n\nCG-\"You dont need my information. This is so stupid. I cant wait to report you to the state tomorrow!\"\n\nAt this point I can only describe what I felt as pure joy. He walked right into this.\n\nM-\"Ok also make sure to mention to them how you threatened to send people to harm our employees. Which is a crime. I am sure they would love to hear about that. I will also be making sure the office gets a copy of that recording in the morning\"\n\nCG-\"Look....Listen....I'm sorry....You gotta understand I'm just frustrated.\"\n\nM-\" It doesn't matter sir. That is besides being illegal not even  acceptable to go around saying because you are upset. I was trying to help you and responded with threatening me and my coworkers\"\n\nCG-\"Its just that I'm worried about the women that live here....and the kids...yea there's kids that live here. I'm sorry I take medications to make me less crazy. Just please don't send them the recording I'm really sorry. I just want to report the lights being out.\"\n\nM-\"Ok, I wont send them the recording but I need your info. No more arguing about it and well forget this happened.\"\n\nI stuck to my word and didn't tell anyone else about it or send the recording out. I probably should've to teach him a lesson but putting that fear into him felt good enough honestly. After a shitty few weeks of work I figured I would share this interaction with you all. ",

        "text": "So this is a follow up to this story. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/8fpan1/coworker_has_a_problem_with_me/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link\n\nMy meeting with my management team went well. They are already aware that the other department is not very helpful and acknowledged that the agent I was speaking with had a bad attitude from the onset of the call. I didn’t receive a follow up email from the other agent regarding my apology but I didn’t really expect to anyway. Right now I am just doing my job like normal but I did make them aware that if anything happens in the future I will be reporting him and defending myself. \n\nAnyway, today was a weird day in my call center generally our customers are pleasant or if not pleasant at least not pissed off st the onset of the call but today there must have been something in the air because many customers were upset before I even picked up the phone. Honestly that isn’t a big deal, but it sets the stage for an odd encounter. \n\nIn my call center we are authorized to replace faulty equipment, if it’s within warranty we are allowed to just swap it out for them but if it isn’t we have to send them to the sales department which is pretty standard. However we have a lot of accounts that are set up under what are essentially contractors that have their own company but use us as a backend for our service. Now these contractors can have whatever rules they want or have worked out with my company as far as replacing faulty equipment for customers. We have a system we can use to view the information about the contractor and it tells us who handles replacements. \n\nI received a call today from a customer who had been trying to troubleshoot for a couple of days and she was unable to get her equipment functioning properly so she just wanted to have it replaced, which is fine, I can see from the notes on her account that she had been speaking with us working on the equipment. Additionally, the equipment she was using was not something that I troubleshoot it is outside of my jurisdiction. Hers was an account that was set up under one of the contractors so I proceed to attempt to transfer it to her contractor. \n\nTheir phone tree didn’t even have an option for in house technical support it just referred the customer back to a number that would reach me if I tried to dial it so I just flipped through the menu until I reached a rep. I briefly explained what I was calling about and the rep immediately started giving me pushback asking me what’s wrong with the terminal and whether I did any troubleshooting. I told her that I didn’t do any because it is outside of my scope and she flipped out telling me that she doesn’t replace equipment and my company does all the technical support so why didn’t I do it...\nI decided she wasn’t going to be any help so I disconnected the call and put in my own request to replace the terminal. \n\nHowever, that solution didn’t sit right with me as the account clearly states that the contractor is responsible for replacing equipment and the way that I had set it up would have made my company financially responsible and was not technically following protocol. So I consulted with my supervisor to ensure I wasn’t misreading the situation she confirmed my analysis and I cancelled the request I had put in and called the contractor back hoping that I wouldn’t get the same rep as before. \n\nYou guessed it, I got the same rep. After I introduced myself and explained what we were talking about again she became hostile telling me that if I didn’t know how to handle this she would call back and get another rep who could and obviously I don’t know what I’m doing. I explained to her that I was following the procedures based on the account info I have but she just said she would call back. So I emailed my supervisor detailing my interaction with this person and my confusion over the discrepancy between what she was saying and what the account is saying. I don’t know how the situation turned out yet as they haven’t followed up with me, but it struck me as very odd. \n\nSorry for the long post again friends! I really appreciate all the great feedback on my last post! ",

I don't miss it, but I can appreciate everything that is involved and I am ultimately grateful for the insight that I do have.\n\nOur system at $bigbeveragecorp would pull up accounts based on phone numbers.  If a customer called from a number that was listed on the account, it would populate on our screen before they connected.  This gave us the time to run our spiel welcome message while we looked over the account notes.  \n\nMy favorite call was a manager at a popular sandwich shop, with notes about how he doesn't want readbacks or verifications.  I'm 4 seconds into the call and he confirms who he is, and he wants an order, no readback.  Cool, I like simple.  I'm already pulling up the order form as he is spouting off what he wants, my fingers dancing on the num pad like a tango.  I read back the total and wish him a good day and he pauses \"wow, you're good\" \n\n37-second call? Damn straight \"I aim to please\"\n\nFast forward to this past week.  I was having a shit day.  Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong.  My new computer component was DoA and I was furious, and that was just one tiny thing on the list of crap that didn't go my way.  Boo Hoo. First world problems.\n\nWhatever.  I get a return set up with the online retailer I have been working with for the better part of a decade, get everything packaged to send it off. In my anger and haste, I forget to get a shipping label.  I find this out when I slide the box to the attendant at the delivery office. \n\nI am mad at myself, I am mad at the company, I am mad at the computer part.  I call the company and wait on hold and in that time I go run my other errands.  Hold is taking forever which is perfect for letting me cool off a bit/realize that I am an idiot, so I run into the bank.  Of course, as soon as I say hi to the teller, I get a hello from her, and a hello from a lady in my earbud.  I ask the voice inside my phone to hold on for a moment while I get my receipt.  She said sure so I hit mute.\n\nI jump back on as I am heading out of the bank, apologizing for the hold.  She said no problem and confirms my account. I give necessary info and I mention the RMA.  She tells me that she is already working to get me the shipping label I forgot to get.  Oh?  Cool, then that's all I needed.  Literally the least effort I have ever had in a phone call and it was over in less than 60 seconds.\n\nYou bet your bottom dollar she got the highest rating I could give.",

M will be Manager.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Hi there, you're speaking to Peace. How can I help. \n\n&gt; **SL**: Hi! Umm, (holding back tears) I'm in Estonia and I've lost my debit card. I'm not due back home for 3 days. I don't know what to do.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Oh nooo!! That is awful. Let me get you through some security with you and I'll do my very best to help you in this situation.\n\nVerification blah happens.\n\n&gt; **ME**: So first of all we do need to block this card for you and send you a ne-\n\n&gt; **SL**: -But I'm abroad! You don't know where I am!\n\n&gt; **ME**: I understand that ma'am but our cards take a minimum of 3 working days to be posted out to our customers. As today is a Friday night followed by the weekend they do not count as a working day. Monday is a bank holiday so that doesn't count either. You said that you won't be home for a 3 days you'll be home when the card arrives. \n\n&gt; **SL**: Oh. Oh thank so much.\n\nI finish blocking the old card and getting a new one on the way and finishing the call before releasing the customer. I had done many of these calls so didn't think anything about it. It was a bog standard 5 minute call. \n\nA month or so passes by and my manager pulls me aside and informs me that I'm needed on the first floor. I'm there surprised and confused. Nobody goes to the first floor. Unless they need to speak with HR. Or HR needs to speak to you about your CV. As far as I knew my CV was, whilst not perfect, up to scratch.\n\nSo I make my way to HR and approach one of the managers. I inform one of the managers that I had been informed that I needed to visit. \n\n&gt; **M**: Oh hey Peace! Do you remember helping **SL** a month ago? She was abroad and you blocked and sent a new card?\n\n&gt; **ME**: Oh yeah. What happened?\n\n&gt; **M**: Well she just sent you a thank you card. Well done!\n\nI was kinda happy. Not going to lie. It feels nice to be appreciated from time to time So stick in there guys. You'll get some really nice people on the phones sometimes. ",

Also on mobile, so sorry for formatting. \n\nWARNING: HEAVY SHIT\n\nSo I used to work in a call center doing outbound cold sales for charity selling raffle tickets. As you can imagine it wasn't very glamorous and neither were the upper management, but this isn't about the staff this time. \n\nThis is about one of the calls I did in the first few months working there (I was at that place for about 3+ years). \n\nNow I don't remember how the call went exactly, but I remember it for the most part. I'll be me: ME and she will be Elderly Woman: EW\n\nEW: Hello?\n\nME: Hi it's Killernitrox from Company for the Charity. How are you today?\n\nEW: Not Good.\n\nME: Sorry to hear, what's wrong? (This is where I messed up)\n\nEW: My 7 year old Granddaughter hung herself yesterday.\n\nNow the appropriate reaction to this is whatever I didn't say after hearing that.\n\nME: Shit! (Cue awkward silence for ten seconds where I'm uming and ahing) Oh, um, I'm so sorry. \n\nEW: No, it's ok. But I'm not in the mood to talk right though. I'll have to let you go sorry.\n\nME: No no, of course, no problem at all. My condolences.\n\nAnd left the call at that. This was slightly paraphrased for the part after the bomb drop, but it was super discomforting and you could tell from her voice that this was genuine. The amount of distress in her tone was unsettling and didn't feel like something you could fake.\n\nOut of curtisy I delayed us contacting her for 12 months to let her grieve (the usual cooling off period being 3-4 months), this resulted in confirming that her story was legitimate. \n\nAfter that 12 months and this being a water cooler story, I was talking with some of the newer trainees giving them advice and chatting. During the flow of the conversation, one of the girls mentioned that she had a similar call an eldarly lady whose granddaughter had passed away juuust over a year ago. \n\nBut all that being said, I didn't ask people why they were feeling down anymore.\n\n",

        "text": "I work as an agent for one of the call centers of a large Dutch electronics retailer. Customers call us with questions about products and orders in any of the stores or our web shop.\n\nI’ll never forget a particular call I had with an elderly lady, about half a year ago. She called into one of the store’s numbers, and asked for a certain installer who had visited her to set up a new tv after the old one had broken.\n\nI asked her why she wanted to speak to him. There was a little tremble in her voice as she explained to me that she had a VHS recorder, but couldn’t get the tv to display its output.\n‘Oh, easy fix’, I thought. After pulling up the receipt for the tv, I Googled the manual for the model and walked her through switching inputs with the remote. While the VHS was on and playing, she still couldn’t get it to work. While the customer was trying, she was noticeably trying to hold back tears.\n\nI latched on to that, because I thought it was a little strange that someone would cry over an old video tape recorder. I asked what the matter was.\nThen, after a long pause and a sigh, the customer opened up.\nHer husband, the love of her life, had recently passed away. She felt very sad and lonely, and tried to pass time by watching “The Bold &amp; The Beautiful” reruns that she’s faithfully taped daily for years. Then, shortly after her husband, the tv died as well. The universe is a b*tch sometimes.\n\nThe local store had sent an installer to set her up with a new tv, but this model only had HDMI inputs, no analog interfaces. This meant he had never connected the VHS recorder, something the customer noticed after he had just left and she thought she’d finally see her favorite daily 20 minutes of not-thinking-about-her-husband’s-death-tv again.\nThat’s when she tearfully dialed the store, hoping we could help her out.\n\nI stayed on the phone with this customer for over half an hour, talking about all kinds of other things to make her mind drift off to a somewhat less ‘I want to kill myself because nothing matters any more’ kind of state. During that time, I made a detailed report about the phone call and sent it out to the store manager.\nI made sure she was okay at the end of the conversation, asked her to drink a nice, big glass of water to relax a little and enjoy the rest of a beautiful sunny afternoon outside.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, and I open the incident report associated with this phone call in our incident tracking system. It turns out the store’s service department saw my message coming in, and immediately jumped on it.\nThey had sent out a technician with an analog-to-HDMI converter and a big bouquet of flowers, and they were able to make it all work on the same day this lady called. The store’s service manager wrote in the report that they were moved by my description of the call, and really wanted this lady to feel a bit upbeat again after what appeared to be a very dark time of her life.\n\nThis. This is why I still work in the same call center to this very day, almost a full year after starting out in this department. I don’t care about people who are angry, obnoxious or ‘entitled’. I don’t care about the people threatening to stalk me on Facebook, at our office or at my house address.\nAll I know is that people go through a lot of sh*t in their lives, and sometimes the trouble that’s caused (willfully or by accident) through your company can be the ultimate thing that can push somebody over the edge. Sometimes almost literally, as this example illustrates.\n\nI cared that day, and it might’ve saved this lady years. Caring saves lives.\n(And Bold &amp; The Beautiful on VHS, that too.)",

Why can’t you just answer me?! You’re worthless!\n\nEventually, he got tired and said he was done. So I said “Have a wonderful day!” \n\nOf course, he responded with “You’re making it really difficult to do that!”\n\nGood. You deserve a bad day, you jerk. ",

That being said, we got plenty of obnoxious ones too. \n\nOne day, a woman calls in asking about maternity hiking pants. Now, we don’t sell maternity clothes, nor have we ever claimed to. We do have some styles that would work for a pregnant woman but we have never ever advertised as such. So, I start by letting her know that we don’t carry what she wants, but she keeps pressing. I’ll be me, she’ll be PL for pregnant lady. \n\nMe: while we don’t carry maternity hiking pants per se, we do have a style with a very flexible waist. How about these? (Style name) \n\nPL: (looks at pants online) nnnnooo I don’t like the look of those. \n\nMe: oh ok, sorry to hear that. Honestly I’m not sure what else we have that would work for you....\n\nPL: well, what other companies should I look at then? \n\nMe: ..........I haven’t had kids yet, so I really can’t recommend anything personally. We really don’t specialize in maternity. \n\nPL: there must be someone in your department who has had kids! Let me talk to them. \n\nDid she really just demand that transfer her to someone else who works for my company, so they can tell her where else to shop? \n\nMe: actually no one on this shift has had children either. (This was true, btw. Small company small staff) \n\nPL: so you’re supposed to be this athletic company and you can’t tell me where to get good maternity hiking pants? Seriously? \n\nMe: again, we don’t carry maternity and don’t advertise as experts in such. \n\nPL: well then can you look it up for me? \n\nMe: .........(being new and not yet totally broken in) ok, well there’s.....(I quickly google some sites and read them to her) \n\nPL: no......no......no......\n\nMe: I’m sorry but I really don’t think I can be of much use here. \n\nPL: ok, well, it’s just shocking that you claim to be these great athletic experts and you can’t even recommend a good maternity pant! (And hangs up). \n\nMe:...............\n\nTL;DR: woman calls my company asking for maternity hiking pants even though we don’t sell any maternity clothes; gets upset that I don’t have a list of OTHER COMPANIES to recommend, generally tells me I’m bad at my job because I don’t know about something I don’t sell.

        "text": "New account name since I quit my old job and started a new one with a much stricter social media policy. I apologize for the length but this needs some backstory.\n\nFor over ten years, I worked at a call center providing customer care and tech support for a real estate multiple listing service. Essentially, my customers were 300-year old realtors who started in the business when property books were the big thing, and most of them were more comfortable with etching stone tablets than using a computer.\n\nThere ARE younger realtors, but the ones who knew how to use a computer rarely called unless they were complaining about another realtor. \n\nAt least once a month, a crotchety old man would call in and ask to speak with a man. My favorite calls were when I was working by myself in the evenings and weekends and didn't have anyone else to transfer him to! Oh noes, he had to speak with a female!\n\nThis story took place right after our site became browser neutral. Most of the customer care reps did not have any technical expertise other than general troubleshooting, and used IE, so I was the go-to person for any issues with Firefox and Chrome. At this time, there was an issue with Firefox where if the wrong encoding was selected, the search would turn up with every result in our system instead of narrowing based on criteria.\n\n&gt;$ME: Thank you for calling &lt;MLS&gt;, this is notyourcinderella. May I have your name and agent ID, please?\n&gt;\n&gt;$Crochety Old Man (CrOM): I need to speak with a man.\n&gt;\n&gt;$ME: I can assure you that I can help you, sir. May I have your name and agent ID, please?\n&gt;\n&gt;$CrOM: This is a technical issue. I need to speak with a man.\n&gt;\n&gt;$ME: (internal sigh) I am tech support, sir. How can I assist you today?\n\nHe continues to insist on needing to speak with a man, so I call over to a male coworker (let's call him Chip) who sits across the aisle, give him the rundown, and transfer CrOM.\n\n&gt;$Chip: Blah blah, name and agent ID please? (Pause) From what you're describing, this seems to be an issue with your browser, sir. Unfortunately, I'm not trained in how to troubleshoot this issue. We do have a specialist who can assist you... Would you like me to transfer you back to her? (Pause) Yes, I said her. (Pause) Yes, I said back. (Pause) Just one moment.\n\nAnd so Crotchety Old Man was transferred back to me and I walked him through switching his encoding. It was a quick fix, less than 30 seconds. I'd like to say that he was nicer in the future and respected the fact that even people with boobs can provide tech support, but no...\n\nHe switched to Internet Exploder so he could ask for a man. \n\nWhen I quit last fall, he was still calling in monthly, was still using IE, and didn't understand why our site no longer worked on his Windows Vista machine.\n\n\n",

        "text": "So I had a call today about a payment notice that looked a little funny. Basically it has an amount showing what they've billed and what we've paid. Theoretically, these should pretty much always match. I've been at this job for almost a year, and I'd like to think I'm pretty good at it... but this call totally threw me for a loop. His totals didn't match and nothing I thought it was ended up being right. We are short-staffed so there was no one else to ask, plus I wanted to figure it out! He was pretty cool the whole time, just wanted to know where his money was.\n\n\n\nTen minutes and several spreadsheets later I FINALLY figured out that it was calculating what his payment would have been if all the payments were at his normal pay rate but somewhere in the middle the rate dropped for one person and it threw everything off. I ended up having to get him to contracts, but it felt pretty good finding it myself and learning some new tricks in my system. Imagine my surprise when the next caller said the same thing! I was all over it pulling up everything I did last time and looking up his pay rates. \n\n\n\nTurns out everything was fine for the second caller, he just thought we were withdrawing when we were actually paying. *facepalm*\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, sorry the story was boring, just wondering if anyone else likes calls that challenge you and help you learn some new stuff!",

Same customer called in at least 3 times in an hour complaining that we owe him a new phone because the screen broke when he put a screwdriver through it. I volunteered to handle the customer when he calls back, but to give me a proper introduction.\n\nMy buddy: \"Sir, our VP of call center operations is visiting tonight and I hear his helicopter now. Would you like to address this with him?\" The hook was set.\n\nAfter a reasonable hold, appropriate to exiting a chopper and entering the building, I took the call. \"Sir, I'm the vice president of call center operations and my tech tells me you have a broken phone that we won't replace it because of the type of damage. Is that right?\" Yessir. \"And it's only because of the screwdriver through the screen?\" Yessir. \"Dammit! Sir, I assure you it is not our intent to deny servicing our loyal customers such as yourself. I have a meeting in the morning and with your permission I'd like to use this as an example.\" Yessir, yes, of course. \"I know for certain nothing will change with regard to your phone, but with this example, your example, I can assure you that this policy will undergo extensive review.\" Thank you sir.\n\nI never gave my name, never gave him an opportunity to really say much, I just bulldozed along. But he knew he finally got someone important, who was pissed off at the same policy that he was, and that guy was darned sure going to address it with other important people with him as the center of attention. Despite setting the expectation of no resolution beyond me bitching at people, he was completely satisfied.

        "text": "(english is my second language - just a warning) \n\nSo... I worked at a call centre in the Middle East for a leading logistics company. We would normally receive a lot of customers buying from an expensive clothing boutique in the UK (delivered through us). And sometimes these customers would return these items back to UK if they find it unsatisfactory etc. One fine day of 55 degrees centigrade, i received a call from a young lady wanting to return her very expensive shoes.\n\nMe: me, customer: RC.\n\nMe: Good afternoon ASD, I'm Me, how may I help you today?\n\nRC: Hi, i want to return my item to UK. But i dont know how to do that.\n\nMe: Ok, i can help u with that. Do u still have all the papers delivered to you with the shoes?\n\nRc: No. I threw it away... \n\nMe: OK. It's fine, Miss. U will need to go to the company 's website and fill in the return page.\n\nRc: i dont know how to do that.\n\nSo... Outside of my job scope, i helped her navigate the website...which had nothing to do with my company. Because i was feeling nice.\n\nThe next day she called again, and asked for me specifically. Great. And said she received an email from UK and they sent a few attachments. But she didnt know what they are for. *facepalms*. So i asked her to email me the attachments. I called her back (again because im nice)  and explained to her that she has to print these attachments and give them to the courier when he comes to pick up the item....\n\nA few hours later, i had the courier angrily shouting at me on thr phone because the lady didnt print the papers.\n\nMe, : Hi Miss RC, the courier told me that you didnt print...\n\nRC : Yeahh... I dont have a printer.\n......\n\nMe: (fuck me) ......umm...i.... Hmmm... Do u have neighbours who can help with print these papers?\n\nRc: no... I don't have neighbours.\n\nMe: *i think i actually did a head-desk.....* maybe u can ask your driver to print these at a shop somewhere?\n\nRC: no i will not....and my driver is outside, not at home. I want this to be collected now.\n\nHere is where myself, the courier, and the customer arguing with each other because the courier did have to go somewhere and he cannot make a manual waybill. In the end, we would arrange another pick up the next day.\n\nAnd again it was cancelled becasue she still didnt print those damn papers. It was a bloodbath because in these 4 days, she probably called me 5 times a day... Asking specifically for me.\n\nIn thr end, she did have the papers printed. When she called me for pickup, she told me, she and her brother bought a damn printer (finally) and made all out lives easier. \n\nSurprisingly i was not angry. Rather more amused and was pretty happy that i could help her. She was happy as well because i was oh so very patient and really did try to help her the best i could. Raving review from her to my supervisor! \n\nTL:DR. holy shit, it's too long.\n\n Who knew a freaking printer could cause lotsa problem.. When rich people dont know how to do stuff.",

        "text": "So at my call center we do have supervisors. They work from 8:00AM to 10:30PM. I work the overnight shift which is specifically not those hours. \n\n\nI get a call from this old lady, my office answers the phones for a endless number of businesses. We vet as much as we can but occasionally a slick one will get past us before we catch on. We've been dealing with this particular business for at least a couple of months and that means they're good. \n\n\nOr at least running a successful scam but that's not my job to decode. I just answer the phone, read the script take a message, but with great customer service. \n\n\nAnyways I get a call a hour past midnight for this one company that says they are a health insurance brokerage that sells insurance, so, probably you feed them your information, they set you up with a plan, and then they probably step back from then on, I don't know personally, I just pick up for the after hours line. \n\n\nSo this lady calls in, she's mad because we've charged her 80 dollars twice, then 40 dollars twice and then its 40 dollars twice the first time, and then 80 dollars the second time. between the 2 10 minute calls I had with this lady because she called twice, I put together that she was charged 39.99, twice for a total of 79.98 and she is mad as hell about this. \n\n\nI calmly explain to her, through interruptions in her tirade, a number of things:\n\n\n1. This is the after hours line, for security purposes, I don't have access to your information.\n\n\n2. I am not a licensed insurance agent, and I cannot tell you what kinds of plans we have available, because I don't have access to that information, but I assure you that it falls under the umbrella of \"Health Insurance\" \n\n\n3. Even though I personally cannot find out why you got charged those amounts, I would be happy to pass this over to our customer service desk, and they would gladly return your call during business hours to answer those questions for you. \n\n\nWell that's not good enough she needs. to talk. to my supervisor. NOW! \n\n\"Yes, ma'am I unders-\"\n\n\nI need. to talk to. your supervisor. NOW!\n\n\n\"Yes ma'am I unders-\"\n\n\nwe repeat this loop I shit you not 10 times before the lady gets frustrated and hangs up. \n\n\nIf she let me finish, I was going to tell her that I understood, but I regret to inform her that we don't staff supervisors at this hour. \n\n\nShe wouldn't have believed me anyway, she didn't even think it was me taking her call the second time she called in, where she proceeded to complain about me, to me, without realizing that guy, was also me. \n\n\nDuring the overnight hours we get a lot of crazy people who call in. And I feel confident that the business itself was not a scam, they had a office address and business hours, the whole 9 yards. This lady was just looking for a fight and was likely high on pain killers, \n\nBecause despite being a licensed insurance agent for local state she obviously had no idea what was going on, and, I feel that a licensed insurance agent with local state would have had better sense to call in to a office at 1 in the morning and complain about a charge that appeared on her card literally over a month ago.

        "text": "This happened today and it was brilliant. I was on the phone for like an hour. \n\nSo I work at a call centre for a bank, and I got a call through on the Lost and Stolen line. It was an American woman living in London whose credit card had been lost mid-March, and she still hadn’t received it beginning of May. She was telling me she’d reported this five times and still hadn’t got her card. \n\nI’m actually not trained in complaints so basically I’m listening to her chew my ear off - literally screaming at me - while I trawl through all the memos on her account to try and work out what’s happened. Eventually I work out that she called on Friday and made a complaint about all the previous calls she’d made and the fact that she still didn’t have a card. She was promised the card would be with her on Tuesday, but whoever made that complaint had actually only sent the card out today, and she will get it in 2 days. \n\nObviously, she has every right to be annoyed! This is a massive cock-up on behalf of the bank, to the level of which I’ve never seen before. She’s been on the phone like six times trying to sort this out. It seems like whoever first reported the card put a fraud block on it instead of putting a lost marker on which would have replaced it, which then prevented subsequent agents from being able to order her a new one. The last person (who was a supervisor), the one she spoke to on Friday, had forced a card out for her but for some reason hadn’t done it on the day he’d promised, and had only done it today. \n\nI tell her this and obviously she’s fuming. She asks to speak to my manager. My manager’s actually gone home because my shift has ended! We’re half an hour in at this point. I put her on hold and sprint off to try and find a manager, any manager. I find someone, briefly run down what’s happened, and she takes over the call. I have to listen in (and I can’t go home 🙃) because it’s still technically my call. \n\nThe only thing this manager, who I’ll call “Daisy”, can do is apologise and compensate her for the trouble. She cannot get the card there any faster. This is when the tirade begins, which goes on for another half hour, featuring such choice gems as:\n\n“Do you know who I am?!” (No)\n\n“Do you know how much I make?!” (No and I don’t care)\n\n“I know the royal family!” (Sure pal)\n\n“This is so fucking retarded!” (Good lord)\n\nAnd of course, the titular quote. Literally my favourite thing that’s ever been said in the history of words. I love the imagery of it. I like to think the gold plated card is atop a velvet cushion which Wills presents to her on bended knee and grovels obsequiously at her feet. \n\nDaisy was trying to get her to calm down so she could offer compensation, but getting rebuffed at every opportunity - every time she says anything she gets cut off. Eventually she says, “I am trying to help you, but you do have to let me speak.”\n\nThis sets off the worst of the woman. “What’s your name?” she says. \n\n“That’s Daisy,” says Daisy. “Would you like my staff numb-”\n\n“‘Daisy’,” interrupts the woman, imitating her voice. Daisy, by the way, is a lovely woman, with a strong Northern accent. “‘Daisy the manager’. I don’t believe you. I want to speak to your boss.”\n\nThere are no higher authorities in the call centre at the moment. There’s regular agents like me, and then there’s team managers like Daisy. All the higher-ups have gone home. Like I should have done. I was alright though, I was soaking up the drama like a sponge. \n\nEffectively, the implication this woman was giving was that because of her accent, Daisy couldn’t possibly be a manager. Which is obviously ridiculous, and kind of offensive. From this point on, Daisy is done with the woman. Obviously, she’s not going to be rude, but she’s done letting her rant. The call ends like this: \n\n“I’m sorry this has happened to you and I’m aware that it’s incredibly frustrating, but your card will be delivered to you by courier in 2 days. I guarantee that, and I am willing to give you a call back in order to confirm that has happened for you. I’m also willing to offer you compensation of £100. Would that be alright for you?”\n\nShe literally screams. And then she says, “Fine! Now fuck off!” and hangs up the line. \n\n**Reflections**\n\nI have conflicting feelings about the call, obviously. Firstly, good god I wanted my shift to be over! She literally called five minutes before I’m due to leave. Fuck it though, I get an hour overtime pay, and a good story. \n\nSecond... this is the bank’s fault. I actually don’t really care when people complain to me, especially if it’s the bank’s fault, because obviously it’s their time that’s been wasted, and she’s gone 6 weeks without a card because of some fuck up on our part. It’s not her fault and I’d be pissed off too if I were in her position. \n\nBut she was also incredibly rude. I find it hard to feel sorry for her, especially with all the bullshit she was spouting about knowing the royals etc. Like genuinely who gives a fuck. The worst thing was making fun of the accent. Like, we’re not thick because we’re from the North. And my philosophy with insults is that I just don’t let it get to me because she’s some random woman I’ll never meet in my life, but again, it makes it hard to feel sorry for her. Most people I speak to are on a scale of lovely to polite, then there’s some who are just, get the job done types, some who are curt and clearly annoyed but let you do your job. This woman was waaay on the other end of the scale. Anyway, she got a nice chunk of money for her trouble, and the issue is pretty much sorted. \n\nOn my end, it was funny, it was dramatic, I got paid to sit and listen to the whole thing. I’ll take it. ",

Apologize for formatting as I'm writing this on my phone on my bus ride back home.\n\nSo I work for a very large outdoor spa in Canada on a province border. Now, for some context: the city where the spa is built are a bunch of old assholes. They block every project the owner proposes and it takes forever to get them approved. One of these was the parking lot, which we REALLY needed since we accommodate hundreds of guests per day. So the city said fine, you can build it, but it had to be public so anyone could park. Owner said fine, built 3 lots way into the forest.\n\nAnyways, the province where we operate and the one next to us have some different traffic laws and tickets. When they get expired license tickets, it's around 100 bucks, whereas here it's roughly $500. So naturally, cops stalk cars on our lot to fill up their quotas and we can't legally do anything about it. Usually we get angry calls and tell them to contest it and that's that. But this one was different. I'll be ME and Entitled Lady will be EL\n\nME: (Standard greeting)\n\nEL: (already pissed) Yeah please tell me why you guys allow the police to patrol your private property and give out tickets. I just received a $500 ticket from the day I parked at your place.\n\nME: Actually, our lot is 100% public because (explains why). Therefore we have no authority to tell the police to leave, and unfortunately they go around giving tickets if your license plates have an expired ticket on them. Due to different province laws, they apply the ticket price of our province.\n\nEL: This is ridiculous! I go there all the time and always say wonderful things about your spa to everyone I know! I'm not threatening you, but I'm in a position with my work and social media to put out a really negative opinion\n What are you going to do about it?\n\nME: I'm sorry ma'am, we can't do anything since it's the police who give out the tickets.\n\nEL: But my plates weren't even expired!! I paid my sticker, but you have to understand that I'm a woman, so I can't take out my license plate on my own, so I puy my sticker in my glove compartment.\n\nME: If you can prove that they weren't expired, I would definitely recommend contesting the ticket.\n\nEL: Well what're you going to give me for my trouble then?\n\nME: ....

        "text": "Ex-call centre worker here. Apologies for the length. I recently got let go from my last job and I believe that my manager set me up for failure. I worked in debt collection and for the most part, actually enjoyed it. I just hated being on my manager's team.\n\nShe was 40 but acted like an excited 14 year old most of the time. Her background was in sales, so she treated debt collection like it was just that. She wanted our team to try and get as much money from customers as we possibly could, regardless of their circumstances (and a lot of them WERE in dire straits). She was obnoxiously loud and would shout over to you even if you were on a call. I ended up breaking my concentration a lot of the time because she kept doing that. She was sickeningly pally with one of my team members (who was just as awful as her) and also had a crush on one of the Legal managers, something she kept loudly making a point about whenever she could.\n\nDuring my time at the debt collection agency, I suffered a bereavement that really took its toll on me (my friend committed suicide). It began to affect my performance on calls, but eventually I got better. I still got one failed call every month but I saw that as an improvement to how I was doing before. My manager started making a life a misery during this, sitting with me and listening into my calls, always telling where I could improve instead of telling me what was good. She started listening to my calls at her desk and would yell over to me 'what I should have done instead' in front of the rest of my team. This was embarrassing for me because some of my team members would ask me about it during my breaks. It was always the same: \"You did X, when you should have done X - but at least you had a positive tone.\"\n\nThere was also the passive aggressive comments too. She sat with me once during my calls and asked me what I was doing at the weekend. I told her my boyfriend and I were going out clubbing, to which she replied: \"You don't look like the sort of person who goes out.\"\n\nShe also pulled me into her office twice to tell me that I had an apparent BO problem and needed to sort it out - despite the fact that I shower and use deodorant and perfume religiously. I couldn't smell anything at all and even got a second opinion from my housemates, who told me they couldn't smell any BO coming from me either.\n\nAnother passive aggressive incident that occurred is when she had to leave the office early to take her dog to the vet's. The next day, we had a training session and were all gathered in the break room waiting to go in. She was telling the rest of the team about her dog, and one of my team mates, a girl I got on quite well with said \"We missed you!\". Manager then yelled over to me \"I bet YOU didn't miss me, did you Lola?\", making me feel really awkward.\n\nMy manager gave me an ultimatum - I had to go a month without getting anymore failed calls otherwise I'd have to go. This probably would have been doable if she hadn't kept hovering over my desk and shouting over at me 'what I should have done' in front of the rest of my team. She was beginning to put real pressure on me to the point that I was getting migraines, severe depression and hair loss. She NEVER put any of this pressure on any of my other team mates when they made a mistake. In fact, she'd talk quietly to them about it and say \"Just remember X for next time, okay?\"\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was when I got a call from a couple who believed they had a settlement set up and wanted to know why it wasn't going ahead. It turned out that the last person they spoke to had messed up and set it up as a normal direct debit. We have to take settlements to managers for approval, so I put the couple on hold and took it to my manager. She looked through the notes and said I was okay to set it up for them. Normally we have go through an income and expenditure form with customers just to make sure that we're not going to put them in any financial difficulty, so I asked my manager if I should go through that with the couple. She said there was no need and left it at that.\n\nA couple of days later, she listened to a couple of the calls I'd done and made her usual loud passive aggressive comments in front of everyone. She then sent me an email saying I needed to see her immediately as soon as I'd finished with my call. I went over to her desk, feeling horribly anxious because I knew I'd made some kind of mistake somewhere. She brought up the settlement call I made and said it was an automatic failed call because I didn't run through an income and expenditure with the couple. I was aghast. I told her that I only did EXACTLY what she told me to do on that call. She made up some lame excuses such as \"Yes, well, you still should have gone through it with them regardless, I understand it was somebody else's mistake, but you should have fixed it.\"\n\nShe told me we'd need to have an official meeting about my performance. Knowing what was going to happen, I didn't turn up and went for a McDonald's. I'd like to think I had the last laugh there.",

        "text": "I work in a smaller UK Breakdown &amp; Recovery company, unlike the largest companies, we do not have our own fleet of recovery vehicles or service vans, we rely on contracts with recovery operators all across the country, passing the job details over to them. Which is a lot cheaper.\n\nWhile we have our own small inhouse Breakdown Scheme, we mostly rely on being the breakdown service for insurance companies and the like, we are also the recovery service for a large insurance company for insurance claims (accidents, fires etc.). It's a pretty good deal since we don't have to rely nearly as much on marketing, and the companies can slap their name on the schemes, and they and customers pay less for pretty much the same quality of service.\n\nDespite the fact that most people calling in are having a shitty day, and with some finding out they are not actually covered and need to pay a load of money for us to come out, most callers are kind and polite, we hardly get any horrible customers.\n\nWith that out the way, I'll bring us over to my tale. I was only in the job for a short moment at the end, but I can go through the series of events.\n\nCustomer calls in that his van isn't starting at home, and the engine isn't turning over. (Most likely a flat battery, most the time we can just jumpstart the vehicle.)\n\nUnfortunately for him, he had only a basic breakdown cover that did not cover him at home. So he had to first chuck up a chunk of money for someone to come out to him to try to get someone someone to start (Happens often, most people decline and get someone else to jumpstart the vehicle or pay a Garage or Recovery Company directly as its usually cheaper).\n\nWe head out to the location, and we discover that the house *used* to be his home address, and that it was now his Ex Wife's home and he had been kicked out, and she had a restraining order against him. The recovery agent explained that apparently he tried to murder her (not sure if true or not). The van likely lost charge in the battery for not being used so long due to the restraining order and/or stuck in possible jail.\n\nHe had a court order that allowed him to pick his vehicle up from the property, however the Ex didn't believe it applied to the recovery agents so refused to allow them on her property. Police were called and got on scene, and while they asked her to allow them on, she still refused. During this time the recovery operator was on scene (or near it in this case) that they started charging waiting time, which the customer was not covered for and had to pay for too.\n\nMy small part was calling him telling him to pay up. He was of course incredibly angry. He refused as he believed the recovery operators had done nothing so he didn't have to pay a thing, swore and hung up.\n\nDon't know what happened after that, afterwards we would have our accounts team chasing payment, it would be easy in this case as the customer has to agree for us taking further payments if there are additional charges when they do their first payment.\n\nTLDR: Customer wants a jumpstart. Has to pay first. Ex Wife refuses to have anyone touch her property and now the customer has to pay even more for us waiting around too.",

        "text": "So I work in a call center that has tiers of technical support. I am in the second tier of support and we only handle specific customer concerns. If they have concerns that are outside of the scope of my job I have to transfer them to another tier of technical support because I literally cannot help the customer.\n\nAnyway, our call center has a policy for most transfers of calls that you only remain on hold for two minutes if the other department hasn’t answered within two minutes we are allowed to simply drop them in the queue. The next tier of technical support is notorious for having extremely long hold times, and I am probably in the wrong but I got into the habit of just dropping people in their queue because it’s a waste of my time and productivity to wait an extra two minutes when 80% of the time they will not answer within two minutes. \n\nSo because I was cold transferring every call to this other department they could sometimes see my name in the caller I.D. If they once in a blue moon answered right away, but I had already disconnected and dropped the customer. So one specific agent every time he saw my name on a cold transfer would email my supervisor essentially tattling that I wasn’t following proper procedure. Yes I will admit that I was probably in the wrong and I did have a couple of conversations with my supervisor regarding it, but really? The only difference between me transferring the call and the customer being the one on the line when they answer is that they have to verify the customer which I do for them anyway so it really doesn’t save any time for me to transfer the call anyway. This guy is just apparently too good to verify customers for some reason. \n\nDue to this guy emailing my supervisor every time I cold transferred a call to him the transfer policy for his department and only his department was changed. Now instead of only holding for two minutes we have to hold as long as it takes them to answer the phone. The longest that I have had to hold waiting for them so far is 25 minutes. This is lost time that I could be taking calls from other customers and doing my job, but apparently because this guy is too good to take a minute or two to verify customer info at the beginning of a call that doesn’t matter. \n\nOkay this has turned into a bit of a rant but bear with me. The department that I have to transfer calls too is also notorious for giving people transferring calls to them pushback after they have verified what the customer issue is. So instead of just accepting the call and answering whatever the customer concern is they will give you the answer and expect you to talk to the customer about t even though I have no idea how to service their equipment and no ability to answer follow up questions if they have them. We have sent emails and talked to their supervisors about this but their attitudes haven’t changed. \n\nThe other day I transferred a call to the next tier of technical support and, after waiting 15 minutes on hold who answers but the guy who has a problem with me. I go through the whole process of verifying the customer for him and helping him pull up their account and then he asks me what their issue is. I briefly explain what the customer said to me and he asks if he can place me on hold. I have no real recourse except to agree to be placed on hold because I am expecting maybe a minute or two while he gets a system pulled up or something, but no he places me on hold and doesn’t come back for more than five minutes. When he does come back on the line he says oh yeah I looked up the customer concern and the answer is blah blah blah. Essentially he just placed me on hold while he did his job. That is not okay. I can be taking actual calls while you are over their doing what you get paid to do. That, to me, is a form of call avoidance. \n\nWhen he gives me the answer he heavily implies that he wants me to get back on the line with the customer so that I can provide them the answer that he just gave me. No. That’s not how that works. So I call him out on it. I admit that my tone was probably not the best, but I basically told him that I didn’t appreciate being placed on hold for five minutes for no reason and next time I would appreciate it if he didn’t do that and then asked him if he could give the customer the answer he gave me. \n\nHe agreed and I transferred the caller to him but apparently he was offended by my calling him out because he didn’t email my supervisor he emailed my boss’s boss. So I had to have a meeting with my boss where we listened to the call. My boss’s boss expected me to send the guy an email apologizing to him. \nAt first I flat out refused to apologize without being able to say something like “I apologize for my town, but I don’t appreciate you wasting company time and resources by placing me on hold for no reason.” Apparently that doesn’t count as an apology. Then I calmed down and agreed to send a one sentence email just saying “I apologize for my tone.” and I informed my supervisor that I would be filing a complaint on Monday with HR because at this point I feel that this agent has it out for me specifically. I’m not going to lose my job simply because some guy in another department has the temperament of a child and can’t go through an interaction without tattling to mommy like a child. Now I have a meeting scheduled on Tuesday when my boss’s boss gets back into town, which would have happened regardless of whether I was going to file a complaint. I feel like I am owed an apology as well. \n\nI know that I am probably being petty and that this was a very long rant, but I would appreciate some input on this. ",

You're speaking with CheesyBitterbal from company xxx, What can i do for you? \n\nUL: *Yeah hi, i'm calling to let you know that i know my bill is due in about 3 days.* **customer chuckles** *i've simply forgotten to pay it. You see i'm on vacation right now and i don't have any option to pay it from where i am right now.*\n\nMe: Ehhh... Okay? So.... what would you like me to do for you then? (Mainly because i still don't quite understand why she's calling to just let us know) \n\nUL: *Well i'll be returning in about 2 weeks so i'll be able to pay the bill then. So i'm asking you to extend the deadline with 2 weeks to prevent any extra charges.*\n\nMe: Well i can't do that sadly. You going on a vacation doesn't exempt you from your financial responsibilities and this bill has been unpaid since March. You have 30 days to pay this bill before we add extra charges for not meeting the due date.\n\nUL: *Well i've been a longtime customer of your company and i've always paid on time! I don't see why this is a problem at all?! I'm just simply asking your to give me an extension in paying so i don't have to pay extra!* \n\nMe: Ma'am, as i've explained, we've already given you a full month to pay the bill and have sent you a reminder that you need to pay before xxxx date to avoid the extra charges. And again, you being on vacation does not validate as a legitimate reason of waiving those charges. It's as simple as that. I won't extend the date. \n\nUL: *Well this means i'll never use your sevices ever again then! It's as clear as the sky! You're just being rude and unreasonable so there's no reason to me ever using your services again!* \n\n- Small sidenote, This is of course the wrong kind of tone to strike with me. I'll be just as blunt as you are in the call and luckily my current company allows this kind of language.\n\nMe: Well we'd be sad to lose you as a customer. But as i've explained i can't fulfill your request due to the reasons i explained already. Anything else i can help you with? \n\nUL: **doubling down on her history with us and me being unreasonable for not extending her deadline with 2 weeks** *Fine i'll never use you again then! Goodbye!*\n\nSome people... I personally am unable to understand this kind of reasoning..... How in the hell would you being on vacation exempt your from your financial responsibilities, and why would we be forced to just extend your deadline because you've used our services before? I mean.... You've used our services before so you damn well know that you have to pay before the deadline to avoid said charges.....\n\nI'm going to need another drink this weekend to process this one! ",

So this guy calls in to our queue at 4:59.99pm ( our lines shut off at 5 MST) because he was having difficulty putting his shed together. \n\n\nI ask him what I can do to help and offer tips. He says he has tried just about everything and he can’t get the floor panels to go together (this is literally step 1). I offer to send a video to explain and he says “I’m not stupid, I know how things are supposed to go together”. Usually when people say this, we know that it’s going to be a rough call with a stubborn SoB. I offer to put him in touch with our installation department who would put him in touch with someone to pay to build it for him, but that they wouldn’t be able to get back in touch with him until the next day as they were gone already. He demands me to give him a quote of how much it will cost for people to come out and I tell him I don’t know (I had an idea of how much it would cost but we are told to never quote anyone as it leads to a lot of confusion and he said/she said. Any way, he gets mad and asks to speak to my supervisor, but they are all gone so I go find someone for this dunce to talk to. I find someone who will talk to him and I explain the situation and he just laughs. The guy is asking for 250-300$ installation on his shed that costs 350-400$ free because he is too stupid to put it together. My “supervisor” proceeds to tell him, that he should just return it if he is having trouble with it but that we can send him videos to help if he would like. The guy hangs up in a huff.\n\nWe sell unassembled sheds, so yes you do have to build it yourself.\n",

I’m not a fucking robot, I have feelings, there are humans on the other side of your phone. The worst part is, I can’t even tell them “hey, I understand your frustration, but please stop screaming at me.” All of this abuse due to something as unimportant as makeup. I’m not stupid, i graduated from a highly respected four year university and I just need money while I find a job that doesn’t make me feel like I’m going to slit my fucking wrists. I already have my own set of anxiety and depression issues, I don’t need a job that only makes my mental state a thousand times worse. I just...UGH. I don’t get paid enough to be able to handle this.\n\nSorry if this post is just a rambling mess. I feel like I just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nEDIT: Oh shit, my rambles got more attention than I realized they would.\n\nThank you kind internet strangers for all the good vibes and advice you’ve thrown my way. You helped me realize that even though the world may seem like it it filled with bad people, the kindest of people will always help out those that need it most. ❤️\n\n",

I greeted him with the usual,\n&gt;\"Hello, __ Public Library, this is ME, how can I help you?\"\n\nIt turned out that this man has a melodiously deep voice (abbr. MDV), which can be a problem for me as I tend to have a harder time hearing/understanding low frequencies.  I turned my phone's volume up and strapped my brain in - this conversation was going to take a little more effort than normal.\n\nMDV started to tell me what he wanted, but suddenly a little dog let out a loud \"yip\" in the background.  Without a moment's hesitation MDV shouts in his loudest voice,\n&gt;“Shut up I’m on the phone that's very disrespectful dog!”\n\nI'm quite positive he did not move the phone from his mouth.\n\nI was first deafened, then stunned, then I immediately started typing his words into the nearest text box.  Because honestly, who actually believes that their dog understands the concept of \"phones\" or \"respect\"?!\n\nFortunately, our tale does not end here.  MDV continued to explain, while I was still stunned and missing words, that he had checked out a movie from the library and wanted to know where to get a copy.  Specifically, he asked if someone could make a copy for him.\n\n&gt;Me: \"I'm sorry, sir, but that's actually illegal.  You could try buying the [1980s comedy title] from Walmart, or check Amazon or eBay..\"\n\n&gt;MDV: \"Well where do you buy movies from?\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"I buy my movies from Amazon.\"\n\n&gt;MDV: \"No where do you buy movies from? Like the library!\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Oh. [brain wrrrrs] We buy our DVDs from a company named ___.\"\n\n&gt;MDV: \"Could I buy it from them?\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Uh, [wrrrr] I don't think so... They mostly deal in high volume sales.  We have an account because we spend thousands of dollars a year with them.\"\n\n&gt;MDV: \"Well can you give me the phone number, or is that supposed to be a secret?\"\n\n&gt;Me: [According to a basic Google search,] \"The number is xxx-xxx-xxxx.\"\n\nGood luck, sir.",

After verifying his info, this is what went down:\n\nHim- I went to a meeting for ABC and got information about your plan\n \nMe- This is XYZ, it sounds like you had a group meeting with a different insurance. \n\nHim- Well it says the copays for a PCP are $20, ER is $100, Specialist is $25... isn’t that your plan?\n\nMe- No sir, our copays are *blah blah blah*\n\nHim- Then why do I have XYZ information at my house?\n\nMe- It looks as though we sent material to you a few months ago regarding our plan options. \n\nHim- No. I got it from the group meeting with ABC \n\n!?!?!?!?!!??!?!?\n\nMoving along, he became frustrated after I told him we have 3 different plan options. He told me to tell him about the plans, and we are directed to ask “Are there any specific questions you have?” Since it’s impossible to sit and explain absolutely everything regarding one of our plans. \n\nHim- I want to know everything. \n\nUhhhhhhh.\n\nHim- Oh, what happens when I die? \n\nMe- Well...\n\nHim- Can my wife still be on the plan?\n\nMe- Yes, she would remain on the plan for as long as she would like. \n\nHim- How would she pay?\n\nI explain that she could possibly receive his pension after passing, depending on how he has it set up, and that we also mail out coupon booklets so she can send a check. \n\nHim- what if she can’t do either of those?\n\nMe- She could set up a direct deposit, but it would have to be through her bank. She would-\n\nHim- You know, it’s like pulling teeth with you. You don’t seem to ever give me a direct answer. Are you always there, taking phone calls? Why didn’t you tell me about that option in the beginning?\n\nI get that I didn’t come out with DIRECT answers, but the way our plan is set up and the way we’re trained, we’re supposed to be this way to ensure we hit every possible scenario since these people don’t know ANYTHING about insurance. This was the first time someone ever took it the wrong way. So I start crying, but don’t let him hear. \n\nMe- I am always on the phones, sir. That payment option is very rarely used here, I apologize. It wasn’t the first option to come to mind. \n\nHim- Well you should be more forward with your answers. Goodbye.\n\nMe- I’m sor- \n\n*CLICK-*\n\nI know he’ll call back again and complain about me. \n\nHappy effing Wednesday. \n\n\n",

A technician contacted us if they needed to query an account, or to amend equipment codes or just general information about a job. We had an AHT of 30 seconds, which sounds ridiculous, however it was surprisingly achievable as the tech knew that we had such a short AHT and they usually only had a quick question such as \"is it 22A customer street or 22B customer street?\" that sort of stuff. Anyway, we get our regular techs who have a cheeky attitude and really care and appreciate the agents on the phone, so we form a special 30 second bond with them :).\n\nWell, here's one of the worst calls I have ever taken in this department...\n\nI'll be M, tech will be T and Crazy Pants will be CP. \n\nM: Hello, Tech ID and area ID.\nT: 1234 and 01\nM: Hello T, its M! What job you on?\nT: I'm at CP's house on 666 Hell St.\nM: Go'tchya, whats up?\nT: I'm refusing to work on this job due to health concerns.\nM: Sure thing T, I'll close the job down. Whats wrong?\nT: Cat and human poop everywhere. Disgusting. This will need to be visited by a manager if the customer wishes to re-book after he cleans the place up. \n\nNow this is surprisingly quite common, our techs will not work in a dumpsite for obvious reasons. \n\nM: I've closed the job T, Speak to you soon!\nAs soon as I finished speaking I heard screaming, which I could only describe as a warrior going into battle, followed by the sounds of a struggle. \nM: T, everything okay over there?\nT: The c**t has locked me in the cupboard!\nM: He what?\nT: He just punched me and dragged me into his cupboard. \n\nI just froze and asked T to repeat what he just said.\n\nT: I'm locked in!\n\nI then heard CP telling T that he has a knife and he will use it if he calls the police. \n\nM: T, I'm going to call the police and I'll let your manager know whats going on. \n\nI call my manager over and I get them to dial 999.\n\nM: T, the police are on route and your manager has been notified.\n\nT then remained silent, and I could hear brief gasps and whimperings. The poor boy must of been distraught. \n\nI stayed on the phone with T until the police arrived. My AHT went from 26 seconds to almost 5 min after that call. \n\nI was taken off the phones to calm down and I spoke to T's manager who confirmed that T was safe but a bit shaken up. \n\nSadly, I never heard from T again and I never found out what happened to Crazy Pants. \n\nI was, however, put on coaching for a week after my AHT for that week was over 30 seconds.

She was understandably VERY frustrated as no one could tell her when we were planning on getting that shit off her lawn.

I think you know this is not good news.\n\nCut a long story short, we are told the call centre will no longer be taking calls in 8 weeks time. We will continue to work for another year working through the backlog of PPI claims, after which the centre will close and we will all be out of work.\n\nI am absolutely gutted.  Worked so hard on working up the ladder all for no reason.  NOthing in the area to move to within the bank.  A few branch vacancies but no chance of getting those. \n\nSome people have worked at that centre for 20+ years.  Others a few years until retirement having pensions messed  up. People like myself are broken and devestated.  Some are happy as they been looking for an excuse to leave.  Atmosphere is terrible, struggle to do job properly.  Not sleeping well.\n\nAt least I can be comforted that \"The decision was not an easy one and we did not take it lightly.\"  the same bull I have to give customers when they find out their branch is closing.\n\nWages are great, all the added benefits we get will be missed and I doubt anyone gives as good as I get now.  At least I have I 14 months notice.  I will be staying to last day to get max amount of redundancy and qualifying for share schemes I paid into.\n\nJob for life I was told. Oh well. ",

        "text": "I haven't posted in a while so I thought it's time to tell y'all about the dumb sh!t I gotta deal with. \n\n---\nSo I work for a major bank (not that one; the other one). More specifically, I work for their fraud team. My department's job is to tell customers why their payments have been stopped and ensure them that we will push the funds through. Unless there's a credit into the account of which we require proof that they belong to the customer. In these cases it's usually because they're doing something that they shouldn't be.\n\nMore often than not, payments are stopped because it's an unusually large transaction being sent or that they're paying a company and/or person that they haven't paid before. When we spot these transactions and the customer confirms that it is fraud, the card must be blocked and a fresh one sent out, whilst we investigate what happened and how. Most customers are okay with this because they're assured that by getting a new card it will stop the fraudsters spending on their card. Most. Out of 20 calls you'll get 3/4 scenarios that don't go as planned. \n\nI will be `ME` and the customer will be `DL` for Daft Lady.\n\n---\n&gt; **ME**: Hi there. Welcome to `Bank`. You're speaking to Peace. How may I help you today?\n\n&gt; **DL**: You've stopped my card! I can't even use it online!!\n\nThat always lets me know how tough the call will be. I pray for the day customers stop shouting from the get go. Anyway, we do the usual verification 'blah' and I proceed to inform her that I will read through some payments on her card, and all she has to is either confirm them as genuine or fraud. There turns out to be three payments she does not recognise. Fraud.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Okay `DL`, as you don't recognise these payments we would need to block your card and send you out a brand new one. This would stop the fraudsters making anymore payments on your card, online.\n\n&gt; **DL**: Oh. But I need £50 from the machine. Can't you just stop those payments and leave my card unblocked?\n\nThe amount of customers that think this is possible makes me want to *facedesk*. Ya can't stop something that's already left. That's why we're going to investigate and trace the funds. We have IP addresses of every single payment.\n\n&gt; **ME**: No ma'am. Your card has been compromised and therefore we need to secure it by blocking the card and sending you a new one. \n\n&gt; **DL**: But I can't have it blocked. I need my card!\n\nNow when customers argue like this, I like to give them options. It usually lets them realise that we need to block the card. Usually. \n\n&gt; **ME**: (in the same professional tone). So you have two options. 1) I can secure your card by blocking it and sending out a new one which ensures that the fraudsters can't use your card. Or, 2) I can leave it unblocked for more fraud to happen. What would you like me to do?\n\n&gt; **DL**: Well, the sarcasm doesn't really help now, does it? So that can stop. \n\n(internally) B!xxx those are literally your only options. There's no sarcasm. \n\n&gt; **ME**: I'm sorry you feel that way ma'am but there's nothing else I can do. If you want cash you can go to the branch with some ID and you can draw out money over the counter.\n\n&gt; **DL**: Ooh there's no way I can go to the branch now at this time. I'm disabled and can't get anyone to drop me off. (She had four hours before it closed). Tell you what. Leave the card unblocked so I can get some cash from the machine and I'll then call you tomorrow so you can block the card. \n\nAnd it was at this precise moment that I muted her and literally facepalmed. I went back:\n\n&gt; **ME**: Okay **DL**, but that would mean that `Bank` will not be liable for any future fraud payments that happen on your card. So from right now until you ring us back if there are anymore transactions that you claim you didn't do, they will not be investigated. Are you sure you still want to leave the card unblocked and open to fraud.\n\n&gt; **DL**: Yeah that's  fine. I understand.\n\nI finished of the call and wrote in her account notes about everything that she has said. Just to back myself up. Then I told all my colleagues this story and they laughed. I wish I was allowed to forcibly block cards regardless of what the customer want's but alas, it is their money and if they want access to it we have to allow that. Yes, there will be more tales. ",

I work for a mobile phones company as tech support in the UK but I support 3 languages.\n\nSo far, the most stupid customers have actually been from UK.\n\nHere is one of the stories I have. It's a minor one, I do have more and better ones to share.\n\nMe: Hi there, thank you for calling [company name] customer support. My name is K. , how can I help you today?\n\nCustomer: You've given me labels but Royal Mail still wants to charge me for shipping. \n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that sir, but we do not issue labels for Royal Mail. Our default courier company is DHL. May I have your reference number so I can look into it, please?\n\nCustomer: - gives reference number-\n\nDPA happens. I check the case. \n\nMe: Okay, sir. As far as I can see, you have received labels for DHL. Royal Mail, therefore, is not required to send it free of charge as they are a different company and do not have a contract with us. If you wish to proceed with sending your phone by RM, then unfortunately, you will have to cover the shipping cost by yourself.\n\nCustomer: Well, you better issue me RM labels as I'm standing in front of the post office and I'm not wasting any more time on this damn phone. \n\nMe: I'm do apologise for any inconveniences and I'm terribly sorry for any confusion, but we do not have a contract with RM so we cannot issue you those labels. We can issue new DHL labels if these are close to expiration date. If you give me 2 minutes and the postcode you're currently at, I'll check for you where the nearest DHL depot is. \n\n\nHe wouldn't have it and kept going at how we have to give him Royal Mail labels. \n\nIn the end, he got really pissed off with me, said we have really bad customer support and hung up.\n\n\n\nLike, how? Did I miss something there? Agents who were sitting near me and overheard the call, were laughing their asses off. I'm still trying to figure out how I managed to sound serious on that call. ",

        "text": "Obligatory this didn't happen today but in last june/july. So basically I had just finished with my second to last caller, maybe my last, because usually i wouldn't get any calls after 4 p.m. So she calls in (maybe 45-55 judying by her voice) and after the usual introduction and stuff, she says her card isn't working. Just to check up, I ask her, if it's her SIM-card or SD-card (because how many can you have). She said it was her SD-card. So i check up her phone, that is connected to her number. Check the stats, and BOOM. Her phone supports up to 32gb. Ask her what size is her SD-card and she said \"64\" and I'm thinking to myself like:\n \"Omg, this can't be real\". Ensues a twenty minute call, after my shift has ended mind you, she's yelling at me about how the company, I work for, screwed her over and I should buy her either a new phone or a new SD-card (which both are rather pricey in my country, idk about you). So I basically just listened to her and told her to phone in, when she's calmed down. \n\nTL;DR: a woman calls in, said her SD-card isn't working and 20 minutes of pure rage ensuded.\n\nSorry for the formatting and miswritten words, drunk and on mobile.",
