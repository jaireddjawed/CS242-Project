        "text": "I have tried various methods of self-improvement for the past six years. They have yet to help me. I have maintained a routine of meditation, exercise, and journaling for (approximately) the past five years. I also read and maintain various hobbies (writing and composing). I keep myself busy and do not use much social media (only reddit; it does not consume my day). I do spend time learning new things (currently working on tarot). I am in college and am working on getting a job.\n\nI have also tried: gratitude journaling, affirmations, subliminals, reality shifting, therapy, medication, volunteering, participating in book groups, vitamins, dopamine detoxes, spending extended periods of time outside, being more involved in religion, dietary changes, trying new hobbies, going outside of my comfort zone. I have tried each of these for an extended period of time (anytime between a month to multiple years; discipline is not an issue). My mood does not improve. I do not enjoy being alive and I want to enjoy being alive. I want to enjoy parts of my life and feel happy. I want to stop being miserable all of the time.\n\nHow do I change this and make self-improvement work for me?",

Instead I spend majority of my time on my phone. \n\nMy average phone use is about 6-7 hours a day. When I am feeling angry/sad it’s even more time. I feel completely addicted to my phone.

However I’m on day 2 and I have been on my phone the same amount of time but instead just frequent different apps. \n\nI feel like ever since I bought a smart phone my life and mental issues have significantly worsened. I don’t believe this is who I really am. I am typically the nature girl. A hippie. I used to love doing outdoor activities. I used love grounding and yoga. Technology was never an interest of mine. \n\nThis person who has taken over has wasted so many hours everyday. I believe in using a phone in the right way for learning especially but for some reason I never have. It’s never even crossed my mind until just recently.

        "text": "I, (17F) am a very soon-to-be graduating senior in high school. Throughout the majority of my high school career, I never felt necessarily accepted due to what I believe, is because I moved and attended my high school for the first time during my freshman year, which was shortly ruined due to Covid. I was only able to return to high school during my Junior year.\nThis has led me to not know the majority of people who attended my school, and I feel that I am targeted as a result. I as well feel that it’s because I do not feel like I belong to my current generation. I hate our slang, style, and especially our attitudes, which has led me to develop much more of a proper attitude than most. People tend to treat me differently simply because I’m quiet or too awkward when given any ounce of attention. I cannot do anything without being “targeted” because of this.\nEarlier today, I was working on a poster within a group, and a girl in the group beside me said that she needed a yellow pencil, which was a pencil I just so happened to have. I gave her the pencil which in response, sparked the reaction of a popular girl in my group (18F) to speak to me as if I were a child, in a voice that you would use with a child, all but in a passive-aggressive manner.\nShe said…\n“Oh, my Godd! JGP81795, you’re so niceee— Augh! I could neverrr!” \nI do not know why she felt the need to say this, but this is only one example from many others that have occurred nearly every day these past two years from not only herself, but from others too.\nI am not a child, and if anything I am by far from one.\nAt the moment academic-wise, I’m a 4.0 GPA Cross Country Varsity Captain and have received a full-ride scholarship to my wanted college where I will peruse a dual major in secondary education and history.  I will as well be enrolling in its AROTC (Army Reserve Officers Training Corps) program so I can commission into the Army once I graduate.\nIn the real world, I’m a manager that runs a dairy farm. I milk cows, operate machinery, and renovate my boss's property for when the milk inspector comes.\nI am typically a humble person, but the reason I’m saying this so that you may have a window into my life and understand why I’m so frustrated.\nI want the respect that I know I deserve. \nSimply because I choose not the follow my generation's ways, and rather chose to be my own individual does not me I deserve any less respect than from what I should be given.\nI know that if I do not take a stand, or do anything about this, this treatment will continue. \nSo with that said…\nHow do I not become a target?",

This stopped after sometime and didn’t bother me and now it started again. I’m searching again on google about different mental illnesses and this time I’ve convinced myself I have ocd and bpd.

        "text": "I see this happening a lot and I just want to share this with people. I think that the vast majority of problems comes from the fact that people think others know who you are and what you've been through. Truth is that **they most likely don't**.\n\nIf you've never been on a date before, you've never kissed, you haven't done this or that then assume that they think you have. The cringiest things happen when people feel the need to tell someone what they are before they even ask: \"hey just so i let you know, im a virgin and i dont have friends\". You shoot yourself in the foot and expose yourself before you can even get the person to like you, and even worse you present these things that most people don't really think about as a big deal.\n\nHere's a test for you: imagine an average 20 something year old. What does he look like, what has he gone through in life, what can he do etc? If you are below average in things that aren't easily seen (face, body and whatnot), if someone doesn't know something about you then **they will assume average things.** Unless you look absolutely terrible (extremely fat, highly unkempt, body language is a wreck), people will think that you are average. While everyone strives to achieve perfection, and the closer you get to it better, **being average is perfectly fine.**\n\nSo how do you tell someone you're an old virgin? You don't, they'll assume that you're not. How to say you don't have friends? You don't.. why? Because most people have friends, therefore they will assume you do as well. The more you shut up, the better off you'll be. Talk normally, be funny and interesting and treat everyone like someone you want to talk to about stuff that interests you.\n\nOnce you assume that other people assume that you're not an utter whatever-bad-label-you-wish-to-put-on-yourself, you will act differently, more confidently and will actually cause your situation to be better. If you think they know; they don't. Trust me, people are highly clueless unless you're really obvious.",

I was completely devastated but at the same time, I sort of knew it was coming, I hadn’t taken the exams seriously at all and only revised a month or so before.\n\nAll my best friends went off to university and I was stuck back at home. My mum wanted to send me to Bulgaria to do the medicine course there (you can get in with lower grades) but I didn’t want to as I’d be so far and it was very expensive. She put me through the exam nevertheless and I failed by 2 marks. Then she enlisted me to college but they denied me because it was so late in the year and they said I should have come when I just recieved my results. My only option became what I thought of from the beginning (resitting my a levels at home) thankfully I contacted my old sixth form who said they can let me do my exams there for much cheaper than at a centre. \n\nSo now it’s February first and I’ve been trying to do some studying (watching videos and making notes) but I’ve realised that I am very slow and at this rate it would take me up until the exams to go through the content which can’t do because I need to go through all the past papers. My mum told me to ditch the videos and notes and just use past papers but when I try that I can’t seem to remember the content to answer the questions and end up needing to watch the video etc. I don’t know what to do in order to learn the most in the fastest amount of time. My exams are in June. \n\nTo give you a week of my life: I go gym 4/5 times a week for about 2 hours+.\nI go to work about 18 hours a week (weekends mainly but the odd weekday too)\nChurch on Sunday from 8:30-12am ish. \nI sleep around 11/12pm and wake up at 7/8am.\n\nMy goal is to understand the content and go over it enough times to remember, then do all the past papers available. I need AAA this time and I do think I am capable of it, I just need the right work in.\n\nHow should I go about this? 😅",

I recognized a long time ago that no matter what bad thing I identify, I always end up continuing the bad habits and behavior and take a path of inaction.\n\nI am married, have an incredible 2-year-old girl, and in a handful of months, another kid. I since turning 30 have noticed a few noticeable health concerns that could be nothing but could end up being much more. Could end up meaning a much shorter lifespan than I'd like. I know that unless my body starts dramatically failing on me I likely won't make any changes or at least not lasting changes.\n\nMy question is has anyone had issues where you recognized issues with your health or anything else in your life and just accepted to do nothing about it or even double down on bad habits at times even when you fully understand you need to make a change for your own or families benefit? And if so how did you manage to improve your situation in a lasting way?\n\nThanks,",

My 'friends' have mocked me all my school time and I have lost all my self confidence. I feel very very frightened to even go out of house . I only feel secure at home or with elder people ( they don't care about looks ) . The way people have treated me has made me better especially after age 16 . Earlier I was a very outgoing type of kid but then my height growth stopped and I started balding . Its not that my family is short . Only I am the short one . Even my younger brother is 182 cm and full head of dense hair . Probably I got the worst genes of my mom and dad. Although I was good at studies ( never scored less than 90) , I have no self confidence in me . \n\nI get anxiety if I am outside the house somewhere  whenever I see somebody. I consciously avoid eye contact and avoid meeting people due to my looks . When I have to attend some parties / gathering , I am anxious and self conscious all the time . And even after just 2 hours , all my energy is over and headache starts . I can't get over the fact that I am short, bald and ugly . I tried to talk to my parents , but seems they are very much bluepilled. They have this idealistic idea ( looks don't matter and how you act matters )\n\nI have no idea what I shoud do about this 😔\nMy anxiety and feeling can't be expressed by words .

I'm young, I needed the money so I told myself it was worth it.\n\nNow I'm so burnt out that I am constantly exhausted. I got a different job, and the mandatory hours are extremely reduced - except they still call out for OT all the time. My plan was to continue picking up OT, but I'm so tired that I just want 2 weeks off. I don't even want to go on vacation, I just want to be at home and do nothing. \n\nSo I tried taking more time off (only worked four 8 hour shifts last week, and took 3 days off). I'm still tired. If it's even possible - I'm MORE tired. But when I didn't pick up on my 3 days off, I felt a sense of restlessness and guilt. Like I should be working, even though I know I need the break and can take it. I don't even need to call in sick - I'm just not scheduled. But in my mind, I feel this compulsion to pick up, and when I don't, I can't fully relax despite knowing that I should be?\n\nIs this something that will just resolve in time if I work less? Any tips? I hate knowing what I SHOULD feel, but not feeling that way. Thanks. I miss when I had energy to do things and enjoy my life.",

I had a couple opportunities in the past to lose my virginity but i was a shy kid that didn't have any confidence at all but girls showed interest in me. At age 18 i discovered nofap which really increases my confidence but the problem is theres nothing to use that confidence. Back then i was in school and would encounter females on a daily basis. Right now i work and have no friends and all my co workers are older than me anyway so i can't make friends with them as we have nothing in common. Tried online dating apps too with not much luck at all but im not sure why as i would say im average looking and am in good shape. I really regret not having sex early when i was younger i wish could go back in time and change that but i can't and now im in this situation. Sex is always on my mind and what is making it even worse is that i have a younger brother who is 16 and i know for a fact he is sexually active. I think i might just a hire a hooker at this point because im at the end of my options right now. I have no friends either so going out isn't an option.",

        "text": "I, (17F) am a very soon-to-be graduating senior in high school. Throughout the majority of my high school career, I never felt necessarily accepted due to what I believe, is because I moved and attended my high school for the first time during my freshman year, which was shortly ruined due to Covid. I was only able to return to high school during my Junior year.\nThis has led me to not know the majority of people who attended my school, and I feel that I am targeted as a result. I as well feel that it’s because I do not feel like I belong to my current generation. I hate our slang, style, and especially our attitudes, which has led me to develop much more of a proper attitude than most. People tend to treat me differently simply because I’m quiet or too awkward when given any ounce of attention. I cannot do anything without being “targeted” because of this.\nEarlier today, I was working on a poster within a group, and a girl in the group beside me said that she needed a yellow pencil, which was a pencil I just so happened to have. I gave her the pencil which in response, sparked the reaction of a popular girl in my group (18F) to speak to me as if I were a child, in a voice that you would use with a child, all but in a passive-aggressive manner.\nShe said…\n“Oh, my Godd! JGP81795, you’re so niceee— Augh! I could neverrr!” \nI do not know why she felt the need to say this, but this is only one example from many others that have occurred nearly every day these past two years.\nI am not a child, and if anything I am by far from it.\nAt the moment academic-wise, I’m a 4.0 GPA Cross Country Varsity Captain and have received a full-ride scholarship to my wanted college where I will peruse a dual major in secondary education and history.  I will as well be enrolling in its AROTC (Army Reserve Officers Training Corps) Program. In the real world, I’m a manager that runs a dairy farm. I milk cows, operate machinery, and renovate my boss's property for when the milk inspector comes.\nI want the respect that I know I deserve. \nSimply because I choose not the follow my generation's ways, and rather chose to be my individual does not me I do not deserve any less respect than I should be given.\nI know that if I do not take a stand or anything about this, this treatment will continue. \nSo with that said…\nHow do I not become a target?",

        "text": "So this past weekend, i went on an escape room with some haunted house coworkers i had not seen in a couple months.  I was overwhelmed with excitement, to see a couple of people (only 2 could make it).  I was lively, talkative, and just so happy to see these 2 people i hadn't seen in too long!  Once our time to begin the escape room, came  , we entered the room, and when I saw it was just a small room, with not much else to it, I got a bad feeling in my stomach, that maybe this group activity was not going to be my cup of tea.  \n\nThe escape room consisted of finding clues, which lead to more clues, ultimately to try to find a hidden bomb.  This involved thinking, concentration, engagement, and problem-solving, things that i intensely struggle with.  but ultimately at the beginning, I just said to myself \"relax man, this is the lowest stakes a group project can get.  Just have fun, and try your best\".    \n\nSo i was going to try to go into it with that mindset, and just be the best I could and have fun with it with these 2 other people i loved and missed.  But once it started, about 5 minutes in, things started to go downhill for me, fast.  I quickly felt like i was falling behind, as the other 2 picked up on clue after clue after clue, while i became increasingly... clueless.  I felt a dreadful sense feeling of uselessness overcome me, as they were just flowing along with it, step by step, while i helplessly watched in the background.  I was doing everything i could to pretend i was going along with it too and tried to help in any way i could.  But I became totally checked out and felt completely useless a mere halfway through.  I stopped talking and lost nearly all of my personality i had just a half hour ago.  What was supposed to be a fun night to bond with some people i had not seen a couple of months turned into a painful feeling of total failure and stupidity for me (thankfully I think all of their attention was heavily focused on the project at hand, and not on me dying inside).   I stopped talking, and said dumb things to just say anything, anything, instead of nothing, trying to hide what was really going on inside of me, which was: \"all of the stones in this small room have already been unturned. I have nothing to offer here.  I am now completely useless\".  So I spent the last 20 minutes or so watching the clock tick down, dying for it to be over.  But in the end, I did really admire what they did, and I really had no idea how they did it.      \n\nThis type of thing that i experienced here is something I have experienced so many times in my life when in group projects: the feeling of being at the bottom of the pile, that my intellect and gifts are of no use, and i am forced to withdraw into the background and go silent, while intensely envying the seemingly effortless grace the others in the group seem to possess.  These experiences are always profoundly painful because i feel like there is something very wrong with me, and a strong inferiority complex overcomes me.  And thus i have spendt a lot of my life avoiding being in these types of group activities for this reason, to avoid this pain.   \n\nSo i was wondering how can one deal with this feeling of being useless and worthless in group projects, and how to do better at it.",

Not only that my parents being immigrants to a country (ivy league educated)-   \n\n\nI realized no matter how much  I was \"being myself\" - no matter how cool or how much achievements I had- I wasn't going to be popular because of my parents financial circumstances and their social standing in society.   \n\n\nComing to realization that is the truth hurts. When I was 16; I wanted to know why girls weren't attracted to me- or why I wasnt popular; and unfortauntely 90% of it wasn't determined by me. It was determined by my parents circumstances.  My parents being Asian, immigrants- who didn't value social life and instead told me work hard in my studies- practice piano and martial arts- do intensive extra circulars- has not made me any popular-   \n\n\nand the very reason of this culture that I have been a failing adult.   \n\n\nI set to change this.

But to start, I am a 23yo male, currently pursuing my undergrad for pre-law criminology because I want to be a civil rights attorney. I feel that everyone has rights and I want to make sure they are upheld. I took a year and a half break between my sophomore and Junior year which really helped in growing and maturing. I had an absolutely terrible childhood, I was taken from a drug addict mom at 5 where I suffered much psychological and even sexual abuse and was taken in by my dad who would physically and mentally abuse me until we would stop contact around the time I was 18. I had a very successful high school and even a little post high school wrestling career and am now a very highly ranked powerlifter. I feel that if I got anything out of those experiences it was to be make myself into the strongest version of myself. However, I feel that I am extremely mentally weak. I question everything I do, I barely want to get out of bed, I get really good grades but I find that I’m barely applying myself. I feel like I’m empty all the time. Sometimes I want to scream, sometimes I want to cry, sometimes I put on a face that nothing is wrong. I have a fiancé that loves and support me but I worry that this is too much of a burden on her sometimes. I developed a masturbation addiction at a young age because it was the only source of pleasure I got out of life and now I’m afraid I’ll never break the habit. I just wish I had parents in my life or at least some guidance. I go to therapy and that’s great but I can barely afford it. Are there anyways I can train my mind to become stronger? I apologize for the wall of text lol\n\nTLDR; Was abused most of my life and don’t have any parents at the age of 23, I’m physically strong but want to learn how to be mentally strong as well.",

But even other than that, I feel like my insecurities are slowly leaking out of their cage. Someone could be like “I got 81% on my exam” and I’ll be fucking eye twitching contemplating how the hell they did better than me bc they’re stupid and I’m way smarter blah blah and the whole time I got 80%. \n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed recently is, I won’t help someone if I fell that they aren’t worth it. We were working on our projects and we had to look for inspiration and I found some pretty good sources but one of my friends tried for 5 minutes before asking me for mine and I said no. However my other friend asked and I was like sure bc I knew that she would do good with it. \n\nIdk, I feel that I’m being insecure in the way that I don’t want people to be better than me. Like I’m in a constant silent competition with too any people and it’s ridiculous. Is it because im 16? I feel that I’m fairly mature for my age. Is it an environment thing?

        "text": "I've been working at my current job for about a year. When I first started working there I quickly learned an acquaintance I have known for a few years was one of the managers. We met in 2018 at a community event/ party. I vibed with him really well and loved his down to earth and gentle personality.\n\nSince then we'd keep in contact briefly through text once in a while. One day I tried reaching out to him by calling him just to check in and say hi (how friends are made I assume) and I never got a call back. I also left him a voicemail. \n\nI was a little upset about it but proceeded to move on. Through my year of working with him I felt he treated me as more of a subordinate than a younger brother (He's 10 years older than me )by making some ridiculous commands and requests. (We are also both a minority from Ghana) Because of this I felt a little bit of underlying resentments towards him. Although we occasionally have a light hearted chuckle and conversation here and there it seems fake and forced. I feel we could have been like family but he doesn't feel I'm on his level (especially agewise) \n\nMy concern is often times I come to work and don't say hi to him but eventually have to converse with him because of work related things. I have a feeling it hurts his feelings, especially because a few months ago he expressed what seemed to be his unhappiness to the fact that I don't ever say hello to him and to be honest it was kind of intentional because I wasn't really feeling him.\n\nI feel I should let go of my grieviances with him but often times he may do something that irritates and disappoints me and then I'm back to square one about how I feel about him. I'm honestly a relatively friendly person and often am quick to say hi to a friend, But since I have some disappointment and resentment towards him I just don't. I don't know if I'm missing out on a potential friendship by not being friendly enough but as the older person I feel the ball is more in his court. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "Dear All,\n\nI’ve reached a point where I really feel like my life isn’t how it should. For a bit of context, I am a male in my early 20s.\n\nFirst  of all, I’m unable to relax or to find any kind of hobbies. My whole  day revolves around working for my university studies. I’m really good  at it and it will probably offer me a very strong starting point for my  career, but I feel like it’s not enough. I don’t have any  hobbies/passions. Almost all the time left I waste randomly surfing the  internet. I can’t even get myself to read a book or watch a movie  without it feeling like a chore. I’ve tried to start some different  hobbies (running, going to the gym, juggling, drawing) but I get bored  really fast and I can’t keep it for more than a few days. I also tried  meditation, both guided and unguided. Unfortunately I can’t see any kind  of benefit, which strongly discourages me.\n\nSecond,  I feel like I’m a weird person, unable to form deep friendships. I see  lots of people around me know each other, become friends and keep their  friendships for a lot of time, even at a distance. I can’t do that. I  meet people, we seem to get along, but we can’t form any deeper  connection and, after some time, they become cold, respond less and  less, until they stop talking at all. I don’t think I am a bad person,  it’s just that I can’t connect no matter what I try (I try hang out with  them, text them, send them funny/interesting stuff etc.). I always  remain an outcast.\n\nThirdly, am not  good at talking/expressing myself. While I’m certain I know stuff, I  don’t know how to tell it to people in an interesting and engaging way. I  don’t know how to tell it as a story, in a way that would make someone  not say “whatever” after a few seconds. Every time I see someone doing  this, I am deeply unhappy, and I can’t understand why it’s impossible  for me.\n\nWere you in similar situations? Do you have any ideas of what I could do?\n\nVent over.",

(If not appropriate here, a suggestion of where it may be more appropriate would be very much appreciated)\n\nI'm keen to understand how we can better enable feedback and personal growth either in a job role as we grow through our careers or generally.\n\nDisclosure : I am asking these questions because I have an idea for a software app that could help with this and I'm hoping this can be part of my market research as this is a community of individuals who are focussed on improvement and moving forward.\n\nWe get feedback in a number of ways at present:\n\n\\-Direct informal feedback from managers, peers or team members on an ad-hoc basis\n\n\\-Direct feedback from trainers when new to a job/career/role.\n\n\\-More formal feedback in development meetings, 1:1s from team leader/manager.\n\n\\-Structured formal feedback annually or on an ad-hoc basis from a structured 360 review.\n\n\\-Other corporate tools and communication methods where informal feedback/shout outs might occur.\n\n\\-Personal feedback from friends/family etc in conversations whether asked for or not :-)\n\nMy thought is that we are generally not in control of this feedback and it is at best sporadic and driven by your someone elses timetable.  I'm thinking of a way of easily sending a feedback request for specific actions etc to help us grow and respond to this 'micro-feedback' quickly and effectively.\n\nI'm keen to understand thoughts on any of these questions/points please.\n\n\\-Are you aware of an app that is individually driven to request specific feedback from managers, peers, colleagues, friends, family or direct reports, team members etc.  I have a list of feedback apps but they appear to be more for companies to query their staff or businesses to query their customers.  I'm thinking about us driving this for personal growth feedback for our own purposes.\n\n\\-How do you currently ask for feedback?\n\n\\-How often do you ask for feedback?\n\n\\-In what circumstances do you ask for feedback?  (e.g. just completed a piece of work or a project, just initiated a new meeting, made a change to existing process?)\n\n\\-Do you find it easy to ask for feedback?\n\n\\-Do you consider this feedback to essential for your personal growth and improvement?\n\n\\-Do you circle back to the person providing feedback with a response/update?\n\n\\-What kind of questions do you ask?\n\n\\-Would a set of canned questions based on the circumstance be helpful?\n\n\\-Would you use an app to assist with this?  I'm thinking it would send a link to get micro-feedback.  Questions could be canned or customisable.\n\n\\-Would you add a link to your email signature/IM bio to enable anytime/immediate feedback\n\n\\-Is anonymous feedback important to you?  \n\n\\-Would you respond to a request for feedback if you got it in an email with a link?  What if you could control whether it was anonymous or not?\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated and I'm keen to hear it; positive, negative or meh!\n\nThanks\n\nRTS",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10q8c4j/how_to_keep_your_momentum_in_blurry_world/",
        "text": " \n\n### What Does a \"Blurry\" World Mean, and How Can We Maintain Momentum?\n\nIn a world of constant change, it is important to maintain momentum and remain focused on the future. But with so many unknowns, it can be difficult to know where to focus our energy.\n\nThe concept of a “blurry” world seeks to provide clarity in this uncertain landscape by helping us understand how the future may unfold and what we can do now to prepare for it.\n\nBy understanding the potential implications of this blurry world, we can make informed decisions that will help us maintain our momentum and stay ahead of the curve.\n\n### Learning How to Stay Flexible in an Unpredictable Environment\n\nIn today's unpredictable environment, it is essential to stay flexible in order to adapt to changes. Learning how to adjust quickly and efficiently can be a challenge, but with the right strategies and mindset, it is possible to remain agile and resilient in the face of adversity.\n\n**Here are three strategies that help to ensure one can remain agile and resilient in the face of adversity.**\n\n1. Embrace change: Many people try to avoid change and find comfort in the familiar, which is a common way of dealing with stress and anxiety. However, embracing change means being open-minded about new experiences, as well as taking risks to grow as an individual.\n\n2. Stay optimistic: The ability to remain optimistic in the face of adversity is a fundamental component of staying agile and resilient. Optimism helps people to feel less overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, and it also helps them to see solutions where others might perceive only problems.\n\n3. Reduce distractions: The distractions that come with modern life can be pretty overwhelming and overstimulating. To combat this, it is best to remove oneself from the chaos, find time for self-care, and focus on tasks at hand.\n\n### Identifying and Letting go of Negative Thinking Patterns That Undermine Your Momentum\n\nNegative thinking patterns can have a profound effect on our lives, often leading to feelings of insecurity, fear, and doubt. It is important to recognize when we are thinking negatively and take steps to let go of these patterns so that we can move forward with more confidence and momentum.\n\n**Here are some tips to let go your paradox and start moving forward**\n\n1 Realize that negative thoughts are common.\n\n2. Recognize the pattern- when a negative thought comes up, ask yourself if it is true or not- how many times have you had this thought? When were you last successful with this type of thinking?\n\n3. Notice your patterns- What are the main ideas in your head when you start thinking negatively? What types of situations do these thoughts usually occur in? What triggers them to come up most often?\n\n4. Take small steps forward- what small thing can you do today that will help you move forward and out of these thoughts more easily tomorrow or later.\n\n### How to Keep Your Momentum When the World is blurry\n\nThe world can be a tricky place to navigate, and it can be hard to stay motivated when it feels like everything is blurry. But no matter what life throws at us, it's important to remember that we have the power to keep our momentum going.\n\n**Here are four effective strategies**\n\nStrategy 1: Establish Clear Goals and Make a Plan\n\nStrategy 2: Prioritize Self-Care and Make Time for Mindful Breaks\n\nStrategy 3: Take Small Steps &amp; Celebrate Your Progress\n\nStrategy 4 Find Support from Others &amp; Connect with Your Community\n\n### Understanding the Power of Quick Wins and Celebrating Every Achievement\n\nQuick wins are powerful tools to help us stay motivated and achieve our goals. They give us a sense of accomplishment and progress, which can help us stay on track towards our bigger objectives. Celebrating every achievement is an important part of the process as it helps us to recognize our successes, no matter how small they may be.\n\nQuick wins also provide a great opportunity to build relationships with colleagues and partners as we work together to reach our goals.\n\nBy understanding the power of quick wins and celebrating every achievement, we can create an environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated for their contributions.\n\n### How keeping it low is vital for continued success\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life and forget that keeping it low is still an important part of long-term success.\n\nKeeping it low means being mindful of your actions, attitude, and behavior so that you can remain focused on your goals and avoid distractions and exaggerating grandiosity from your side.\n\nBy taking the time to reflect on our decisions and practice self-care, we can ensure that we are always making the best decisions for ourselves and our future success.\n\n### Finding Support from Others During Tough Times\n\nEveryone goes through tough times, and it is important to know that you are not alone. It can be helpful to reach out to others for support during these difficult times. By connecting with family, friends, and other people in your life who have experienced similar struggles, you can find solace in knowing that you are not alone.\n\nFurthermore, seeking help from professionals such as therapists or coaches can provide valuable insight into how to cope with the challenges that life throws at us. Through supportive relationships and professional guidance, we can find ways to navigate through tough times and come out stronger on the other side.\n\n### Conclusion: Practicing mindfulness to relieve stress is essential in order to have a peaceful mind and regain momentum.\n\nMindfulness is an important practice that helps us to stay in the present moment and be aware of our thoughts, feelings, and actions. It can help us to reduce stress and anxiety, improve our focus, and find peace of mind.\n\nMindfulness can also help us to regain our momentum when we feel overwhelmed or stuck in a rut. By taking time to pause, reflect on our emotions and thoughts, we can better understand why we are feeling stressed or anxious and take steps towards finding a sense of calmness.\n\nPracticing mindfulness regularly can help us develop healthier habits that will lead to long-term emotional wellbeing.\n\n### Here are some stress relief tips\n\n1 . Take a deep breath.\n\n2. Focus on the present moment\n\n3. Engage in calming activities, for instance, yoga or exercise\n\n4. Eat healthy and sleep well\n\n5. Connect with friends and family",

        "text": "Hi, as the top line says I’m new to this. I know nobody will care but I’ve become really depressed, I have no friends outside of acquaintances, I don’t have any family members that actually care, my girlfriend always argues with me so I can’t tell her what’s going on and my kids are too young to understand/care. I only post this because I’ve got nowhere else to go, I’ve been contemplating ending it all but I can’t bring myself to do it because I’m a fucking coward and don’t have the balls to, I don’t know what to do anymore! Nothing helps, I’ve spoken to people who will barely tolerate me, those I thought were friends go and fuck me over the first chance they get. My old babysitter tried to flirt with my gf, my brother straight up ignores my existence. My kids barely want to do anything with me at all they prefer to do everything with their mum, while I have to sit there watching and feeling like I don’t belong, I know I have a mental health condition but I can’t get it diagnosed because the doctors won’t see me or take me seriously because I’m a man, we’re not allowed to have emotions and actual cognitive thoughts or be self conscious, am I wrong for being this way? Am I a failure to my kids? I feel like I am.\n\n\n\nAnyone who made it this far and read this thank you, you’re greatly appreciated. Im also sorry too if I’ve wasted anyones time but I needed to vent and honestly anonymously online is the only place I know that I can do this type of thing.\nIt’s my first time but if you want to abuse me/call me names and say I’m pathetic then go ahead, I’m pretty much used to it by now",

Comes over, and neatly folded his jacket and places it on top of mine. He has never done it to anyone before. I told him \"hey could you take that off, I find it disrespectful\". He laughs at me and replies \"Do you want to place it on top of mine instead\", I smiled and disengaged.  I have only had one conversation with him and his friend, about where we are from. We are of the same background if that's important. Was he trying to test me? \n\nYou guys think it's disrespectful right? It's not a cultural thing, even his friend said. Why was he trying to start on me? People like him gives me anxiety. I don't want to go back and meet him again. Maybe I'm a target for bullies. I'm 6ft 6 btw and I've been told I'm too nice. Do people try to mess with tall people like me or am I overthinking? I just don't understand why this stranger started on me.",

        "text": "I realized there is a major issue with me that I've developed become of my upbringing. I care too much. I believe in concepts like loyalty and sacrifice. I feel like this affects my ability to have relationships both romantic and platonic because ,essentially, I catch too many feelings. This isn't a vent from some poor damaged person though I am. its just an observation I've acquired not just from my last relationship but just seeing others both peer and friend behave. \n\nWhen my relationships fall through I'm devastated for months, even years I don't forget I take it very personally but in this world people navigate through relationship apps and dating like they're window shopping new products and replace them just as quick without a second thought. \"Oh my bf broke up with me, I'll just get a new one next month\" like its a minor inconvenience. \n\nI've found people would much quicker just find and replace you then accept flaws or try to help with them. Pawn you off to therapy without a second thought or 'cut you off' if you even slightly inconvenience their direction in life. \n\nI want to be like that. I want to learn how to treat people merely as extensions to my own narrative. I want to learn how to look at my relationships as accessories to swap and replace like outdated technology.   \n\nI want to learn how to be less sentimental and caught up on others. \n\n(Wow reading that it really did seem like a emotional vent.. I would rather advice rather then emotional support though)",

        "text": "For context, I come from a family with a neglectful father and an abusive mother, as well as distant relatives who don't care about me. I was an extremely introverted kid all throughout middle school and never had any friends. So throughout most of my life after my brother's death, I was a lonely kid who had no one to talk to except for my few cousins. I had a few online friends from various fandoms who I used to be close to. Back then, I had a crush on a guy in school who was so out of my league. I was really shy to talk to him, but because he was a popular extrovert, he always came over to help me and make sure I never felt lonely. I confessed to him, and to my surprise, he said yes. I was overjoyed, and the last few months flew by like a happy dream. But since having a boyfriend is extremely looked down upon where I live, my relatives and neighbors began gossiping about me being a slut who chased after the first rich guy I saw. I felt isolated, and I started avoiding my cousins and my online friends and started to talk only to my boyfriend about every single problem in my life. \n\nI trusted my boyfriend since he was the only person who appreciated me and gave me company all throughout my life. In this world, I adored him the most. And I spent all my free time either texting or hanging out with him in fear he'd abandon me the moment he found me boring and plain, as everyone did. Slowly, I became too busy to hang out with my other friends, cousins, or family. I spent all my free time engrossed in spending more time with him. So one by one, my friends started t ditch me and started to complain, all I do is talk about him and that I am a brat who feels too cool to hang out with them again. So most of my friends went their separate ways, but I didn't mind it too much, thinking it was fine if everyone left; at least I still have him. But one day, the moment I started to realize that my attachment was toxic was when I became too busy to hang out with anyone but him. He told me about the funny memes his female friends sent him and how much his male friends praised him to the heavens for his test scores. \n\nI was surprised to notice how many friends he still had other than me and how much happier he was compared to me. He had everyone. Seeing all the memes his friends sent, I realized I was overly reliant on him and that something as trivial as that was bothering me. As I didn't want my jealousy to go out of control, I kept my distance from my BF at school to hang out with someone else, but I soon realized that I had no one else. I drove away what little friends I had, and I ultimately came back to him, stating my dilemma, but he brushed it off and said it's fine that you are clingy to me and can hang out with no one else. That way, I am proving my loyalty to him, and even if I had no one else, he would forever remain by my side. But this still bothers me. **I also want to have a happy life outside of him so that I don't suffocate him with my presence, and so that I can improve my life and be with him without making our relationship toxic or sour due to my unhealthy co-dependency issues.** I wish to improve my life; how do I go about it?",
