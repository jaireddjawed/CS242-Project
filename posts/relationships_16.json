Last year he visited me, he asked me in return to come see him in his city next year (he lives in the middle of nowhere).\n\nFast forward 1 year, I travel to his place and finally discover where he lives. But when he opened the door I was in a bit of a shock. I'm not the tidiest person myself but what I saw was nothing I expected :\n\nIt was very messy and hard to walk through everything on the ground. There was a lot of trash and boxes/cartons. Looking at the kitchen it was full of old bottles and a lot of flies (that he sprayed 2 times a day to kill) plus brown stains on the furnitures all around. Dust and hair everywhere... just general messiness and poor hygiene... despite him telling me he cleaned before I arrived.\n\nI feel like a b*tch for complaining but I have concern for his well being and I dont know how to voice my worries to him without making him feel bad. He mentionned he wants to invite people over but I feel like its gonna ruin his social life.\n\nHow do I tell my best friend that his place is too messy without hurting his feelings ?\n\nTLDR : My friend's appartment is in an unpresentable state to invite someone over. How do I tell him ?",

        "text": " \n\nHi guys,\n\nI (m31) am married to my wife (f30) for almost two years, we were two years before that a couple. She is a really active person and is working for a charity. Last week there was a event, where I accompanied her.\n\nI am blatantly honest with you guys. I never had the desire to check my wifes phone, but I saw that a guy (m around 38-40) messaged her and got really jealous and curious what was it about. I know it is not a good thing to do, I am a ass\\*ole, but currently we also fight to get pregnant and got the results that my sperm count is too low, which impacted my self esteem negatively. This guy is the president of this charity and the message was basically about another guy (m32, brother of the older guy), which my wife met a couple times before I got to know her. .. I digged deeper and saw that she was highly in love with this dude, but this dude rejected her. Shortly after the rejection we got to know each other.\n\nThe message was a voice message where president (m around 38-40) asked if she wants to join the event, since he knows about the situation with the other dude (m32). I respect that and for me it was a nice thing that he asked her. My wife replied that she wants to join, since the charity \"is her first love\".\n\nSo I am in a situation right now where I dont know what to do. Everyone in this charity knows about the situation and I went there without knowing about this situation.. I feel really betrayed, like I am a clown, which maybe is result of my self esteem. I can not classify this. Either my wife had to tell me about this situation or just dont participate.\n\nIt is really having a toll on my self esteem.\n\nShould I talk with my wife or should I just digest this?\n\nTLDR: Wife (f30) and me (m31) went on a event where a dude (m32) she was in love with also went. Everyone from the organisation team knows about this. I feel betrayed and do not know what to do.\n\nEnglish is not my native language, so sorry for my mistakes.",

        "text": "So this might be a long one and if it is, I am sorry. There's a lot going on here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been with my bf for about 7 years now. Things were amazing to start with (as they so often are). He was the opposite to everything I had with my ex, who was emotionally abusive to me, didn't take time to understand my mental health struggles and basically neglected me towards the end of our relationship - dead bedroom etc. My bf seemed to understand me, and one of the first things I told him that in the past, I had dealt with some pretty horrible stuff in my life and was still working through them, that I would understand if it put him off and he reassured me that it didn't. That was when he told me he was a recovering alcoholic and had been sober for about 4 years. I told him that was also fine, but if he drank, I wouldn't stay with him as I was also sober. So happily, we got together. Things were going great for the first few years. Holidays away together. Days out. No tension at all. He helped me through the loss of a grandparent and a cancer diagnosis of an immediate family member too. I couldn't have asked for a better partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I noticed that he had some issues of his own, which is fine, or seemed fine to start with. They would come in little flickers, e.g. getting needlessly angry about food slightly burning - him exclaiming it was ruined and slamming things about in the kitchen, despite me saying the food still looked and tasted fine. One time, he snapped a wooden spoon in half and threw it while screaming. It was quite scary and mortifying to see him break down over dinner being slightly over cooked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also started expressing anxiety more - if we had to go to parties and things like that, he would get a twitch and when we got there he would just stand awkwardly and not interact with anyone. As well as this, he has quite bad health anxiety and has on many occasions convinced himself he was dying, had an incurable skin disease or that he had early signs of MND. There was a period of time where when he was experiencing one of these bouts of panic, that he couldn't focus on anything else \\*but\\* that and kind of pushed me aside, and I think that was one of the first times I felt quite hurt by him. I told him to get checked by a doctor, but he left it for weeks, if not months in some cases, and as soon as the doc told him that he was completely fine, it drifted away as if nothing happened and he laughed about it. I didn't find it funny. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also had crazy paranoia and anxiety about being accused of crimes he hasn't committed, as well as having his identity stolen. If he gets a phishing email, it sends him into a doom spiral and he has panic attacks over it. Again, I have told him to get help for it, and try to reassure him. I once tried to hug him after a bad one and he pushed me away and walked off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring our time together, I have really put the work in to try and better myself. Back when I was really sick, they had given me a few months to live, but I ate more and gained a healthy relationship with food and mysef, started working out and managed to get a full time job I wanted. Things I never expected myself to be able to do, I was achieving them and feel immensely proud of myself for getting to this point. I haven't been depressed in years, not completely, and I can't remember the last time I had a panic attack. I am also now off my medication and am managing to stave off any bad times by talking about it, working out and eating as good as I can. I have bad days just as anyone else does, but it no longer feels like drudgery. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we bought a house together as things seemed to be improving and his bad moods seemed to ebb away. He seemed excited and I was too. But this is where he seems to think everything went wrong, and that this is when I changed. And I probably have changed. I feel much more confident in myself these days and tend to march to the beat of my own drum obviously while considering his thoughts and opinions on things, but I don't think that sits well with him. It seems to be a struggle for him. Some examples of this are the following\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\- He once got really upset with me because a lot of the stuff we used to decorate the house with were my belongings. That he felt the house was mostly mine because of that despite us paying or it exactly even. He hadn't bought anything to personalise any of the space with so I put my things up so the walls weren't bare and it felt homely. I asked him if he'd like me to take some stuff down and he said no, he also said no to wanting to go and pick some stuff up he wanted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He wouldn't let me put a roller blind up in the kitchen for privacy at night because 'that's not what he did at home' and he says it's 'weird'. Same for the living room, so we have this ugly ass net thing up over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- We need a new kitchen and when I said my mom's bf could fit it for free (he renovates houses) if we bought the supplies, he got pissy with me stating I was ignoring his suggestion of paying to get it done 'properly'. He can afford to do that more than I can as I earn a lot less than him, so I thought it would be better if we got my mom's bf to do it for us. Apparently this was me cockblocking him and making him feel his opinions didn't matter when I asked him for his suggestion and put forward that I just thought it would save us a couple of thousand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He is a musician so plays a lot of different instruments. One includes a piano which he can plug headphones into. Said piano is right against the shared wall between us and our neighbor. He would often play it out loud late at night, and when I told him to turn it down and that the neighbors might complain (they're older than us and have kids), he flipped his shit and said I was trying to control him. Similar happened when he brought an electric drum kit home and he set it up on some wooden floor in the same room. The thud of the bass pedal and all the rest of it was obnoxiously loud, so again, I asked if we could maybe move it elsewhere just to lessen the noise a bit, emphasising that I wasn't tell him not to play, just the placement of it wasn't ideal. He, again, went crazy at me. Said I am always trying to ruin his fun. Same goes for when he plays guitar at 7am in the morning on my days off from work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother issue is cleanliness. People have different standards, I understand that. But his are pretty low. He's quite happy to have crumbs and things everywhere, splatters all over the microwave and stove top. Dirty sink. Dirty tub. His bedroom (we don't share rooms as we work different shifts) smells musty and you can barely see the floor. I've tried cleaning it once or twice, but that was met with me getting an earful, being accused of 'moving' things and being told that it doesn't need doing (the inch thick of beard clippings on the side say otherwise). He complained that I didn't do the dishes or empty the trash as much as he did, and admittedly I didn't, so I've started doing those now on the promise he would start helping me out with what are supposedly my jobs AKA cleaning the whole house on my days off. That hasn't happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this is probably the meat of our issues here. I am currently awaiting diagnosis for Autism and possibly ADHD. The process has been very long and drawn out but I am on a waiting list to be seen. This started last year, and when I first brought it up with him, I got the feeling like he thought I was looking for excuses or a get out of jail free card for any of my quirks of behaviours - I am quite blunt, I struggle with some lines of communication, I get overwhelmed easily and I am constantly beating myself up for doing things wrong or for taking on other people's mistakes and treating them as my own, like I deserve to feel that way. Anyway. I want to get to the bottom of this and see if these and the many more things I have going on in my head align with this diagnosis. He knows this. I speak about it often. So when we argue, my mind goes blank and I really have a hard time trying to convey my thoughts and feelings in a way that he understands which usually ends up in me crying in frustration and apologising for things I haven't done, things he should apologise for. This always results in him saying I need therapy and that I should pay for it. I can't afford to pay for it, which is why I put myself on this waiting list to be seen. But he pulls this out every time, and whenever I have flipped it back on him, saying I think he needs to see someone. He always ignores it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is despite him saying he's depressed, is anxious, hates people but wishes he had friends (on this point, I've been trying to make friends and join social groups, but I am worried if I go to them, he'll get jealous and upset because he won't do the same for himself), says he struggles to talk to people (his workplace have picked up on this and he tells me he can go a whole day without saying a word to anyone in the office) and seems paranoid about everything and my intentions. He can't take any criticism at all (something I am also working on for myself, being in this relationship has tested that) and he has told me that I hold him to a very high standard and that he feels he can never reach it, that he's constantly panicking that he will never make me happy (he does, when this shit isn't happening which at this point is about every 2 weeks). He puts himself under this pressure, pressure I've told him he doesn't need as I am very easily pleased and quite easy going with most things. It makes me second guess my actions, makes me feel like I'm going crazy that maybe I did say or do something without meaning to, or that the specific intonation of my voice wasn't the right one to use. Things like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot is going on. Our sex life is quite dead as he is very easily wounded there too aka if I move his hand too many times, he gets offended and makes things awkward. Things like that. It really turns me off, along with everything else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do or think any more. I feel like he hates me but is staying out of convenience or doesn't want to go through the trouble of splitting and selling up. I've asked him if he loves me and he says yes, but my ex did the same then dumped me hours later. I've been making much more effort to arrange things like date night (which he initially said was stupid, that we should just naturally do that, but we hadn't. For years), days out, spending more time together. But I always feel like there's this tension with him, and I'm always waiting for the thread to snap and us to argue. I do love him, he's considerate, does things like cooking and the grocery shop and things like that. But my confidence is in the pits, I am anxious about speaking to him about issues in case I'm told I'm over reacting or need therapy. I sometime just think of hopping in my car and driving away, but I would feel so bad about it as well. Feel like I'm stuck in some kind of limbo and I guess I'm putting this out there in hopes it makes me feel better. I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading. Sorry it was so long.   \n\n\ntl;dr - Boyfriend keeps making me feel shitty and telling me to see a therapist for my shit (am on a waiting list to see one as I can't afford private) when he should also probably go and see one for all of his problems too. It's eating our relationship alive and I don't know what to do.",

Before high school he decided he wants to run his IT company because he’s very good at programming and he left school. \n\nFew years later, he started to earn some big money. At least that’s what he claimed. He was partying a lot and I was on a party with him once and he bought me everything including two Don P champagnes so I was like wow that guy is rich. I’ve never underestimated that.\n\nNow we are 25 and I, as well as some of our friends, started to see some bullshit. He claimed to have security because he has 1k+ size company which is nowhere to be seen on the internet, as well as security. He was talking about buying houses in different parts of the world million times now but he still lives with parents. Also he claimed that he bought very expensive car to his parents long time ago and lately I’ve seen them they were driving not so new Toyota.\n\nThere were more things from what I’ve mentioned. But when we were seeing each other for a lunch or party he was behaving very expensive, showing people his 17 million crypto portfolio which seemed legit and I think it is but he’s not as rich as he says. Nothing confirms it.\n\nSo I did the worst think I could do as I friend - I’ve texted his ex that I barely know and I asked her what she thinks about his career, without mentioning anything that I suspend. She said exactly what me and my friends were thinking.\n\nWhat should I do now? I’m doing businesses with this guy and he’s my best friend but he obviously is lying about his security, his private driver (that I’ve never met because every time I was in town he was free), his chef which I also never seen or his beautiful office in the city that I’ve never have even photo of.\n\nI see he has money. But way less that he claims. Not security, buying expensive apartments, private chef kind of money.\n\nI cannot tell him “hey I’ve texted your ex and she said this”. What should I do? I feel like this almost life long friendship was a lie.\n\ntl;dr: my best friend was lying to me for years",

        "text": "My boyfriend (20M) and I(22f) have been together for almost 2 years now. For the past year we’ve been dealing with his ex girlfriend harassing us and causing drama amongst their friend group ever since they broke up. A few months ago we found out my boyfriends brother was secretly dating one of her friends. I didn’t pay any mind to this and tried not to let it bother me because I felt uncomfortable that he was dating someone that was friends with someone (and is aware of her actions) that’s been harassing his brother and saying awful things about him and his family. But since I hardly ever got the chance to see his girlfriend I didn’t think we’d have any issues. \n\nFast forward to a few months later, after being humiliated and harassed by the ex for months, I decided to post on social media everything she did and all the lies she was spreading. Everything seemed to have resolved itself and things were peaceful for a few weeks. Until my boyfriends younger sibling sends me screenshots of messages from their brothers girlfriend talking about me. She brought up my social media posts and how I went too far with exposing his ex and that I shoudlve been the bigger person. Even after his younger sibling defended my actions and explained why I did that, she proceeded to defend the ex girlfriend and said that her actions were a reasonable reaction to being dumped and then went on to say that my boyfriend cheated on her with me, which is absolutely untrue. After being told this, my boyfriends sibling offered to open up a conversation so that I can have the chance to explain myself since his girlfriend was claiming that she’s only saying these things because she wants to know the whole story before picking sides, but she straight up said “no i’m okay” and refused to hear the truth from me personally. \n\nAfter my boyfriend had confronted her and his brother, she claimed that she was simply curious and isn’t friends with his ex at all and was just scared of how i’d react.  I brushed this off because I was exhausted at this point but then later came to find out that she had removed me from her social media and had his brother remove me as well. She never even apologized to me after finding out she was spreading false accusations or even acknowledged the damage she could’ve done to my relationship with my boyfriend and his family as well as my reputation. \n\nI feel as though this situation on top of dealing with his ex has forced me to do nothing but compromise my boundaries and it’s so draining. I’ve avoided going to family gatherings and events that I know she’ll be at because the situation has been so traumatic and being around her makes me feel angry and uncomfortable. And it hurts that his family just brushed off this entire situation. I’ve seen how this has played out with my mom and dads relationship and I really don’t want to end up in her shoes where she was constantly disrespected by his family. \n\nTLDR; My boyfriends brothers girlfriend was spreading false accusations that my boyfriend was cheating on his ex with me and she hasn’t apologized and his family hasn’t acknowledged the damage she’s done, should I take this as a red flag and leave?",

        "text": "I'm (29f) struggling to determine how I truly feel about my boyfriend (29m) of two years. While he sees me as the one he wants to marry, I have expressed my fears and uncertainties about the future. I'm not even sure if I genuinely love him. Most of the time, when I say \"I love you\" in response to him saying it first, it's out of obligation and fear of ruining the moment if I don't reciprocate, which has happened before. \nI've found myself focusing on our differences as individuals, which has made it difficult for me to appreciate them instead. The more I ignore them and keep an open mind the more unintentionally magnified they get and cause conflict. I'm questioning if these differences whether big or small, can work in a relationship. For example, when we go out, he likes to eat quickly and take a walk to digest right after while I prefer to take my time, savor my food, and have a conversation. We also have differing political views and religious beliefs, like on the topic of abortion for example. He spends a lot of time on social media, whereas I prefer to limit my time on those platforms. Even sexually, we face challenges where he's not always able to satisfy me in the way I want, in a way where I’m desperately wanting to form intimacy and emotional connection. And then there are some days where he’d excite me sexually and tell me we’ll resume when we’re free but end up not following through his words. \nI am trying to be supportive of him, but with his tough family dynamic and upbringing and holding onto unhealthy behaviors, such as his past struggles with porn, it’s been really hard. He is medicating for it and for anxiety and depression as well which I know has its own set of challenges but we still had the same issues before he took those meds. I am only beginning to explore myself sexually for the first time now and I have so much hunger for it and so much more I want to experience but I can’t help but feel sad, selfish and impatient for having such thoughts. \nI am torn between giving the relationship more time and dealing with our challenges or ending it altogether and taking the easy way out. On some days, it feels great, but on many others, I get filled with negative thoughts and doubts. As my first relationship, I don't know if I will ever find someone who is as affectionate, loving and thoughtful as he is. Or if I will ever be able to care about someone as deeply as I do for him. \nI'm not sure what advice I'm seeking, but I would appreciate any guidance on how to navigate these complicated feelings and make the best decision for myself and our relationship. Thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\nTL;DR: Is love enough? I'm torn between staying with my loving boyfriend who I'm not sure I truly love, and leaving to explore my own desires. With our differences in personality, religion, politics, family dynamics, and sexual intimacy, can we make it work? As my first relationship, is it worth taking the risk to find someone who better aligns with me, or should I settle for what I have?",

        "text": "I've been talking and going out with my friend (M20) a lot recently. In the past 2 weeks, I've been gaining feelings him for many reasons. We've called twice where it ended up being all nighter calls, and we've hung out practically every other day.\n\nHe is one of the nicest people I know whom are very emotionally mature and have gentleman etiquette. That being said, whenever we go out, he always opens the car door for me and holds his hand on the roof to make sure I don't bump my head. Additionally, he always follows the sidewalk rule and whenever we are driving downhill or turning, he puts his arm in front of my body in case my body goes too forward. We've had many talks about relationships, where we want to be in the next few years, and I've found myself falling for him more and more. He's been confidenty flirty with me with making comments and his gestures, but because I have trust issues I couldn't help but be wary.\n\nYesterday, we grabbed dinner together and he said we should wear matching colors. We went to grab dinner, dessert, and then after he set up a movie night in his backseat by pulling the seats down. We drank a bit, and then proceeded to his place where we drunk more. At first, he played songs and invited me to dance, slow dancing to a few songs. Eventually, it got to a point where we got lost in each others eyes developing into a kiss. The kiss escalated into him bringing me to his bed, and him telling me all his running thoughts. How he's been falling in love with me, how I'm all hes been thinking about recently, all the sleepless nights and staying up to be with me, etc. We ended up having sex for a bit, and then he stopped himself saying we shouldnt do it. We both mutually confronted our feelings for each other, however he told me he was unsure about how to proceed. He was scared because he fucked up his last relationship pretty badly and that hes more worried about where he will be to support his family within the next few years.  Additionally, he's planning on transferring out and is unsure or not whether ldr is something he wants to try for. In the end, he told me that we should forget about this night, although realistically he wont be sble to. We ended up falling asleep after I told him I understood he needed time. \n\nNow I'm confused about what to do with my feelings. Do I try to hold onto them and hope that perhaps good will come out of it? Or do I try to talk to him this time both being sober and see whether anything can happen right now.\n\nTLDR: My friend and I have feelings for each other but he doesnt want a relationship right now.",

I haven’t accused her of doing anything secretive but I’ve tried to ask if she’s ok and if we’re ok and she just gets moody and says to stop asking.\n\nHere the kicker, the other night whilst sleeping, I thought I was dreaming as I could hear a woman lightly moaning. I instantly woke and sat there shocked for maybe 30 seconds and realised it was my girlfriend pleasuring herself next to me. I looked over and thought I could see her recording herself on Snapchat but could not be 100%\n\nI felt really faint but I got the courage to ask her what she was doing. She quickly closed her phone and said nothing, I think she assumed I didn’t hear her. I told her I heard her without trying to start a fight and she said she must of been doing it in her sleep.\n\nIt’s the next day and I don’t know what to do.\n\nDo I confront her about it or just leave it. \n\nTLDR: girlfriend pleasing herself next to me then lying has made me suspicious",

        "text": "I have been with my partner for a little over a year. I don't know how significant that is to most people, but for me and my partner, this was our longest relationship. I ended our relationship because I was tired of him always trying to take the easy way out of arguments. Every time he upset me, he would often try to make the problem seem small or act as if I worry too much about it. He hates confrontation and would put off difficult conversations as long as I could and would often try to do whatever he could to solve the problem quickly to avoid tension, even if he didn't really understand my feelings or the issue at hand. The final straw was me finding out he still had explicit photos of his ex-partner, and once again he tried to minimize the problem and say I worry too much.\n\nSo I broke up with him. Before I met him, I hadn't ever loved anyone I had dated. I met him and it was a slap in the face of \"your life is never going to be the same\" and we just clicked. I never had an immediate bond with someone before in my life, and from the second we met, we were impossible to find apart. We were best friends for a year before he confessed to me and we began to date. This is my first real relationship, but I'm doing fine despite it ending.\n\nI'm pretty emotional, but it's been a few weeks since the breakup and I have yet to cry. My friends all told me that I was probably processing things, and the sadness may come later. It hasn't happened yet, and my friends are getting confused. Truthfully, I'm confused too. I thought I would be crushed, have my heart in shambles like the movies, especially since the breakup was not clean at all. Sure, I have some discomfort every now and then, like when I have to adjust my day-to-day activities to accommodate his lack of presence, but it feels different than sadness. I've tried to focus on my feelings and think about my relationship to see if I feel anything, but I don't feel any heartache. My roommates believe that I'm keeping my guard up, but I think I would be able to tell if I was faking being okay.\n\nDeep down, I'm worried that means I wasn't as invested in my relationship as I thought I was. Perhaps I had mentally checked out of the relationship earlier? Has someone gone through a similar lackluster breakup?\n\n TL;DR! I broke up with my partner of a year and don't feel sad.",

        "text": "I found out that my new boyfriend(29M) has a Reddit account which he uses to subscribe to a local dirty Reddit channel where females post their exposed body and masturbate etc. Apparently he’s been using that channel to jack off ever since he was single, and he tells me that it’s just material for him to masturbate to and it’s just “fantasy”. When he was still single, he would message the dirty Reddit girls privately and for those who replied him, they would exchange dirty text. He’s been pretty frank about it to me  and hasn’t done all of these after he’s together with me. Yes, he does go on the Hub to watch porn and masturbate but if he wants to make it fast or when he’s lazy to look for videos, he uses that Reddit channel to masturbate. Is it me being too insecure? I’d like to know what he means by “fantasy”. When I (24F) watch porn, I would imagine the man is my boyfriend. But I wonder how it is for him and what he meant by fantasy. AFAI fantasy is something you desire but won’t/can’t happen or have a low chance of happening— it’s like how we’ve talked about how our fantasy is to try having sex in a changing room. I don’t mind my boyfriend watching porn as they’re production and the females are actresses, but seeing my boyfriend jack off while looking at exposed boobs and puss of local women makes me feel like I am never enough. I just don’t get why he has to fantasise… i can’t get into his head and know whether he’s fantasising having sex with them or what. It doesn’t help that the girls on local dirty Reddit have bigger boobs and better body than me. I’ve told him about my insecurities, he understands but he just assures me that he won’t cheat.\n\nTl;dr: My boyfriend jacks off to nude local girls playing with themselves and he says it’s just fantasy. But I don’t get why he has to fantasise about other local girls.",

        "text": "I have been rehashing this same argument over and over again and need to approach it in a different manner. We've been together for 8 years and we can't figure out how to deal with the division of household labor. I'm not super clean but there are certain things that need to be done around the house and I feel like it's always on me to initiate. He'll do things if I ask but I don't want to be his manager.\n\nI want to split the chores and so does he but it's not on the same level. When I asked him if he can do some chores before he starts playing video games, he asked me what I want done. That really rubbed me the wrong way because I don't want to mother him, he lives in the same condo and can see that the dishwasher needs to be unloaded or that the tool box needs to be moved from the middle of the dining area. I was wrong to say the above with an angry tone but I'm very fed up at this point. His reply was that he was fine with everything where it was...\n\nAn example of having to be a manager and mismatched expectations was when I had to lead the dishwasher installation last week. I expected to work on it together but he kept pushing me to figure things out on my own, asking what I wanted to do next or how I wanted to solve a problem rather than having a rapport. When I stopped to think about what the next step was, he would walk away and say \"let me know if you need any help\". I think it was an attempt to empower me but I made it clear that I wanted an equal partner. This is different than before when he was involved and would watch repair videos on his own initiative. \n\nA complicating factor is his ADHD. I try to be understanding but it's not an excuse or explanation for his actions. It explains why he can't bring himself to do chores unless absolutely necessary (eg laundry which he'll leave in the dryer for days) but I'm not going to do everything for him. I don't want to approach this solution with a chore chart because he saw one through a neighbor's window and expressed that it was ridiculous but we obviously need to have a conversation on solutions. Also, I know to do lists give him anxiety so a chore chart will not be well received. I am not optimistic that he'll do things like clean the bathroom or floors on time so I'm thinking the solution will need to be small tasks or spontaneous cleaning.\n\nTl;dr: how do we talk about chores as adults?",

Not really sure how the topic came up but we ended up discussing celebrities. He said Brad Pit was “hot” and I said that I thought Leo DiCaprio was “cute” and that Ruby Rose was also “hot”. Didn’t think this would be an issue but he got really silent afterwards. He then packed up his stuff to leave my apartment. Under the impression that he was going to stay the night, I was confused. After asking what was wrong he said “I don’t say other women are ‘cute’ out of respect, if you want someone ‘cute’ then go be with someone cute” and stormed off. In my head this was a harmless discussion on celebrities. I’m in love with him and despite finding some celebrities attractive it doesn’t mean I love him any less. I even told him that I wouldn’t care of he said a female was attractive. Atleast for me, finding someone attractive doesn’t necessarily mean you want to be with them over your partner. What can I do/say to reassure him that I’m not going to ditch him for some celebrity that I think is cute? \n\nTLDR: Boyfriend (30M) upset and stormed out after I (25F) said a male a celebrity was “cute”.

Don't get me wrong, it is enjoyable, but within the last few months I have noticed a significant decrease in the amount of time we have alone cuddling and such as well as the amount of times we have sex because of it. Usually when we are going to be hanging out alone at my apartment or whatever, she always wants to smoke and that pretty much puts her out of commission for the night with anything romantic or sexual and usually leads to her falling asleep about an hour later. And sometimes when we hang out with our group of friends, she hints at wanting to do romantic or sexual stuff alone after the hangout, but she always ends up popping an edible or something at some point during the night and getting way too high to even hang out with me.\n\nThis has kind of led to me being a little down in the dumps over the last few months and its been making me doubt if she even actually wants to do stuff sober with me anymore. I don't know if she sees me in that light anymore. It just makes me sad and I don't know what to do about it because I know if I bring up how I'm feeling about everything, she will more than likely get mad at me because it relates to something she really likes to do (weed) and she would probably take it as me just wanting more sex. I mean that is partially what the problem is, but like yeah, I don't know\n\nIf anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nTLDR: Whenever I want to have romantic or romantic time with my gf, she is always too high to even hang out with me.

He was in the service and I am currently in the service my SO is in the serice as well. He said the reason im a POS is due to what branch I was in wich led me to think it was a joke but he stopped responding after she defended me. I have noticed her siblings have acted strange around me as well. They seem to dislike me and take jabs. When we go out for dinner they ask me to buy them things even when I cover the tab for dinner. A little back story as well I am relatively successful and outspoken. My girlfriend has always been shy and timid and usually does whatever her family says in the exception of this case it seems seeing as she showed me. She was also living at home with her parents before moving in with me. Her mother has warned her about the age gap as well apprently even thought its not that bad. Her aunt and grandma seem to like me though. \n\nTl;dr: I might be reading to far into this but am I just being paranoid or is there something to this? Do you think he genuinely does not like me?

I guess subconsciously I always downplayed into it being a few incidents that were due to unrelated circumstances, and to me it always felt right to do these things because it was to help me cope with my own anxieties and loneliness from the long-distance part.\n\nToday, I realized I've been a textbook emotional manipulator for over a year to the person I love the most.\n\nI've spoken about all of this to them, they still love me (or at least claim to) and don't want to break up or even stop talking, they just want me to get professional help and work on being better. Which I can do, and I've already started trying to (I'm getting a psych eval soon). But I can't help but feel this huge amount of guilt, like I've turned something that was supposed to be happy for both of us into a nightmare where they can't even feel loved by me half the time. Even when I'm trying my best to do nothing but grow and change, I can't help but feel like continuing to be in this relationship at all is abusive because of what I am capable of doing.\n\nI guess my question is, for anyone who's been in this situation, realizing you were the one in the wrong, were you able to save the relationship, and if you did, what did you do to turn it around? How did you get over the guilt and just focus on making the future better?\n\n\\-\n\nTL;DR: i think ive been a huge emotional manipulator for a year and a half, even if somewhat unintentionally, im still in the same relationship and im trying to fix everything but id like advice on where to go from here",

        "text": "Please don't judge me.\nI (19f) met this guy from tinder he's in his late 30's (he is also a professor at the college I'm at). We had dinner and against my better judgement he had someone convinced me to come over and see his place. We drove to his place and had some drinks there, then he offers me some weed, I haven't done weed much before maybe around 2-3 times unsuccessfully. I'm coughing a lot every minute and drinking water barely helped. After that episode I finally feel high, and we're chatting on his couch and he's super close to me and starts kissing my neck and ears and telling me something along the lines of being really into me. I think he tried to make some advances but I remember telling myself I don't want to have sex since we just met. Fast forward a bit I go to the washroom in his room and when I come out he's on the bed with boxers on. I think I asked why he took off his clothes but I'm not sure because I'm really high &amp; drunk so I don't remember everything exactly. Then I sit on the bed and I tell him I don't really want to have sex since we just met and such. He's still touching me and kissing me, I think he convinces me to, but I'm still reluctant about it but he's taking my clothes off. I couldn't do much in my current state to stop this (I've never been this high :( ). But now I'm naked and he doesn't have a condom on so I say you have to have a condom, this is not me agreeing but honestly at that point I did not have the capacity to stop it anyways. I don't remember what he said but he didn't use a condom. He starts having sex with me and I'm completely turned away from him and he's gripping my body to stay close &amp; pulling my hair. It feels good because I'm high &amp; everything but I still didn't want it. Does that mean anything? I also think he may have came in me &amp; he had asked if I was in birth control. The day after he messages me about last night and sober me is really angry realizing what happened. I told him I didn't really want to see him again ( I don't like upsetting people 🙁) . I've been thinking about the incident since it happened last week. What do I do since I technically enjoyed it and didn't explicitly say no :/ I just feel my body betrayed me. I don't know how to get it off my mind.\n\nTL;DR: tinder date professor and my college got me really high and we had sex but I didn't want to, what do I do?",

        "text": "\nMy now ex (21M) and I (22F) of 2 years have recently broke up. I’m sad but I’m not devastated because I saw it coming. My ex is amazing but he has a hard time with his mental health, overthinking, insecure and such.We broke up because he says he wants to learn why he is the way he is and wants to better himself. He says he doesn’t want to lose me and wants me to wait for him, however I told him I couldn’t promise him that because it’s not fair to me. Who knows if he changes his mind and finds a girl on this “self exploration”. Granted I do think he’s telling the truth because he has not really had a full year of him just being single. After his first girlfriend a few months later we met and slowly progressed into a relationship.\n\nThat’s all to say we are currently in no contact. I don’t know what the future holds, but we put a down payment down to go on a cruise in August with his family. It’s not fully paid off yet but the rest is due in May. He has has to pay his half and I pay mine. Guys I really wanna go on this cruise LOL. The destinations on the cruise are so good for the price. Not to mention I am cool with his family and one of my close friends who actually introduced us will be on the cruise because her boyfriend is in the family. I know it’s not the best idea because old feelings might resurface and such and such. BUT I really think I can handle it. I don’t believe in getting back together but I will admit i’m not 1000% against it only after a year or two. Even if I really want to get back after the cruise I know it would not be a good idea. It is a room with a shared bed, but he is very respectful and once I express my boundaries he will respect it. \n\nI know there’s also the question on what if he gets a girl and if that’s the case then I will definitely back off the cruise. And I don’t plan on getting in another relationship for at least a year. What do you think.\n\nTL;DR: Opinions on going a cruise with an ex and his family.",

He's being very patient and everything but every time we get close it just feels... idk, wrong maybe?  I asked him out because I thought he was cute and he made me laugh and I assumed (hoped?) the rest would come later, but I'm just not attracted to him.  It's very clear that he's super committed to this relationship, and I really like him but I don't want to be in a relationship with him anymore.  I just feel like I'm dragging him on when I don't see a future in it or really enjoy it as it is and I feel awful.  I'm trying to find a way to break it off that can't be turned into \"we'll make it work\" and, more importantly, that's as painless for him as possible.  Obviously I've never done this before and I don't want to be like \"sorry but I'm not attracted to you\" because that would be absolutely awful so I need help because I have no idea what to do, I've run through like a hundred scenarios in my head and none of them end well\n\ntldr: I want my relationship to be over but don't want to hurt him and I need help",

I do enjoy sex but when it lasts a longgg while it does start to hurt. He's understanding but I think he's starting to think l'm using it as an excuse to stop whenever. Idk if l'm paranoid but i swear he gets all huffy and puffy when I want to stop (happened 4 times including last night in our 4 months for reference). That makes me think that he thinks I'm trying to make an excuse when I'm really not. I've spoken to him about this and he says he doesn't think that but idk i'm paranoid he does because of how I think he doesn't care and acts annoyed. \n\nLast night I told him it was hurting and wanted to stop because I didn't want to feel the uncomfort I sometimes get for the week after when my vagina gets irritated. Ive told him about this in the past and he acts understanding but tries things even when I told him I need to heal.\n\nBack to last night I offered oral instead but he wasn't into it and just said \"one more minute inside and I'll finish\"\nI was like ugh but it hurts but was like fine. It was painful but I wanted it to be over with so I did it.\n\nAfterwards I started thinking about it a lot and felt disrespected like he cares about his pleasure over how I feel. Like am I overreacting that I want to end things now just from that? It sucks because other than sex he's the most loving and sweet guy l've ever known.\nThank you for reading I'm just confused and not experienced in relationships if Im telling the truth.\n\nTL;DR : I feel like boyfriend either thinks i'm lying about pain or cares about his pleasure over my well being; makes me want to break up bc I have the ick now, am i overreacting bc he's amazing otherwise.",

We are on calls together for hours each day. If were around each other I notice she stands like a little too close, and I generally always have her attention...and last week we were in her office and we were not fighting but disagreeing about something and she was moaning and breathing heavily, to which I asked are you unwell? And in this moment I felt like she was going to jump over the desk and make out with me. Like the sexual tension was so intense, and nothing came of it. We're only in the office together once weekly.\n\nI'm pretty sure feelings are there for both of us. Do I just ask for a transfer or get another job? And the part where I'm clearly too deep in this, I would really hate to lose her from my life. I don't know her at all and I never really got into a work thing like this, any advice or thoughts?\n\nTL:DR My relationship with my boss is getting sexually tense, what do I do?",

        "text": "Alright, me and this woman used to work together, there was a lot of sexual tension but I was her supervisor, and she made a big pass at me. I reluctantly rejected her because it could've cost us both our jobs. We remained friends and never spoke about it but the tension remained. Like at one point she got my number and her hand was shaking as she got my number. She eventually got a serious boyfriend as did I and that seemed to be the end of it.\n\nShe left our line of work and moved to the other side of the country, about 2,000 miles away. Before she left I made her a playlist, probably closest I got to a confession of feelings towards her. I know to this day she still listens to it from time to time thanks to making it on spotify. We stayed in touch as casual friends but both of us eventually broke up with out significant others. Remained in touch via social media and while attraction was still there we never breached that topic.\n\nFast forward about 3 almost 4 years later and I'm in town for a work conference where she now lives and works. I sent her a message, we hadn't really spoken for a year so wasn't sure what to expect but within a few minutes of messaging her she replied enthusiastically she wanted to meet up. We meet up, things click instantly again like no time had passed at all. Vibes are good as we speak for about 3 hours. During that time she admits that she is single but that there is a guy she is casually seeing but emphasized that she has no romantic feelings towards him and doesn't want to be his girlfriend. She also admits she wants to move back to the city I live in.  \n\nThen I realize probably won't see her again in-person for a long time if I just wait for chance. So I tell her how I feel and that I've missed her have romantic feelings towards her. She seems a bit dumb struck by this, not offended by it. She is smiling about it but definitely was sort of a deer in headlights kind of moment. She admits that it felt instantly comfortable talking with me. I ask to make sure I am not embarrassing her and assures me I am not. I let her know I'm willing to come visit her if she wants my company/to date. She tells me that she's not looking for a long distance relationship right now, and that while not serious about man she's seeing she doesn't want to be unfair to him. I let her know I understand and am not trying to sabotage their relationship, just figured I should make my feelings clear. I take her to her car and then I go to mine. Funny enough later while getting set up in my rental car she drove past and stopped her car right behind my parking space. Thought she was about to get out and say something but suppose she decided against it and drove off.\n\nSo now I am wondering what to do. Forget about her? Play things by ear but not wait around? Did I overstep with my actions? And did I misread her conversational \"hints\" during our conversation? I felt her telling me she was functionally single and thinking of moving back to my area, as well as her asking about the area I lived in felt like hints but not sure. Maybe she wasn't expecting me to say anything? Any insight and advice about this would be appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*tl;dr\\*\\* Told a long term flame that I had feelings for her when reconnecting with her, and hoping how I went about it was respectful. And trying to figure out best efforts going forward.",

        "text": "As the title says, I can't be around my mother for more than 5 minutes. This comes from a pretty long history of issues, so this may be slightly lengthy. I'm happy to expand on what I can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are devoutly religious. My father (63M) at the very least is someone I can hold a conversation with without the fear of the convo going downhill, and even if it does, it lasts 5 seconds or ends in a joke and I can change the subject. My mother, on the other hand, will almost obsess about a specific topic- for instance, she'll introduce a topic, express her discontent, and aim the conversation towards my father, who will echo that discontent and prolong a conversation. This is usually surrounding a conspiracy theory of some sort and happens on a regular basis.\n\nMy five siblings (all 18-35) and I hold almost completely opposite views from our parents. We've all grown up surrounded by religion, but at some point in each of our teenage years have grown away from it. Our schooling experiences are all over the place because we were made to attend religious schools we didn't want to be in.\n\nMy mother has fallen further into the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories since the start of the pandemic and has actively been sending emails to us from dubiously-sourced news articles. My sister has even had to tell my mother to back off and threatened no contact, which stopped it... for a little bit. My mom has gone from previously just anti-covid-vax to completely anti-vax, and has taken it upon herself to push these views onto my brother, his wife (a doctor), and their newborn son. My teen years were rough, as I was stunted socially, going through a depression while being home-schooled, and discovering my identity, and my mother was... not very supportive.\n\nI should add that my mother's life as a kid wasn't very easy, as her parents divorced at some point in her childhood and her relationship with her father seemed messy.  I don't believe my mom would go to therapy. I don't know what happened in the past as she won't open up about it, but I don't think she really believes in therapy, as when I asked constantly for it in my teens, she put it off and said that all I needed was some time. My brother began to go to therapy but didn't trust the therapist that my mom chose, so she withdrew him from it and said that \"therapy doesn't work for everyone\". I think, because of her childhood, she has this defense mechanism to treat everything like its an attack on her. If you try to challenge her, she'll respond very defensively. It makes it extremely hard to try and discuss with her that she needs to change this behavior because she does take it personally.\n\nI recognize that this behavior is easy to just ignore, but it seems to make it worse. I'm very tired of having to deal with this every time I see her. I'd like to go home more and hang out with my younger brothers, but I avoid doing this while I know she's home. I feel bad that I dislike being around her- I want to spend more time with her and be happy doing it, because genuinely she's a sweet, kind, and good mother outside of that, but its like everything has to segue into something political or religious these days and frankly, I'm just exhausted and resentful.\n\nI'm sure there are bigger problems in the world to solve but I'm hoping someone has a similar problem with some solution... I have to go to my house this Friday to spend St. Patrick's Day with my parents and siblings and I'm sort of dreading it.\n\nI don't want to walk on eggshells anymore. I don't want every moment I spend with my mom to be turned sour just because of this. What can I do or say to make this more bearable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My mom turns conversations into a discussion of politics or conspiracy theories within 5 minutes of me being there and it ruins every visit I have to my home. I can feel my resent increasing and I just want a healthy relationship with my sweet, caring mom.",

        "text": "Married for one year. Together 6 years total female 26; male 28. Personality issues/changes\n\n Idk how to post on Reddit but Idk if I’m being abused mentally and financially I do not work atm I am currently studying to pass an licensing exam. Noticed things start to change when we got married and he got this well paying job. We’ve been together for 6 years one year married. I feel like I can’t speak my mind and defend myself anymore it feels like I’m being manipulated. Certain things he says to me or argues to me about. I feel powerless just bc I don’t have any income I think he thinks he can control my life. He asks why I need money when I ask for money, he thinks he’s entitled to my car because we’re married and his car is a pos and he pays for all the gas in my car. He doesn’t want to put my name on the house he is buying because I don’t make any income. I feel like a burden, like he’s so ready for me to get off his dime. keep in mind when he had nothing and no money I had to work two jobs and go to school to help him pay all of his bills and rent that’s also including all of my bills I had to pay. I stopped asking him for money to help pay my bills. I had to start asking my own father to help me. :/ I hate confrontation with him bc he’ll end up screaming at me and twisting my words around. I just don’t know how to tackle this. I want control of my life back idk if he even thinks he’s doing anything wrong or does he know what he’s doing which is way worse imo Idk I feel like I’m going crazy \n\nTLDR: I think my husband has clinically NPD and he’s possibly being manipulative idk how to move forward and communicate without calling him out and upsetting him.",
