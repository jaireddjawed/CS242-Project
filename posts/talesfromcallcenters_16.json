        "text": "I work for a grocery chain in the US. I deal with problems with our in-house products, customer comments, and general food questions. These are some of the calls/emails I've had in the last couple of weeks. I will try and give any follow up to the ones I know about.\n\n*  Customer asked if our cat litter (which uses grass seed) was GMO free. No idea. So I shook my head and escalated for research.\n\n* The oil that the customer was using to cook with won't \"make grease\". Customer could not elaborate.\n\n* Customer called in because her daughter had a reaction to something she ate. Her daughter has Celiac's and the customer wanted to know if something she ate had gluten in it. Not an unusual request, but there was a slight problem. Customer didn't know what the daughter ate because a friend was taking care of her and the customer wanted me to look at the friends grocery purchases for the last two weeks and tell her what had gluten in it. I suggested that the customer contact the friend and find out what her daughter ate.\n\n* Customer called in wanting to know why the serving suggestion of a *supplement* was different on a bottle than it was in his MyFitnessPal App. 20 minutes later, the customer kind of understood the app was wrong.\n\n* Customer wanted us to \"do something\" about the price of something we don't sell.\n\n* Customer wanted to know if spring water was safe to drink. Like drinking water.\n\n* The paper we use for our coupon flyers was to thick.\n\n* We do your fresh green beans stay green after cooking? Do you dye them?\n\n* Customer wanted to know about the enzymes used in our cheeses. Enzymes, or rennet, come from two sources; animal and microbial. Most people ask due to religious or dietary reasons. Customer emailed about more than 30 different products, many without previous research. \n\n* Due to a new Netflix documentary, customers are asking if our olive oil is real olive oil.\n\n* My company offers curbside pickup of your groceries. You make the order online, pick a time and date to pick up, and pick up your order. The time for pick up is in hour chunks. If you schedule a pick up between 13 and 14 hundred hours (1-2 PM) that means you can show up in that time and pick up. Being cold and flu season, many stores are running short staffed, especially for a job that requires lots of outdoor activity in winter temps. Customer emailed us that it was unfair that his wife had to wait for half an hour to get her groceries (wife arrived at 13:15, the email arrived at 13:45-ish) and that the store said that they were short-handed and that's not their problem.\n\n* Customer complained that the \"quality control of this generation is going downhill\" (direct quote) and that she hopes \"Mr. Trump\" will do something about it. All because roughly a handful of cans of mixed nuts that she had purchased in the last 5 years had a *slight* chemical smell. Customer also wanted to send us her nuts so we could know exactly what she was talking about. She could not understand that we keep samples of every production run we make of a product.\n\n* The directions on this bag of rice call for quarts of water and not cups. I'm never buying it again.\n\n* Quality issue with a product and Trump is going to fix it.\n\n* Women are hysterical and will throw food out even if it isn't bad. Can I eat this thing that is 4 years past the use by date? It's been in my fridge the whole time. (All said by a man.)\n\n##WINNER OF THE WEEK\n\n* A national recall was issued for a product that we make. The same product was also discontinued. The customer was convinced that it was a conspiracy to get him to stop buying our products. The customer refused to return the product to the store in spite of warnings about bacteria in the product.  Wanted to know if we were going to replace the product with something else. This went on for **30 minutes**. He too also claimed that Trump was going to do something about our \"swamp water company\". He finally asked to speak to someone else. I got him over to our escalation specialist, who was on the phone with him for another 30 minutes. He was not refunded and refused to go back to the store.\n\n**Side Note** -- The 3 Trump calls and the misogynist came in the same day.",

If they are swearing directly at me they will be immediately disconnected with no warning.\n\nThe following happened today and got my blood pumping, so I thought I would share it.    \nAllow me to introduce today's players:\n\nMe: Your's truly    \nAC: Angry customer    \nACM: Angry customer's mom\n\nMe: Thank you for calling XYZ, how may I direct your call?    \nAC: I NEED TO TALK TO A MANAGER, AND I NEED TO TALK TO ONE RIGHT FUCKING NOW!    \nME: *Hangs up*   \nAC immediately calls back (unfortunately our caller IDs suck and I could not tell if it was her again, but I was 90% certain it was)    \nMe: Thank you for calling XYZ, how may I direct your call?    \nAC: DID YOU JUST HANG UP ON ME?!    \nMe: Yes I did. You swore at me, and I do not let people treat me like that.    \nAC: WELL YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF!    \nMe: *Hangs up*    \nA few seconds later I get a call from a different number that turns out to be ACM, AC can still be heard yelling and swearing in the background    \nMe: Thank you for calling XYZ, how may I direct your call?     \nACM: Yes, we are having an issue with getting our plates and we need to talk to someone right away, please.    \nMe: Hmmm... Unfortunately the people who handle that are off today and won't be in until Monday. But, a sales manager should be able to help in the meanwhile, so let me get you over to one. *transfers call*\n\nSee how much further you can get by being polite and respectful?

We take care of all the German speaking countries in Europe, which besides Germany also means Austria, Switzerland and a little bit of Belgium.\n \n \n \nOne day this guy calls in and right of the bat he hits me with a curveball, filled with xenophobia. He had the call with me on speaker, so that his wife could listen in.\n \n \n \nM will be yours truly, C will be the Customer and CW will be Customer's Wife.\n \n \n \nM: \"Hello and welcome to Example Company Customer Service! My name is 5putnik! How may I assist you today?\"\n \n \nC: \"Yeah hi, I would like to have a refund for a few purchases I do not remember making!\"\n \n \nM: \"Oh I am sorry to hear that. Before we start may I have your credentials and authenticate you?\"\n \n \n \n(So here I take the credentials like his E-Mail address associated with his customer account, and then do the normal authentication in order to prove that the customer is the owner of the said account.)\n \n \n \nM: \"Alrighty! Thank you very much sir. So which purchases are the ones you do not recognize?\"\n \n \nC: \"Yeah, the ones from the last three days.\"\n \n \nCW: *(faintly in the background)* \"Can't believe those filthy f*cks did that...\"\n \n \n \nI decided to pretend to ignore that at first, since I did not know what she meant by that. It turns out those said charges are In-App purchases for a Gambling App. It weren't his first purchases either. As I looked further and further into the past of the purchase history, this guy spent in the matter of not even a year, almost 3,000 Euros for this App. Also, before he even used mentioned App, he also has spent 4-digit numbers on other Gambling Apps.\n \n \n \nM: \"Ok so you would like to refund the past 3 days. Do you know who might have made those purchases? Relatives, friends, etc?\"\n(Standard question for unrecognized charges)\n \n \nC: \"Yeah! Those filthy Refugees next door. They hacked into my Phone and made those purchases! Since they moved in last month, alot of weird things have happened around here.\"\n \n \nCW: \"Tell him about the time where they broke in the house and stole our TV!\"\n \n \n \nSo this guy goes on a huge rant, about how those Refugees living next door to him \"broke inside his house and stole their TV\" and how the crime has been increasing in their neighborhood.\n \n \n \nC: \"I'm telling you man! Those a-holes made those purchases! They may look dumb, but they only pretend to be dumb so that they don't have to work and live off of wellfare which we pay from our taxes! My wife thought I made those purchases! But it definetly wasn't me!\"\n \n \n \nAt this point something in my mind clicked. I totally exploded since I knew this guy was lying out of his as-. I mean forget his opinion about Refugees, have whatever stance on that you like. But lying into my face like that and trying to save your own pathetic, gambling addicted as- in this way was just too much for me on that day.\n \n \n \nM: \"Ok sir, in this case then I am going to have to deny your refund request then.\"\n \n \nCW: \"What?! Why?!\"\n \n \nC: \"WHY? ARE YOU F*CKING KIDDING ME?\"\n \n \nM: \"No, I'm not kidding. As far as I can see in your order history, you made purchases worth 3000 Euros in the past year alone for this App. Before you used this App you have used other Apps which were solely for Gambling, where you also spent 4-digit numbers in purchases. Furthermore \"hacking\" into one of our customers accounts is nearly impossible. As far as I can see from your Log-In history, your account has only been logged into devices which are known and associated with said account, since its creation.\"\n \n \nCW: (screaming violently loud) \"SO IT WAS YOU! YOU F-CKING LIAR! FIRST YOU WASTE ALL OF YOUR MONEY ON IT, THEN YOU CLEAR OUT MY BANK ACCOUNT FOR IT, YOU PIECE OF SH-T?!?!?! I SWEAR TO GOD---\"\n \n \n \n*click*",

I will look into this right away and get this resolved as quickly as I can for you.\n\nC: You better get my new phone here today! This is ridiculous, you always manage to f*** up.\n\nM: I want to change that experience for you today as I understand how disappointed you must feel, not to mention angry. Just to confirm, the phone you should have received was an iPhone 7+?\n\nC: Yes but the box is empty! Get me another one now!\n\nM: Absolutely, thank you for confirming. I will place you on a short hold while i speak to our dispatchers and get this reported and investigated.\n\nC: You can do that later, when will my new phone arrive?\n\nM: Once I have reported this correctly I can confirm all of that for you.\n\n(Customer is annoyed and inpatient. This is usually a red flag)\n\n**I check the IMEI (a unique code every mobile device) of the phone we sent and as per security we check to see if it has been used.\n**I then double check with the delivery company that they delivered to the correct address, who signed for it and sometimes a description of the person etc.\n\n**Low and behold the iPhone 7+ we sent is being used. **\n\nM: Thanks for holding. I am in the middle of logging this report so we can get the ball rolling for you and I just need a few more details.\n\nC: The box came empty, what else do you need to know?\n\nM: Was it yourself that received the box direct from the delivery driver?\n\nC: What is that got to do with it?\n\nM: When we report these missing phones internally we need all the facts as the boxes are sealed by the manufacturer until you open it. We need to figure out what has happened.\n\nC: Yea I got it from the driver, and now I think about it the seal of the box was broken. So either one of you guys or the driver took it. Either way I want another one today. \n\nM: Ok thank you for confirming. While doing some checks I can see the phone is being used by another number. I am very thorough when  it comes to theft so I checked to see if it was a registered number and it does appear to be one registered to you. Is there anyone else who could have opened the box and started using it?\n\nC: No way! Are you calling me a liar!? I opened it straight away so that is not possible.\n\nM: I am just confirming all facts before we continue. It does look as though you are calling from the same number right now. The system also confirms that the phone we delivered today is the one this SIM card is in right now.\n\nC: I'm telling you I don't have it. Send me another phone or cancel my contract.\n\nM: As it confirms on all of our systems that we have delivered the phone you ordered, which you are now using I am afraid we cannot send another phone nor cancel the contract as you have just upgraded for another 2 years. The only way to cancel would be to return the phone. \n\nC: I did sit the box down for for an hour or so, maybe it was stolen so you still better replace the phone. \n\nM: Sorry just to confirm, was the security seal broken before or after you left the box unattended?\n\nC: I can't remember.\n\nM: Did the box seem heavy enough to make it seem like the phone was in when you took it from the driver?\n\nC: What is with all these questions! Just send me a new phone or I will report you and your sh**ty company!\n\nM: Ok, for security I will blacklist the device now but if it was stolen from the box after it was delivered you could only get a replacement through an insurance policy, which I see you do not have through us direct.\n\nC: You are a joke!\n\n**Line gets cut off. Not sure if they hung up or it was the blacklisting of the device since he was using the 'missing' device to call me on.\n\nI genuinely don't understand how people think they can scam companies like that. They didn't even have the common sense to give up when I explained I could see they were calling from the phone they 'didn't'  receive. This happened fairly regularly haha.\n\nTL:DR Person orders new phone as part of an upgrade on their contract but claims the box was empty when it arrived. He called from the phone he claimed not to have received so I knew he was lying!\n",

This particular persons order was canceled because they filed a chargeback/dispute against us 3 years ago for fraud (no fraud was committed the address and paypal ID remained  the same from previous orders) and typically customers aren’t  allowed to order until we had the chargeback paid off or resolved. This one being 3 years old had very little info and follow up and few notes in the account. So I offered to put the customer on hold so they could talk to a chargeback specialist to fix this. I finally got someone on the line and she hung up. Now I go above and beyond because I am paid more than what my job entitles so I don’t mind going the extra mile. So despite the call dropping I went forward and spoke to 3 people who helped me come up with a solution so this customer can continue to order. This took me 30 minutes. By the time I was ready to call them back I was 15 minutes past my break time and ready to let them know all the hard work I put in for them despite them hanging up on me. When I called them back and attempted to confirm their name they told me I have the wrong number and hung up on me. I will not only get written up for spending so much time on a call but also written up for taking my break late. All my supervisor told me after the whole ordeal was that I am not customer service and I should have just taken my break and let it go. \n\nLong story short : went above and beyond to help a customer just for them to hang up on me twice  \n",

Check it out, it's a lot of shenanigans) when I thought of this call.  \n**Background:** I work for Canadian telecommunications giant **\"Blue\"** as a L2 cellular services technical agent. As we are open 24 hours a day, all sorts of calls get routed to us, due to the \"I don't know who I need!\" syndrome.  \n**Cast:  \n$Victim**: the customer calling in (nice lady)  \n**$Me**: yours truly, rugged of face, heroic of stature, flatulent of buttocks  \n\n\n**&lt;BEEP&gt;**  \n&gt;**$Me**: Thank you for calling Technical Support. How can I help you?  \n&gt;**$Victim**: I had a SIM card sent to me, but somebody stole it from my mail box!  \n&gt;**$Me**: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's get this sorted.  \n\n&lt;verification ensues&gt;  \nTo expand, this SIM had been sent as active, so it was a new line of service.\n&gt;**$Me**: So I do see the phone number as active, and there is a device connecting to the network.  \n&gt;**$Victim**: Can you block the number? I don't want all my minutes used!  \n&gt;**$Me**: Absolutely. &lt;block&gt; Done.    \n\n&lt;Ding! Lightbulb&gt;  \n&gt;**$Me**: For missing devices, we can also add the phone itself to the blacklist, so it cannot be used with any cellular number or provider in Canada. Would you like this done as well?    \n&gt;**$Victim**: But i didn't lose a phone, only the SIM ... &lt;lightbulb&gt; ...  \n\nI could almost hear the customer's understanding dawn.  \n&gt;**$Victim**: ... I mean, yes, I would like to report the device as missing as well.  \n&gt;**$Me**: OK.  \n\n&lt;Type-a, type-a type&gt;   \n&gt;**$Me**: Alrighty then. So the phone itself has been blacklisted under your phone number, so standard policy is that only yourself or the other authorized user on your account can request removal from the blacklist.    \n&gt;**$Victim**: Thank you so much!    \n&gt;**$Me**: You're welcome.  \n\n\n**TL;DR:** Seriously??

Can you please repeat it again slower so I can get you pulled up today? \n\nN- my phone has been hacked! I don't want them getting my social security number! If they get it, I'm going to sue your company!!\n\nM-... \n\nM- I definitely understand your concern but unfortunately I do need your social in order to help you today. \n\nN- (exasperated sigh) fine, it's 1...1...2...(Etc) \n\nM- thank you so much for that :) now you stated you wanted to fix (generic issue) and i have done that now. Is there anything else I can do for you? \n\nN- yeah now that you mentioned it...\n\n\n\nThis guy starts going off about how they kicked my bank out of their little town because a while back we refused to refinance the homes in the town when our bank bought the one previously there. I checked when his account was created and yup, right after the housing crash of 2008. He never throughout the call specified who \"they\" are so I like to imagine the they who kicked my bank out is the same they that hacked his phone. \n\n\nBut the part that really got me is as follows : \n\n\nN- (taxes taxes big government complaining blah blah) but you know what the worst part is? It's that IRS. I'm telling you they are all crooks... Lemme tell you something... (His voice gets quiet and low) the IRS all went down to the Bahamas a few years back. Big company retreat, everyone was invited. And you know what they did with your tax dollars? (Voice is barely a whisper now) they had an orgy. A sex orgy. \n\n\nAt this point he continues to ramble and rave and I put him on mute and lose my shit. I haven't laughed so hard in months. \n\nIt was still 10 minutes before he finally hung up, but he will always have a special place in my heart as my first nutcase. ",

        "text": "I'm finally ready to share my most traumatic call and I'm hoping it will help me sort of cleanse it from my psyche. \n\nI worked for a major international retailer and handled a variety of functions relating to cardholder accounts as well as online orders.  It was my first week on the floor and was still acclimating to CC life. So I get a call from one of our off-shore reps and can tell right off the bat something is wrong. Please note that her accent was MINIMAL but there's occasionally those customers who lose their minds over the thought of \"foreigners\" handling their order.\n\nShe gives me the pertinent information related to the order and informs me he's requested a US based rep. No big deal so far. I apologize to her and she sounded like she was about to cry. Red flag. I will be me and we'll call this fellow POS.\n\nMe:  Thank for calling Big Retailer, this is raging alpaca. May I have your first and last name?\n\nPOS: (Screaming) WHERE ARE YOU FROM?\n\nMe: (A little shaken) I'm based out of US, sir. \n\nPOS: I SAID WHERE? \n\nMe: Our center is based out of Arizona, sir.\n\nPOS: I DON'T WANT THOSE DAMN EXPLETIVES HANDLING MY ORDERS! ARE YOU AMERICAN?\n\nI'm a little stunned and exasperated because I A) have no accent and B) have already assured him of such, as much as I hated to.\n\nHe then calms SIGNIFICANTLY but remains really edgy throughout. I go through the verification steps, see that the order was cancelled due to his failure to verify the order. Unfortunately, I was unable to replace it for him because he was using Paypal and their security setup wouldn't allow us to. It wasn't a large order, maybe around $100 in men's clothing but all the items were still in stock.\n \nMe: I'm sorry, Mr. POS, I'm unfortunately unable to replace this order due to Paypal's security proto-\n\nPOS: WHAT? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T REPLACE IT? ARE YOU THAT FUCKING DUMB, RAGING ALPACA? HUH?!\n\nMe: (shocked) I'm so sorry, sir. I would like to send you a promotional code for the inconvenience if you would still like-\n\nPOS: YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE? I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE A LARGE OBJECT AND FUCKING SLAM INTO YOUR HEAD! JUST SLAM INTO YOUR HEAD UNTIL YOUR USELESS BRAINS COME OUT!\n\nI was starting to cry at this point and was incredibly embarrassed. I was in shock and still new and no one, before or since, has spoken to me like that. Why didn't I just disconnect, as others do when the call becomes abusive? Because this particular company has a policy of termination if you disconnect on a customer, any customer regardless of what they say.\n\nMe: Sir, I can longer assist you further if you keep speaking to me using such language.\n\nPOS: YOU WORTHLESS WHORE. WHY DON'T YOU LET 12 GUYS FUCK YOU IN THE ASS AT THE SAME TIME. HUH?! I BET YOU'D LIKE THAT! YEAH! 12 GUYS FUCK YOU IN THE ASS AND LET THE JIZZ RUN OUT!\n\nI can't hide the fact I'm crying anymore and people are staring. One of the specialists comes over and I hit the mute button like a kung fu master.  I explain the situation and they advise I attempt the \"broken record\" routine. I do this until I reach my end point and practically hyperventilating. I cut him off and put him on hold.\n\nThe call should have escalated to a specialist but they point blank refused it and sent me to the next in command. I blubber my way thru an explanation, she puts me on hold and speaks to a manager. This is a big deal at that center. She comes back and resignedly takes the call. I logged off that phone as soon as the call ended. \n\nI actually managed to stay there for a year before I'd had enough.  I actually became a specialist before I noped the heck out. Sorry for the length but I had to share this as a therapy of sorts. I realize no job is worth that and I'm trying to finish my degree this year.  I hope Mr. Twelve, as he came to be known, gets help because I'm pretty sure homie will cut someone without treatment.\n \nEdit: Typos\n",

I got this call today from an old military guy and you can definitely tell from his tone that he means business. Not rude but not friendly, either. \n\nSo we just discussed his entire policy that I stressed out my throat to the point that I'm wheezing and needs to place him on hold just so I can breathe well. I'm starting to get teary eyed and lose focus due to the throat pain plus coughing fits that really puts stress on my lungs. \n\nI guess this dude somewhat picked up on what's happening because he suddenly wrapped up the call and told me to just send a copy of his original contract and the number of a local rep so he can meet someone face to face. \n\nHere's how he ended the call:\n\nMe: Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nHim: Yeah. Just one more thing. //pauses. Please take care of yourself and avoid getting sick. You're such a nice young lady taking care of old geezers like me but don't forget yourself. Happy new year dear.\n\nI was so touched that I can barely let out a reply. I'm hoping he'll live for a lot longer. :)",

I'm doing this for therapeutic reasons, because this job will put me in a nut house, heh.\n\nSo a little bit about my job. I work as a customer care agent in the biggest carrier provider in my country. The company provides mobile services as well as internet, tv and phone services. I'm in a department where I have to sell people stuff, fix their problems, help them with bills, etc. Pretty much as exhausting and disgusting as it gets. These are just a few short stories I wanted to share.\n\nThe **\"I want you to fix my technical isuse right this second\"** type of customer\n\n**Me**: Hello, how can I help you?\n\n**C**: Hello, I'm calling because my landline phone and internet aren't working.\n\n**Me**: Okay, can you please tell me the phone number in question?\n\n**C**: *tells me the number*\n\n**Me**: Thank you. I see you already reported the issue yesterday. I also see the issue affects a number of customers, which means the problem is with the underground cable, but our technical support is on it. Unfortunately, I don't have the ETA yet.\n\n**C**: ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME?! WE HAVEN'T HAD THE INTERNET NOR TELEPHONE FOR 24 HOURS!! MY CHILD IS SICK AND I CAN'T EVEN CALL THE DOCTOR!! YOU'RE A HORRIBLE AND INCOMPETENT COMPANY!! I WANT TO CANCEL MY CONTRACT RIGHT NOW!!\n\nI was kinda surprised and I honestly had a hard time not hitting my head against the desk and telling her what a stupid asshole she is. Yes, your telephone doesn't work at the moment, but you're calling me from your mobile phone and claiming that you can't call the doctor because your landline doesn't work? I wish I could have pointed that out, but I'm not allowed to make \"cheeky\" remarks. It hurt my soul knowing she most likely gave me the worst possible rating after the call because she her issue wasn't fixed right there and then.\n\nThe **\"I don't want to change anything, but I demand cheaper service\"** type of customer\n\n**Me**: Hello, how can I help you?\n\n**C**: My bills are too high, I almost had a heart attack when I saw them! Shame on you, you're nothing but thieves!\n\n**Me**: Ma'am, I see that you have made a lot of international calls. Your bill is two times higher due to that.\n\n**C**: But I have (insert name) tariff!!! Why are my bills so high?? I'm a poor old lady!! Shame on you!\n\n**Me**: Ma'am, international calls are not a part of your tariff. I can offer you to take (insert name) option for (very cheap). Your bills would be cut in half.\n\n**C**: Fix my bills!! Why are they so high?? I'm not paying you this!! You put me on contract without my permission!!\n\nMe: Ma'am, nobody can put you on contract without your permission.\n\nC: You're not listening to me!! You thieves!! I'm leaving your company!!\n\nI thanked her for the call and transferred her to the retention department. I don't understand these kind of people. What goes through their minds? Are they calling just to argue? Do they not want me to help them? What's the deal? I just can't wrap my head around it.\n\nThere are so many different stories, ranging from people who claim their landline phone was \"hacked\" and the \"hacker\" made all those expensive calls, then those who have a monologe for 10 minutes and then just hang up, then the txpe that will try to use us as free phone sex service, then those who will legitimately be angry with me because they waited for a long time in queue. But I especially like those that seem nice and civil and then when they start hanging up call me a bitch or spew other offensive words, thinking I can't hear them.\n\nAlso, shoutout to the guys who don't pay their bills for months and then call in utter rage because we didn't reactivate their services right that second when they paid the bills. Hey douchebag, the payment needs to be processed by the bank(s) first and that takes up to a day, so maybe next time pay your bills in time? I know, sounds crazy, right? \n\nI have the utmost respect for people who work for years and years in CC. I don't know how those guys don't just lose it and kill everyone.\n\n\nEdit: a word. Also, sorry for longish rant.",

I dont remember where the call went from there, but, i wanted to say(and couldnt) that you need to have an emergency plan for yourself, it is not the bank’s job to bail you out. \n\nYou would be surprised the number of people that call us asking to advance their payroll in 2 weeks or a month. \n\nA lot of people threaten to sue for allowing them to overdraft and a lot of people threaten to sue because we wont let them overdraft. \n\nI also take a lot of calls from people disputing their balances.  Had a girl call in saying she never got her payment from PayPal. I tell her, yes you did, but your account was negative, so the credit was taken by that. Customer refuses to believe me.

I do the breakdown with the mother (mother was surprisingly nice), mother understands, daughter is still in the background screaming. Mother turns to the daughter and starts to scold her for wasting my time and harassing me. She tells her to stop acting like a child and that she needs to learn how to manager her account. My jaw drops. I start to giggle. Mother giggles with me as daughter continues to scream in the background. Mother says she will take care of it and lets me go. \n\nIve had a lot of people wish black magic on me. A lot of people telling me that they hope my children die.

I can You my Employee ID number.\n\nCustomer- I don’t want it I want to know how you got this number.\n\nMe- You provided this number to DTV as a way for us to get in contact with you. \n\nCustomer-  Oh.(audible pause) Well then what’s my Address?\n\nMe- (Address)\n\nCustomer- You could have gotten that anywhere.\n\nMe- No Ma’am, if you want, I can tell you your account Number to verify.\n\nCustomer- Okay.\n\nMe-(account Number)\n\nCustomer- That’s the right number but I don’t want it. Can I get transferred to your billing department?\n\nMe- Unfortunately as I am part of the Promotion s team I don’t have access to the internal numbers required to do so you would have to call our 1-800 number to do so.\n\nCustomer- Oh your just lazy and A terrible sales men. I am going to report this call for poor service(hangs up).\n\n",

        "text": "I work customer service for an airline. Bereavement calls are the worst. I can't help but empathize with people and sometimes it's really sad to hear. They have that shaky, shell shocked voice, or you can hear their throat getting choked up as they try to speak as they say the words that their beloved one is dead and they need a flight (or cancel a trip for the deceased) and sometimes there's just the sobbing and the gasping or sometimes silent crying where you don't hear much except their gasp for air and sometimes it takes them a moment to even say anything at all.\n\nI try to be really helpful with these calls and if they can't talk at the beginning of the call, I say something so they know I'm not going to hang up before they get the chance to force out words like, \"Hey, I'm here for you, take your time. I'm going to do my best to help you as soon as you're ready.\" They're usually very grateful and I try to help as quickly as possible so they can get off the phone and deal, cry, or get to other things they now have to do. \n\nBut sometimes bereavement really brings out the worst in people. This is one of those stories.\n\nI get a call and start with my usual spiel:\n\nMe: Thank you for calling [airline], may I start with your confirmation code please?\n\nC (yelling): MY FATHER DIED! How's _that_ for a confirmation code?!! I have some QUESTIONS!\n\nMe, (genuinely feeling bad for her and knowing grieving people aren't always rational I don't take offense at the yelling or snarky tone though I *am* baffled by how quickly I seem to have offended her with just my opening line):\nI'm very sorry to hear that ma'am. I can answer your questions without a confirmation code, what can I help you with?\n\nC loses her mind: I DON'T _HAVE_ QUESTIONS ABOUT A CONFIRMATION CODE!!!! MY FATHER DIED! I'M TRYING TO GET SOME HELP HERE!\n\nOkay, she totally misunderstood what I said but still trying to help her out,\n\nMe: I'm sorry, what I meant was-\n\nC: Can I speak with a supervisor?!! I wanna speak with a supervisor!! MY FATHER DIED!\n\nNow, I'm supposed to do all I can for a customer before transferring to a supervisor, and if I do still need to, I'm supposed to have as much info as I can for them ready, at the very least, know what the problem is, but this lady still hasn't asked her questions. So I try one more time,\n\nMe: I can help you ma'am, what's your que-\n\nC: I SAID I WANTED TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR! I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS! WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO ME? MY FATHER DIED!!\n\nAt this point it's obvious there's no saving this so I'm going to transfer her:\n\nMe: I can transfer you to a supervisor ma'am-\n\nC: MY FATHER DIED!!! I'M TRYING TO GET SOME HELP HERE! I WANNA SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR, IS THAT _OKAY_ WITH YOU!? \n\nEven at this point with her yelling the entire time I'm still shocked at how derisive and condescending she is with her tone in asking \"is that *_okay_* with you?\" I've already told her I can transfer her but she's misunderstood again so I try to politely release the call and tell her I'm transferring her. She's started ranting now so I try to speak over her to tell her she's getting a supervisor because I don't see the point in sitting there getting yelled at until she runs out of breath first.\n\nMe: -Ma'am, I'm transferring you n-\n\nC: STOP INTERRUPTING ME! WHY ARE YOU INTERRUPTING ME? I NEED HEEEEELLPP! MY FA-\n\nMe: * puts her on hold while I get a supervisor.\n\nI've never lost my father and I'll be devasted when I do but I sure hope I don't try so hard to misunderstand and yell at people who could help me...",

Due to the storms in the NE we had quite a few cancellations.\n\nWe've all been there before and it's really frustrating not to know what's happening, I get it. But holding up the line complaining about the hold time or asking questions no one knows the answer to (and even if I did it doesn't help your situation _now_) or demanding compensation you're not entitled to doesn't get you anywhere and just makes other people calling in to reschedule or get refunds wait on hold that much longer.\n\nOne (understandably frustrated) customer just started yelling about how everything is our fault and we have terrible customer service and we should have given more notice about a last minute cancellation, etc and finally ended with, \"...and you just cancelled my flight _on purpose_ for NO REASON...!\"\n\nYes, ma'am. We cancelled your flight for no reason because we are a company that hates money and likes giving it back in refunds, requiring overtime for call center staff at time and a half pay, not to mention having crew and pilots stuck in airports and unable to staff other flights that day, requiring more staff to reconfigure our inventory of planes and personnel to different routes as soon as possible keeping track of legal hours worked before they hit their maximum legal work time necessitating mandatory wait times, and sometimes accommodations and feeding them until they can legally get back in the air.\n\nI'm just glad I'm not a gate agent. I couldn't hack it that's for sure.",

        "text": "Back with another tale from roadside assistance. This was the most memorable interaction I have ever had with a customer, anywhere. I will be me, AF will be aspiring felon, SP will be the service provider's office dispatch, and CM will be our call manager.\n\n\nIt was a dreary afternoon in our dungeon (I sat in the basement of the CC), where a bright and innocent young advocate sat dreaming of the outside world.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen I hear it. The dreaded prompt. \"New ERS Service Request.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Me: Good afternoon, this is me. May I begin by verifying that you're in a safe place?\n\n\n&gt;AF: Yes, honey, but I have a huge problem. You're driver is being soooo disrespectful and unhelpful. He's refusing to tow our car when a jump didn't work! How are you going to fix this?\n\n\n&gt;Me: OK, well I apolo-\n\n\n&gt;AF: He's also being very racist and shouting at my husband and I! (Someone is always racist *eyeroll*)\n\n\n&gt;Me: Oh, well, I am very sorry! May I get your membership number so I can take a look at your service request?\n\n\n&gt;AF: Yes, it's {number}\n\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you! So now - (proceeds to verify some information and double verify the story that the member had told me while notating everything)\n\n\n&gt;AF: I really need to get this car out of here, sir. I hope this all works out.\n\n\n&gt;Me: As do I. Let me get you on a quick hold to call the service provider to see what's going on on their end (we always did this because members were lying 99% of the time)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, for a little background info, this service provider was from around the metro Detroit area. These members were located in Saginaw. He had driven that far out of his way to help them try to start their car. Props to this driver.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;SP: {Tow company}, this is Billy.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Hi Billy, this is me from {roadside assistance company}, had a few questions about a service call. It's {service request number}.\n\n\n&gt;SP: I'm guessing it's the one in Saginaw? (Never a good sign when they know offhand!)\n\n\n&gt;Me: Correct, the customer said the driver was refusing a tow?\n\n\n&gt;SP: Yes. That lady is fucking crazy. Our driver is way out of area to help, and we DO NOT do tows in Saginaw. Everyone is just trying to claim damage out there. They are keeping my driver there.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Can you clarify?\n\n\n&gt;SP: Yeah, they pulled a big ass fucking pickup truck behind his tow truck so he can't leave and they are demanding he tow the vehicle. They need to let him leave or I will have him call the police, he's on the other line now.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Well, this is a new one. Let me get a supervisor in one this, we'll get back to you.\n\n\n&gt;SP: Sure thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, I get up and grab a supv, and tell them about the situation. They in turn go and grab one of our call managers (basically service call trackers) to sit at my desk and work the call. I give her the run down of the situation, and she lets me split into the headset to hear the call. She calls the member back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;AF: Finally! This is such poor service! He's threatening my husband! \n\n\n&gt;CM: Ma'am did you block the driver's exit?\n\n\n&gt;AF: That's ridic-\n\n\n&gt;CM: DID YOU BLOCK THE DRIVER'S EXIT?? (little bit more forcefully)\n\n\n&gt;AF: HE'S REFUSING TO TOW OUR VEHICLE. HE CANNOT LEAVE UNTIL HE DOES HIS FUCKING JOB. WE PAY A LOT OF MONEY ($50/year, for the record) FOR THIS SERVICE AND REFUSE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS!!\n\n\n&gt;CM: They are miles out of their service area and we do not require them to tow your vehicle. Furthermore, if you do not let the driver leave right now, I WILL contact the police and press kidnapping charges, and your membership will be terminated without refund. How would you like to proceed?\n\n\n&gt;AF: FUCK YOU, YOU BITCH WHORE SLUT (actually what she said) WE PAY FOR THIS AND WILL GET SERVICE. YOU WON'T DO SHIT, YOU CUNT!!\n\n\n&gt;CM: So we will be sending the police to {address} and terminating your membership. I am going to disconnect the call now, have a-\n\n\n&gt;AF: Wait!!! (to her husband in the background) Frank, move the truck. (To us) But I want a supervisor! This is awful service. I want this call credited back.\n\n\n&gt;CM: I am the supervisor (she wasn't), ma'am, and I will not be crediting you anything. You held a man against his will and you are lucky we are not pressing charges. I am disconnecting the call now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo after all that, the driver was able to leave unharmed, police were unfortunately not involved, and, while her membership was not terminated, every service provider within 50 miles blacklisted her.\n\n\nWhat the fuck possessed this crazy lady and her husband to do this? How in God's name did you think this was ok and that it would work out in your favor? What is is about these memberships that turn people into petulant children?\n\n\nI learned later that the driver/service provider did press charges. Don't know what happened after that. Hopefully these people ended up in jail or a mental institution. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Realized I typed call manager as DI vs. CM. Whoopsiee doodles. Fixed.\n\n2nd Edit: Broke up with some empty space, hopefully easier to read.",

I have cut out some if the irrelevant chat.\n\nBackground for some people who may not know about premium SMS charges: You can sign up for various services using your mobile and they will charge the cost of the service to your phone bill by sending a chargeable SMS. Some if these services can be competition entries, wallpapers for your phone or in the good old days you bought ringtones.\n\nMe= me\nW= wife\nH= husband\n\nMe: (opening script)\n\nW: I've noticed some fraudulent charges on my phone bill and I want them refunded.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, I will look at your bills and get this sorted. I can see that you have been receiving some messages from the number 8XXXX. This is typically a charge fir a service that the user of the mobile has signed up to.\n\nW: That is not true, I have not signed up to ANYTHING. This is fraud, refund me NOW!!\nMe: I understand how frustrated you feel however I can see that these messages have been sent to your phone after you sent an initial text to the same number on (date and time)\n\nW: Are you deaf? I just told you I haven't!! Are you calling me a liar?\n\nMe: Not at all, could there have been someone with access to the phone?\n\nW: No way! It was with me the whole time and i didnt use it at all that day.\n\nMe: Ok, I have to explain that I do see a reasonable amount of calls and text messages being sent just before and after the text to 8XXXXX. They seem like genuine usage as they are to the same numbers that are frequently contacted.\n\nW: I don't care, I'm still telling you that I...DID...NOT...SUBSCRIBE...TO...ANYTHING!\n\nMe: I understand, I am just going to try find out what service it seems to be and which company runs it, then maybe we can conference them into this call to get it resolved.\n\nW: **Reluctantly Agrees...can gear angry husband in the background calling me and the company all sorts of names**\n\nMe: (with the biggest grin on my face but trying to prevent her from hearing my joy) the company running this service seems to be called xxx and there are multiple services subscribed to, such as 'Big Boobs XXX' and 'w@nk bank hardcore'. \n\nW: Hold on!

This is my husbands phone and he will call back later to sort this out *click*\n\nI loved proving rude people wrong, especially when they lie (oh this phone is never our of my sight...actually my husband uses this phone)",

It could be that you have your pop ups blocked and it won't download because of that reason.\n\n**TCG**: Ok umm I'm using the browser with the red,green and yellow circle with a blue dot in the middle.\n\n**PJ**: Ok great so you're using google chrome. So to disable to the pop up blocker you need to go the right hand side of the screen near the top right, there will be three dots next to the address bar, that's to access your settings, once you click on it you hit the button that says \"settings\".\n\n**TCG**: Ok...I have no idea what a 'google chrome' is but I found the three dots and clicked it but I don't see settings.\n\n**PJ**: Ok that's fine, if you have clicked the three dots you select settings. It's the third one from the bottom.\n\n**TCG**: THERE IS NOTHING THERE I SEE DOWNLOADS, HISTORY AND BOOKMARKS BUT THERE IS NO DAMN SETTINGS.\n\n**PJ**: Sir it's the third one from the bottom.

This man was obviously in his early-mid 30's and he just wouldn't listen to a word I was trying to tell him. \n\nWhy are people so damn hateful to the people who genuinely are trying to help them? \n\nSo I do deeply apologize to the next agent who gets this horrible man, but I did document the account accordingly so you know what to expect. \n\nAlso, I hope this man takes a basic computer literacy class.

That would mean that you cable and internet would had been turned off until it has been settled with your provider.

You'll have to check with your provider. \n\n****************\n\nThese calls happen more often than I'm comfortable with. Usually from housewives in their 30s or 40s. I had a coworker stay and troubleshoot for a woman for an hour thinking that they had internet connection.

        "text": "One of the coolest guys I've ever known sat across my cube at our call center. He had a weird magnetism about him. Which was odd because he was NOT a people person at all. He once asked for my help on how to get people to leave him alone when he was out shopping. People kept approaching him.\n\n\nAnywho, he staffed our email inbox, replying to people who contacted us via email and occasionally calling them. He'd only get on the phones if we had a long queue. So he'd be someone I'd check in with after I was out for a few days. Did anyone write in about one of my cases? Did anyone leave him a voicemail?\n\n\nThen one day he blew my mind.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Any emails while I was out?\n\n&gt;Him: Nah.\n\n&gt;Me: How about voicemails?\n\n&gt;Him: No on that too and Dave you might as well stop asking about that.\n\n&gt;Me: Huh? How so?\n\n&gt;Him: I don't have voicemail.\n\n&gt;Me: What?\n\n&gt;Him: I forgot to set up my voicemail box when I was hired. Then I realized that not getting voicemails made my job easier.\n\n&gt;Me: That was years ago. You still don't have a voicemail box?\n\n&gt;Him: Nope. I did the same thing on my personal phone too. One of the best decisions I've ever made. No voicemails.\n\n&gt;Me: How on Earth have you gotten away with this for the last four years? We even had a blast last year updating the template for our voicemail greeting. Why hasn't $Supervisor said anything? \n\n&gt;Him: I'm not sure that he cares. As long as the work gets done. And almost everyone emails me anyway. I'm not on the phones you know.\n\n&gt;Me: But $Manager definitely cares. She'd bust a gut if she knew this. \"Professionalism\" and whatnot.\n\n&gt;Him: We both know that without $Supervisor she is clueless. As long as no one tells her she'll never know.\n\n&gt;Me: Do you think it's too late for me to delete my voicemail box? Accidentally I mean. I had a client leave me an 8 minute long voicemail yesterday. And most of it was her talking to herself. The only thing of value was her phone number and the case number which she recited at the very end.\n\n&gt;Him: The trick is to incompetently fail into efficiency. You're trapped buddy. Now back to work Dave.\n\n\nHe eventually left us for greener pastures. So did I out of the call center to our tech group. To his point I don't think I've gotten a voicemail in years myself. About a year ago I realized that as part of troubleshooting someone from our telco group had inadvertently deleted my voicemail box. At some point. I hadn't noticed and apparently no one else has either.",

        "text": "Back in my call center days, I did a lot of drugs. So did all of my friends. It helped that most of the time, Frenchy and the rest of my circle of friends were working graveyard shift.\n\nIt wasn't uncommon for any of us to be fucked out of our gourds on shift, but we generally tried not to draw attention to our rampant drug abuse.\n\nNot Frenchy, though. Frenchy seriously didn't give half a fuck about your corporate drug free work environment.\n\nFrom the cubicle beside me I kept hearing the crinkle of tin foil and then a lighter sparking.\n\nI put the caller on hold and leaned around the divider. And there he was, free-basing heroin.\n\n\"Frenchy! What the fuck are you doing?\"\n\nHe turned to me and in the thickest French accent said, \"It is okay. I have him on mute.\"\n\nThey actually did end up firing him for drug use... But, not the way that you are probably thinking.\n\nSee, most of the shift leads knew about my group's rampant drug use, most of them were participants, so we only ever got \"randomly selected\" for a piss test when the shift leads knew we were clean enough to pass. It helped that we were the top performers in the company, so they really didn't want to have to get rid of us for something as dumb as doing drugs (mostly) on our own time. \n\nFrenchy was also a pretty self-aware junkie. He managed to keep himself in check for a long time, but as soon as he realized that he was losing control of his heroin addiction - he checked himself into an out-patient rehab program.\n\nIt wasn't great, but he could use his insurance for it and they wouldn't report it to his boss.\n\nThe problem is, when you have an addiction like that, and you are going clean, there's some unfortunate physical side effects. Tremors, seizures, involuntary convulsions, you know... Things like that.\n\nBut, Frenchy was still going strong. He was smoking pot to help keep himself calm and to take the edge off between doses of methadone or whatever it was they were giving him to get him off the smack.\n\nOne night, as he was hanging up his phone, he had a convulsion and knocked his computer monitor off the desk. It cracked the screen when it hit the ground.\n\nUnfortunately for Frenchy, damage to company property is an immediate UA. \n\nSo, he pissed in the little cup and they sent it off for testing.\n\nAbout a week later, results come back and he popped hot for heroin. They were all set to fire him for it, but then he countered with his prescription for methadone and got his doctor to write a note explaining the rehab aspect.\n\nPoor bosses now can't fire him for this because it's a prescription from a doctor and while there wasn't nearly as good of worker protections back then, there were some.\n\nInstead, they made him piss in a cup again and this time tested it for everything they could. And he popped for marijuana use, so they fired him.\n\nI haven't seen Frenchy in more than a decade and last I heard he got deported back to France, but I often think of him fondly and hope he's doing okay.\n\nHeh, just talking about UAs, reminds me of the time I nearly got fired from that place for pulling my dick out in HR and pissing in the guys cup.",

He'd been there longer than most manglement had been. And he had never received a customer complaint against him.\n\nSo, the management decided that it would be really nice of them to recognize his accomplishment and have him pass on his knowledge to the rest of the phone jockeys.\n\nThey called a meeting (seriously, they made me come in on my day off for this stupid meeting) and once it began, they called Frenchy up to the front.\n\n\"You all know Frenchy, if not by name than by exploits and stories. What you may not have known, is that Frenchy has never had a bad survey. Not a single complaint. He's the only person in this entire building to have a perfect customer satisfaction score. So, we're going to give him a $10 gift card to Barnes and Noble, and ask him to share some of his tips and knowledge with you.\"\n\nFrenchy kind of shuffled his feet and looked really embarrassed. They handed him the gift card and asked him to share his number one tip for keeping customers happy.\n\nAnd so he did.\n\nBefore I share Frenchy's number one tip, you have to know that we were in Utah. Utah county, Utah, to be precise. So, most of the people that were working here were Mormon and generally super sheltered from \"coarse language\".\n\nAnyways, Frenchy, in his ridiculously thick, stereotypical French accent, looks out at the group of us and said, \"You give them a verbal blowjob. You can call the stupid fuckers whatever you want, you can say whatever the fuck you want, so long as your verbal dick is jammed into their ear cunt and you slide it in gently.\"\n\nManagement interrupted him at this point and thanked him.

So lots of people call trying to order our competitors items, thinking it’s us. Because they are the first search result and old people can’t tell what’s an ad and what’s not.\n\n-Customers think they can type our name without “.com” into the address bar and reach our site. They don’t understand what the google search results page is.\n\n-On the checkout page, it gives you an option to type in a promo code at the bottom. Next to this box is an “update” button to update your cart with the promo code. Below all that is the “review order and finish” button. Apparently no one sees that button and they think if they hit “update” that should bring them to the review order screen.\n\nAnd that’s just a tiny snippet.

Aaron my financial advisor at FA. \n*(Okay, now I’m intrigued because she knows of FA, and that her advisor apparently has the same name. Also note that FA and MC are not similar sounding companies at all)*\n\nMe: No sorry, my company MC works does financial analysis and you are looking for your financial advisor. \n*(I didn’t even want to explain that FA is connected to us)*\n\nOL: Alright, thanks! So after Christmas I balanced my checkbook and blah blah.... *she begins to ramble on about her finances, particularly her grandkid’s tuition, her heating bill, Christmas shopping, electronics, medical bills, etc.*\n\nMe: I’m sorry to interrupt. I really think you have the wrong number. Can I give you the number for your financial advisor?\n\nOL: I’M ON A FIXED INCOME!!!!\n\n*I had to pull the phone from my ear because she screamed so loud*\n\nMe: I am not your financial advisor. You called the wrong number. I’ll find the correct number and you can call them. \n*I normally would’ve hung up but FA is our client so I felt like that would be wrong* \n\nOL: Well you know what? My new iPhone isn’t working and I was told to buy it for my hearing aids and it doesn’t work at all! I don’t even know how to use it! Won’t even turn on! I would never take advice from someone so rude. *hangs up*\n\n...\n\nI sat there for a while, so confused. I was also a little annoyed because she clearly called me from an iPhone. After a quick search I got ahold of her advisor’s number, and discovered that her advisor Erin is a female. That also pissed me off because I hopefully sound masculine even with her hearing aids. \n\nI call up this Erin and let her know to call the old lady back. She said this lady is a repeat offender and has called her personal cell phone, her home landline, her sister, and her fiancee’s cell phone. Apparently she can’t work an iPhone but can get ahold of anyone. \n\nI’m not answering the phone unless it’s from a client from now on. ",

        "text": "Bit of info - worked for 2 years at a call center, as a roadside assistance dispatcher. Your car breaks down, you call me, I send help. I'd like to post a few things that only fellow call center agents would understand. No matter what type of customer service industry you're in, customer stupidity is universal.\n\n1. **MY BIGGEST GRIPE EVER**. Female customers trying to play the 'I'm a woman on my own' card, thinking it'll make me feel more sorry for them or bust my ass to get them help. The quickest ETA we can ever initially advise is 60 minutes, and that's in emergencies. I've had women who were safely in their own homes who've tried to pull that bs. I once had a woman call in for a flat tyre - she said she had a spare and the tools to change it, but couldn't do it, because (and I quote) 'I'm a woman, so obviously ...' \n\nMe: 'ok, just to confirm, your registration is A for alpha, B for Bravo, six zero, C for charlie, D for delta, E for echo?'\n\nCustomer: 'AB60CDE.'\n\n Me: 'so Alpha bravo, six zero, charlie delta echo?'\n\nCustomer: *sighs like I'm mentally challenged* 'A ... B .. SIX! ZERO! C. D. and ... E'\n\nMe: 'yes, I'd like to confirm phonetically. Alpha bravo sixo zero charlie delta echo.'\n\nCustomer: 'Yes. That's it.'\n\nMe: 'okay, I'm not getting a policy on that.' *I confirm the reg phonetically again*\n\nCustomer: *now angry 'No, it's not B for .. it's not B for 'BUCKET', it's V for .. it's V! V for 'vogue'! I'm on the side of the road right now, can you just do it now please?'\n\n^TL;DR; when customers confirm their details after I repeat them back to them, and then it's my own fault when the details they gave were incorrect.\n\n\n2. Me: 'sure! I'd be glad to help! Can I start by taking the last 5 digits of your account number please?'\n\nCustomer: 'Yeah, it's 123456789.'\n\nMe: 'sorry, just the last 5 will do.'\n\nCustomer: 'can't you work that out from the entire number?'\n\nMe: 'sorry, I can't take the full number for data protection reasons. I just need the last 5 digits, please.'\n\nCustomer: *sighs audibly at my idiocy* 'ok ... so ... 9 ... 8 ... uhm, 7 ... hang on, let me cover up the first part with my thumb ...'\n\n3. **CUSTOMERS SOMETIMES STRUGGLE SO MUCH WITH SIMPLE QUESTIONS**. When a customer calls in, it's either to report a new case of breakdown, or is calling about an existing file. Both are looked up/created by inputting the car registration. \n\n Customer: 'Hi, that was a long wait ha ha. What do you need from me first, is it my registration?'\n\n Me: 'Yes, are we currently assisting you or is this for a new breakdown case?'\n\n Customer: 'yes.'\n\n Me: 'sorry ... Is this for an ongoing case or a new breakdown case?'\n\n Customer: 'oh ... uhm ... err ... what do you mean?' (100% not lying, customers would for some reason struggle so much to answer this)\n\n Me: 'so, are you calling about a new breakdown, or are you calling for an ongoing assistance?'\n\n Customer: 'well, I'd say it's technically ongoing, since I've been having problems with this car since last June. So yes, it's for a current assistance.'\n\n Me: *giving them the benefit of the doubt* 'ok, i'll input your registration to pull up your file. ... okay, I can't find any record of assisting this vehicle?'\n\n Customer: 'that's because you haven't assisted it.'\n\n Me: 'I did ask if this was a current assistance and you said -'\n\n Customer: 'yes, it's because you're GOING to assist it, obviously.'\n\nI have a lot more than these generic issues. I have plenty of memorable customers, some good and some absolutely awful. Now I have nothing but respect for call center workers, and always think about the crap I had to endure daily, when I have to call one myself. I'm never mad about wait times (sometimes we'd have 50 calls holding, but according to management, it was because we were just 'too slow', not short staffed), and I'm always conscious of t ]he fact that when I need to call a center, the agent I'm speaking to is most likely reading from a script to fix my issue, and is in no way technically trained (we were told certain issues with vehicles were not an urgent issue, and to tell customers the same thing. I always hated doing this because I don't even drive, and felt bad for assuring people their car was fine to drive when I didn't know for sure).\n\nAnyway, managed to get myself a job as a PA. My last day at the CC was a mixture of euphoria, sadness (made some amazing friends), and fear. Mostly fear, because even though I was miserable at the CC, I stayed there for longer than I should've, because it was comfortable and familiar. \n\nSometimes i think about doing an AMA, but don't think there'd be much interest. Everyone who's worked in a CC would give similar answers to myself.\n\nStay strong, guys. As mentioned before, I got nothing but respect for CC employees. \n\nP.S. sorry for bad formatting. ",

I explained that the managers were in meetings and she told me again that this is bad customer service.

        "text": "I'm a mostly email and chat rep in a contact center for Company, a retailer that has a long-standing reputation for excellent customer service and just all-around being easy to deal with. (We really are!) Like many retailers, Christmas is our busiest time of year, so stress and emotions can run high for our customers.\n\nThis year, things were complicated by our dedicated shipper deciding that the week before Christmas was an awesome time to recycle a bunch of old tracking numbers from last year, triggering our system to send out incorrect emails to our customers telling them that their order had been delivered. In 2016. To a city that was nowhere near them.\n\nClusterrific!\n\nCustomers then looked on the front porch, saw nothing, and went back to their email, clicked the tracking link, and then freaked the fuck OUT. Their calls were shrieked variations of, \"OH MY GODDDDD YOU PEOPLE SUCK MY PACKAGE WAS JUST DELIVERED TO PEORIAAAAAA NOW CHRISTMAS IS RUINED AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAAAAAULT! MY LIFE IS OVERRRRRR! HOOOOW ARE YOU PEOPLE GOING TO GET MY ORDER FROM PEORIA TO PHOENIX IN TIME FOR CHRIIIIIIISTMAAAAAAAS???\" \n\nOnce they stopped shrieking we had to explain about the recycled tracking numbers and let them know that everything is groovy with shipping and not to worry.\n\nThen blizzards happened. Packages were late, and of course the people who waited until the last possible second to place their orders blamed us because how could they possibly anticipate that it might possibly SNOW at CHRISTMASTIME, slowing down shipping? That never happens! /s\n\nEven emails from customers started coming in all in caps and bold and 24-point type (not sure why they think this impresses us but whatever). \n\nAnyway. \n\nOne of our reps was on the phone with a particularly shouty customer and finally lost it. She started shouting back. I was not there, but apparently the entire call center went as quiet as a call center can go, and several managers came running over to her station, shushing her, and making the cut-throat sign, like \"Hang up now. Rightthefuck NOW.\" *But she just kept yelling at this customer.* \n\nThey finally got her off the phone, obviously. But she has not been seen since. \n\nOn the one hand, I just smh and think, \"That was dumb, throwing away a job over one asshole.\" But part of me is secretly a little impressed that this person did what I've been tempted to do sooooo many times this season. \n\nFly free, random rep. Hope you have another job lined up.",

I can definitely help you with any issue you’re having though!\n\nGuy: why are you trying to keep me from speaking to Gary? \n\nAt this stage I explained that if he wouldn’t speak to me I have to terminate the call. \n\nGuy: you’re just an Irish cunt anyway \n\nI terminated the call. \n\nThe next day I looked around for Gary and told him about this, he told me that Guy was being a dick on the phone, shouting at him saying he was incompetent and that us Irish people don’t have two brain cells to put together. I’m not sure why he wanted to speak to Gary so badly if that’s how he thought of him!\n\nSo not an overly bad one, I definitely need to start posting here more about the bad calls to get them out of my system!

        "text": "Hey :) this is first time posting. Really enjoy reading everyone’s tales so I thought I’d share one myself. \n\nSo this happened quite recently at a Christmas temp job I just finished. Its a company that sells a range of alcohol based products (mainly wine) which customers order through a quarterly magazine. My job was mainly dealing with general enquiries and orders for customers. Most people I dealt with were quite decent and well mannered, but you always get the odd few as you all well know. \n\nThis particular call really did take the biscuit though! this guy had actually called us before even though he wasn’t a customer with us because he was actually sent a box of wine by accident. This can happen because the carrier got either the postcode or house name mixed up, so what we normally do is set up a collection from their address, or sometimes we allow them to keep the case at a discount instead. However This customer was not having any of this!\n\nI’ll be ME and annoying guy will be AG:\n\nME: good afternoon (company name) how can I help ?\n\nAG: yes! So I spoke to someone earlier about this case of wine that I received and I would like to sort this out asap please. \n\nME: ok sir I am sorry about that. Let me get this looked into for you. (Opens up search program) could I get a postcode or surname so that I can find this order for you first. \n\nAG: well no I don’t at all feel comfortable about giving out my details to you as I’m not a customer with you, I just want to sort out this case. \n\nME: I understand sir but it’s the only way I can track it to see the Order. That way I can do something about it.\n\n(AG continues to refuse to give me details. Until I relay to him that I’ve checked with a supervisor and they said that we definitely need the information)\n\nAG: ok here is my post code. \n\nME: thank you sir. So I can see that this is the order you have . (I explain the reason why the error occurred). I do apologise sir , what I’ll do for you is I can set up a collection for you now which will be within 3 to 4 working days. \n\nAG: no I’m not going to do that! This is my holiday home so I won’t be in. \n\nME: not a problem sir, if you leave it in a safe place outside your property we can collect it from there instead. \n\nAG: no I’m not happy with just leaving it outside where people can see! Can you just write it off as it was your mistake not mine? \n\nME: sir I understand your concern but as it is our responsibility we will need to collect the item. Alternatively if you wanted to keep the case we could give you £40 off it. That is the best offer we can do. \n\nAG: no I don’t want to pay for the case. If you want to collect it then that’s fine but I need to know exactly when it will be so that I can be in. If not then you should write it off. \n\nME: sir as it is our busiest time of year we cannot guarantee an exact or time for carrier arrivals. The only thing I can suggest is I can get our delivery team to ring you in a day or two to give you more details. \n\nAG: no I am not giving out anymore details to anyone. \n\n\n(So this basically goes back and forth. Clearly the guy is just being difficult as he wants us to hand him the case for free. But because this was just a complete no so I had no choice but to carry on relaying the same options to him. )\n\nME: Sir the only option is have then is to set up the collection and perhaps we can send you a letter notification using the details we already have. \n\nAG: someone can call me as long as they tell me exactly when it will get collected. \n\nME: we cannot guarantee anything sir but I can set up an exact date for the collection which they may be able to do. Also as a goodwill gesture you are welcome to keep a few bottles from the case as this was our mistake. \n\nAG: well really you should let me have the whole case! (Cases of wine are worth over £100 btw) but anyway if they don’t come I will be taking this up to management! \n\nME: no problem sir I will get that sorted. Thank you for your call. \n\nSo yea he didn’t get his way no matter what excuse he tried to pull up. I did get that it was an inconvenience but there’s no way we would have allowed him to keep a case of expensive wine that wasn’t his. I mean why call us if it was too much hassle to do anything ? \n\nThanks for reading! ",

Tell her I'm unavailable.\"\n\nWell, guess what happened? She escalated to corporate. She flew off the handle, man. Not like she wasn't there before, but she decided to skydive off the empire state building. I started soft and sweet, so sorry. She cut me off. \n\nWhen they get this crazy, I don't use soft and sweet. I get snippy right back. Like borderline, \"you know what, no.

Are you listening?\"\n\n\"I am, and sorry. What is the best contact number?\"\n\nShe calms down a bit. But again mentions escalating to corporate. Nice me comes out again. According to policy, if they threaten corporate, she needs to go up the escalation chain, or I'm in trouble. She's no longer allowed to leave my phone until a superior takes over. \n\nCalls lead over. Waits 5 minutes now. Same lead, same answer. And I finally turned to him, and said really dumb and sweetly, \"she's asking for corporate now. And your name. What number should I give her?\"\n\nTook him like 10 more minutes, but he finally did. Wasted 20 mins of everyone's time, and just escalated her more.\n\nLike dude. Take the freaking call. This is policy. This is your job description. I wouldn't send this to you if I could handle it.

During my probationary period I once listened to him for five minutes and didn't understand a single word he said. This always infuriated him when you couldn't understand him. He'd start yelling and hitting things. But a few folks there had taken his calls for years and had learned how to interpret his mumbling. If there was no queue and they were free (and willing to to do it) they would take his calls.\n\n\nAfter about two years I got the hang of his speech too. Enough to fully realize the *real* problem with his calls. $Harold didn't make bets. He almost always just wanted to know the morning line for upcoming races and the results for past ones. That combined with his slow and unclear speech meant you could easily spend 10 minutes with him and he wouldn't make a bet. He had funded his account, but never actually made bets. (Or almost never, as part of one call with me he did place two bets.)\n\n\nIn our call center the average call was about 40 seconds if I remember correctly. The record for the shortest call when I was there was 10 seconds (bet placed with process followed, I took the bet). It was always about speed. When a race is about to go off you only have so many minutes to get in all the bets before that opportunity is lost forever. Occasionally I'd hang up on a customer when they weren't ready with their next bet. The goal was to have no queue just before the race closed. So time with $Harold was time wasted; we could have been productively clearing the queue. However, he never saw it this way. He never cared about anybody else. Ever.\n\n\nShortly before I left I talked to some people who had taken $Harold's bets when the call center first opened. He wasn't always this way. He had gotten whacked in the head during a bar fight. Someone hit him with a brick a couple times. Apparently $Harold was an a------- before the fight. And after the fight. Just after the fight he was hard to understand.\n\n\nShortly before I left I happened to be walking by one of our new agents on a break. I overhead her talk in such a way that she was obviously on a call with $Harold. She seemed confused and intimidated (the yelling, the pounding) so I volunteered to talk to him and took the phone from her and leaned over her cube wall.\n\n\nMy last conversation with Harold went like this (H = $Harold, M = Me. I'll just type what I thought Harold was saying, I was pretty good at this point).\n\n\n&gt;M: Hello sir. I can help you from here.\n\n&gt;H: Who is this?\n\n&gt;M: This is Dave. My coworker was having some trouble understanding you so I took the call.\n\n&gt;H: I want to know the results of the last race from Aqueduct.\n\n&gt;M: I'm sorry sir I can't understand what you're saying.\n\n&gt;H: I don't believe you. I think you can understand what I'm saying.\n\n&gt;M: It makes no difference if you believe me or not. I really can't understand what you're saying.\n\n&gt;H: THAT'S CRAP! I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND ME!\n\n&gt;M: Really I don't.\n\n&gt;H: *More yelling and pounding the table.*\n\n&gt;M: *Hangs up*.\n\n\nTo my knowledge he never called back. Which thrilled one of our bosses.",

        "text": "In my years of working for the Answering Service, I have accepted that some employees will abuse the system. Instead of calling the direct line to the main office, they will have an Agent pass along the bad news. \n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for calling [Company], My name is BV. How may I be of service?\n\n&gt;Employee: (coughs a few times) Could you tell my supervisor I'm not coming into work today? I'm sick. (Forces a few coughs). I would come in, but contagious and all. My employee ID is [numbers].\n\n&gt;Me: Oh. I'm so sorry. Not a problem. Just let me pull up the pro-.\n\nLooking through the types of messages I can leave and the procedures, I notice there isn't one for this situation. But there is a procedure for \"Personal Calls\". Before I could do that, I needed supervisor approval. Just in case Quality Assurance was going to listen to this call and criticize me.\n\nI politely ask to place the employee on hold and call my supervisor. I inform my supervisor of the call and the lack of procedure for this situation. Supervisor informs me that it's because employees must call the main office to call in sick. He also notes that the main office is still open, so the employee had to call the Answering Service number to reach me. It was apparent that the employee was trying to make me the bearer of bad news. \n\nMy supervisor gives me the green light to inform the employee they must call the main office. But it the employee persists, use Personal Call protocol. \n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for holding, Sir. I apologize but it appears you have to call the main office's direct line to call in sick. I can give you that number, if you'd like.\n\n&gt;Employee: ...I can't take the number down... (coughs more) Don't want to spread germs. Can't you just relay the message for me? Just tell them to use my paid sick time. They'll understand.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry, but I feel like this would be a better discussion between you and your supervisor. I don't know the policy on how your paid time off is used and I would feel terrible if I messed it up. \n\n&gt;Employee: It's be fine. Just tell my supervisor and I'll take care of it tomorrow. \n\n&gt;Me: Ok, Sir. May I place you on hold again?\n\nI pull up the instructions for relaying personal calls to the main office. The instructions are simple: Call the main office and ask for the person the message is for. I sigh to myself and dial. \n\nWith each ring, I grow more anxious. I loathe these types of calls. I get the blunt end of the misplaced disappointment. All the questions I cannot answer will frustrate them more. When the line picks up, I brace myself for a verbal beating.\n\n&gt;Me: Hello. This is BV with the Answering Service. May I speak to the supervisor?\n\n&gt;Supervisor: I am the supervisor. How may I help you?\n\n&gt;Me: The answering service received a call from an Employee ID [number]. He requested we relay a message on his behalf. \n\n&gt;Supervisor: Oh really now?\n\n&gt;Me: Yes. He states that he is sick and will not be coming into work today. He requested we tell you that he would like his paid sick time used. \n\n&gt;Supervisor: (chuckles) He is such a piece of work. His shift started two hours ago. I've been trying to call him, but he never answered. And he called you to tell me this? Why didn't he just call me back?\n\nThe supervisor goes on a rant about how unprofessional the employee is being. Apparently, the employee has done this before and no longer had paid time off to use. All during this, his voice sounded livid and filtered through a forced smile. \n\n&gt;Me: My apologies, Sir. It appears that he is still on the line. If you'd like, I could transfer him to you. \n\n&gt;Supervisor: Please do. Thank you. \n\nI transferred the employee to the supervisor, disconnecting. It was a cold move, but I decided it was the best choice. ",

        "text": "So, I work at a call center. I book hotels for one specific chain (so not like any travel websites; I'm just the one hotel chain).\n\nHad a dude call in tonight who's at the highest tier of our rewards program. Perfectly fine, perfectly normal, happens all the time.\n\nThe dude is having a hard time thinking in English (I guess he speaks several languages) and has to try a couple times to tell me the phone number to look up the account. That's no big deal, it happens. I speak two languages and my thought process is a clusterfuck. I get it.\n\nI can't find the account with the phone number. He starts getting super heated. He's also really pissed that I don't magically know where the FUCK this dude is right now. \"I'm standing in your lobby!\" Okay great; which fucking one?\n\nFinally he hands me over to the FDA. She tells me the property code. I've gotten some of his account verified. However, I have to have three pieces of information in order to do anything with an account, especially pull points for a reservation.\n\nThat last bit is important, because it's exactly why he called us. They can't do points at our front desk; it's all handled on the back end in call centers. It's not uncommon for guests to call from the lobby to book the room. Fine, whatever. But I'm still going to need you to verify the phone number or member number. (Email and street addresses checked out.)\n\nHe starts losing his fucking mind about this. Screaming about \"do you remember the phone number you had nine years ago?!\" Yes. Because I've had the same one my whole life. He demands I tell it to him, and that's the most unproductive thing of this whole call so far because I shut that shit down super quick.\n\nHe finally screams that he wants a supervisor. I went around and around with this dude for like 4-5 minutes, too, on both \"which property are you at so I can pull up the rooms\" and \"can you please verify a third piece of information for me\". At some point he also threatened to fly to the Philippines to tell me how to do my job. (Why does everyone think we're there? Our tech people and the people who make our schedules are, but not us???)\n\nSo I grab my manager and tell her what's up. She looks leery because she, too, hates screaming men. She gets on the phone, he screams for a bit about the \"durka durka\" Indian lady at the front desk (no clue), and then the FDA gets on the line.\n\nShe apologizes PROFUSELY to my manager and says that the only reason these shenanigans are going on is because he has a little girl who looks super sick, and this dude could probably be mistaken for a cocktail with how he smells and looks.\n\nSo we get the room pushed through; my manager has another software and he can verify the last date of stay on the account. Everything is hunky dory for this dude (minus the incoming security the FDA brought in on the DL).\n\nIMMEDIATELY his tone shifts as my supervisor is saying \"make sure he knows to update the account so this doesn't happen again\". He profusely apologizes and starts saying \"oh man I didn't mean to act that way thanks for all the help dude\" and hangs up.\n\nJust... wow. I thought Jackass of the Week was going to go to last night's 40 minute call that went 18 minutes over my shift end; dude wouldn't shut the fuck up. Nope, this jackass gets the trophy.",

        "text": "The holidays are Answering Service hell.\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for calling Heating and Cooling Company, My name is BV. How may I be of service?\n\n&gt;Customer: This is Officer Douche, this is [Owner]'s heater repair service?\n\nThe introduction took me by surprise. We normally get calls from people who were cops calling in as customers. But never has any of them addressed themselves as \"Officer [name]\". \n\n&gt;Me: Yes, sir. The company is owned by [Owner] and he does offer repairs for heating systems. \n\n&gt;Customer: Ah. Okay. So I received a 911 call from an elderly woman by the name of [Old lady]. She states she's been without heat for some time and when she called your company yesterday, the employee said they couldn't send anyone out. \n\n&gt;Me: I understand. One moment, Sir. I need to pull up that message.\n\nI search through the message history for the Heating &amp; Cooling company. The Old lady had apparently called in Christmas eve around 11pm. She had stated she had been without a proper heating system for a month. She demanded an emergency technician be sent over, but was denied. The Agent had followed standard protocol, offering numbers to competing companies, shelters and the like. Of course, She didn't want to hear it, berated the Agent then hung up. \n\n&gt;Me: The previous message does state an [Old lady] called in last night, requesting an emergency technician. Unfortunately, emergency technicians will not be available until December 27th. \n\n&gt;Customer: Yeah. I get that. But (scoffs) She's forty-six and visibly shaken. Her skin is so pale and you can (breaths out heavily) see your breathe. Her health is seriously at risk. Can you send someone and bill her later? \n\n&gt;Me: My apologies, Sir. I am unable to schedule an emergency technician as they are not available. I understand how frustrating this can be. But what I can do is schedule an appointment for the 27th, placing her as a top priority. \n\n&gt;Customer: We need someone today. She is at risk. \n\n&gt;Me: Again, my apologies. I am unable to send someone today. \n\nThere were a few moments of dead air, before the Customer replied back. But this time it was different. The tone in his voice had grown stern and demanding.\n\n&gt;Customer: I don't think you've heard me. Send someone out to fix this now. \n\n&gt;Me: Sir, I am unable to send someone over as they are not available. Though I am unable to help with that, I do have other options. [Other company] has emergency technicians working today. Or [Old lady] can attend several warm shelters for tonight such as [Shelter 1] or [Shelter 2]. \n\n&gt;Customer: I'm not going to wait on hold with some other company for ten hours. And [Old lady] has every right to spend Christmas in the comfort of her soon-to-be warm home. Send. Someone. Now.\n\n&gt;Me: My apol-\n\n&gt;Customer: Do I have to report you to the Better Business Bureau?\n\n&gt;Me:..... May I place you on hold, Sir?\n\nThe customer didn't respond for over a minute so I placed him on hold. \n\nFor this company, they had special procedures when someone uttered buzzwords like \"Suing\" and \"Better Business Bureau\". I was instructed to call the Owner and inform him of the displeased customer. \n\n&gt;Me: Hello, Mr.[Owner]. This is BV with the Answering Service. My sincerest apologies for bothering you on a Holiday. \n\n&gt;Owner: It's no problem, BV. So how are you? How is Christmas treating you? Hope not too bad.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry, but I insist we skip the formalities. There is a customer on the line threatening to report [Company] to the Better Business Bureau. He says he's a police officer. \n\n&gt;Owner: (Sighs) What did [Technician] do this time?\n\n&gt;Me: It's not that. An elderly woman tried to schedule an emergency repair appointment yesterday but was denied.\n\n&gt;Owner: Of course. It's the holidays. \n\n&gt;Me: I understand. Apparently she called the police and now the officer is demanding an emergency tech be sent out now. He says she is visibly shaking, pale and \"at risk\".\n\n&gt;Owner: If she's that physically ill, why doesn't he just take her to a hospital?\n\n&gt;Me: I'm unsure...He says she deserves to spend Christmas at home.\n\n&gt;Owner: (Sighs) I'll take the call. But can you three way it, but mute yourself. I need this on a recorded line. \n\nI conference the call, muting myself. The customer is muttering to himself about how long I was taking and how I was useless. Standard irate customer things. \n\n&gt;Owner: Hello. This is [Owner] with [Company]. How may I help you, sir?\n\n&gt;Customer: I need an emergency technician sent out immediately. This poor woman is freezing to death. She felt the need to call 911 because no one would help her.\n\n&gt;Owner: I get what you're saying, but I have no employees available today. It's Christmas and they are spending time with loved ones. Now I can set up an emergency appointment with [Rival company] and even pay half the bill. As a formal apology.\n\nA smart man would have taken the offer. The customer was not a smart man. \n\n&gt;Customer: No. Send someone over now. Or I'm not only reporting you to the Better Business Bureau, but I will post online about this. About how you neglected the elderly on Christmas. \n\n&gt;Owner: If I send someone over..You do know there are additional fees due to the Holidays. Getting a tech out there today would be very costly. I'm talking about maybe hun-. \n\n&gt;Customer: I don't care the cost, just send someone over here now! I'll pay the bill if I have to!\n\n&gt;Owner: Someone will be over right away.\n\n&gt;Customer: Thank you. Was that so hard? (Hangs up).\n\nI relayed [Old lady]'s address to the Owner from her previous message. The Owner sighed and wished me a Merry Christmas. \n\nConclusion:\n\nToday, I got called into Upper Management's office. I felt anxious because there was someone from legal there. Apparently, the Owner had gone himself to repair the heating system. The Customer was present in uniform, waiting. The Owner had the Customer fill out some forms before he would start. The Customer didn't read them, but instead signed and told Owner to get to work. The forms pretty much stated the Customer was going to pay outrageous fees for the repair. Legal and Management wanted my consent to use the recording of the call because the Customer threatened to sue. He wasn't too happy about the bill. \n\n*edit: misspelled some words. ",

        "text": "Hello, Started working in a call centre for my first \"proper\" full time job around 2011, I was really happy to have a job with decent pay for once. \n\nWhen I first applied I was offered a chilled job resolving problems for customer whilst only working six hours a day. After six months I applied for a full time job and at the time as I have 0% sickness I qualified for the role which I was happy about. When I first started the new team I was met with a cuddley happy Manager who we will call \"mumzy\" who played a bit of a awkward \"mother role\" - Im sure we have all have a manager like that if you get me. Then one day I missed a bit of the training for a reason I can't forgot. ( I think I had appointment or so in the morning and went back to work ) as I was leaving that beatiful june evening I felt the screek of terror as I heard the name call, It was \"mumsy\" and the thought of happyness sunshire then turned to dread. She was stood there and insisted I worked the time back, The funny thing is it wasnt \"mumzy\" it was more like nurse ratchet. Sadistic micromangement, and calculating, Got a kick from fucking someones day. \n\nEventually she dissapeared but was in the place of mysery which I call work, so I got this new guy who was even worse. \n\n. For the last five years my mind has completely melted for the mental torture for it all. Then suddenly one day I found out I personally will be losing my job with a \"paypackage\" lets put it that way. \nThe thing is at the time had about two months tops left in me to continue before I cracked in this place because if I didn't I would of got sacked, I have open discussions with my Managers etc. \n\nI am so worried because everything is recorded if I feel like shit and I work badly it wont make it to the set date for the \"paypackage\" I have exausted all options of reasonable absence and If I go sick again I could lose my job. \n\nWhen I am home I worry all the time about  thoughts like\"did I say something outloud that got recorded\" because if so I will get sacked losing this paypackage. \n\nThe trouble is guess who was lurking in the darkness, \"Mumzy\" However this time is the entire floor manager\" so she basically in my mind has control over my paypackage.

        "text": "This happened a few years back when I worked at a call center for a TV company. I took calls from customers who wanted to cancel their premium channels (HBO, Showtime etc.) and my job was to convince them to keep the channels or get a different premium channel.\n\nI got a call from a customer who was looking to cancel Cinemax. For those who don't know, Cinemax has a lot of soft core porn (sometimes referred to as skinemax) which they usually play after 9pm. He didn't seem to be interested in the action movies on Cinemax so I asked him what types of shows he liked to watch. \n\nHe replied that he enjoyed the DIY network and shows about woodworking. I then told him that after 9 o'clock Cinemax had plenty of woodworking shows. He got completely quiet. I'm not sure if he didn't understand or wasn't sure how to respond. After a long uncomfortable silence I cancelled Cinemax and told him to have a nice day.\n\n*Edited to exclude company name.",

Here is an example of an odd call that I got a while back:\n\nDG = drunk guy\n\nMe: Hello, this is ______ casino, how may I help you?\n\nDG: *a brief pause as guest scrambles for composer* Transfer me to security.\n\nMe: Okay sir, if you can give me a brief summary of what the call is in reference to I can transfer you.\n\nDG: A couple of your \"officiers\" just drug me out and kicked my ass! *with slurred words and volume shifts throughout sentence* I want their names and I'll have them fired!\n\nMe: Okay sir, and where did this happen?\n\nDG: I was eating at ______ and they said that I was drunk!\n\nMe: Okay sir well I can't transfer you to security, but if you feel that you have been abused/mishandled you can file a police report or call back later. *by later, I mean when he is sober*\n\nDG: I WANT THEIR NAMES AND YOU WILL GIVE ME THEIR NAMES *the drunk ape has become angry*\n\nMe: Sir I don't know these gentleman, and even if I did our policy states that we cannot give out names of our associates.\n\nDG: You are an asshole! I will get their names and I will have them and you fired! *Uh oh, drunko is making threats*\n\nMe: Sir, if you feel as though you were mistreated I would suggest you call back after sobering up. I can call them then. *We aren't normally supposed to be this blunt, but he wasn't getting the point*\n\nDG: *scoffs* Uh how dare you! I am not drunk *he proclaimed in slurred, delayed english*\n\nMe: You can always call the police, but I cannot help you in your current state. If you call back later I'm sure Security would be happy to investigate the issue.\n\nDG: What is your name so I can tell them about YOU!?\n\nMe: ____ is my name, and I'm the only one here with that name.\n\nDG: Bitch!\n\nMe: I cannot help you any longer, and I must now disconnect the call. Thank you. *call disconnects, I pull reddit back up to destress with dank memery*\n\n He never called back. I can only assume that he came to his senses and realized that he was making an ass of himself. ",

        "text": "This dates back almost 15 years, when I was working in a customer service call centre for the credit card division of a UK bank. We dealt mostly with credit card applications, and our calls tended to be from people who had been turned down for a credit card and weren't happy about it. \n\nOne day, I get a call from a lady about her refusal letter. We go through the identification process, and she is clearly Welsh. She has a Welsh accent, and her address is a farm with a Welsh name in the heart of Wales. \n\n(Now, some background for non-UK readers: Wales is part of the UK, but there is a reasonably-sized nationalist movement. At one stage, there were stories about holiday homes in Wales owned by English owners being burned down; I don't know how true that was.)\n\nSo, I ask the lady how I could help her. She tells me I should probably look up her refusal letter and take a look for myself. I do, and I see:  \n&gt;\"I'm sorry, but we are unable to send you a credit card because your country is too dangerous for us to deliver to.\"\n\nThis is the wording that gets used when an applicant is living in a war zone or a third-world country. You can see how this could be a problem...\n\nTurns out that some data-entry person had entered the wrong country code when inputting the address. It was just an unfortunate coincidence that this was done for a customer in deepest Wales.  Luckily, the customer thought it was hilarious. ",

        "text": "I work in a call center for a telecom company that only works with businesses, no residential customers. You would think the customers would be more professional, but sadly many are rude, with some bordering on verbally abusive. \n\nA customer called in one day asking about an order he had placed to disconnect the internet service at his convenience store. Some customers are what we refer to as \"magic button people,\" who believe that we in the call center have the ability to instantly complete their order, and that we quote 8-10 business days for order completion just to be able to charge them more money. In reality, the order is worked at multiple levels and gets put into a queue to be worked in the order in which it was submitted. This can cause delays if there are many orders in process at the same time, but generally things do happen within the quoted time frame.\n\nI'll preface this by saying that the order had been submitted 8 days prior, so we still had 2 days to complete the order per our policy. \n\nMe: (opening spiel) How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer: I am calling about my order. Why it's not finish yet?\n\nMe: I can certainly check on that for you. May I have your account or order number please?\n\nC: *provides info*\n\nMe: Yes sir, I see here that your order is on track to be completed within the next 2 days. \n\nC: No, that's not good enough. You do it now!\n\nMe: Well sir, I would be happy to submit an escalation request for a small fee - \n\nC: NO MORE FEES! You do it NOW!\n\nMe: Sir I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the delay, but this order is still within the standard time frame. \n\nC: You are a c***!\n\nMe: Sir, I am willing to help you resolve this matter, but I ask that you please keep the conversation professional. \n\nC: And I ask that you suck my balls, bitch! \n\nMe: Sir, if you refuse to keep the conversation professional, I will have to terminate the call. \n\nC: How about I terminate you, you fucking slut?! I hope your whole family dies and you have to watch!\n\nMe: Sir, there is no need for obscenities. If you need assistance, I must insist that you be respectful and professional.\n\nC: How about I fuck you in the ass, huh? Is that professional enough for you?!\n\nMe: Sir, I am terminating this call. If you still need assistance, please use our online chat tool, which is available 24/7 -\n\nC: I HOPE YOUR CHILDREN DIE AND YOU ARE RAPED YOU STUPID SLUT - *click*\n\nIn my 7 years working in call centers, I have never spoken to someone so rude. The COO of my company actually stopped by my desk later that day to make sure I was OK (my manager was listening the whole time). Apparently our legal team had contacted the customer's corporate office, and he was immediately fired. \n\nAt least there's some justice in the world. ",

Last night we received an email claiming the calculator application on our handset is giving an incorrect answer to the problem he saw on social media. \n\n6÷2(1+2).\n\n\"The calculator is coming with an answer of 9, instead of the correct answer of 1... \"\n\n\"This should be corrected. As a loyal customer I am disappointed. For such an expensive phone, you would think it could perform a simple function\".\n\nUsing all of my powers of high school math, I replied to the email with a detailed explanation of how to work out the problem. \n\nPEMDAS.\n\n**P**erenthesis, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision, **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction.\n\nPerenthesis: (1+2)=3, leaving us 6÷2(3) or 6÷2x3\n\nMultiplication and Division: (read left to right so division is first) 6÷2=3 so 3x3=9.\n\nThey were dividing the product of everything to the right of the division by the left, giving them 1. This is not correct as it would need to be written as '6÷(2(3))'.\n\nI explained that all our calculators are providing the correct answer and linked him to several articles on why 9 is the correct answer.\n\nThis morning I receive a reply.\n\n\"I am an engineer\".\n\nLord help us all.",
