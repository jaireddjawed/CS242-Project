I was looking for new school uniform with my mom, and we went to this shop in the not-so-nice part of town. When we asked for uniform for $school, they said,\n“Right away! Let me just get that for you.”\nAnd then they went into the back. All the other schools uniforms were on racks on the store.\n\nSo they came back with a huge pile of clothes, and I started trying them on. The first 3 were wayyy to small. I kept telling them and they said they’d get bigger sizes. Then they pulled this one:\n“So are you going into year 7?”\n\nAre you fucking kidding me? I’m 14, I get that I’m getting all new uniform but I hopefully look older than a year 7! I’m going into year 10! So they went into the back and got the right size stuff. I went into the tiny changing room to try on the trousers, and they accidentally got the completely wrong size and it wasn’t even the school I was going to!\n\nWhen they finally got the right pair, I mentioned, \n“Oh yeah, these fit a lot better.”\nSo the woman burst into the changing room (there weren’t any locks) while I had them halfway on! Like jeez lady, give me some time!\n\nNeedless to say, we aren’t going back to that store.",

I'm not into that kind of thing, but she had this really pretty antique broach that was going to look really cool in a French twist so she convinced me. I will admit, that evening my hair looked amazing. \n\nThe problem was obvious the next day. You see, my hair had been past my shoulders at that time, and the \"stylist\" who did the up-do couldn't fit one piece of hair into it. So she CUT. IT. OFF! Seriously, a 6\" long piece just snipped off when I was just supposed to get a style. I don't even know why she had scissors prepared. She told me it wouldn't be noticeable, well guess what? It freaking was obviously! It was right in the front beside my face. \n\nI went back to complain and they offered me a fix by another stylist for free. I figured that first girl was just an outlier and agreed. Nope! The second girl was super awkward and weird, laid her freaking boob on my face while washing my hair! Then started \"fixing\" my hair and trying to even it out. Made it so much worse, I looked like I'd been styled by a weed-eater. \n\nI actually tried another shop and they just honestly couldn't do anything with how much the first place screwed it up. By the time I started college it was down to 2\" long and spiky. It's taken the last 7 years to really and truly get it back how it was.",

But I figured it would work)\n\n&gt;C: We only have one kind of stamp.\n\n&gt;M: whatever you have. I just need some stamps. \n\n&gt;C: Ok.

Bear in mind, she was saying all of this with a very pleasant smile and demeanor. I wasn't quite sure what the problem was, so I tried a new tactic. Also, by this point she had already finished ringing up my two bottles of shower gel. \n\n&gt;M: Could I see them, just to make sure they're the right kind? (I've only ever get one kind from this store, so I'm sure that it'll be fine)\n\n&gt;C: Yes, but you'll have to pay for them first. Separately from these.

Recipe for disaster. \n\nIt was a Friday afternoon and my internet installer was due to be there any minute. When he showed up, he was way out of uniform. Hat turned around, big bulky chain necklaces, pants sagging nearly to his knees, gold grill in his mouth. I welcomed him in anyways, despite my discomfort. He did get right to work though, running cables and connecting the modem. \n\nAfter a time, he announced that he was finished, and did I have a laptop or tablet he could use to test the connection? Sure thing pal, here's my laptop. He sat me down on the floor with him so he could show me that it works. \n\nInstead of pulling up google, or his company website perhaps, this dude pulls up a porn site. The image in the front page was of a woman squatting in a thong with her fingers touching her butthole, I specifically remember. I quickly changed the subject and asked some question, and looked away from the screen. He chuckled and closed the window and packed up while he answered my questions. \n\nRight before he left, he asked if I would rate his service. I was so scared of him by this point, I would do anything to keep him happy and get him out. He handed me his phone with the customer satisfaction line, and he stood right in front of me while I answered the questions. I was afraid to give him any less than 4s or 5s while he was standing there with me, alone in my small apartment. I remember him giving me a shifty grin while he listened to his scores. \n\nI never followed up with the company. My mom said I needed to call back and report him to his managers, but for some reason I just never did. Maybe I didn't think I had a real reason to complain, because my internet worked. Maybe I convinced myself it wasn't a big deal. Maybe I was scared because he knew where I lived, and that I lived alone. Whatever it was, he got away with it. ",

        "text": "Hi TFC.  This week started off wonderful I returned from traveling and I was super excited to get some rest and recuperation.  Due to the restrictions of my job during the school year I must keep a professional appearance, however, as soon as summer hits and the last bell rings I make a beeline for the hair stylist to do something crazy.  This year I decided to try unicorn hair. For those unfamiliar unicorn hair is when you dye your hair multiple shades of pink, blue, and purple.  It was beautiful.  My hair was long about to the middle of my back and the color held beautifully.  I was extremely happy and received compliments constantly.  \n\nSounds wonderful, and it was, but just as summer is fading so was my hair and I started preparing to dye it back to a more professional shade.  As I began preparing I decided that I wanted to cut off a lot of the damage I inflicted with multiple bleaching and dying.  I scoured books, magazines, and the internet to find a fun and suitable haircut.  Finally, I found what I wanted and armed with pictures, snacks, and electronic babysitters for my hell spawn I set off to my favorite stylist.  \n\nHowever, while I was away gallivanting through the country the shop I frequented decided to move and will not be open for another three months.  Figuring it shouldn't be too difficult to copy a haircut from a picture I decided to try a different establishment.  If I had known what was about to take place I would have happily waited forever for the reopening.  \n\nI made an appointment and arrived on time the young lady seated me and I showed her the picture and described exactly what I wanted.  2 inches long on the back and leave the front long just cut off the dead ends.  Not too difficult.  So we begin as she is cutting the back it feels a little short but I can't see and I figure that it's probably because I'm used to long hair.  The stylist is talking and joking with me and the other stylists. My spawn are occupied and everything is right with the world.  How was I to know we had already taken a very bad detour?  She then takes a large chunk of my hair from the front and as she tells the other stylist something amusing she proceeds to cut it off above my ears.  Yes she cut over twelve inches of hair off. \n\nThis is where I speak up.  I'm upset and tell her that I didn't want it cut that short and the pictures obviously show long hair.  She stands there stunned for a moment and then asked what I wanted her to do.  Well obviously there isn't much we can do but continue.  She assures me that she can \"fix it\" and proceeds to cut.  After a very tense ten minutes she showed me her fix. Seriously, she gave me a bowl cut.  I looked like I stepped back into 1992. I was freaking out inside but keeping it in check.  I said I hated it and requested a manager.  They called the manager and I asked for a book. I looked and found a suitable cut that at least would be presentable.  I asked if someone else could cut it and do the cut I found.  The stylist begged me to let her fix it and assured me she could do it.  The other girl said she would oversee to make sure it was done right.  \n\nIt wasn't done right.  Instead she cut off too much hair the second time and was unable to fix it.  So now I'm there having come in with pictures, a full head of hair, and a great attitude and ended up with a boy cut.  Seriously, it's a man cut she even brought the hairline in the back up too high. There was nothing I could do. The owner and manager came in and I'm still being nice.  There isn't one person in the shop who can even look me in the eye. A mother who brought in her little girl for a haircut suddenly decided she just wanted her daughters hair braided and left. A male customer suddenly had an appointment and had to leave.  There isn't a soul in this entire place that wants to be anywhere near this nuclear explosion. \n\nThe management gets together and apologized and explained that my hair was too short for extensions or they would do them for free, and that there is literally no fix for this train wreck. They don't do coloring so they suggest I do a crazy color to make it look intended and give me free cuts and styles for six months until it grows out long enough for extensions or until we can fix it suitably.  \n\nThen today after washing it and drying it (only took two minutes to dry). I noticed that there were patches of hair that were not even and that my sideburns were two different lengths and shapes. I went to another stylist who told me I was pretty much SOL but she did even it out for free.  So now I'm seriously considering either wigs or headscarves.  Why?  Short hair isn't that bad it's just hair right?  Yes but it is cut so short that I now look like a man and twice today have been addressed as sir.  Yes, sir, apparently I look like I am transitioning.  Not that I'm in any way against those who are it's just not exactly the look I was going for. \n\nTL,DR : went in for a haircut and instead changed sexual orientation. ",

The cashier explained that the system won't allow the code to be punched in unless the entire total is $50. The woman ranted and raved and eventually decided that spending the time to return and repurchase all of her items would be worth getting the $10. Having worked retail for quite a few years, I could only imagine the internal struggle the cashier was having while not trying to show her irritation. But then it got worse.\n\nThe man immediately after return-o-rama lady was trying to return some OTC meds. As the cashier is opening the package to see how much is used, he explains he's allergic to them. Except, as the cashier points out, he took every single one of the pills. He immediately begins to argue, citing the \"customer satisfaction guarantee\" *(which I'm pretty sure doesn't apply when you've completely finished a 24 pack of something that you wouldn't take all at once...).* The cashier asks him to come back the next day to speak with a pharmacy manager, as she cannot do a return of this nature without them. He starts getting irate and arguing, at which point I step in and say \"hey listen, i'm sure you don't want her to get into trouble, so maybe just come back tomorrow.\" WELL. Apparently, he would know if she would get into trouble because Shoppers is owned by Loblaws and Loblaws doesn't have that rule, because he's done it there (which, to me, sets off scam alarms immediately). Eventually he packs up and leaves.\n\nI apologized to the cashier for having to deal with such rude people, and she told me not only was the store short-staffed, she was called in and was supposed to have today off.

        "text": "So this happened about two years ago, I was visiting Australia as an American for the first time ever, and my family and I went to visit this fun little chocolate museum, very cute, and of course, chocolate's always a plus. \n\nSo this museum had a prize program where they give you a wooden token when you first entered the museum and when you were ready to leave you could cash it in at the gift shop to get a free chocolate. Seems pretty simple. This is a transaction with NO ACTUAL MONEY INVOLVED, there's virtually nothing to get worked up about, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nSo I'm waiting in line to cash in the token, and it's the guy in front of me's turn to go. Let's call him SHB for \"shitty human being\" (Read all of his lines in a thick Australian accent.)\n\nCashier Lady: Here for the token prize? \n\nSHB: Yes, but my wife who's still roaming in the museum has the token. Can I just get the chocolate now and give you the token when she gets here? (Already, the dude presents himself as a Class A idiot. Why did you wait in the fucking line if you didn't have the token anyway???)\n\nCL: Uhm.. I don't think I can do that... (I'm pretty certain the cashier lady was new, she wasn't really sure what she could get away with yet and didn't want to test it.)\n\nInstantly SHB is preparing for war.\n\nSHB: Wait, so you're tellin' me that I can't get a *tiny little chocolate* because I don't have a *token?*\n\nCL: Sir, I'd be happy to give you the chocolate once your wife comes with the token.\n\nSHB: So, **WHAT** THEN, I GOTTA GO WAIT IN THIS LINE **AGAIN** JUST BECAUSE *YOU* WON'T GIVE ME A **FOCKIN CHOCOLATE????????**\n\nCashier Lady was shocked at this point and had visibly shrunk.\n\nBefore she could say anything, SHB was like, \"I've waited in the line, and I'd like my **goddamn** chocolate now please.\"\n\nAt this moment, an angel whisks her way in to save CL, and her name was Manager Lady.\n\nML: (flashes brilliant smile) So sorry about that sir, I'll get your chocolate right away.\n\nSHB: Well, you wouldn't need to be sorry if *she* (pointed glare) had just given me my **fockin chocolate** like I'd asked.\n\nML: I apologize, she's a bit of a rule follower. :)\nShe gives **2** chocolates to SHB, the sizes of which are no more than a quarter. Nothing worth having a huge screaming match over and pulling the attention of all the customers in the area over to.\n\nHe snatched the chocolate away and trundled off, muttering about horrible service.\n\nI tried to be as overly nice as possible to the staff when I got to ring up.\n\nTL;DR: Angry Australian man acts like the fish in the spongebob episode where they sell chocolate",

The breakfast at the hotel is very basic and really not that great, so we decided to go to a diner-style chain instead. \n\nThere are three of us, and while there was a bit of a line to be seated, the place was half-empty. We were seated by the kitchen, and our waitress came by a little bit later for our drink orders. Five minutes later we got our various hot drinks and waters. We needed a little time to figure out our breakfast orders, so she came back little later for them. \n\nNone of us ordered anything too difficult. Probably the weirdest request was an English muffin on my part. We passed the time discussing our plans for the day, and I came up with a bunch of reasons why creamer 'blooms' the way it does when you pour it into coffee when my sister asked. \n\nAbout forty minutes later, we had no food. The waitress had returned once to refill my sister's coffee, but that was it. The place was still pretty empty, and they didn't seem to be understaffed. I'm rarely hungry first thing in the morning, but my sister and mother were starving. Eventually we watched our waitress go into the kitchen and come back out without our food one final time, and decided to leave. We paid for the drinks, went back to the car, and got a local fast food restaurant's breakfast instead. \n\nI still don't understand why exactly it was taking the kitchen so long to come out with orders. We were close enough to hear that the little alarm for 'order up' was going off almost constantly, and could definitely hear more than a few people in the kitchen. There were at least three waitstaff out and about in their sections, which, as mentioned, were pretty deserted in an already small diner. When we left, our waitress didn't even seem surprised or sad. \n\nIt was pretty weird. ",

He had brought me along to do errands, one of which was to collect a prescription that had been called in the day before. I do not know if he was notified that the medication was ready, but after lunch, we headed to the pharmacy regardless.\n\nI stood shyly next to him as my dad spoke to the pharmacist waiting on customers. I remember him having the pharmacist look up his prescription and then leave briefly for what I assume to be a moment to look for the medication. Upon returning to the desk, my father was told that his prescription was not ready yet.\n\nNow, my father wasn't a terrible person but he wasn't always the most patient as a customer. So, upon hearing that his medication wouldn't be ready soon, he got really angry and decided to vent his frustration to the pharmacist. This wouldn't be very interesting, except he kept insisting the pharmacist was named Maurice...\n\nMy father: \"MY MEDICATION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE READY, MAURICE.\"\n\nNot Maurice: \"I apologize for the delay, but my name is not Maurice --\"\n\nMy father: \"MAURICE, I SPECIFICALLY NEEDED MY MEDICATION RIGHT NOW.\"\n\nNot Maurice: \"We will definitely have it filled by tomorrow, but my name is actually --\"\n\nMy father: \"I DID NOT COME OVER HERE JUST TO BE TOLD THAT MY MEDICINE WON'T BE READY UNTIL TOMORROW, MAURICE. FIX THIS NOW, MAURICE.\"\n\nThis continued back and forth and each time, my father kept calling him Maurice and each time, the pharmacist would insist that his name was not Maurice. \n\nEventually, my dad stormed off with me in tow. I don't remember if the situation was ever resolved, but on my father's behalf, I'd like to apologize to Not Maurice.\n\ntl;dr My father's prescription wasn't ready on time so, while screaming at the pharmacist, he also decided that the pharmacist's name was Maurice even though it was not.",

I collect action figures, so I walked inside intent to get myself a new Transformer. It's Saturday, so it's fairly busy with busy with families and their kids wandering around. \n\nAfter picking out something, I head to the register. There's only one open at the time, so the wait seems to be a bit longer than normal(the wait is never too long). An employee opens another register, and I head over to that one. \n\nAs I head over, an older couple quickly comes up behind me as I'm trying to pay.  They just had bingo supplies and seemed to just want pay and leave as soon as possible. As I'm at the register, one of my cards was declined (It's a shopping account I get only a little balance in). I apologized to the couple about the wait, and I get my other card to pay. \n\nAt this point, I'm waiting for the card reader to process the chip when I hear a long sigh from the woman behind me. The man then mumbled and grabbed his purchase. \n\n\"Thanks for cutting in line, you fat (insult aimed towards females).\" \n\nHe and the woman stormed off into the other line. I was taken aback, and I almost shouted something at them along the same lines. However, there was children afoot and I didn't want the parents looking at me like I was part of the problem. \n\nI pay and head out, while I was not so much made as I was tired. I work in customer service, and I already had at least a dozen people yell at me that week (we had an online banking changeover, many people were unhappy).  I do understand the couple's frustration, if only because I've been in line behind people who took their sweet,  *sweet time checking out. ",

        "text": "I was at my local Hellmart the other night for this one. This particular location is known for having a night-staff which is almost exclusively made up of non-English speaking people, in an area where English skills are desperately needed since most of us don't speak proper English to begin with. There are a few particular night unloaders that are crewed together, and their go-to answer when asked for help is \"We don't carry that anymore\" or \"It's over there\" (where \"there\" is across the store). They've done this to my family members a ton of times.\n\nI see them at the end of the aisle I'm in, and they're \"helping\" a customer. There's a lot of vague sentences (where you can tell they're just trying to get him to go away) and pointing, and they're pointing him to the far end of my aisle, where the Comet is. I hear him asking about ham, which definitely isn't in the cleaning section. He asks if they're sure, and they say they are, very enthusiastically (while packing up their pallet and forklift thing and really just getting ready to run). Customer looks very confused and semi-defeated. By the time he turns and approaches, they're full-speed leaving.\n\nI ask him if he needs some help - I don't work here but I am here every other day practically. I can probably figure out a good guesstimate of where you need to look.\n\nHe's looking for Lunchables for his kid. \n\nYou can literally see the Lunchables from where I'm standing in the aisle.\n\nHe asked for food for his kid and they sent him the opposite way, to the cleaning section specifically. I mean, probably not malicious? But goddamn, at least send him to the food section right behind you. I assume they know the words \"lunch break\" since they work and should know what it means so you could infer. These particular guys just tend to act like jerks. It's got to be intentional at this point.\n\nKeep in mind that many of the staff members are very lovely despite the language barrier. Several of them take ESL classes and either help you straight up (it helps if you can show them a photo or mime what you need), or will run down someone who can help. Most of them at least make an effort or seem sheepish that they can't help. These guys just seem to have stumbled upon an elaborate way to mess with people.",

I don't mind that the fish died because I know from personal experience that when we get hundreds in, a certain percentage are likely to die because of stress during shipping/whatever.

I politely explained that I don't mean to be difficult, but I'm not paying to exchange fish when I know we have a guaranteed time period in order to exchange dead animals. I was also only given a 5 cent return on a fish I know cost me more around $2.50, but at this point I was so exhausted from my own long work day and just wanted to get out of there. \n\nIt took me an hour and a half before I was able to leave when I was only really planning on a quick 10 minute trip. It took so long that they got a secondary cashier and people waited behind me for 15 minutes before realizing it'd be faster to move to the other register. It took so long that the manager told the person helping me out to turn their register light off.

I can't recall the reason, but whatever it was for, we ended up having to do or take care of pretty much immediately upon arrival. It  took a few hours, so we were finished around 10:30 pm, and we hadn't had anything to eat since breakfast. For whatever reason, most places to eat in the city were closed, and since we were going to drive home that night, we couldn't just grab something at a grocery store (most of which would be closed, anyway). To make matters worse, the GPS built into the car stopped working, my phone didn't have service there, and my dad didn't have a smartphone. \n\nBecause of all these things, we ended up driving around looking for open restaurants and fast food joints. Every place we found had already closed, or was in the process of closing. We finally found an open place (a chain mid-priced restaurant) and started to go in. By this point, it was about 10:58, and I noticed that the hours were till 11:00. I apologized to the host, and we turned around to walk out. Apparently we must've been wearing our weariness on our faces, because they said, \"No wait, we're still open!\" I asked \"Don't you close in 2 minutes?\" (I asked because sometimes places have hours painted on, but have different hours in different times like summer, or common vacation times, or the hours have changed, but they never updated the door.) They said that they do indeed close at 11:00, but they don't want to turn us away (I think they realized that most every other place was already closed in the area, and there weren't any other places to go). I said that it's fine, but they insisted that we eat there. Since we were tired and hungry, we gave in, and sat down to eat. \n\nThe waitress came to take our order, and we again apologized, and asked if they were sure they didn't want us to leave. She laughed, and said it had been a slow evening anyway, so she was glad for something to do. At some point with chit-chat while checking on us, she discovered what led to our eating circumstances. She was really understanding, and said that she was glad that they were able to get us fed after such a long and tiring day. Towards the end of the meal, she brought us a free dessert to split (one of those big brownie cakes topped with ice cream with a chocolate shell). \n\nWe made sure to leave a very good tip, for which the waitress was really happy. To this day, I've always liked that chain because of that small instance of kindness where they could have easily shut their doors to us, but instead welcomed us in. ",

Unfortunately, we arrived later than expected, and had to go to a 24hr fast food place to get a dinner. As soon as we arrived, the problems began. We were told by an employee to wait until a cashier assigned us seats. I initially thought that this of minimal consequence, but we ended up waiting for nearly an hour. The cashier then noticed us, apparently oblivious to our existence, was annoyed that we were still waiting and assigned us seats in what turned out to be a nearly completely empty restaurant. Thankfully, our server appeared to be prompt and attentive at first. However, this turned out to be a facade. She confused several items on our order, one of them being a swap between a [meats on skillet] and [large hamburger]. There was no relation between these to items on the menus at all, and there were hardly any other customers present, so we knew it wasn't an honest mistake. Still, we made the best of it, did not mention the incorrect orders, and ate our food with delight. After an lengthy interval of time, the server returned with some new food. It was our original correct food. My parents tried to explain that we ate to our fill already and that while the gesture was nice, that we would pay for what we were originally given, so the new food should be returned to the kitchen. After all, it was past midnight by this point and everyone involved was dead tired. The server condescendingly stated that she didn't care about the money involved and demanded that we simply eat what we were given. We were all so taken aback by this that we simply didn't say anything. We ate minimal portions from the correct orders, paid for what we were originally served with no tip and left. We did not make a complaint to management and have not been to this particular location since this debacle.",

        "text": "Friday evening, last minute movie tickets through a common savings site we shall refer to as \"Coupon\". They often have great deals on movie tickets, electronics, etc... \n\nApparently, they also save on their support staff because this happened. \n\n$me:who knows\n\n$ls:Lady Support\n\n\n[$ls] Issue: Each Coupon ticket only applied a 5 dollar discount towards the tickets.\nOrder #: 8675309\nDeal concerned: theater\n\n\n&gt; [$ls] Hi thank you for contacting Coupon Customer Support, my name is $ls, and I will be more than happy to help you with your concern!\n\n&gt; [$ls] Please, tell $me, how can I help you?\n\n&gt; [$me] Okay, so I recently just purchased two tickets for a Theatre at half off. When I placed the tickets on the website, it charged me an extra 5 dollars for each ticket, instead of just giving me the tickets as it should have. I was hoping I could have some help sorting this out.\n\n&gt; [$ls] You paid 5 per ticket and this deal is not eligible with other promotions.\n\n&gt; [$me] Yes, but the tickets are valued at 9.75, which is the cost of a ticket.\n\n&gt; [$me] I paid 5 dollars to get a ticket, but it only applied 5 dollars at purchase when it should have applied 9.75.\n\n&gt; [$ls] The fine print states that this voucher is not compatible with other prmotions.\n\n&gt; [$me] I understand that, but I'm not using it with any other promotions. I'm buying the tickets from you, Coupon, and using them on the intended website, Theatre. I'm not sure what you mean by other promotinos.\n\n&gt; [$ls] The price for the ticket is 5, and you purchased 2, then  you hadd  to pay 10 in total\n\n&gt; [$me] Okay, I don't think we're on the same page here. Let me try explaining it differently. \n\n&gt; [$me] Coupon is having a deal on movie tickets. Each ticket COST 5 dollars to me, the purchaser, however, each ticket is WORTH 9.75, to the movie theater. The deal is I SAVE 5 dollars for each ticket purchased. I indeed did purchase 2 movie tickets, that means I spent 10 dollars and saved 10 dollars since the total worth of the tickets is now around 20 dollars in value. \n\n&gt; [$me] This means that when I take those tickets to the theater and use them, I should get two tickets in return. HOWEVER, what happened was that when I used the tickets, the theater also charged me 10 dollars on top of what I already paid Coupon, making the deal worthless since I ended up paying the full 20 anyways.\n\n&gt; [$ls] The deal is that you pay 5, not getting 5 off.\n\n&gt; [$me] Ma'am. The tickets value are 10 dollars a piece if you purchase them at the theater. Coupon is selling them for 5 dollars each. I get a 10 dollar ticket for 5 dollars. That's definitely saving 5 dollars. I'm not sure what's so hard to understand. \n\n&gt; [$me] [URL I SENT GOES HERE]\n\n&gt; [$me] It even says it there under \"Choose from seven options\". 5 dollars for one movie ticket.\n\n&gt; [$ls] But what is your concern?\n\n&gt; [$me] My concern is that when I took these tickets to Theatre, they charged me another five dollars instead of just giving me the ticket as they should have. This is not a gift card or gift coupon mean to reduce the price, it is a promo ticket purchased at 5 dollars meant to COVER the entire ticket price.\n\n&gt; [$me] That's why it clearly says \"UP TO $9.75 VALUE\" right there in the options. \n\n&gt; [$ls] It says that you purchased 2 of them.\n\n&gt; [$ls] So the merchant charged you over thhose 5 usd?\n\n&gt; [$me] Yes, I purchased two 5 dollar tickets from you. That should have covered two tickets with the theater. However, the merchant charged another 10 dollars on top of the 10 dollars I paid you instead of just giving me the tickets as they should have. I've said this close to three times already. \n\n&gt; [$me] Look, can I just get a refund for the two tickets I purchased from you guys? They didn't work as they should have and I don't feel like trying to explain it to you for another ten minutes. Please. \n\n&gt; [$ls] I am going to escalate this issue, you are going to receive an answerin three business days via email. Do you have any other question so far?\n\n&gt; [$me] No. I want to speak to a manager. Give me a number I can call please. \n\n&gt; [$ls] If you’d prefer to speak with someone in person or would like to search the FAQ for an answer, please visit [URL GOES HERE]/customer_support.\n\n\ntl;dr: lady can't tell me that the tickets aren't valid after a certain time, so she instead has an aneurysm.\n\nYou can't make this shit up.

Someone didn't show, and she was stuck there until they did. \n\nAs I reached for a lid, the coffee slipped, and spilled everywhere. Of course, I was getting a large so it's quite a bit of hot coffee dripping and flowing under machines. Girl is obviously busy, so I rush to get napkins. I throw a handful on a puddle about to disappear under the slushie machine and hear, \"Don't worry hun I'll get that!\" I profusely apologize, I know it probably happens all the time but still. \n\nShe walks up and goes \"how the....?\". I explain it was a large coffee, slipped out of my hands. I feel horrible until she starts on the \"oh this is so much I dont have time to get it, guess I'll leave it for the next person.\"\n\nI offer to clean it. Seriously, it was my mess and I had no where to be. Nope, doesn't want me to clean it, just wants to bitch to me about how horrible it is while I check out. \n\nBy this time, gravity has done its deed and the coffee is under everything. I had stopped the biggest puddle, but not all of it, and it was getting in more weird cracks and crevices by the second. \n\nI'm the only one in the store, no one at the pumps, she's not on the phone and it's not ringing. So she's too busy bitching about it and ringing out my single coffee to clean it. I get she was probably tired and mad the next worker hadn't been in, so by all means leave it for them to deal with, just stop complaining about it to the person who spilled it and tried to clean it up for you. \n\nTL;DR- don't clean up your own mess, just listen to me bitch about it",

        "text": "So this starts approximately 4 months ago. My wife's google pixel needed work done to it and she was referred to a local car radio shop that also does cell phone repairs. They did an ok job fixing and didn't take long so we were decently happy with them. Now on to my tale\n\nMy Samsung S6 edge+ had a cracked screen. Been that way for quite some time and about 3 months ago my charger port stopped working and I couldn't charge it (I was then unaware of the wireless charging option), so I naturally took it to the local shop for them to fix.\n\nCame in and explained the issues I was having with charging and said I may as well get the screen repaired. They informed me they would have to order it and that the screen was going to be costly. I said no worries I was prepared for that. Due to my phone being dead and no way of charging it I just left it with them until the screen came in and all was well.\n\nA week goes by and I call and find they have my screen in but due to being busy it would be a day or two before they could fix it. No problem I can wait. \n\nNext Monday I ask my wife to call to get word on my phone. She responds back that the screen they ordered was the wrong one and didn't have a fingerprint reader. I responded with no worries I never use it so I can live with out it I guess, I just want my phone back. \n\nNext day I drive there and find that my phone is done and I can pick it up. They bring it out, say it has been charged so I power it up. Screen flickers weird and shorts out. Yup, defective screen. They apologize and say they will see what they can do. Annoying but understandable. They give me a cheapo loaner phone to use in the meantime\n\nThey have an issue with getting a refund back and trying to get a screen ordered from their provider and it takes 2 weeks before I get confirmation a new screen comes in. So once again I go by to get my phone. Everything looks great I finish paying up what was owed and leave. On my way to stuff I had to get done I called my wife to let her know I had my phone..... only to discover my mic didn't work. \n\nCalled them from another phone. Was told should be an easy fix and to bring it back the next day (they were about to close up at this point). Bring it back in and the guy who does the work tells me he has an extra part he can swap out but he can't find it. So I wait while he searches and even end up helping him search. 2 hours later he comes to the conclusion the other guy must have thrown it away. So I leave my stripped down phone with them to see what they can do. He also tells me worst case scenario he has the same phone and he will just swap out the screens. \n\nI come back next day or two to get the loaner phone again and to get my sim card out only to learn they have lost my sim card. I should have gotten out when I was there last but I was there for 2 hours waiting and left in a rush and I forgot. They hand me what they think is my card, I leave with it and loaner phone to get adapter for it that was at the house. Put it in only to discover it was not my card. Ended up having to wait a week for them to order me a replacement sim card.\n\nAnother week goes by and I keep hearing from them that they can't find a suitable screen to replace my screen with. Says they need to get one with charger attached and they just can't find it. I finally go in to the shop and tell them I'm so done with this and I want a refund. Am informed that they will only refund me money for parts and not labor which they say they only charged me for the first few hours and havnt charged me all the many many hours they have spent searching for a screen. Also say since they can't find a screen that no one else will likely either. Ok fine let's give this a day or two, and I tell them I'm going to call some other shops in the area see what they say.\n\n20 mins later I have an email link from another local shop with the correct screen info they gave me and I give them that info and they order. A week later and guess what... they get the wrong screen.\n\nThey send it back and instead of a refund get credit which the local shop owner isn't to happy about, finally gets in contact with the new provider and and they tell him that the serial number on my phone is wrong. So he orders what they recommend and gets that screen in. Finally after over 2 and a half months I got my phone back just friday. \n\nSorry for the long and probably (ok, ok, definitely) poorly written post. It has been a long and very frustrating experience and I just needed to get the facts out for y'all to see. In the end I did get to use a loaner phone, and they didn't charge me all that they supposedly could have. Just glad it's over. ",

        "text": "Not sure if this is the right subreddit, if not obliviate it.\n\nI had an appointment in  a very old office building. This place dates back to at least the 1950s, from the look of it. This was in the early 90s, pre-cell phones.\n\nThe elevator is old, small, and like the rest of the building just seems creaky and decrepit. I get in, slide the inner metal cage door closed, press the button. \n\nThe thing lurches to life, travels a few floors, and lurches to a stop between floors. Hit the buttons, nothing is happening. Fortunately, I'm not claustrophobic, and I wasn't in a hurry, so no big deal. \n\nThere's a phone handset. I pick it up, I can hear it dial, a chirpy lady answers, \"Well Known Elevator!\" \n\nI tell her I'm stuck in an elevator and calling from the handset. \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that sir. But we'll get a crew dispatched in a jiffy! You should see an inspection permit above the handset. Read me the permit number, please.\"\n\nI reel off the number. Hear typing. A pause. A rather long pause.\n\nNow-not-so-chirpy and sounding concerned: \"Oh, sir, I'm so sorry, we don't have the maintenance contract for that building any more.\"\n\nIt was probably only two seconds, if that, but I swear the ensuing silence seemed to stretch on for a long, long time.  \n\nThen I hear an enormous burst of laughter. Followed by, \"No matter how many times I do that, it just cracks me up every time.\" \n\nAnd I had a pretty good laugh too. \n\nNow I know what you're thinking, because I thought the same thing: \"she can't be doing this, she'd lose her job.\" \n \nI have no idea. Maybe she's worked there forever, maybe it's some locally owned franchise and she owns the place. I have no clue. \n\nBut, it really happened, and apparently she did it quite a lot. Maybe only with people who sounded calm, I don't know. But it was a pretty awesome joke, and worth the time I was stuck there (I think 20 or 25 minutes) just to have a great joke played on me. All these years later, and I'm giggling just thinking about it. \n\nWell played, elevator-phone-answering lady.\n",

        "text": "This isn't a terrible story, but I always aim to be extremely polite and easygoing as a customer and sometimes this leads to me either getting walked all over or feeling guilty for making fairly simple requests and/or advocating for myself. This story falls under the latter category.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I were in kind of a hurry for lunch, so we went to one of our favorite chains that we knew usually didn't take long to get in and out of. The first annoying thing was how long it was taking to seat us. There were several empty tables, but they were all dirty and/or covered with dishes, and the host/hostess is nowhere in sight. Fine, it's lunchtime, maybe they're just struggling to keep up. \n\n\nFinally we get someone who wipes a table down for us and sits us. This guy seems extremely frustrated and rants at us about his coworkers and how they don't know how to do their jobs and won't listen to him for a good couple of minutes (which I found to be unprofessional but politely listened, figuring he just needed to vent. To be fair, he had some good points). He talks for a while but eventually leaves us to figure out what we want.\n\n\nWe decide and a waitress takes our order. She gives me a bad vibe, as if she's simply tolerating my existence and is constantly on the edge of throwing down her apron and walking out. She leaves, our waters come pretty quickly, and then our food is out shortly afterwards. The lady who brings us our food is different than the one who took our orders, and she mentions something about still waiting on the shakes, so we figure they'll be out in a minute and start eating.\n\n\nWe finish our food and the shakes still haven't come out, and we need to leave. We decide we don't even want them anymore, because they're kind of big and it would take us too long to eat them now, we wouldn't be able to enjoy them if we were rushing to finish them, and we really only wanted them to have with our food to begin with. I try to get our waitress's attention to cancel them before they made them, but she pretends not to notice and walks right past me. A few minutes later she comes with our shakes, and I figure whatever let's just eat them. \n\n\nBut then we notice that they're completely melted, like they were made a while ago but no one brought them to us until now. Now I *really* didn't want it anymore, and I didn't want to pay for a glass of melted ice cream, so I more aggressively got the waitress's attention and explained the situation. She seemed obviously annoyed and I felt really guilty about causing problems, but my boyfriend assured me we were being reasonable and she just wasn't doing her job right. He's a server and he was explaining about how the server's job is to take care of their table and we have every right to speak up if we're unhappy about something. That may sound dumb that I needed to be told that, but it's really not in my nature to complain or do what I feel like is making someone else's job harder.\n\n\nAnyway, she ended up taking the shakes back and we got them taken off of the ticket.

The dr. told me that my hair would 'thin', but it's definitely done more than that.  I still have hair that I pull up into a clip, but I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to do that.  I'm standing up for my sister-in-law when she gets married later this month, and I decided that I might try and look for a wig to wear.\n\nMy husband and I went to the good wig store on the only day that I can go due to their weird hours, a Saturday.  (I say their hours are weird because they are only open from 10-4 weekdays and 10-2 on Saturdays.  I'm at work during their weekday hours, so Saturday was my only option.)  Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a kid person.  My husband and I are childfree, and while I don't hate kids, I'm not comfortable around them unless I really know them.  \n\nAnyway, we go in, and are promptly greeted by the salesperson.  She seemed nice, and I was looking forward to getting more information and to educate myself a bit about wigs.  I've never had a use for one before.  She was actually helping two other ladies, and once she finished with them, came over to help me.  I barely got two words out, when I was interrupted by a child asking her for something.  She told the child to go to the back and play their video game on her phone.  Of course, that didn't happen because the kid 'needed her to do it for him'.  I tried to just ignore the child and continue with my quest to get measured and try on wigs.  The child then decided to just hang out right by me and play with hair rollers.  And by play, I mean stack them up on the counter and bat them off with a brush he found.  Instead of correcting or redirecting the child to do something else, the salesperson/mother decided to also just mostly ignore the child.  This was going ok until I tried to ask questions.  The child just kept talking over me and the salesperson/mother so it was hard to really get the information I needed.  After he had hit me with something and touched me, I finally told her that children make me uncomfortable, and her excuse was that the father had something else to do today so she had to bring him.  Ummm no, you didn't.  You find a sitter.  So needless to say, I left with not much info and no wig.  Ugh!  It was so hard to go in there shopping for that anyway and she just made it even more difficult for me.  Some folks may say I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but it really ruined my shopping experience.  I don't think I'll go back, which is unfortunate since they are really the only store in the area.  I guess I'll have to try the internet.\n\ntl;dr Bringing your kids to work is NOT a good idea if you can't/won't keep them entertained!",

I can understand and respect how much that sucks, but I am one person who will be using this printer once every two weeks to print out my time sheets.  I don't need the $35 box of 5 reams of paper, and I don't need super fancy high-gloss advanced wipe-your-ass-for-you photo paper.

        "text": "Obligatory long-time lurker/first-time poster, such that I literally made this account for this story. This is a good customer experience, but it requires a *lot* of backstory before I can get around to explaining the title, and just how much this impacted my mom and me. I'll attempt to keep it concise but there was just so much that happened.\n\nImportant backstory: my father works in oil, and so we've lived in the Middle East for 75% of my life. We go back to the United States every summer for a five week repatriation. Rather than renting a car for an entire month, my mother bought a Suburban (henceforth to be known as 'the Missus') almost a decade ago, which we would keep with her parents during the year. My grandfather would regularly go out to start her and drive her around a little bit. However, my grandparents moved to a independent/assisted living facility last spring, and so my mother bought a parking space at a trailer/boat storage facility. The space has a roof and a back wall, and while the road to it is paved, it is a dirt floor. This is semi-important later. \n\nThis summer, my mother and I flew back to the States two weeks earlier than my father, as he only has so many vacation days and my grandparents needed to be moved to a full-time nursing home. We normally fly Qatar Airways to the States, but due to a [diplomatic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Qatar_diplomatic_crisis) we had to switch to a new airline. Depending on where you are in the Middle East and where you're going in the States, the long-haul leg of a trans-Atlantic flight can be up to about eighteen hours. Ours was a little less than that, but we had a flight to the hub airport prior, and my grandparents live about two hours away from the nearest international airport. All things considered, from the moment we step out of our house in the Middle East to the moment we check into our hotel in the States, we've been transiting for about forty hours. On long-haul flights like that, you're probably not going to sleep as much as you normally do. I got about seven hours, but the cabin was very noisy and my mom is a light sleeper, so she got less than half that. To add to it, there was a giant storm system brewing directly over the greater area of the city we flew into, and so our two-hour drive turned into a four-hour extravaganza of being paranoid that the weather itself was targeting us (I'm not kidding, there must have been three separate thunderstorms). By the time we got to the hotel, it was way past dark, and we just showered and crashed. As a final middle finger, however, the toilet in my mother's room wasn't working so she crashed with me. \n\nThe next morning we began our usual back-to-America errands: visit a fast food place our country of residence doesn't have, drop our passports in a safety deposit box, pick up the Missus, and drop off the rental. This last part was important, as if we didn't return the rental to a  local rental place within twenty-four hours of initially renting it (in this case, about 4:30 in the afternoon), we would have to pay for another day. We set out as early as our jetlag allowed, and ended up at the storage facility where my mother metaphorically wept with joy at the sight of her precious Suburban. We both knew the Missus would probably require a jump, and as my mother doesn't mess with car batteries and I just didn't know how to jump a car, we were ready to call the local branch of AAA. My mother got in, turned the key over, and... nothing. Not even a click. We called AAA.\n\nOur savior came hardly ten minutes later in a flatbed tow truck, gave the Missus a jump, and left us with instructions to call back if she wouldn't restart after running for a half hour. It was perhaps 10:30. We had plenty of time. Thirty minutes later, my mom got in the Missus and drove her around the storage facility before turning her off and trying to restart her. Again, not even  a click. We called AAA back, and the same guy came out again. He left the Missus connected to his tow truck for far longer than the last time, but after probably twenty minutes of sitting there with nothing but the headlights and a few clicks for his efforts, he called it. He mentioned it might have also been an issue with her starter as he loaded her onto his flatbed, and we were off up the road a few miles to a nearby auto repair shop.\n\nAs I said, the Missus is my mother's baby. As such, my mother was **very** not happy with the way things were going. However, the tow truck driver was very friendly, and kept us both calm even as we stood out in the heat and humidity. He asked about our country of residence, stared blankly at me after inquiring after my major of choice, and joked about being the only member of his family who could speak car fluently. We were both very appreciative of his efforts. He probably kept my mother from shutting down with all the stress.\n\nAt the auto repair shop, we went inside while the Missus was being offloaded. We waited anxiously while the man at the front, now to be called Bill, finished up with another customer. When he called us up, my mom explained our situation. The Missus happened to have been offloaded in a parking space visible from the front desk, and Bill took one look before turning to my mother in disbelief. You see, the Missus had accumulated a thick layer of dust and dirt from her extended stay at the storage facility. Bill was surprised my mother could call the car her baby with a straight face, with it in such a state. By now it was getting close to 1:00 and we weren't quite sure at the time when we needed to return the rental, my mother was getting to be a little panicked. She mentioned that the AAA guy thought it might be the starter as well, and that my father (who had been updated via text the entire time) recalled a similar problem stemming from the alternator in an old Suburban. Bill just said he would have his guys check all three. Then my mother said the very words that would ultimately make our day:\n\n&gt; I bet you a dime it's just the battery.\n\nBill's face lit up and he immediately started searching his pockets for a dime to match the one in my mother's hand. They both set their wagers down on the counter. My mother looked less stressed already. We spent a little more time talking to Bill as he inputted my mother's cell number and the car's information into their system. We spent some time laughing over our names: my mom and I both have uniquely spelled and pronounced names that sound very close to much more popular first names. My mom then mentioned our rental car dilemma. Bill announced that he'd put the car's information and repair order into an envelope that signified a customer waiting in the lobby; essentially, he'd just pushed us to rush order status. Already we were thinking *bless this man* but it wasn't even the end of it.\n\nWe still had enough time before we had to return the rental, so we went to visit my grandparents for a while. About an hour later we got a call from Bill. I couldn't hear his end of the line. However, I could hear my mother's replies:\n\n&gt; That dime is mine! Now, I want you to present it to me with a little pomp and circumstance, alright?\n\nThe problem was just a dead battery, as my mom had bet. But you guys knew this, I put a spoiler in the title. Laughing about being ten cents richer, we finally headed out to return the rental.\n\nWe drove out of town a short ways to the local rental return place, wrote down the mileage, walked in, and then realized we'd forgotten to fill it up as we should have. The rental still had about half a tank, and the place would charge us a dollar more per gallon if we didn't go fill it ourselves (on top of that, they'd charge us for a full tank). The bad mood my mother had lost while laughing with her new bud Bill returned. We had called a taxi to return us to the auto repair, and now we were running a little late for it. It almost bailed on us, but we just made it.\n\nWe returned to the auto repair with no more incidents. As the taxi pulled into the parking lot, I jumped a bit with the realization that I was staring out the windshield directly at the Missus, but hadn't recognized her. That thick layer of dirt Bill had been laughing at us about? Gone. He'd sent one of his guys to get her washed after the battery replacement. Looking at her baby, shiny and running as she should, my mother just about burst into tears. We went inside to thank Bill for washing her, and he presented my mother's winnings to her with a little jig, which had us laughing again. We paid and he printed the receipt, and we were on our way. \n\nThank you, AAA tow truck guy and Bill.\n\ntl;dr: traveled for forty hours overseas to move grandparents, situation piled on top of situation. AAA tow truck driver and auto repair guy fixed our car and our dampened spirits. also, my mom won a dime in a bet.",

        "text": "Hi all, short one but one that is just making me so frustrated still. I just got off chat support with a giant online retailer I'll call...Rainforest.   \nI ordered something Tuesday evening with 2-day shipping. I was walking the line of it arriving today or tomorrow, but as long as I had it before tomorrow night it was fine either way. Now I just got a notice that it should arrive next Monday. I got on the chat support quickly to ask what's up, and the woman I chatted with just kept answering things I wasn't asking. Telling me the expected arrival date (which I obviously knew, hence the problem), explaining 2-day shipping (I know what 2 days are), and finally launching into this big long justification for why it's going to take that long.   \nAccording to her, 2-day shipping only begins when shipped. Now that makes sense, except that according to her this means they can take as long as they want to process it and still be considered telling the truth. Everything I've ordered with 2-day shipping has arrived in 2-3 days depending on time of day ordered. This isn't a 3rd party thing, I bought it right from Rainforest. She says they can take 3 weeks to process something and mail it with 2-day shipping and no customer could possibly have a complaint about that.  \nNow I almost get where she's coming from, except that she was so rude and condescending like I was stupid for assuming it would arrive like normal and for daring to ask about it. She also \"explained\" in a very condescending way that I shouldn't purchase things that are sold out and then expect them in that window. Except the item wasn't, and isn't, sold out!   \nIt felt like total gaslighting as she answered things I wasn't asking, ignored questions I was, and basically acted like I was extremely stupid when I responded to her comments. Frustrating, and if this is how customer service is acting right now I can't imagine their big One Day Event is going to go very well.",

        "text": "Didn't happen to me personally but witnessed this happening this past weekend. I was in Daytona Beach for the July NASCAR race. Anyone who's ever tried to get a hotel that weekend in Daytona knows everything always sells out because Daytona Beach is a town that has a population of 60,000 and gets an influx 200,000 plus people a few times out of the year when there are events happening. All the hotels consistently sell out because they are pretty small since Daytona usually does not have that many people visiting all at once.\n\nBecause of the availability I usually have to get a bottom of the barrel hotel room usually a month in advance but no big deal. Whenever we go, literally the only thing we use the room for is to sleep. As I'm in line waiting to check in, I overhear that because of the crazy weekend, this guy working at the front desk is running on only a couple hours of sleep. I've worked holidays including Christmas before so I can relate. Ahead of me though was a middle aged bald guy who kept muttering under his breath about how slow the check in guy was. While the guy working the desk did seem really tired he was still moving quickly and getting everyone checked in with ease. So bald guy gets checked in and heads to his room.\n\nI get my hotel keys and proceed to head to my room. Well neither of the keys I was given, worked on the door. No big deal obviously there was a problem activating the keys. I get back to the front desk and I can immediately tell there are several others including bald guy who are having the same problem, as they are holding their keys in their hands.\n\nA couple of ladies were there first, and the guy at the front explained that the hotel's computer system is kind of old so when it gets an influx of checkins it can be slow to activate the keys. He explained that he could manually open their room with a hard key and the electronic one should work later. If it didn't, he explained that they could come to the front desk and he could go back and manually open it. The ladies seemed to be fine with this explanation as was I but bald guy wasn't having it.\nWhen the front desk guy got back from opening the ladies' room, bald guy immediately starts demanding for another room because of the key issue. Front desk guy explains that even if there was another room available (there wasn't, every hotel in the town was guaranteed no vacancy at this point) the key would still be slow to activate. Front desk guy tells bald guy that the key should work in 10-20 minutes and he could manually open it for now as he did for the ladies and eventually me.\n\nThis is when he started being a real dick. When bald guy was told there was literally no possible way to get a different room, he started personally attacking the front desk guy.\n\n\"This is why you work in this shitty hotel on a holiday because you're too incompetent to work a real job. I payed a lot of money for this room and the fact that my key won't work is unacceptable.\" At this point I can see front desk guy get that look on his face like he's about to snap from stress and this guy is the breaking point. He keeps his cool though, and says with a smirk \"If you want, I can cancel your reservation and refund you sir.\" Oooohhhh... you slick son of a bitch front desk guy. Bald guy is so steaming he does not consider his situation that he is in so he takes the bait. He gets his money back and storms out not before telling front desk guy that a monkey could do his job better.\n\nSo the front desk guy starts walking me to my room to open it apologizing the whole time for the inconvenience that the key won't work. The entire time I'm telling him don't worry about it, bald guy was a grade a douchebag. We share a laugh about how stupid he was to cancel his room.\nHe opens my room and I start unpacking. The blinds were closed but outside I start hearing people yell and boy oh boy does one of those voices sound familiar. I peak out my blinds and low and behold bald guy is standing by his car outside my room arguing with his wife because he just cancelled the only hotel room available in town. Keep in mind while they were arguing they are standing around their 4-6 pieces of giant luggage. It was literally outside so I can hear the wife saying things like, \"Why do you always lose your fucking temper!?\" Where the fuck are we going to stay!? You better go apologize and try to get our room back!\" I continue to watch and smile as bald guy got the reaming of his life from his wife. The last I saw, was bald guy angrily throwing his suitcases back in his car and driving off.\n\nAs we're waiting for the shuttle to go to the track I poke my head back into the reception area where front desk guy was and I told him about the prime verbal beatdown he just got from his own wife. He proceeds to start laughing his ass off and tells me bald guy actually came back not to apologize and ask nicely for his room back but literally demanded that he get his room back. Needless to say front desk guy told him that his old room had already been sold and he had received a receipt for his refund so there was nothing he could do. Oh by the way, my key ended up working 5 minutes after front desk guy opened our room.\n\nTLDR: Guy is an asshole because his key won't open his room. Angrily cancels his room in a town where every other hotel is sold out. Gets bitched out by his wife cause he cancelled only available hotel room in town. Tries to get room back, front desk tell him everything is sold out. Key ends up being a small issue that could have been resolved in 5 minutes.\nEdit: Spelling",

Lunch hour but not ridiculously busy, got our food pretty fast. \n\nNow we were using a debit card to pay. SO was driving and I was in the passenger seat. I pulled out the card and went to hand it to him, when the worker went to pass out or drinks. SO goes to pass them to me and grab the food, I set the card down. Before we knew it, we were driving away when I ask for the receipt. We don't have one because OH FUDGE WE NEVER PAYED! \n\nTurn around, SO parks and says he'll run in, has to switch a sandwich out anyway. (He's allergic to tomatoes, can't even just pull them off or he'll end up in the hosptial.) The rest of this is from his point of view. \n\nHe walks in, with the debit card and order receipt (not payment receipt) and waits in line. Starts out saying, \"Hey we somehow didn't end up paying for our food and we had a mixup with sandwiches.\" Guy ignored the money part, asks about the sandwich. Ok, SO is thinking he'd do the sandwich then the money. \n\nSO explains the tomato problem, dude says \"Can't you just pick it off?\" SO explains that no, he's not picky he's allergic. For whatever unknown reason, this guy just did not want to make another sandwich. Had to talk to a manager about it, who took it back and *with my SO obviously being able to see him* takes the tomato off and wraps it back up. SO debates eating it anyway but hates hospitals. Manager was told he was allergic. SO calls him out. Details get fuzzy here.\n\nNext thing I know SO is walking out. Couldn't switch out burgers, got frustrated and forgot about paying again. Bit of background, all the males in my SOs family have anger issues. They've all gotten therapy and gotten past it, but sometimes it pops up. Rather then explode, he decided to call a district manager to explain the situation. \n\nHe calls and explains, apparently they had called the cops so it was easy to explain who we were (that car that didn't pay). Luckily for us, the district manager pulled up the security video and saw the whole thing including the tomato incident. \n\nWe didn't have to pay, cops didn't come after us, and the three employees we talked to were \"dealt with\". Window guy didn't get in much trouble, he messed up but didn't try to hospitalize anyone, other two we're apparently fired. \n\nTL;DR- forgot to pay, tried to pay, drama with tomatoes, didn't get arrested.

        "text": "I just went to the Health Foods Grocery Store in the next town over this morning to get some fish and a few other goodies. I was trying a new recipe and it called for a very particular (and fairly pricey!) type of fish.\n\nAs an aside, I'd done a bit of research on this particular kind of fish (read: Googled it before I entered the store) and knew it was particularly dense but light and small portions would be surprisingly filling. This will be important later.\n\nAnyway, I went to the seafood counter at Health Foods and asked the person there for four cuts of fish. He was quite friendly and helpful and gave me four, very large cuts.\n\nWhen he went to weight the cuts, I noticed the price was particularly expensive, and asked if smaller portions would still be sufficient for four people or if they would be coming back for \"seconds.\"\n\nThe seafood guy agreed that smaller portions would be enough, but as he cut down the sizes he looked me dead in the eye and said, \"Y'know, I feel sorry for the fish. If people knew I was touching it they wouldn't want it anymore, and it would be sad that nobody would come to buy it.\"\n\nIn my head I was thinking that this guy had to be joking, but he was looking at me completely deadpan. Two snappy rejoinders went through my head at this point. \"First, you didn't actually touch it, you wrapped it up while wearing gloves. Second, if you really felt sorry for the fish, you wouldn't be serving it to me right now.\" I wasn't about to be guilt-tripped by a fish. But I didn't say anything, I just took the wrapped, smaller portions of fish, thanked him, and left for the checkout.\n\nAnyone else have some bizarre food service interactions like this? I'd love to hear 'em!",

We both ordered \"Fire Grilled Veggies,\" which cost $1.49 extra.\n\nWhen our food came, the grilled veggies were in their own little dish. My husband got an adequate serving, maybe half a cup plus herb butter on top. [Here's what I got](http://imgur.com/a/JwO0d).\n\nThis is exactly how it came. Four pieces of zucchini, no butter or anything. I paid *extra* for this! So when the server came to check on us, I said \"Is this all I'm supposed to get?\" and she said \"Uh...I guess.\" I pointed out that I'd paid *extra*, and come on, really? \n\nSo she apologized and said they'd bring me more and let the manager know also. They did bring another little dish, maybe twice as much, but we never saw the manager. The veggies actually weren't very good. They tasted strongly like lighter fluid or something, but I had to eat them after all that.\n\nWhen we got the [bill](http://imgur.com/a/H5W6C), we saw that they charged $2.99 for the new serving and comped it back off. Thanks I guess.\n\n",

So today I was behind a car in a drivethru getting my morning biscuit and coffee and I witnessed a type of rude customer that I had not previously witnessed. I hear the car in front of me at the window that takes payment arguing with the cashier. Well, I'm super nosey so I'm trying my best to eavesdrop but I can't make out what they are saying. I go to this restaurant every day so most of the cashiers know me and when I get up to the window, I ask what happened. Turns out the guy, who was driving a newish $40k SUV btw, didn't have enough cash for what he wanted. He wanted the cashier, who makes minimum wage, to cover the last $0.71. I know that's not a lot but this girl taking his money decided she wasn't paying it for the man who looked like he had a lot more to his name than she did. I don't blame her. Then he had the nerve to get mad at her for not giving him the rest of the money. He fussed and asked for his money back because he was \"going to another restaurant!\"  I've seen plenty of people get mad for plenty of reasons but I've never seen someone with that kind of money get mad at a cashier for not helping pay the bill.

        "text": "Wanted to post in /r/talesfromthefrontdesk but don’t know if \n\n1. This qualifies as a “front desk” story as it was at an airport gate. Actually don’t know what sub to post this to.\n\n2. Don’t know if subs like TFTFD, etc. are lenient towards customer posts. Thank god I found this sub.\n\nSo, story. This happened about a week and a half ago. I was traveling with my family taking connecting flights from (airport of city whose nickname rhymes with “Boater”) to a different state and then a foreign country and then going to a different country as the final destination. So 1 domestic flight, 2 international ones. We had 4 carry-ons and 8 big bags. Two of the carry-ons were small enough to go under the seats and the other two were a bit bigger, but they wouldn’t go under the seats easily.\n\nFor our domestic flight, we were boarding by groups, of course, with our group being Group 8. The FD assistant on the mic called out Group 7 to board first. As such, I assumed we were boarding next. \n\nNope. Cue insanely long wait as the FDA calls EVERY OTHER GROUP and then ours for boarding, in order of “7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8”. During their somewhat inept process, they announce that their overhead bins are full, and that any carry-ons will have to be checked. This is a **HUGE** issue. I’m traveling with my father, mother, and younger sister. My father and I both have laptops in our carry-on luggage that we intend on using in between flights (for work, general things, etc.) and getting these taken away would be really annoying for the both of us. The rest of the family has other things, but these are priority for us.\n\nI go up to the front desk and talk to them. There were about 3 people there, FDA (front desk assistant), OL (old lady), and EH (extra help). M will be, of course, *moi*, *yo*, or me. Whatever you prefer.\n\n&gt;M: I can’t have my carry-ons checked in, this is ridiculous.\n\n&gt;FDA: Sir, you have to get it checked in. There is no more space in the overhead bins, and if you want your luggage going with you you have to get it checked.\n\n&gt;M: My family has to take connecting flights, and I plan on working in between with what I have in my carry-on. I don’t want to have to wait until I get to (final destination) in order to access my carry-on luggage.\n\nAt this point, everyone else has boarded, save my family and a young lady who is also (I assume) taking connecting flights, and disputing this policy for similar reasons.\n\n&gt;M: You can’t find any extra space or anything? At least try to help.\n\n&gt;OL: Sir, you don’t understand. You have to get it checked in.\n\n&gt;M: Two of our bags are small enough, I don’t want to have to check them in.\n\n&gt;OL: *Continues repeating this line, interrupting whatever I try to say.*\n\nThe younger lady is in tears now, and EH has closed the doors to the plane.\n\n&gt;M: Ma’am, can you please listen? I don’t think-\n\n&gt;OL: **Sir, you don’t understa-**\n\n&gt;M: ***No, YOU don’t understand.*** I have been trying to tell you but you will not listen. Two of these bags will fit under the seats, could you not find any space for two reasonably-sized bags in the overheads? I have to take connecting flights, and I DO NOT want to have to wait to be able to access my baggage for my flights until the flights are done. It is ridiculous that you cannot try to accommodate something as simple as this. \n\n&gt;OL: There is no way you can fit those bags in any remaining space on the plane. \n\n(They were fairly small, not so small they would fit under, but still manageable.)\n\n&gt;OL: You will have to buy another plane ticket, and your luggage will reach its destination without you.\n\n&gt;M: I’m not buying 4 more plane tickets.\n\n&gt;OL: Then you can check in your bags.\n\nWhile this was going down, I saw EH quietly go through the doors, and a few minutes later, she came back saying that there was space. I thanked her as our family and the lady went in the craft, fit our bags in the bins, and got ready for a short flight.\n\nI hated that flight.\n\ntl;dr airline people try to force us to check-in bags we need for flight, old lady assistant denies us help while nicer staff goes to help and comes to our rescue",

The cashier was a very pleasant guy, but the bagger ignored me and was talking to her colleague the entire time I was at the checkout.\n\nI casually passed the bags to the bagger with a smile so she could begin bagging. No response. The cashier began scanning items and placing them on the conveyor down toward the bagger. She laughed to her friend as the items begin to pile up.\n\nI silently began to load up my stuff into one of the bags. The cashier, finished scanning my items, asked if I'd like a bag. This seemed to snap the bagger back to reality, and she said, \"Nah, he's got a bag. He's good.\" I had finished bagging my stuff at this point, so she looked around sheepishly as I left.\n\nAnyone else have this problem?

        "text": "Last week I visited a clothing thrift store with my SO. The store is relatively new, but is a franchise of a decent-sized chain of stores. We've been in a few times and it seems to staffed by mostly teenagers.\n\nLast weekend we pop in while in search of cheap shorts for summer. The store is geared toward teens/young adults, so they usually have name-brand stuff that's in good shape. From this type of store, I expect Top 40, or EDM or something along those lines to be playing in the background. Instead I noticed Pussycat Dolls' - Don't Cha was playing. Not exactly current, but I maybe it's just old enough to be considered 'retro' by teens.\n\nThe first N-bomb drops.\n\nHmm. They must have missed that it wasn't the radio-edit version? Not a big deal. I chuckled with the SO a bit, and kept shopping. Looked around the store, and the employees seemed unphased.\n\nNext song comes on. Immediately recognize DMX. Immediately hear a few dozen swear words/n-words. I don't think a radio-edit could even exist for Where The Hood At... it would have more dead air than music to cut out all the expletives. I catch eyes with my SO, then glance around store. Employees: not phased. Other customers: visibly shocked.\n\nAround that point I realized that there was no manager/owner in at the time. Just the teenagers. Obviously someone had their Spotify/iPod/whatever plugged in and didn't think anything of it.\n\nA woman shopping with her young kids, who was visibly irritated, asks an employee to change the song and points out her 5-6yo kids with a sweeping hand motion. The employee looks generally uninterested, but obliges and mumbles what I assume was an apology.\n\nWith malicious compliance unmatched by anyone outside of an 18yr old, she took the woman's request very literally and changed the song. Presumably by hitting 'Next' rather than finding a new playlist. Or maybe she just thought the woman meant her kids are sick of DMX because they listened to it in the van on the way over.\n\nNext up: Petey Pablo - Freek-a-Leek. If you aren't familiar, give it a Google (from your home PC... not at work). The song pretty much covers all the basic food groups of a song not appropriate to play in a work/retail setting: cursing, n-words and graphic sexual content.\n\nWoman with kids left, and we left shortly after.\n \nI initially didn't plan on saying anything, but today I sent an email to the franchise owner to let them know what went on while they were out. I have family that owns a few small franchises and know that they would want to know about something like this happening. It's just a job to the kids working there, but for the owner it's their livelihood and it would suck to have someone screwing up your reputation while you're out.",

        "text": "I hate it when stories are clear embellishments and skewed to the point there is no way it actually happened, This is 100% accurate and all quoted text is as verbatim as I can make it. This happened yesterday (Sunday) afternoon.\n\nWife, kids and I are killing time before a movie and decide to stop into a 'Texas' branded steakhouse an appetizer.\n\nWe've been to this place before and they have awesome fries, so we say - 'let's get some cheese fries and then we'll book it out of here'. We've been there before, cheese fries aren't on the menu but it's a plate of fries with melted cheese on it (1 plate fries, add chz, add bac).\n\n\n\n\"I know it's not on the menu so if it's not doable it's not a big deal, but could you maybe do cheese fries? Just a plate of fries with some shredded cheese and bacon?\"\n\nThe waiter, could not have looked more put out had he pulled out a post it and wrote 'you are really putting me out here...' says \"Naw... no. I don't think we can because we really only have so much cheese for all the other stuff that comes with cheese. I'll check with the kitchen\"\n\nComes back about 15 minutes later, asks \"Can I get you anything else? Would you like the check?\" - he's gotten us so far, exactly: Water and Silverware. We had asked for two beers and two lemonades.\n\n\"Can we get our drinks? Any word on the possibility of cheese fries?\"\n\n\"I'll get your drinks, sorry. I talked to the manager and the cheese fries, yeah, the fries take a really long time to cook so, like maybe 10 minutes, so naw. We can't make them.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about the drinks. We'll just go. Thanks anyway.\"\n\nHe produces the check. With the drinks we ordered but never got. \n\n\"Ok, we'll take the drinks then. Here's our card.\" \n\nHe shows up 10 minutes later with our receipt and the drinks. \n\nThis place probably sits 200 people. There were 8 servers standing around the entire time. It's not like they were slammed and this guy was in the weeds.\n\nThe wife was livid, but I was more in a state of awe at the sheer comedy of it, so I asked when he gave me the check booklet:\n\n \"I understand we were going off menu, but I wanted to make sure I understood correctly; you couldn't do the cheese fries because you would have to cook the fries which would take too long and then you couldn't put cheese on them even  if you could because you have the cheese portioned out for all the other stuff that comes with cheese?\"\n\n\"yeah, sorry\"\n\n\"What if I ordered a burger with fries?\"\n\n\"Those fries are already cooked\"\n\n\"I guess that makes sense, we couldn't have any of those because if someone ordered a burger there wouldn't be any fries.\"\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\nI get that he just didn't want to fuck with creating the ticket but jesus fucking christ I have never had someone be so blatantly 'I. Just. Do. Not. Give. A. Fuck. About. This. Table.' before. It was comedy gold. Pretty good little time.",

        "text": "We have a standalone bedstand. Oak. Looks pretty nice. Had it for years. And will keep it for as long as I can since I like it. And, as the tale will tell, because it was kind of tricky to get it.\n\nWe went to one of the larger furniture stores here in Sweden (no, not the huge four-letter one that is not even Swedish any more) that operate all the stores as a unified company instead of as a franchise, looking for a bed stand.\n\nAn hour earlier, I ordered a new bed in another store. I'm kind of tall, so even that bit was a hassle. They didn't have the kind of bedstand we wanted, which is why we ended up in the store the tale is about.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of browsing we actually found exactly what we wanted. Looked neat. Not more expensive than necessary.\n\nI spoke to a sales clerk about how I we were kind of not really to come her today and buy a bedstand, and would it be any kind of problem if I paid for the stand today and came around the day after and pick it up? (because, I would be passing by with a van and a small trailer the day after anyways) No, of course not. That happens all the time. Customers buy furniture, and come by sometime later the same week to pick them up.\n\nAlright. Good. I go pay for the stand, and explicitly say \"note that I pick it up tomorrow, Monday, about 15 minutes before closing.\" And she does exactly that. And informs me that tomorrow it's super important that I bring all the paperwork documenting what I'm about to pick up and that I've paid for it. She staples them together for extra clarity about the \"all the paperwork\"-bit. I nod, and we leave.\n\nCome tomorrow afternoon. I'm passing by. With a trailer. About 15 minutes before closing. I head to the warehouse and the delivery desk. I gently set down the paperwork on the desk and is met by only one person being there who responds with *\"Your order is not printed yet, let's see what it is you are picking up.\"*\n\nUhoh. When you come to a warehouse and intend to pick something up that was ordered the day before and they still don't have a clue what you want, then something is off.\n\nI told him my concern. Pointed at the date on my documents. Suggested that the printer should have produced that forklift order yesterday. That it...in fact, should have been done by now.\n\nI did mention that I was there 15 minutes before closing, right? You can't really complain about the customer service. Three guys helped me for 45 minutes, trying to find my bedstand.\n\nUnfortunately, all they did was try. They never found it.\n\nTheir last word of the day was \"Yeah. Well. We have been looking everywhere. Twice. It's simply not here. I make a note on your order that someone from sales are to call you tomorrow. I'm terribly sorry that this is the best I can offer. I am truly sorry. It's not here.\"\n\nNo-one called from sales that day. But...well. I was kind of busy with work anyway, so it wasn't much of an issue. When Friday came and I still had no call from them, I called myself.\n\nTurned out that the warehouse guy had indeed noted on my order that someone should call me, but forgot to flag the order so that sales looked at it. Still not that much of a problem. Like I said in the very beginning, I ordered a new bed too. I had no bed yet, so I wasn't really in need of my new bedstand. Yet. I told her as much. She still promised that she wasn't exactly proud of how they made me pay for something they didn't have in stock. And ordered a new one.\n\nExpected delivery? 4 weeks. Alright. That is still about a month before I get my new bed. That is seriously doable. I can live with that.\n\nBut, since I had tried to pick it up myself once already, and they made a mess out of that, I expected them to deliver it to me. She promised that I would have it delivered to my front door, free of charge.\n\nFast forward 7 weeks. Monday morning I get a phone call from the store where I bought the bed. They literally said that \"the truck is on it's way, your bed will be here ready to be delivered on Friday, probably sometime in the early afternoon.\"\n\nWhich of course got me thinking. Wasn't there something else I was missing? I had to think about it for a bit, and then it struck me. The bedstand. That I bought from another store. I had none. Where was it? Wasn't it an awful long time since I spoke to them? What the heck happened to my bedstand?\n\nSo, I called them again. Gently asking for a delivery date. Their response was *\"Well, this is a pickup order, so we are waiting for you to come pick it up.\"* and that...that is when I nearly lost it. I told the poor lady on the other end of the phone in no uncertain terms that...no, I did not intend to pick it up. Because you promised that you would deliver, to smooth over how it worked out last time I tried to pick it up myself.\n\nI think the reason that she agreed was that a lot of what I was suggesting was fully readable in the history of the order, just not correctly tagged on the header.\n\nWe agreed that Thursday was a good day to deliver my new bed stand, considering that I now also had a delivery date for my bed. The day after.\n\nCome Thursday, and I had a four-hour window when I had to be home and wait for the delivery truck. I saved up on a lot of boring paperwork and time reports all week, just so that I could do something useful while I waited. When the four-hour window had passed, I got a bit upset. Not immediately, but when it was overdue an hour. Thankfully, the store was still open, so I called them and...yeah. I have to admit. I was not even nearly polite. Not at all.\n\n15 minutes later there was a delivery company calling, saying that they had an express delivery for me, and asking for more specific directions. Ah the joys of living rurally. Not precisely \"turn by the three oaks to the right\"-rurally, but enough that the big city delivery guys get confused. I told him where to turn and where to start looking for a red house.\n\nI got out on my porch, looking for him. Saw him drive back and forth three or four times before he finally gave up and called me for directions. I literally waved at him and said on the phone \"I'm the one waving, just to your right\" and pointed at the only red house a mile in each direction.\n\nSince I had a muscular delivery guy coming to my place with something heavy, I suggested that he helped me get the boxes up the stairs too. So we went on and carried the boxes upstairs. When I got the two boxes I said thanks and tried to close the door, and was met with a *\"uhm, there are more boxes.\"*\n\n...\n\nSo. My bedstand. That was delivered in two boxes, was all of a sudden a 6 line delivery order.\n\nWtf.\n\nWe brought them all in.\n\nI thanked the delivery guy and went inside to look at my boxes.\n\nJay. Turned out that I got not one bedstand but *three*. As anyone with a king size bed knows, very few homes with two people in them have use for more than one bedstand for a king size.\n\nMildly upset about this, I begun assembling one bedstand. But...as it turned out, the packaging was damaged. And so was the bedstand. I had to open 5 of the 6 boxes to get enough pieces for one undamaged bedstand.\n\nAnd...you know, when you got two extra bedstands in your kitchen, in pieces, you don't really want a new bed the day after. But I surely wanted a new bed. Something had to be done.\n\nAnother call back to the store. Giving some poor woman in sales the whole story of how kind of everything went wrong with the order every possible step on the way, and then suggesting that tomorrow was the day when they came and picked up my two extra bedstands. They could delay it all they wanted, but tomorrow was the day when I would leave them outside in the rain. Any wish on their part to salvage value out of them would have to be taken action upon tomorrow.\n\nStrangely enough, two guys in a company van arrived as agreed upon a few minutes after 8 the next morning.",

        "text": "I live by a grocery store that I visit once or twice a week. They have an amazing bulk food section, including an area with spices, so you can pay $0.15 for the amount you need for a recipe instead of $6 for a whole jar. I love this store. \n\n\nThey have a self checkout area with six stands. Again, I visit at least once a week, and I tend to use the self checkout if it's a small enough trip. I'm quite familiar with the machines. Well, this time, I was restocking my spice rack and had about a dozen spices in bulk bags (less than like 1/8 cup each). I'm pretty quick with getting the numbers written on the ties put in the computer. So I start by typing in the number and move to place the bag on the scale. The computer voice instructs me to do this, as it always has, but before I could set it down, it names a price of something like $0.10. Ok, that was weird, but I bagged it. Moved onto the next spice, same thing happened. So I look toward the cashier manning the area, and wave at her (the stand doesn't have the ability to call for the cashier, at least not that I see). She voids the last spice from her computer, and doesn't come over. Try weighing again, same thing happens. I look to her again, she voids it from her spot. I try a third time, and it does the same thing. \n\n\nFinally, in a huffy, exasperated voice, she says, \"You have to put it on the scale, and then enter the code\", despite being told the opposite by the machine, and having used this machine several times before. So I did what she said, and it did work. But there was no sign/paper anywhere to indicate the machine was malfunctioning? She clearly knew it wasn't working as it should, though. Not to mention it took the third time for her to even offer a solution.",

But the stockers are awful! \n\nI used to work at this particular store when I was younger, and I guess maybe they decided that it takes 3 people to stock hair dye in a little tiny aisle now?? And they don't move out of your way, if you say excuse me, they think you just want to get by. You can't look at hair dye to decide which one you want, or make up, or anything in HBA without them ALWAYS being in the way and NOT moving!\n\nI am ranting here because calling the manager isn't going to change anything, no one who works there gives a crap about anything but getting the hell out.\n\nThanks for listening Reddit peeps!",

        "text": "So this happened a couple of years ago at the local cinema.\n  \nI was waiting in line to get some snacks and as usual it was taking ages. Whilst waiting in the queue I was deciding what to buy and also, as I had loads of time, I was working out the best (cheapest) way to buy them. They had various 'meal deal' options that all varied in price so I was working out exactly how much I should be charged.\n  \nSo I eventually get served and tell her exactly what meal deal I would like and also what other snacks I would like. So she rings it up but somehow it comes to more than I'd expected. I told her how much it should be and explained how I'd come to that total (which was correct). She looked at the big sign advertising the meal deals and said, \"Well, it's not very clear, it must have been designed by a man.\"\n  \nI honestly couldn't believe that she thought that was ok to say to me, a man. So I replied. And I'm not very proud of my reply and it's not something a honestly believe. But, If she thinks it's ok to insult men then I'm going to bat it right back at her. I replied, \"Yeah, maybe if he'd known that women would need to read it he'd have written it in crayons so they'd understand.\"\n  \nI think at this point she realised she probably shouldn't have said what she did. She didn't apologise but she was very sheepish for the rest of the transaction.",

I used to wear only clothes with cartoons on. (I still dress like that but its much more in now to do it. - on a side note it fits my proffession as an animator) \n\nSo anyways I had been to brand clothing store allot. It was more for older teens but I still went in because I loved the cartoon shirts. While I was browsing I noticed a mannequin wearing one of those hats that look like dog ears and have long sides that come into paw shaped gloves. (Think emo scene kids) I was in love! This was the first time ever I had seen something like this. (I know that they are everywhere today but they weren't back then) Obiviosly this was what I was going to get with my money. \n\nSo I look around the store and try to find a shelf with those on. Nothing. I know its for sale because it has a brand store price tag on. I call over a worker. She looks like shes in her early twenties. I ask her where I can find those hats. \"Oh thats the only one we have\" I ask her if I can look at it (im pretty short and need help to take it of a mannequin) She raises her eyebrow as if I had just asked her the strangest question in the world. \"Uuuuuh okay\" she smirks in a mocking way and tosses the hat towards me. Now at this point im thinking \"did I do something wrong\" I shrug it off amd just say \"I think im gonna buy this\" she just laughs. Oookaaay. \n\nI get to the counter and put down two shirts and my hat. The cashier is ringing them up. While the worker that helped me before says something to him in xhosa (a south african language that I don't understand) they laugh. Okaaaay lets just get through this. \n\nIm done paying at this point. He hands me a bag with my shirts saying \"here's your shirts\" he picks up the hat with his two fingers as if its something dirty and looks at me and says \"And here's your thing ...to uhhh look pretty\" him and his co-worker errupted in laughter while I booked it out of there. \n\nI didn't go shopping for clothes for the next year I felt so embarrassed about that hat. \n\nTo this day I still can't make out why they were laughing. Were they making fun of me? Was there something wrong with the hat? \n\n",

No problem, she says. \n\nSandwich arrives. Looks like wheat bread to me. I bite in to it, and - burning sensation.  Yup, they'd just flipped the bread over so the walnuts were on the inside. \n\nServer apologized profusely. I really wanted to speak to the cook, but they wouldn't bring him or her out. I was seriously tempted to storm in to the kitchen, but could foresee getting stabbed or arrested, two things I generally try to avoid. \n\nTo her credit, the server wanted to know what she could do to help, offered to comp my meal, etc. Rinsed my mouth out several times and told her there was no way I was eating in that place. \n\n",

        "text": "There's a bar near my college that I'd always tell my parents about because they'll have live music and have a huge craft beer selection. My parents finally come in and we go there on a Wednesday so it's not too busy, maybe three or four tables and a few guys at the bar. Our waiter comes up and introduces himself, we ask about the different beers and he confesses he doesn't know since it's his first week but he'll go ask, awesome! \n\nWe watch our waiter check on another table he seems very chummy with then head to the bar. When he gets there he grabs four shot glasses, pours the shots, and takes them back to the other table. We didn't think much of it (though there's only three customers at the table) until we watched him take a shot with them! They talk for a bit and he finally comes back with a beer menu, we order, and he goes to the bar to grab the beers and comes back with them, fastest he's done all night. \n\nWhen the waiter goes back to the bar he grabs a big, fancy looking bottle and starts walking back to the shot table but is stopped by a coworker who takes it and puts it back on the shelf. The guy kind of huffs and walks over to the table and the customers give him some shit then they walk outside to the side patio. \n\nOur beers were out and we waited to see if he'd come back or bring a check but after 40 minutes (the band was good) the waiter never returned! My dad finally goes up to the bar and tells the bartender we lost our waiter and had wanted another beer but we'd just take the bill, pay, and leave. The guy apologizes and looks us up only to find the waiter never put our orders in so we really could've just left! The bartender apologizes again and rings us up. When we get out to our car we can see the waiter still sitting on the patio smoking (looked like a blunt, not legal in this state) with his friends! Needless to say he got zero tip and hopefully got written up.\n\nTL;DR- waiter in his first week ditches his table to take shots and smoke with apparent friends, never even rings in the tab",

        "text": "So yesterday was Father's Day, and my family went out to eat at a restaurant we go to all the time. Seriously, probably 3 or 4 times a month. It's a cool place, half bar food, half higher end. My family is friends with the owners, my mom went to high school with him and my dad is in local government and helped him with the forms to start the business.   \nSo we had a reservation for 1:00 for my parents and I, my grandparents, and my aunt, uncle, and cousin. We get there about 5 til, and tell the waitress we had our reservation for 8 and our name. She looks panicked and says she'll clean a table for us right away. Okay not a problem, though kind of strange because we're looking around the multiple rooms and there are only 2 families in the whole place. Now I know some things could be reserved but there's no signs, half the tables are dirty, and there's really no indication the other tables were being saved. But whatever, it's fine we'll wait. Except she goes to the back and we don't see her for quite some time. No one is cleaning the table she pointed out and we're all just awkwardly standing around the entrance now. It was about 15 minutes before she comes out and clears the table and tells us we can sit down. So we sit at this empty table and then she starts bringing out all the place settings and things and setting up around us sitting. Strange, but again we love this place and figured they were just having a weird day.   \nSide note, we've had this waitress multiple times and there is a 50/50 chance that she will be really friendly and helpful, or will be one of the rudest and strangest people ever. It's odd but we always just figure it depends on the day she's having, and we always love the food anyway so it's not a big deal. I had also caught her attention before sitting and told her that I'd like it if she could separate out my grandfather's meal on a check just for me so I could pay for it for Father's day. She said it wouldn't be a problem and wrote it down.   \nWhile we'd been waiting my mom asked one of the bartenders whether it's a special menu for Father's Day or the usual, and she tells her that there's a brunch menu but also the regular menu we all know pretty well at this point. So we're sitting at the table and the waitress hands out brunch menus and my mom asks about regular lunch food because the bartender said that was an option. She stares at my mom for a second and turns right around and stomps off to the kitchen. Literally stomps like a temper tantrum. We all kind of side-eye one another and sit there perusing menus and waiting. Doesn't come back for about 6 minutes and we're all confused. Finally comes back and says the kitchen \"will allow it this time\". We're all confused and slightly uncomfortable as she's being super hostile.   \nShe takes drink orders and my aunt asks about their \"island mimosa\" because the description is vague and the waitress scoffs and rolls her eyes. We all just stared at her completely taken aback, because this is a 50 year old woman acting like a sullen teenager. She deigns to answer the question and we finish ordering drinks. Drinks come, we order dinner, all goes fine there.  \nFood starts arriving and everything is pretty much correct, my uncle gets an extra side he didn't order but she says he won't be charged so all good there. Then my meal comes and is completely and totally burned. It's a corned beef hash bowl and is completely blackened and swimming in a bowl of grease. I tried deciding if it was worth just dealing with, but my cousin said \"You're not really going to eat that are you?\" and I realized she was right. So I asked the waitress about it and she snatches it from me and stomps off again. Everyone else is eating and she comes back with a new version about 3 minutes later and it's great. Problem solved, thinking maybe things will look up now.   \nEnd of the meal and my mom asks for the check, she looks at me and I nodded at my grandfather to remind her of our conversation. She nods and walks off. She then comes back with 4 different checks. Apparently she took it upon herself to split up my parents on check 1, me and my grandfather on check 2, my grandmother by herself on check 3, and my aunt, uncle, and cousin on check 4. Okay, we usually work it out ourselves but fine I guess that's okay. My mom wanted to buy my dinner though, so I ask if I can just pay for my grandfather and have my meal on my parent's ticket. She says sure, takes my aunt's check and card, ignores my grandmother trying to hand over her check and card, and takes the other checks to the back. Comes back out and all the tickets are correct.  \nGreat, give her the cards in the check presenters and off she goes. Comes back and she has run my card for my grandfather's meal (correct) and my mom's card for her, my dad, and my grandmother (not correct), and my grandmother's card for...nothing. Thinks this is completely right and has done nothing wrong. I ask why she would take a card and not run it for anything at all, and also not clarify if she wasn't sure. She laughs and says she doesn't know what happened but this is for the best because now my mom bought my grandmother lunch. I say my grandmother intended to buy her own lunch and my mom didn't want/need to.    \nShe keeps laughing and tells me to calm down, and everything worked out for the best. She says the meal was great except for her \"one tiny mess up with the side dish\". She literally keeps telling us this is better and she did a great job. Like, the whole table is staring at her not speaking and she's telling us straight up what a great job she did with us. I was livid, we sign the checks, I left no tip and neither did my mom. I walked to the other room with my dad because I didn't want to make a scene or confront her.   \nShe ends up following me and telling me \"Everything worked out for the best, your mom bought your gram lunch. They seem happy about it, this was meant to be. Etc\". I finally just said to her \"You screwed up, do you get that? You messed up and they're too polite to say anything about it. You're laughing and joking about your screw-up like we're all supposed to be okay with it. You were completely irresponsible with people's money and you don't even have the courtesy to apologize or care. Do you seriously think you did well today? You really consider this a success?\" and then I turned and left. I never raised my voice but I knew I needed to leave before I made a scene. Apparently after I walked out she turned to my dad and said \"Is she always so rude?\" and he just shook his head and followed me.   \nI inherited my father's temper, so the fact that we both left so calmly makes me really proud of both of us. It was a really awful experience and still makes me upset today. I know we'll keep going there like always, but I will definitely ask for another server after this. The other times, I figured were just bad days. But this was willful ignorance and intentional rudeness. I haven't yet decided whether I'll mention this to the owner next time he comes to one of our picnics.",

I get that some people have chronic illnesses, but she doesn't try to use a handkerchief or cover it in any way, just **HACK HACK HACK** all over everything... there are spit drops left afterwards on every surface this lady goes near that the baristas then have to wipe up. I dislike this lady so much my stomach twists from just seeing her on the street. I almost always dealt with her at the register because I have a mean poker face and the patience of a saint.\n\nAnyway.\n\n\"I have a cold brew for iwrestledasharkonce!\" my former co-worker called out.\n\n\"Is that mine?\" she asked, reaching for it. It had my name on it. The barista said my name. Seriously?\n\n\"No, that's mine,\" I said, swiping it up before she can cough all over it.\n\n(disgusted grunt) \"Wait, you used to work here.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\nShe then noticed my grocery bag on the floor. \"Is there an ANIMAL IN THERE?!\" she shouted at the baristas on the other side of the counter. You know, in a \"Look at this, kick her out!\" sort of way. **HACK HACK HACK.**\n\nI could have told her it was none of her business, but I was feeling a little green at the gills from her still managing to sputter on my coffee. So instead I thought about it. The chicken breasts. The fish filets. The slices of corned beef. Technically...\n\n\"Why yes. I've got quite a few in here, actually! They're all dead! Someone chopped them into little bits for me! I'm bringing them home to eat and I can't wait!\" I smiled pleasantly.\n\nIt worked. She looked totally grossed out. \"Eugh, that's very rude!\"\n\nI just smiled, shrugged, grabbed a new straw, and left.\n\nGlad I could disgust you just a little bit as much as you disgusted me and all my coworkers :)",

I got some peanuts Oreos, general stuff. Now at the counter I was going to get dome loose candy. I grabbed some gummy bears and gum and \"peanut m&amp;ms\" Now these were not peanut m&amp;ms. They were stwarberry m&amp;ms, who h I pi ked do to the similar cover art. So when I got to checkout I was supposedley ready. She started bagging everything when she said \"Just a heads up, those are strawberry m&amp;ms. I responded with \"Oh, thanks\" and swapped them out. \n\nTldr; Stawberry m&amp;ms exist. ",
