Tax collectors tarred and feathered. High anti royalist sentiment. William Cotillion, King George's personal advisor to the colonies has to get out of here as soon as possible to let him know. William goes out under cover of darkness, having to sleep under the stars, just barely reaching the eastern port in time to board a ship to England. Aye, but everyone there knows who he is once he gives his name for the ship manifest! Willy, the rotten stinking Brit, gets pelted with tomatoes and eggs before he even gets on board. He feels miserable. Georgie ought to know about this, too - get him to stop produce imports into New York, out of spite. The rest of the trip across the Atlantic is grueling and tough. Finally they reach the port of London. Will is absolutely exhausted. He barely has time to make himself presentable. He runs right into Buckingham palace, knocks on the door, and so tired and out of breath, he can only sputter out single syllables when the King arrives to greet him:\n\nMy liege! We've been trying to reach you about York Har.'s eggs, then the war on tea",
