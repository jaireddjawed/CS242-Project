I have seen apps that allow you to change the input method (from text-based to speech-based, for example), but I'm not completely sure if it can be done for something like a switch.\nThis is for apps by brands like Fischer Price that allow children to click on characters and objects to progress through a story. Some children, due to physical limitations, are not able to do this and require things like switches to allow them to interact with the app. (that's a super sloppy description, but I can go into detail if needed)\nAlso, as far as switches go, I was thinking of using something like a toggle switch!\nAny comments or suggestions about what I can do to make this work or if I should give up on it are welcome!",

I will try to explain the example.\n\nSuppose I have the alphabet `A={a,b,c,d}` and suppose I want to create a grammar which defines the language `L={w : w is in A^4 and w contains each symbol of A only once}`, thus forming the set of words `{abcd, bacd, cabd, ...}`(the cardinality is finite).\n\nNow, I can't really create such grammar. I mean, naively I could have a set of production rules which could straightforwardly generate all of the possible strings. However, I'd like looking for a more elegant and succinct way while still using a grammar.\n\nMy idea is to have a production rule such as `P -&gt; xT` where `x` means \"select a terminal symbol from A which has not been already used in any of the production rules\" and `T` is a nonterminal symbol. However, this seems not being covered by the expressiveness of a grammar, but I'm not sure of that.\n\nDo you have any insights (I hope my explanation was clear :P)?\n\nEdit: typos.",

Each update takes about twice as long to find because theres half the possible values left which are smaller.\n\nImagine such a var at each index 0..infinity. proofOfWorkAt0 is defined as infinity. proofOfWork at i is the highest proofOfWork known at i thats lessThan such proofOfWork at i-1, so pow0 &gt; pow1 &gt; pow2... Now we can update pow2 more times since as it approaches the last known proofOfWork(pow1), proofOfWork(pow1) may rise or not, so theres more room for expansion in pow2, but pow2 doesnt get it all at once, and you dont know which number to approach so precomputing them before knowing the others gets very expensive, while updating them after the others are known is much cheaper, which motivates copying the dependencies across the network. But there are problems.\n\nSince anyone can create and broadcast proofOfWorks for any of the vars, we cant choose the order of updates, only the statistics of how hard it is to update them, given the known proofOfWorks.\n\nA proofOfWork for a var can rise but never fall. It may be higher than someone knows, but they would only accept an update that proves its at least some value.\n\nSince such an array of proofOfWorks has a branchingFactor of 1, what if we expanded it to a var can have 2 parents, and its max allowed proofOfWork depends on some function of them such as min of the current proofOfWorks of both parents? Or sqrt of multiply (exponential median) of the 2 parents?\n\nOr a var with 3 parents and 1 constant: My value is proofOfWork(varA)&lt;const?proofOfWork(varB):proofOfWork(varC). But that var is not a proofOfWork var since its value can fall.\n\nWhat function would create a kind of proofOfWork based var that can be written at least a million times instead of log?",

It goes as follows:\n\n * Consider an array of size N which represents blocks you can walk on.\n\n * On the blocks there are timers, that set off bombs on the block when they reach zero and reset themselves (So a bomb of timer 3, will explode after 3 seconds, 6 seconds, 9 seconds..).\n\n * Every move you make takes exactly 1 second.\n\n * The timer can be anything between 2 and 5 (-1 is an exception, which means no bomb is present).\n\n * You can walk on the blocks with jumps of 1,2 or 3 blocks. \n\n\nSo for instance, consider the array:\n[2,-1,2,3,4,2] (-1 means no bomb is on the block).\nYou start on the 0 index (1st block), you can reach the last block by jumping as follows:\n1. a jump of 3\n2. a jump of 1\n3. another jump of 1\nNotice you cannot do a jump of 3 and then a jump of 2, because the timer of the bomb will set, and you will explode.\nYou also cannot do a jump of 2, then 1, then 1, then 1. Because the timer of the last block, which sets every 2 seconds, will explode.\nAll of the options for the following configuration are:\n1. 1,2,2\n2. 1,3,1\n3. 2,1,2\n4. 2,2,1\n5. 3,1,1\n\nSo a total of 5 ways.\nThe question is, given N between 1&lt;N&lt;100000, and the bombs configuration (for which the timer can be between 2 and 5 seconds, with the -1 exception) in how many ways can you get to the last block?\n\nThe naive solution would be ofcourse to check recursively if index+1/index+2/index+3 timers are 1, and call the functions for the indices that aren't 1. If we reached the end, we add 1 to the variable summing the different ways. Ofcourse this would take 3^n time complexity, so that's no good.\nI tried to optimize it with dynamic programming, because ofcourse, if for example I'm on the third block, and I've already been there on my 2nd turn (perhaps I jumped 1 then 2, and now I did 2 then 1), then that's exactly the same, and I don't need to check that aswell. I can also do that for modulu 60 of that turn (because that's the smallest common divisor for 2,3,4,5). But I think I can make this even better. I just don't know how.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I am 26, turning 27 soon I work Full Time 48+ hours a week as a mechanic. I want to go back to school for Computer Science since this is something I've always wanted to pursue. \n\nHere is the problem I can't go in to school since my work schedule (I've looked in to it) and I can't go to school online with a local Community College ( long story ) and since I have my G.E.D. I cant go straight into a public university. \n\nSo here's #1.) what school is the best bet online for CS that will actually be a decent school that employers will not laugh at. I want a decent well rounded education that will get me a good chance at getting a decent job after college. I also want to make sure I'm not going to absolutely pay out the ass for the education either.\n2.) What advice do you guys have for a 27 year old going back to school for a CS degree. Is it even worth it at this age? are employers going to want a 31 year old fresh out of school with no experience?  ",

For example, if I log into my email on my phone, I get that they can see a request to connect to my email, but can they see the content of the messages I pull up, or the content of documents stored in the cloud?

I'm hoping your answers can help me decide if I should take a break from my career and go back to school.  Any answers you can provide would be extremely helpful. Also, if you don’t mind adding some context, please include your year of graduation or class level (fresh, soph, grad, etc.) if you are currently a student.\n\n\n\nWhat is the general atmosphere of the program? Are people collaborative and outgoing or is it more dry and cut-throat?\n\n\nHow is the work load / life balance for the average student?\n\n\nHow diverse is the student population within the program?\n\n\nWhat are the professors like? Are they accommodating and helpful, or are they just there for the paycheck?\n\n\nWhat types of programs do students make? Is the content of the curriculum focused on a particular area?\n\n\nHow is UMass’s COMP SCI program unique when compared to other schools?\n\n\nWhat do you like most about studying COMP SCI at UMass?\n\n\nWhat do you like least about studying COMP SCI at UMass?\n\n\nAre you considering transferring to another school’s COMP SCI program? Why?\n\n\nAre there any other blatantly obvious factors that contribute to quality of life for COMP SCI majors (which would be specific to UMass and that one would otherwise have no knowledge of unless they were a student in the program) that I haven’t addressed here? For example, the FAC is like a dungeon and this plays a big factor into the lives of students who study there (I can attest).\n\n\nThank you so much. All of your help is appreciated tremendously.",

Topics covered include the tasks performed by a system administrator.
