I made a point that I felt like our friendship was unfair and that my boundaries had been disrespected. I also highlighted her constant negativity and of course, her obsession for this celebrity.\n\nI was trying to be kind about things. I told her she needs to get help because she clearly has some issues. She skipped over the celebrity obsession in one paragraph, where she admits she has an unhealthy attachment and says the way she has shared things with me makes it out to be far bigger than it actually is. I strongly disagreed with her on that and she avoided that topic again.\n\nInstead she turned the blame of me for not being open and communicating enough and it's my fault my boundaries were not set in place better. That's partly correct, but in my defense, I didn't feel comfortable discussing them because I had a feeling she'd make me guilty for setting them.\n\nMaybe I'm just wired different because I assume that if someone goes quiet for a day or two, that generally gives me the idea that they want some space.\n\nI don't ask for much from her and I just wanted her to see it from my perspective I guess. I wasn't going to message her but I'm not the kind of person who will block and ghost, stupidly wishing I had taken advice from original post and done exactly that. I'm a dumbass!\n\nShe has said that she hopes I haven't been offended and hurt by things that **I've** taken the wrong way, not accepting the fact that some of the things she has said genuine were hurtful.\n\nShe has summed it up like this:\n\n*So yeah, I have things to watch out for, but so do you. Try to be better at letting people in so that you can have a chance at making real connections and history doesn't repeat itself.*\n\nI asked her to respect my boundaries and not message me again and she has then sent me a document with 2.5k words repeating herself and trying to highlight me as the main problem. And then another two massive paragraphs this morning.\n\nMoral of the story, if you have a friend like this, just walk away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : UPDATE: I tried to be honest and tell her how I feel and the blame was thrown back at me. Moral of the story, if you have a friend like this, just walk away.",

        "text": "So two years ago I cheated on my bf. We were technically broken up at the time it happened, but since I was talking to the guy while we were still together it was cheating. Shortly after it happened, I felt horrible and told my bf. He was very upset, but we got back together and things were okay for a little while.\n\nFast forward two years and we haven’t had sex in a year. Before that it was 6 months. Now, I don’t need sex all the time, but it’s still super important to me and going a year without really sucks. I know I messed up by cheating and betraying his trust so I gave him time and hoped eventually things would naturally get better. Since they never did and it’s now been a year, I told him we need to have a talk about it. He started crying and told me he still felt betrayed by me and didn’t know what to do about the no sex issue. Since I’m the guilty one, I didn’t want to push him so we dropped topic.\n\nMy question is what should I do? I’m stuck in a sexless relationship, that I don’t want to end because I love him and I can’t get mad because it’s my fault. Is our sex life just doomed now?\n\nTL;DR! - I cheated on my bf two years ago and now he doesn't want to have sex with me. What to do?",

        "text": "My girlfriend (23F) and I (23M) have been living together for nearly a year now, this year it will be 5 years together. Before living together we had a pretty solid relationship, only fighting occasionally but reconciling well. Ever since moving in together we fight non stop, whether it be about the dishes, cleaning or just a simple disagreement  but when she gets angry I become the worst person in the world and get yelled at and put down. I'm by no means a perfect person, but I see myself as very calm and I don't always understand where the anger comes from.\n\nThe biggest problem in our relationship has always been weed, I enjoy smoking and have since way before I met her. I don't care that she doesn't smoke and I even realize that it was getting out of hand and I wasn't being a very attentive partner so we decided to compromise. I can only smoke 3 days a week now and only when we're not spending time together, whatever that's something I can live with. The problem is that there is no sort of wiggle room with this. I went to a concert with my friend a couple weeks ago and smoked with him so apparently I get in trouble for smoking 4 days of the week instead of 3. She phrases it as if I'm \"choosing a substance over her\". She has recently asked me to basically stop drinking and she says I can only have 2 beers on the weekend, I objected and told her I don't want to follow that rigid rule but apparently I'm being disrespectful to her if I don't. I'm by no means an alcoholic and weed and alcohol no way effects my work or my day to day life (outside of this relationship). I even made the effort to stop drinking during the week for myself not for her but I don't see anything wrong with enjoying a few beers on the weekends.\n\nI love my girlfriend and I think she's a good person but the anger is really getting out of control, she'll personally attack me and put me down when she's angry. She knows at this point I'm not going to just follow her every wish because I do try to set boundaries, but that's sometimes responded to with passive aggressiveness until it explodes in my face. There are so many other examples of things other than weed or drinking that she'll get really mad at me about but I'm starting to get really frustrated with how much it feels like she is trying to control my life. \n\nI understand not wanting to be around weed and not wanting a partner that's always high but I really worry this \"compromise\" will continue to get out of hand. I worry she's always going to feel like \"I'm choosing substances over her\". I don't really want a life where everything is so rigid and I don't want to have to ask for permission everytime I want to smoke or have a beer. \n\nI know I'm still young, she's my first real girlfriend and things were very different when we had our seperate lives in university. I just don't know what to do from here.\n\nTLDR: I'm tired of compromising with my girlfriend and constantly feeling bad for doing things that I like to do.",

        "text": " TL/DR: A coworker (22M) called me (22F) after hanging out with a group from work and confessed feelings, even though he has a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend. I'm upset because he put me in an awkward position and this seems to happen every time I make guy friends. I don't know how to handle this situation. Please read the whole text before commenting because I'm afraid to sound stuck-up, but I'm genuinely upset.\n\nI started working somewhere a month ago, and I met some friends here, and it made work genuinely fun. A group of 2 girls and 3 guys, all in our early twenties. I went out with them yesterday and it was great. I even told them some personal things. I really love that group.\n\nThen afterwards one of the guys called me and confessed he is into me. Now, that isn't a bad thing but he has a girlfriend and apparently lied to her about what group he went out with. I feel so sorry for the girl, and I will pressure him to tell her because she doesn’t deserve this stuff and she deserves a better boyfriend. It is also weird: I have literally had like 5 conversations with this guy in total. I don't get it.\n\nI have a boyfriend too, and he knows that. I even told my new friends how much my boyfriend means to me and how he helped me out of my depression. I just don’t understand why he would do this to his girlfriend, and put me in that position too, especially after what I told them about my boyfriend. Like seriously, what did he expect me to say?\n\nI'm disappointed and it is a pattern. This is not the first time this happens. Almost every guy friend I make hits on me after a month or so. I know so many guys that are great and I want to be friends with them. It just seems to happen every single time. Even when I think it won't. It makes me feel like I’ll never be a person to a guy. I’m not a person, I’m a girl. I’m either sexually or romantically interesting, or I’m not interesting at all, and I hate it. I just want to get to know people and talk to them without other intentions. I stopped making one on one guy friends, because they seem to take it the wrong way when I am friendly and I don't want to lead someone on or be mean. But I thought making friends in a group would be different.\n\nSo because of this I lost another friend group. I'm young and I don't know how to handle this correctly. I can't just keep hanging out with this group now. I feel like that won't be right to my partner. But I want to be friends with the others. I had a great time. But that means I'll have to be around him too, and I don't want to. I told the other girl in the group, mostly to warn her in case he is suddenly in love with her too. I did not tell the other guys.\n\nBefore this all happened, he invited all of us to do something together again next week. But after I rejected him I got uninvited.\n\nShould I withdraw from the whole group? Or is there a way I can keep being friends with the others? Maybe someone has had a similar experience? I don't want him to lose the friend group either, even though it is clearly him that is messing stuff up.\n\n(Just want to make sure I'm understood: I'm not upset that he has feelings for me. He can't control his feelings. I'm upset he lied to his girlfriend, I'm upset he confessed feelings to me and put me into this position even though he knows how much I love my partner. I'm upset I'm losing my new friend group and I'm not invited anymore. And I'm mostly upset because this is a pattern that keeps happening.)",

I actually want to marry and care for someone I love for the rest of my life, but I feel like unless I get some experience first, my dream marriage would be out of the window.

        "text": "Apologies for the word vomit\n\nMy GF (26; AuDHD) and I (29; OCD) have been going through a lot recently that has been built up over about several years of us being together which largely stems from me not supporting her while she really needed me and she then blamed herself/made excuses for me not supporting her. After broaching these feelings with me several months ago, I've been extremely unsure on what to do/how to help because acknowledging/expressing emotions are so foreign to me - that being said, they are equally foreign to her, except she had the strength to bring it up with me, whereas I still really struggle with emotions/feelings and empathising with her.\n\nShe is constantly overwhelmed with her job, her family, her health, and me all triggering her. For me being so dismissive of emotions/feelings and finding it so hard to empathise and offer useful support I ask often a lot of questions to get a picture of the situation (primarily offer a solution, rather than comfort); if I don't ask, then I don't understand? But, the relentless question asking is also triggering for her (or the relentless asking of the wrong questions), and after several years of living together, she's sick of giving me instructions on what to do for her/to help her and answers to how she feels for example.\n\nShe is so fucking tired of carrying all the incredible amount of trauma and stress and strain of her life that she doesn't have the energy to carry mine as well and tell me what to do to help her, because even if she does and I do it, that's not genuine.\n\nSo, I'm at a crossroads. I still don't understand what to do/how to help in so many situations and I feel like if I ask, then that's going to make her feel worse and more triggered and more upset. But if I don't ask and just do something (or nothing..) that I don't *know* will work, and it doesn't, then isn't that worse? &lt;-- The inner dilemma that goes through my mind every day. I'm going to therapy to try to dissect that and understand why I'm like this, which is very helpful, but I need to DO something. I have zero actions because I don't know what to do or how to do it or when to do it.\n\nTL;DR I'm an extremely emotionally dismissive person with severe issues with empathy and compassion for my GF struggling with her trauma/stress/anxiety/mental health. I can't sit on the sidelines telling her that I'm learning about X, but then doing fucking nothing while she collapses in from the weight of her trauma and stress. I LOVE HER SO MUCH, but I overthink everything and just don't know how to help and I feel so fucking awful.",

        "text": "I've been dating a lovely American lady for a couple of months and we've really fallen for each other. I was/(am?) going to meet her one month from now, flight and hotel already booked, we were both looking forward to it. I knew about her anxiety before, she talked to me about it, had her doubts before that she could never get on a plane to see me because of some issue inside her ear that can, at a very low percentage, get worse when flying. I reassured her, telling her it's okay for me to fly to her first and to see how things go; that seemed to calm her, she admitted it being an irrational fear of hers and wanting to talk to her therapist about it; at a later point she mentioned she was required to do a trip from work to either India or Germany (I heavily favoured the second as I'm close and would be able to visit her with relative ease by train), and the way she talked about it let me think she was being positive about tackling her flight anxiety and also reassured by me.\n\nLast Sunday, she had a migraine while we were video chatting. I know migraines from experience, so I gave her space of course and checked in with her the next couple of days to see if she was still in pain etc. She was being very distant (she's working horrible hours at the moment, so I was kind of getting used to that, but even with that in mind, very distant), I put it to the migraine and she said she's going through a rough patch with her migraine. I thought she was still in pain. The next day, she said it really scared her that she wasn't able to see when the migraine hit her (something I also know from experience). It got to me that I only got like two messages a day that seemed avoidant to me; so I asked her about it and she told me she needed space to think about 'everything' which of course scared me immensely. She talked about how her migraine made her realize how 'fragile' her body was, that she has anxiety regarding her body (when I asked what she meant by that, she said she doesn't want to talk about it), that she doesn't want to be a burden, that she doesn't know how she'll ever be able to get on a plane or a boat (we've been talking travelling by boat if she can't fly, but she said she'd been on a cruise in the past), that she needed space to think about 'my life and how I'm alone here' (she's been living alone for a couple of weeks after having moved out from her roommates; prior, she had been scared of living alone because she got attack by a home intruder once in the past; her family lives in another state). \n\nAll of that really, really frightened me and I'm not really good with having to wait for days for someone to message me, but I saw that there was nothing else to do. I also read a few posts on here about dealing with a loved one's anxiety, that giving space is really important in that situations and that kind of helped, but I'm still worried she'll end everything. I prepared a little text I sent her (with her permission) where I tried to reassure her about everything, that I don't see her as a burden at all, that she means the world to me and that the most important thing to me is to be with her and that I won't let her alone, that I'm at her side and she doesn't need to deal with it on her own.\n\nNow, I kind of need some advice on how to deal with the situation, maybe from people who have experience with that kind of anxiety. I really don't want it to end because of that, I really love her to bits and now, short of finally being able to hold her in my arms, she's slipping away and it feels like the end of the world to me :( Please help!\n\nTL;DR: The woman I love needs space to think about ‘everything’ because of her anxiety and I fear she won’t want to continue with me; need perspective of people with experience in that regard.",

        "text": "My (31F) boyfriend (34M) and I have been together for over 5 years. We are met in grad school in North America and are now expats living in two different European countries. Being long distance has been a challenge that we have worked through together. Most recently we have been working on his jealousy (previous post on my profile) which we now more openly discuss and has helped our relationship. \n\nWe are both at the stage of our careers where we are rather nomadic and take on short term (average of about 2 years) contracts dependent on where there is project funding. If you're not in academic research, this slilely sounds insane that two people in their 30s don't have permanent careers yet but I can assure that this is a normal part of our career progression and development and I am not interested in receiving criticisms on this aspect of our lives. \n\nMy boyfriend has always been much more worldly and cultures than I am. He grew up getting to go on trips to Europe, he is fluent in three languages and has a basic proficiency in two additional ones, and he has spent extended periods living in different countries as a result of exchange programs. Compared to me, I grew up and lived in one city until I was 30, I only speak 1 language and I did not leave my home country until I internationally relocated to the UK for work. \n\nI have enjoyed living in the UK and would consider staying permanently but my partner really dislikes the lifestyle there. Ever since we met he talked about his dream to live in Germany (and has lived there for good chunks of time throughout his adult life) and how excited he was for me to see and experience life in Germany because he was convinced that I would also love it there.\n\nRecently for work, I was living in Germany for the past 8 weeks. And I just did no't enjoy it. I found myself struggling with the cultural differences. I felt extremely isolated and depressed because I could not understand the language (I know the same thing can be said for non English speakers in English speaking countries and this has given me a new perspective on how hard this can be) . Throughout my time there I kept expressing this to my boyfriend and he kept insisting that I just needed time and that eventually I would love it as much as him. But I don't. I really don't. And I really don't want to be in a country where i would feel so isolated and dependent on my boyfriend for everything in life in a foreign country. \n\nWe had a more serious conversation about our future geographical location and I can't help but feel selfish. I told him that I think I am interested in living in the UK permanently. He commented how he really does not like the UK and never wanted to live there permanently. Again he expressed how he always wanted to live in Germany. After discussing if we were happy together in our relationship (we both agreed we are), he said that \"Even though I despise the idea of living in the UK and would rather live in any other country, if that's what it means to be with you then fine\".\n\nI feel bad that he might be miserable in his living conditions just because of my preferences. But I also feel like we're at a stand still where there is just potential geographical incompatibility. Am I being selfish if I let him give up his dream of living in Germany to live where I want to live? Am I selfish for not being willing to do the same thing for him? Is this not my place to judge what he wants to do?\n\nTLDR - my boyfriend has always wanted to live permanently in Germany. After being there for work, I just do not like it and would prefer to stay in the UK. He hates the UK but agrees that he would move there if that's what it takes for us to be together. Should I let him throw away his dreams just for me or should I end things (despite loving and caring about him) to allow him to seek out the life he dreamed of that I can't give him?",

I have to sit a lot of exams for this job after certain exams and as long as job performance is good you get a promotion and a good pay rise. Because of previous experience I can skip a few of the exams and because my performance is better than expected I will be getting the promotion earlier than expected. Initially it was supposed to be November at the earliest but because of the reasons I mentioned, my manager said it is likely o be April.\n\nI was excited but got informed by the head of my department that it would likely be July-August instead. I was still happy since it was earlier that initially expected. I mentioned this to my gf and said it's slightly annoying since I was looking forward to it being next month and her response was just \"Some people won't be getting promotions at all. I wont be getting a pay rise anytime soon\". I asked her what that has to do with my promotion and the work I have put in to get it? I asked why, just because other people weren't getting promotions it meant I couldn't be excited about mine and slightly disappointed at it getting moved back a couple of months. \n\nShe just said I'm being entitled complaining about not getting more money sooner when people are on less than me. I asked why she couldn't just be pleased for me and she mentioned again that I knew she wouldn't be getting a promotion this year. The thing is, that's because she's currently working part time while at uni and is starting a full time job in September. I mentioned again that that doesn't take away from my achievements and I expected m partner to be happy for me instead of putting me down. She said I'm refusing to see where she's coming from. Does anyone have any advice?\n\ntl;dr my gf made a negative comment when I mentioned my promotion at work coming sooner than expected and said I am refusing to see things from her perspective.

We went to the same grad school and he said he’s basically been there done that and isn’t interested in doing it again when I graduate. After he told me I got really quiet and we spent the rest of the day in an awkward silence. \n\nThroughout the day though it seemed to be that he wasn’t expecting my sad reaction and was a bit annoyed by it. This made me even sadder because ever since my last semester started I have made it pretty clear how important this day is to me. My high school graduation was very lackluster and I graduated undergrad during the pandemic so I’ve been treating this graduation as THE ONE (I’ve planned everything out in an excel sheet lol). He’s also aware of how sad I am already that my father will not be in attendance as we no longer speak and my brother also can’t come but didn’t elaborate  why. I spent a week crying over the news and disappointment and he knows that so I’m not sure what reaction he thought I would have.\n\nwhen we went to bed last night things were still a little chilly and distanced between us. He fell asleep but I couldn’t so I went to the store to get some sleep aid and speak to my sister. He texted me asking where I was and I told him. When I came back to bed he hugged me which I thought was very nice until he started initiating sex. I don’t know what about the situation or my vibe made it seem like I wanted to have sex but I really didn’t and him initiating contact for the first time all day only to have sex made me so unbelievably sad. He said he initiated because he wanted to do it and wanted to make me happy. I just really wanted a hug. After I told him I wasn’t in the mood he pulled back, turned the other way and went to sleep. \n\nI feel bad for being upset about this because he is a great guy and a great boyfriend the majority of the time but I also feel like he completely misread the room and I feel hurt. I don’t want him to reconsider coming to my graduation since I already know he doesn’t want to be there and that hurts me too.\n\nTL;DR: my bf of over a year told me he had no interest in coming to my graduation then initiated sex while I was still actively sad",

        "text": "My boyfriend never danced with her, but around the 5th time she asked, he said “there will be plenty of opportunities for us to go swing dancing.” This was his version of shutting it down. This woman and him made out together 5 years ago and have been Facebook friends. She was also clearly neglecting her fiancé all night to talk to us. At the end of the night, around 1am, she texted my boyfriend “so good to see you tonight!”\n\nMy boyfriend showed me right away and promised not to text her back (he promised, I did not ask him to do this), but the next day, he texted her back and said, “good to see you and your fiancé too.”\n\nI’m furious. I think he should have shut her down a lot harder the second time she asked him to dance, and I feel completely betrayed that he texted her back. At my request, he unfriended her on Facebook, but during the conversation, I also found out he lied about the number of sexual partners he’s had (30-50 instead of 20-30). I feel like he needs to build back trust but he thinks I’m overreacting a lot. Am I?\n\nTL;DR an engaged woman who made out with my boyfriend 5 years ago kept asking my boyfriend to dance, and he didn’t shut it down the way I thought he would.",

        "text": "I've known this girl for 5 months, and I was attracted to her from the get go. We quickly became good friends and my feelings for her were very clear, and she started giving me mixed signals, we saw each other every day and we were very physical, as far as regular friendships go. A month ago we went out for drinks and I made my attraction clear, but she said she was confused. She said she didn't know if she wanted to be commited into a relationship, and when she asked me if, by chance, I would accept to be into a sexual relationship while still being friends I told her not, because I saw her in another way and I wanted us to be serious. I told her I would wait for her to understand her feelings and that we would still be friends meanwhile.\n\nIn the two weeks that followed the tension between us became so obvious that it was painful at times. I needed to stop myself from trying to kiss her when we were constantly flirting and cuddling, because I had told her I would wait for her. Then two weeks ago I just had to ask her if she was still confused. She was. She said she \"knew she would regret it\" (rejecting me) but she was so confused and she had lots of fears of not being understood coming from her past relationships, even though she knew I was so different from her past boyfriends, and she basically said it was over. When we said goodbye she started crying, when I asked her if she was ok she turned and left me there. It didn't feel right.\n\nWe didn't see or hear from each other for three days and I was feeling miserable, until I asked her to talk, and she basically told me she had missed me and she decided to give it a try and see how it went. We kissed and for the next three days we would see each other, and it was nice (we just made out btw), but I quickly realized, I don't know why, but I didn't have those feelings for her anymore. Just when I started worrying about hurting her by telling her, she became really distant and a week later she told me she couldn't see me as a boyfriend, and we \"broke up\". I told her how I felt too and we stayed friends. We still see each other frequently, but even though the physicality between us is no more I am still very attracted to her sexually and from her looks I think she's too. \n\nAt this point after everything that's happened I think just asking if she wants a sexual relationship without commitment couldn't hurt our friendship, but I don't know if our past could come biting us in the ass. I don't want a serious thing right now, but I think I might be the confused one now (which is weird because I usually know what I want). What to you think?\n\nTL;DR me and my friend started a relationship that lasted 1 week after months of going back and forth. Neither of us wants a serious thing, but we're still in very good terms and she talked about being friends with benefits two weeks before we got together, should I ask her if she wants that even if we have been romantically involved, albeit for a very short time?",

But it was just not for me and I had known for so long, between the age difference and his lack of ambition to do more in his life, among many other things... I knew I had to make that change, but the pain I feel myself for hurting him still weighs heavy. It is hard not to remember that there were so many good times, as much as there were awful times and for a good portion of the first 5 years i was treated terribly. I feel like i blindsided him, and its hard to forgive myself. I don't want to go backwards, and I don't want the life I had before back. But I am wondering if anyone has been in this position before?\n\nTL;DR why do I feel do much guilt for choosing myself, and why even over a year later do I still get overcome with emotions and sadness over it at times? It is not constant, but it does come back and bite me hard. It's like a death has happened and i am mourning.",

They all shared a single room with 2 beds. My girlfriend slept in the same bed as the male. I suggested that the 2 women in relationships sleep together, and the 2 singles sleep together. I found out that my girlfriend slept in the bed with the male, and the other 2 women slept in the other bed. I found that simply disrespectful even if my girlfriend and this man have known each other for around 10 years. To add to that, there was a video posted publicly on snapchat of the man provocatively thrusting behind my girlfriend, then bending her over the bed,  jumping on top of her and pretending to \"do the act\" from behind. \n\nWhen I brought it up that it bothered me, she disregarded my feelings telling me to get over it. And as the classic saying goes, \"He's basically gay\" (His last relationship was with a woman). After trying to bring it up over and over again for months, 6 months later, I finally got a \"I'm Sorry, It shouldn't have happened. I feel betrayed, hurt, and my feelings completely shut down/disregarded. I still see this man, and neither him, nor any of the other 3 in the room have told me anything.\n\nTL;DR My girlfriend of 1 year slept in a bed with a male friend 1 month in on a vacation, and there's also a video of her male friend bending her over and \"Doing the Deed\" with her.

We met our first semester of college and we had already established that we liked each other within the first 3 weeks of school(give or take). Anyway, as we got to know one another I couldn’t help but get this feeling, like it was an intense more than “like” feeling. A feeling that I don’t get with anyone else i’ve liked before. Within the month of knowing him I was already starting to think that I loved him. I’ve never been in a relationship before but I knew that I for sure loved him. I still do, and I’ve even told him how I’ve felt, i always tell him how I feel when I’m around him. They’ll be times like this where these feelings of love are elevated and I just don’t know what to do to express these emotions, especially when I’m not around him. When I can’t just scoop him up to hug or kiss him, tickle him all over, or just lay in bed together. He makes me so happy y’all and I can’t even put it into words. So I figured I’d hop on Reddit and share what I was feeling, maybe others can relate.\n\ntl;dr\nI was watching a movie which made me think about my boyfriend and our relationship.

        "text": "TL;DR: Should I continue to wait for him or is he never going to want a relationship?\n\nLong story, so I (27 Female) have been recently talking to a guy (25 Male) for about 3-4 months now. He lives many states away from me and we have never met in person. When we first started talking it was a lot of getting to know each other and the spark for one another was definitely there. Such as he would even send me morning &amp; goodnight texts. Everything was going great for the first couple months, we even spoke about the idea of meeting up sometime in August. He agreed and said would take time off of work (voluntarily offered) and show me around. I was like great. \n\nI occasionally travel for work and coincidentally my job wanted me to travel out to his state. When I brought it up in conversation I would be traveling for work and possibly staying the weekend. He immediately freaked out &amp; said he was not ready to meet for XYZ reasons and proceeded to tell me he needs more time &amp; yeah. I was understanding and said its okay &amp; that I wasnt expecting to put that type of pressure on him (even though I never mentioned at all that he should see me during that trip).\n\nAfter that we didn’t speak for a few days &amp; the way we texted changed and instead of making convo’s through text he send reels through IG to make small convo and thats as far as we get. Occasionally I have a side hustle which lets me have more privacy then at home. We will call each other and speak for hours at a time 3-6 hours and just recently started face timing each other and talk on phone or FT till we fall asleep.\n\n**Getting to know him has sure been a ride I was not ready for, but yet there is something about him that fascinates me. He is smart, hilarious, pure, sings, sweet and at times a big mush but man does he put on a tough exterior for everyone else. He has had previous bad relationships &amp; last time he was in one was 2.5 years ago, he always asks for my opinions, says things that he questions himself about after “i said that? Thats unlike me”, my take is he is emotionally unavailable due to his history, although he says he would rather stay away from love and is scared of loving someone and that the idea of love fades away with time no matter who you are and getting hurt. He has closed himself off to the idea of being in a relationship but then he does things like Facetime me when he’s at work, talking to me till his battery dies with no charger while having 6-8 hours left in his shift which completely catches me off guard when he does stuff like this.\n\nMe being me, my ass overthinks. But it’s almost as if I am slowly growing on him and he doesn’t know it or maybe he does and he’s guarding his feelings. I don’t pressure, I’m patient, and let him be the free spirit he is since Im aware he likes his independence and freedom. I have feelings for him but if I tell him my suspicion is he will run. Help, thoughts!? Am I crazy for thinking he wants something more and that I should wait for him.",

        "text": "I feel like I’m going fucking crazy, so hear me out. My bf and I have sex every day and often multiple times a day. I always thought I satisfy him enough. But almost every time I leave the house (for like an hour) before he goes to work or I come back, he still needs to masturbate/watch porn. He also asks beforehand when I will leave. It seems to me like he’s just waiting till I leave although I always ask him if he still needs something sexually and he says 'No it would hurt but thank you’. It would probably not bother me like that if he wouldn’t leave his fucking tissues all around his entire room. It’s a very distinguished smell so I smell it directly if I enter his room or when I pick them up to throw them away. If I ask him why he says they’re old (they are literally wet). I know he watches porn and we already had several fights that left me feel insecure although I was okay with it in the beginning and watched some even. But looking into the industry I’m very disgusted by it and can’t enjoy it. What most shocked me were the several child r cases and revenge porn, so I don’t really understand why people still watch and support it. Nevertheless, I said it was okay if it happens in a discrete way and I don’t now it every time he watches it. But obviously I know because his tissues are everywhere. I read other men opinions on why they are still watching in a happy relationship and the main reasons were: \"My sex drive is higher than hers”(That is not the case), \"If she is away for a long time”(I’m away for an hour AND we had sex beforehand), \"If she’s not in the mood\"(Was never the case). When I asked him why he does that he says that all men need variety and that one woman is just not enough. He also said that if porn wouldn’t exist he would probably cheat to get this variety. That fucking blows my mind and makes me feel very insecure and not enough. When I asked if we could just record or own porn he said it would be boring because he needs variety and needs different women when he’s masturbating. When we talked about it he also said he doesn’t save it because that’s what I was afraid of. But recently he had some recorded ones on his desktop very blatantly. I didn’t snoop ( don’t want to hurt myself), there were just there on his front page. So now I know that he actually screenrecords them and saves them in a very secured way I would never get to see because ‘it’s Password protected'. Makes me wonder what crazy shit he watches if it has that big emotional value for him that he needs to collect it and hide it. I also asked if we could recreate whatever it is but he said that’s not possible (it’s not hentai or anime). The porn on his desktop was so normal shit but okay. So now I’m getting incredibly insecure every time I leave the house because why am I still not enough for you? Why do you need other women when you have pics and videos of me/us? What is this crazy kink no one can ever know about?\n\nTl;DR: Feeling not enough for my bf because of his constant porn consumption",

        "text": "For the last 6 years of my dating life I have dated with very little thought or preference to religion. I’ve always held the opinion that, as long as my partner let me practice my faith it wouldn’t be an issue. I’ve had quality relationships but continually seem to meet people not ready for long-term commitment (I’ve been either an undergrad or grad student that whole time and dated mostly other students). I’ve been getting frustrated with the apparent lack of commitment and generally just the dating pool. \n\nA close friend of mine suggested I start to date Catholic girls more purposefully. Honestly the early returns have been great. They generally share similar values and are more ready for the long-term commitment I’m looking for.\n\nHowever, there has appeared a quandary. Many of these girls are more guarded in respect to sex. I have some kinks that I want a significant other to be open to. But for many of the girls I’ve dated talking about any sex itself is almost taboo. It definitely makes me concerned that my kink won’t be accepted. \n\nWhich leads me to my quandary. Do I return to dating a more general pool (that has been more accepting of my kink and easier to talk about sex with)? Or do continue dating the Catholic girls and hope one of them will just be more accepting? I’m really interested in what you would do with this same problem?\n\nTl;dr: Do I return to dating a more general pool (that has been more accepting of my kink and easier to talk about sex with)? Or do continue dating the Catholic girls and hope one of them will just be more accepting?",

If I'm affectionate and loving, cuddling or sleeping with him, it seems to turn him off and those are the times we do not usually have sex. \n\nHas anyone here experienced this also? He is looking into therapy for what he (we) feels may be porn/sex addiction, but I'm wondering if it's also attachment stuff that causes this chasing, which could I imagine be interwoven with the PA stuff. He's told me in the past that he's a chaser, he doesn't know why he does this.",

        "text": "\nIs it worth it?\n\nI have had a boyfriend of 4 years. He has always been utterly obsessed and everyone tells me so and how he talks about me when i’m not around. We spend every day together and love each other. He showers me with compliments and is always a text or yell away. Genuinely.\n\nAt the end of last year early this year I said I couldn’t do it anymore because I had kept telling him I wanted flowers for valentines and other occasions ect and I felt he didn’t care. He told me he did over and over and blew up my phone asking to do anything so i went to him he started giving me flowers and we were good. Then, he did something crazy, we got in an argument at his mums and he said some personal things about me in front of her and called me crazy and I said he was disrespectful and called it off and moved out of our apartment we had together. \n\nHe was telling me he knew he was wrong immediately after and he is stupid and won’t do that again and will explain to his mum he’s in the wrong not me. I didn’t feel comfortable or believe he actually admitted wrong to his mum. (he hadn’t, it felt he had ruined me and his mums only connection) \n\nWe were hanging out on and off for a week. We started going out places again and it was a relationship to me, he was calling himself my boyfriend out and telling guys hitting on me to back off and he said he wouldn’t know what to do with himself if i left for another guy. \n\nA week later after seeing him heaps i found out he had had a girl over 4 fn times…… I have never been so hurt in my entire existence the pain of betrayal is so hurtful because she was there just hours before me and then after i’d stay there and go see a friend he’d invite her over again. \n\nAfter it came to light I left his apartment we once lived in together and took every last bit of my belongings. The girl told me that he couldn’t get hard the times she came over and it was “barely sex”. But he cheated and made me sleep in the bed they were in together so it hurts. The feeling of betrayal is unmatched. \n\nThe same night he moved out of his own apartment and back into his mums and organised therapy for himself twice a week and stopped smoking told his entire family what he did and cut off all his friends who knew what he did and didn’t stop him. I reached out to him crying asking how he could do this to me and he said “because i’m an insecure person i wanted an ego boost because i thought u were going to find better, im so sorry this isn’t your fault, im doing everything i can do fix this i don’t know why i did this to us i wish i could wake up and it never happened” he repeated similar wordings again and again and answered every question i had about his cheating. \n\nHe says he will complete his therapy and do anything for me and if i still want him when he’s done he will buy us tickets to anywhere in the world to see because “there’s more to life”. And “I don’t want her I thought me and you were done for good and I tried to get over u, but I couldn’t. It was selfish and inexcusable I will get the answers for u why I did this to us I was insecure and stupid I just want to hug u so tight right now.” I told him no obviously but it hurts so bad because I loved him and information online is conflicting because it talks about a cheater in a different light to this circumstance.\n\nI ask, does this sound like the man who would do this again? \nWas it cheating?\n\nTL;DR: He basically cheated more than once on me but is remorseful and he couldn’t get hard for her and is doing everything to try fix it.",

        "text": "Have been dating since September. Girlfriend works as a hostess at a popular restaurant in the city. A few days before going skydiving with a handful of coworkers, I found a snowboarding bag that she was fixing for a coworker via hand sowing. She said he had asked months before and since they were skydiving later in the week he had given her the bag. Until discovering this bag for myself on the couch i had never heard this coworkers name in the 6 months that we had lived together. Upon questioning her about him she claimed they were barely friendly w/ each other. Yet, there has his bag. I told her off the rip that I didn’t like her sowing the bag up for this coworker i had never heard of and told her he made me feel insecure for various reasons (He’s older, has a better position in the industry than i do and also is ripped physically - i’m extremely forthcoming and honest lol.) She also informed me that he’d be skydiving with her the next day. The next day she left to go skydiving with about 10 colleagues and had left around 9:25 AM. Her drive up was about 2 hours long and i called her after waking up at  10:45 AM to no answer. I was immediately suspicious because if you’re driving alone in a car you’d obviously pick up. She continued to ignore me (texts, calls, you name it) until 8:50 pm, almost 12 hours later - with a text saying that her and a bunch of her friends were at a female coworkers house just chilling and that she’d be home in an hour or two. Fast forward to 10:15 pm. I get home and the car we share is still not back. I start panicking but realize she might be running a little late and bide my time talking to friends to ease my worsening panic attack. Its now 11:45 and i’m sick to my stomach, she has our car and hasnt picked up a call or text from me the entire day even after diving 13k feet out of a plane. I finally give in and DM one of her coworkers who was skydiving with the group that day, only to find out my girlfriend lied &amp; went to the guys house with two of his best mates to continue hanging. I instantly texted my gf in a rage and suspected infidelity (who wouldn’t?) upon getting home and in the days following gf has admitted to ignoring my texts and calls and making a selfish decision to instead indulge in her own fun then give me peace of mind. She says that there is 0 attraction between said coworker nor his two best-friends. She has cried for days and apologized profusely while claiming that i’m the love of her life and that she’s shameful of it all and it not only has fucked up our home life but her work life because they found out she was ignoring me and has ignited work rumors involving her. Throughout all of this she has been adamant that there was no cheating, flirting, touching, or anything of the like - and that it was simply a selfish mistake to just continue having fun. I have found no incriminating texts or messages. What should I do? Keep in mind she was previously in a 7 year tumultuous/semi-abusive relationship in which she was degraded and controlled. A large part of me believes she didn’t cheat as all the messages i’ve found on her phone corroborate her story and multiple people (unfortunately, all guys) were there. I might be leaving a few details out but i’m head over heels for this girl and im willing to forgive but damn this one hurt yall! She loves spending quality time, has bought us a ps5, pays half the bills and pays her dues most of the time even tho i’m a very generous and accommodating bf. \n\nTldr girlfriend lied to me about where she was at a day after i told her that a certain coworker made me feel insecure. Texted her other coworker after being ignored all day and caught her in a lie about where she was at.",

I know that doesn't seem long, but we've known each other for several years. We actually met through our mutual friend (M). We were both looking for a new place to live, and decided it worked out best this way. He was dating another girl at the time, but they broke up months later. My dating life has been very uneventful until I started dating J. I've always wanted a relationship, I just never found the right person.\n\nEventually, J and I found we were both single at the same time. We had a few common interests, and we went from there. It was easy since we were already living together. J and I get along great.\n\nCut to 3 weeks ago, M asked if she could stay with us. She's a single friend, probably my nest female friend I've known since even before J. Turns out her landlord was evicting her roommates (who refused to take care of their place) and the whole rental agreement went up in smoke. So she needed a hand getting on her feet. I asked J, and he was happy to help. I moved moat of my stuff into his room, and M got my room. This is where the trouble started I guess.\n\nEver since M started staying with us, J has constantly been going out at night, more than usual. He rarely invites me, and never M. He also tends to be very distant at home, antisocial, and grumpy most days. So M and I hang out most of the day together. We've gotten to the point now where we stay up late and watch movies most nights, or binge Netflix and have some drinks. Other times I'll visit her in my old room and just chat.\n\nShe's giving me attention, asking me how my day is... I'm really enjoying my time with her. She's nice, she's gorgeous, and we have a lot in common. I've just never been in such an intimate living situation with her before, and I may be starting to see things in her I didn't before.\n\nAm I wrong here? I feel guilty.\n\ntldr: falling for female roommate...not sure if boyfriend is the cause",

        "text": "I moved across the country away from my entire family recently. I offered to let my sister live with me because her grades were really bad from lack of discipline/attention at home, not realizing what I was signing up for. I've been helping her with schoolwork for the last few months, but it basically boiled down to me doing all of her schoolwork for her every day and parenting her over the phone because she wouldn't listen to anyone else in our family.\n\nMy feelings really shifted after she yelled at me when I asked her to explain what she learned in one of her classes. She said \"Why do I have to explain it to you? I already did the school work in class?! I don't want to do it!\" and I said \"you failed all of your tests last semester. You got Fs in everything, so I need to make sure you understand what you were taught in class.\" This was after I wrote many essays for her, gave her answers to so many assignments she didn't turn in, and helped her cram all night for a test she failed to mention until a day before. I had to reteach everything her teachers taught her AND do her homework for her on top of all of my responsibilities. It was really stressing me out because I had just moved across the country alone when I've never lived on my own before, I had my first mortgage, car payments, quarterly taxes (I'm self employed), expensive tech issues related to my work, declining health (I had an injury last year I'm still recovering from, plus obesity issues), and I struggled all my life with anxiety around doing everyday things which is why it took so long for me to move out on my own.\n\nThat incident where the student nearly beat a teacher to death in Florida happened at the high school my sister is supposed to enroll in, so I told my mom (we have different moms) that she may not be safe because of how poorly the staff and police handled that situation. My mom says to let my sister decide because she wants me to take care of my sister. The school in my sister's area has never had a violent incident like that occur, so I know she'll be fine since our other sister graduated from there. My sister will probably still choose to live with me anyway, but besides my personal feelings, I'm not sure if we should let her go to a school where the staff were so slow to help a woman getting her skull bashed in and the police just let the attacker walk off. There's another school in the same country about 20 mins away, but the ratings for that school are worse.\n\nHonestly, reteaching my sister everything and doing her homework for her over the next 4 years while trying to get her to sleep and wake up on time, teach her to practice basic hygiene, buy her whatever she needs, limit her social media/gaming time, cook for her, take her to doctor/dentist appointments, drive her wherever she needs to go, get her to exercise, emotionally support her, etc might not be something I can handle since I can barely do it for myself.\n\nWhen I offered to take her in, I thought I'd just figure it out and be okay with taking care of someone else's child because I'm childless. I thought I'd be okay with dying alone without ever getting married or having children of my own, but now that I've had more time to consider it, I'm not so sure. I've never been on a date before because of a lot of past trauma/mental health issues, and just being more picky than I deserve to be. So maybe kids aren't in the cards for me, but I'd like to figure that out sooner and later because of the health risks that come with waiting too long.\n\nI'm on the fence since it was my idea in the first place and my sister has shown improvement; it would be good to see her become a happier and productive person. Though I can't help but think about how her family has always shamed me and talk shi.t about me because I was a depressed, unhealthy, unemployed shut in for many years and now that I managed to pull myself out of that dark period of my life, they want me to undo the problems they caused for my sister. She has parents, a grandmother, grandfather, aunts, uncles, older sister and brother at home, yet they've given up on her. They've already managed to establish their own families, so they think it doesn't matter if I focus on someone else's kid instead of figuring out if I want to get married and have kids of my own while I'm still healthy and able to. I realize it was my idea to offer to let her live with me in the first place, but I didn't think too deeply about the situation before making a decision and I kind of regret acting so hastily and being so short sighted. \n\nOn the other hand, I don't expect to meet a guy any time soon because of the decline of relationships. People aren't having kids at they rate they used to anymore and there are a lot of people that don't value marriage anymore. Seeing how apathetic people have become worries me. I also want to lose weight first/improve my appearance and get my life together, so my sister being with me for a year might be okay as long as she respects me and the rules of my home. I'm so torn on this, I don't know what to do.\n\nTLDR: I offered to let my sister move with me across the country, not realizing how much responsibility taking care of someone else's child would be; the school she's supposed to enroll it was on the news recently for an attack on a teacher, and I'm not sure what to do because I'm a mess.",

His behaviour is very confusing and it would be great to have some non-bias insight. Am I wasting my time with this guy? \n\nCONS \n\n- He always makes plans last minute or on the day\n- The only compliments I get are about my looks. Nothing else. \n- I have no idea how he feels about me. The most I get is ‘I like you’ and ‘I want to see you’ \n- He’s cancelled on me last minute a few times now with some weak excuses \n- He left me waiting for him for hours on an important date because he got drunk and it ended up being too late to do anything \n- After we’re intimate he won’t come near me he said he needs space after and will sit on another sofa\n- He works away half the time \n- We only seem to see each other a few hours on days when we can probably do longer\n- We were both off work for a week and there was only one day where we could meet up. He said he could only do an hour because he had the gym\n- We never go away anywhere \n- Most dates are Netflix and chill but we will go out for the odd meal or cinema now and again \n- He’s not very affectionate \n- He got irritated last time I brought up that I didn’t feel he was making enough effort \n\nPROS\n\n- He does get me gifts now and again\n- When he’s away for work we talk for hours everyday \n- He does always text everyday \n- When I have tried walking away he fights to keep me I have tried this 3 times now \n- I’m on his social media and he’s not secretive with his phone\n- He does apologise when he does something wrong \n- He’s introduced me to his kids \n- He does always initiate us getting together or texts first \n- He will spend his Sat nights with me \n- He’s very attractive and funny \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend’s behaviour is confusing and he doesn’t make me feel secure. Am I wasting my time on him?",
