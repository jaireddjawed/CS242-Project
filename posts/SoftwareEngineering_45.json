For one, it seems like their glassdoor reviews are mixed with most people leaving poor reviews complaining about management being somewhat abusive. They have a string of five star reviews in December, but most of the other reviews are more spread out.\n\nIt also seems like they want someone who can do exactly 24 hours a week and no less: they've even asked me to move my schedule around to accommodate them, telling me that any position would want that kind of availability... I'm hoping they aren't going to ask me to work overtime or take the work home...\n\nI'm also not sure what to ask for compensation: I mentioned on the phone that the internships I'm looking at are all for 15/hr, but looking online, the median starting sallary is around 30/hr... Is that what I should ask for?\n\nThanks for the help,\nSol",

        "text": "I got to a point where I wanted to test behaviour under a certain new boolean condition (basically enable/disable behaviour of a method, log the situation and silently return) and found that the class under test created files and directories before calling some processing on the contents of said files. Processing was in a class that actually called an executable. Needless to say, unit testing, not possible. Integration tests were there for it at a very high level in the application. \n\nRather than setting up the convoluted preconditions for a test, I split off the file and directory creation to a class with interface. Dependency injected it, mocked it out in a test and provided a default constructor for my main class that instantiates the implementation of said interface. The processor was already a separate class with interface, so pushed that out via the constructor too. Now, I could mock out the input setup as well as processing call, set expectations and switch my boolean in a test. \n\nNow I have three small classes that do one thing each: set up directory structure, do processing (which actually calls an external executable...) and orchestrate that. \n\nA colleague of mine disagrees with the changes and found it modular enough as it was. I, however, feel that these changes made it easier for me to verify the functionality I added. \n\nI wanted to share this, because frankly I wonder if I should have gone with the heavier integration tests (and dirty hybrids) involving database access and whatnot that this team is used to, rather than splitting classes in a TDD fashion and facing disagreement, which I hate above anything else... \n\nWould you have done the same as I did, or would you have chosen to \"not rock the boat\" and stick with the integration tests? I'm considering doing the latter from now on.",

        "text": "This may belong in /r/jobs too I don't know.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Brief back-story:**  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n* Have a BS in Computer Science  \n* Pursuing a MS in Software Engineering (1 semester to go)  \n* Have 2 years experience as a .NET developer at previous job  \n* Started current job in ~August for more pay.  \n* Come from a consulting/networking background with ~7 years experience there.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI left my networking career for software engineering because I find software to be infinitely more thrilling than networks. This was a great decision and I haven't regretted it. I took an \"entry level\" job as a .NET developer making about half what I was making as a network specialist ($57k salary). Two years later the company hadn't given me a raise and I grew substantially in knowledge so I left to pursue a better paying job.  \nI found a job paying $80k and after negotiating got it to $90k so I took it. This is a \"Contract-to-hire\" position and so far everybody is pleased with my effort and work ethic etc. I see no reason why I wouldn't get the full time offer when this 6 month period ends in ~Feb.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**The problems:**  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThis company is a contractor for a government agency, and it appears to me that things are VERY VERY poorly executed. I thought my last position was decent, I never had an issue with the work, the process or the people (although I think they could have improved a few things with their process) and only left for the pay.  \nIt wasn't until I got to my current position that I realized just how poorly some code/system can be designed. Things we do here:  \n* Use a CMS for government employees to enter data into the system  \n* The CMS exports XML. We have a \".NET\" application that translates the XML into HTML and spits out a website (basically).  \n* There is HTML and occasionally CSS ALL THROUGH the C#. This just 50% of what the C# even does, is print out HTML content.  \n* CSS and stylings can be found in CSS files, inside the C#, or even hard-coded into the content entered in the CMS.  \n* The deployment process is done by the collective development team, each doing different pieces  \n* The environment developers work in is the same one the testers test in. This means that for a week or two while the testers are testing, the developers cannot work. I sit around doing things like... typing this up on Reddit for lack of anything to work on.  \n* Communication is terrible. People are allowed to WFH but there is no Skype for Business or any other regularly used conference tools to communicate with remote workers. (Some people work in the office 1 day a week).  \n* We claim that we are AGILE and yet I've been here for 4 months now and have never heard mention of a \"sprint.\" We don't story point our tickets and ticketing is done by team leads without feedback from developers and with little or no information in them. Almost every ticket I get I have to go ask for the details.  \n* The people who implemented these processes are still here and in leadership positions, and have fragile egos. One in particular absolutely cannot admit he is wrong even if it's a simple thing like \"yea, this tool does give you file paths.\" \"NO, it doesnt... OH LOOK that must be new, that wasn't there before they must have just released that.\"  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have requested more work and people say \"we're working on getting tickets\" but they never come because there isn't much to work on. I struggle with this because the days just crawl by when I have nothing to do. I'd rather be busy all day. Having only worked at 2 places as a software engineer (which are polar opposites of each other in terms of organization and efficiency) I don't know what's \"normal.\" Was I in the worlds most efficient office before or am I in a nightmare now? Is normal somewhere in between? I am hesitant to accept a full time role here because I genuinely feel like almost everything we do here is just bad... VERY BAD practice and I don't want to learn from this place. I also don't want to look like I'm job-hopping too frequently either, so I'm not sure what to do.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n**TLDR;**  \nI used to work for a really great company, now I work for a really inefficient company that I believe does everything wrong and I'm not sure if I should leave early or stick it out and learn these practices as a \"what not to do.\"",
