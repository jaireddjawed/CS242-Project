These pictures seem like the men were extremely close, hanging around naked, pranking each other, I couldn’t believe all the naked pictures that he had. Just looking at the pics it looks like men having fun on a gay cruise. He also was very close to an old lesbian couple, and in his last days talked about how cool they were a lot.  I’m wondering if he was in the closest his whole life and that’s why he admired that couple for living openly? Or am I overthinking it and those naked pics of him swatting other men’s butts are totally innocent.  Maybe I’m asking in the wrong place as there might not be a lot of info about it.

He also said that the Vietnamese AK rounds would penetrate the vest, but wouldn't go all the way through, and they'd hit the back of the vest and ricochet inside the Marine. He said an officer had the platoon pile up all of their flak jackets and Grandpa Chromedome torched them with the flamethrower.\n\nThe second story: Grandpa Chromedome's squad was tasked with searching villages for cached weapons, and he would burn down huts with the flamethrower. One day Grandpa was too sick to go out, so his assistant gunner went out with the flamethrower. Grandpa says the assistant took a bullet to the fuel tank and burned to death. \n\nI don't think Grandpa's lying about any of this, but he might be misremembering. Could I get a fact check?",

I'm sure my modern sensibilities are playing into this, but they just seem so cartoonish, unrealistic, and don't seem to project the same sense of awe of the craftsmanship. Given the incredible detail and mastery displaced in the sculpture of these statues, I can only imagine that the colouring would have been equally masterful.\n\nAre there any surviving example of fully painted statues/buildings for comparison?",

By peninsular India, I'm mainly referring to regions south of the Vindhyas, and beyond the 'Aaryaawarta' and 'Madhyadesha' regions, so especially the below regions of today's India and Bangladesh:\n\nWest Bengal, Bangladesh, Odisha (coastal?), Gujarat, southern Madhya Pradesh (and the strip of Rajasthan between these), Maharashtra and Goa. \n\nAs I understand the other states and regions in between were much more recently 'Aryanized' and still have rich tribal/aboriginal populations and a more visibly mixed cultural heritage.\n\nIn addition, do we know from what period the Indo-Aryan populations from the Himalayan hills (Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand in India and west Nepal) linguistically originate? The earliest I could find are the numismatics of kingdoms like Trigarta, Audumbara, Kuninda, Wemaka from between 200 BCE - 200 CE (I think?)\n\nThe maps indicating the distribution of some cultures like the Northern Black Polished Ware seem to give an indication of some kind of 'Aryanization' distribution although that does include some Dravidian-speaking regions in the Deccan plateau.\n\nWikipedia articles on Kalinga for example make its origin out to be as early as 1100 BCE or so, which seems inconsistent with the 'Vedic era' dating I've otherwise found. [This map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Late_Vedic_Culture_%281100-500_BCE%29.png) which if correct (likely is?) seemingly contradicts that.\n\nSo could you please give me clearer information on the dating?
