        "text": "**\"If every person is a different existence, with a different perspective... If every person has a different world, then how do people understand each other?\"**\n\nKnown as Subarashiki Hibi in Japan, Wonderful Everyday is a bizarre, existential trip of varying genres and viewpoints: what begins a tropey anime slice of life story turns into a surreal murder mystery, and finally a Bildungsroman with themes of identity and the meaning of happiness.\n\nConstant throughout the narrative are allusions to Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus - which informs the central themes of connection between the self and the perception of the world. Other philosopical and literary works are also tightly integrated into the narrative; including but not limited to: Cyrano de Bergerac, Critique of Pure Reason, and the poetry of Emily Dickinson.\n\nBe warned that some early parts of the story are frustratingly slow, and seemingly lacking in the philosopical backbone of other sections of the narrative; but you will later realize their purpose in the overall thesis of the work. Another aspect to be worried about is 18+ content; including various forms of rape.\n\nHowever, all of these potential setbacks are worth it, for a thought provoking, literary, and ultimately optimistic Visual Novel masterpiece. I honestly believe this might be looked back on as one of the best works of the 2010s - it is something I have thought about everyday.\n\n**\"Live happily! That is all.\"**\n\nP.S: Make sure to download and install the 18+ patch, or else you'll only be able to access the slice-of-life portion.",

        "text": "I've never been so emotionally effected by a piece of literature. I finished it no more than 15 minuets ago, in that time I sucked down at least three cigarettes and I'm lighting the fourth as I'm typing this. \n\nThis is a tremendous story about many things. It's a story about promises. A story about war. A story about rape. A story about the horrible atrocities humans are capable of committing. Most importantly (for me) it's a story about love in the face of all of those atrocities. Mouawad's ability to articulate such gut-wrenching events and still leave the reader with a sort of strange upliftment is unbelievable. I think this fact speaks directly to the heart of the story. To explain why I think that I will quote the play and continue to explain afterwards:\n\n&gt; Nihad: ...No beat, no sense of showbiz. That's where I find my dignity... A little red nose. A little clown nose. What does it mean? My personal dignity is a funny face left by the woman who gave birth to me.\n\n\n\n&gt; Nawal: *(in the letter to the twins)* Are you smiling? If you are smiling, don't stifle your laughter. Because I don't stifle mine. It's the laughter of rage.\n\nTo me, the theme of love or laughter in the face of horrible events is clear in just these two quotes. Nihad is doning a clown nose at the end of a statement about the atrocities he committed, a sort of ironic visualization of the theme of love or laughter in the face of atrocities. Nawal almost says it directly with the \"laughter of rage\" line. Laughter and rage or love and cruelty are naturally juxtaposed by their definitions, but Mouawad cleverly weaves them together which is why I think at the end of this play the reader is (at least I was) left with an uncomfortable feeling of upliftment and horror simultaneously. \n\nHonestly *brilliant*. \n\n***\n\nI think that's all I can think of to write about this play, but I intend to read it again soon to try to pick it apart some more. \n\nA few questions for those who have read it:\n\n- Would you agree with my haphazardly constructed analysis of what I think to be one of the core themes of the play?\n\n- Are there other themes that you think ride higher or are more prominent/important than that of \"love in the face of atrocities\"?\n\n- How many boxes of tissues did you go through?\n\nI'm going to go crawl in bed with my dog and cry for a while now. \n\nEdit: I'd love it if people said something about why they downvoted, instead of just downvoting and moving on.

        "text": "Half way through the book, I splurged out some of my frustrations with it here, in this thread: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/87t04t/inside\\_ulysses\\_is\\_a\\_great\\_book\\_trying\\_to\\_get\\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/87t04t/inside_ulysses_is_a_great_book_trying_to_get_out/)\n\nWhich generally got a pretty negative reaction. \n\nThis surprised me: I was uttering an opinion which is not unique and I offered some justification for it. Given there are no right and wrong answers in literature, I didn't expect to meet with quite so much dismay. Perhaps I didn't give enough explanation.\n\nWell, I've now finished it. I'm very glad I did: it's a unique book which bought me a lot of pleasure. That said, the opinions I expressed in my previous thread have not changed significantly. Some chapters are challenging, but rewarding. But whether they are rewarding enough for the effort is a moot point, especially the ones that demand significant external knowledge to enjoy. And there are a couple which are simply boring, almost for the sake of it. At times it feels like Joyce was simply packing the book just in order to follow the Odyssey. \n\nAnyway, to further stimulate discussion and back up my opinion, here's a chapter breakdown of my brief opinions.\n\n1 &amp; 2 - these are essentially standard novel format, albeit in Joyce's unique lyrical style. I found them very enjoyable and engaging.\n\n3 - is very difficult, so early in the book. But it's an education in how powerful and deep stream of consciousness can be in character exploration, and a fascinating indication of how inventive Joyce was with the format and the language.\n\n4 - back to standard novel format again, but still with the lovely lyricism, and the exploration of Bloom is wonderfully rich and human. It's exciting, at this point, to imagine spending the rest of the novel with him.\n\n5 - Although perfectly readable, this chapter is really quite dull. We learn a little about Bloom's sexual peccadilloes but not much more, to my mind, of value. Having built up enthusiasm for Bloom, this chapter wastes it.\n\n6 - I got a lot of stick for criticising this chapter, so I went back and re-read it. And yes, it's richer and deeper than I remembered. Bloom's musing upon mortality and his dead son are emotionally arresting, and his interactions in the carriage are important in marking him as an outsider, the \"wandering Jew\". I think perhaps it suffers from being sandwiched between two very dull chapters. Which brings me to ...\n\n7 - is terrible, the worst, most tedious bit of the whole novel. I almost gave up in the middle of this. Joyce seems very pleased with his conceit of weaving a narrative in a newspaper office around headlines and use of rhetorical flourishes. But really, nothing of value happens and we learn nothing about the characters we didn't already know. \n\n8 - we're back on track, pushing deeper into Bloom's psyche again, with some fine writing exploring humanities relationship with its animal instincts.\n\n9 - I have mixed feelings about this. If you know Hamlet, you'll likely enjoy the fine piece of literary criticism at the center of the chapter. I do, and I did. I find it difficult, though, that Joyce chose to build a whole chapter of the novel around Shakespeare. Whatever the value, it's deliberately elitist. \n\n10 - the second point at which I almost gave up. Initially there's a lot of fun to be had with the new characters introduced, often drawn with detached humour, and with the technical challenge of routing them round the city. But it gets old after a while, and increasingly confusing, to no great value. We'll not meet a number of these characters again.\n\n11 - this is perhaps the chapter which best exemplifies \"difficult but rewarding\". It's absolutely lovely to read, especially if you sound it out in your head, and the devices of musicality which Joyce employs are sometimes breathtaking in their originality. But at the same time, as the chapter wore on I completely lost the thread of the narrative. For the first time I had to consult a chapter summary to work out what was going on.\n\n12 - my favourite chapter, as it turns out. A delight. Full of clever and entertaining play on both words and metaphors to do with being poked in the eye, and a fine deconstructions of both the of Irish nationalism, its culture and its history. Now, this is a subject with which I'm vaguely familiar and I couldn't help but wonder: maybe I'm missing symbolism in other chapters that would make them just as enjoyable for me, if I saw it? Having now finished and read some more notes on the book, I suspect not. But I can't be sure.\n\n13 - another hugely enjoyable ride, making fun at the expense of the classic mass romance.\n\n14 - the third time I almost put the book aside. It's very clever, sure, but no-one except literature graduates are going to get what Joyce is attempting to do here, or appreciate the work he must have put in to achieve it with such skill. For the rest of us, we're left with an almost unreadable narrative which contains some important plot points. This is literary elitism and snobbery at its absolute worst. \n\n15 - much like chapter 10, this is fun for a while, but outstays its welcome and becomes a bore. It's more engaging than chapter 10 because it's so inventive, both in form and in detail. Exploring the character's psyche through the form of a hallucinogenic play is brilliant.  You get the sense Joyce really enjoyed writing it but finally saw it was too long and rushed the end. \n\n16 - enjoyed the way this chapter blends style, narrative and character development together in order to communicate its theme of confusion and exhaustion.\n\n17 - my second favourite chapter, a tour-de-force of inventive style, punctuated with some quite brilliant lyrical inventions. The Q&amp;A format is so flexible, it makes me wonder why it hasn't been used more in the novel format, following Joyce.\n\n18 - a powerful close, stylistically inventive and such a rich, brilliant exploration of a female character, especially by a male author.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there we have it. I still feel there are many chapters which would benefit from being shorter - much shorter in some cases. I'd advise anyone who wants to read it to try and, if they hit difficulties, to simply skip a chapter, read a plot summary, and start the next one. There's too much brilliance here to let the turgid, elitist elements turn you off.",
