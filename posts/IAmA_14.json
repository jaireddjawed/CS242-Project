We’ll use these deep space exploration systems [on future Artemis missions to send astronauts to the Moon](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/) and create a long-term presence on the lunar surface, preparing for our next giant leap: sending the first humans to Mars.\n\nArtemis I was an uncrewed mission to fully test and understand the rocket and spacecraft before astronauts fly to the Moon, but [Commander Moonikin Campos](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/purposeful-passenger-artemis-i-manikin-helps-prepare-for-moon-missions-with-crew) and our other [test manikins](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/orion-passengers-on-artemis-i-to-test-radiation-vest-for-deep-space-missions/) were aboard to collect flight data and measure radiation levels. Orion also carried [payloads](https://www.nasa.gov/launching-science-and-technology.html) designed to help prepare for crewed long-duration missions, including biological experiments and several CubeSats that got a lift to space for their own individual missions.\n\nAs Orion entered its distant retrograde orbit around the Moon, taking it farther than any spacecraft designed to carry humans to deep space and safely return them to Earth, we captured some incredible [photos](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjAfKs1) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2aBZuCeDwlS_2sGfYSvcoJZLRG069i-H)—and there’s a lot more info that we’ll be able to get from Orion now that it’s back on the ground.\n\nNow that the Artemis I mission is complete, what’s next for lunar exploration? How will Artemis I build the foundation we need to secure a long-term human presence on the Moon? What do the future of Artemis missions look like?\n\nAsk us anything! We are:\n\n* **Sharmila Bhattacharya:** NASA’s Senior Program Scientist for Space Biology, NASA Headquarters (SB)\n* **John Blevins:** Space Launch System Chief Engineer, Marshall Space Flight Center (JB)\n* **Jim Free:** NASA Associate Administrator, Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters (JF)\n* **Sarah Noble:** Artemis Lunar Science Lead, NASA Headquarters (SN)\n* **Carla Rekucki:** Lead Test Director of Exploration Ground Systems, Kennedy Space Center (CR)\n* **Michelle Zahner:** Mission Planning and Analysis Lead, Orion Vehicle Integration Office, Johnson Space Center (MZ) \n\nWe’ll be around to answer your questions from **2-3pm ET (1900-2000 UTC)**.

They guarantee FHLBs’ debt, exceeding $1 trillion today, a $6.3 billion annual subsidy. FHLB members gain access to cheap funding and dividends, but taxpayers receive very little benefit. \n\nThe FHLBs’ regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), has taken note of this misallocation of resources and has launched a “comprehensive review” of the FHLBs. Now is the opportunity to reform the mission, operations, and purpose of the FHLBs.\n\n-What are the FHLBs? Why were they created? How are they governed? Who owns them?\n-How relevant are the FHLBs today?\n-Should the FHLBs be required to do more to support affordable housing?\n-Are there other public purposes that could benefit from this unique funding model?\n-How can increased access to the FHLBs, a unique form of subsidized funding, benefit other sec\ntors? Think: climate change remediation, infrastructure businesses, the housing supply-chain.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/Lju9CF4)!",
