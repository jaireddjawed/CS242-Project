It's nothing very creative - I'm not expected to create new results - it's more supposed to teach me new area of math. I'm working on topics ranging from modules, inverse limits of modules/rings, exact sequences (short and long ones), module complexes, cyclic complexes, valuation, Noetherian rings, Nakayama's lemma. I'm second year undergrad student and I don't really know where I can learn those topics. With this post, I'm asking you for some references - lecture series, books/ any other materials",

        "text": "If you have the formula for the area of a circle pi*r^2 and differentiate it (with respect to r) you get 2*pi*r, the perimiter! If you have the volume of a cube 4/3*pi*r^3 and differentiate it, you get 4*pi*r^2 which is the surface area. \n\nIf you try this with a cube, lets say with side length s. The volume of such a cube is s^3, and you differentiate it to get... 3s^2, but that isn't the surface area. But if we try again and instead say the cube has sidelength 2t(=s), the formula of the volume with some t would be (2t)^3=8t^3, if we differentiate this we get 24t^2=6*4t^2=6*(2t)^2 -&gt; this is the formula for the surface area! If we do this again we get d/dt (24t^2) = 48t = 24(2t) which is the perimiter of the cube.\n\nIf we try this with another shape, let's say a cylender with height r and radius r (just so we have only one variable). The volume of a cylender is pi*r^2*h, with h=r the volume would be pi*r^3. If we differentiate this the volume would be 3pi*r^2. If we calculate what the surface area of such a cylender would be we get 2pir^2 (for the circle at the top and bottom) + 2pir*h (with h=r, the perimiter of the circle times the height) which is equal to 4pi*r^2. I've tried lots of variables but am yet to find one that works for the cylender. If you have t=(4/3)^(1/3)*r, you can get the surface area to work properly, but when you differentiate again you get a perimeter of 8pi*r instead of 4*pi*r (2pi*r for each circle circumference).\n\nSo my question's are, why does this work? Why does it only work on some shapes? Why does it only work with specific formulations of the area/perimeter/etc formula. (like with a square, using half the side length works but not the side length).",

Let's imagine the function is a pure one, in the sense that I can't use external inputs to compute it (e.g. can't use the current time or whatever)\n\nThe procedure would look like:\n\n1. Think of a number n.\n2. Mentally compute hash(n).\n3. Make a decision based on hash(n) % 2\n\nI'm basically looking for an easy-to-run PRNG.\n\nhash(n) should be uniformly distributed over its domain. It should also make it difficult for me to know ahead of time what the hash value would be. Do not assume n is uniformly distributed, as humans are bad at creating random numbers/sequences.\n\nThe example I ended up using was to compute the parity of the sum of digits of a random number.\n\nLike, I would think of 5218 and then see that 5+2+1+8 is even.\n\nI haven't experimentally checked to see if this generates a uniform distribution or what the ideal number length would be.",

        "text": "Hello everyone!  \nI was always intrigued by Cantor's work, and in general about the study of countability/uncountability of sets. \n\nReasoning a bit, I posed myself such question:  \n\n\nIf we take the power set of N, which we know has cardinality of the continuum, and remove all the infinite subsets of N from it (that is, the remaining set is the union of N, N\\^2, N\\^3, ...), is the resulting set countable?  \n\n\nI tried to follow 3 lines of reasoning, one for proving its countable, and two for proving its uncountable:\n\n1) To prove its countable, think of this set as the union of N, N\\^2, N\\^3, ... We know that these sets are all countables, and that the union of a countable amount of countable sets is also countable. Easy to see, how we have a countable amount of sets, and because they are all countable, it derives that their union is countable. The problem I have with my reasoning is that I'm not 100% sold on the fact that such a union is countable, even tough all the checkbox fill in.\n\n2)To prove its uncountable, take Q. As we know, Q and N have the same cardinality, so it derives that their Power set have the same cardinality. As we did before, remove all the infinite subsets of N from P(Q). Now we use the notion of Dedekind cuts and that Q is dense in R. From this, it derives that there is an injection from R to our set, and so our set must not be countable. Here, the problem is with removing the infinite subsets of N from P(Q): does this invalidate my argument? Should I remove instead all the infinite subsets of Q? \n\n3)Akin to the method in part 2, this time we remove from P(Q) all the infinite subsets of Q. Again, using Dedekind cuts and that Q is dense in R. We use the fact that the set of all irrational numbers is uncountable, and call this set I. Now, we define an injection from I to Q (which is a subset of P(Q)). Such an injection is, for every x in I, choose a random element in Q that's between x and the irrational number z such that z &lt; x and for all other irrational h in I such that h &lt; x, h &lt;= z. My problem with this is the fact that is there a notion of such z? Because it would be defined as the max of \\[0, x), which we know has no max element in R (and therefore in I).",

        "text": "I'm looking up [an estimate](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/average-life-insurance-rates) for a 25 year old male, 20 year policy for 500k of coverage. With average health, the monthly estimate is only $30/mo=$360/yr. \n\nIf I pull up [this actuarial table](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), it says the 1 year death probability for a 25M is 0.001507. But $500k\\*0.001507=$753.50. Meaning if I were to pay $753.50, it's a \"fair\" bet, but if I were to pay less than that, I'm making a +EV (expected value) bet and the insurance company is making a -EV bet. Then as time goes on, the price stays the same, but the odds become even more in my favor as the 1 year death rate goes up.\n\nI assume I am misunderstanding something. Can someone explain what I'm missing?",
