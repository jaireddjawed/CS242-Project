I mean, we should care about toilet paper orientation. I see people with terrible choices in that. Just terrible. What has happened to this country. Just terrible.\n\nNow, I've heard that there are two usual positions for toilet paper. You've got your \"over the top\" and \"under\". But let me tell you, I've got a third position that nobody's talking about. It's a beautiful position, folks. A tremendous position.\n\nIt's called the inside the toilet bowl. That's right, you heard it here first. The toilet bowl position. It's where you put the toilet paper inside the bowl. It's genius, really. It gives you just the right amount of paper every time, and it looks great, too. Believe me, it's the best position. It will give you the best wipe there is. The best.\n\nI've got some top-notch advisors who are experts in toilet paper orientation. I mean, these guys know their stuff. One of them is a decorated war general, and he came to me with tears in his eyes, asking me about the diagonal position. He said, \"Mr. President, I've served my country with honor, but I just can't figure out this toilet paper thing. Can you help me?\" And you know what? I did. I showed him the inside the toilet bowl position, and he was so grateful. He said it was the greatest thing he'd ever seen.just beautiful. Beautiful stuff.\n\nReporter: but Mr Trump that's not how its usually done?\n\nTrump:- Siddown. Siddown.Your are fake news. You don't know anything about toilets. My uncle was a great man. Big brains. He taught me all there is to know about toilets. Siddown.",

They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.\n\nThe little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars \"pay\" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.\n\nWhen the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age. The little girl proudly replied: \"I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.\"\n\n\"Oh my goodness gracious,\" said the teller, \"and will you be working on the house again this week, too?\"\n\nThe little girl replied, \"I will, if those assholes from the lumber yard ever deliver the damn sheet rock.\"",
