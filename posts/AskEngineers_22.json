It's a repoed home that was built 60 years ago and remodeled 20 ago. and it has two *huge* issues: it has a brook and a sanitary pipe both running through the left side of the property. The previous owner illegally built over both, with concrete, so it now houses a concrete driveway, a concrete garage, and half of the pool is on that side. This was built in the 20 years ago reno the second owners did and has only ever had 1 intervention, in front of the home the past 20 years. \n\nI'm aware it's a huge huge issue, but the kicker is the location: for us, it's 5 mins away from our jobs. Houses in the area are running 400-600K depending on size. The house is 718m2 and was appraised at 349K in its conditions, no kitchen, bathrooms etc. \n\nWe're offering 150K and we're currently in the process of the bank approving financing. But I'm not sure if we're literally out of our minds and this market has made me consider something so crazy. Any thoughts?",

The truck works by running it forward across the floor and the wheels keep turning and getting faster as you keep moving the truck forward. There is a sound like it is actually a little engine inside and it starts to whine when you move it too fast. The truck moves with a lot of speed and I think it has a mechanism that trades force for distance, but the speed that this thing moves is what is really confusing me because (though I haven’t made any kind of measurements or calculations) I think it has more speed and distance and torque in exchange for the force. If you try to stop the wheels while they are moving fast then there is a clicking sound like a ratchet is going the wrong way and all four wheels spin in almost unison but have a slight delay. The toy is made by Mattel and has 2001 on the bottom of the truck.",

But they ran into issues. I don't exactly understand the issues, but I got the impression like it had something to do with powder chemistry in the early 1900s, metallurgy of the cartridge cases and barrel manufacturing.\n\nThis made me wonder: Would it have been possible to fix the issues with 6mm Lee Navy? Could there have been cartridges with a caliber of 6mm and below in military service much earlier? Like say an alternate history where the Soviet Union skips 7,62x39mm and directly goes to 5,45x39mm in the late 1940s already?\n\nI've heard that the Swiss experimented with very small bore cartridges already around 1900. Where there reasons other than prevailing thought among the military brass for why something like that was not adopted earlier?",

I am finding it very hard to correlate processing conditions at one point of the process to finished product because downtime at various steps means it can take longer than 4 hours for product to go through the process. In addition operators are constantly changing processing conditions to keep things running which doesn't help.\n\nAre there any resources or books that can help me with structuring and analyzing my continuous process data?",

I can understand if it's more difficult to run thicker aluminum wires in places that may need maintenance or regular movement like a charging cable, but for electric motors it seems like a no brainer using a lighter amount of wire (if not slightly larger) than a heavier amount but slightly more compact.\n\nAluminum is less than a third as dense, less than a tenth the price per volume. At barely half the thermal and and more than half the electrical conductivity, it seems like doubling the wire area (which would only increase thickness by 23%) would still result in a 30% decrease in weight and an 80% decrease in cost. And in terms of strength, doubling the thickness should almost make up for the strength. Is it really 80% more expensive to wind aluminum or 23% less efficient for motor windings to be 23% less dense? Or have I screwed up my math somewhere?",

There's the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration equation, and that's great, but here's the catch: I'd like to find an equation for transpiration alone that can be used for a hydroponic or aquaponic system that houses the plants in a lid or raft. With this, the evapotranspiration calculation methods may become inaccurate because no soil or grow medium is present.\n\nWith Controlled Environment Agriculture growing the way it is, I think it would be super beneficial for everyone to have access to a common method of transpiration calculations, so any help is appreciated.",

This post is intended to provide an ongoing resource for job hunters to get an idea of the salary they should ask for based on location and job title. Survey responses are NOT vetted or verified, and should not be considered data of sufficient quality for statistical or other data analysis.\n\nSo what's the point of this survey? We hope that by collecting responses every quarter, job hunters can use it as a supplement to other salary data sites like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Glassdoor and PayScale to negotiate better compensation packages when they switch jobs.\n\n&gt; [Archive of past surveys](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/search/?q=flair%3A%22salary+survey%22&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;sort=new)\n\n## Useful websites\n\nFor Americans, BLS is the gold standard when it comes to labor data.

During the first day reporting, I told them (the company) that I was not interested in doing the internship at that department ,straightforwardly, without thinking. After talking to a senior person there, I found that I could work in this field in one of the researches. Although I still think I might not understand the technical part here.  I turned out to have offended my professor by saying the things I said on the first day there and that how I genuinely thought I should not be compromising when I'm not even getting paid good here (people don't get paid good or at all for internships in my country) (my monthly pay is going to be used up for my monthly taxi fare).\n\nI also turned out to have said to someone else in the workplace that what I'm doing might not be related to my studies but it has scope. I think I've messed up big time here. This is my first offline internship in the first four years of my degree. \n\nHow messed up do you think I am? Am I the worst intern ever possible?",

This has been bugging me for a while and I really want to make a 2nd version that can handle higher forces. So im thinking of making a few more and testing them to plastic deformation and/or total failure.   \n\n\nThe test method I'd like to use is to make a few identical shaft profiles and build a jig that rigidly holds the shaft in place at the handle. Then take a measured weighted rod attached to a pulley that will drop accurately from a defined distance above the tip of the blade portion of the sickle. I figure I should measure the deflection of the tip via slow-motion video capture as well.   \n\n\nAnyway is there any kind of standardized testing procedure for things like this? Would the result of this just be a standard impact force calculation to which I could say \"this sickle can handle x many joules of impact force\"? Are there other testing methods that would yield better outputs/insights?   \n\n\nSorry if this is a super basic question, I went to art school for industrial design and never took any engineering courses, but I really want to get a better grasp on the actual math behind these sorts of things.",

Last year he came with a new product he bought to lure the fishes to the hook/bait. Its a little plastic basket that hangs in front of the hook. Before you throw out you press some kind of dough into it. The dough will slowly disolve in the water and spread a nice flavor in the area of your hook.\n\nIt came with a form/mould to make the \"pressing-in\" process more reliable.   \n[https://www.hiki.de/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/be723d353c623cbb299d4ddec2f2b6b4/i/m/image.100023684\\_org.jpg](https://www.hiki.de/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/be723d353c623cbb299d4ddec2f2b6b4/i/m/image.100023684_org.jpg)  \nThis thing worked terrible and it became a running gag to curse on it :) At some point i a said: \"Until next year i will create you a stupidly over engineered perfect mould, which will work every time\"  \n\n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nSo here i am. having to desing a dough-moulder for so called \"method feeders\"...\n\nI created a 3d printed mould with a very flexible rubber inlay. The mould has a large opening in the bottom wich is aligned with the \"pusher\". When pressed from the bottom the pusher will lift the rubber inlay and dump/discharge anything thats in the mould.  \nThe pusher is mounted on 4 axis. \n\nHere is a image of the design:  \n[https://cloud.motey.org/apps/files\\_sharing/publicpreview/Go5piYg4LwWPy4B?file=/&amp;fileId=5349947&amp;x=2560&amp;y=1440&amp;a=true](https://cloud.motey.org/apps/files_sharing/publicpreview/Go5piYg4LwWPy4B?file=/&amp;fileId=5349947&amp;x=2560&amp;y=1440&amp;a=true)\n\nThe idea was that these axis will prevent the pusher from tilting and wegde into the frame.  \nThat did not work. As soon as i press slightly off center on the pusher it will tilt and wegde into the frame.\n\nLast night i lay in bed staring at the dark ceiling totaly disapointed by myself. I could not come up with one good or at least funny solution. at the same time i thought \" there must an easy standard solution to this. applied every day by thousand of engineeres...\"\n\nWhat is the most efficient improvement to prevent the pusher from tilting? \n\nWhat is the most over engineered/funny idea you can up with (that is still feasible with a 3d printer and hardware store/AliExpress material)?",

But what if you haven't completed those years and move to another country.? (Like loosing progress)\n\n\\-Which of these countries it would be easier to move around and document your job experiences that might be need for the chartership. Iam just asking because would one have to stay in a country for 7-8 years to get their chartership(maybe one could come back to that country so as to complete the years or the process but it would be easier if all experience is counted in or outside of the country):\n\n\\-moving between (Ireland+UK) &amp; australia\n\n\\-moving between Ireland &amp; the UK\n\n\\-moving between (Ireland+Uk) &amp; canada\n\n\\-Moving between Australia and Canada\n\n(Iam assuming canada has a different system (north american) and so if the chartership is not achieved then one cannot get an equivalent qualification in canada).\n\n\\-Also if you say that you dont loose progress and say for example I get 2 or 3 years in Ireland &amp; the UK then move to australia and get 4 experience there will I apply for chartership there or in ireland or Australia?

How do you stay creative with how you go about your work, and how does a good manager decided a deadline with out limiting innovation? Is there anything that you find comforting about knowing a deadline is coming that limits what routes you take in how you design something?",

        "text": "I saw a post with someone filling a small chip in their aquarium glass using an automotive UV resin kit and I had some questions about the use of UV resin, especially over a typical epoxy resin.\n\nMost windshield repairs are done with UV resins, which kinda confuses me with the little I know about resins. Isn’t UV resin prone to thermal and UV decay over long periods? So in an automotive case especially, wouldn’t that suggest an epoxy resin being a better choice? Or is that degradation mostly negligible? \n\nAre there different adhesive properties between the two when it comes to glass bondage? \n\nI guess my main questions are why would UV resin be used over an epoxy resin? And how strong (strength wise) is a resin repair on glass? I saw a paper on the loading of windshields near the edges with compressive loads averaging 14.9MPa and tensile loads averaging ~4MPa. Granted the repair sites of the windshield are quite small, especially if no cracking has occurred but those are pretty significant loads.",

        "text": "I would like to get better at mental math. I’m noticeably worse at quickly comprehending on the fly calculations, and abstract math concepts than my peers. I did some googling and most of the stuff I found was either way too dumbed down, or not focused on purely mental math (like numeric reasoning tests). \n\nAn example of what I’m talking about: today at work I had a 2D data structure with, for the sake of discussion, random data in it. I was taking the mean along one dimension then the max across the remaining dimension, and comparing that to the absolute max (the max of dimension 1 followed by dimension 2). The results were a bit confusing because sometimes the value of result 2 (the absolute max) was lower than the max of the means. Now that I’m typing it out, I can see that something is erroneous in how I was pulling out those maxes since that can’t be, but I really confused myself in the moment questioning if the data itself was wrong or if it was possible to get such a result. \n\nThat is just one example of a type of problem I would like to be able to reason out in my head in a few seconds instead of a few minutes. \n\nI actually tutored math for a while until recently and my students were almost always faster at mental math than me. I guess for just simple addition/multiplication that is easy to practice. But for more complex and nuanced thinking like my example above, I’m not sure what to focus on practicing. Any pointers would be appreciated, I’m sure something has to exist like that. \n\nSometimes I feel like the dumbest smart person in the world and question how I got to where I am XD.",
