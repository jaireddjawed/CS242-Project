This same experience can push those close to them away from religion. \n\nMy personal example is when my father was injured in Afghanistan, and eded up losing both legs below the knee. I was raised religious and was pretty devout. My parents split when I was young and my dad was always noticeably less religious. After he was injured he slowly became more religious. He is certainly not an evangelical by any means but has definitely started going to church more than he did before (which was previously maybe once a year with other family members). \n\nThis event started putting doubts in my mind about god and the \"good\" of religion. I went through all the \"how could god do this to me?\" type thoughts. Eventually I became an atheist, largely due to this experience and the thoughts it led me to.\n\nI recently have been thinking about how the experience had opposite effects on our beliefs/practices. Anyone have any thoughts or experiences similar to this and care to share?",

None of that has anything to do with atheism, it just explains my situation better.If you don't click on the link, I suggest you read this- \n\nLink Tl;Dr: Dad got unlucky and was caught in some dirty stuff on Father's Day. Parents will divorce and now I am 1,000 miles away living just a some miles away from Louie Gohmert's Office.\n\nNow onto the important business; Since I became an atheist two years ago, I have not been around my extended family and as such I have not seen any of these people in my new perspective. It has been torture.\n\nMy grandmother frequents, or at least proclaims she frequents, whatever Southern Baptist church that contains a certain pastor she has known for a few decades. She almost worships him more than Jesus.\n\nShe has always included me as her favorite, and now she has brought the Bible more into her life than she did before. This is probably due to the state of her family. Her son alienated her as a member of his family, daughter is supposedly being an entire bitch and they don't talk anymore, and her second husband died not that long ago.\n\nAnyway, she is entirely aware of what happened and decided to bring two books to the table. Obviously, the Bible along with [The Bible Promise Book]( http://www.amazon.com/Bible-Promise-Book-International-Version/dp/1557481768/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=). She attempted to explain why my parents marriage was failing, acting like I was a 8 year old or something (Probably because she is aware of my high-functioning Asperger's Syndrome and is going through Dementia). She pulled out a few verses detailing the structure of marriage, in God's way.\n\nOver time I had enough of the contradictions, hate, and absolute unawareness to what actually made the marriage break apart that I spoke in and commented. Marriage was not created by God, that's why other religions support it, besides marriage was if anything powered by mutual love and not the religious feelings.\n\nYes homosexuality is genetic, when the hell did you chose to be heterosexual? Besides, I tried watching gay porn, it does not work on me. Besides King James was homosexual, don't give me your one-sided opinion. \n\nShe continued on about how Southern Baptism is not Protestant or Catholic and how Methodists is a form of Catholic as opposed to Baptists, how men should lead the marriage (Which is what exactly ruined my parents to begin with, letting my Dad take control over finances and my mother's time and car)\n\nI let it out, I demanded to see whatever sources she had for it. Only revealing a small book written by her pastor. Great. It even lists everything not Baptism as cults. Ironic.\n\nI continued this argument, trying to get it through her head that the Bible is not the answer, that it has been edited so many times that it is not longer Gods word. This was the best I could do, I could not risk letting her find out of my atheism, I had to continue to play the Methodist for risk of having my uncertain amount of time her be complete torture.\n\nIt hurt me how happy she was to say so many hateful things, so many evil and wrong things.\n\nWhat I need is some advice, should I go out and confront her more about this? Be more relaxed throughout my stay and overall just be isolated on this trip.\n\nOr should I go and be quiet about this and be more tolerant of others while I am at a more religious part of America.",

        "text": "When I was young and still a Christian I just assumed everyone was also unless there were clear indications they weren't, and I was always surprised to find out if they weren't.  Of course, now I know that obviously not everyone I meet is Christian.  However, in a reversal of sorts, I've found myself somewhat surprised to find out when someone *is* religious.  Two cases come to mind, two different lapses in critical thinking in which I assumed someone was irreligious.\n\nIn one case, there is a girl with whom I go to school, and I've thought about asking her out on a dinner date.  She's quirky and definitely not a \"goody-two-shoes\" kind of person, so when she posted a status about how much she loves God I was surprised.  In this case, my conclusion is that because I liked her I hoped that she wasn't religious.  While it isn't a deal-breaker, I admit that it's a more of a turn-off the more religious they are.\n\nIn the other case, it came up in conversation with one of my favorite professors that she attends church on a very regular basis.  Usually my favorite profs are the religious studies or philosophy teachers, and so they're very open about their religious beliefs and have very good reasoning behind their belief (or disbelief, as is most often the case out of the professors I know).  Anyway, this professor of which I speak is a music professor, so religious belief never came up before.  I think I had assumed she was irreligious because a) she is very no-nonsense business-like, so I had never had a conversation like this with her before, and b) because I had conflated my respect of a professor with the qualities I valued, including lack of belief (or at least very critically thought-through beliefs).  Perhaps in her case she *has* thought very critically about her belief, but it wasn't the focus of the conversation and I didn't feel it was my place to keep on that subject.\n\nSo, has anyone else found themselves in a situation like that?  What caused that?  And I'm welcome to discussing my two cases if you're curious about anything.\n\nPS: I absolutely love this community.  While I'm still subscribed for the occasional worthwhile blog/news link, /r/atheism is so much of the same posts and comments on repeat.  It's awesome to be able to discuss topics in depth in a forum like this.  Thanks everyone!",

        "text": "Currently, I'm married going on three years this August (will be together for ten in August as well). My wife is a Christian and I was, as well, prior to and after we were wed. Last night, we had a discussion on religion and how it affects us and our family. \n\nI've only accepted myself as an atheist this year, and I subtly explained to her the reasoning for my personal beliefs. Clearly, it upset and changed her perception of me. The notion of having someone designed for you and dedicating yourself to only one person is something that she holds dear, which makes this all the more difficult.\n\nShe's firm in her beliefs and, throughout the night, I had to reiterate that I want our marriage to last and me being this way isn't going to make me think any less of you or your values. It's hard to have her be openminded about this specific topic since it goes against her beliefs.\n\nLong story short, she gave a possibly ultimatum: if I'm serious about my convictions, then our marriage isn't going to work because of us not being one household under God. I explained that we can make this work, but she's firm on that notion. I haven't told my immediate family as yet, all of which are very religious, sans my brother, but I'm unable to get through to him at the moment and I'm lost. \n\nThe wife's away at school for a few hours, and I need to vent and talk to someone who isn't going be sarcastic and belittle every comment that doesn't sit right with them. I would rather things be out in the open now, rather than a few years down the line with kids being involved.\n\nAny advice or takeaways on how I can get proceed with this sensitive issue? Thanks.\n\n**EDIT**: It should go without saying, but I appreciate what each of you have had to say. Thanks for your words and understanding. Any additional bits of advice goes a long way.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Long day and night yesterday. She opened up a bit more, then became more emotional, and then settled down and we talked into the night. She's still not trying to relate, and her glares and reluctance to want to look and be around me isn't helping. We spoke again this morning and I can see she's making baby steps. Thanks everyone for those passages. She asked to view them, so that's a step in the right direction. Right now, we're apart in different rooms since it looks like she needs more time to herself.\n\n**EDIT 3**: After our morning to afternoon discussion, she needed that time to herself. According to her, and from the looks of it, she was chatting with a pastoral counselor when we were apart. Only afterwards was her mood suddenly more upbeat and more like her usual self. I don't know how to feel about this, since I've been butting against a wall for the past few days, pouring everything out, to get her to understand and one hour (maybe?) away and talking to someone else made her more openminded?\n\nWe talked again and she basically said that she loves me and that she'll be praying for me that I turn things around and remain openminded. While it isn't a possibility that I'll be going back into religion, I think she means well. Long story short, we chatted, she'll pray for me, her parents need to know (for what, I don't know or care since there's mutual dislike) and my parents need to know. All I'm hoping is that she doesn't try to push religion onto me whenever she has the chance. I came back home today to find a Bible atop my laptop, which bugs me but I'll let go for the time being. \n\nEven so, I think my mom is going to take it worse since my brother and I are now the same, and we're her only children. Obviously, the last thing I want to do is hurt her, and being that I'm across the country from her, I'd feel better having a talk face-to-face with her than over the phone. Thanks again everyone for your help in getting through the storm. Here's hoping things settle down a bit, so she has more time to let it settle.\n\n**EDIT 4**: Not sure how much of these I'll do, but just wanted to update since some things have changed. The week after our first discussion (this past week), I've been seeing more religious objects around the house. Three new crosses, one hanging in the den, the bedroom, and the bathroom. This is in addition to her getting a cross bracelet. Since this came out, she hasn't worn her ring either. \n\nI haven't brought it up to her, thinking that this is exactly what she expects me to do. Tonight she made some offhand comments about people going down the wrong path that leads to nowhere at the end, and about not having a purpose in life. Clearly, these were directed at me, and if this is will be her usual tone because I'm not aligning myself with her beliefs, then we'll be arguing more than enjoying this marriage.",

I still have a few questions about atheism as a mode of thought, however. \n\nThere is a lot of pseudoscience in the world, which we can quite thoroughly accept. Therefore, what is the best way to react when somebody talks about ghosts, an afterlife, that weird 'spiritual vibration' thing that's going around in new age books, and other ideas like this.\n\nThere's no way to actively disprove them that I can think of, and I don't know how I can philosophically disprove the idea of a ghost, or the idea of Chakras, for example. Is there anything in atheism as a mode of thought to deal with these issues in a rational, evidence based manner? \n\nThis is one thing that I'm still slightly conflicted with about Atheism, because as an idea it's simply the lack of belief in a deity, which doesn't account for the idea of 'spirituality'. \n\nFor example, how could I rationally argue against a friend's idea of Chakras. Physically, in their description, it's atoms in your body vibrating at different frequencies for each chakra. I know from physics that all atoms are vibrating, very fast, and electrons are rapidly moving around the nucleus. Has there been any thorough scientific evidence to prove the uniformity of frequency of atoms in the body?\n\nAlso, ghosts and the afterlife. I regularly hear anecdotal descriptions of people seeing ghosts, etc. However, there's no way to logically test anecdotal evidence. \n\nIf there are any good studies on these matters I would love to read them. Otherwise, how do you all deal with these ideas?",

We were honored and said yes.\n\nHowever, he doesn't know I've completely lost my faith (I haven't come out to anyone but my wife and one friend).  \n\nIn the Catholic tradition, a Godparent is a very important figure that is supposed to guide the child in the way of faith, especially if something should happen to the parents.  It isn't just an honorary/special title, as it is in many circles.  \n\nPart of me thinks I have to let him know that I can't raise the kid to be a good Catholic, or really help in in that realm at all.  I certainly would feel pretty bad about getting up in front of a bunch of people, re-affirming a faith I don't subscribe to anymore, and then lying about what I'll do to \"uphold and protect\" the faith.   However, that doesn't mean I won't do everything to help the kid to become a good person, to be safe, to love him/her if anything happened to the parents, etc etc.\n\nHe's my best friend, and I think this may sever our close relationship.  I know, that doesn't make it right, but I've been best pals with this guys since I was five.  I'm not sure I can face it.  Advice would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I'm looking to start a discussion on faith and atheism. A little background on myself: I was raised Muslim but my parents never forced me to follow it but i create the image that i'm a believer to my relatives back home. I live in Canada now and i've been an atheist for about 10 years since i was 13. i still fast during ramadan though and religious places(mosques, churches) have always been a place of comfort for me. \n\nNow, onto the point of this discussion. Lately, i've been feeling something that i haven't allowed myself to feel and that thing is faith. Not faith in a religion or god or anything like that but faith in the universe. Kinda like believing in chaos. Anything that happens, happens but i will believe that things will work out for the best even though i have no proof that they will. \n\nI'm not sure how to describe it but ever since i've allowed myself to believe in something, i've been happier, which is surprising to me. This led me down some strange thought pathways where i've come to the conclusion that the difference between myself and theists is that their faith comes with rules and expectations and their faith points to some godlike being while mine doesn't. And looking at other religions and their versions of god, i find that the boundary between myself and theists is becoming more blurred.\n\nI've always heard that faith is necessary in life and i've always understood that faith in something better is one of the main reasons that people in need turn to religion. I never thought i was one to have faith because i came from a pretty cushy upbringing and never had a reason to have faith in anything, but so far i'm feeling pretty happy having faith in something. \n\nand i want to see what you all think. Is it possible for an atheist to have faith in something other than themselves or should i start calling myself something else. I'm starting to see a lot of parallels between me having faith and \"gods\" in religions. and aside from the weird rules and restrictions(and occasional hate) they exhibit, i wonder if it's the same thing.",

        "text": "My thoughts on the evolution of religion, and where we're likely headed next (in the West and Middle East, at least).\n\n--Anthropologists seem to agree that hunter-gatherer societies held generally vague supernatural beliefs that is summed up as \"sky god\". The details varied, but by and large hunter-gatherer clans seem to have believed in some form of higher magical force that created them. Sky god, if you will.\n\n--As humans gathered into towns, then cities, then empires, their lives became more messy and confusing, with different roles ascribed to different individuals. These earliest societies projected this understanding to the heavens, thus the \"gods\" were born. Sky god was just too vague.\n\n--Time progresses, and polytheism becomes too bizarre and convoluted -- too many gods doing too many weird things, a soap operatic pantheon that just became too unbelievable for increasingly sophisticated societies.  Something had to replace it.\n\n--Enter the Hebrews, originally polytheists who later settled on just one god among the several that they earlier subscribed to (borrowed from the Canaanites, just as the Romans took their pantheon from the Greeks). Yahweh becomes a \"one true god\", clean and simple (at least more so than polytheism).\n\n--Christianity and Islam ran with it. Numerous sects of these develop.\n\n--Today, thanks to globalization, modern societies see Christians, Jews, Muslims, Jains, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists and agnostics etc. etc. all rubbing shoulders and bouncing off one another. The younger generations see this and view this mess in much the same way as the more advanced polytheistic societies of the past did -- too much noise and confusion. Thus, the current rise of the \"nones\".\n\n--Will the nones become atheists?  Perhaps, but not before they adhere to what I call \"sky thing\".\n\nWhat is it? Depends on who you ask. It can be a \"spirituality\", a \"force\", an \"essence\", a \"something\" or \"anything\" or what have you. Each unique to the individual, in a way. It's everywhere and nowhere, and will probably be very difficult to argue people out of.\n\nUnfortunately too many nones are also scientifically illiterate, so they'll jump in on sky thing (whether it's New Age, Deepak, yoga spirituality, or something different entirely) before they (hopefully) come to appreciate that the best method for finding true knowledge and understanding is the scientific one.\n\nI could be wrong of course, but my current thinking is that sky thing will be the next step humanity takes in the evolution of belief. It is what it is.\n\nTL;DR -- Sky thing is coming. Be afraid!\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hey guys, I came up with an argument against the Christian idea of hell (the typical idea of eternal torture) and morals and I wanted you guys to see of you can find holes in it so I can figure out if it is sound or not. \n\nHere is how the argument would go. \n\nHell is an infinite punishment given to a finite crime. This in itself is incredibly unjust because by definition the crime could not possibly deserve the punishment, no matter how heinous. The only crime that could possibly deserve an infinite punishment would be an infinitely bad crime (theoretically of course, no such a thing could possibly exist). \n\nLet me make an assertion as a preface to my next point: taking out the fact that a real number cannot actually be compared to infinity as infinity is not a number, the number one and the number one billion are an equal distance from infinity. They both have exactly the same amount separating them from an infinite amount. In this sense, telling a white lie and the attempted genocide of the Jews both are exactly the same distance from this theoretical infinitely bed crime. \n\nSo according to typical Christian theology, telling a lie makes you just as bad as Hitler, at least from the stance of how deserving you are of punishment. Ironically, this means Christianity advocates exactly what apologists say atheism would entail: a world where there is no difference between lying and murder. A world where no one can say that one crime is worse than the other. \n\nThoughts? Two objections I'm aware of are that even though they are just as far from infinite, the number one is still far less from one billion, and that hell is not a punishment, but rather a consequence. I have arguments for both, but I would like to know if there is any logical issues with my argument before I would even attempt to flesh them out. \n\nEdit: feel free to call me an idiot. I literally just had this thought and wanted to share. It is possible there is a huge leap in logic that I haven't thought of and if so by all means, pick it apart. ",

        "text": "I live in western India, and on 20th June, a very peculiar religious activity began in my town. The Palkhi. Before i begin, i would like to clarify one thing. My post is not some sort of debate on whether religion is good or bad, it is just to tell about the good experience had by me as an observer, and most people have who take part in it. It is a religious activity by 'religion' that has not lost all contacts with humanity. When I say 'religion', I don't imply a certain narrow belief system, but the entire cultural package which calls this place home.\n\n[A photograph not taken by me.](https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/amitshrikulkarni/5950500777/) The palkhi is a religious procession, a pilgrimage wherein people simply walk from one a certain holy place to a destination holy place. On their way, they sing, play instruments, dance, chant the names of their beloved saints and gods, and have a great time, often with strangers they have never met before. Although anyone can take part in this procession, the sect which predominantly takes part in this procession are the [Warkaris]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varkari ), a type of Bhakti sect whose religious ways are similar to Sufism, with more emphasis on Love towards God and modesty than religious rituals. \n\nTwo 'palkhis' began around 20th June this year, and the people walk about 230 kilometers (~140 miles), which takes about a month. One  Palkhi sets out in the name of saint Dnyaneshwar, another in the name of saint Tukaram. Tukaram lived 400 years ago, Dnyaneshwar 800 years ago, and both are greatly respected for their efforts in fighting religious dogma and stale authority, and sort of bringing 'God' closer to people directly, eliminating middlemen like priests, and emphasising on moral cleansing and innocent compassion rather than elaborate rituals. \n\nWhat begins as a gathering of people makes an impact on many other things. The saints, to whom this Palkhi is a homage, were known for their broadminded views, and the Palkhi reflects that. People leave their home behind and take a journey towards a holy town with a bag of clothes and like minded people. Your 'caste' or wealth ceases to matter because people are equally 'poor', wearing simple clothes and walking by foot. Certain Muslim communities too take part in the palkhi, because people in the region love and respect these saints irrespective of the religion in question, and even Muslims sing songs praising these saints and the local dieties, often with more zeal than some of us urban hindu folks. Religious barriers and wealth lose importance, and it becomes a month long experience of being humbled.\n\nI mentioned that the people set out with a bag of clothes. What about food? As the Palkhi passes from various villages and towns, the people of those towns, often temples and communities, make it their duty to offer meals to the Warkaris or the procession participants. People see it as their way of taking part in the Palkhi since they can not actually 'take part' in it due to family responsibilities. In many places, medical assistance is also planned for the ones who may have fallen sick, and all this is provided as a service, mostly for free. Thousands of people are provided food and aid throughout the town. Having worked at such a food serving outlet as well as volunteering help during medical checkup camps, it is very humbling to be able to serve these hungry and thirsty travellers food while they are singing songs and playing their instruments keeping their 'holy' atmosphere alive. They are strangers, but in some ways, not strangers. Many give us blessings for the food they eat, since in Hinduism, food is equated with Brahma, the highest God. The emotional emphasis of this experience is very touching, even for me, being an atheist myself.\n\nPeople have inconvenience sometimes, since certain main roads are closed completely for the day when the Palkhi passes through a town. At the end of the day, the participants are taking part in it for religious purification, and divine blessings from their Gods or saints. But the way these guys do it is amazing. The fact that Hindus and Muslims can come together and sing praise of the same saints says a lot about the maturity of the religious goals in the activity. Having grown up in a family with close ties to the Warkaris, I have found their ways really beautiful. This is something I have loved about the Warkari interpretation of Bhakti, because it works as an excuse to bring people closer and make yourself more humble, rather than create hatred. Tukaram and Dnyaneshwar are two people who have had long lasting impacts on religion here, and strived to keep religious philosophy rather clean and humble. In a country like India where you can not easily separate religion and culture, movements which try to bring people closer together do a dificult task of bridging many barriers. This nearly 1000 year old pilgrimage strives to do this, and is kind of awesome to be a part of, however small mine was. I believe this is one side of religion everyone should know about, and should be encouraged until the world is mature enough to let go of religion altogether. \n\nSorry if this is too long or in the wrong sub, but this is one experience I wished to share! Other religion forums are rather inactive, and /r/trueatheism has a mature audience. Thanks for reading!",

        "text": "I see things like this nearly every day on social media: \"Awful thing happened to me or someone I care about.  Please send prayers!\"... and then a gaggle of people will respond that they're praying for them and I'm almost CERTAIN most of them really do.  That amount of stupidity and the willing suspension of logic that goes along with it is truly hard to swallow at times.  For that person's request of others to make sense, there would have to be an omnipotent being out there somewhere that's powerful enough to change outcomes with a mere thought that knows all and hears all.  That being either purposely thought, \"Yeah, fuck you, here's a huge pile of shit in your life because I don't feel like helping you avoid it,\" or he apparently lacked the cognitive abilities to protect ALL harm from coming to his followers but will hear petitions if there are enough filed for one cause or another.  That deity has frequently heard a cacophony of prayers for causes near and dear to people, and when the outcomes didn't change for the better those people merely shrugged it off and prayed for the next cause.  Those people think (I guess) that God is only *so* powerful and can only fix things he's made aware of after missing them in the first place?  They beg for favor like in \"Clash of the Titans\" and would watch the same movie and shrug off its absurdity.  They would watch horribly unfortunate things happen to the most religious of people and just assume that there's some greater purpose to Jimmy eating his food through a straw the rest of his life and likely never managing to say his own name after a drunk driver hit him.\n\nAnd all along, those same asinine people could have that reality shoved in their face, laid out clearly and succinctly for them, and deny it.  Even though it shapes their entire lives and wastes hours/days/months/years of their lives engaging in prayer and other religious activities, they don't bother to ever wonder if it's real at all.  And we live in a world where the vast majority of humans believe it.  The vast majority - our politicians, their donors, their campaign workers - make decisions that affect you and me based on ridiculous nonsense.  A religious doctor sees a miraculous recovery from cancer and rather than finding the completely reasonable explanation that could cure the world of cancer, they dismiss it as a divine miracle and rob us all of the discovery.  They spend their lives denying science that conflicts with their belief system so they ignore global warming because denying science that would cause them discomfort is second nature to them.\n\nI'm sure some in this subreddit would say it's wrong to judge others, but how can you not?  My opinion of someone I otherwise thought intelligent that tells me they go to Church every Sunday is IMMEDIATELY lessened.  If someone says they'll pray for me, I make the same logical assessment I made at the beginning of this post and I pity them.  Luckily I can block these feelings of pity and futility out the vast majority of the time (or I fear my life would be truly difficult), but I wonder if I'm the only one here that finds themselves feeling extremely small and surrounded by stupidity from time to time.  On the flip side, when a real person tells me to my face that they're an atheist, it's one of the most uplifting feelings I've ever had.  Sometimes I need that to remember that I'm not alone.\n\nSorry for the long post and for posting something that probably is obvious in a subreddit like this, but religion is really encroaching on my happiness today and it's something I've wanted to ask for a long, long time of other atheists.",

        "text": "Epicureanism is commonly used to mean a connoisseur of the arts, food, wine, etc but it actually is an ancient Greek philosophy. From Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. \n\n&gt;Following Aristippus—about whom very little is known—Epicurus believed that what he called \"pleasure\" is the greatest good, but the way to attain such pleasure is to live modestly and to gain knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of one's desires. This led one to attain a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear, as well as absence of bodily pain (aponia). The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism, insofar as it declares pleasure to be the sole intrinsic good, its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from \"hedonism\" as it is commonly understood.\"\n\nI think this understanding of the universe aligns with that of many materialist atheists here. Atheists are generally skeptical of superstition and divine intervention. While Epicureans were not explicitly atheistic (more agnostic/deistic leaning by today's understanding, they acknowledged the strong possibility of a deistic god but rejected all Earthly understanding, communication and intervention from that being)\n\n In addition, I think that the philosophy is on the right track. The best way to live life is seeking comfort and pleasures in moderation, always seeking to improve yourself. It requires a balance of effort and relaxation, etc. Overall, very impressive for a moral system in 300 BC.\n\nThe Epicureans were very supportive of scientific approaches as well. 2300 years ago they knew that the Earth was round, disease was caused by tiny creatures that were transmitted through filth/dirt and that the universe was constructed of atoms.\n\nWhy doesn't this perspective get more attention in atheist circles? In my view it is a stronger and superior philosophy than Zen Buddhism, which gets brought up and supported a lot.",

But I have been thinking lately, I plan on doing the whole Santa and Easter Bunny thing.  It's harmless.  There is a good moral to it, that doing good is rewarded and being bad is not.  But do I tell him(and I have a daughter on the way too!) that Heaven is real, following what the bible teaches?  Keep that up until he is old enough to understand, and only then tell him(what I believe to be) the truth to be.  Much like Santa.  Of course I will always preface everything I say with \"You need to decide for yourself...but this is what I believe to be true...\"  I know for a fact I will not ever tell him HELL is real.  Or probably even that any of the stories literally happened.  But on the topic of Heaven...I'm leaning towards telling him it's real until a certain age when I just simply divulge what I believe.  Maybe a bit of wordplay would be able to portray that heaven may be real, good people are rewarded and death is not scary. \n\nIt's a hard topic.  I don't like the idea of ever being dishonest to my child.  But I don't want them to have to face the harsh realities so early in life when they don't need to be worrying about those things yet.  Just wanted to see what others think and practice.\n\nEDIT: I feel I should clarify.   I by no means want to teach him Christian heaven and theology.   I meant heaven in terms of any religion,  just a good place you go when you die.   Starting to unlean now though. I got a few years to decide. ",

        "text": "I've always held the belief that horoscopes and astrology held no merit. I find it hard to swallow, the idea that the orientation of stars at one's birth could somehow affect one's personality and even life.\n\nThat being said, I've been talking to a friend who believes strongly in horoscopes etc. They said that some horoscopes were legitimate - for example, several events that were predicted in their horoscope for them month did occur on the dates that they were \"supposed\" to occur. It's not like they went out actively trying to prove it right - they checked afterwards.\n\nMy response to that would be that it's likely confirmation bias, and that they only remembered the times it did work. However, there's still a niggling in the back of my mind.\n\nenough said by me. \n\nWhat's your take on horoscopes?\n\n If you think they're legit, why? If not, why?",

This side of it is saying we can dismiss the claims of religion because of the obvious human hand in their creation.\n\nJust as an idle question, I'm wondering which of the two you all tend to be more interested in. I suppose from an abstract sense, the Dawkins approach is more complete and useful, but I really, really like the Hitchens approach. I've read the holy books, I love studying the anthropology of the religions and picking apart the writings and the people who wrote them. Learning of the timeline of the gospels' creation and the discrepant accounts, or the methods by which schisms erupted in Islam even before there was an Islam, is just fascinating.\n\nWhat about you guys?\n\nEDIT: I'm liking the discussion, guys, but \"all of them\" is evading the question, LOL. \n\nEDIT 2: Still not quite there, so quoting /u/czah7.\n\n&gt;I feel like a lot of people here missed the question.

Gods, depending on one's definition, could exist beyond our universe, and not interfere with our universe.

        "text": "title, basically. I was talking with him and this is what came up. Basically, he believes the number one reason that people don't constantly do horrible things to each other is because they are afraid of the consequence. If the consequence is non existent, then there is no reason that people wouldn't kill everyone. His example: If you find a nameless man out in the desert with $500 on him, if there was no god/you don't believe in one, why wouldn't you kill him, take his money and bury him in the sand without a second thought?\" I argued that empathy is a hardcoded part of the human psyche, but he then brought up atrocities such as the Rwandan genocide, or the Nazi holocaust. Essentially, he argues that \"inherent good\" doesn't exist in humans, and the only reason that we wouldn't do horrible things is that we are afraid we will get caught and punished. Religion (and he made it clear that it could be any religion, not just christianity) provides a consequence regardless of circumstance; God (or whatever you believe in) is watching, and you will be punished by god in the future, either later in life or in the afterlife.\n\nNow, I have a good relationship with my father and I don't want to make any kind of argument like \"Wow, if the only reason you aren't killing people is because you're afraid of punishment then that makes you a pretty messed up person!\" against him as a person, I don't want to harm the relationship and i am positive that if I did argue that point he would just say \"why does that make me a messed up person? where do you derive that sense of morality from?\"\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nEDIT: alright well i guess a bunch of you guys didn't read what i said about \"not wanting to strain my good relationship with my father\" and are all harping about how he must be a crazy psychopath and i better murder him for my own good or some stupid shit. For the last 8 hours my inbox has been constantly going off with people telling me to KILL my father. What the fuck? He creates a theoretical, I post about it and i have a bunch of fucking armchair internet psychologists telling me that my father is a psychopath and i should be afraid of him.\n\nfuck",

        "text": "I posted earlier about [my material](https://googledrive.com/host/0B6E6Za3m4m2VRTZURVk3ZUdEUVE)  We had the debate last night...it went like this.\n\n&gt;Me: The earth and universe are so old because of all these scientific evidences.\n\n&gt;Dad: Scientists have been wrong, you put a lot of faith in man son.  I put my faith in God.\n\nHe did admit that he might be wrong, maybe it is that old.  He may come around eventually on this one.\n\n&gt;Me: Noah's Ark didn't happen because of all these evidences.  And the fact nobody has ever found the Ark even though we \"know\" where it's at.\n\n&gt;Dad: While I agree many miracles required it to happen, they have found evidence of the Ark.  I don't know the story, but it happened.\n\nHe is a following of Ken Ham, unfortunately.  So he believes all that malarky.  The fact that they still spout out circumstantial evidence that proves it's true keeps the faith going no matter what.\n\n&gt;Me: God is evil because he did some nasty things in the bible.\n\n&gt;Dad:  He's God.  He's allowed to do what he wants.  He created us, he can destroy us.  Who are we to question?\n\nAn unacceptable answer to me.  Though he did admit some things felt harsh and evil. (God destroying Davids son because David committed a crime, etc)\n\n&gt;Me: What about all the contradictions?\n\n&gt;Dad:  They aren't.  They are either all taken out of context, or the words used are not interpreted correctly, or the translation from greek/hebrew/latin to english is not perfect.\n\nHe did actually explain a few contradictions that I felt were an adequate explanations.  But that was like 2 out of a 100.  (The lineage of Joseph is explained via them using Mary's lineage the second time.  It makes sense.)\n\n&gt;Me:  How can you explain other religions having personal experiences of their God, but they are all wrong and you are right?\n\n&gt;Dad:  Their stories are often times silly.  Mary on a piece of toast?  How we do know they aren't faking it?\n\nUnacceptable answer.\n\n&gt;Me: What about Hell, how is that justifiable?\n\n&gt;Dad: Honestly, I don't believe in Hell either.  I don't tell my Christian friends that, but I agree it doesn't seem right.  And it says many places in the bible the unbelievers will perish.\n\nSo he believes Christians go to heaven, heathens just die.  Or at least are not eternally tormented.  That's one bright spot.  Too bad I was taught differently my whole life\n\n\n* \"We don't understand God\"\n* \"You must have faith in God and the bible not man and his flawed science.  Science has been wrong A LOT\"\n* \"God can do what he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants\"\n\nSo yes, my debate was rather infuriating.  \n\nWe didn't really have a chance to touch on evolution much.  I said we can have a whole new debate just about that topic.\n\nObviously there is a whole lot more to it.  We talked for 5hours.  He didn't do much but be on the defensive.",

        "text": "Hi guys.  I see a lot of personal experiences posted on this subreddit and I want to give you an anecdote about a side you probably have never heard from.  I'm going to share my experiences as a first generation Chinese immigrant to Canada and how religion changed my parents for the worst.\n\nMany Chinese Christian communities are quite \"extreme\" in the sense that they are much more traditionalist and literal in their interpretations.  While I have found that many do not really take the rites and rituals of Christianity seriously (e.g. religious holiday traditions), they are much more obsessive over doctrine and the text.  Ethnic Chinese communities in the west are actually quite fractured due to cultural and political differences, and religion is one of the things that is able to unite us.  Sick of isolation, my parents, like many other Chinese immigrants joined a religious group in an attempt to fit in.\n\nAs the years went on, my parents became more indoctrinated by the church's doctrine and by the doctrine of TV preachers they watch.  The most startling thing I started to notice was how they were becoming intolerant about things which they used to be supportive or indifferent about (e.g. LGBT rights and other religions).  During Toronto's gay pride parade, by parents lambasted LGBT and their supporters as freaks and trash (rough translation), and during our Sunday brunch, church family friends actually called gay people punishment for parents who sin.  It went so far that during my visits back to Hong Kong and China, they refused to enter any Buddhist and Taoist sites as they viewed them as blasphemous.  During one visit back, my parents lashed out at my grandparents over a spat on Chinese religions, and they have never been back since.\n\nI am now 22 and going to school in the US.  During my time in college, I discovered I was bisexual, and became atheist because of a plethora of factors that mainly deal with my interest in science, LGBT rights, and feminism.  I currently have a tenuous and strained relationship with my parents, and if I break to them that I'm atheist and bisexual, I know for sure I will be disowned.  This fact used to make me feel so helpless and isolated, and at times I just want to cry and wonder how this could have happened.  Now, I think it might be most beneficial if I just completely cut them out of my life forever.  I have seen how doctrine and zeal can influence people and lead them to bigotry, and whenever Christians derail discussions on LGBT and religion by going like \"NO NO, RELIGION DOESN'T MAKE THEM BAD. PEOPLE ARE BAD. WAAAHHH ATHEISTS ARE SO MEAN\", I can't help but feel frustrated that they are invalidating my (and countless atheists') experiences just because their religious feelings are hurt.\n\nThank you for reading.  I would also appreciated if anyone could tell me if I should even bother mending my relationship with my parents and if there is any hope in them mellowing down.  Though I don't regularly post, I am happy to clarify anything you guys are curious about.\n\nEdit: Since I got a PM asking why I'm asking this question and trying to play internet detective with me (atheists are all liars see!): here's the answer.  I'm once again at a crossroad in my life.  I recently graduated college and am going to go to med school in another city.  I don't know if I should tell my parents and that's why this predicament came up.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/283izh/argument_with_the_wife_about_evolution_again_just/",
        "text": "**TL;DR - another fight with the wife about evolution, i'm not out and it's very frustrating.**\n\nSo - the quick background is that i'm an atheist who hasn't told anyone yet, and my wife is a devout Christian in a pretty fundamentalist church.  Full disclosure, I'm also still a member, and to be honest, they are by and large very nice people - they hold to a mostly literal interpretation of the bible, with NT emphasis.\n\nso, i could tell it was going to be an argument when she said that she **knew i didn't agree**, but she wanted to talk to my youngest son's new teacher for next year about evolution, specifically about man coming from apes.  Christ, here we go again.\n\ni argued that *of course* they are going to teach this, it's the standard stance universally agreed by biologists, and all physical evidence that we have at our disposal indicates that this is the correct conclusion to draw.  i reiterated what evolution is and what it isn't, and that we didn't \"descend from\" apes because we were **still** apes, based on how all life forms are classified.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that my wife is a very intelligent woman.  She has a Master's in technology, teaches a foreign language, and picks up math very quickly.  The thing is...\n\nWhen it comes to these sorts of arguments, she takes the bible as the True Word Of God, and that the days of creation are, while probably not literally six days, they happened in the order given and that while \"change over time\" happened, God made man separately, and nothing will change her mind about it...it's a mental wall, mortared with stubbornness and buttressed with faith.\n\nNeedless to say, i chased her from topic to topic, presenting the scientific facts, and trying my best to hammer home how things like isotope dating are cross-verifying, objectively accurate methods of dating what we have on Earth.  i tried to make the point that science only deals with the natural world, and that \"God\" is, by definition, outside the natural realm and therefore outside the bounds of scientific inquiry.\n\nShe flitted from topic to topic, never providing proofs, just holding to those *stupid* arguments like \"can scientists measure **love**?\" and \"carbon dating is based on *man's* calculations, so there's no way to tell if they're accurate\" and a somewhat disguised version of \"it's just a *theory*\".  She never budges, never listens, and half the time will end these things in tears with \"I'll pray for you\".  Luckily, it didn't happen this time, but it's bound to happen again.\n\nMy two big handicaps are, firstly, not having the hard data at my fingertips - as most married guys know, the fastest way to take a \"discussion\" to a \"fight\" is to pull out your cellphone or laptop, no matter the reason.  My second handicap is that i'm not out yet, and i'm not ready.  She knows that i have doubts, but since i still go to church she ignores it most of the time.  What this means, however, is that i cannot say what i think about the bible, much less attack her use of it, without ending the conversation outing myself.\n\nOne question that i'm sure some will ask (and i ask myself) is, simply, why don't you grow some balls and tell her?  The reason is because i do still love her, and i love our kids, and i'm not in a position where i want to jeopardize their home life by splitting our family up.  i am, for better or worse, a peacemaker (^pussy ), and i would at this point rather let this particular argument go than risk what currently feels like everything.\n\nWow.  If you've read this far, congrats and thank you.  i have no questions or anything, i just had to vent.  Has anyone else had to deal with this?  How do you handle it?  Does anyone here still camouflage your beliefs to your family, especially spouse?  How do you deal with it?\n\nThanks all, i really do value this sub, even if i rarely comment. ",
