It was an animated movie that was set in the winter time in the snow. Animated in a sort of open season style of animation. The characters go into a stone building and then there is booby traps and one of the characters is chewing gum and puts it on a stone and it sets off a booby trap. It may or may not have featured Should I Stay or Should I Go by The Clash.",

People will explore great vastness of universe  and see all the wonders for themselves. Science will  develop to the  point where all current mysteries like Dark Matter or cure for cancer  will be easily accessible in future Wikipedia for everyone. The sad thing is that we won't be there to witness all that and all we have  are sci-fi movies and books.",

It's like 10 movies for the price of 1, beautiful romance, sad family drama, interesting sci-fi and philosophical questions. It really keeps you engaged from start to finish. I love stories with a multi-verse or butterfly effect theme because I always think about that in my own life. I wonder how greatly my decisions effect my future and what my other lives are like. The performances, editing, special effects and set design is all great. I hardly hear this movie being talked about.\n\nI also noticed some things that took inspiration from other films in a way that didn't feel trite. Films like 'Big Little Man' or 'Harry and Maude'\n\nAll around great movie! It should be on prime :)",

I LOVE The Mcu with all my heart, but to see the love for it become crippled and everyone seemingly moving away from it to be consumed by James Cameron it’s so disheartening. \n\nLet me preface by saying that this is not me bashing everyone’s love for Avatar or anything, but it makes me really jealous. I grew up loving Spiderman/The Avengers/ Marvel not Jake Sully so I feel very left out even though I’ve recently been trying to catch up with watching the movies I just don’t have that same connection to the franchise unlike the others, my connection is mostly with Marvel.\n\nBut to see the overall vibe and hype about The Mcu dying down and becoming less and less is such a tragic experience. \n\nAlso the fandoms from both are polar opposites. The Avatar fans are extremely connected and united, of course there are a lot of toxic fans, but the majority of the fans are together. Compare that to the broken and divided Mcu fandom.\n\nI just want to be proud to say I’m a Marvel fan, but I’m not. The magic just seems to be fading away and I don’t want that.",

The Maltese Falcon is basically the first fully film noir and introduces a lot of the things that went on to define the genre and is where all the tropes and cliches originated. What i find also interesting is that The Maltese Falcon was the 3rd remake of the same story.\n\nWhat do you think is the Best Film Noir?\n\nAlso what other Film Noir Movies can you recommend?",

The thing is, the two main characters are Cuban, but they never speak Spanish to each other, only English. Even worse, scenes like when Tony goes to his mom's house, and the entire family speaks English, considering that they are all Cuban, it doesn't make any sense.",

We still have irrational fears of communists, and just some pretty wacked out people in politics. Then there’s the war in Europe that was started by a an psychotic little man. But then there’s also China, which is essentially the perfect boogieman for the modern anti-communist paranoid schizophrenic.\n\n Like the whole feeling I’ve got since the balloon debacle, and the anti-China sentiment is the idea that politicians want to prime us up for war with China. A country with nuclear weapons. It’s stupid, absurd, and just downright psychotic. Just like how those generals were in the movies.\n\n“The communist Chinese want to impurify  our precious bodily fluids!”",
