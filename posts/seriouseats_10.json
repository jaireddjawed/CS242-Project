Breasts came out under done, thighs just slightly over done.\n\nThis year I spatchcocked the turkey and the thigh meat was well on its way to over cooked with the breast needing atleast another 40 minutes. I again tried foil but it was too late. Both came out overcooked. (Thankfully I sous vide a breast only to save the day).\n\nMy question is how do I juggle timing, is it simply foil sooner? Cut out the part over heating and cook the remainder longer?",

When I saw the ingredients list for Kenji's Vegetables Wellington (though it's more of a vegan wellington for me as it's not a lot of vegetables) I knew I had to give it a try.\n\nI made this over two days, heeding advice from comments on [the recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/vegetables-wellington-the-ultimate-plant-based-vegan-holiday-roast-recipe). Some of my own tips:\n\n* Because I had limited time and energy, and other foods to make, I used Better than Bouillon vegetable stock. I also used smokey tempeh bacon in place of the mushroom bacon.\n* If the fillings are a little dry from overcooking, just mix in some water by the tablespoon until it feels moist in the mouth but not too wet.\n* Next time I will go with EVOO Pam instead of brushing on olive oil, which caused the phyllo to tear sometimes.\n* My phyllo dough sheets were half the size of Kenji's, so I just halved all the fillings and made two wellingtons.\n\nI encourage you to give it a go if you like a good challenge! All the omnivores at the table loved it and went back for more!",

Pumpkin pie and buttermilk biscuits were purchased from a bakery near my house.\n\n\nThe meat was sourced from a local butcher. \n\n\nLessons learned:\n\n\n- I didn't trim the Prime Rib enough. The brown you see in the picture is the aged portion I failed to remove. Fortunately, it was easy enough to trim off before eating and the good portion of the meat was perfectly medium rare throughout.\n\n\n- Spacing out the work over two days was a life savers. Kenji's instructions for poaching eggs, storing them, and reheating them worked great. I was also able to make all of the sauces and the cranberries ahead of time.\n\n\n- I didn't get as much brown on the brocilli as I would've liked, but the crumble was still nice and crunchy. I should've let it go five more minutes, but I needed to get the oven temp up and the meat roasting before everything else got cold.\n\n\n- I did all of the cooking solo over two days, but I should've prepped someone to help toward the end. I got a little jammed up finishing the meat, getting the asparagus on plates, and getting everything else ready to serve.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, all of my guests loved it! I can't recommend prime rib over turkey enough and the recipe in the book does not disappoint!",

They cook at the same temp and I have a thermometer to monitor everything. I assume I probably could but it will have to be on the bottom rack and I'm worried that will affect it in some way. \n\nAnd speaking of the stuffing -- is there an alternative I can use for the sage sausage?

        "text": "If you want to get a bit creative since you have some gray loving guests coming next week AND you have time before Thanksgiving, start with Gritzer's Pressure Cooker Chicken Stock recipe on SE then use that stock to make Kenji's Best Turkey Gravy recipe. \n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/pressure-cooker-chicken-stock-recipe\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-turkey-gravy-recipe\n\n1.\tBuy a cheapy grocery store turkey. The ones that are about $.89 a pound. Maybe 12 lbs or so. Thaw if needed and cut out the back and then cut the bird with poultry shears into the six normal poultry pieces. Cut up the breast if you need to if it's insanely big in order to fit in the pot with the vegetables. Use fewer vegetables that Gritzer's recipe if you need pot space. \n2.\tUse 3 of the six the turkey to make the recipe. Make sure to fill then entire Instant Pot (mine is the 6qt version) to the fill line with water. Cook, release then cool a bit and strain the solids and refrigerate. Skim the fat the next day. Should make about 1.75 quarts. Refrigerate the unused three pieces, and also the back/neck/gizzards if desired. \n3.\tThen, the next day, take the other half of the turkey and use Kenji's Best Turkey Gravy recipe. Chop up/make the other three turkey pieces fit in a dutch oven, especially the breast. Use the neck and gizzards from the turkey if you want to. (I don't). Use all the stock from step 2 and then follow this recipe with the browning/soy sauce/vegetables etc. Make sure to really brown the pieces and then reduce it enough. It may take longer than the 1 hour the recipe says. \n4.\tOnce done/reduced, cool, strain and then refrigerate the completed fortified stock and then skim that fat the next day.\n5.\tOn Thanksgiving (or day before-the final results reheat really well), make a 1.5 TB flour to 1.5 TB salted butter roux per 1 cup of intended stock. So say, 4 cups of fortified stock to 6 TB each of flour/butter. Cook/stir the roux til medium dark. Not gumbo dark but farther than blond.\n6.\tWhisk in stock and reduce to desired thickness. \n7.\tSalt and pepper to taste. You'll need a fair amount of salt as neither recipe has any. The salt really brings out the flavor. Don't under salt it. \n\nLots of work yes, but makes really amazing gravy that you can make ahead. It makes that last 20-30 minutes after the turkey comes out (especially if you smoke it and there's not a ton of residual heat so limited resting) a lot less hectic when you're also dealing with all the sides, carving etc.",
