Basically her ex came back into her life and she couldn't continue dating me. \n\nThat evening i saw her in a whole new way. The way she talked and articulated herself, the way she was dressed, everything. I suddenly wanted her so much more and found her so much more attractive, after i couldn't be with her anymore. It was a very strange. The way i saw her while dating her and the way i saw her when she broke things off with me are completely different. I've never experienced something like this. \n\nMy attraction grew so much and it was like i only wanted her, whereas before i didn't see her in that way. Even looking at her pictures she's super beautiful to me, while my friends say she's just avarage. Appearance isn't the most important thing, but it's just weird how i see her so differently now.
