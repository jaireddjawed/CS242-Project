Despite the protests of her ally on Earth, her flight power is able to propel her in such a way that she can catch up to the signal and get in front of it, without experiencing any  asymptotic energy requirement, time dilation, or backward movement in time, and being able to communicate perfectly well with her ally on Earth. Later, in a lab test, she is asked to step into the middle of a large ring\\-shaped machine containing a light beam going in a circle. She takes control of the beam and is able to speed it up without much difficulty, getting it just past 3000c before the machine crashes. About a year after that, she tries to use the same trick to push an EM signal to FTL speeds to send it back in time to change the past. However, the signal fails to go back in time despite measurably reaching its destination in less time than a light beam would have \\(one researcher even comments on how the scientists at OPERA must have felt, \"only this time I'm afraid no amount of finger\\-crossing will make the results go away\"\\).\n\nMy aim is to make the story feel as authentic and believable as possible. I'm trying to understand the full implications of this so they can be fully explored by the characters",

Since gravitational force and range is in relation to mass, I can see how that would be a problem. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Is there any research out there on rocket engineerig designed to be able to ascend into orbit, or even escape orbit, from a massive gravitation, like that of a planet with 5 times earth's mass?\n\n* What would be a reasonable assessment of the highest gravity object we could escape from with current day space travel technology?\n\nThe speculation I'm making here is, Could humanity eventuqlly find itself attempting to \"Rescue\" an alien species unable to achieve space travel by introducing them to engineering developed on a planet with a much lower escape velocity?

It also has a much more aggressive timeline, similar to the pace of the Apollo program. As a layman, his plan seems the most convincing in terms of immediate feasibility and practicality. Andy Weir was even influenced by the Mars Direct plan when writing *The Martian.* Zubrin is also frequently consulted by the press when the topic of manned Mars missions come up.\n\nMy question is does anyone at NASA (or any other official space agency) take Zubrin's ideas seriously?

The upper and lower magnets can add a uniform magnetic field within a particular range (say -1 to +1) pointing up or down and the left and right magnets can create a magnetic field within a range (again -1 to +1) but for the left/right directions. Summing together different combinations of up/down and left/right can give a range of magnetic fields pointing at any angle. One can even input a rotating magnetic field by changing the angle continuously. And all that is required is two controls (on for each pair).\n\nWhat is the name of this kind of device?

I'm currently working in a grape virus research laboratory and part of my job involves counting every individual flower cap that falls from the grape vine by catching them into a bag that has been set around each vine. Now, I know that once the flowers from the grapevine bloom, I'll have at least a couple thousand of them bagged to count, but I think it'd be very inefficient to do so by hand. So I was wondering if anyone may have suggestions on how I could go about counting so many pea-sized flower caps as accurately as possible besides doing so by hand. Thank you!",
