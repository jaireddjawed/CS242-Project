        "text": "DISCLAIMER: I am not an engineer. I am a welder by day, tinkerer by night. I like to think I have a pretty firm grasp on basic electronics/programming and a marginally firmer grasp on mechanics.\n\nI have also flaired this under electrical, however this would apply to mechanical engineers just as well I think.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA few months ago I had my welding rig stolen, 2007 F350 with a 6.0L Diesel. The buggers took everything of value off of it, and then went joy riding and trashed what ever was left. I towed it home from the police impound and it's been sitting in front of my house for the last couple months while I ponder what to do with it.\n\nThere's a project that I've wanted to build since I was a teenager. A turboshaft engine inspired by the GR-5 Experimental Engine project built by rcdon linked [here](https://www.rcdon.com/html/gr-5_turboshaft_engine_project.html). However, instead of building a homebrew axial turbine for the power turbine, I figured it would be more efficient to utilize a turbocharger by removing the compressor wheel and coupling the shaft to a gearbox. The turbocharger out of the 6.0 would be perfect for that due to its large size and the fact that it has a variable geometry veined turbine which could be utilized to control engine load. I was also playing around with the idea of using diesel fuel/fuel oil in combination with propane. I decided on cannibalizing the injection system out of the 6.0, in which i will drive the HPOP off the output gearbox, and cut a couple sections off the head of the engine so i can utilize the waterjacket and the fuel galleries to maintain good function of the fuel injectors. I also will use the MAF sensor but that's not important to the matter at hand.\n\n\nRUNNING TESTS\n\nIf I want to use the fuel injectors off this engine I need three things: a constant supply of high pressure oil, a constant supply of low pressure fuel, and proper timing. First two are easy, third one will take a little more work. My plan was to pull the truck into my downstairs neighbours garage, run tests and collect data, and then pull the engine so I can get the truck taken to a scrap yard sometime this week. I borrowed my dads oscilloscope and got to work.\n\nThe harness connected to each injector has four wires: spool valve open signal (48V), spool valve open return, spool valve close signal (48V), spool valve close return. For those unfamiliar with the Navistar HUEI system the spool valve is what allows high pressure oil into the injector which then actuates a piston that pressurizes the fuel which is then injected into the combustion chamber, illistrated [here](https://www.drivingline.com/articles/60l-power-stroke-problems-part-6-injectors/). The first mistake we made was hooking the probe ground to the return wires, which resulted in absolute jibberish on the oscilloscope. After some trouble shooting and consulting my dad, we figured to hook the probe ground to chassis ground and started to get some results. However we were still struggling to get a clean signal for an unknown reason which resulted in making our second mistake: being impatient. I should of took more time to run more tests on different injectors at different RPMs but frustration was starting to set in, our window for getting the engine pulled was narrowing, and me and my buddy were both getting really tired of breathing in diesel fumes.\n\n\nTHE DATA\n\nOK that was a little long winded, lets see the data! Our turmoil and carbon monoxide poisoning resulted in two successful tests, one at idle and one at 2500RPM. Unfortunately I only took pictures of the idle test. Again, I should've took the time to document better but for the reasons above it just didn't happen. See below for the pictures of the first test, the top graph is probe 1 which was hooked to the open signal, the bottom graph is probe 2 hooked to the close signal.\n\n[Idle-750RPM Cycle Timing](https://i.imgur.com/rdhzNj5.jpg): One cycle every 43ms\n[Idle-750RPM Pulse Timing](https://i.imgur.com/2Obzy5n.jpg): 1ms pulses, 2.1ms between the beginning of the open pulse to end of close pulse\n\n2500RPM Cycle Timing: One cycle every 10.5ms\n2500RPM Pulse Timing: Same as idle\n\n\nMY INTERPRETATION\n\nThe first thing I found surprising is that it seems that the injector solenoid runs on a LOW signal. All the Navistar/Ford literature says the the FICM sends a 20A 48V pulse to the solenoid that controls the injector, but clearly it sustains a 48V signal and pulses at 0V. I find that a little confusing but the way I'm understanding it is this is the same as active LOW logic on say a microcontroller. Is this assumption correct?\n\nThe second thing I found surprising is the 8V drop in between cycles on the close signal. I'm not really sure what to make of that. Maybe that's from oil pressure building up behind the spool valve causing the solenoid to \"work harder\" and causing a voltage drop?\n\nThe third thing I found very surprising is that the cycles of the injector is faster than the RPMs of the engine. Shown in the first picture, the injector is actuated once every 43ms, or 23HZ, or 1395 RPM - 1395/750 = 1.86. On my 2500 RPM test, the injector is actuated once every 10.5ms, or 95HZ, or 5714.4 - 5714/2500 = 2.29. Accounting for inaccuracies in the signal to or reading the tachometer, it seems that the engine is injecting fuel twice per stroke or four times per power stroke! What is the deal with that!? Was something buggered up with the FICM? Did I hook up something wrong? Am I on glue? Or is there some reasonable explaination? I am incredible confused with this result. It's not very important to the project at hand, but still what the hell?\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI have the FICM disassemble on my desk right now. In these following week I plan to see if I can \"hack\" it by making it think its hooked up to an operating engine and then maybe I can run some more tests on it. Anyways what do you all think about this?",

All I’ve been given is how much it costs to to continuously keep the vat at its operating temperature 24 hours a day. The working hours the vat is used. how much it cools down by if it were turned off at the end of the shift. From this I’m meant to work out how much it would cost to reheat the zinc to its operating temperature. Obviously I can work out the rate in which it cools but how fast it heats up will surely depend on how hot the vat can go. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

About 10 years ago, I flipped a coin and did something that I *had* to do (fly helicopters professionally). I still love what I do, but have been considering my future and the sustainability and 'portability' of this career.\n\nI am 34, and have some Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits left that I need to burn up. I was wondering if it's possible to consider doing an online program while still working and flying professionally. I have Googled for answers to my questions, but I figure this is something best left for the hive mind to be realistic (to ask for plausibility vs possibility)\n\nMy demographic/background: Single dad with a B.S. in Business Management, with kids, a full time job, 50% schedule (working half the week), and living in Texas. I'm thinking online is the most realistic path. I've always been interested in mechanical engineering, materials science, anything you can hold in your hands and create (vs CE or Software Engineer), but am open to suggestion. I enjoy travel and miss it a bit as I used to travel more often. 50%ish is a good bit of fun.\n\nSo, for the crowd:\n\n* Does the school really matter?\n* What online schools are good (for working with Post-9/11 guys, decent online courses, etc). I've heard of ASU, DeVry, UofH, UT Austin, but don't know what really sticks out as \"the one\" for online or , if it matters, clout.\n* Has anyone done this, themselves?\n* Just really trying to start the conversation and dig up the rabbit holes for myself.\n\nThanks!",

The gun barrel is a piece of aluminium pipe of 13 mm ID and 160mm length.  \nAs a reservoir I made a small tank with a 30 mm OD aluminum pipe with has a wall thickness of 1.5 mm, I didn't weld anything the caps on the ends of this tank are 3d printed and sealed with epoxy, held in place with two aluminum plates, one on each end of the pipe,  that are held to one another via 3 M5 threaded rods, as a safety mechanism I left a 10mm hole which I'm covering with thin copper tape, considering that the burst pressure of the tape would be much lower than any of the other parts.   \n\n\nSo far so good, the reservoir was tested to 50 psi today  and it held pretty well, also the burst disc bursted after 75 psi. More testing needs to be done but the concept seems reasonable, I'm not planning on going above 8 bars of pressure or 100 psi on the reservoir, mainly cause I'm scared of my craft and also cause the solenoid valves I'm using for releasing the gas into the barrel are rated to a max of 8 bars.  \n\n\nSo, question here is how can I achieve some level of consistency between shots considering that after every shot I'd be losing some gas and some pressure.  \nIs it reasonable to time the opening of the solenoid valve in a sort of proportional manner to let the right amount of gas out each time or would this require a ridiculous amount of fine control over the valve ?  \n\n\nShall I use an intermediate vessel where I would store the right amount of gas for each shot?  \n\n\nAlso, do you think the safety measures I took (burst disc) on the reservoir tank is enough considering the pressure I'd be working with and the materials used?  \n\n\nThank you",

        "text": "I have a new ebike I've been really enjoying that I've modifed with assorted new features.   One of the last I had in mind is adding a rear light that also uses the brake lever switch(es) to brighten up (as a brake light).   I'm 90% there now and I completely lucked out in finding this cool \"48v indicator light\" on Amazon which is pretty much perfect in that it runs at 48v and draws less current than my bench supply can even read.  \n\nMy side question is: How do they even do that?  There are only 6 diodes per module, do 8v red SMD led's even exist?  Is there some tiny voltage regulator hidden in there somewhere?   Anyway.. they're great.\n\nSo, this bike, like most (all?) cuts power to the motor whenever either brake is activated- so it has a switch in each lever assembly that both go to the same input on the controller.  They measure milivolts when brakes are at rest and 4.76v when brakes are activated.  I planned to use [a tiny low power non-latching signal relay](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/283/relay_ua2_ub2_e-528002.pdf) for this thinking my coil voltage would be 4.76v and switched voltage would be around 50v at some very low mA.  But, it seems that I can't pull enough current to switch that coil.  \n\nCan I do this with a transistor or is there some other solution here?  It will be running thru a 100k resistor most of the time and then bypass that resistor when either lever is activated to run at full brightness.\n\nHere is an image of the setup presently. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/RAAVjph.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RAAVjph.jpg)",

Have any of you seen that to be true? If I go to study mechanical or electrical engineering, are there elective classes that might better lead into work in the field of medical devices? \n\nAnd if I do end up with an undergraduate degree in BME, would getting a master's degree significantly increase my odds of landing a job?

I need to design a wire assembly that goes from the remote sense lines of the power supply module to the PCB. I've encountered an issue that the existing connector is a 22 awg connector but the minimum rated size for the power supply remote sense connections is 28 awg. Is there a good way to splice two different awg sizes together into a finished product? Most stuff I can find online is about splicing together two different wire sizes for hobbyist and home projects.",

We have to graph these properties for a range of Mach numbers, specifically 2-5.\n\nFor these type of reports, what is the proper number (frequency? precision?) of values we should use for this Mach number range when graphing? I was thinking of graphing over something on the order of 10\\^4 intervals between 2 and 5 to be thorough. Is there an engineering and/or statistical standard that we should be following? Never took a stats class and am curious what real world reports would expect for something like this. Thank you!",

The same page also says [ideal storage is above 5 C](https://bikegrade.com/ebike-battery-storage-temperature/#In_A_Cold_Environment).
