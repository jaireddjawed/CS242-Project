        "title": "PhD supervisors as references for job applications AFTER quitting PhD",
        "author": "Cool_Capital",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/9ihc7o/phd_supervisors_as_references_for_job/",
        "text": "Dear everyone!\n\n**Short story plus question:**\n\nI want to quit my PhD because of irreconcilable differences (see long story). I am unsure of how my supervisors will react. Probably poorly. Since they have technically been the employers I have worked with for the past two years, when I go out into the job market to find a job, I have to cite them both as my references.\n\n**I haven't quit yet and my supervisors don't suspect I will. How can I quit in the best possible way so that when they are contacted to recommend me for a job, they don't ruin all my possibilities of finding a job?**\n\n**Long story:**\n\nI am employed as a pre-doctoral researcher in Europe, that means I am technically an employee for a university but my work is that of a PhD student. I was hired for a project I didn't apply to. I wasn't selected for the original project I wanted but they had kept my CV and contacted me months later for another project on the premise that it could be adapted to something that fit both me and the original idea. The project goals have always been murky for me and the other students in my position. That has worked out since the idea was to narrow down the research question and make it our own.\n\nThat plan didn't work out for me. I have two supervisors. One of them is amazing to work with, is quite accomplished and helps me learn a lot but he isn't in charge. The other, not so much. He is an archaic researcher w/ old school values. I found this out way too late in the game but he has a track record of having PhD students walk out on him and never coming back.\n\nI consider myself to be a clever, hard-working student. I obtained a good under­graduate grade point average, my thesis received a distinction. I won a scholarship for my masters degree and graduated with a distinction degree. Plus, my research was published in a reputable scientific magazine. For my PhD, I had originally won a Fulbright scholarship, I ended not taking it up because I had to study in the US and I was in a relationship w/my then boyfriend and now husband whom is based in the UK. He is my rock and I do not regret that decision. He has also made similar sacrifices for our relationship.\n\nA couple of months after I started the PhD, I knew something was wrong. I recall having agitated meetings with both supervisors where I defended why what I was told to do wasn't contributing to answering the research question and despite that, they kept insisting I continue. I am an assertive person. I speak up and have had no problems until a chain of emails unravelled which led the difficult supervisor to threaten to cancel the project. I was shocked and gaslighted into believing I had been rude.\n\nMore than a year later I am proud of what I did because it was the right thing. The difficult supervisor has since then threatened to cancel other protects with other students and hasn't really supported my research. It's not me, it's him.\n\nBeyond the bad relationship with my supervisors, I am concerned about the PhD as a job. First of all, although I am the student in charge of the project, I am forced to do activities that do not contribute to answering the research question.\n\nI tried to make a point at the beginning about this but I was made to belief I was crazy and that I should trust the process. And so I did and a year and a half later, it hasn't panned out. I am not learning, I am not interested and the difficult supervisor barely gives any helpful contributions. He is quick to protest but barely suggests a solution. Yes, the burden is on me and I would happily assume it up if anything were my idea. It is not. I am in my late twenties and I care about my career. A lot. I don't care about the degree and getting a PhD because I will not continue in academia.\n\nI care about developing my skills and learning as much as I can, and I am not. I want out. I want to find a job as a data analyst and forget I ever spend those two years trying to do a PhD. But I am afraid to quit because of the reference letters (see short story and question). Any ideas would be amazing!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "I busted my ass and stayed late most nights, despite having small children, to study for my first Genetics exam this last Friday. From the moment it was mentioned in lecture I started studying dilligently. I'm planning to graduate this semester and go to graduate school for an MS in the field and lab that I've been doing research in most of my undergrad. I'm scheduled to take over and run the lab this Spring, in fact. But I have to pass Genetics first, because it is a degree requirement.\n\nI failed my first exam. (Well, a D, but basically the same thing at my school; a C- is also not a passing grade). Apparently this class is the second most difficult course at my university, behind Evolution. My university is very heavy in the sciences so second place is saying something :( \n\nI am completely devastated. I felt so good about the exam too, I did some hardcore study sessions with one of the TA's of the class/friend, and she is an incredible teacher. I just dont understand what I did wrong... should I hold off on graduation by giving up the class and try taking it again later? That sounds depressing and is totally the opposite of what I want to do. I'm just really concerned that I'm one of the people who just wont 'get it', and also that test was covering the easiest material of the semester.. what should I do? I have consistent contact with the professor as well, but at this point there isnt anything she would be able to do; believe me, I've been pestering her since the semester began. I dont really have many other resources available to me. Does anyone have any advice? Could I come back from the failing of the first exam in a class like this? Thanks reddit.\n\n\nUpdate, for anyone interested: I got my exam back today and I definitely got these answers wrong; i think it had a lot to do with me going into the exam knowing how tricky her questions would be, and I overthought the questions too much. I met with my genetics professor, and met with my PI. My PI takes very good care of me and our relationship is closely similar to father/daughter, just in a professional sense. Does that even make sense? Either way, he isnt too concerned yet, and his opinion matters to me the most. (He had a \"you'll do much better next time\" kind of attitude; but then again, he has invested in me for the last three years as an undergrad, and now he is relying on me to officially take the lab over in Spring, so he expects me to do better next time, no questions asked). \n\nMy genetics professor and I actually have a rather candid mom-to-mom relationship outside of class, since our kids are in and will continue to be in the same class throughout elementary school (which is an interesting dynamic to navigate right now). She sat with me for a while in her office and we didn't discuss specific questions, we discussed more proficient methods of absorbing the information and ways of organizing it. She definitely wants to help me.. actually everyone I have been studying with and getting help from this past week has been so supportive and helpful.. I've gotten so many tips and different study methods from so many different people today; friends in class, TA of class/friend, genetics professor, three or four graduate students I know in various fields, and my PI have all said basically the same thing.\n\nStudy smarter, you've got this.\n\n\nSo I will try! If anyone else has any study tips I would love to hear them!!",

I have since been doing really well at work. I went from being a very mediocre student to a superstar at the office. Still, I feel called to be a professor, as dumb as that sounds. The fact that you get paid to do research that you find interesting and discover truths about the world is literally the coolest thing I could imagine. I've considered going to therapy to address the issues that prevented me from being a successful PhD student and maybe reapplying for a program some years down the line. But I also feel like I should maybe just accept that the academic lifestyle will never be a fit for me and fulfill my calling in other ways. Has anyone had a similar experience?",

I joined a lab as soon as I started my second degree and I love it but it's not really a high pressure/prolific lab and they don't just attach your name to publications if all you did was help with data collection.

Two are T.A. positions wherein I just grade papers, one is an in-class position aiding students, and the other is a T.A. position wherein I plan and lecture in weekly undergrad classes based on a preset guideline, mark weekly assignments and evaluate larger projects.\n\nIf I was being assigned these hours on a weekly basis as advertised, I would be working around 35 hours a week between all my jobs. One of my grading positions has grown into more than I bargained for, because the prof was aiming to hire more hands and decided to just dump all the work onto me. The teaching position, though, is what's overloading me: I get paid for 8 hours of work a week, and I've been putting at least 12 in per week before the first assignment was due. Right now, I'm expected to grade about 30 papers for this class and 47 for another within the next week. Between my office hours, weekly meetings with my supervisor, class time, emails, planning lectures, and now grading, I'm capping 20 hours a week with *just* the more substantial T.A. position. Everything else included, I'm putting in 13 hour days. It's only September, and I feel as wrung out as I usually do by mid-December.\n\n\nI'm not sure what to do in this instance; I don't feel like I can quit any of these T.A. positions. I'm worried that complaining to my supervisor will make me sound like an inefficient or incompetent T.A. They did mention during orientation that I should speak to them if I feel overloaded, but I think that's so they can take some of the workload off and has nothing to do with compensation. What's more, because I only got the material to teach this class two days before my first session, I've been scrambling to keep up with the class. I don't know how to cut down on the work without leaving myself unprepared to give my lectures.\n\nWould you think your T.A. was inefficient if they complained to you about being undercompensated? Am I racking up these hours because of inexperience?",

Every paper takes ages and countless revisions only to get these scathing reviews that -- while definitely containing valid criticism -- also read condescending and petty. I'm not even excited by the science in the paper anymore, but I know it needs to get out. I feel like a hamster in a wheel, all for a line on a cv. \n\nIn my new job I'm working with RAs who, while definitely much more inexperienced than I am, seem to pick up on things faster than I can. If they had PhDs I would hire them instead of me. I'm also working with an assistant professor who is only a few years younger than me. He is not my direct superior, but it still feels like I don't know how I fit into science. I've lost the enthusiasm for the work that the post-baccs and grad students have, but don't feel like I have any actual real knowledge. Even the stuff I'm supposed to be good at -- I make so many mistakes, all the time. I feel stupid all the time, even while I'm training the RAs on how to do the job. It feels like I'm training them to replace me.\n\nPeople like working with me (I keep getting hired), and I like the people I work with, but I'm either not cut out for science or I just have zero confidence in my ability to do almost anything. I know this isn't sustainable but I also don't know what to do. I have a 3 month old at home and am literally the only person in the lab who has a kid...so while feeling paralyzed by lack of confidence at work (people ask me to do very simple tasks that take me too many questions to clarify and too many days to complete), no one really can relate to the level of tiredness and worry that now permanently occupy my body. I also can barely carve out time to take a shower or eat a hot meal at home. I feel so off my game in every area of life. I just want to take a  bunch of naps, really, but that doesn't pay the bills, keep the baby fed, or keep my husband thinking I'm a good partner.

After publication I noticed I had incorrectly cited a few phrases. That is, I took the phrases in verbatim and prefixed them with 'x argued/said', cited them but did not put quotation marks around them as I mistakenly believed that was not necessary. There was also one sentence which probably falls under general knowledge, but I poorly paraphrased and did not cite the source of. In total, about 40 words out of a 4000 word essay. I have subsequently told the editor about these mistakes and provided the corrections, which they've (thankfully) said they'll get onto ASAP.\n\nI know there is far worse plagiarism out there, not that I'm trying to defend my stupidity, but in the unlikely event that a reader or member of faculty noticed these mistakes and brought them to the attention of the university, how screwed would I be? Would the fact I identified them beforehand and requested corrections mitigate it?\n\nSecondly, I handed the rights of the article over to the publishers and they are under no obligation to make these corrections. In the unlikely event they decided to not make these corrections, what would my alternatives be?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I am looking to drop, but I just found out that I am two days past the drop deadline, so now it would count as a 'W' on my transcript. How big of a deal is this?\n\nFor a little context, I am planning on moving on to a PhD program (hopefully next year). I have had a really good first year here which has resulted in a strong CV, and have had multiple profs in my department indicate recently that I could 'go anywhere I wanted to'. I plan to apply to a few labs that interest me, some of which are at pretty prestigious universities. When I asked a couple mentors what they thought of the W, they weren't really all that sure what the effect would be (one of them didn't even know grad students could get W's), which is why I am asking internet strangers. Basically, I want to know how much would a 'W' hurt my chances? Does it really look all that bad on a transcript? I'm sure there is a little variation from institution to institution, but I just want to get a general idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

I know I want to pursue some form of higher education to be able to do some good in the world.

To that end I am not sure if going for my master's in anthropology or going for a law Degree would be better.  There is something about anthropology which seems to transcend one's natural beliefs for a better look at the world that I could see as being very useful, especially in international relations.  At the same time learning the law will give me a better grasp of how the entire system works.

I took his lower division class as a freshman and I did so well that he asked me to be a TA and I have been a TA for his class since fall 2015, I have known this professor longer than any other professor at my university. However, not only is it a lower division class, it is a physics class and I am applying for biology PhD programs. Because this professor is in an unrelated field of science, does that make him a bad candidate to write a letter of recommendation, despite the fact that I know him so well?\n\n   \n \n\nProfessor 3: I am currently taking an upper division lecture course from this professor. I also had two previous classes with him, both of the previous classes were just labs, but one was upper division and the other was a freshman level course. This professor teaches courses in biology at least but he is only an adjunct professor with a master’s degree. Is it okay if a letter comes from a professor that has gone to graduate school but isn't tenured and doesn't have a PhD?\n\n   \n \n\nProfessor 4: The last professor I am considering asking taught an upper division biology class that I took in the spring and got an 'A' in. He has a PhD and researches topics that are very similar to what I would like to study in graduate school. We have talked a few times outside of the class and since his research and my mentors research take place in the same lab I see him there on occasion as well, so he is probably at least familiar with who I am. But since we are both pretty quiet and reserved individuals we haven't had many personal interactions, but we have at least had a few interactions outside of class. I have known this professor for the shortest amount of time and he probably doesn't know me to the same level that the other three professors do. \n\n   \n \n\nSo, do you think these four professors would be good candidates to ask for a letter of recommendation? Are there any that you think I shouldn't ask for any reason?

My professor did not mention a limitation and I am not sure how long my letter of intent should be. I was assuming one to two pages, yet, I just wanted to check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks everyone for your input. ",

I was a English Lit undergrad and am currently doing my masters in an English department with a track in linguistics. My interests are in mobility and globalization studies and how these impact language use, linguistic landscapes, language policy, and linguistic discrimination in higher education. I believe that all of these former interests can be examined through the later. And out of all of these, I get the most fired up (not angry, just passionate) when talking about language and the education system. \n\n\nI know the job market is abysmal for humanities graduates, and better—but only slightly—for the social sciences. \n\n\nI think I really would like to be a professor that teaches and conducts research, too. So, I was wondering what the job market might look like for the Higher Ed/Ed Policy.\n\n\n\nThanks! \n\n\n",

Honestly I’m pretty divided on which position I’d like more even if I did get offered both, but right now I’m going through the interview rounds with the biotech company while my supervisor tells me that this week is the week they’ll finally have started processing my post doc. I’m not sure what to do here: I’d like to take the interview with the biotech company as far into the process as possible because I’ve always wanted to work outside academia , and I  didn’t think this type of opportunity existed where I lived when I agreed to the post doc. However at some point it’d too late presumably to back out of my post doc. And since my supervisor for my post doc is the same for my phD, I really need him to not be mad at me so that he can be my reference for future jobs.  Did anyone else go through this or have insight as to when I can still back out of a post doc without doing damage to my relationship with my supervisor ? ",

When visiting my schools website and viewing the Dean's list requirement's I found nothing stating that taking a course pass/fail would make me ineligible for receiving all 12 of my credits.  The only thing I could find regarding the impact it would have was this, \" Courses taken on a pass/fail basis are excluded from the GPA calculation.\"  If the courses taken on a pass/fail basis are excluded from the GPA calculation why would they also be excluded from the the amount of credits I am taking seeing I am still taking the course and showing up the receive my Pass for the semester. Under the College's Pass/Fail section on their website it also does not alert the student that taking a course pass/fail will make them ineligible for the Dean's List for the semester.  Is there anything I can do about this seeing that my College fails to make their students aware that taking a course pass/fail will make them ineligible for the Dean's List for that semester?",
