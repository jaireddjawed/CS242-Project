        "text": "I think that alongside the monthly small posts thread, we should start having a monthly goodling thread where we post small examples of goodling, especially in Reddit comments.\n\nI think a monthly goodling thread might be a good addition for our non-linguist visitors. The vast majority of posts here are Reddit comments, and most of those comments get back-linked to /r/badlinguistics by a quote tagging bot. When visitors follow the back-link to our community, they only see examples of *inaccurate* armchair linguistics posts and ultimately probably learn nothing about linguistics because there is nothing explaining what *good* linguistics looks like (although the required \"why\" comment certainly helps). Some might say they can get goodling at /r/linguistics (which, let's face it, not always), but can we really expect a layman visitor to surf through our subreddit network?\n\nIf we have a monthly thread that celebrates goodling, this will provide a contrast for our visitors, who may glean something about linguistics and understand why badling frustrates us, since they have goodling to compare. Ultimately, I think it may help us a little from looking like a brigading circlejerk, and might help prevent flame wars caused by visitors. Plus, casual goodling ought to be recognized! After all, it's pretty much what we're trying to promote.",

        "text": "[Baldling here](http://i.imgur.com/QshPLfO.jpg)\n\nSorry for the highly compressed image. Text - \n\n&gt; About 5000 years ago, a sage *Vyasadeva* first wrote down the vast vedic knowledge on palm leaves. The Sanskrit script he used is known as *Devanagari.* Shown here is a sample text from *Bhagavad-gita,* with original Devanagari and roman transliteration.  \n\n**Explanation** -\n\nThis is a fairly low hanging fruit for this sub, but unfortunately I've seen many who tend to believe in the above quoted statement. \n\nFirst of all, this is quoted from the *Bhagavad-gita as it is* - the definitive version of the gita. ^^according ^^to ^^ISKCON ISKCON is a fairly regular topic of discussion over at /r/badEasternPhilosophy because they have no qualms in appropriating things to make everything appeal to the western followers and this badling is nothing out of the ordinary for them. \n\n&gt; About 5000 years ago, a sage *Vyasadeva* first wrote down the vast vedic knowledge on palm leaves.\n\nVyasadeva, nor his contemporaries, ever wrote down vedas. Writing down vedas is a big no-no. Vedas were transmitted orally - *sruti*(\"what is heard\"). \n\nFrom the paper - Witzel, Michael. \"Tracing the Vedic dialects.\" *Dialectes dans les littératures indo-aryennes* (1989): 97-264.\n\nThe author states:\n\n&gt;   It is well known that the Vedas have not reached us in \ntheir original form. \nJust as many other Indian texts, like the Pāli canon, the Mahābhārata, etc., \nthey have gone through a period of oral transmission which was followed by a \nredaction.  In the case of the various Vedic texts, this has been well studied \non\nly for the \nṚgveda, notably by Oldenberg in his Prolegomena.\n\n &gt; The text of \nthe RV has been transmitted by only one school, the \nŚākala \nśākhā\n.  The other \ntwo prominent schools, that of the Bāṣkalas and M\nāṇḍukeyas, have, for all \npractical purposes, been lost. \n As far as the other Vedas are concerned, this \nprocess has not been studied and understood very well.\n\n &gt;Just as in the case \nof the \nṚgveda, however, there are a number of indications which show that \nthese texts had a pronunciation which was different from t\nhe form that the \ntexts have now, in their post-redactional shape.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Vedas were written down at their inception. It is only much later that we have evidence of vedas and other texts being preserved in written form. \n\n&gt; The Sanskrit script he used is known as *Devanagari.*\n\nThis is so stupid. Just terrible misappropriation of history. *Devanagari* script first emerged in the 8th century AD and right now is the most common script in India. But this script only rose to prominence in the 19th century during the British Raj. There is no way *Vyasadeva* had any knowledge of *Devanagari.*  ",
