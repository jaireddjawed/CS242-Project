Whenever I visit Japan I can get most of the message across, but I definitely sound like a barbarian stringing verbs and nouns together with little to no conjugation. Does anyone have a recommended daily-practice resource that's mostly grammar? I am looking at Tae Kim's guide and bunpro. Should I get Genki vol. 1? Thanks very much!",

        "text": "I figured it would be fun to do some textual analysis for Japanese learners. Particularly because the game has the original calling cards in-game (just like a lot of other items throughout the game).\n\n \n\n才能が枯渇した虚飾の大罪人,\n\n斑目一流斎殿。\n\n権威を傘に門下生から着想を盗み、\n\n盗作すらいとわぬ芸術家,。\n\n我々はすべての罪をお前の口から告白させることにした。\n\nその歪んだ欲望を頂戴する。\n\n**心の怪盗団より**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*English (my loose translation, not necessarily the original English version of the game):*\n\n (To) the great criminal, who merely shows off as his true talent has run out,\n\nMister Madarame Ichiryusai\n\nStealing the ideas of those pupils under your authority,\n\nyou are an artist that does not even hold back from plagiarism/stoops as low as plagiarism.\n\nWe have decided to make you confess every one of your crimes from your own mouth.\n\nWe will take your distorted desires.\n\n**From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Romaji:*\n\nTensai ga kokatsu shita kyoshoku no daizainin\n\nMadarame Ichiryusai-dono.\n\nKen'i wo kasa ni monkasei kara chakusou wo nuzumi,\n\ntousaku sura itowanu geijutsuka.\n\nWareware ha subete no tsumi wo omae no kushi kara kokuhaku saseru koto ni shita.\n\nsono yuganda yokubou wo choudai suru.\n\n**kokoro no kaitoudan yori**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Notes:***\n\n斑目一流斎殿: Madarame Ichiryusai-dono. Welcome back to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names. 斑 (Madara) means spotty, pimply, somehow not quite right. Mr. Spotty Eyes? It's not a flattering name, whereas the second part 一流斎 sounds more like how he presents himself, a traditional stoic master. Two contradictions in one name.\n\nMore importantly is the final title \"dono\" which I translated with \"Mister\" (different from Mr.).\"Dono\" is different from what kanji, meaning \"lord\" implies. \"dono\" at the end of a name is very pejorative, like looking down on the person. Like a teacher looks down on a naughty student, or a superior looks down on an employee.\n\nすら : a nice high level alternative of さえ, even\n\nいとわぬ (itowanu) is almost literary. Elegant negative form of itou (Kanji 厭う) vs. simple negative of itowanai. itou: to shirk from, to shun, to shy away from, to not dare.  Negative hear would mean, does not even shy away from, has no qualms doing x...\n\n頂戴する: a nice formal way of saying to take, to gladly accept taking something.\n\n歪んだ (yuganda) is the past form of 歪む (yugamu). 歪 is a Hyougai Kanji outside of the two official lists. Meaning to \"be distorted\", (even the kanji itself is made of two parts, \"not\" at the top and \"correct\" at the bottom). It's an important term throughout the game.\n\nことにした (Koto ni shita): part of the \"koto ni suru\" grammatical construction, i.e. to be decided, to decide on\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother nice word to add not in the text is the Japanese word here for \"calling card\" which is 予告状 (Yokokujou). Oddly enough, in the soundtrack, the lyrics of the battle song \"Take Over\" make reference to a \"prior notice card\" which is a direct translation of the word.",

I might be biased because I grew up watching anime and listening to J-pop but like how do you except me to write this? It’s easier just to learn how to speak it and then learn how to write it similar to how a baby does. Babies don’t learn grammar at first, they learn vocabulary, then learn grammar, then learn the writing systems, then learn to read, then learn to write, then go to school and learn some more. I might as well bite the bullet and pay that college $30,000 a year to learn Japanese at this point but my bank account says no. I may be mentally ill, but I am also a genius (they tested my IQ). I have no problem with French or Spanish. I have no trouble with speaking Japanese. Or listening to it. Or the grammar or reading it. It’s the writing Kanji that’s going to be the death of me.

As a part of a mid year feedback session, my students mentioned they want a vocab specific lesson. Now vocab is super boring so I know if I just go ahead and spit vocab at them I will just bore them to death. I usually sprinkle in the relevant vocab in every week and use it in sessions when I introduce a new concept/ topic, so I'm not entirely sure how to make learning vocab in a classroom environment fun. So far I have created a hangman game with part of the N5 vocab list. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to make learning vocab interesting and fun, or anyone who has been in a lesson where a teacher managed this please share your story. \n\nI want to point out I am not a qualified teacher and I have no official training (although I have been taught how to teach by a certified EAL teacher) and I am by no means good at Japanese, I'm just good at explaining concepts in a fun and digestible manner.",

I know Kiwi browser allows browser extensions and thus Yomichan and was wondering how good it works on the Boox compared to a regular phone or tablet. For reading French I use a Kobo Clara which has multiple dictionaries built in (not for Japanese sadly) but the look ups take quite long because of the refresh rate of the screen. Obviously this normally wouldn't be a problem but for language learners who use the dictionary multiple times a page this can become quite frustrating. Even for French right now it's tolerable but my Japanese isn't anywhere near my French level and especially kanji require quite a lot of look ups. How is the refresh rate for most Onyx Boox models and is it worth using over my phone? I'd love to hear your opinions so I can make a better informed decision. Thanks in advance.",

        "text": "After a longer break, I've been slowly getting back to learning Japanese and gradually revising the already forgotten stuff over the last couple of months. I decided it was time for me to begin consuming Japanese media. Despite never really being interested in manga, I thought that the medium is ideal for the purpose, as it combines short, concise sentences with visual aid. I recently imported 15 tomes of Youbato! which I wanted to start reading this weekend or at the beginning of the next week. This raised a question however: how to effectively study and revise newly acquired vocabulary?\n\nI am currently using Anki with Tango N5+4 decks but - as ideal solution as it might be - I am afraid that creating my own deck and adding new words would be too much of a hassle, due to the nature of medium. No add-ons, extractors, immediate words lookup thanks to the internet access and so on. With this being said, I originally planned on setting up a jpdb account as it already was my main online dictionary of choice. After reading this week's post, listing differences between Anki and jpdb however I started having my doubts. On top of listed cons of the latter really resonating with me, I am also not really a fan of registering anywhere if not needed or splitting something over two separate, yet similar tools. Not to mention I am usually doing my Anki review during morning commute to work - having to go over to a different site and logging in only to continue with my review would be another unnecessary step, as stupid as that may sound. Finally, I remembered that even if I wanted to rely on jpdb's pre-build decks to skip the deck creation process or study vocab in advance, they only provide them for Anime, Novels, Visual novels, Web novels and Live action. Manga and video games - two medium I was going to focus on are being left out, meaning yet another argument for jpdb goes out the window.\n\nI am really curious what are your approaches and setup, if I really decided to go the Anki route. How and when you add the new vocab - during or after reading session? Do you translate every unknown word or simply accept that you do not understand 100% of what you're reading and move on? Only vocabulary, example sentences with said word or direct quote from manga, where you encountered it? Anki settings for the deck: steps, lapses etc?\n\nOn the other hand, now that I am writing this post maybe the jpdb approach would not be that bad? After all, when reading I would probably be in my bed or somewhere else with no access to PC. Same thing goes for video games actually, as I would be playing on 3DS or PS3 - still no possibility of quickly checking the meaning of a new word and/or creating and adding a new card to the deck. This way I could keep my phone next to me and - using jpdb - do both at the same time. It's not like I was going to take screenshots or photos of the page to later add to the card (although that *did* briefly go through my mind at one point).\n\nOnce again, what are your opinions, advice and experiences regarding this matter?",

I'm only really doing this because I've seen other people dive into this sort of content from day 1 in the immersion learning community and I've heard nothing but mostly success stories, but I've also hard conflicting opinions from others saying that it's a waste of time to do so.",

I'm celebrating a 100% score at distinguishing the 30 first hiragana! (a bit less in writing, but I keep improving). \n\nMy question is more about culture than language, but both since really linked together in Japanese. \n\nA bit of back story: my brother (French) met his now wife a few years ago and they got married last year while living in Canada. They just move to Osaka and we will travel there with my mother for the wedding ceremony in April (the wedding itself will be in okinawa).\n\nI'm a late diagnosed autistic, so social cue aren't my best skill, but at the same time, I can be very good at following etiquette as long as the rule are clearly define (in short, I don't guess the rules as most due).\n\nAs we will be staying at the family, on top of learning a bit of Japanese (and if I stay motivated in the long run, I hope more than \"a bit\"), I want to learn about japanese social rule, especially around \"being a guest in a Japanese family\" and \"going to a Japanese wedding\".\n\nObviously, I'm also looking everywhere else for information and not just here, but if anyone already encounter a similar situation I would love some feedback or things I should research that are linked (as an example, I looked into gift giving/receiving as I assumed it will be important if staying at someone house)",

I don't dispute that, and will certainly agree that you should not rely on any information that it gives you.\n\nHowever, while it may not be the best at providing facts, it is a language model, and so it's really good at generating text passages! I know it can be a struggle to find a lot of content that is written at a beginner level, and ChatGPT can certainly help in that regard, in a number of ways. It can generate short stories at varies difficulty levels, in both Japanese and English. It can rewrite articles in easier Japanese. It can generate vocabulary lists for you.\n\nHere are a number of prompts that I have had success with:\n\nCan you write a short story in Japanese that can be understood by a beginner student of the language?\n\nCan you give me a vocabulary list of the most difficult words from that story?\n\nCan you give me another story?\n\nCan you write that story in even simpler Japanese?\n\nCan you write a short story using only the 1000 most common Japanese words?\n\nCan you write a Japanese story that is at N5 level?\n\nCan you write it without kanji?\n\nCan you write a short story in basic Japanese that features characters from Dragonball?\n\nCan you rewrite this article using basic Japanese? &lt;Link to Japanese article&gt;\n\nCan you write a Japanese essay at N5 level about the prevalence of hikikomori in Japan?\n\nCan you write it in the style of a Japanese schoolgirl?\n\nCan you write it in the style of a Yakuza?\n\n\n\nAgain, if you don't rely too much on the content being accurate, or even on it being completely natural, it can be a fun way to generate content to keep yourself busy reading!",
