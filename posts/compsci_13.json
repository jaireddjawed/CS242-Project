Everything is very simple and clear, it seems to me, that there is much more straightforward approach for this purpose, which provide more general result. It's so simple, that it seems like I'm wrong somewhere:\n\nSuppose we have a set of regular expression. Construct an NFA in the following way:\n\nFor each expression build an NFA, such that for each acceptable string there is only one path from the initial state to any of terminal states in it. Then build one cyclic NFA as a disjunction of those, i. e. from new initial state add eps-moves to all initial states of previously constructed NFAs and from all terminal states of previously constructed NFAs add an eps-move to initial state. Make initial state of this complex NFA to the only terminal state of it.\n\nAs far as I understand, this NFA corresponds to the language, consisting of the words, that can be split into the strings accepted by some of the regular expressions, i. e. exactly the language, described in the article. Moreover, disambiguation problem can be reformulated in terms of this NFA in a very simple manner: we want to know, if there exist two different paths from initial state to terminal (i. e. to itself), spelling out the same word. And the latter problem can be easily solved using the same kind of a direct product of an NFA, described in the paper (we should check if there are paths from (init, init) to itself in the graph from p. 7, that go through at least one non-diagonal node).\n\nYes, algorithm from the article is also not too hard, but this one is even simpler. Therefore, it seems to me, that I have missed something important. I'd be very grateful for any idea of what can go wrong here",

All was going well until I encountered the Modified Auto-Contrast Operation.\n\nEssentially, it's to combat the effects of extreme outliers in an image when automatically adjusting the contrast.  From the book: \"We determine two limited values a'lo, a'hi, such that a predefined quantile q\\_lo of all pixel values in the image I are smaller than a'lo and another quantile q\\_hi of the values are greater than a'hi.\"\n\nIt then says that these values are \"easily obtained from the image's cumulative histogram H\"\n\na'lo = min{i | H(i) &gt;= M \\* N \\* p\\_lo}\n\na'hi = max{i | H(i) &lt;= M \\* N \\* (1 - p\\_hi)}\n\nwhere 0 &lt;= p\\_lo, p\\_hi &lt;= 1, p\\_lo + p\\_hi &lt;= 1, and M \\* N is the number of pixels in the image. Values outside a'lo and a'hi are mapped to a minimum and maximum value, respectively, while intermediate values are mapped linearly using this formula:\n\nmin + (a - a'lo) \\* ((max - min) / (a'hi - a'lo))\n\np\\_lo and p\\_hi represent a percentage on either end of the intensity range, where the aforementioned quantile comes into play. They are usually set to the same value, with 0.005 and 0.015 being commonplace.\n\nNow my question is this: how in the hell do I implement this myself? I can't find any resources that discuss this specific problem anywhere online.  I have an idea of how to obtain my cumulative histogram, but that's as far as I get. I understand this on a conceptual level, but I can't seem to figure out how to implement it right.\n\nAny help?",

        "text": "**TL;DR: You can make password hashes arbitrarily long (iterations), incredibly hard to attack, and cost near-zero CPU time for your server if you use trusted execution environments.**\n\nWhat password hashing does: A good, configurable password hash is memory-hard (takes a lot of memory to compute in reasonable time), with serial lanes. When a secure session is established, a user sends an authenticated and encrypted password using the session keys, and the server checks that the password corresponds to the hashed password within a database of salted and hashed passwords.\n\nExample of a [good password hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)\n\nIn the event of an offline attack, the attacker brute forces common passwords off of a wordlist, a.k.a. scraping the \"low-hanging fruit\". Password hashes make this difficult: The attacker creates a worker pool, but due to the memory constraint, their worker pool is bounded by how much main memory they have.\n\nBut this isn't the best we can do: the problem lies in the total \"lanes of computation\". Multithreaded password hashes limit how much an attacker can parallelize an attack, *but this uses significant CPU time on the server.*\n\nEnter the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment):\n\nModern processors have secure sandboxes that cannot be tampered with without an electrical-level attack (which is incredibly difficult to pull off). These sandboxes, a.k.a. enclaves, utilize encrypted memory with hardware-level protection from memory attacks, have their own public/private key pairs with the private key only known to the enclaves, and have a mechanism called \"attestation\" that guarantees that as long as the CPU is trustworthy, it is correctly running the code it is given.\n\nWhen a TEE is told to run a single laned password hash algorithm, even if an attacker were to intercept the machine code and modify it, the serial nature of the algorithm makes it impossible to utilize multiple threads for a single worker. The TEE itself will verify the password the user gives it, and use its private key to send a message to the server about whether the authentication succeeded or not.\n\nNow, the server can configure the password hash to use a lot of memory. The attacker can opt to make multiple worker threads, but the memory requirement will soon become a bottleneck.\n\nSince CPU time is now unlimited (because each user is its own CPU), the iterations parameter can be cranked way up, without the user's processes suffering from starvation because of the serial nature of the algorithm. Logging in for a single user is convenient; offline password cracking is not. The server also saves a lot of CPU time on password hashing: even user account creation can take advantage of the internal private key of the enclave to receive an attested password hash to commit to the database.\n\nOnce the server authenticates the user, the server can now send a temporary authentication tag to the processor (not the enclave). This enables the user to authenticate with the server without going through the enclave for this session.",

As a beginner programming language the 0-based Python is also very often recommended.\n\nThe following examples are especially for beginners better understandable with a 1-based array indexing.\n\n---\n\nOutput all elements of an array in Python:\n\n\ta = [ 2, 3, 8, 11, 4 ]\n\tfor i in range(0, len(a)):\n\t  print(a[i])\n\nin Easylang:\n\n\ta[] = [ 2 3 8 11 4]\n\tfor i = 1 to len a[]\n\t  print a[i]\n\tend\n\n---\n\nOutput the 2nd element in Python:\n\n\tprint(a[1])\n\nsin Easylang:\n\n\tprint a[2]\n\n---\n\nOutput 2nd to 4th element in Python:\n\n\tfor i in range(1, 4):\n\t  print(a[i])\n\nin Easylang:\n\n\tfor i = 2 to 4\n\t  print a[i]\n\tend\n\n---\n\nOutput the elements reverse in Python:\n\n\tfor i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):\n\t  print(a[i])\n\nin Easylang:\n\n\tfor i = len a[] downto 1\n\t  print a[i]\n\tend\n\n---\n\nNow to a concrete algorithm, the **Knuth Shuffle**:\n\nOne goes from the last to the second position. On each pass, a random position including the current position is chosen and this content is swapped with the content at the current position. \n\nIn Python, semi-open areas are unintuitive, especially when moving reverse.\n\nfrom random import randrange\n\n\tx = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ]\n\tfor i in range(len(x) - 1, 0, -1):\n\t\tr = randrange(i + 1)\n\t\tx[i], x[r] = x[r], x[i]\n\n\tprint(x)\n\nThe implementation in Easylang comes closer to the textual pseudocode, which results in a lower cognitive load:\n\n\n\ta[] = [ 10 20 30 40 50 ]\n\tfor i = len a[] downto 2\n\t\tr = random i\n\t\tswap a[i] a[r]\n\tend\n\tprint a[]\n\n---\n\n\n\n**Cons with 1-based arrays**:\n\nYou can't write at position 0, which would be helpful sometimes. Modulo and integer division can lead to 0. ... \n\nDijkstra is often referred: [Dijkstra: Why numbering should start at zero](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD831.PDF)\n\nMany algorithms are shown with 0-based arrays.",

        "text": "'No', 'nothing', and 'other' are three fundamental concepts with various manifestations in computer science. Coming from a JavaScript background &amp; since it's a common language, I'll use the notation primarily for examples though mixing in other languages. (This post also fangles `inline code formatting`, mis-/imperceptible to Old Redditors.) \n\nLet's start with 'other'. In any set of elements that represent a domain (e.g. letters in an alphabet), there inherently exists a concept of 'things outside of the domain', or 'undefined'. This kind of other, as usually's the case in programming language, can be represented by a symbol/keyword `undefined`. In a sense, `undefined` *is* a part of the language's domain being an explicit keyword, so there's also an unspoken 'undefined', which may be called 'unknown', 'ignored', or 'out of scope' which represents any element of the set beyond the domain. `undefined` *represents* 'unknown'/'ignored'/'out of scope' but is not identical. Furthermore &amp; similarly, there is the common concept of 'exceptions' which represent an unhandleable/edge/corner cases. Exception may either be further unspecified (in many languages, `Exception`)—in which case it is conceptually identical to `undefined` if not in practice/implementation—or further subtyped (e.g. (.NET's) `DivideByZeroException` or `TimeoutException`). Exceptions are said to be *thrown* and either *caught* or *unhandled* (bubbling up to some built-in error response). Subtypes of exceptions are conceptually like chart&amp;symbolizing the `undefined` space.\n\nMoving on, 'nothing' can take the form of `null` which stands for 'empty' or 'ungiven'. In practice there are two kinds—implicit defaulted-to null (e.g. when a user does not give input and the program then assumes) &amp; explicit null (intentionally chosen). Perhaps a better/handy term for 'implicit null' is *unchosen*; in a way 'implicit null' is the same as 'variable' (a kind of (to-be-determined) nothing). That being said, *unchosen* (implicit null), *variable* &amp; *unconsidered* (implicit undefined) are fundamentally synonymous. To recap, here are the concepts introduced so far:\n\n* Other (a.k.a. *unknown*, *undefined, unconsidered,* *ignored*, *out of scope*, *variable*)\n   * Implicit other (inherently unsymbolized)\n   * Explicit other (`undefined`/`Exception`/`let x;`; inherently symbolized)\n      * Explicit other subtypes (e.g. `OutOfMemoryException`)\n* (Explicit) nothing (a.k.a. `null`; may be thought as or called *nothing*, *empty*)\n\n'Nothing' can take more specific forms when constrained to smaller domains:\n\n* `0` qua quantity\n* `\"\"` (empty string) qua text\n   * Note `\"0\"` is not nothing or `0`\n* `0` (or `false`) qua boolean\n* `{}` (null set)\n* `[]` (empty array)\n   * Note strings are conceptually kinds of arrays\n* `noop` qua functions\n   * Can be thought of as nothing qua verb whereas `null`'s nothing qua noun\n   * E.g. `()=&gt;{}` in JavaScript (which btw returns `undefined`)\n* `Void` qua functions (e.g. Java)\n   * Basically specifies lack of output of functions, or conceptually functions that map to `undefined`.\n\nNote that while these symbols *may* and *customarily* symbolize nothing, they theoretically *could* symbolize or be treated as non-nothing values (the same can be said for `undefined` and `null`). E.g. in JavaScript, `let x = {[undefined]: \"a\", [null]: \"b\"};` or `let f = x=&gt;x===undefined ? \"a\" : x===null ? \"b\" : undefined;` Conceptually these nothings are kinds of but not identical to `null`. Considering analogy `null` : `0`/`\"\"`/`false`/`[]` :: `undefined` : `DivideByZero`/`Timeout`/`OutOfMemoryException`, 'nothing' can be seen as a kind of 'other' in restricted domain of symbols, primitives, &amp; objects. The list of concepts has shrunk to:\n\n* Implicit other\n* Explicit other &amp; its various subtypes.\n\nA final note is with booleans, which represent a set of two values e.g. {`no`, `yes`}, {`0`, `1`}, {`false`, `true`}. Since it's fundament/theoretic-ally arbitrary what these labels are, they perhaps(?) may even be represented as {`null`, `undefined`} (e.g. by having boolean operations expect&amp;process these value accordingly) for syntactic simplicity. Likewise, `0`, `\"\"`, `{}`, `[]`, `noop`, and `Void` may(?) all be represented as `undefined`. (Those two (?)'s are tentative speculation; criticism/investigation welcome.)\n\nRisking further speculation, implicit other, the explicit-other supertype, and explicit-other subtypes can be reframed respectively as:\n\n* Other\n* Anything\n* Something (in particular)\n\n*May this reduce/eliminate suffering of &amp; benefit all beings.*",
