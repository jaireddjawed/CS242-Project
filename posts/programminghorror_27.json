Now he's sold part of his company to another in need of his product and he receives part of the profit.  From that standpoint he's doing well, and I enjoy consulting with him.\nTo date, he has a few thousand people using his app.  Let's just say it's in a pretty niche market, and those who would pay to use it are willing to pay a premium so things balances out.\n\n**The App**\n\nFrank uses PHP and MySQL without a framework and without an ORM.

I keep thinking about how this thing is going to grow larger and larger and one day he's going to hire a dedicated programmer and this is what they're going to have to work with.  I keep thinking in my mind how hard it would be to build it up from scratch again; every new feature he adds makes it more and more unlikely.\n\nIn hindsight, it makes sense why Frank did what he did.  Frank's friend knew PHP and MySQL, but now his friend has moved on.\n\nHere are some things that have come up:\n\n  - Poor code formatting and no comments.\n  - This lovely code snippet used to log in:\n\n        $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n    \t$salt = sha1(md5($password));\n    \t$password = md5($salt . $password);\t    \n\n  - Poor database performance?

        "text": "So I had a lab that was a practice for an SBA (Skill-Based Assessment) in college for C programming on my second year. (This is our first time approaching C in the college program).\n\nHe wanted us to write a small \"high/low\" guessing game from a linux terminal with a bit of a spin:\n\nThe rundown of the program is that asks for a string, and the program will convert it to a sum of the integer equivalence of each char. Then you have to guess what the ASCII equivalent sum is for that string.\n-\nSince it wasn't an actual lab and wasn't being graded, I did it for practice, like suggested. It's fair enough, right? But here's the kicker: \n\n#He told us to use the gets() function\n\nSo I shared my concerns about it by e-mail:\n\n\n&gt; Hi, D[redacted]\n\n&gt; I was working on the Lab 4 practice SBA and I came across a compiler warning for the gets() function. It is a deprecated and dangerous function to use because it doesn't check for buffer overrun (Sounds like a serious exploit to me). It then suggested I use the newer function fgets(). This is just something I found out. The compiler still ran using the deprecated gets(), but using the new function will make it work in a safer way.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I read the man page for gets() and this was its BUGS section:*\n&gt; \n&gt;     $ man gets\n&gt;     [...]\n&gt;     BUGS\n&gt; \n&gt;     Never use gets(). Because it is impossible to tell without knowing the data in advance how many characters gets() will read, and because gets() will continue to store characters past the end of the buffer, it is extremely dangerous to use. It has been used to break computer security. Use fgets() instead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just something to point out, really. I looked at the arguments for fgets() and it isn't hard to use it:\n&gt; char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream)\n&gt; *s is the string it will store the input, size is the buffer size, and *stream is the file input stream (in this case it would be stdin).\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be useful to point this out to everyone on Monday's lecture before the SBA. It will clear the heads of the people who saw the warning and didn't know what to do with it.\n&gt; Looks like this is not a good \"it's not a bug, but a feature\" case :P\n\n\nA student naturally expressing concerns, no biggie right? \n\nThis was his response:\n-\n&gt; V,\n&gt; \n&gt; As with any language more than a few years old, certain parts of the language are deprecated.  Most of HTML 1.0 is deprecated, but there are still a billion lines of old code floating around there, and no one seems too concerned.  Yes, gets() is deprecated.  But its also still lives on in a billion lines of code.  So students need to know about it.  Use fgets() if it helps you sleep at night.\n&gt; \n&gt; D\n\n\nThe amount of cringe I had and currently am having is off the charts.\nMy response to that, after I finally stopped flipping my shit all over the room:\n-\n&gt; Okay... although deprecated code exists in many languages, many programmers update and adapt to make sure the newer and more secure features are available to use on their programs. If no one cared about gets(), or things with that level of security flaws, there would be a lot of exploitable programs out there. (look at what happened to OpenSSL and its Heartbleed bug, and Shellshock bash). \n\n\nHe hasn't replied to me yet :V\n\nOh and for another interesting story. My first assignment for this course had us write some pseudocode for operating an elevator. We'll be writing the C code for it in the last assignment of the course, but the fun part is when he goes and tells me, seconds apart from this conversation, that my PDF submission was empty and that his Adobe Reader was giving him an error. I tested this on my own computer, on a friend's computer, all my PDF-compatible programs including Firefox and Chrome, and they all loaded the file without a hitch.\n\nCompetent teaching at its finest, guys.\n-",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/2twh9h/the_great_smallcaps_hack_of_2014/",
        "text": "Decided to stop lurking to share with you guys my absolute favorite, nastiest hack I ever wrote. It's pretty involved, so please bear with me.\n\nAs part of my job, I found myself writing a content editor for one of my organization's websites. There was a very specific, rather interesting requirement for this editor: it absolutely, positively HAD to support small-caps. I'm not sure how many WYSIWYG HTML editors I tested, but it was a lot, and of course none of them support small-caps. I finally settled on the Guardian's very nice [Scribe editor](https://github.com/guardian/scribe) and resigned myself to adding support for small-caps myself.\n\nAdding a button to turn text into small-caps was easy. The hard part was the reverse: removing the small-caps formatting when you click the button a second time.\n\n**Problem #1:** the editor doesn't support adding/removing markup like\n\n    &lt;span class=\"small-caps\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n, only bare tags.\n\n**Solution:** appropriate the &lt;strike&gt; tag (which I didn't have to support) and use it as a fake small-caps element within the editor (the resulting HTML gets processed later anyway).\n\n    strike {\n      text-decoration: none;\n      font-variant: small-caps;\n    }\n\n**Problem #2:** the editor refuses to remove the &lt;strike&gt; tag if the small-caps styling is being applied to it, either by inline css or a stylesheet. Sigh.\n\n**Solution:** *cleverly managed* inline css. First, watch the DOM for the appearance of wild strike tags and smite them with small-caps on sight:\n\n    new MutationSummary({\n      rootNode: $('#editor'),\n      queries: [{ element: 'strike' }],\n      callback: function() {\n          $('strike').css({ 'text-decoration': 'none', 'font-variant': 'small-caps' });\n      }\n    });\n\nThen, if the user clicks the button again to make the small-caps/strike go away, remove the css first:\n\n    $('#small-caps-button').click(function() {\n      selection = window.getSelection();\n      selectionParent = selection.anchorNode.parentNode;\n    \n      if (selectionParent.nodeName == 'STRIKE') {\n        selectionParent.removeAttribute('style');\n      }\n    });\n\n**Problem #3:** the editor *still* refuses to remove the &lt;strike&gt; unless the whole inner text is selected. COME ON.\n\n**Solution:** if the caret is sitting in a strike tag when the user hits the button, select all of its text.\n\n    $('#small-caps-button').click(function() {\n      selection = window.getSelection();\n      selectionParent = selection.anchorNode.parentNode;\n    \n      if (selectionParent.nodeName == 'STRIKE') {\n        selectionParent.removeAttribute('style');\n    \n        range = new Range\n        range.selectNodeContents(selectionParent)\n        selection.addRange(range)\n      }\n    });\n\n**Problem #4:** this code needs to run before the editor's code that removes the &lt;strike&gt; tag. No chance of tampering with the editor's event listeners.\n\n**Solution:** this all sucks already, might as well go all in. Add a *second, invisible button* on top of the editor's button to capture the click event, run my code, and trigger a click on the button beneath it:\n\n    &lt;!-- HTML -- &gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"small-caps-wrapper\"&gt;\n      &lt;button id=\"small-caps-button\"&gt;Small Caps&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button id=\"small-caps-overlay\"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n    /* CSS */\n    #small-caps-wrapper {\n      position: relative;\n    }\n    \n    #small-caps-overlay {\n      position: absolute;\n      top: 0;\n      left: 0;\n      width: 100%;\n      height: 100%;\n      z-index: 100;\n      background: transparent;\n      border: none;\n    }\n    \n    // JS\n    $('#small-caps-overlay').click(function() {\n      selection = window.getSelection();\n      selectionParent = selection.anchorNode.parentNode;\n    \n      if (selectionParent.nodeName == 'STRIKE') {\n        selectionParent.removeAttribute('style');\n    \n        range = new Range\n        range.selectNodeContents(selectionParent)\n        selection.addRange(range)\n      }\n    \n      $('#small-caps-button').trigger('click');\n    });\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how I implemented small-caps in my content editor (in production, btw). Best. Hack. Ever.\n\n**tl;dr:** if someone asks you to implement small-caps in an HTML editor, just say no.",

        "text": "I am here on a Saturday night to go at lengh about one of the most fucked up coding ANTI PATTERNS there ever is. I've been dealing with this all week, I feel like hitting my head against the wall right now.\n\nSO here's the gist of it, step by step\n\n1) There is some overelaborate \"architecture\" that relies on stuff being done automatically, either by callbacks, or inheritance, or say some automatic ORM thing etc. etc.\n\n2) Usually these pieces of shit become a \"callback hell\", especially if the assignment of functionality is done the \"single inheritance\" way, or by \"expecting that everything will just work\"\n\n3) At some point the convoluted bullshit of calls does something you do not want it to do\n\n4) Right now it is apparent that the architecture is wrong. You should change things while you still can.\n\n5) However \"management\" is usually people with a hard ass work ethic and shit, they are all about efficiency, they need a fast simple fix to it.\n\n6) Some jackass comes over, steps through the debugger, and just adds flags that stop the control flow whenever he sees it does something it shouldn't\n\n7) He repeats that shit until he can't see any errors. Notice that no thought went into this, it's really just the debugger doing all the work\n\n8) A few weeks later another case of the above. After a day stepping and \"patching\" with the debugger, and thankfully without any \"collisions\" with the first flag, the program seems to run again\n\n9) Two months later a third variable appears. However it is starting to collide with what the others where blocking. Right now you really have 8+ 1 day runs through the debugger to check. It's getting out of control. After a botched up 2 day job you (probably) have managed to make it work again\n\n10) Finally the fourth flag comes up. Except right now nothing works. You don't even understand wtf is going on. You forgot the whole context and all you see is magical flags that look like some genius mastermind with 190 IQ, some kind of creator deity, some personification of Reason, put all that stuff in there with grace and thoughtfulness, except it was just some idiot that was playing with the debugger and right now has no clue what the hell his shit is supposed to be doing. \n\nThings get blocked or cause random exceptions at unrelated parts of the code. A problem that was conceptually, requirements wise, and software design wise if you did things right, pretty fucking staightforawrd, has turned into something like solving a rubik cube. Any change could actually destroy another 10 parts of the program. Any change would probably be blocked by something one way or another. Any attempt to understand what the program is doing would really require a week debugging and documenting all the routes of something that is just plain wrong.\n\nThe fuck is wrong with this flying spaghheti monster code.",

I met owner of community and few guys that were volunteers for maintenance of CoD servers, Apache server for official website of community, MySQL databases and software called B3 bot. B3 bot was a software used to ease management of player status (to register players, to ban players etc.). One day guy called Tom joined our community. He was a student of software  engineering. Tom was known as a joker in that gaming community and guy that likes to \"stick his nose\" everywhere. One day, Tom wrote to me something like this: \"Hey! I found that one of your page is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.\" First I thought he was joking. But after I saw what he did, I realized that his claims are true. There was an SQL injection vulnerability in one of input fields for search of banned players on public ban list. I called guy known as JMD to explain me what was the issue. JMD was creator of that page. He was the guy that worked in IT industry. I repeat: He was the guy that worked in IT industry! He was considered as most competitive among volunteers. \nHe just wrote: \"I fixed it.\"\nI asked: \"How?\" \nHe replied: \"//\"\nWhich meant that he just commented malicious code. After that, I was called by other volunteer that maintained official website and he told me that they have web application hosted on their server written by JMD. Software was called QB3, written in PHP and it was used as a tool to query database used by B3 bot. I didn't know for that software. He asked me whether I could \"inspect\" QB3. I'm not that familiar with PHP since my primary programming language is Java. But I could definitely tell him if code was vulnerable on SQL injection attacks or not. He sent me only one script. I stumbled when I found seven queries vulnerable on SQL injection attacks in that single PHP script! That guy JMD was not using anything in his code to prevent SQL injection attacks. I immediately contacted him to tell him about his malicious code. \nHe told me something like this: \"I know! QB3 is not supposed to be accessed by everyone!\" \nI just \"facepalmed\" myself.\nAfter that, he removed his software from use and owner of community was actually mad at me. ",

        "text": "We're doing high-performance realtime 3d rendering, under a tight budget and a tight schedule. Fun times! I work well in these conditions, so it really is fun.\n\nI'm gonna call our object \"Renderable\". Renderable might have the actual model swapped out from under it. There's a function which is, basically, \"update the state of the model\", which, long ago in the program's history, was called every frame, and updated the model every frame. Nice, clean, simple, slow. As often happens in this industry, simplicity takes a back seat to performance.\n\nThe actual \"update\" process was the slow bit, but this is easy to deal with. There are really only a few relevant values on the model that get changed, so we cache the most recent values we've seen and update the model only if the new values are different. Nice, slightly less clean, simple, not fast enough.\n\nSee, even determining *which values to set* turned out to be kind of expensive as well. Polling sucks; we all know polling sucks; so instead of calling the update function every frame, we call it every time something might have changed. This is actually pretty fast, and worked fine for years, through several major releases, through a bunch of revenue, through one rendering engineer being fired and another one quitting and then me taking the reins of this whole thing.\n\nWhat you should get out of the above paragraph is that nobody left at the company understands why the old code was written the way it is. Everything I wrote up there? Pure conjecture. That's what the code looks like, that's what I'm assuming happened, could be wrong.\n\nUnfortunately . . . it's not *quite* that simple.\n\nSee, when we change models, it turns out we *also* set the cached values to several hardcoded values. Why those values? Damned if I know! And it turns out that there's a special flag such that the *first time* you call the update function on a given Renderable, regardless of which model it has, it does something totally different. Why? Damned if I know!\n\nThe bug, after literally days of poring through debug output, adding more debug output, GOTO 10, turned out to be those hardcoded values. We'd set a new model; it would hardcode values; those values would *by unfortunate coincidence* be the same values that it was expecting to set the new model to, so it would assume that, hey, the new model must already have the right values, we're good, everyone go home.\n\nBut the new model didn't have the right values, so everything broke.\n\nFix.\n\nAdded a new flag that says \"ignore the damn cached values, just update shit\". Set it on model change. I carefully nestled it next to the scary \"ignore what you're supposed to do and do something else, but only once\" flag. The new flag's going live soon; as soon as QA says it's working, the scary flag, and all references to it, are getting deleted. What was its purpose? Damned if I know! Will removing it break things? ~~Damned if I know~~ ~~Probably~~ Damned if I know! But we've got a few months until the next public release and with luck QA will find whatever I broke so I can implement it in a better way.\n\nFun times.",

Well, okay, everyone makes mistakes when typing, it's quite common to switch letters around. I'm not a fan of using underlines instead of camelCase, but meh, his code, his standards. I assumed the code might be failing, since he didn't correct the variable name.\n\nBut no, the code works fine. Instead of correcting the name of the variable, he instead mistyped (on purpose, because of the first mistake?) every instance of the variable in question.\n\na few cases:  \n`if ($page_sideabr_position){`\n\n`&lt;?php echo $page_sideabr_position; ?&gt;`\n\n`$page_sideabr_position = get_post_meta(`\n\nI'm impressed.

        "text": "I had this friend once who admittedly was a bit weird but we infrequently played chess and talked about our careers and he seemed okay. Out of nowhere one day came a series of emails which spiralled into insanity and ended our friendship. Here's a summary of them:\n\nWF: **\"Do you know ... well ... this CSS stuff?\"** In the email WF said he was working on a portfolio website. He wants it to go BAM and needed help making only minor adjustments.\n\nMe: **\"I am busy.\"** I told him it sounded like a fun project but I have two jobs and I'm a full time student so I can't volunteer my time right now. WF's requests sounded really minor but I knew better than to get involved because projects like this tend to explode. I asked to see what he has so far.\n\nWF:  **\"I can show you in person only, cuz for one thing it's not live.\"** Cool, so he's using a noob web tool and doesn't have access to his files. \"Come on Zulban, throw me like an hour you animal!\" Now he explains how he also needs help with SEO, \"fine details stuff\", layouts, pages, content... not a small job.\n\nMe: **\"Yeah sorry I'm not going to work for you for free :/\"** I then explained that this is like asking your friend to clean your toilet because they're a janitor. I didn't make any serious estimations or talk dollar amounts because I knew he wasn't looking for that. I also suggested that he can't estimate an hour accurately because he doesn't know how to solve his problems.\n\nWhat follows was 1100 words of swearing, drama, claims of betrayal, lecturing, guilt-tripping, belittling, etc. 1100 words is twice the length of this post. Here is the gist:\n\nWF: **\"Your email fucking pissed me off.\"** Apparently I'm a soulless friend who tries to monetize everything. WF says he knows nothing about CSS but this job would take even *him* just an hour! \"Either you don't know CSS, CSS is shit, or you are an idiot.\" The work is 20 minutes tops! It would be fine if I just said I could do it later. WF thinks he has a better life outlook because he's older. Life isn't about money money money. Remember that small favour WF did for my friend? Well WF isn't saying I owe WF but...\n\nMe: **\"Holy shit man.\"** I didn't ask for money, I just said no. If you think it's so easy, please learn CSS yourself. Next time you ask a friend for a favour, treat it like a favour, and not a demand.\n\nAt this point WF somehow managed to start a debate about who said what and who meant what, quoting relentlessly, with me hardly replying. After I got a 400 word email from WF:\n\nMe: **\"I'm sorry, I'm really done with this. I did not read this email.\"**\n\nWF kept sending a few emails. At one point he brought up a girl from my past who I hardly dated. I'm still struggling to figure out how she fit into all this. Eventually he asked that we meet to have a chat face to face for \"just 15 minutes\" to smooth things out.\n\nMe: **\"Dude, I am busy. How many times do I have to repeat myself?\"** What the fuck man, I'm a full time student during mid terms with two jobs. I do not want to talk to you about drama that only exists in your mind.\n\nHaven't gotten a reply yet. I'm super happy I did not involve myself with this project from the start. Remember folks: do not do free tech work for friends and family. They may turn out to be nut cases.",

He had been working with an online storefront we had purchased from another company, and was preparing it for in-house deployment. \n\nThe storefront was breaking when a new category was added. After poking around, he found that the page would load, then request the list of categories from the server. The server would then send the list, and the page would process it. Sounds ok right?\n\nNope. \n\nThe entire list was sent as a string. with no delimiters. Meaning it was sent: \"item1item2item3\" and the webpage handled it. with a single JavaScript regex. \n\nLet me say that again, instead of splitting the words in the string, there was a regex, dedicated to splitting over 30 categories apart. Tears were shed, and a Scottish lunch discussed (I don't know if that happened, was under 21 at the time).",

The structure for the table that each business is in, can be found below.\n\nI've done my best to remove anything that could identify me. The story of how this table got this way began almost 10 years ago (5 years before I started) Originally an open source directory app, it was reverse-engineered by our CTO into something we could claim our own. (much of the original source remains)\n\nThis guy knows very little about databases and programming. The best he can do is copy other's work and change it just enough to fit his needs. (with varying levels of success) His development process can be summed up as this:\n\n* Decide a new feature is needed\n* Conclude that if it is not fully developed within a week the company could lose $32,000-$200,000\n* Spend no time planning\n* Add columns to the database to hold new data\n* Copy+paste code from other portions of the app and change variable names to match the new columns\n* Ignore other coders pleading him to not add more columns to the table\n* Dismiss advice from other coders on the proper way to arrange code/data\n* Talk down and be condescending to everyone despite not knowing entry-level PHP/HTML/CSS\n* Present his new creation to sales staff and convince them he's a savant\n\nHere's a structure dump for the table:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/ArC89a7D\n\nAfter 5 years my nagging seems to have taken hold. We're normalizing over the weekend, so this one might just get a happy ending.",

        "text": "Consider this, I found on a host of websites owned by William Hill (a massive multinational). It is supposed to prevent clickjacking but do these web developers understand thier craft at all or even test the implementation themselves with a clickjack software or service? likely not. \n\nOk the code snippet;\n\n&gt; &lt;style id=\"antiClickjack\"&gt;\n&gt; body {\n&gt;   display: none !important;\n? }\n&gt; &lt;/style&gt;\n&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n&gt; if (self === top) {\n&gt;   var antiClickjack = document.getElementById(\"antiClickjack\");\n&gt;   antiClickjack.parentNode.removeChild(antiClickjack);\n&gt; } else {\n&gt;   top.location = self.location;\n&gt; }\n&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n\nSo, any programmer must know that css style wont effect my scrapping efforts if i visit websites without any browser (rendering engine) so using display:none on the body will only hide content when rendered by a browser, in which case the javascript itself can and will also be parsed and executed for at least one of the clickjack software/service runs at your site.\n\nSo dumbfounding.\n\nThey've also tried simple prevention methods that are easily busted, such as;\n* X-Frame-Options\n* frame detection and reload\n\nSome might think that non-static x,y location placements of elements across pages is the only anticlickjack method that actually works, but even good hackers bust it using simple Javascript to get the element and figure out the element x,y location to then simulate clicking.\n\nOther than human mind problem solving using CAPTCHA there is no anticlickjack method that actually works, period. So dont try, it makes you look really young, uninformed, or just stuck in the 90s.",

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nI am currently digging through a system that is transitioning ownership from an outside consulting firm to an internal team. Right now we're trying to extend it with new parts, and fix the old parts.\n\nWhat I found is that one of the system's many features is the ability to bind a list with a field of any arbitrary record. Each list is, itself, its own record in the database. So you could do something like a list of product types, and when you retrieve a record from the ORM layer, it would join the matching product type to the product.\n\nThis is all fine and dandy, as any ORM layer worth its guts should be able to join relating records. Another thing the system does is that when it builds the form for a record, it will present the list for the field as a drop-down. So for that product, the types you have listed in the product types list will be listed in the drop down.\n\nThis is all of dubious benefit really, but I digress.\n\nWhere things went into crazy town is when the outside consulting firm began using lists as a short-cut for creating drop downs.\n\nExample tables:\n\n- A list called 'Yes/No'. It stores the strings 'Yes' or 'No'.\n- A list called 'Integer Numbers'. It stores the numbers 1 to 50, indexed 1 to 50.\n- A list called 'Days of the week'. It stores seven values (take a guess).",

        "text": "In the 90's I worked as a paid intern for a smallish company. The platform was a PICK database system that used a flavor of BASIC for applications. It was a pretty strange and antiquated setup even for that era, considering the \"server\" was 486/50MHz machine with a junction box that split out to dozens of dummy terminals communicating via 9600 baud cables. Hey, it worked, and it got me some real-world experience.\n\nBut this O/S was so bad. It had issues like \"compiled\" applications could not exceed 32kb. Yes, kilobytes. I once had to split an app into two because it had overgrown this barrier and so I used some trickery to get the apps to appear to run concurrently without interrupting the workflow the users were used to.\n\nThe most egregious fault of this system was that it was terribly insecure. Usernames and passwords were limited to 8 characters and no numbers or symbols. Usernames were typically the first name of the person which led to problems when you had 5 employees with the name \"Dave\". Being one of the few in-house developers, I had access to everything except the admin account for the server. I was carefully instructed not to misuse my powers as the VP's had carelessly stored HR and payroll info on the server. As a power user, I could also do other dumb tricks like take over a user's session and type on their terminal remotely, which was good for a prank at best, and at worst it could be used to spy on people's activities while they worked.\n \nThe absolute worst thing I discovered one day while I was trolling through the file-system/database one day, I discovered a table called \"Failed Logins\". To my horror/delight, the table listed failed login attempts with the username and the password attempt in *plain text*. Now, I don't know about you, but I often typo my credentials a few times a week depending on how tired I am or if I'm in a hurry. It seemed like everyone else did the same, and I could clearly guess the real password of every user on the system within a minute of searching this table. I got a really terrible idea and made a bet with my fellow programmer that I could guess his password by reading his mind. I made a big show of standing with my back to him while he logged in then logged back out. I then logged in using his credentials which I had deduced from my earlier scan. I quickly realized I probably shouldn't go around showing off this new ability lest it get me in trouble. \n\n",

        "text": "I'll refrain from giving out any information that could identify the company.\n\nI worked for this company 4 years ago. The company massive government contracts, and had the software written by interns fresh out of college without any experience. After being there a year I got promoted to Lead Developer, which was mostly a way of them pretending they cared about their employees.\n\nThe company was completely focused on demos. They would wine and dine the people making buying decisions, and then fail to fully implement most features after the contracts got signed. Much of the dev team spent their times manually updating records in the Prod database and doing hotfixes for things that were never implemented correctly.\n\nThe company has this JSP that that had hard-coded database connections and queries to load a giant table into a model. They would import it into other JSPs when they needed the model. We actually had a situation where we hit max lines for JSPs because so much importing was used. Apparently if a JSP gets too large Java will throw a \"Code too large for try-catch block\" when trying to compile it. I dunno if this was fixed in newer versions of java.\n\nEverything was built using EJBs. We had some legacy code that built entire EJBs for things like loading a list of states. We also had EJBs that were massive walls of code full of global variables. People would throw code in them when they got tired of setting up new EJBs because there was so much overhead in setting one up.\n\nThe java session was massively over-used. It's basically a global hashmap thats scoped so that each users data is separated based on a session id. Different parts of the application happened to use similar variables names, which meant that if you were logged in for too long you would get random errors due to data bleeding from different pats of the application. These errors would generally happen inside EJBs, which meant your session was invalidated. That 3000 field form you were trying to fill out? Yeah all that data was stored in your session, so your hours of work just got lost. Yes, you have to re-log in and start entering all that data again.\n\nThe CEOs called the dev team up on a Friday night and mandated that everyone worked without days off until we finished a major demo they needed. This was probably the worst possible move they could have done, as team moral plummeted as well as code quality. The more time we spent in the office the less we got done. After a month of not having days off I quit. Looking back, I wish I had known how abusive the company was. As this was my first job out of college, I thought I was making good money so I was willing to put up with way too much shit.",

For a little over a year I was the entire QA department at a startup that tried/is trying to make a \"semantic, socially driven, product-centric search engine with a 3d semantic database\". Their words.\n\nThis post is about the embarrassing state of the product data we had. For too long, the R&amp;D team put just one \"programmer\" in charge of the crucial task of writing a web crawler to collect this data. To her credit, she appeared to genuinely try and she cared about her work. Furthermore, the programming language chosen for her was a crippled, experimental, dead language that deserves its own post. Having said that... Before being hired she admitted to never having seriously programmed anything before. For months, her crawler code was a single giant function. Clearly, no reasonable person would have ever assigned this enormous and challenging task to her. But that was our head of R&amp;D.\n\nAfter more than a year of development these were the results: \n* We had HTML code in our product descriptions.\n\n* Product titles were sometimes tens of thousands of characters in length.\n\n* Text in general was riddled with unprintable characters and encoding errors of the most exotic variety.\n\n* English and French data were always jumbled. It is not difficult to very effectively guess English/French, by the way.\n\n* As QA I don't recall ever getting a version that compiled. All I could test was the trickle of nonsense data it sometimes produced.\n\n* After downloading a web site, if it failed to parse or just crashed, it had to re-download the web site.\n\n* At best producing fifty products a month, a human being could have outpaced it by orders of magnitude by copy and pasting data from retailer websites.\n\nAgain, that’s after a year.\n\nWe've come to a point in my story where you may have trouble believing how delusional some employees at this company were. I heard the phrase \"we're going to be the next Google\" more than once. One time I did a spot test and estimated that 70% of the data was garbage - but the web crawler was still celebrated because it produced more data than usual that month. We had \"hype\" meetings where management and the R&amp;D lead talked about how great everything is going and how we (they) are all going to be rich. Meanwhile, the product title for a hammer was:\n\n    &lt;span class=\"product-badge\"&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"product-badge__image\"/&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"/en/pdp/stanley-fatmax-xtreme-antivibe-hammer-20oz-0574004p.html\" class=\n\nAnd its product description was forty thousand characters of whitespace.\n\nAnyway, after I had been there nearly a year two things happened. I was given a chance to write my own web crawler! This deserves its own post. Also, they hired a new programmer to work on the existing web crawler. That poor bastard didn't stand a chance though. He didn't really have the option of saying \"holy shit, we need to start from scratch\" during his probationary period.\n\nIt took just two weeks under these new conditions for management to have \"hype\" meetings. They announced without consulting either of us that by Monday, our web crawlers could hit a dozen websites a week and generate data for hundreds of thousands of products...\n",

        "text": "I've got another gem about [my previous employer](http://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/2jyqxu/we_dont_do_version_control_here/). For a little over a year I was the entire QA department at a start up that tried/is trying to make a \"semantic, socially driven, product-centric search engine with a 3d semantic database\". Their words.\n\nOne huge challenge I faced was how to objectively confront the insanity of the search results. If you searched for \"television\" and the second result was a bottle of wine, there was always a bullshit justification from the head of R&amp;D. Something like \"the system is still learning\" or \"the data is bad\" or even \"bottles of wine are on television a lot\" (their words). If you think the first two justifications sound reasonable, know that the search results were schizophrenic for over a year, long before I even started working there. The search algorithm was failing to perform even the most basic keyword searches and the justification was always that the system is too smart, or it's learning, or it's someone else's fault.\n\nWorse still, if you found a particularly egregious failure, like searching \"socks\" and the third result is \"Mein Kampf\" by Hitler, just that one search term would \"get fixed\" with the next patch. But in no time at all you'd find another sensible search term with ludicrous results. This process repeated itself dozens of times. I swear, I **swear**, the head of R&amp;D had some way to scramble the results randomly between the daily patches.\n\nHow do you measure the quality of search results? Surely only a human being can do that? Or, wouldn't I have to write my own search engine to compare to? Nope. Enter: \"the Hitler test\".\n\nFirst I searched for \"Hitler\". I collected a list of some fifty items that were blatantly Hitler themed: books he wrote or books with him on the cover. Next, I made a long list of fluffy happy search terms like \"rainbow\", \"celine dion\",  \"bicycle\", and \"children's books\". Then I wrote a tool that automatically searched for fluffy terms, and reported back to me when the results were Hitler-esque. From then on the jig was up:\n\n    Me: When I search \"elvis\", the ninth result is Mein Kampf.\n    R&amp;D team: Oh! That was the old version. We just released a better one.\n    Me (1 minute later): Hello again. When I search \"pink unicorn\", the third result is Mein Kampf.\n\nI'd like to say this helped. That after a year the CEO and CTO saw the error of their ways and put different seniors in charge. But frankly this company was so delusional that I have trouble talking about my work history there. I wouldn't believe some of my own stories had I not experienced them first hand. Anyway, I was really proud of this solution. I came up with a way to test the quality of search engine results automatically. Not bad!",

        "text": "For a little over a year I was the entire QA department at a start up that tried/is trying to make a \"semantic, socially driven, product-centric search engine with a 3d semantic database\". Their words. My first few months I had to fight vigorously to get the team for the search engine to use any kind of version control at all. At first there was nothing - they just put files on the dev/test/production server without asking or telling anyone else in the company. No isolated test server/instance for me. No repos of any kind. Eventually they started using git, and the \"versions\" I requested were commit hashes. There were of course dozens if not hundreds of commits a day. So if I ever came to them with a list of bugs, the immediate answer without hesitation was \"that's an old version, we fixed those bugs already\" without even having a look at what I found.\n\nAfter months I still had no way to test this software in an isolated environment I controlled. There was literally zero installation documentation and it required a server. I was also a junior, so really all I could do is ask.\n\nAfter one particularly heated exchange I finally got this gem from the head of R&amp;D, the company's PhD buzzword kingpin:\n\n    Hahaha! You don't understand our system. We *can't* give you versions of our code.\n    We don't do version control here. It doesn't work like that, we just can't.\n\nPerhaps after six months of pleading then demanding I had proper versioning. I also had a huge number of other problems of course, and still no isolated test server/instance. But I had versioning...",

I just discovered that one of the drop down menus in the IDE (labeled \"build\") makes a server call when you open it. Every time. So if a server is down or congested then you can't build things because the goddamned menu won't open and eventually times out. This is actually a common thing throughout all of our tools. Simple GUI actions synchronously make server calls. Which could possibly be tolerable if the calls were fast, but things often takes several seconds and it eats up so much potential productivity over the day.\n\nEven worse, our entire shitty ancient architecture is built around using floating point for currency values. It would probably take years to fix it - not that such a thing would be considered given that when I ask anyone why the fuck it's like this, they just give me a blank stare.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg at a company that is the largest in its industry.
