        "text": "If you search for Discovery or Picard in television, scifi, or any of the other Trek subreddits, you get honest opinions. To say these shows have mixed reviews would be kind.\n\nBut as anyone who has spent any time in the startrek subreddit knows, if you say anything even remotely unflattering about Paramount's new shows specifically, you can expect a ban. You can make fun of Dr Crusher having a relationship with a candle, or Paris turning into a salamander, but if you make fun of a Kelpian manbaby having a tantrum and destroying all the dilithium in the universe, you're gone. It's a joke at this point that if you go into an episode discussion thread, it will be a graveyard of removed comments. I myself got a temp ban once just for asking \"what's with all the removed comments?\" I've heard dozens of similar stories from other Redditors.\n\nThe reason for the censorship is Paramount. Paramount employees are likely acting directly as mods, and other mods have been invited to red carpet events and likely have been compensated in other ways.\n\nDiscovery was recently cancelled, and it's funny to see the discussion thread - people walking on eggshells trying to say what everyone is thinking but wraped in a compliment to avoid getting banned. I myself was banned for saying the cancellation wasn't surprising as the show was so expensive to make and *not loved* by audiences. The rule I apparently violated was \"be honest\". At the insistence of a particularly silly Paramount PR person masquerading as an anonymous mod, I provided sources that the show was not universally loved- Metacritic, IMDB, Rotten Romatoes, Reddit itself, any number of sites, forums, and polls where its audience ratings are abysmal. I was told they don't accept audience opinions as sources on a statement about audience opinions.\n\nSo what? Well, the mod team is violating the Reddit moderation code by acting on unstated, unreasonable expectations, and stifling the community rather than facilitating it. More importantly, it's not appropriate for a corporate entity to manipulate the conversation around itself in a sub with half a million subscribers. It undermines the legitimacy and relevance of Reddit as a platform. I'm not sure what the solution is, but it's an ongoing problem that any anonymous person or group of people can take control of any subreddit they want. This specific case is a bit silly, but it's also how hate groups have been organized on Reddit, for example.\n\nI'm fine with a permanent ban there for breaking the silence. Who else has had this problem with startrek? Let me know in the comments!",

        "text": "Hello all, I recently found a summary of a story that I am trying to track down. The summary reads as follows: \n\n\"I  remember reading a science fiction short story in one of the major  sci/fi magazines of the time, about 50 years ago, that explored the very  same theme. The main character, a scientist, uses experimental  technology to keep his body and mind coherent as his atoms are separated  as he grows to virtually infinite size to find himself in a lab run by a  being resembling a mini tornado. As the scientist sees what appears to be a miniature universe in an  observation area, the Alien says how pleasant to have one of his  creations actually able to visit him. the Alien then says the experiment  is over and he was just about to destroy the universe experiment.  Despite the desperate pleas of the scientist, the Alien explains that  neither he (the scientist)  nor the universe are of any importance and  is about to press the destruct button when three new humanoid aliens pop  into existence and save the day by wrapping the universe in a purple  force field. The Tornado type is furious and threatens to smite them all  . Before he can act, however the new aliens hand the scientist a small  device, telling him he has only a few seconds to activate it and return  to earth, then they vanish, taking the now invulnerable universe with  them. At the time, this story caused a huge public outcry among  religious groups in the USA as it was seen as blasphemous and a  deliberate attack on God and their beliefs. The story ends with the  scientist accidentally finding himself on a desolate earth of the  future.\"\n\nThank you all for any assistance you may be able to provide.",

Clarke demonstrating how the ocean (any ocean) can be an invaluable resource:  \n\na. In “The Deep Range”, humans developed a plan to milk whales—yes, whales!—as a means of addressing food supplies while avoiding raising animals just to slaughter and eat them.  In other words, whales took the place of cows in providing milk to people, hence the word “range” in the title.  \n\nb. In his short story “The Man Who Ploughed the Sea”, Arthur C. Clarke described how many elements on the periodic table can be found in the ocean.  You just have to “comb through” a large enough volume of water.  \n\nc. In his novel “The Songs of Distant Earth”, the crew of the visiting space ship needed to “borrow” about one billion tons of water from Thalassa to construct a protective ice cone shield for their ship.  Fortunately, having only three islands, Thalassa could easily spare that much water.  Lol",

I believe my exact words were \"Dude, what's up with the trailer park elves?\" to which he told a nice story about reading in bed with his wife. She put down her book disgustedly and said something like \"Why do elves always have to be all ethereal and beautiful and graceful? Why can't they be, I don't know...rednecks?\". The lightbulb went off.\n\nI also, and I have NO proof of this, suggested that since he sells a lot of MHI swag, that he make Cabbage Point Killing Machine concert T-shirts. They showed up on his merch site not too long after.\n\nI friend requested John Ringo and included the message that I had just been standing in line at the grocery store trying to calculate the street value of the bottle of maple syrup the woman in front of me was buying. IYKYK. He LOL'd and accepted\n\nI asked on David Weber's website a question regarding his Hell's Gate series (which I REALLY hope isn't dead) about where people would choose to place a colony on an unpopulated alternate Earth, knowing what we know about OUR Earth and he responded. Near the site of St. Louis was his answer, due to a lot of different factors that he took the time to list.\n\nAnyone have any stories?",

Could be mech suits, ships, monster shell bodies, VR avatars etc. as well. I'm interested in any medium - books, comics, film, games. Bonus points for mental health / trauma recovery parallels. The ending of the Neon Genesis Evangelion film is a nice example of what I'm looking for, but I'd like more focus on the sensory distortion aspects of the suit/mech (seeing the world as enemies to be killed), and on the aftermath of healing. \n\nAny recs? :)",
