Even MacReady's first name was ambiguously given as 'R.J.' and it always left me wondering what exactly those initials meant.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the daughte's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike EEAAO truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in evelyn's existential catchphrase \"Hot Dog Hands,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as this genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂",

Might see it as super shallow and just a shill for Apple. Which I guess it is...\n\nI'm not even saying it deserved it over the others!\n\nI just think it would be a shame if people either missed the point of it or didnt watch it at all because of the reception on this platform when clearly it has helped alot of people through dark and difficult times...",

        "text": "Here are the reasons why it was historical:\n\n(1) the first Asian woman - Michelle Yeoh - to win Best Actress, \n\n(2) the first time in history that two Asian actors - Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh - won Oscars in the same night, \n\n(3) only the second and third Southeast Asian actors in history - Quan is Vietnamese and Yeoh is Malaysian - to win Oscars. The first was (Cambodian) Haing S. Ngor, supporting actor in “The Killing Fields” in 1985.\n\n(4) only the third time in Oscar history that three actors (Quan, Yeoh, and Jamie Lee Curtis) from the same film won Oscars. The other two films were “A Streetcar Named Desire” - Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden - in 1952, and “Network” - Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, and Beatrice Straight - in 1977, \n\n(5) only the second time in Oscar history that two actresses older than 60 won in the same night (Curtis is 64 and Yeoh is 61). The first time was in 2021 when Youn Yuh-Jung (73) and Frances McDormand (63) won for “Minari” and “Nomadland,” respectively,\n\n(6) With an average age of 57.68 years, tonight’s group of winning actors is the third oldest in history. The oldest was in 1982 (71.62 with Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn, John Gielgud, and Maureen Stapleton) and the second oldest was in 2021 (63.29 with Anthony Hopkins, Frances McDormand, Daniel Kaluuya, and Youn Yuh-Jung),\n\n(7) Daniel Kwan is only the third person of Asian descent to be named Best Director. The other two were Ang Lee (who won twice for “Life of Pi” and “Brokeback Mountain”) and Chloé Zhao (for “Nomadland”).\n\n(8) and, finally (for those of you who are unaware), there’s something called The Big Five of the Oscars: Picture, Director, Best Actor/Actress, and Screenplay. Only three films have achieved that feat: in 1935, “It Happened One Night”; in 1976, “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest”; and, in 1992, “The Silence of the Lambs.” \n\nTonight’s Best Picture winner did one better: “Everything, Everywhere, All At Once” not only picked up Best Picture but also Director, (Original) Screenplay, and *three* acting awards which has never been achieved by any other film in Oscar history. Its seven awards make it the most recognized Best Picture since “Slumdog Millionaire” in 2009.\n\nAnd, since we’re talking about women, the Adapted Screenplay Oscar went to a woman - Sarah Polley, a Canadian actress, writer, and director - for a film about women - “Women Talking.” \n\nHollywood has a history of neglecting female actors (especially of “a certain age”) and actors of Asian descent (of all ages). The 2021 Oscars started a trend in the right direction for both groups and tonight continued that trend.\n\nYeoh said it best: “Ladies, don’t let anyone tell you [that] you’re past your prime!”",

THE FUCK???? very clearly the water sprayer has clear implicit subconcious implications as a phallic freudian symbol which ejaculates (sprays)\n3. she has to drink up milk, a white symbol with overt sexual and freudian themes whether that be through lactation which is only achievable in a woman after sexual maturity (therefore identifying portmans as a mature woman) or as the more sttaightforward symbol of semen.

Taking on the system.  Risking his life and making a difference in the world.\n\nTop Gun is a  film where war is fun. And there is no chance for anything ever to go wrong for Maverick. He can steal and wreck it a billion dollar aircraft and nothing happens. A movie that is so stupid that they will fire  40 to 50 tomahawk missiles to destroy a Runway yet not do anything about the missile batteries.",

I don't have any issue with who wins what, but I do wonder and would like to hear what fellow film lovers think - is this the last great turn for arguably modern cinema's most important mainstream filmmaker? \n\nHe hasn't indicated a wish to retire, although it was reported that he would direct a Bullitt reboot (which he strangely did not mention in a recent presser in Berlin). But Fabelmans does feel like the kind of big final act for Spielberg the director, as he looks back at his career and passion. \n\nI love Spielberg. Not just his films, but also for who he is and what he's done for Hollywood blockbusters. If he indeed retired or dialed down, it'd have been great for him to go on stage one last time as a best director... not that he needs the trophy of course.",

I hope this gets ameliorated because it would be great to turn to it for verification about certain films. I can't remember exact details but one time it told me a character died during a movie when they didnt... was very bizarre\n\nI think it also told me that **spoilers for fault in our stars** hazel grace dies if cancer at the end of the movie and im like, did i miss that? I mean you could argue its an off-screen death thats inevitable but then you might as well say every character in every movie dies off screen given enough time.",
