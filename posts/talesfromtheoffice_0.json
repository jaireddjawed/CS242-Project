I've seen two different projects get caught up over tiny, tiny expenses.  \n\nMonths ago, I was working on one where someone complained that I wasn't ordering a certain piece of equipment for a job we have.  It's $400k for this equipment and no one could decide where it needed to be.  We needed two things in two of three places, but no one could tell me which two of the three it would be, so I refused to order it.  Someone ordered it anyway.  One of the items ended up in the correct place, but the other one did not, so there was a new shipping fee.  I couldn't get approval for a shipping expense (less than $100) to ship this $200k piece of gear from the wrong place to the right place.  As far as I know, it's still there.  \n\nThis is pretty standard, though.  It's also very frustrating.  \n",

        "text": "We have a guy in our office (not my dept but across the aisle from my cube) that is becoming a bigger and bigger abuser of Working From Home.  His manager works in another state, so all dept meetings are online (so this guy can call in from anywhere).  He has a self-imposed WFH day each week that started out as every Friday, but lately has morphed to coincide with PTO days.\n\nCase in point, he took PTO on June 29 (Friday), so he adjusted his WFH day to the 28th (Thursday).  He was on PTO for about a week, coming back to work on 7/5.  Instead of coming in to work on 7/5 and 7/6, though, he said he developed a bad cold while on PTO and would be WFH those two days.  He didn't even bother to say something like, \"I'll WFH today but try to come in tomorrow if I'm feeling better.\" I guess he just knew he wouldn't be feeling better the next day?  ;)\n\nThis week, he's come in every day, but left early saying he hasn't been feeling well.  He looked and sounded fine to me. ;)\n\nToday, on his white board, he posted 7/12 - WFH Afternoon and 7/13 - PTO.\n\nI happen to know that his department doesn't have an official WFH policy, but it's generally known that you should only be WFH if you're contagious and/or physically unable to come in (flu/recent operation/etc.).\n\nWhy does this bother me so much, and how do I get eyes on it to have it stopped?  It's just so brazen and blatant.  He's taking advantage of WFH and he'll probably ruin it for the rest of us down the road.  Obviously his manager is clueless since he works in another state, and I don't want to single anyone out and be known as a rat.\n\nAny suggestions on what I can or should do?  (I've actually considered calling in to the anonymous ethics line we have here at work, though I'm not sure what I'd say.)",

        "text": "I \"work\" for a volunteer organisation doing data entry.\n\nI unintentionally ended up the manager for this data entry job, so set about \"hiring\" people to help, as the workload was getting too big for one person.\n\nIt is mainly based in spreadsheets, and due to no one being overly technical in this area, it was quite a janky system with no backups. Can't be helped, you can only do what you can do in a volunteer situation.\n\nI got a few team members coming and going, only a few issues. But nothing of note until this one guy. He put his hand up to help and I gladly welcomed him in and trained him. We usually do the data entry in our own homes on a collective spreadsheet, but I do in person training where needed. It's not very hard and there are also picture instructions.\n\nThe first week they were supposed to start entering data, nothing happened. I asked what was up, and they asked to have another training session as they were totally confused. I agreed and booked another session with them. In the meantime, I had to enter all their data, only to find they had written all over spreadsheets not related, and also the only one I had told them to not touch. There were formulas on that one, connected to other sheets to make collation of data easier to see. I realised that something could go horribly wrong if I didn't take steps, and locked down that sheet so no one could input data into it but me, and fixed all the formulas. The other sheets had similar columns, so I innocently thought that was the mixup. I also locked down every other document so only a few people were able to use them. Never needed to do this before.\n\nTraining day came and notes were taken this time, but by a friend that had come along with them. I thought this was a good sign, they're really trying here. I reiterated 3 more times, not to touch this specific sheet, and re-explained why.\n\nThe next week, I set them off to start entering data and they said they had done some of it. Then disappeared. I messaged them letting them know that it has to be done by a set time (There was a due date each week for the data), and I was going to have to do his if he didn't have it done in time. \n\nThey came back briefly and told me they were doing it now. There was silence for a bit then he told me he wasn't able to enter any data into the sheet! I asked, are you on the sheet I told you not to use? \n\nNo.\n\nI thought that sounded odd, but let it go as there was silence for a bit longer. \n\nThen I saw a strange number I had never seen show up on the \"Do not touch\" sheet. After some poking around, I realised that because the guy wasn't able to actually enter any data on the sheet, he had resorted to putting comments on it with all the data in the comments.\n\nThis time I asked, are you putting comments on the sheet I said not to touch?\n\nHe said, yes, it won't let me put the data in otherwise.\n\nI said again. Don't.Touch.That.Sheet! And sent a picture with an arrow pointing directly at the sheet he was supposed to be using (Which he had been shown 5 times at this point.) I became increasingly worried that if I let this guy keep 'helping', then everything would be scrumpled and thrown into the great fiery hell of nothingness.\n\nSo after 3 hours of actual data entry, I had to let them go. \n\nI spent the next few hours finding random bits of data that I wasn't aware of, being sprinkled in some of the weirdest places. So glad I locked it down after I thought something was going awry!",

Usually after a couple days they just throw you in, thus our 30-60 day turnover is very high.\n\n\nI have a new coworker that is supposed to be working closely with me, and started this week. I didn't really see her the first 2 days, so I assumed she was in training, since the Management has been talking up their \"New Training Process\". Then, 3 days ago, I'm told she's shadowing me. \n\n\nThis makes sense, she is going to be working with me. But, for reference, I am barely a half-step above the bottom rung in this company, I do not have control or am really in charge of anything, nor do I have any training on how to train others.\n\n\nAt first, I thought she was a bit slow, but most of us came into our industry with little to no experience, the first week can be overwhelming. Then I realize that her first two days of \"training\" were just shadowing someone half a step above me (also has not training on how to train others). In my mind, she didin't really take it to heart that that was supposed to be her training, and was still waiting for the \"real training\" to start. But this means nothing I have said to her the first day had proper context, and was basically useless.\n\n\nDay 2, I'm told she's sitting with me, and I try to have do some practice on my computer, get her used to the system, try to explain why we work things the way we are to give her context and get it to stick. I leave the office confident she can handle working under my guidance today (I was told she was still going to be sitting with me)\n\n\nToday I realized this person is either computer illiterate, suffering from short term memory loss, or just dumb. Everything I showed her or guided her through, she asked me about within 5 minutes. Every time she had to go through our main processes she needed me to hold her hand through every step, every word she typed I needed to feed her.\n\n\nAnd even with me spoon feeding her words, as patiently and calmly as I could, she would get flustered and only catch half of what I was saying. Not a direct half, but every other word I would say. And then she would change them when she typed it out. I would say, \"Type in this box that you called (person) and they said (what they told her)\" and she would type \"(Person) told me to (something completely different from what she was told IN THE CONVERSATION THAT SHE HAD!) and I would have to gently correct her before she saved in our system. She would also close out of things while I was explaining what she needed to do, and not realize that she even did it.\n\n\nBut the biggest this that bothers me is that I really think she could be an ok worker is she got the right training and guidance, but that is just not my role. I am not equipped or trained on bringing an experience-less person into the industry. But instead she was \"shadowing\" for a week and is going to be expected to work on her own on Monday (under my guidance, RIP my production numbers). We'll see how it goes...",

        "text": "My company has been pretty crappy on taking care of its employees.  A little over a year ago, they told us that if we hit a certain goal, we’d be in for bonuses and raises.  Then, when it came time to pay up, they had moved the goal-posts and listed some other objectives they’d never shared with any of us, including some that were out of our control.  Then, they did some layoffs and put people on furloughs (unpaid).  \n\nThis pissed a lot of people off, so in the next “all-hands” meeting, they had a Q&amp;A session where they allowed people to vocalize their complaints/requests for improvement as well as email or IM anything you wanted to talk about.  Throughout this meeting, people were saying things like, “You could let me work from home more often,” or “Give us room for advancement.”  \n\nOne guy complained that he had been forced to take all of his vacation at the end of the year (in December) when he had been saving it for a family event in January.  He’d tried to get an exception to the rule forcing you to use it all up, but the company refused to let him do this, so he had to put in a request for unpaid vacation, which almost didn’t get approved because there was a lot of work to catch up on after forcing people out of the office in December.  \n\nSo, a few weeks later, we start getting these emails about surveys to take and asking for inputs on the work environment.  I worked in a customer location, which was pretty crappy at times.  With it being a customer location, there was little room for complaint, but they treated us like you’d think a customer would treat it supplier.  The one that made me laugh was when they put up signs saying they were replacing the carpet in one area.  Two of the ladies who worked there were all happy about getting “new carpet.”  It turned out that they replaced it with carpet that was in worse shape than the carpet they took out.  \n\nAfter all these surveys were gathered, we started getting emails saying, “We listened!” and “Positive changes are coming!”  I was skeptical and I was right to question the validity of these changes.  \n\nWe had another all-hands meeting and it was announced that the top two requests that showed up in the surveys were:  1) flexible work hours and 2) additional time off without pay.  When this was announced, they said that people would be allowed to take of as much time (without pay) as they requested (subject to the manager’s approval) and anyone who wanted to cut back his hours from 40 to fewer than 40 hours could do so, but with an equal reduction to pay and benefits.  \n\nThis was met with a lot of puzzled looks and moans and groans.  The guy who had been forced to take time off without pay asked if anyone in the room (about 40 of us) had put either of these on their survey.  No one responded.  Then, he asked if anyone had said they’d like a raise, a bonus, or vacations on their own schedule.  Just about everyone raised their hands.  \n\nWhen our office’s account manager started talking about the new “benefits” again, he mentioned that people wanted more flexible remote working conditions and proudly announced that anyone who lived within 50 miles of an office location was now required to report to that office for all work-related activities.  This meant that a lot of people who had been working remotely in the past were now required to work in an office when they had been working from home.  \n\nIn the end, this guy recaps the new “benefits,” which were, “You can now take as much time off without pay as you want (with approval from your supervisor).  You can reduce your hours any time you want (with a matching decrease in pay and benefits).  You no longer have to work from home!  That’s right.  You spoke.  We listened.”  \n\ntl;dr:  company didn't listen at all, makes it possible for people to work less and take a pay cut, plus have to report to the office every day.  No benefit, but pat themselves on the back anyway.  ",

        "text": "So I work at a substance abuse treatment center and I do all of the admissions for clients with health insurance (which involves a detailed assessment and then calling their insurance to get authorization for treatment, which isn't necessarily a given and could be denied for stupid reasons). My normal admissions coordinator person is on maternity leave. She is great, I love her, I definitely miss her! So instead, I have the associate CEO (let's call him ACEO) taking calls and scheduling admissions.\n\nJust some background about ACEO. He was brought in from outside the company, but I get the feeling that the CEO quickly realized that ACEO isn't CEO material. Instead of learning CEO stuff, he now does facility management stuff (like calling whoever you call when pipes freeze and burst, or calling the laundry machine company when the machines break) and helps with fundraising. Sometimes (although he tries very, very hard to get out of it), he helps me with admissions. Now that the regular admissions coordinator is gone, he does parts of her job too.\n\nSo the thing that I liked about the regular admissions coordinator was that I always knew what was going on, in terms of how many clients were coming in for admission, when they were coming, and their information (name, insurance, etc). But not with ACEO. This morning, I literally had this conversation with him (after coming back from 2 weeks vacation today):\n\n\nMe: So any admissions coming today?\n\nACEO: There are definitely 2 males this afternoon, but I'm not sure otherwise.\n\nMe: You aren't sure?\n\nACEO: Yeah, I am pretty sure I scheduled a female for sometime this week, but I can't remember when or what her name is.\n\nMe: ????\n\nACEO: It will be okay, we'll figure it out.\n\nMe: ???\n\n\nTo be fair, I tend to freak out about stuff and get stressed out easily. But seriously? You scheduled someone but you don't know who or when?? And as it turns out, that mystery female was actually two females that were scheduled to come in this morning at 9am. Nice job, ACEO. Since he didn't tell anyone that they were coming (including himself, lol), he actually had to do one of the assessments because there was no one else available last minute. See, the reason we don't overbook and we schedule ahead of time is so we can plan for how much help I will need! Imagine that!\n\nSo we all survived the day. At the end of the day, ACEO calls me to tell me about the schedule for tomorrow. If you think that he learned from his mistake of this morning, you would be wrong. \n\n\nMe: So any admissions tomorrow morning?\n\nACEO: I scheduled a male for 9am. What was his name? I think it was Italian-sounding... Maybe it started with an S?\n\nMe:???\n\nMe: *goes through every S last name from the last month with him* \n\nACEO: I'll call upstairs and see if they know. I'll call you back.\n\n\nSpoiled alert! He didn't tell them either! How did this happen again?? How hard is it to send an email after you schedule someone, alerting everyone that they're coming and including their info? We finally figured it out, when I looked even further back, but geez! I will admit to being a little mean to him about it, but in my defense, what the heck? I can't wait for my regular admissions coordinator to get back...",

        "text": "So I just had this exchange, and I was just astounded. \n\n$Me is me, $CW is coworker. \n\nBackground- I have an occasional task that involves setting up a bunch of laptops and their associated wireless access point. Maybe once a month or so. I was doing this today and encountered a big issue. I've encountered little problems before, they've been easy to fix. This was bigger, and I asked around before escalating to $CW. Also noteworthy is that the only documentation on this process is a schedule of whose turn it is to do it, and a checklist of what needs to work on the computers. No instructions, step by step processes, nothing else. \n\nFinally, I give up and go to $CW, the person responsible for the laptops. \n\n$me- hey $CW, the laptops are having a big problem with X. Is this a known issue or do you have any strategies to fix it before I escalate to IT? \n\n$CW- Lets take a look. \n\n(We walk to the laptops)\n\n$me- I've tried X, Y, Z. I was able to get a few working by doing [Other thing]\n\n$CW- (sounding somewhat patronizing) well who taught you how to do [Other thing]?\n\n$me- nobody. But there's no instructions on how to handle this type of situation. \n\n$CW- yeah no that's bad. Don't do that, you need to check [Other logical fix]. ($CW started checking out the computers directly at this point) You shouldn't have done that, why did you do that? \n\n$me- there's no instructions so I'm troubleshooting as best as I know how.\n\n$CW- (taking over and leaving me standing around) I'll schedule you to do the next few of these with me. \n\n$me- well, I have some time, why don't I document the known problems and fixes? I can get them down in a document and people won't have to bother you when this happens. \n\n$CW- No! We're way to busy with all these other things, we don't have time! (Keeps working on the computers, leaves me just standing around)... yeah you can go, I'll finish this. \n\nSo now I'm basically told I'm too stupid to update these computers, and it's a waste to document these issues. Instead, let's make $CW take 2 days to do this instead of their regular job, only to let other, supposedly more pressing things go. Meanwhile I'm sitting here with my thumb up my ass, trying to make it easier in the future, and you flat out refuse. To me that says \"I don't want you to take away my control over this process, so I need to control all the information. \n\nI ended up leaving for lunch at that point because it just makes no sense and I'm angry for feeling patronized and having my hand slapped over making the situation better long-term.

        "text": "Today is the last day of this terrible account manager at my work.  I’ve told stories about him on here before.  This is a guy I call “Grumpy.”  He caused so many issues that he then tried to stick on others, I’m surprised he wasn’t let go before now, but when his boss was fired, it left him exposed with no top cover, so he had no other choice but to resign.  \n\nJust before this guy submitted his resignation, another co-worker, a guy that had also been shat upon by Grumpy had submitted his resignation.  This guy (I’ll call him Toby) was a decent, hard-working guy.  When he had more work than he could handle, Grumpy said, “I’m going to get you some help.”  Grumpy then hired one of his old chums and put that person over Toby, so now, Toby had one additional boss and no additional help.  \n\nWhen Toby submitted his resignation, he let everyone in the office know via email.  Toby got dozens of responses that were “reply all,” so everyone could see what nice things people had to say about Toby.  Someone also set up an office lunch for a going-away for Toby and lots of people confirmed they were going.  \n\nGrumpy then sends his resignation to the whole office.  Nothing but crickets in response.  Not one person did a reply all to Grumpy.  One of Grumpy’s cronies sent a notice about an office lunch for Grumpy’s departure.  A few people confirmed, but not very many.   \n\nA few days after this, another guy, I’ll call him Rowdy, he sends his letter of resignation and an email to the office with the same results as Toby (people responding).  Another message goes out that there will be dinner for Rowdy a few days after Grumpy’s lunch.  Lots of people confirm that they’re going.\n\nGrumpy then cancels his lunch and says he’ll tag on with Rowdy’s dinner and it will be a going-away for the two of them.  I had been going to Rowdy’s dinner, but when I saw Grumpy was attached, I backed out.  \n\nThe day of the Grumpy/Rowdy dinner, Rowdy tells the office he can’t make it to his own dinner due to a family emergency.  Someone offers to reschedule it, but Rowdy can’t commit to a new date, so the coordinator (one of Grumpy’s cronies) says he’ll have it anyway with just Grumpy.  As soon as the news gets out, just about everyone cancels.  \n\nThis made me laugh.  Grumpy thought of himself as this first-rate manager that everyone looked up to and loved, but in reality, no one could or can stand him (except the specific people he brought on board).  \n\nAbout an hour ago, Grumpy sent out an email talking about how his successes were only possible because of the great leadership of the team (meaning himself) and that he works with some truly amazing people (his bosses).  It’s a classic.  There will be no love lost and I wonder what will happen to the unskilled cronies he’s leaving behind without him there to prop them up.  \n",

It was amusing at first, but it got distracting very quickly. \n\nBeing the last day before Christmas break, there's nothing much to do, so he's extremely bored. After the third time of singing Never Going to Give You Up while hitting his desk, I put on my earphones. He looked a bit annoyed and walked off to talk to his friends. I feel kind of bad because he's always been nice to me, but being rickrolled three times in a row is too much. I don't think he is trying to annoy anyone specifically, he probably just lacks self-awareness.",

I was one of the main ones he criticized at all time.  I was glad to leave the account.  \n\nHe always talked about \"transparency\" with the customer and \"unity\" and all these buzz words he liked to throw around, but if you put them into practice, he would be pissed, mostly because he was typically doing the opposite of what he said he was doing at the company's expense and at the customer's expense.  \n\nFor months, Grumpy was trying to get the customer to approve this one part of the project, claiming that not approving it was costing him lots of money.  He would go into meetings and would get all fired up about how many dollars it was costing him/the company.  So, it came to bite him in the ass when the customer finally approved this part of the project and said, \"Do it!\"  Well, he'd been lying about having the equipment in the warehouse, so in the spirit of that \"transparency,\" one of our managers told the customer, \"We don't have the equipment and it will take us six months to get it.\"  \n\nGrumpy was livid, asking why this guy told the customer that, but it was too late.  Grumpy had no way of getting out of this.  Also, his boss was mysteriously fired, so he had no top cover to bail him out, so he ended up resigning.  I don't think it could have happened to a shittier person.  This guy sent out a resignation notice that sounded like he was abdicating the throne or something.  \n\nWhen my boss told our team about this guy leaving and the \"void in leadership\" it would create, I told him that having no one at the helm was still better than having that jackass there.  It's amazing what someone can get away with in a big company.  ",

I had been trying to get a 1-on-1 meeting with my supervisor about the whole incident, basically because I refused to work with someone as unprofessional as this person. She never responded to my requests though and only acknowledged the incident verbally, once since it happened.\n\nAn old coworker who moved teams texted me one Sunday night, as apparently they were wondering why I removed that person from Facebook. I simply told them I removed people I didn't talk to on there, which was actually true. The fact that it took them that long to notice that I had removed them is hilarious to me. I saw them later in the office that week and they said nothing about it, which shows that they were too cowardly to even confront me about it.\n\nI can now officially say this person is no longer with my job and I could not be happier about it. They've been gone for three weeks, which I heard was for some type of medical leave. But we'd only hear that they were gone each week, not that she'd be out for a long period of time. I'm guessing they were on some type of probation before they could let them go (I haven't heard if she was fired or if something else happened, I wish I knew more details).\n\nWith them already being gone for three weeks, our short-staffed team has adjusted to the workflow and we're working on getting a replacement for someone else who recently left. Things will still be busy for awhile but in the long run it will be better for the team to not have a Debbie Downer who can't work on their own.",

On Friday, I'm ready to fly back.  The guy running the account says, \"Hey, you want this guy out here next week?  Okay, he'll be here next week.\"  \n\nI put in for my travel that same day, but it doesn't get approved (of course).  All weekend, I'm bugging the guy, but Monday rolls around and it's still not approved.  The guy running the account says, \"Just get on a plane and get out here.\"  He finds me a flight that leaves at 10:30 p.m. and arrives there at something like 6:30 a.m.  He tells me I can sleep on the flight and just roll into the office.  \n\nYeah, sure.  I tell him I'm not flying without approval.  He says get out there, he'll get the approval.  \n\nThe next day, my travel does get approved.

Company policy says you're supposed to get approval two weeks in advance of travel.  And, this is a company that is looking to save every penny, so they screw people over on purpose sometimes.  I'm just thinking how crappy it is that people are so short-sighted that they expect you to just jump through hoops to do whatever it takes, but when you need them, they're nowhere to be found.  \n",

We're a very small office with 6 employees, comprising the owner and the office manager underneath him, then the remaining 4 of us (3 agents, plus myself, the customer service rep). Nearly everyone at the office has been there more than 5 years with the exception of myself (6 months for me) and the newest office manager. We'll call her Liz. Liz is replacing our previous office manager who just recently retired, Helen, who had been with the company for 15 years and is an elderly woman. Helen was just a beautiful person and she really didn't even seem like an office manager. I liked her better than the owner. Anyway, the crazy thing about Liz is that she doesn't live here. She's apparently a friend of the owner's cousin or something so she somehow scored a great deal of working from home several states north of us, \"managing\" the office. She has never even set foot in our state. She interviewed for the position over Skype. She's patched in to all the computer programs we use and has her own phone extension so to customers it's like she's in the office with the rest of us, but to actual office staff it's pretty damn weird.\n\nLiz has only worked here for two weeks and has been a grade A pain in my rear the entire time. Because she works from home, we have to hope that she's responsible enough to be at work during normal hours, and taking her lunch and stuff at appropriate times. Instead, she appears to be absent during large stretches of the day. I'll call her extension and 90% of the time will get no answer. I'll email her and she'll take several hours to reply. When she does communicate with us, it's all rude and curt and like she doesn't care about any of us or doing her job correctly. For example, this is the first email she sent to all of the staff on her very first day (paraphrased):\n\n\"Good day everyone. My name is LIZ B. SAPPHIRE and I am PROUD to be the new manager here at Independent Insurance. I just want to make a few things clear to my staff: first, I get along easily with everyone but you DO NOT want to get on my bad side. I am more than happy to alert FRANCIS [the owner] of any PROBLEM PEOPLE who prevent this office from being SUCCESSFUL. At the same time, if there is anything I can be of assistance with, please DON'T HESITATE to contact me! I may not be in the office with you guys but I promise I am 'one of you.' Thank you for your cooperation and let's have a great partnership! Sincerely yours, Liz.\"\n\nAnd yes, she did sprinkle those random caps throughout the email. She does this in every email she sends. I have only managed to speak to her on the phone once in her two weeks here, to ask her if she was handling a particular customer, and she rushed me off the phone and sounded annoyed that I asked her to help me with something. I've told the owner about all of this and forwarded every email to him. He seems to think she just \"needs time\" to get comfortable in her position and learn our \"office culture.\" How can she learn our culture if she is trying her hardest to be a B-word?? How can she get comfortable if she doesn't work in the office with us? I don't understand how I'm even supposed to take someone who works four states away seriously. I think the owner just ignores all of this because his cousin recommended her. You know how that goes. It's not what you know, but who you know.",

I also regret not saying how uncomfortable I was in the moment. I told my boss about the exchange today and she had no idea that this was coming. I said that I'm worried about retaliation if it's found out I shared this information. But she said she will go to the next level of management to report what I told her and her boss would get in trouble if he retaliated against me. I initially felt better after telling her. Everything will be out in the open. But my husband thinks my boss is betraying me and questions whether I could actually be protected in the future. Now I'm obsessing over the situation.

        "text": "I work in IT at a private university, which means a lot of people are entitled and this especially means executives. Even if they are the people with answers, they don't like to be bothered by us common IT folk (until they have a problem, of course).\n\nA couple years ago I had a ticket to work with someone who was moving positions from one campus to another. Stuff like this is normally simple, pull the old computer, get it set up for their replacement, and get said person set up in their new position. Somehow this person's hard drive got tied up in a legal hold, which held my ticket and ability to access data he apparently needed because he was still working for the same person.\n\nIn this ordeal, too many people got involved. My supervisor, my coworker who was dealing with the legal hold, me who had the ticket, and the executive over in the President's office who dealt with legal holds. I couldn't find my supervisor and coworker who might know more about it, so I decided to try calling Executive, as I've worked with her before and she's easygoing most of the time. She doesn't answer, but calls me back while I'm out for lunch, then I call her back after lunch and she doesn't answer.\n\nThat afternoon, my supervisor tells me: \"Don't play phone tag with executives.\" And leaves it at that, despite me explaining my reasoning for calling her. I decide to also leave it at that, and wait for her to come to me after the legal hold was resolved, even if it means the ticket stays open for months.\n\nToday, I was responding to an email thread to select a different vendor for our e-Recycle program in order to try and save money. This thread has been ongoing for months because nobody wants to sit down and have a meeting with a vendor, they just want to keep talking about how our current vendor is too expensive and that we need to figure out a different vendor.\n\nThe last email was from our CIO's assistant who copied our CIO, and two Senior Directors from Finance because it involved making the decision of an \"approved vendor.\" We were waiting on a response from one of the directors who never did respond (and has a habit of replying to one person rather than hitting Reply All). Today I figured out that our Faclities department has a contract with a separate vendor who will also do IT recycling, and that there's no reason not to start moving forward with them once we sit down and meet. I sent this information in an email to update everyone.\n\nLater, my director emailed me asking me not to do that in the future, because \"Executives prefer a chain of command\" and requests sound better coming from him or my supervisor. Okay, whatever. They have the information needed to make a decision, I'm not going to make anymore movement on it. I know this is going to result in our equipment getting piled up and nothing getting done about it until we waste more money with our current vendor again because \"the equipment's gotta go now.\"\n\nI realize that just about every work place has executives and bosses that are like this, and that this isn't exclusive to where I work or even in my field. I just needed to vent.",

But there were a handful of issues for which I hadn't been copied on the replies, so I had to follow up on those. I set a couple aside because the coworker that should have handled them was off today.\n\nThen one of my least favorite employees comes to me complaining thather software is freaking out. What is it doing? Just freaking out. Is there an error message? Something about the beginning date of a contract. Of course she's checked the dates she's entering. So I walk over to her desk and watch her enter a beginning date that occurs after the end date. I told her that's the problem, just like the error dialog was trying to, and walk away.  \n\nI help a new employee with something she's never done before. Use the total of these GL accounts to complete your calculation. She seems to get it and takes a lot of notes. I found that encouraging. I was wrong. She had left one account out and her calculations were way off, but she did ask me to check her work before finalizing it. That's encouraging, right?\n\nI help another employee with the same task. She's been there longer than I have. I no longer feel encouraged.  \n\nI go through my mailbox - another hour of divvying up things that aren't mine - and come across an overdraft notice from one of our banks.  \n\nThey've paid two checks and now one of our accounts is in the negative. I check our system and don't see anything out of the ordinary, nothing to indicate that the account could have been overdrawn. So I log in to the bank's portal and pull the account history. The check numbers jump from somewhere in to 5000s to somewhere in the 6000s. I laugh maniacally as I sink lower and lower into my desk chair...  \n\nThe bank has honored eight fraudulent checks, overdrawing the account. The check numbers are out of sequence. The signatures don't belong to either of the signers on the account. Five of them are all made out for the same amount to the same person on the same date. I grab the business card of the bank VP, which is conveniently clipped to my file from the LAST TIME THEY ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN and I call him. He sounds sad. I contemplate burning everything to the ground.  \n\nTLDR: Everything is awful and I have to go back tomorrow. Sigh.",

        "text": "I've seen my fair share of office drama in the number of years I've worked in an office. But this is the first time I've had it happen to me. A coworker pulled me aside recently and told me that someone in our IT office was complaining about my Facebook posts. She couldn't say who or what post, just to be mindful of what I post.\n\nOkay, sure. I go check my Facebook and look at what I've posted recently and nothing that I would deem offensive. I forget about it after that. Where I work is not the type of place to fire you over a Facebook post. Even if the the post slanders the company, even if it was made during company hours (neither of which the post in question is), your chances of being fired over that are very slim. Most people would get a slap on the wrist in this case. I also go over who from IT I have on my list, and the few people I have on are not the type to be easily offended or care about what I post, although I remove one person who could potentially be an offender, who also rarely posts and I never talk to on there, only at work. Everybody on my Facebook from work I actually talk to outside of work.\n\nAbout a week later I get a call from my coworker after she's off the clock and outside of the office. She asks me if I found and deleted said post. I explained that I looked and couldn't find anything. The closest thing I ever post that's offensive is some political posts, but those have not been for awhile. At this point I post something maybe once a week on average. She suggests deleting anything that could be even close to offensive or even political. She then tells me that said person went to HR over the post because it was \"offensive to women\" and that it was the only female coworker on my team besides my boss. I start freaking out and go over the posts again, and find what it [probably was](https://www.facebook.com/Exposingmensrightsactivism/photos/a.1433871936899711.1073741828.1433786246908280/1957610894525810/?type=3&amp;theater). I check the settings and change it to friends, then remove said person after figuring out from context clues (my coworker could not say her name but it's implied that I know). If she asks, I have an alibi as I forgot she was on my page because we don't talk on there anyway. I would just tell her that I cleaned my list off of people I don't talk to, which was true anyway.\n\nSo far, this is pretty much where I'm at with it. It's been a week since I was told the HR thing, but the post was at least a month ago. My boss is trying to avoid an HR meeting or getting it out in the open, so I told my coworker that I refuse to work with her directly due to unprofessionalism. Coworker will talk to my boss about the best way to handle this moving forward, but I'm still waiting for that conversation.\n\nKeep in mind that this woman who reported me is not liked by most people in the office. She whines and complains a lot. She's always asking for help with basic tasks despite having been here over a year, and having previously worked with us as a contractor. She's so used to how fast everything moves in the corporate world, if something isn't working for her in a university environment, it's like her brain just shuts off. I've always been the one whose had the most patience with her; I will sit down with her and show her things to try to make her be more independent, but also stay there and make sure my suggestions worked. I've always been the nicest to her out of all of my team including our boss, and the fact that she reported me over something petty without even talking to me is a stab in the back.\n\nWhile most people want her gone, there are no grounds to fire her on as of right now. She gets away with doing simple tasks that is our team's responsibility. Because she can get these done fairly quickly, she completes multiple a day and it makes her numbers look good, but no manager is actually looking at the quality of work. We're also short-staffed right now and aren't in a position to let anyone go until things slow down so that the easy tasks can go to someone else.",

But problem is boss exhibits almost like a low reading comprehension ability which makes it almost impossible to solve complex problems with variable elements and roleplayers via email. And face-to-face or phone discussions are counterproductive despite my preference for them to clear the air and make decisions, set priorities.\n\nThis job market is a seller's market and has been for decades.

OM was a great guy and a good manager, he was too nice and often let people walk over him/take advantage of his kindness. He was salaried, so if a project needed to get done, he'd come in over the weekend and not expect pay for it because getting overtime approved here is a tedious process. AD had promoted him from technician to manager, but slowly started to dislike his managerial style and it seemed like AD &amp; Director had it out for him. They talked about how he \"abused sick day privileges\" by using sick days to go to a chiropractor if his back hurt too bad that day. Or if stayed late one day, he might come in late the next day if he needed to do something such as making sure his kids got to the bus on time.\n\nHe became more cynical at this job and it started to show. Eventually, certain people on our team were promoted and he was out of the loop until it was announced at a meeting. He went to AD about if he was still a manager, and her response was essentially, \"Well we don't really need an Operations Manager and we never officially changed your job title or pay.\" He knew all of this in the few years he was deemed a manager, so he was essentially taking on extra responsibilities without the pay (I wouldn't have stood for that). No more for him.\n\nEventually, he started to look at other opportunities and applied for a position for another IT team at the same workplace. When he got the job, he didn't tell our managers he was planning to switch over at the end of the year. It wasn't until his new director talked to AD that she found out, and chewed him out for not talking to her about it. He basically cited past bad experiences and being \"demoted\" without officially being told until he asked, so he saw no reason to officially tell them of his new job.",

        "text": "Where I work, I get asked to make a lot of updates on the reports done by others.  One thing we’ve had an issue with is when people revise delivery dates without getting approval.  Another issue we’ve had is conflicting information from different sources.  To combat these issues, we’ve gone through a lot of process improvements, which have included things like sending an email to the person whose approval is needed and not making a change until it’s approved.  Another was making one document a “single source of truth.”  That document is used to update the other documents so they all say the same thing.  \n\nDespite these processes, I still go to reviews and meetings where I get called out for having conflicting information.  When I’m asked why they don’t match, I’ve always had to say, “I don’t know.”  I created the process flow as well as the updates process and trained everyone on how to use it.  This means I get blamed when they’re wrong.  \n\nThis week, the account manager on one account usurped the authority of the program manager on his account and started leading the review meetings.  His approach is very antagonistic, so we spend an hour with this guy griping and complaining the whole time.  After two days of this, I suggested the members of the team (me included) get together for a meeting prior to this to compare notes and make sure we are on the same page with everything so this guy can’t pit us against one another.  \n\nIn the meeting, the program manager is updating the documentation for the deliverables.  When another guy tells him something is changing, the program manager looks at my deliverables and changes the dates on those, too.  This is where the problem comes in and I realize this is why my dates are always off – he’s not following the process and is just changing them on the fly, causing the mis-match.  \n\nI point this out to the guy and tell him we have a process (which he already knows).  He does his “putting my foot down” speech and says it’s his account and his responsibility to make changes.  He says he’ll get approval later in the day (but the guy approving isn’t in) and that he’ll handle it.  I tell him I’m not comfortable with that approach.  He says, “Too bad for you.  I’m comfortable with it and that’s all that matters.”  This conversation goes on for a little bit with him saying he always does it this way and that it’s never been an issue – except that it HAS been an issue, and I’ve been the one getting blamed and not him.  \n\nI say, “Okay, fair enough, but keep in mind that when we get in this next meeting and every other meeting after that, when someone tries to take a shit on me and asks me why the dates aren’t the same, I can no longer say, ‘I don’t know.’  From now on, I have to say, ‘He did it!’ because that’s exactly what you’re doing.”  \n\nHe backs down and says he’ll follow the process, indicating that he was fine with me getting blamed for it, but he’s not okay with getting blamed for it himself when he’s the one who has been doing it the whole time.  After both meetings are over, I get an email from this guy to me and another guy asking us to “verify” the changes from this week and the previous week.  We typically have about five to ten of these changes a week that get made.  This is the first time I ever received an email from him asking me to verify the changes, leading me to believe he was making these changes for months without ever getting approval, which explains why it always comes back being inconsistent.  At the same time, any time I would ask him about the approval, I would send him an email detailing them, so I’d get a response back saying, “These have been approved.”  Now, I’m going to have to add, “Have these been approved by [approver]?”  \n\nTl;dr:  I keep getting blamed for inconsistencies in documentation while the guy causing the changes is perfectly fine creating the issue and letting me get blamed for it.  Following the process isn’t important to him while someone else is getting blamed, but as soon as it’s suggested I’m not going to accept being blamed, he says he’ll follow the process.  \n",

        "text": "Years ago, I had this guy who worked for me who started our really great, but then, got more and more strange as time progressed.  This guy was never on time for work.  We went on a business trip to our corporate office one time and had agreed we would meet for breakfast before walking across the street from the hotel to the office.  When morning came, I knocked on his door.  He was up and dressed, but said he wasn’t ready yet.  I went and had breakfast, then went to the office.  He still showed up 45 minutes late with no explanation.  \n\nWe go on another business trip where he takes a later flight than I took.  Two other co-workers and I go to pick this guy up at the airport.  He’s texting me that he’s outside on the curb and we should see him because no one else is around him.  This airport has arrivals and departures on two levels.  We’re making laps around the arrival area looking for this guy.  He keeps texting more information, like what airline he took.  Still, we can’t find him.  Eventually, I say, “If I was [bad employee], where would I be?”  I figured it out.  He was at “Departures.”  Why?  In his mind, he’d already arrived at the airport.  That was the level he was on, so he got his bags and went down to “Departures,” so he could depart from the airport.  Sure enough, he’s sitting outside on the Departures level.  \n\nSoon, the guy starts saying I had it out for him and that I was making him stressed out by asking him to do his job every day.  HR talked to me about it and I pointed out the numerous issues I had with his work, including the tardiness.  One day, he tells me he has a phone appointment with HR at 1:00, so he’ll be unavailable if I need him.  That day, around 12:00, he tells me he’s going to lunch.  I remind him of his appointment with HR.  He tells me it’s completely slipped his mind.  At 1:15, I get a call from HR, asking me where this guy is.  I tell HR that I’d even reminded him to be on time for his HR appointment, the one to discuss his tardiness, the same one he said I was exaggerating.  \n\nThis guy starts having a lot of doctor appointments and brings me sick notes all the time.  The doctor is an addiction therapist.  His website talks about recovery from drug addictions.  Then, he starts bringing forged notes.  They’re previous notes that he’s copied, scratched out the date, and put a new date.  \n\nAround this time, HR tells me this guy has started a lawsuit against the company for discrimination and other things.  They tell me to not make things worse while they sort things out.  Meanwhile, this guy has notes from his doctor that say he can’t stand for very long, can’t lift more than 10 pounds, and several other things.  I buy him a cart for the office and make sure he has a chair everywhere he goes and tell him to let me know if he needs anything.  \n\nThis guy continues to show up late, at least 45 minutes every day, sometimes as much as two hours.  HR won’t let me get rid of him.  Everything I say, he turns into something wrong that I did.  I ask him to call some people.  He says he can’t because his throat hurts and he can’t use his “phone voice.”  I ask him to work on the inventory.  He says he can’t because his eyes hurt and he can’t find his glasses.  Any time I asked him to do something, he had an excuse, like one time, he couldn’t find his jacket, the jacket he never even brought in the building. Still, HR won’t let me get rid of the guy.  \n\nI got tired of asking this guy to do things and having the guy tell me he couldn’t do them, so I took a different approach.  When he showed up for work, I would ask him, “What are you able to do today?”  and I’d follow that with, “If you can’t find some productive work to do, I have to send you home without pay.”  Not surprisingly, this guy would find things to do.  At times, I’d find a reason to help him, like lifting a laptop and putting it on the cart for him.  I had people coming to me laughing and asking me if this was a joke.  The guy would wheel a cart around the office with one laptop on it and when he got to where it was going, he’d park the cart and ask another employee to remove the laptop for him because his doctor told him he couldn’t lift anything heavier than 10 pounds and he didn’t want to take any chances, even though the laptop was probably only three pounds.  \n\nOne day, he complains to HR that I was yelling at him and making him feel threatened.  HR set up a meeting with my boss, this guy, and me.  This guy and I were in my office.  HR and my boss were on the phone.  This guy tells a story of several examples of times I made him feel “unsafe” with my actions.  The best one was (he claimed) I was in the lobby.  He was 30 feet away, seated on the other side of the conference room.  I playfully punched a guy in the shoulder.  This guy, across the room, says he felt threatened.  So, we listen to all these stories.  HR asks him what I said or did specifically the previous day that was yelling.  He wouldn’t answer.  My boss started asking direct questions, “Was he cursing?  Was he raising his voice?”  Bad employee says, “It was just general yelling, you know, yelling.”  My boss keeps asking him questions.  He keeps evading them.  Finally, I say, “He’s asking you for the specific things I said when you said I was yelling.”  Bad employee says, “There, he’s doing it again!” Both my boss and HR have a fit that this guy is trying to say I’m yelling at him when I’m talking in a normal tone.  \n\nThis gets even worse when the head of another department approaches me one morning and says bad employee was installing software on one of his computers, something he shouldn’t have been doing.  When I ask bad employee about it, he says this guy is lying and that the department head is a racist who has it out for him.  He calls HR and demands this guy be fired.  HR asks me to investigate.  I find out bad employee did do what he wasn’t supposed to do, but he insists he didn’t.  He says another guy was installing the software.  I ask that guy.  That guy says it wasn’t him, but bad employee.  So, I get the two of them together and I’m pointing at them one at a time.  “Where were you?”  Other employee says he was standing.  Bad employee confirms.  “Where were you?”  Bad employee says he was seated at the computer.  Other employee confirms.  “Where were your hands?”  Other employee said his hands were in his pockets.  “Where were your hands?”  Bad employee had one hand on the mouse and one hand on the keyboard.  I say, “Okay, so you say [other employee] installed the software, but you were seated at the computer with a hand on the mouse and a hand on the keyboard.  Can you explain to me how [other employee] installed the software if he was five feet away from the computer with his hands in his pockets saying, ‘Stop installing that software!’ because ‘Stop installing the software’ is a really strange thing to say to someone who isn’t installing any software.”  Bad employee says, “I thought it was weird, too.  I wasn’t installing any software.  [other employee] was.”  \n\nEventually, bad employee admitted to installing the software, but still wanted that department head fired because he’d said “bummer” and “bummer” sounds a lot like “beaner” and even though bad employee isn’t Mexican and department head didn’t say “beaner,” there were implications that bad employee was a Mexican and if he was a Mexican, hearing the word “bummer” might sound like the word “beaner,” which would be offensive, so department head should be fired for saying a word similar to a racial slur not directed at bad employee.  \n\nNow, imagine every time this happens, I had to document it.  I had page after page of documentation from this guy.  Eventually, this guy’s attorney pressed for a settlement and the company’s attorney declined.  Bad employee quit the job and I never heard from him again.  Problem solved.  \n",

        "text": "There’s an account manager at my work who is off his rocker.  I think the guy has been drinking the corporate kool-aid so long, he doesn’t even realize how full of shit he is any more.  About six weeks ago, he and my boss had been going back and forth on where each of us (other guys in my role) would be assigned to give us the best chance of succeeding in some difficult projects we have.  For a week or two, I kept hearing things from my boss and from other members of the team, but the account manager was mostly avoiding me.  \n\nOne day, he walks into a meeting with my co-workers and me.  He points at one of them, “Shawn, are we clear?”  \n\nShawn says, “Yep, we’re clear!”  \n\n“Drake, are we clear?”  He asks.\n\n“Yep, we’re clear,” Drake says.  \n\n“Azzizzi, are we clear?”  He asks me.  \n\n“What the fuck are you talking about?”  I asked.  This guy curses a lot in just about every conversation, so this wasn’t out of line.\n\n“Your assignment,” He says.  “Are we clear?  We need to be absolutely crystal clear.”  \n\n“Okay,” I said.  “If you tell me, I will be clear.  I’ve been hearing all kinds of things that no one has ever told me directly.”  \n\nWhen he tells us what our assignments are, it’s nothing like what any of us heard from our boss.  We all disagree and tell him this was different from our understanding.  So, he throws a fit, leaves the room, and calls our boss.  Later we had a meeting with our boss and the account manager to clarify, and this turned out to be different yet again.  \n\nA week later, the account manager asked me about another project and asked me how it was going.  I pointed out that this wasn’t my project.  He flips out again, saying it was.  My boss gets involved again and I get the project assigned to me.  \n\nNext, we’re getting ready to go to a meeting with the customer.  I get there early because I have to set up to present.  The account manager, I’ll call him “Grumpy,” comes in and asks me if I’ve had a chance to look at an email he sent me about “Project X.”\n\n“Nope,” I said.  “I didn’t see an email from you on that.  Besides, that’s Shawn’s project.”  \n\n“We’ve been over this,” Grumpy said.  “It’s your job.  That’s YOUR project.”  \n\n“Nope, Shawn,” I said.  \n\n“No, no, no!”  He says.  “We’ve been over this.  It’s you.  Project X belongs to you.  It’s your job.  Handle it.”\n\n“Okay,” I said.  “If it’s me, why is Shawn going to all the meetings for that project with you?  Why isn’t it me?”  \n\nGrumpy sat there and looked like he was thinking for a minute, then said, “You guy change this up so much, I can’t keep track.”  \n\n“I haven’t changed it once,” I said.  \n\n“Okay, well, I still need your inputs on Project X,” He insists.  “Respond as soon as you can.”\n\n“To what?”  I asked.  “I didn’t get an email from you about this.”  \n\n“You didn’t get it?”  He asked.  He was serious.  The man didn’t send me an email and he was doubting me when I said I didn’t get it.\n\nIn the customer meeting, Grumpy sat beside me.  Shawn sat across from me.  Several times in the meeting, Grumpy defers questions about the status of Shawn’s projects to me.  When he did, I would look at Shawn and would say, “Shawn?”  It was pretty funny to me.  I didn’t have to worry about it making me look like I didn’t know what I was talking about.  The customer knew it was all Shawn’s stuff he was deferring to me.  The customer was in the meetings with Shawn.  To make it even more funny, Grumpy is sitting to my right.  The customer is on the other side of that.  So, whenever Grumpy turns to me, the customer is turning to Shawn.  \n\nAfter the meeting, I’m there with Grumpy and Shawn.  Grumpy says, “I’m going to need a response on that email.”  \n\n“The one you didn’t send me?”  I asked.  \n\n“Yeah, that one,” Grumpy says.  \n\n“Okay, I still didn’t receive it,” I assured him, trying not to sound like a dick.  “It’s Shawn’s project.”\n\nGrumpy looks miffed, then says, “Right, whatever.  I don’t care as long as someone gives me an update.”  \n\nFrom there, I left and let Grumpy and Shawn talk about the email I never got on the project that isn’t mine.  I go back to the office and start working on my work.  An hour later, Grumpy comes by my office and starts talking like he always did.  I could be on the phone and talking or running a meeting and this guy would just start talking over whatever I was doing.  In this case, I was working on a spreadsheet, so it was no big deal.  \n\n“I need that input right away!”  He says.  \n\n“What input?”  I asked.  \n\n“The status on Project X!”  He sounds annoyed.  “I’ve been asking you for it all morning.”  \n\n“Hang on,” I said.  By now, my boss is aware that this guy is asking me for something that isn’t mine and that I have no idea about.  Those two were on a meeting earlier and I’d already explained to my boss that this madman has been hounding me for something that’s someone else’s job and he hasn’t even sent it to me in the first place.  “Is this about that same email?”  \n\n“Yes,” He says, sounding like it should be obvious.  \n\n“The same email that you didn’t send me? And the same email that you should be bugging Shawn about?  Because if that’s it, I swear to God, I’ll go with you to your office and I’ll send that email to me so I can just do it and get you off my back.”  \n\nGrumpy stands there looking like I’d punched him and appears to be thinking of what to say next.  He turns and starts to walk away.  \n\n“Am I following you?”  I asked.  \n\n“No, no,” He says.  “I’ll go talk to Shawn about this.”  \n\nThat was mostly the last of it for that one, except he would later remember it as him being late for delivering something because I couldn’t follow simple instructions, but I can never let silly shit like that go.  When he said something vague about it as a put-down on a call with my boss and his boss, I said something like, “Oh, right, the email you never sent me but kept asking me about.  I’m still willing to do it if you ever tell me what it was.”  \n",

        "text": "WARNING:  Some of the words in this story may be offensive to some readers.  \n\nWhere I work, I have to deal with an account manager who is a real asshole.  He’s one of these guys who is the cause of most of the problems, but he thinks he’s on the side of the solution.  Often, he’ll cause a big problem that someone on my team (typically me) will have to fix.  And, like all micro managers, this guy wants it done NOW!  This week is a good example of that.  He knows I have a full schedule, which includes some evening and early-morning work, but he came up with this thing he said he needs revised by Friday.  This is on purpose.  He knows I’ll be too busy to do it by then, so when we meet on Friday, he’ll be sure to tell me that he absolutely needs it no later than first thing Monday morning with the implication that I’m supposed to work all weekend to get it done for him.  \n\nSituations like that happen all the time with this guy.  If it actually is something that’s important and urgent, I’ll work on it.  If it’s a case of him crying wolf, I just ignore it and get to it when I can.  We had one day a while back when it was around 5:15, which really isn’t that late in the day in an office environment, but he was telling me he needed me to do something for him that was going to take me five or six hours to complete and he was trying to impress upon me that he needed it done that night.  \n\nI told him I had to go to counseling with my ex-wife over some issues she was having with our son.  This was true.  My ex-wife is something else.  Like this guy, she causes problems and thinks she’s the one with the solution.  I never told him anything about my ex-wife, but he had to chime in anyway. This was in a conference room with this manager, a guy I call “Grumpy” and his ass-kissing sidekick, a guy I call “Hippy.”  \n\n“You know what cunt means?”  He asked me.  \n\nHippy is smiling, like he knows what this guy is about to say.  \n\n“Yes,” I said.  “I believe I do,” I had no idea what this had to do with me going to see a counselor with my ex-wife.  I thought he was about to call me a cunt.  \n\n“It’s an acronym.  It means, ‘Can’t Understand Normal Thinking’,” He looks triumphant.  \n\n“Okay,” I said.  \n\n“So, when you’re talking about a woman, keep that in mind,” He says.  “They’re all cunts.”  \n\nThis guy curses a lot.  I curse a lot.  We all curse a lot.  I don’t think this rant of his is the same thing, though.  \n\n“I don’t know if I agree with that,” I said.  “Very few women, my ex-wife included, I don’t think I would say ‘all’.”  \n\n“Just give it some time,” He says.  “You’ll figure it out.”  \n\nThis was a fairly normal conversation with this guy.  It took him a while to break the habit of blurting out anything that came to his mind.  He still does it, but less frequently.  \n",

        "text": "Backstory and nickname:\n\nOur company runs a lot like the federal government. We don't make a profit, we have incompetent people that chase away the competent ones and senior leadership that won't fire anyone. Because of senior leaderships unwillingness to fire it has seeped into every department which is why I have tons of fodder for these but I digress.\n\nI work in a cubicle farm. The only offices are for management and one guy they moved because he was offending everyone around him.\n\nOne of these fine managers is mr. shrinky. You maybe wondering why he got this name. I certainly wasn't but sure enough I found out on the first day of work for our departments intern. The intern's name was a roman emperors, we will use Augustus. Now apparently mr. Shrinky' old platoon buddy was also named Augustus cue his long winded stories about the army. At the time I thought the intern was being nice looking back he was just a strange guy but he kept asking questions. After a story about a buddy in his platoon nicknamed tank our intern asked if mr. Shrinky had a nickname. \n\nKeep in mind the cubical farm layout makes your voice travel far so although I wanted nothing to do with this conversation or any of the others I couldn't not hear. He responded \"oh yes! One day we were on a training excursion that was 4 days. Well after the second grueling day in the woods we came upon a creek. We all wanted to get clean so we all stripped down and waded in which is where I got the name Shrinky.\" \n\nDeath by crop dusting:\n\nThis story is from when I first moved over to my current department, we had a mail lady the nicest person you could meet but older and not all there. She retired and we all miss her very much more on her later. Mr.Shrinky was her direct boss. He heads up billing and operations which is just the mailroom now.\n\nNow mail lady lost her husband unexpectedly to a heart attack and took some needed pto, we don't have bereavement leave. Mr. Shrinky wants to do something nice for her and instead of getting flowers like a normal human he remembers when H.R. Got the office to sign a matted framed picture for another coworkers 80th birthday photo take at the office cookout with an article about the man contributions to the company. He decides this is a nice idea and gets a copy of the obituary printed and put into a matted frame and brings it around to the entire office to sign (r/sadcringe). \n\nAs he was bringing it around he apparently had some stomach issues because every department i have spoken to all said the same thing; he brought it over and left quickly then they were hit with the sewage smell. The man crop dusted the entire office while getting this ridiculous borderline offensive thing signed. \n\nMail lady leaves\n\nWe have this tradition that when you have a work anniversary or retirement your boss has to say a few words about you usually less then ten minutes and is supposed to be funny. Mail lady retired this year and we had a party. Mr. Shrinky gets up to speak and thirty minutes after his speech started he decides to read her a poem that he read to his kids when they were growing up. Cute right? This poem is three pages long. Mr. Shrinky can't even get through it and starts crying in front of the entire office making poor mail lady cry as well. \n\nBreakfast of champions \n\nI mentioned the 80year old earlier, he was a much beloved part time employee that worked with mail lady to keep the office stocked and running smoothly. after mr. Shrinky forced his retirement without replacement we discovered he did a whole lot more then management knew about. One of those things was ordering doughnuts, bagels or the like for our monthly breakfast employee update meeting. \n\nSuddenly it's the day before and mr. Shrinky didn't have anyone to do it but himself so off to the store he goes. The next morning he casually mentions how twinkles are the breakfast of champions to one of my (diabetic) coworkers she laughs it off until we have the meeting. Keep in mind most people skip breakfast this day so you have 50 plus hungry people waiting for breakfast. \n\nWhat's for breakfast? Twinkies and hohos 4 boxes of each thankfully mail lady rushed to the store when she realized what he was doing but he only let her get a bunch of bananas and a bag of apples because he had already spent the budget on hostess snacks. Out of 50plus people only 3 twinkies were taken and 5 hohos all of the fruit was gone immediately. We now rotate departments to purchase breakfast because of mr.shrinky\n\nPrivacy what's privacy?\n\nWe had a girl on maternity leave from underwriting, they have great relationships with their agents but at the end of the day the agent is a customer. Agent calls in to the mailroom new mail girl gets mr.shrinky the agent ask for address to send the underwriter flowers mr. Shrinky thankfully doesn't have her personal information and goes to look for her boss to get the information to send to agent. \n\nLuckily an assistant hears why he is looking for boss and says, mr. Shrinky why would you give out someone's home address without permission? He looks incredulous and says \"they want to send her flowers what would you do?\" The assistant said \"have them send the flowers here and we will get someone to bring them to her or she can come pick them up. \"\n\nShe came in later that day with baby in tow the first person she sees is mr. shrinky and of course what does he say? \"Look at you, up and walking around where is the wheelchair?\" \n\nThanks for reading this installment of Mr. Shrinky . I have many more about him and others in our office that I will post later!\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It’s been a while since I’ve updated on the trials and tribulations of what my  fellow employee, That Dumb Coworker (known, by her own request, as DA, or 'Duh'), puts the rest of us through [First post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/58ckw7/the_excel_sheet_of_utter_confusion/ )\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt’s not for a lack of material, as I’m about to share plenty of that, but more out of a sense of disbelief that SHE IS STILL EMPLOYED.  Let me be clear: I do not begrudge her, or anyone, the right to make a living.  It’s been a struggle, but I have NOT, as last recommended, advocated [very strongly] for her to be fired. Not necessarily because I’m a good person but more “not my circus, not my monkeys;” I have enough work to do, thank you. Let the ones with the title of “manager” figure it out. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat I can do, however, is vent to help keep me sane. Thus, let me regale you in the Tales of Dumbassery, Part II: from Halloween to Now, retold in as much order as I can remember (tell me YOU wouldn’t try to block some of this out). \n\n &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n-----\n\nShortly after we left DA last time, she stopped talking to me. She was REALLY MAD about the Excel Sheet of Utter Confusion and refused to Elsa that shit [let it go] for MONTHS. Starting from the time of my last post, for WEEKS after, she'd bang her fists on her desk whenever I’d walk by because she “hated my high heels.” She claimed that I’d walk purposely louder when I was near her, and she knew this because it was quieter after I walked away. I ended up snapping at her to look up Doppler Effect but she told me no because it didn’t count. (What didn’t count? Who the fuck knows with this lady. From other things I’ve gathered about her / she’s said, she’s not a “believer in science.” I don't think she knows Doppler from a helicopter.)  She refused to copy me on all-office e-mails or to transfer phone calls to me. I filed a complaint (and, ftr, was told she’d be fired. Uh-huh.) but not a lot [read: nothing] came from it. She seemed to calm down by early December.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’m going to pause here and mention that in the moment of my writing this, she is blowing her nose, very loudly, in the front lobby. In front of someone waiting for the COO. Oh… she just spit into the wastebasket. The man has now asked her if she’s well – and I can tell you, even as I listen, I know where this is going. He will get a full report on her health and her life. Sorry, gent. “Haha that came from my lungs!” she just told him.\n\nSigh.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n------------\n\nIn-between my first post and the above, the company did some shuffling and the person she reported to changed. This is important only in it pertaining to the peripheral, which is that two people claim to be the person she reports to, and neither likes the other, or her. (This is really a fun place to work, yes.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOne day in November, we had board members in, and she was asked to order a catered lunch for them, our head team, and a couple other guests. She was asked this just after 8 am, and to have it for 11 am (as most of the members are from back east, and working on that time zone, so to speak). By 1 pm, everyone was pissed off and starving – no lunch had come. Turns out she ordered it from Jimmy Johns (yes, THAT’s what we ought to serve board members) TWENTY MILES AWAY. How she Googled it and called a place THAT far away, I do not know.  I would also like to say that this was only the first time she’d done this. It happened again a few months later.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBecause of this, I’ve been asked a few times to take over ordering the catered lunches. I have to admit to how much this irks me, as while it is not difficult (despite evidence to the contrary) there should be utterly NO reason for the VP of Op to ask me to do it simply because “it’s confusing to DA.”\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n*A Study In How Not To People, by DA:*\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nLook, this lady has a LOT of difficulty when dealing with people in person (okay, yes, she has a lot of difficulty in dealing with ANYTHING, period, but) and quite honestly, I’ve no idea how so many of them manage to keep their WTFery to themselves.  I don’t know how ANY of us do? (Well, I try to be professional, and yes, I frequently wonder why I bother.)  Can you actually imagine being face-to-face with someone like DA? Much like the Spanish Inquisition, there is NO expecting *her.* A few examples: \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nSomeone walked into see our HR manager back in March:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; DA: hi can I help you?\n&gt;             \n&gt; Lady: I'm here to see HR.\n&gt;             \n&gt; DA: okay can I let him know who is calling?\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nShe asked this, looking directly at the woman. Like, I KNOW I've used the phrase \"the pause was palpable\" a few times when discussing DA, but it's SO TRUE, entirely too often.  A generous person may be inclined to say DA was just being Victorian, but yeahno. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n“May I have your calling card, sir?” \n\n“HR, ARE YOU AT HOME TO VISITORS?”\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nThis one is also from back in March, when our ownership was in town. Someone came in at the request of the COO to discuss [fuck knows what].  He comes in and asks for the COO [“Jim”] by name: \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; Al: \"hi I'm here to see Jim.\"\n&gt;     \n&gt; DA: \"you want Jim?\"\n&gt;     \n&gt; Al: Yes\n&gt;     \n&gt; DA: I don't know if he's available...he doesn't work here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Al: Oh, he is, he just called me to confirm our appointment at this location. \n&gt;     \n&gt; DA: well, I don't think he's here. he works in [PNW] so he’s not here. That’s a long way from [our location].\n&gt;     \n&gt; Al: [PREGNANT PAUSE] right, but he's in town this week…he just called me from here.\n&gt;    \n&gt; DA: OH MAYBE? I'll check. What's your name?\n&gt;     \n&gt; Al: Al. \n&gt;     \n&gt; DA: Okay Al! And who did you want to see?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n    \nFor what it’s worth, I had told her Jim et al were here when she got in that morning. You see, I had to tell her because she was late. Again. And no one else would tell her because everyone hates her. (Everyone hates everyone else here. I did mention this place is fun?)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOkay, I’m interrupting myself here again because she’s singing to a supplier that just came in.  She’s been talked to (as recently as last week, and it’s something ELSE that I know about this [as in, I was told about it by the person who reprimanded her]) about her “baby voice,” her “giggling,” her “gasping,” (I’ll get into that in a mo), and her chatting with people. So a supplier just came in and asked for the PA he works with. DA went to find her, and came back legit singing “fooooound her found her I found found found her for yooooouu!” and finished it off with a giggle. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn April, someone came in for a job interview, for a position we really needed filled (and still haven’t filled I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY PEOPLE RUN AWAY FROM HERE AT FIRST GLANCE REALLY I CANNOT).  Now, for this one, I mostly got it second hand from the GM, but I heard bits of it as it was happening.  GM had an interview with someone at 2 pm that afternoon.  I was working on something else that’s time sensitive that someone else in my department usually manages, but I was covering.  Normally the GM sits in on these things but ownership had called a meeting, and thus I was texting the GM in case he wanted to offer input (again, time sensitive). \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBefore he went into the meeting, as he came up the stairs, he said to DA “I’m going into the upstairs conference room; let me know when [interviewee] is here.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAt 3:05 I hear the GM slam out of the conference room and downstairs, apologizing to the gentleman in the lobby for his tardiness. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe next morning I’m discussing something with him and he abruptly says “thank you for texting me yesterday to keep me in the loop with [time sensitive thing]. I shouldn’t have to say this again but I do bring my phone with me to meetings for a reason. I’ve told you that, yes? I’ve told everyone that.”   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYeah, there’s not a lot of need for foreshadowing here, is there?  The interviewee came at 2. At 2:55 DA texted GM “you know, your interview has been here for almost an hour... he says if you don’t want to see him just let me know to tell him.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n(Yes, it strikes me that, as I’m typing these, they’re not as funny as they appeared before [well, most of them aren’t; “being Victorian” will always be hilarious]. It could be they’re more detrimental to the well-being of the company [which so few here seem to gaf about] or it could be that working with these people plus the vitriol and pettiness has my anxiety at an all-time high [spoiler alert: it is] that I’m having trouble finding the humor in anything recently, let alone this.) \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo, nothing happened to her, other than a \"talking to.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\n---------\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’ll try to bring it back to the funny in a mo, but here’s snippet of what I sent to my Slack girls a few weeks ago:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n“How long have I complained about DA here? She’s been here since March of 2016. And she just sent an inside sales call from our biggest customer (should have gone to me) to shipping. Then to the new estimator (this is the guy I had to teach how to copy and paste in Excel the other day; it’s a work in [not so much] progress).\n\nThe board is coming in tomorrow, owners are in today, my sales buddy is out so I'm doing MY job, my side-job of IT, some of DA's stuff (cuz, as her BOSS'S BOSS SAID, \"it's too complicated for her [ to order lunch AGAIN],\" AND co-dept’s stuff (including two [time sensitive money makers)]. That was the THIRD CALL she fucked up today. what on EARTH.”\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*Still on the lack of people skills:* \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn January (on the 20th, to be exact…yes, _that_ day) she decided to start listening to talk / news radio instead of her usual country station [that she enjoys singing along to].  Yes, this decision coincided with the inauguration here in the US.  And yes, most everyone, myself included, have Many Things to Say about it all, in one way or another. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n(Interrupting meself yet again: just saw a news alert come through that stated “sunshine makes you dumber.” Perhaps it would be to the benefit of all if we moved HER to the PNW location. This bears investigating.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI think it’s safe to say that no matter which side of the current line you fancy yourself, you “get” that there’s someone on the opposite side with feelings are strong as yours, amirite? I mean, MOST PEOPLE get that (whether they pretend to or not).  And that there is a time and a place to discuss said feelings and situation, and work may not be that place?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYou and me, reader, may get that, Yeah no, not DA though!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNope. She decided to listen to the inauguration at full volume. At the front desk. In the front lobby. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYeah. I mean, not horribly egregious I suppose, though a bit of a wincer, given that politics and work are not a good combo generally, yeah?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYou’d think that'd be it. You’d be wrong. Because she proceeded to tell everyone:  fellow employees, the office supply delivery man, suppliers, VISITING CUSTOMERS et al how great Trump is and, if anyone disagreed (and there was sustainable pushback to her)  how, why, and in what ways they were wrong.  Loudly. Over and over. Not just during inauguration, but since at many times.  She cheered at the man, the pizza, and the gun (that’s all you’re getting from me; it’s a bit like Beetlejuice, innit?) and told EVERYONE about how she felt ABOUT EVERYTHING political related (that she understood, so, I mean, not much, but it’s not the quality of the content I’m commenting on, tbf).  Without provocation or permission.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI am boggling all over as I type this. I repeat: most of us recognize that discussing politics at work can be a rather bad thing. Discussing politics with people you don’t know can also be dangerous. Combine the two, and add in that this election in particular has made a lot more people a lot more vocal (and, ftr, I find this to be a Good Thing as a general rule) and I just do not understand how she’s so bloody oblivious. And such a fucking arsehole, too. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n-----\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nShe’s currently not talking to me again and while I’m very saddened by this development, I’m also confused as to how it came about. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nPicture it, Sicily, 1922. (Or, you know, North America, last week, 2017.) \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHR was at our other location, AR was PTO/MTO. As those are the two that normally cover for DA when she wanders off and/or goes on break, it was asked that I cover phones/desk when she went on break. And let me tell you, she is more regular about her smoke breaks than Sheldon is on high-fiber Fridays.  She can’t get here on time, EVER (and I appreciate being late to a meeting on Wednesday because it took her 40 extra minutes to decide to show up, truly I do) but she will make sure she’s outside smoking at 10:15 and 1:15 every day.  (I’d say I get it, because I used to be a smoker, but I don’t get it. Probably because I have a work ethic.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI also cannot hear the phone as well from my desk (which is pretty much the ONLY thing I can’t hear from here, but it’s set up that way on purpose).  Not that she ever said anything TO me, but I did hear her say, to herself, that “the phone is ringing can’t you answer it Jeebas.” when she had walked away to talk / gossip / tell someone her political views.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOn Thursday, I heard her talking to someone on the phone – she was pretty worked up. She ended up patching the call through to our VP of OP (one of her two possible bosses) and said, very loudly, “IT’S SOMEONE CALLING FOR THE FRONT DESK POSITION” before she slammed the phone done. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYes, I agree; pretty shitty AND about time, yeah? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYeah, not quite. Because of fucking course not. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nA little bit later, I hear the phone ringing so I grab it, then head downstairs to see where she went. Turns out no one has been able to find her for a half an hour. Why? She’s in with the VP of Ops. Okay, fair enough, despite the lack of warning to anyone covering for her.  One of the PAs says to me that she noticed “Mel,” our VP of Ops, on a job search site yesterday and that he was angry.  A little bit after that, Mel asked me to come see him. So I did. He closed the door, and proceeded to tell me that he’d found DA’s resume online, and that he told her he “absolutely” had “put feelers out” because he wasn’t going to let her “leave us high and dry without a warning.”  Hence...the call. Fair enough…although not my business to know. But okay. He then went on to say that he told her to straighten her ass out. That everyone sees her as incompetent, clueless, and unhelpful.  At this point, and it’s clear as mud to me how, I was brought up. HE claims he told her to ask me for help, as I am “smart and always willing to help” others.  Do I have my doubts? Yeah. But it is possible that alone (and/or with my “lack of help”) has her refusing to talk to me.  (This is also the time she was told to cull the baby talk and giggles, as well as her “jumping and screaming” every time someone walks to the front desk / calls her extension.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat refusal of talking, btw, extended yesterday to not giving me a phone call when MY customer called for me. She gave it to my office-mate. She “forgot/didn’t know” I handled that company. Despite knowing that for the last 1.5 years, anyway.  She’s NEW at this, okay?? :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAdjacent: after this crap on Thursday, she called on Friday and Monday. I mean, that’s what _I_ would do too if my job were in question, same for all of you, no?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are SO many other things. SO MANY. But even I’m bored of typing them all out. In quick list form, some of the things I DIDN’T have the willpower to touch upon:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n- Phone lists: extensions were changed. Her job was to create a new Excel (ahhahahah I KNOW, hunties; I. Know.) sheet with everyone’s name and corresponding extension.  That was to be started, and finished 20 April.  It’s still not correct; the last mass e-mail that went out was sent 5/1 (with a follow-up STILL wrong later that same day). She’s “worked” on it; I know this because twice since then I’ve listened to her dial everyone’s extension to “see if it worked and who picked up.”  Side note: she came back to work yesterday, and one of the first calls she took was for Dan. She hemmed and hawed with Dan’s call on hold until she called Dan’s cube mate to ask what Dan’s extension was. (Phone list 5 May The First says 874, 5 May 1.2 says 642. Neither, btw, is correct.) \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n - Running out of supplies is a common theme. She blames everyone else for never telling her things are low. Does that suck? Yeah. Did I warn her that was a thing? Yeah. Did I tell her she needed to keep inventory lists? Yeah. Does she? Yeah. So how are we always out of even the most basic things? Because she’s DA, that’s how. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n(Interrupting time: she just took a snarky potshot at the fact I had a long lunch with my team yesterday – to HR. Was I gone 2 hours yesterday for lunch? Yup. I also had already worked almost 30 hours by that point, never mind covering for her last week – including not being able to take lunch so that she could. I hate I’m justifying this but oh my god this bitch makes me angry.) \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n--\n\n-  *Title*: this is her new thing to ask people when they call. They’ll ask for someone (who is here still with the company, or, more often not) and she’ll ask where they’re calling from. She’ll then ask if they’re a sales / solicitation call. You can imagine how that goes: \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt; DA:  Are you a sales call?\n\n&gt; Definitely Not A Sales Caller: …no.\n\n&gt; DA: OH, okay, then you want to talk to [person, department, extension]. Here’s their info, and one second, I’ll transfer you.\n&gt; \n&gt; [several minutes pass]\n&gt; \n&gt; [Person] calls up to DA: DA, why did you put a sales call through to me???\n\n&gt; DA: they weren’t a sales call, they said so!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd yes, that happens at least once a day, if not more.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n(However, she has taken to telling our AC / heater repair people that we don’t want to talk to them anymore because *they’re* an unwanted sales call [BUT THEY’RE NOT].)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n- This morning I was waiting for the break bell (she does this manually when the food truck comes, about 15 past 8. Most of our guys start at 5 am or 6; she gets here at 8 (well, she’s supposed to be here at eight – last week, 4/5 times, break was announced by someone else because she wasn’t bloody here yet) as I go for a walk every break (which she has also complained about). 8:25 rolls around and I hear \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt; Mel, yelling:  “Do you go get your food first THEN call break time?” \n&gt; \n&gt; DA: *giggle* Yup!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mel: “You mean the guys who have been working for hours wait longer, while you, who got here 10 minutes ago, go first?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBut, much like everything else she does, there is no consequence.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI don't even know what to say anymore. There's no wit or humor left in me over this situation, at least not today. I had thought that, after the first eight months in my last post, she/this situation would be a thing of the past. Maybe I'm the moron here, eh?\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n",

        "text": "I worked for a community college a couple of years back. At the time the cc was a god send for me. I was young and wanting to get into IT and was hired on as a support assistant in a computer lab. That was on paper but really the lab supported the whole college. And man, we did a great job. Information flowed from one employee to another without issue. We worked together in perfect harmony. Since we were so small there wasn't any rules except no food around the equipment and we thrived.\n\nBut it couldn’t last. The cc was growing. It decided it needed consultants to tell them how they should run the cc. And overnight it went from free range to lock and key corporate style. It hurt to watch us shrink. I survived many phases of layoffs until there was just 5 from the original 12 or so. Every time I came into work we were smaller and smaller.\n\nThen one day I came in and we weren't part of IT anymore. They didn't move us to a new department at all. Just explained we didn't belong under them anymore. No information was given to who we reported to. So we just existed in a state of nothingness for a couple of months during the restructure. They eventually moved us to Instructional Student Services. That’s sort of the information tech that manages IT classes. I settled in and my boss told me one day they don't know what to do with us in the computer lab. They ran class rooms but not computer labs. However it seemed a good fit. We got along with the Director of the department very well. So we just settled in to our new home.\n\nMonths later I came to work and boom, were part of the Library now. Specifically the Information Systems part. Okay so that was fine too. I got settled in again. Felt weird being a computer lab off site from the main library but we made it work. We got a reputation for the quit lab where people could study as the main library didn't enforce quietness. I started to like the job again.\n\nThen, one day, again, I came in, boom :( our computer lab, our workspace, belongs to another department now. You see another department wanted the computer lab but didn’t want the employees. They wanted to use their own people (Specially trained for their job). We were being kicked out and had to the end of the week. We're still employed as Library staff so we picked up or things and move to the main library. We go through training to be support staff. This strange new place is weird to me. It's a 180 to the environment I came from where we all supported each other. We were like the 'others' moving into this place. I and my fellow coworkers who survived the many department shifts and layoffs felt like outcast in this strange new place. We liked to work and see our results since were used to fixing and maintaining our lab. This place is all about meetings and setting up procedures. I got used to helping find resource with student in the library system and going to hour long meetings that were the same topic over and over. You can imagine not too much changes in a library over time. \n\nSlowly my team found new jobs or graduated out of the library. Our team is never replaced. The cc just closes the position permanently when we leave. \n\nIt was really sad to watch. It felt like I was floating every day and my job could just disappear.\n\nMy new job is much more stable now. I did take away a wealth of knowledge from the many departments and how government offices run. So that's a plus. Also they suck at handling resources but I think we all know that.\n",

I'll be so completely fucked when I get back that it almost makes it not even worth it.\n\nI cover for her when she's out, I don't leave tons of work waiting for her when she gets back. Who the hell wants to be worried about that while on vacation?",

Both were great employees, but the company decided to have a reduction in force, so they canned two guys with no other reason than \"to reduce headcount.\"  \n\nThis week, I was on a management call and the executive responsible said, \"We need to do an assessment of the impacts of having let those two go.\"  \n\nOne of the other managers said, \"Shouldn't you have done that before you let them go?\"  \n\nOne of the guys they let go was named Brian.  Every time someone asks who was working on something, I answer, \"Brian.\"  \n\nQ:  Didn't someone go out there?\n\nA:  Brian\n\nQ:  Wasn't that already done?\n\nA:  Brian\n\nQ:  That's a good job.  Who did that?  \n\nA:   Brian\n\n\nEdit to add:  We were on a meeting this morning.  One guy asked, \"What happens if we don't meet our numbers by the end of June?  Are we facing more cuts?\"  \n\nThe same guy who cut the previous two guys said, \"We're exempt from any more cuts,\" then went on to explain how we need to add more than 10 people to the team.  He was aware that we should have been exempt the first time around, too, because of how short-handed we already were, but he gets a benefit for cutting the two guys, so he let it happen.  ",

        "text": "*I just recently found this subreddit thanks to [/u/Gambatte](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gambatte) [most recent story](https://redd.it/60ttsp), and after some reading, I feel that a lot of my very own writing could be posted here. I originally hail from [/r/talesfromtechsupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/). Hopefully, the antics and madness that I am privileged enough to call my job will be more suited at times here, as they veer away from the technical side, and more to pure and simple alienation of office politics.*  \n--------------------------------------------------  \n  \n*First and foremost, a little background on the current situation, and overall cast of* ***HeadlessChicken Ltd ^1 .***  \n  \n+ $Me. Obviously, this is me. I am technically one of the few IT technicians. I'm also in charge of some parts of the network and telephony systems, as well as anything else no one will be able or bother to do. This will be explained further down.\n+ $ElPresidente. President of the company. Nice enough most of the time, but he can also be a nasty piece of work when things don't go exactly how he wants the to.\n+ $BossMan. Director of IT infrastructures. My direct boss. Younger than me, so a bit green and keen, but relaxed enough that things get done in a good mood.\n+ $BossLady. VP of IT. Very down to earth. Doesn't take crap from anyone. Often has to go head to head with $ElPresidente about the needs and budget of the department, as the entire services offered by the company depends on IT.\n+ $DoP. Senior director of project managements. In her late fifties, dragging on as long as she can to avoid retirement, but as I write this, her last day is tomorrow. Nice enough, but too often overlooks simple details that in turn, cause a chain reaction of consequences.  \n  \n*Anyone else beyond that will be named as they make an appearance. The turnover rate here is crazy, so often you'll read about someone once, and by next time I post, they might be gone.*  \n***And now, to give some background on the company...***  \n*We run contact centres across the province of Quebec ^2 . We have many clients of all types: Telcos, retails chains, financial services, etc. As I write these lines, we've just finished moving our head office to a new location. Most of what will be written about here either happened at the planing stage, during, or after the move. I also want to state that I had, up until now, absolutely zero experience in project management, and manglement in general. But I guess becoming a manager is just like riding a bike. You just need to get started, and after that, the momentum does the rest.*  \n  \n--------------------------------------------\n**We didn't start the fire**  \nI wasn't assigned to the project from the very beginning, and so, had no say or power in the location that was finally chosen. I got roped into it later on, after the contracts had already been signed, a project management company was hired, and a general contractor was signed on. Unfortunately for me, the company is as cheap as they come. We paid for a top tier project management (they did major mall centres here in Canada) and so, to cut costs on that^3 , the project director decided that some of the work to be done would have to be sourced by us. Mainly, anything network related, security, surveillance, and any other maintenance for system that were already on-site ^4 . With no previous project management experience, I was assigned the task of contracting a cabling company, a surveillance system (CCTV and what not) as well as the security access control (ID cards and all that). I have to say, the sourcing, quoting and all around contact with the different vendors was a wonderful experience, and I learned a great deal. \n  \nThe issue came up with the plans and the setup the general contractor had already planned. Floor plans were drawn up not by an architect or building company, but by a design company. Which, of course, have no idea what building code seem to be, and how to draw a floor plan to scale.  \nAs it turns out, they didn't notice that some of the doors they wanted to install weren't able to be an ingress/egress point, so that in case of fire, you couldn't open them manually with the help of a push-bar or door handle. This meant some of the floor plan had to be rethought and modifications had to be done to the original security layout. Thanks god we did catch it in time. **Why?** Because in Canada, fire code and regulations stipulate that:  \n  \n1. Any non complying building space cannot be occupied until it meets code specifications\n2. Fines of 2000$ per day of non compliance will be issued until specifications are met. This can only be verified and confirmed by a fire marshal.  \n  \nUpper management was very pleased with my findings, it goes without saying.  \n  \n------------------------------------------  \n**Size Doesn't Matter, right?**  \nAs mentioned in the first part, the floor plans where drawn by a design company. They looked very nice. And that's all that can be said about them that wouldn't be nasty.  \nI can claim (and with solid, physical evidence) that the floor plans, specifically those for furniture disposition, are not to scale. The base building plan was obtained through the building's management company, and from there, they went ahead and assumed things rather than contacting anyone to be sure of the proper measurements. As it turns out, the desks we use (rows of cubicles, looks very much like the feeding rows in a cattle stable) are wider than they expected. In the end, the moving company had to devise extra rows, and cut down some walking space, because the desks wouldn't fit in the space they were designed to.  \nIt's now been 2 months that this specific issue has been brought forth, and the design company still denies it.  \n  \n-----------------------------------------  \n**Musical chairs**  \nFor reasons beyond me, it seems that our operations department has the focusing and decisions making of a magic 8-ball in the hands of a three year old toddler. Constantly changing that is.  \nI've long given up on trying to understand their thought process, and am now on the way to giving up hope that one day, they will finally come to a decision, whatever it is.  \nIt turns out that they are constantly changing their needs in regard to meeting rooms vs training room vs closed office for clients vs break rooms vs torture rooms vs a pit in hell.  \nI have now send back Change Requests to my cabling vendor 4 times because suddenly, someone needs their desk moved  a couple feet away, or wants to be facing the other wall in the room, or we're going to convert a prayer room into a client office, and all of it of course, without mentioning it to us. At all.  \nAnd then make sure to complain loud and wide that there's no network and electricity ^5 and that said person hasn't been able to work for the past three days because of it.  \n*Bis repetita, ad nauseam*  \n  \n--------------------------------------  \n  \nAny last thought for now? Yes, as Einstein once said: *\"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.\"*  \n  \n  \n^1 : Aptly chosen name, as it often seems that the company is run in much the same way: running around blindly doing things, people hope, are the right ones to do.  \n^2 : Yes, I'm a filthy heathen. I speak French and I eat poutine. I thoroughly despise maple Syrup. I am not French Canadian though, I just leave there.  \n^3 : Because, obviously, signing someone cheaper was out of the question...  \n^4 : See [this previous tale](https://redd.it/5snd1i)  \n^5 : Another story, for another time.",

        "text": "Not so very long ago, I worked as the sole competent full time technical employee of a company. Now, you may think that this is not unusual, especially in smaller companies - and you'd be right.  \nExcept this company operated a service that was completely reliant on the IT systems having 100% up time - five 9s wasn't good enough, they demanded 100.0 flat.\n\nYou may now be thinking \"Well if IT was that important, then at least OP must have been well compensated, right?\" To which I say \"HA!\", and \"HA!\" again.\n\nThe system with such enormous up time requirements was a message receiving service; essentially, the company installed a monitoring unit which would immediately report any changes in the monitored systems (or, once every few minutes, send a keep-alive signal). One monitoring unit could monitor up to eight customer systems; the monitoring of these systems is/was a legal requirement, and the company had to constantly leap through legal hoops to make sure that they maintained the appropriate accreditation to be able to supply this service.\n\nI was one of the first employees of this company. At the time I left, I had been there more than twice as long as any other employee - including the CEO.\n\n---\n\nOne of the larger early contracts was an education establishment. This place had a large number of buildings, spread over a wide area. We were told that there were existing systems that we'd be directly replacing, so we'd only need six monitoring units (as each one could handle up to eight systems - 6 x 8 = 48 individual systems; more than enough to handle the 42 listed systems).  \nThen the first variation arrived. They'd forgotten about a whole section of the campus; add another three buildings and six systems.  \nAnd then the next variation. They'd put one system down twice, but left off another page of systems.\n\nBy the time the variations slowed to a dull roar, the 42 original systems had blown out to 72. Still, we were estimated at ten monitoring units - 9 x 8 = 72 + a spare so we don't have to ship one if there's a problem.\n\nThen the actual installs started.  \nBecause the establishment was in use, they insisted we wait until the students had left for Christmas - then complete the install and testing off all systems in under three weeks. These three weeks included Christmas and New Year's Day. Not that it helped, because the cabling that the establishment insisted was \"fine\" was actually full of water, badly degraded, poorly installed, all of which resulted in numerous earth faults and a huge amount of noise.\n\nIn the end, many monitoring units were put into single system mode and installed right on top of the monitored system. As you can imagine, the project had originally expected to (eventually) scrape a slender profit on the outlay required to deploy six systems, then even more eventually an even slimmer profit from ten. While most installs were expected to turn a profit within 24 months, it was not expected to return a profit from the TWENTY-SIX systems that ended up installed there for at least eight years - assuming that their monitoring fees were never altered in that period.\n\n---\n\nAbout three years passed; after a significant number of shenanigans with a Manager that literally spent eight hours a day staring out the window, the company was restructured; a Chief Executive to wield supreme executive power during the day to day running of the company was required!!!\n\nThe CEO we ended up with, however, was a special breed of person; he'd been made redundant from many positions, and just outright fired for incompetence from others. However, he had made a couple of friends, one of which was the top salesman of a company that happened to own about 30% of the voting shares in the company where I worked. As fate would have it, the CEO had also previously been employed as a manager by a different shareholder, who said - and this is a direct quote - \"I would never, EVER, give [the CEO] a job again.\" I'm guessing that he wasn't one of the references he used on his resume.  \nHowever, the salesman had turned the 30%+ shareholder to him, and the smaller shareholder (~12% of voting stock, as I recall) could neither dissuade his fellow Director, nor muster a large enough voting bloc to stop the appointment outright.\n\n---\n\nOn the CEO's first day, he asked \"So what's my title - Sales Manager?\" The man didn't even know he was the Chief Executive, despite other candidates (myself included) having applied for the advertised position - in writing, as stipulated in the advertisement, then interviewed, and only THEN told we had been passed over for to a \"more qualified candidate\".  \nSo clearly he had never even read the advertisement, let alone endured an intense two hour interview.\n\n---\n\nThe CEO attached himself (like a barnacle, or some other form of limpet) to a project that one of the contractors was working on - a major city council; almost two hundred buildings, each with no more than two systems to be monitored. Easy money.  \nAfter many many *many* trips away - with his wife, of course - to stand beside the contractor's salesman and say \"Yes\" and \"Uh huh\", the contract was eventually won. Having seen the people that worked on it, I award none of the credit to the CEO.\n\nHowever, this bloodied the nose of the company's major competition. They now had almost two hundred monitoring systems returned to them; gathering dust in their warehouse rather than collecting revenue.\n\nAs best I could tell, they took a jab back at us - and went to the education establishment from earlier. They offered them a monitoring price that was ridiculous; we would literally be losing money to provide the service at that price. From memory, the payment for an entire quarter was less than the currently paid each month.\n\nI happened to stumble into the conversation when the CEO was discussing it with the Accountant.\n\n&gt; CEO: I don't know.\n\n&gt; Accountant: We really, really can't afford to.\n\n&gt; Me: What's up?\n\n&gt; CEO: Oh, *{competitor}* has made a stupidly low offer to *{education establishment}* for monitoring.\n\n&gt; Me: What's the problem? Let them go; they've been nothing but a nuisance since day one.\n\nI should mention that - as well as the rotten cable issue - they blamed us for problems with their own equipment; when I proved that it was their equipment at fault, they tried to skip out on the engineer's bill for diagnostics - despite having previously agreed to pay it, if it turned out to be their issue. They also tried to blame us for unnecessarily messaging them, when it was actually a message from a completely unrelated system (warning them that someone was trying to access one of their buildings - seriously, kids, the library is NOT OPEN at 2 A.M.) which their own security team *had already told them* was not related to us. They also got hit by lightning at least four times, each time destroying several of our monitoring units - which were replaced, every time, at the company's cost.  \nDuring my tenure, precisely ZERO other sites were struck by lightning.\n\n&gt; Me: Let them go; wish them luck with their new provider; and if they ever come back to us, ~~laugh in their face~~ politely decline. They have always been more trouble than they are worth.\n\n&gt; CEO: Hmm. I'll think about it.\n\n---\n\nA few weeks later, the Accountant burst into my office.\n\n&gt; Accountant: OMG! I'm so mad!\n\n&gt; Me: What's up?\n\n&gt; Accountant: You remember that offer *{competitor}* made to *{education establishment}*?\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah - the one I said \"good riddance\" about? Oh God, don't tell me the CEO matched it, and now they're staying.\n\n&gt; Accountant: No. Worse.\n\n&gt; Me: How could it b- Wait, did he *beat* the offer? The one we would never make a profit on?\n\n&gt; Accountant: Yip.\n\n&gt; Me: FFFFFUUUUUUUUUU- So we're literally paying them for the privilege of providing their service?\n\n&gt; Accountant: Yip.\n\n&gt; Me: How bad?\n\n&gt; Accountant: Bad. We're basically getting paid a single regular month per quarter per monitoring unit.\n\n&gt; Me: But... What about all the extra systems? There's like, forty or fifty of them.\n\n&gt; Accountant: A dollar, each.\n\n&gt; Me: No. Per month, right?\n\n&gt; Accountant: Per quarter.\n\n&gt; Me: Are you sure?\n\n&gt; Accountant: That's what he told me.\n\n&gt; Me: You know what? Ask him to spell it out in an email, so you can copy and paste it directly into the invoicing system.\n\n&gt; Accountant: Why?\n\n&gt; Me: Just a feeling...\n\n---\n\nAnother couple of years passed. The CEO of the largest shareholder was making noises about retiring, and in a completely unsurprising move, had brought his son and daughter in to run various parts of the business. The daughter took to marketing briefly before deciding that working for Daddy was even more fun when she was on maternity leave. His son, however, showed a surprisingly large amount of common sense, and even occasionally business acumen.  \nAs the heir apparent to the largest single bloc of voting shares, he visited the company; I ended up in a meeting room with him, the CEO, and the Accountant.\n\n&gt; Son: Hey, so how's the *{education establishment}*?\n\nHis father's company also has a service contract with them; I believe that's why we ended up with the contract. Who you know sometimes works both ways.\n\n&gt; Me: They were nothing but trouble, back when we took them over... Rotten cables, signal issues, constant false alarms - not to mention them trying to blame us for faults on completely unrelated equipment.\n\nA deliciously evil plan had formed. I realized that the CEO never told me that he was matching/beating *{competitor}*'s price.\n\n&gt; Me: At least we don't look after them any more; *{competitor}* made them an offer we couldn't afford to match a year or so back.\n\n&gt; CEO: We still look after them - we were forced to match it.\n\n&gt; Son: Wait, what? How could they \"force\" you to match their offer? If it's a bad deal, then it's a bad deal - walk away, right?\n\nSee, there's that common sense I warned you about.\n\n&gt; CEO: Oh, well, because our equipment was already installed, we could exclude installation from the equation, and then I calculated we would still turn a slight profit at $X per month.\n\n&gt; Accountant: $X per quarter.\n\n&gt; CEO: What? No, $X per month; it should be $3X per quarter.\n\n&gt; Accountant: That's not what we're charging.\n\n&gt; CEO: Then you've clearly made a mistake! We'll need to go back over *years* of accounts to fix it!!!\n\n&gt; Accountant: Well, here's the email on my laptop, where you put in writing \"$X per quarter\". You can see here, where I replied and asked if you meant per month instead, and you responded and said \"No, that's right!\" If you recall, I tried to talk to you about it at the time, but you said that you'd done the calculations yourself, so they were definitely right. I did ask you several times to share the calculations with me so that I could double check them - like you always say, \"to trust is divine, but to double check is smart\"! But you never showed them to me. Look at this email, you can see where you wrote: \"It's right - just do it!\" So, after that email, I did - I set it up exactly as you'd asked, exactly as per these emails. So if anyone has made a mistake here, I don't believe it was me.\n\n&gt; CEO: Oh. Uh...\n\n&gt; CEO: Moving on...\n\nAt that moment, the shareholder's son caught my eye, and we shared, for a moment, a \"look\" - his look said *is this for real?* while mine said *welcome to my life.*\n\nI can only hope that once his father steps down, the son will not share his father's enthusiasm for the CEO, and someone competent might eventually be appointed.\n\n---\n\nNot that I'll ever find out: I quit that job last year, and took one that had far less responsibility spread among a far larger technical team, and an equivalent (arguably better) remuneration package.\n\nTo date, I have not missed working there; I have not missed working there at all.\n",

Apologies for any formatting issues or spelling, on my mobile.\n\nA bit about me: Female/22/6 months out of college, into job as administrator (which was college course)\n\nNow I've been in the job for a few months and I've been getting more duties handed to me, no problem, I was taught this stuff. I don't particularly have days off which wasn't a major issue when I had less to do, since it kinda balanced with my £200/week wage (terrible I know). Now things have been changing slowly but surely from what I agreed initially, the biggest being he asked that I use my mobile as the company number instead of his, okay fine.\n\nNow I've dealt with a lot of crap from this, I've missed wages and wrote it off since the company is broke as hell, been blamed for things since everyone (even the owner) don't want to own up to mistakes. \n\nThis week takes the cake. I've had emails upon emails from people demanding refunds, having things cancelled because they hadn't paid etc, and all the complaints go to me because it's my mobile number. I've been telling people over and over I can't give them refunds because I don't have authorisation. They demand to speak to my boss/owner who is out on business all week. I've been doing all his work this week because he's out, they've been pestering and abusing me because he isn't returning calls, he's telling me to tell them it'll be next week, they aren't happy, he's too busy to phone them and explain. And the circle keeps going round and round. \n\nNow in reality, they can't get their refunds because the money isn't there and now he wants to do it again. He wants to charge people for things this weekend even though its a strong possibility we need to cancel them, so we can pay refunds we owe, and have to get more money again to pay those ones. \n\nHe doesn't see an issue, thinks he's actually doing all the work and I'm ready to tear my hair out. I have trigger finger on my dominant hand but I cant have it dealt with since I'm the only office staff because it's a small company. He won't cover anything, he told me to push my phone number more because he's had too many calls the last few days. His number appears once and it isn't registered as his, the rest is mine so think of how many calls I've had.\n\nI have no idea what to do because when I try to talk to him he's too busy and stressed to do this, and I can't leave until I have a new job because I can't afford it! I'm stuck and I've never felt like crying more in my life. I'm scared to answer my personal mobile because of the calls.\n\n\nI'm sorry for the long assed rant guys but thanks for reading",

But. Y’all I cannot make any of this crap up, and it’s going to be disjoined as I try to sum up the ridiculousness.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: I work for an aerospace company. Sales, mostly. I actually LIKE my job, and most of the people I work with (MOST). I started as a temp answering the phones and working some with sales, and after three years, worked my way up. I bear no ill-will to anyone who answers phones; just THIS lady. OH MY GOD THIS LADY.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDA: Yeah, it's fitting, but it's her name, too. She's 45ish, and is That Dumb Co-Worker. All she needs to do is answer phones, be a gate keeper, and order supplies. And she does none of them well)  I have SO many stories about her, but I'll start with this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Exhibit the First: The Excel Sheet of Utter Confusion; total roll: 49. Babbles Incoherently.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a daily report, on an Excel sheet, that I was required to fill in every day, regarding daily sales – what came in to quote, and what went out as a quote, dollar amounts, so forth. The information comes from two different places: a log, also in Excel, and an ERP system. (Most of the incoming stuff is on the sheet, the outgoing is in the ERP system. It’s not even close to ideal but it is what it is right now.) The daily report is then sent to parent company in the Pacific NW.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’ve been short on time getting this sheet done (bc doing my job may be slightly more important than ONE MORE WAY to report matrix), or not here (like for my kiddo's bday) and the PNW peeps were not having it, so the GM asked me to train DA and at first I resisted, because I KNEW it was going to be an effort.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“ANewPerfume,” I can hear you say, “how can it be hard to teach someone to copy and paste information?” Y’all. THE STRUGGLE WAS REAL. The struggle was SO REAL that after SEVEN WORKING DAYS of sitting on top of her and saying, “no… copy from… yes, copy. Oh, you right click to copy too. Of course. Okay now paste that onto this sheet… nono, PASTE. You already copied. Oh, you pasted over the copy. Okay. Control+Z. What’s that do? Oh, it undoes… you can also use the arrow up top. Oh… no please don’t overwrite the data and sav…. Oh. Well. That’ll teach me to not make a backed up file of the backup.” SHE STILL DIDN’T HAVE IT, Y’ALL. Jesus take the wheel. Jesus take the wheel and drive me right to the nearest bar, and order me a double shot of tequila.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt that point I gave up on the idea of ever explaining our ERP system to her (we didn’t get that far; her boss asked after if I thought she was ready. “No. Not quite.” Which was meant to be, “she hasn’t even sharpened her crayon to fill in her character sheet yet; maybe we should take her away from the table and the game currently in process?”). Needless to say, I’ve still be doing that part, leaving her with the job of copying and pasting from three columns to another sheet. From how many rows, you ask? Depends on the day, but sometimes none, sometimes 15 or more. The columns match on both sheets; it’s just a more concise way of looking at certain parts of the data, or so I’ve been told. It may have been a trick of compliance.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn addition to this daily report, they’ve requested that we compile the last week’s data into a WEEKLY report. It’s legit just all the info, added up, into one report. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell. I made my first mistake here. I tried to HELP her. I know, I know; helping a stupid person is like hitting yourself in the face, or reaching into the oven without mitts, or reading the comment section in an anti-vax community. And it came back to haunt me in the same way, don’t worry.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn my extreme helpfulness, the first two weeks she did the weekly report, I sent her a copy of the MAIN report that Monday, so she could easily fill in the data requested. Thoughtful and helpful, I hear you say. I’m Mother frakking Teresa. It’s true. Until you realize this “MAIN REPORT” is just the SAME thing she was sending every day, but with each of the days on their own tab. (Monday’s report on a Monday’s tab with the date, Tuesday’s on its own, and so forth, with a weekly report tab in between, by date). So, you know the reason why my mailbox is close to its size limit; that damn ~ main sheet ~ is over 6 MBs and counting now. So why, you ask now, side-eyed, did I send her this main sheet if it was just a copy of the data that she sent it EVERY DAY?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR HER TO GET THE INFO FROM ONE SHEET, EVEN GOING BETWEEN TABS, THAN GOING BACK INTO HER SENT E-MAIL, AT LEAST WHILE SHE WAS LEARNING. AND BOY HOWDY, WAS I CORRECT. Because now? NOW is where the “babbling incoherently” comes in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne Monday, a Monday the 3rd of October to be exact, she was set to do the weekly log. I left, around 4, and went home because home has wine, and doesn’t have DA (you see, this particular Monday, I’d had to explain to her about shared Excel sheets, and how if I was on the sheet she needed, because I use it daily, she could other pull the data from read-only, or open the file, and click “Notify,” and it would flash at her, but she told me that was too confusing so I had to go drink. By the time I got home, I had four e-mails from her, explaining how she couldn’t do the reports. Because of me. So I informed her, again, I wasn’t on the logs, she could be, and poured myself a glass of wine. Another e-mail, this time telling me she couldn’t do the WEEKLY report because I didn’t send her the information she needed. Jesus never showed up to take the wheel, so he got a crap review from me on Uber, and I just sent her the information sheet because I’d just swallowed one glass of wine in a single sip, and that’s bad when you’re no longer 22. Came in the next day, and reminded her via e-mail that she was able to retrieve that information on her own.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis started a seriously THREE DAY SET OF E-MAILS. She was angry at me for not sending her the info, and what should she do if I ever failed to send it to her again, and how would she get this done onoes?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe apparently didn't understand my answer, \"just add up the last five reports\" because she PRINTED the Excel sheet, wrote on it, SCANNED IT IN, and e-mailed me \"BUT WHERE ARE THESE NUMBERS FROM\" and cc'ed her boss and my boss. Neither was amused by her cc'ing, either. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHer next e-mail after that was legit \"Where do I find the value????\" and well, that, my friends, was found RIGHT WHERE I SAID IT WAS. Y'all know what was confusing her?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe had to scroll down to see it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTWO DAYS OF E-MAILS AND SALTINESS AND IT ALL STEMMED FROM NOT SCROLLING DOWN ON A SHEET. NOT THAT SHE HAD TO SCROLL DOWN FAR OR MUCH OR AT ALL, BUT. WHAT.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is the information -I- was still having to fill out, because she couldn't have access to the ERP system, so she didn't remember it, I guess?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nScrolling is difficult.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTHIS HAPPENED THREE WEEKS AGO. She still refuses to talk to me, in a professional manner or otherwise. Until today. But more on that in a moment. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe's been doing the sheet on her own for three weeks, and, shocking to no one, still not getting it done correctly. Most mornings I come in and am blasted via e-mail from our parent company on why our numbers were low or over-blown or anything between.  Why? Because she couldn't scroll. :( \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo this Monday I gave up and said I'd do the report again, not enough time be damned. And maybe that's what DA wanted, who knows, but she's EXTRA SALTY I took it over, so who knows. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause her newest thing is, when I walk by, to huff and pound her tiny fist of rage against her desk in time with my heels. Because she, as she e-mailed me, said that I'm unprofessional in my heels when I walk by and don't I know people are on the phone? She informed me she enjoys whistling and singing at her desk, too. Which she's done non-stop since the e-mail.  MY FEET ARE JUST COUNTING OUT NUMBERS SO YOU CAN ADD, SO SORRY DA.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not even sure this is real life, at this point. Because how ?  She is exhausting. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Example Two: Geography is for People Who Care**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne of the guys from our PNW office was here last Thursday, and he mentioned the winds/storm incoming to WA state to DA. She goes, \"I HEARD about that, left over bits of Hurricane Matthew. So scary!\" Y'all, that pause from the guy was TANGIBLE. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Uh, no...\" the sheer willpower of this guy was pretty awesome; I GET IT.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Part the Third: E is for Existential Crisis: ARE you still there? And How Would You Know?**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was young when I realized “once you hear something, you can’t UN-hear it.” It usually was my brother J or I sniffling, driving my Grandpa around the bend until he’d shout “BLOW THAT THING.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few months ago, one of my co-workers asked me, “Have you heard how she picks up a call from hold?” \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo explain a little: we’re on the second floor of an open floor plan. You can whisper through your panties and someone on another floor in another room can hear it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut to answer his question: no, I hadn’t. But I’d listen and see. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* “[Name of Company], can I help you?” \n* [phone dude speaketh]\n* “Let me check, hold please!”&amp;nbsp;\n* [checks]\n* [picks phone back up – you know, by clicking on the blinking light that indicates someone is waiting on hold]\n* “Are you still there?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI mean… not the worst thing to ask, I guess. But I can’t un-hear it now, and it’s adding up. I mean, not egregious, but if they weren’t there, DA, the light wouldn’t blink, and you couldn’t pick up.\n\nI blame my co-worker for making me hear this, because it’s gotten to nails on the chalkboard point. \n\nI hear it several times an hour now - in all sorts of inflictions. “ARE YOU STILL THERE?”\n\n“Are YOU still there?”\n\n“Are you STILL there?”\n\n“Are you still THERE????”\n\nI sort of wish someone would answer, “no, sorry!” just to see what would happen. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo. About three weeks ago, a gentleman came in to the front office, and asked for an employee. She asked the guy if he had an appointment, he didn’t, so she went to see if the employee wanted to see this sales guy. He didn’t either. She comes back after going to employee’s office, looks directly at the guy, and goes…\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGo ahead, you guys. GUESS WHAT SHE ASKED HIM.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“ARE YOU STILL THERE?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWHILE LOOKING IN HIM IN THE EYE. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSTANDING THREE FEET AWAY FROM HIM.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSpeaking of tangible pauses, I felt so bad for the guy. I laughed so hard, and I wasn’t the only one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n** Killer TimeClock from Outer Space.** \nHourly employees, of which DA is one, are required to use software on their computer (I added it to hers for ease, figured it was easier than teaching her to use one of the computers out on the floor) for clocking in, out, and for lunch. It requires you to OPEN the program, TYPE IN your employee number (4 characters), then click the “IN” button.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know. Complicated AF, amirite? It’s amazing, given that level of complexity, that anyone is able to sign in or out ever. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’ve heard her ask the HR guy a few times to adjust her time back in from lunch because she “forgot” to log in, or because she “messed it up.” Well, last week HR was out of town, so my understanding is she e-mailed AR, who was covering some of HR’s duties, because the next thing I know, I hear this conversation: \n\n* AR: calls DA\n* DA: HIIIII MY LOOOOOVE!\n* AR: What, exactly, happened?\n* DA: WELL, I came back in from lunch, and put my number in\n* AR: [pause]\n* DA: [pause]\n* AR: [pause…?]\n* DA: Yeah?\n* AR: Yes? And then?\n* DA: OH! I guess I forgot!\n* AR: you forgot what happened next?\n* DA: AHhahahhaSILLY. No, I forgot how many times I pushed the button. So I clocked in, then clocked out right away again!\n* AR: Okay, so I need you to log back in \n* DA: BUT I TRIED\n* AR: I mean right now, please.\n* DA: I can’t! I didn’t!\n* AR: Can you open the program?\n* DA: Yes\n* AR: Do that.\n* DA: Okay.\n* AR: enter your number.\n* DA: okay…\n* AR: Click log in.\n* DA: NO.\n* AR: No???\n* DA: I can’t\n* AR: Could you please just log in for me so I can adjust your time?\n* DA: I can’t!\n* AR: WHY NOT\n* DA: I’m too afraid to! \n* AR: …pleaselogin\n* DA: I’ll mess it up!\n* AR: It is already messed up.\n* DA: … I’ll ask [HR] to fix it next week\n\n\nI cannot wait to drink tonight, you guys. She's been here since March, and NOTHING is getting better. AT ALL. I don't get how she is still here. (I DO, actually; we're really bad about holding people accountable here, but COME. ON.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI may be drunk before the debate starts tonight. ",

        "text": "I used to be a temp receptionist in a very small sales office. \n\nThere was this one guy who was... well, he was a total ass.  (And this is unrelated, but I used to leave for lunch when I saw him go into the one unisex bathroom we had because this mans colon seemed to weaponize his breakfast every day around 11am.)\n\nAs an example, he had been told over and over not to touch the air conditioning controls, yet every day he would set it so cold that my hands went numb.  When the landlord walked into that office and felt how cold it was in there one day, she had a maintenance man in there moving the vent within 10 minutes.  I still love that woman for that. \n\nAnyway, one of his more irritating traits was that he was condescending as hell.  One of the other sales guys used to call him \"Rick with the silent P.\"  Rick was not well liked, but I was, so I had a little bit of leeway.  Not a lot, but basically, if I told him off, everyone would understand because pretty much the whole office had told him off at one point or another.\n\nSo one day, when no one else was in the office, he asked me something about a phone message.  I had put it in his little mail box as was protocol, and as I recall, he had been upset that I hadn't told him that there was a message in his box.  He asked how he was supposed to know there was a message in there, I was goofing around, and I said \"I should think that would be obvious.\"  Clearly, it was a kind of obnoxious answer, but I really was just kidding.  Obviously, he should know because, when he checked his little mail box, there was a message in it.  As I recall, I had heard the phrase on a tv show or something and it seemed to fit.  I wasn't trying to be an ass, and I genuinely thought he'd figure it out.\n\n\"Well it's not,\" said Rick with the Silent P.\n\nI explained that he would know about the message when he checked his mailbox, and he flipped his shit:\n\n\"WHAT is your PROBLEM?\"\n\nWell, now I snapped.  This guy was frequently a jerk and I'd had enough.\n\n\"My problem is that you are condescending.\"\n\n\"Condescending?  What does that mean?\"\n\nKeep in mind, I'm pissed now.  So I grab a dictionary off of the shelf (hey, this was like 20 years ago) and hand it to him.  \"Look it up,\" I say.\n\nHe fumbles around for a few seconds, slams the book closed, and says - I'm dead serious - \"I don't have to take this from *you*!  You're just a damned *temp!*\"\n\n\"And *that,*\" I say, \"is condescending.\"\n\nAt some point, he threatened to call my supervisor at the agency, and I offered to dial the phone for him.  He stormed out.  I called them myself and told them what had happened, and later when the office supervisor came in, I told him what had happened, too.  I don't know what was said, but Rick with a Silent P did apologize to me once he and the office supervisor discussed things.\n\nAs an aside, once I left that temp job, Rick with a Silent P called and asked me out.  WTF???  I did not return that call.",

All communication between client and constructor goes through us.\n\n**Part 1:**\nIn this case, the house is finished, and the client (Norwegian) informed us on a Monday  that he will be in Spain on Sunday, and wants all appointments set up so they can move into the house.  \nHe initially wanted the buy the house by *usufruct*, ie he buys the place in his son's name, but he gets to enjoy the house. (to do this, they both have to pay a different tax rate on the property, so it's important we know what they want)  \nCommonly done to later escape inheritance tax (quite high here, inheritance is a pain in the ass to get the procedures done as a foreigner).\n\nOf course, that would mean, his son will have to come as well, but he is working. So they decide to just buy it normally.\n\nColleagues start setting up all appointments, they have everything confirmed by Thursday to get it all done on Monday, and the notary appointment on Tuesday.  \nMy colleague informs the client by email, and gets a phone call a few minutes later: \"Yeah, we're arriving on Sunday, so we don't want to do things on Monday, as we'll be too tired.\" He arrives Sunday *morning*, it's only a 3-4 hour flight.  \n\"I'll call you on Monday, see when we can arrange stuff.\"\n\n**Part 2:**  \nClient arrived on Sunday, called my colleague on Monday: \"Yeah, so we could this this week, maybe?\"  \n*coworker sounding all sweet-like*: \"I'm sorry, this week is totally booked full, that is why we wanted to do it today. But we could, oh...., do it next week Wednesday\".  \n\"Yeah, okay....oh, and we want to buy with usufruct, bye\" *click*\n\nWe decided to just have his \"legal representative\" (we recommend our own lawyer to our clients. \"Client-Attorney privilege\" is not a word in our companies' dictionary) contact them to explain they can't buy with usufruct as their son isn't here.  \nThat conversation has been going since Monday last week, he still doesn't understand.",

Bette is in need of some leave so that's why I'm there. \n\nFirst day, no computer, no logons, Bette needs her space to get her stuff finished, so I get to sit and watch Glenda do her stuff, thats fine, your paying, happy to sit here and watch. Get a little bit of adhoc training, but it will do, Glenda watches me do the job. I generally pick up processes fairly quick, I have no issues picking up their processes all is good. \n\nFirst week finished and this is what I've discovered, Bette has been their too long and is bitter. Glenda is something else. As soon as Bette is out of the way, Glenda can't wait to tell me how annoying Bette can be, how she interferes with her job yada yada yada. Tells me they are understaffed and they need another person (ok, I can deal with that). \n\nFurther conversations with Glenda go along like this:-\n\n*She either wants to have Bette to leave or be sacked, just wants to get rid of her.\n\n*Wants to increase the team to at least three, maybe more\n\n*Wants to appoint herself as team leader, once she has Bette out of the way.\n\n*Would like me to join the team, but only do as I am told, she would be team leader.\n\n*As I'm temping, I ask lots of questions, to ensure I keep consistencies with current processes, happen to pick up some errors of Glenda's, not biggies, just small shit, not trying to pick these up, again, trying to make sure I'm doing it right. My reputation as a temp get me bigger and better jobs so I like to do good work. Glenda gets edgy, I think she thinks I am becoming a bit threatening. \n\nI don't think that this is the place for me. I would hate to think what it would be like to work under someone like Glenda, no doubt she is very big on pushing her own agenda, and I think she was wanting me to help. Bet she would turn in a instant to make herself look better. \n\nAlso took until day three to get log-ins etc, happy that they were paying me for the first two days to sit around and watch. ",

I held this job for a total of three years. During this time, I was given incrementally more responsibility and I felt like I was getting groomed for position of Assistant Director, which for you laymens, is the one who basically keeps the wheels moving on set. They make the schedule and make sure its followed and a bunch of other supervisory things. \n\nI had the support of a few directors and producers for the position, but when a spot finally opened up, they gave it to someone else. I was a little miffed, but the guy I had lost it to had been at the company about as long as I had, so I figured I was next up. But a few months later, I was passed up again, and not only that, they gave it to someone from outside the company. Let's call him Josh. \n\nJosh was a pretty nice guy, but I couldn't help resent the fact they spent months training him to do things that I already knew how to do. Finally, I just decided to leave. I was getting bored of the show anyway. I gave my notice and left a couple weeks later. \n\nI took a month off and then starting sending out resumes. But not long after, the company called me and asked if I was interested in coming back as a producer. This was a huge step up, way better than the job that I had wanted originally. I agreed and started a month ago. \n\nIt seems that in my absence, Josh had decided he didn't like the AD job and changed departments. He bounced around a bit, but now he has my old job, directly as my subordinate. \n\nI'm feeling pretty good about things. Like I said, Josh was a nice guy, so I didn't hold him any ill will, but I just have this feeling like the universe is as it should be. \n\ntl:dr I was passed up for a promotion, so I quit, got hired back at a job higher than the person who was given the promotion instead of me. \n",

I am a strong worker as I've been there for about 2 years now. Being that this job is sales, there are good days and there are the not so good days which involve either making sales back to back or otherwise you're practically looking for water in the Sahara. \n\n            My boss is a great girl and doesn't have any problems with me as I have proven that people either want to buy your product or they don't. There's a 99.9 percent chance that you can't win over a customer if they cut you off before you even say hello and your first pitch to them. That  .1 percent left over is only for the elderly who are retired for some reason. Either way, I've had my fair share of every kind of guy and gal who doesn't want to hear about some washed up local press company. \n\n             I love this job too, don't get me wrong. But these God damn assistant managers have no fucking clue what the hell they're doing. Both of which are complete cliches. \n\n1. Jake- bald. Really cocky attitude. \"My way or the highway\" kinda guy. He's my least favorite\n\n2. Ally- COMES IN AT 8 IN THE FUCKING MORNING, SHOUTING ABOUT HOW GREAT WERE GONNA DO ON SALES, WOAH, WHAT A FUCKIN CARNIVAL THIS SHIT HOLE IS! Yeah, you probably get it. \n\n              The other day, I'm not doing so well on sales. So you know the whole shappeal, ally calls me in her office to review what's going on. I'm following company policy by pitching all 3 times and especially changing personas, as stagnation is suicide in this job. So obviously, it's not me. A lot of people coincidentally don't want the paper right now. That's OK for her. \n\n             About an hour later, Jake calls me in the same office for the same review with the same results except this time he tells me everything I'm doing is wrong. So I explained the previous review I had with ally and he told me I was lying. I looked him and right in the face and said \"stop wasting my time, and let me do my job.\" \n\n             I tell you what, to be able to say that felt great. Felt like I had some say over what was really happening that day. Still me favorite job I've ever had and I will continue to do this job cause the occasional 10 minute long talk about someones previous problems with the paper is so rewarding. Especially when I fix all that customers problems and get that paper going to them again. ",

That several people are unhappy with the changes in their roles recently. And that I'm somehow taking the brunt of it. \n\nI asked her what I could do - it's really important to me to have positive relationships with my coworkers - not just for me - but for the good of the company. I shared what I immediately thought I might be able to do (build 1:1 relationships, find out what mattered to people; how I could support them; get more flexible about how things get done). She liked all these suggestions, and then named 2 key people I should focus on as the office influencers.\n\nSo...now what? \n\nI did request that she send a letter to the company about the changes she's made, her vision for the business unit I now lead, why she assigned me the role.\n\nShe said she’d work on it over the weekend.\n\nHere's what I know about myself that might cause people to have this perception of me: \n1) I can be overly self-reliant / I hate asking for help\n2) I speak in a straightforward tone\n3) I don't use upspeak or apologetic tones\n4) I have been told in other settings that people find me intimidating (the way I carry myself, how articulate I am, how pretty I am, how skinny I am.)\n5) I've worked for myself for the last 7 years and run my own business.

She works mornings here and I work evenings. I've been here about 3 months. In that time, I've learned so much about her life. For instance:\n\n- Her son is addicted to meth; he's had his children taken away for smoking around them but she thinks the police are framing him and have a conspiracy to take him down (she never explains why she thinks they're out to get him specifically).\n\n- A few weeks ago, her internet went out, and when they came to fix it, it took them a few days to rewire the job her kids had done on the house. She thinks they were planting surveillance bugs so now she doesn't speak when she's at home. She writes everything on notepads.\n\n- The people who live with her are very messy and don't clean up, never empty the litter box. She threw all her son's clothes on her carport on a pile of oil and lit them on fire (under a covered carport). When the cat litter doesn't get emptied, she pours it in their beds. They then throw away all the linens, so there are no linens on the beds at her home.\n\n- Her husband doesn't allow her to have male friends, even though one of her friends has \"the biggest dick [she's] ever seen.\" She hasn't had sex with her husband in a year.\n\n- She owns a cleaning business that she does in the evenings, and one of her clients is a local doctor's practice. She has a weird obsession with how much they poop and how disgusting it is, and every day that she comes in after cleaning their offices she describes the poops in detail and how she cleaned them, before speculating on what they must be eating.\n\n- When the folks who live with her didn't clean the kitchen, she took the sprayer on the sink and sprayed everything down with water, causing mold to start growing under her linoleum and her cabinets to be ruined. \"It's their problem now.\"\n\n- She drives an old POS muscle car that's bright yellow and smokes a pack a day. If she runs out of smokes at work, she will ask our clients if they have any she can bum.\n\n- She's a father's rights advocate and hates women; she thinks we are all slutty thieves who get pregnant just to extort the men in their lives. \"If my son is ever homeless, I'll give him money. If my daughter is, she will be fine, she can spread her legs and find a place to sleep.\"\n\n- She tried to get me in touch with one of her stripper friends for a side job because I've \"got the rack for that kind of work.\"\n\n- We are a divorce/family law firm; she gives some of our clients her cell phone number. One in particular got locked up for stalking his wife and she has taken an insane personal interest in his life. She visits him in jail, and is committed to helping him \"escape to Mexico\" when he gets bonded out because \"he ain't got no chance with that bitch of a wife of his.\"",

        "text": "Where I work, we have a lot of student workers. Most of them are wonderful people whom you hope will learn a lot from working with us and hopefully go on and do wonderful things with their futures.\n\nA few need a little more lessons about life, in general.\n\nWe had a Secret Santa at work (I despise these things!). I don't know whose brilliant idea it was, but we included student workers to participate.  My personal opinion is that the student workers should've been given gift cards. Let us full-time workers do the gift exchange since we know each other better. Plus, we FT workers are stuck with each other when the students are on break, stop working when their semester ends, get other internships, etc.\n\nNope. We had to get stuff for people we hardly know and they probably felt the same about some of us.\n\nHaving been a student worker myself, I went through a Secret Santa in which a student calls out and the FT worker who was supposed to get a gift never does. \n\nYou know where this is going.\n\nDay of the exchange rolls around and several students called out sick. \n\n2 FT workers didn't get gifts. One of them was me.\n\nI'm okay with not getting something. I'm too grumpy to be a holiday person. Plus, I never wanted to participate in this. Thankfully, my Secret Santa was another full-time worker. My coworker who also didn't get a gift -- she loves the holidays. She happily decorated the office and even wore an elf suit to work. I could tell she was fuming when she was left with nothing.\n\nSo, I'm knitting her a scarf as a belated present. I hope it's not pouring salt into her wounds or dredging up something she'd rather forget. I know that next year, I'm opting out of the exchange altogether.\n\n[Haven't figured out if I'll be petty enough to present it to her within earshot of the student workers, if any of them come back for the next term.]",

        "text": "**Backstory:** So my office has been growing lately. We have serial entrepreneurs as owners and they build up companies and then sell them, but there's always one company underneath that remains as to always have income and jobs for everyone.\n\nMost people here are not very tech savvy. Everyone only knows how to do what they are supposed to do and to teach anything new is a challenge. When I started working here with literally next to no experience, I basically changed the entire workflow in the office as I gained experience in Excel. When I started working on Macros, I felt like a god among peons. They didn't even get the concept of it.\n\nFast forward a couple months. We've started a new company and I've been put in a new position creating output files from our system. I get six hours of formal training and then I'm expected to know everything. They hire someone to work on 'efficiency in the company' (I'll call Captain Awesome) who is literally the worst person on staff. I had them hire a friend whose job experience was Fast Food Clerk and they're is probably one of the best in the office now. They view him as shit and Captain Awesome as amazing just based on prior work experience. Its absurd. Captain Awesome is extremely slow and inefficient and probably doesn't even deserve a basic position let alone to be in charge of efficiency of tasks they cant even complete.\n\n**Here's where I lose my mind:** There was a mistake made yesterday. It was a silly small mistake but for a large client who we've made mistakes for in the past. Its going to cause an inconvenience for ~250 people. Someone might get fired over it. This is insane. There are over 400 clients and only three people functional in my old department. Every client gets basically the same amount of time dedicated to them whether they are 12 people or 5000 people. We don't have enough employees to dedicate to necessary amount of time to the tasks for the larger clients. \n\nI find out that even though I have this new job - the owners think it's not taking up enough time and I should still ALSO be doing my old job. (They're right in a sense, but I need more than 6 months experience for it to be true. It is also year-end. The craziest time of year in my industry). Captain Awesome, on the other hand, is also supposed to be part of the department. Captain Awesome literally does nothing for them but my bosses claim they're the best so they're taken off of everything to basically do nothing that will EVER be of use. \n\nNow my friend is probably in deep shit. A company sent us a file with a comma where there normally isn't a comma. That's what happened. We get the file once every 3 months, only get about 20 minutes to work on it because of the quantity of work going on, and someone might get fired over it. \n\nThe owners have no idea what it takes to run this place. They sit in their offices and take upper level calls and sell as much product as they possibly can. They don't hire anyone to cover the influx of clients and expect this place to run without error.\n\n**The saving grace:** I have to admit. The owners are nice guys. They're ambitious guys. They do a lot for us and its why I don't want to leave. They just need to open their eyes and ears.\n\n*If they fire literally ANYONE in my 'old' department, there is no way we will get everything done. I heard through the grape vine that their genius plan is to give me the full responsibility for our top 10 largest clients while still learning my new job. My direct supervisor works 60+ hours a week. I will not do this. I will not be a slave to them. I have a family. I already put in overtime. I will not live here*\n\n\n\n**Sorry for the rant - not even sure this belongs here.**\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n**Update: It turns out the client doesn't care about this particular issue so we dodged a bullet. Everyone is safe. The rest of the complaints remain valid**",

        "text": "I work at a really stupid desk job (because I don't like desk jobs really) which is good for those who want a sense of security and some more knowledge in their career. \n\nSo we have this really odd/weird/annoying woman in the office who really really blows everyone's minds in a very bad way. \n\nA few annoying incidences-\n\n1. The least face-palm one:\n\nWe were doing this secret Santa thing and everybody was gifting everyone something. I highly believe woman didn't understand what Secret Santa is, plus she could have cared to ask- but no. \n\nSo while everyone were finding gifts on their desks, one of the people on the floor found a gift wrapped (later got to know it had a pop up Santa on it) card on his desk. Now cards are obviously evident because the card was gift wrapped flat thing!\n\nHe opened it and there, the name was written on the card. Everybody facepalmed so hard that they don't want to include her in the next Secret Santa. \n\n2. My personal annoying incident:\n\nSo I was working on Christmas day and there wasn't much work really so I went and sat by a colleague's desk chatting. Ours is an open office where people from different teams sit. \n\nSo as I a talk to him, this woman suddenly appears out of nowhere and she holds my face in her hands, cupping my cheeks (mind you, I hardly talk to her) in her palms and says-\n&gt;joeesomething right, what are you even doing in this section \n\nMy colleague and I stare at her and then the colleague explains how there is no much work in my team so I am there \n\nAnd then she says \"Oh there is no work in your team? You must still work\". \n\nDamn you bitch :/\n\n3. Mistakes and mistakes:\n\nThis woman talks a lit and she is pretty loud. As I said, we are all an open office, she keeps talking and never ends. She was transferred into another team recently and her trainer/my colleague was working expecting her to observe how should she work but she went on talking about how she was in her previous team and how she us happy to be here and stuff. \n\nMy colleague made a mistake that day on the job as she kept jabbering. \n\nThe woman gets a scolding once in a week from her manager about how she hasn't reported many things (we make a weekly excel sheet) and she stays stubborn AF in denial. \n\nNeedless to say, her current team manager is having a hell of a time with excel sheets. \n\n4. The chief introducer:\n\nWhen she meets you, she will want to know everything about you like the other day the new joiner was introduced to me (I was passing her desk) as 'Hey joeesomething this is this XYZ person. He is from &lt;insert hometown&gt;, &lt;where does he/she stay in the city&gt;, etc. \n\nLike everyone in the office wants to know that. :/\n\nThe reason I am posting this is because everyone in office hates her, nobody wants her around, everyone just shoos her away and still she will get to you and will want to learn about everything personal. That is not how you do it at then workplace, you annoying lady.",
