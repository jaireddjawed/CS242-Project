It's the same as in English, using the negative of a verb in a question.  \"Why don't we eat?\", for example.\n\nMy question is, where did this use of a negative phrase to imply suggesting something, as opposed to literally asking why we're not eating, come from?  It seems like a very nuanced concept, yet it's present in English and the normal Romance languages, along with Japanese.  Two languages which were very separated in their development. Perhaps other disparate languages too.\n\nSo... any thoughts?  It just seems weird to me that that setup happens to be present in both.

After all, they always happen before \"now\", thus are \"past\", and they are largely a single chunk of time, \"Perfective\".\n\nMost textbooks refer to the ます / る・う verbs, い form of い-Adjectives, and non-past copulas as \"Imperfectives\".\n\nThis is linguistically incorrect, as \"Imperfectives\" in linguistics expand verb into a \"stream\" of time. For example, \"I had been eating for 3 hours\" is an Imperfective\", but is past tense.\n\nThat is, linguistically, \"perfectives\" are a type of \"aspect\", whereby the た forms are much more about \"tenses\". \n\nIs this just a relic, and Japanese textbook writers are simply ignoring linguistics?\n\nOr, am I missing something?\n\n*Edit* It seems that \"past perfective\" and \"non-past perfective\" would be good labels (if we ignore for a short period the ている forms of verbs).",

Look at it and review it and quiz yourself until it sticks. But remembering the character when trying to write it can be a pain. What I've found to work really well is reviewing the characters you're learning, then get a pencil and paper, then write the characters that you want, switch to a different set of characters and try them without review, then switch back. For example, I'm learning hiragana k, s and t at the moment. Writing the k's over and over is easy because you just did it. Switching from k and s each time (or whichever you're learning) will basically switch gears in your brain. Do this until you can remember how to write and identify them very easily and instantly. Once you get more experienced, you'll find that ones you've learned in the past are second nature, just like our English alphabet! Hope I helped someone out there! :)",

LingQ allows me to keep everything in one place so I can read the transcripts while following along the anime. Also, I can highlight words and save them for review (LingQ pulls translation from Google and other dictionaries automatically).\n\nI've also created lessons out of subtitles from Japanese dramas, movies, and so on and so forth.\n\nI've written a [post](https://www.lingq.com/blog/2018/09/05/anime-subtitles/) about the process here (p.s.

A sentence like\n\nかわいい \"it is cute\" is a complete sentence, it has an い adjective which is basically a verb. \n\nA sentence like \n\nきれい is not a complete sentence, because this な adjective is basically a noun (called an adjectival noun in grammars/wikipedia), the sentence has no verb... so you'd need a copula to say\n\nきれいです \"it is beautiful\" \n\nI can't believe it took me so long to figure this out. It's why sentence patterns with な adjectives need helper words or particles like だ or に. This means I can reorient my learning and cut down on categories to memorize. I'm not a linguist by any means and I'm probably really simplifying things, but I found figuring this out to be really helpful. Figured I'd share. \n\nedit: added a parinthesis I didn't close",
