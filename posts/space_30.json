I would describe it as a universal adventure investigating our collective knowledge and imagination regarding stars.  \nSo, I want to ask all of your help by suggesting me some more literature about stars I might want to look into for further research. I'm interested in all sorts of things, purely scientific and completely esoteric alike. I'm not too smart of a reader, I'd say Carl Sagan hits the perfect spot for me. So - could you provide me with suggestions of books, articles, journals, stories, forums, podcasts, films, etc. regarding:\n\nAmateur stargazing, telescopes and home made telescopes, star-gazer communities and what they are like;\n\nAstronomy in general, observatories in Hawaii, Chile, New Zealand and other places and how observatories work, what kind of work takes place there;\n\nStar constellations, origins, reading the sky, stars as guides in people's lives;\n\nAstrology, zodiacs and fortune telling based on stars;\n\nAncient and classical religions (parts) based on stars and night-sky;\n\nAncient myths and legends regarding stars;\n\nAncient pyramids and structures as observatories;\n\nEccentric people who tell tales of them being from distant stars (like Annunaki and that kind of stuff);\n\nPhysics and quantum physics relating to stars;\n\nMilky way and our own galaxy, what do we know about it and the most important things we don't know yet;\n\nEveryday light pollution and the effect it has on how we think, as well as the importance of being able to see and observe the night sky as we go about our lives;\n\nAnd anything I missed that you think should be worth it!;  \n\n\nTHANKS Y'ALL!",

        "text": "The Moon is a great place for our first steps outside Earth, building a base would be an amazing and exciting scientific experience for any future astronaut, who manage to pass the extremely selective pressure from NASA's training regiment.\n\nOur satellite could provide us with a miriad of benefits, iron, helium-3, aluminium, uranium, titanium, and a lot of minerals, furthermore its pity weak gravity in addition to the almost absence of atmosphere could help future generations to lift off exponentially easier + enable more esoteric methods of reaching orbit, such as mass drivers and even the infamous space elevators.\n\nHowever such an array of benefits couldn't reach without some sort of drawbacks, the Moon is energy-low, without fossil fuels, oxygen and coal, and top it off it lacks amy sort of atmosphere and oceans, thus making it unable to generate electricity without nuclear or solar.\n\nAnd to make it even harder, the Moon is in sync with Earth, so it takes a whole month for it to complete an orbit around the Earth. So one can't generate a decent amount of energy for more than half a month, even with thousands of solar panels. All useless.\n\nWhat if someone put a geosynched mirror in orbit, in order to reflect the sunlight directly into the solar panels? Would that be a good idea? I mean, since WW2 the nazis already invisioned such a project, the super-dumb \"sungun\", but instead of a weapon of mass destruction, it'd be an energy source. Is this idea more viable for a future Lunar Base than let's say, a nuclear reactor?\n\nThe mirror could be produced from the Moon's materials.",

The hypothetical aliens have decided to make contact peacefully, this is not a prelude to invasion or whatever. This is \"hello, you are not alone\"  \n\n\n\\#3. The hypothetical aliens are close by, whether thats via some kind of FTL technology, or because they're ship is passing close enough to us to talk I will leave up to you.  \n\n\n\\#4. You are in charge of the hypothetical aliens. Putting this here to head off the \"well they would be aliens so we cant possible know how their minds would work and blah blah blah\" I know, I get it, that's why this is a hypothetical. If you need to fill in more details, you do it. The question is how would you, if you were this hypothetical alien race, make contact with Earth, now, assuming all you have to go on is what these aliens would have from orbit, so our radio signals, images of earth, ect, anything they would have access too.  \n\n\n\\#5. These hypothetical aliens are technologically advanced enough to get here, just keep that in mind.  \n\n\nSo with all that being said, how would you make contact with Earth?",

As the spacecraft sped low over the giant planet's cloud tops, its JunoCam instrument captured this look at two of Jupiter's largest moons.\n\nIn the foreground, hurricane-like spiral wind patterns called vortices can be seen spinning in the planet's north polar region. These powerful storms can be over 30 miles (50 kilometers) in height and hundreds of miles across.\n\nBelow Jupiter's curving horizon, two Jovian moons make an appearance: Callisto (below) and Io (above).\n\nIn this view, north is down. At the time the image was taken, Juno was about 8,700 miles (14,000 kilometers) above Jupiter's cloud tops, at a latitude of about 69 degrees, traveling at a speed of about 123,000 mph (198,000 kilometers per hour) relative to the planet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/936o0sb9cqia1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60ad4ba0055c98a2dc17fb95d75979dbf14f85c4",

I hadn’t until the other day when I was looking up stuff on Apollo 14, 15, etc., and found his videos.  Here’s the one he did about Apollo 11… https://youtu.be/3zhBLZpBDDw\n\nThey are so well done and should be in the Smithsonian or on TV at least!  I’m on the documentary he did about Apollo 9 right now.  You all should check them out!",
