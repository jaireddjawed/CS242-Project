        "text": "So I'm in a networking class and I'm a little lost about IP addresses. Specifically Public vs. Private and subnet masks. So correct me if I'm wrong, but my basic understanding is that every LAN has at least one public IP or gateway IP that is usually for the router. Then there are Private IP's that only the router can see for all the PC's on the LAN. And the subnet mask determines what part of the IP is the network ID and what is the local computer IP. So hypothetically if my router's IP is like 92.168.5.0 and my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then my computer's ip should be something like 92.168.5.1. That's my understanding so far. However, when I try to observe this  in real life it doesnt work. \n\n(IP Addresses changed in this situation for privacy)\n\nWhen I do ipconfig, it says my ip is 92.168.5.100 (not really, but something along those lines). And because my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, I would assume my gateway is 92.168.5.0, or something pretty close to that. However, when I look up my IP online, the servers should be reporting my gateway IP, which should be 92.168.5.0. But they say something COMPLETELY different. What the heck??",

        "text": "So, first off I'd like to mention my introduction to games has been through say, logic games like EF ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé_game) and its variants. Unfortunately, I still don't have a very good understanding over how I'd modify the basic framework of the game to talk abut inexpressibility in modified logics. Anyways, I'm not going to talk about that.\n\nSo, I want to branch out and further explore other aspects of Game Theory and like assistance from experts or at least people who have some form of knowledge on these things.\n\n1. What is the current work going on with regards to the old game theory, the one started off by Nash, Neumann ?\n\n2.  What are the computational aspects to them? I heard a lot about complexity classes related to finding Nash Equilibrium of certain games. I want to know what is going on, on that front!\n\n3. The other kind of research I saw was of Demaine's objective of specifically giving the complexity class of known games. This sounds really interesting, and I think there was a recent paper on solvability of rubic cube being NP complete, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n4. Lastly, taking cue from the previous point, I'd want to know what kind of things are studied in combinatorial game theory and to what  aspects of CS do they affect. \n\nAny answer on these points will be highly appreciated. Thank you.",

I believe that part of the reason there are so few women in STEM is because girls tend to be presented with stereotyped version of what a STEM professional looks like (white, male, a genius, introverted, a little crazy) and what they do (something involving isolation, ridiculous hours, white lab coats and the odd explosion) by the media. This picture looks nothing like them or what they want in a career, discouraging them from pursuing STEM. To debunk this idea, and prove how diverse the field is, I am interviewing a variety of (mainly female) STEM professionals.\n\nI am publishing the interviews in my school's science journal and am building my own website to share these interviews with a wider audience.

Select the interval, x, with the earliest finishing time.\n2. Remove x, and all intervals intersecting x, from the set of candidate intervals.\n3.

Each time period represent a job for a bus, they start and end at the same place. He want to assign all of the time periods with as few buses as possible.\n__________\nI'm thinking that this can be done by repeatedly applying the scheduling algorithm for one bus at a time. The first bus will get the optimal amount of active time from the original set, the second bus will get the optimal amount of active time from the time periods that are left, etc.\n\nA theory part that I'm a tiny bit insecure regarding is: Will this result in the optimal solution for my friends problem?",

The \"decision\" algorithm would answer Yes/No and the \"constructive\" algorithm either outputs a perfect matching or a subset A' of A whose neighbourhood is smaller than the set itself (Hall's theorem).\n\nMy question is, how do call these \"deciding\"/\"constructing\" algorithms in computer science?\n\nEdit: Maybe I found it already. Wikipedia calls the related problems [Decision Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem) and [Search Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_problem). However in the later case, the output is either a positive certificate or just \"No\". (Which makes sense, since some problems do not admit negative certificates.)

First example talks about the \"worst-case running time\" of the program, while the Second example talks about the \"worst-case cost\" of the program. Are they two different methods of evaluating a program ?? Can \"running time\" and \"cost\" be used interchangeably ??

My current subjects are History, Philosophy and English Lit - in hindsight probably not the best subjects for a worthwhile degree but oh well.\n\nThe original plan was to do History at Uni but after some research I was put off. After looking around for something worth doing I came across computer science. I started a free course on CS just to see what it was like and it is actually pretty enjoyable and interesting. I'm now seeing history as something more to do in my spare time, and perhaps a degree in technology would be more useful. After a lot of research it looked promising. Of course I wouldn't get into any top Unis but could be better than a humanities degree. I also had a look at information technology which looks cool.\n\nSo I guess the question is would I be able to survive a CS course or should I stick to my original plan? I did computing at GCSE also so I'm not entirely out of the loop but still a bit unsure. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

Thus it seems useless to run simultaneously 7 or 8 VMs at any given time.\n\nHow possible is it to have this central tower dynamically generate VMs that would provide the appropriate resources for running the device that requests access to resources, light usage for the little raspberry pi playing your tunes in the bathroom or drawing more CPU and GPU power for your gaming sessions on the desktop PC or on the TV? \n\nWhat would be the obstacles, limitations or the strengths of such a configuration compared to dedicated units for each devices, or running continuous VMs for each device?\n\nI apologize in advance for any spelling errors or grammatical weirdness as English is merely my second (or third) language.",

        "text": "About me: My day job is working for a big, well known tech company as a software engineer and have ran 127+ coding and system design interviews for my company. As a way to try to make some side income I've tried some random stuff out including being a mock interivewer for Gainlo.\n\nI've been an interviewer for this company/guy for a couple of weeks to test the waters and see how it operates. The focus of this service is to make it possible for people to get interviewed by engineers working at large, well-known tech companies like Google/Amazon/Microsoft/etc and get honest feedback without any risk. The person/entity/group behind Gainlo, \"Jake\" ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-cook-259bab101/)), acts as the middleman for matching people up and charges a fee of anywhere from $100-200+. **I don't recommend it.**\n\nI had a friend reach out for a quote for a 1-hour coding interview for a junior position and was asked for $150 to be matched with an interviewer with no real verified identification. The verification process for these interviewers is that they ask interviewers for a LinkedIn profile. Not only is this something you could easily do yourself, but it's just as easy for the interviewer to fake their credentials and pretend to be a developer at a big company by citing someone else's LinkedIn profile.\n\nFor reference, I was being given $40-50 per session (45m interview, 15m verbal feedback, ~30m for written feedback) as a senior developer. I don't know what other interviewers were being given.  They are taking a huge cut for playing matchmaker when people could instead be getting interviews for free or at least get bids on Reddit forums for mock interviews.\n\n* r/CSCareerQuestions\n* r/CS_Questions\n* r/AskComputerScience\n* r/ComputerScience\n* r/LearnProgramming \n* $58-80 http://techmockinterview.com/ \n* free: (Peer-2-Peer) https://www.pramp.com/ https://www.interviewbit.com/\n\nIn case anyone is interested, I will do mock interviews for a fee, send me a PM. \n\nIf you're not ready for mock interviews, there's so many free practice coding exercises available like LeetCode, InterviewCake, and HackerRank to name a few. I don't recommend Cracking the Coding Interview since it's outdated, asks tricky questions rather than ones that require problem solving, and some solutions are not realistic to code up in 45 minutes on a whiteboard.",

(100 times)) there will some compressor which will output a string of lower length. Therefore we don't care to compress EVERY string, just the ones that are incompressible.\nThis doesn't seem to violate the pigeonhole principle, at least, at first glance. In fact, since it's obvious that there are fewer incompressible strings than there are total strings, why not just index them? Say we order all length N strings lexicographically:\n0x0000..00(n times) - compressible \n0x0000..(n-1 times)01 - compressible\n...\n(random data) - first incompressible string - index 1\nand so on till\n0xFFFF..FF(n times) - compressible\nAnd we just store the index of the string we're trying to compress. Since there are less incompressible strings than there are strings, why wouldn't this work? Wouldn't we eventually (as n gets large enough) save at least 1 bit?\nSorry for the long post, and grats if you got this far.\nThanks in advance.",

I like rubiks cubes, throwing shotput, playing and watching basketball and football, sneakers, video games, and I love to gain new knowledge. I also would be very interested in any books that pertain to creating good life habits, being succesful/happy or maximizing efficiency in life (if that makes sense). I dont read very much besides school assigned reading, but I think if I could find a good book to listen to I would enjoy it. Any book on the things I mentioned that will give me more useful/interesting knowledge on a subject would be awesome! Any suggestions are appreciated!",

        "text": "This is one of those questions that I'm sure that come up in formal CS training frequently, but I wanted to get your opinion on it. \n\nImagine that you have a set of user Objects, \"U\".  Each U has three properties, X, Y, and Z, where X is an array, Y is an array, and Z is an array.  Let's assume for simplicity that they're all an array of integers.  \n\nSo for example:\n\n    const Bill = new User({\n       x:[1, 5, 9]\n       y:[3, 9, 16]\n       z:[2, 4, 99]\n    })\n\n    const Gary = new User({\n       x:[7, 5, 13]\n       y:[16, 4, 12]\n       z:[4, 8, 77] \n    })\n\n    const Jane = new User({\n       x: [5, 13, 22]\n       y: [4, 88, 21]\n       z: [77, 0, 153]\n    })\n\nWhat we're looking for is triple matches.  That is, we're looking to see if there is a matching X between the users, a matching Y, between the two users, and a matching Z between the users. We're looking for a match in all three columns.  \n\nThe output would be something along the lines of: \n\n    [{ \n      matches: {x : 5, y: 16, z: 4},\n      users: [Bill, Gary] \n    },\n    {\n      matches: {x: 5, y:4, z: 77},\n      users: [Gary, Jane],\n    },\n    { \n       matches: {x: 13, y4, z: 77},\n       users: [Gary, Jane]\n    }]\n      \n\nLet's now assume that you have &gt;100,000 of these users, and you're looking to return ALL possible triple matches between them all.  \n\nWhat's the best way to approach this \n\nA) From an algorithmic standpoint. \n\nB) From a practical standpoint (i.e, is this something that should be done in processing or can it be written as an SQL query? \n\nC) Would sorting the integers help.
