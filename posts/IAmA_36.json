I'm the director of the MIT Media Lab, an advocate for open access, a serial entrepreneur and VC, and I sit on the boards of various organizations. Last year, the MIT Media Lab launched the Disobedience Award: a $250,000, no-strings-attached cash prize in recognition of an extraordinary act of responsible disobedience that impacts society in positive ways. Last year, we gave the first award to Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and Professor Marc Edwards, who led the whistleblowing efforts in the Flint, Michigan water crisis. We also awarded three finalists $10,000 each and invited them to a panel at the award ceremony. The Media Lab is once again calling for nominations for the Disobedience Award: https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/disobedience-award/.\n\nI'm here to answer your questions about the award, my views on disobedience, and, of course, anything else.",

        "text": "The book's title is *A New Reality: Human Evolution for a Sustainable Future*, and it is like a vaccine of hope in these difficult times. It both provides an understanding of our current situation and indicates a path forward.\n\nJonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine in the 1955, saving millions of lives. Later in his life he developed an evolutionary philosophy that pointed to an epochal transition in human values and attitudes that is occurring during our lifetimes. *A New Reality* is a concise and beautiful presentation of that perspective.\n\nThe basic idea is we are at a transition point in world population growth, which after centuries of acceleration is just now decelerating and heading toward a plateau toward the end of this century. A graph of this shows an S-shaped curve.\n\nAs we encounter planetary limits, we not only go through a transition in growth, but also a shift in human values from those of unrestrained consumption, competition, independence, and win-lose thinking to those of sustainability, cooperation, interdependence and win-win strategies.\n\nAt this time of transition, there is an expected conflict between the older values of the past and the newer ones of the future. This is the conflict that is now being played out on the national and world stage.  Seen in the short-term, this conflict in values appears chaotic and without resolution. Seen in the longer-term, it is an expected and temporary part of an evolutionary process.\n\nThis transition is significant.  If we fail to make the change to the newer values, we risk extinction; if we succeed we will not only survive but will likely live in a world of greater levels of health, human satisfaction and creativity than we have ever known.\n\nThat's a very quick summary of an elegant argument.\n\nBut please, just ask me anything. I look forward to your questions.\n\nJonathan\n\nProof: [https://i.imgur.com/8FXe2Kk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8FXe2Kk.jpg)\n\nFor more information:  [www.anewrealitybook.com](https://www.anewrealitybook.com)\n\nTo read the book before the AMA:  [https://amzn.to/2OvKTwR](https://amzn.to/2OvKTwR)",

        "text": "Hi r/IAmA!\n\nMy name is [Holly Hardman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362454/) of [Gobbo Films, LLC](http://www.gobbofilms.com/), and I am the director/producer of the documentary-in-production, [*As Prescribed*](https://asprescribedfilm.com). *As Prescribed* features the story of everyday people who thought they were merely being good patients when they followed doctors’ orders and took their prescribed benzodiazepine(s) for anxiety or insomnia, and, in one case, for something as random as a stomach infection. They all suffered adverse effects from the drug that went unrecognized for years. Many are still dealing with the consequences; some are going through a difficult withdrawal process, suffering serious neurological insult and physiological damage. We will wrap filming in late August 2018, and have already begun the film’s edit. We are currently [raising funds to complete post-production](https://www.asprescribedfilm.com/donations.html). The film is tentatively set to release in spring 2019.\n\n**Brief summary of the film:** For almost sixty years, doctors have been prescribing benzodiazepines. The drugs bear well-known names: Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Ativan. They are commonly thought of as safe, helping to “take the edge off” or give a better night's sleep. *As Prescribed*, however, documents a strikingly different narrative. Through personal accounts and investigating mounting evidence, the film reveals the errant medical culture that promotes them. The result is the story of an epidemic that is devastating lives globally.\n\n**My story and the motivation behind the film:** I was prescribed Klonopin for chronic fatigue syndrome and took it after my doctor assured me that the medication was safe to take long-term. However, as tolerance to Klonopin developed insidiously, I began to develop strange symptoms, including gastrointestinal issues, panic attacks while driving, and a foggy, “drugged” feeling. My doctor never connected these adverse effects to Klonopin, a common oversight, as it turns out; and it was only when I began researching online that I was able to make the connection and create a tapering plan. It took me almost two years to taper off completely, during which time I experienced hellish withdrawal symptoms like akathisia (a tortuous inner compulsion to move) and aphasia (the inability to form words and sentences). Even though my own withdrawal was harrowing, I learned of others who had much worse experiences and even some who did not survive. It was then that I knew I had to do something and began work on *As Prescribed*. I am hoping that the film gets the word out about the dangers of benzodiazepine misprescribing to doctors and patients alike, allowing would-be and current patients the truly informed consent that they deserve and that most are not currently receiving.\n\n**What are benzodiazepines? What is the problem?:** [Benzodiazepines, or “benzos,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) are a class of psychoactive drug commonly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, seizures and alcohol withdrawal, although they are also often prescribed “off-label” for a plethora of other conditions. They are in the family of drugs known as minor tranquilizers and are typically recommended for short-term use (2-4 weeks, including tapering off period, per most respected guidelines) by many esteemed individuals, institutions, government bodies, as well as package inserts. The problem arises when benzodiazepines are prescribed for longer periods of time and physical dependence, or neuroadaptation to the chronic presence of the drug, as well as tolerance, develops. Tapering off can be debilitating, taking many months or years; and some unlucky patients go on to develop protracted neurological and physiological harm that persists for years post-cessation. To fully understand the problem, I encourage everyone to read the entire [sordid history of the benzodiazepine drug class](http://benzoinfo.com/2017/12/13/a-brief-history-of-benzodiazepines/), including the [revival of the market for them](https://beyondmeds.com/2010/04/14/the-revival-of-the-market-for-benzodiazepines/) after the Valium craze of the 70s.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** In making this film, it is not my intention to have benzodiazepines banned or taken away from those patients who feel the benefits of taking them long-term for a serious health condition significantly outweighs the risks. This class of drug can be extremely useful short-term. Life is not always black and white; I understand that. That said, severe cases warranting long-term prescription, in light of risks, should be the exception, as opposed to the norm, which is not what we see happening in current practice. I also advocate for benzodiazepine patients who are already iatrogenically physically-dependent; they need to be allowed to decide for themselves if they wish to stay on or attempt a taper, especially those (e.g., the frail or elderly) for which withdrawal might be too risky or dangerous.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**Here is my** [**proof**](https://twitter.com/GobboFilms/status/1021496948791169025)**!**\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n**Important links:**\n\n[Trailer](https://vimeo.com/153984287)\n\n[As Prescribed's website](https://asprescribedfilm.com)\n\n[To donate towards completion of post production](https://www.asprescribedfilm.com/donations.html)\n\n**Find me on social media!**\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/asprescribedfilm/)\n\n[Holly Hardman’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/holly_hardman)\n\n[Gobbo Films’ Twitter](https://twitter.com/GobboFilms)\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hollyhardmannow/)\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the solid questions (no fluff!) and for your interest in As Prescribed and the topic of benzodiazepines.
