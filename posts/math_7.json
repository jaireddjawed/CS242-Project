        "text": "Let V and U be two vectors of dimension m and n respectively. Define ⊡ as a function on two vectors V and U such that the result of V ⊡ U is equal to a matrix A, described as:\n\n|a(1, 1)|...|a(1, n)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|...|...|...|\n|a(m, 1)|...|a(m, n)|\n\n, where a(i, j) = V(i)+U(j).   \nProve whether for any given (n, m), there can exist an equation for V(n) in terms of a combination of components of A.  \n\n\n(I didn't really know how to say the combination doesn't have to be linear (you can have a(3)\\*a(2)!), but all variables on one side of the equation for V(i) have to be from A, so no v(3)=u(2)+a(3,2) or something.)  \n\n\nThis has really cool implications! I looked at times tables where each component &gt; 0 (and this is just the natural log of that) and I see some really interesting conclusions if you can find a solution or if you can't! For example, if a certain matrix A can be expressed in terms of V(i) and U(j), then if you add 1 to n or m, you only need 1 extra a(i, j) value to make it solvable and not an entire row or column! And then what does it say about higher dimensions? A new vector W producing A as a tensor of order 3?? This is a lot, but I'm more interested in the original question. Let me know if I need to clarify anything!",

To be precise, by \"pre-1970\" I mean the **last edition was first published before 1970**. I'd say later reprints/corrections are OK, but not later editions.\n\nFor example, I do think Kelley's *General Topology* could still be used today, as well as some books by Paul Halmos: *Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces* (1958, 2nd ed), *Measure Theory* (1950), *Naive Set Theory* (1960). When I took my undergrad course in complex analysis, instead of a standard book like Ahlfors, my professor chose Titchmarsh's *The Theory of Functions* (1939, 2nd ed). I thought it was a good book, despite no illustrations. I think lots of old introductory complex analysis books would still be relevant today.",

I have attempted CFA and FRM exam but failed at both. I am currently studying math(from school to college level). I want to work in Risk or Quant and hence I started learning math. At the moment I am doubting myself If I should continue with this. I have applied for MA Economics from a distance university and hoping to get into full time Masters in Economics in Netherlands next year. My grades were low(2.33/4) in College(B.Com) and I feel this will affect my chances of getting into a good Economics college. I need an advice on if I should continue with Math and what are the things I should do to have a big impact on myself in the next 1.5 years?",

        "text": "Visited this amazing seaside region in the Murud-Janjira region of Maharashtra yesterday and I have not been able to contain the level of excitement and joy i got from the trip. I kind of stand mesmerized and amazed at the beauty of such places that have been distant and unexplored by humans, they would literally crowd such regions and the place just loses it's essence. \nThere's something really different about visiting the beaches that humans tend to feel, i feel a lack of words to describe the state of feelings i experience in such cases. I believe it is a rush of overwhelming thoughts and feelings that one experiences as a result of serene beauty and the presence of oneself in the best form of nature in it's existence.\nThe cool breeze, the warm summer feels, the wet sand that absorbs traces of footprints, the shells and small rocks that can be collected, the rustling leaves of trees, the presence of crabs/squirrels and birds in the frame of nature, the cool and wady water that touches the feet- a feeling that is just indescribable for minds to comprehend the rush of feelings/emotions.\nThe visit to the beach has made me feel and realize that although i acknowledge and practice acts and gestures that makes me feel more connected to the existence of nature and my presence in it, i feel like that this need to connect with mother nature is just lovely as it gets and i would never be finding myself getting tired of it. It makes me realize that i need to improve the connection, it acts as a blissful addition of peace and happiness to an individual's state of mind, something that i am not afraid to inculcate in my life. Travelling and exploring new places is something i do of my own interests, when i have the appropriate time and it teaches me quite the few things over the passing of time in the daily hustle and bustle of a fast paced monotonous lifestyle.\nI am not really much of an expressive human, but i'm looking for ways and gaining the courage to thank my very good friends to take me out on such a good trip, something i believe they deserve to be told and thanked, for making the day worth remembering by.",

On the second page of text (p.4) their is what looks like an egregious blunder, which he took and ran with.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Am I the one who's wrong?\n\nHe's talking about Heron of Alexandria and the problem of finding the height (h) of the frustum of a square pyramid, given the sides of the bottom and top squares (a &amp; b), and the slant distance (c) between them. Ie: find a leg of a right triangle given the hypotenuse and the other leg. \n\nHe gives, but doesn't derive, the formula \n\nh=sqrt(c^2 -2*((a-b)/2)^2)\n\nWhere did that factor of 2 come from?? \n\nHe then goes to a case where the a=28, b=4, and the slope length, c=15. So the bottom leg of the relevant triangle is 12. \n\n((a-b)/2)^2 = 12^2 =144. And sqrt(225-144)=9. A nice classical 3,4,5 right triangle.\n\nBut instead, Nahin takes the sqrt(81-144)=-63, which he says is \"required by the formula\". and gives **an imaginary number - for the side of a real world frustum!** He ignores the impossibility of that result, and goes on to berate Heron for ignoring the minus sign.\n\nThat 81 is 9^2. Where did that come from? 9 was the hypotenuse in the **different problem** immediately preceding this one. Is that the blunder? \n\nHe apparently doesn't notice that the hypotenuse of the triangle is shorter than a leg, another impossibility in the real Euclidean world.\n\nHe then berates Heron for ignoring the minus sign under the square root. And states that the original documents show sqrt(63) as the answer.\n\nThis looks like (blunders)^2, or maybe ^3.\n\nOr have I misunderstood, and there really were real world solids with imaginary sides in antiquity?",

        "text": "It is beyond well-known that multiplication in the complex plane has a geometric interpretation, namely we can interpret multiplication by $z\\\\in \\\\mathbb C$ as acting on the plane by fixing $0$, and dragging the point $1$ to $z$, keeping all square grid-lines squares. One can see animations of this in [this 3B1B video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvmuCPvRoWQ&amp;ab_channel=3Blue1Brown), for instance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the case of multiplying two complex numbers $a,b$, one can imagine making 2 triangle (resp. called $A,B$) with vertices at $0,1,a$ and $0,1,b$, and then $a$ \"acting\" on $b$ would mean scaling and rotating triangle $B$ so that the line segment originally between $0,1$ is now the line segment from $0,a$; and then where $b$ lands is the result of $a \\\\cdot b$ \"$a$ acting on $b$\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, we can understand $b \\\\cdot a$ in the same manner, but now the picture produced is changed, and I don't find it obvious geometrically that the result of $a\\\\cdot b$ and $b\\\\cdot a$ should be exactly the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI messed around a little, and the problem is pretty easy if we understand the multiplication actions separately in terms of pure rotation (in which case commutativity boils down to commutativity of angle addition, which Euclid takes as a \"common notion\" [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/\\~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html), for example in his proof of the [vertical angle theorem I.15](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/propI15.html)), and pure dilation (in which case the argument boils down to finding a lot of similar triangles, and using another commutativity result [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/\\~djoyce/elements/bookV/propV23.html](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookV/propV23.html), which I found after Googling \"euclid proved commutativity of multiplication\" leading to [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1365715/could-euclid-have-proven-that-real-number-multiplication-is-commutative](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1365715/could-euclid-have-proven-that-real-number-multiplication-is-commutative)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I didn't really like that proof since it really just sort of splits up multiplication into 2 separate pieces that fall back on just commutativity of addition/ratios for essentially real numbers. It's akin to proving commutativity of complex multiplication by separating into real and imaginary parts and using commutativity of the real numbers. Of course it works, but what I really want is something fundamentally \"planar\"/\"2-dimensional\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went ahead and constructed everything in Geogebra [https://www.geogebra.org/m/twce3tar](https://www.geogebra.org/m/twce3tar) (using Euclid's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass\\_equivalence\\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_equivalence_theorem) 5 times to construct all the similar triangles I needed). Below is a screenshot: the dark green $A$ and dark red $B$ can be moved by the user, as well as the points $C,N$ on the real line marked by a big X symbol. The statement of commutativity then becomes that the following observation: the 2 dark red dashed-dotted lines meet at the point $A\\\\cdot B$ (multiplication action from $A$ scaling the plane, acting on $B$), and the green dark dashed-dotted line meets those 2 dark red dashed-dotted lines at the SAME point. I was hoping that constructing everything from scratch, it would help me see exactly how this concurrence occurs, but alas it just made the picture very muddled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[commutativity of complex multiplication](https://preview.redd.it/7146wqwr40ma1.png?width=2726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=07898b1eb01dbbe78ff5cc19ebeb862250e1fc2e)\n\nalmost looks like something [out of CERN](https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/seeing-invisible-event-displays-particle-physics) lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat this is a result about concurrence of 3 lines reminded me of Desargues's theorem [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27s\\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27s_theorem) which is known in some sense to \"characterize planar geometry\" (loosely speaking), but drawing out the axis of perspectivity (in the Geogebra as a bright yellow line in the lower half plane) didn't reveal anything to me.",

        "text": "So I deal with -somewhat- of a learning disability that made math borderline impossible when I was in high school. I have really bad short term memory and numbers/formulas get lost in my brain easily. Once I found medication in adulthood that made all executive functioning easier, I decided to have another go at college (I currently have an associates and am pursuing a bachelors) and everything was going well. I found I really enjoy math and I can be good at it if I work hard enough. I still struggle to remember formulas, it’s a work in progress, but I was having fun. The feeling of solving a problem is such a rush, and I’ve actually been able to apply the logic to real life situations at work which is amazing. \n\nI’ve aced every quiz and homework for Calculus and have willingly spent hours researching the topics for my class, and I legitimately found it interesting. Had to brush up on algebra a bit but I was happy to. I was excited to be able to absorb this type of info in a way I haven’t been able to before. Then came the exam…and I walked out of it super confident that I’d at least gotten a B. Turns out I scored a 69.75, literally. I chalk it up to anxiety making me forget important info in the moment. \n\nNow I’m trying to jump back into math and I’m really struggling. I am not soaking in the info the way I was at first, I’ve lost the motivation, I have this sinking feeling similar to when I was in high school that all the info is just hitting a wall. I want to feel excited and exhilarated again, I want to enjoy the challenge again. Instead I just feel kinda hopeless and don’t know how to break the cycle, because it’s impacting my ability to learn. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How were you able to overcome it? I would appreciate any and all advice. I know the obvious one is “study” but I was studying for at least 2-3 hours a day while working FT. I’m looking to reawaken that drive to study at all, or to actually remember what it is I’m studying. \n\nThank you!",
