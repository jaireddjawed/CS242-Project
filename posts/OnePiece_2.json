But there is an instance where King is having a flashback and not paying too much attention to Zoro and he Launches  \"**King of Hell Three Sword Style** : **Purgatory Oni Giri**\". The attack might have connected, I couldn't tell. But Zoro says he did no damage cause the flame is on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img zryf7nbnz3oa1...*\n\nThere is a scene where King blocks Zoro's attacks instead of tanking them even with Flame. Zoro mocks King that he is scared,  but this is not enough in my opinion to confirm Zoro's attacks will damage King on Flame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 2ihllo6c04oa1...*",

It came to my attention that in the  Blackbeard Pirates aswell as in the Straw Hat‚Äôs theres 1 Duo of members, those being Nami/Zeus and Doc Q/Stronger\nIm lowkey liking the thought of them duking it out in the finale as they also arent primarily fighters. Plus it takes us away from the cliche Doctor vs Doctor, Navigator vs Navigtor theories that‚Äòve been in the community for so long. Furthermore it opens up the possibility for Brook vs Lafitte who I think match up wayyyy better.\n2. Who do you see as Jimbeis matchup out of the BB‚Äòs and why?\nshare your thoughts :)",
