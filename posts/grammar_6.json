        "text": "I'm new to proofreading and currently working on a manuscript where it feels like the copy editor has gone a bit overboard with hyphenating adjectives that precede nouns.\n\nOne issue that has come up a lot is that whenever an open compound noun is functioning as an adjective, the copy editor has added a hyphen to the compound noun. This feels unnecessary to me, but I can't seem to find a grammar resource online that specifically discusses how to handle open compound nouns being used as adjectives.\n\nFor example, \"smoke detector battery\" has been corrected to \"smoke-detector battery.\" Since \"smoke detector\"  is an open compound noun, according to the dictionary of choice, why is it not okay to leave \"smoke detector battery\" in the manuscript? Is adding a hyphen the grammatically correct approach to take in this scenario?",

In this case, the challenges are specifically related to Millennials, however Millennials have a lot of challenges, so I do not want to specify them.  \n\n\nSecondly, is it \"of\" Millenials or \"for\" Millenials?  \n\n\nBasically I try to decide between 4 options:  \n1) Addressing Challenges of Millennials  \n2) Addressing the Challenges of Millennials  \n3) Addressing Challenges for Millennials  \n4) Addressing the Challenges for Millennials\n\nThanks in advance,  \nLeon",

        "text": "Are the words \"them\" and \"those\" pronouns? I always thought they were and that it was grammatically incorrect to use the word \"them\" AND the thing it was referring to.\n\nFor example, you either say:\n\n\"Have you seen Brian?\"\n\nor\n\n\"Have you seen him?\"\n\nBecause \"him\" is a pronoun used in place of \"Brian\", the name of the person. Saying \"Have you seen him Brian?\" just looks odd.\n\nSo if we were to use \"them\" or \"those\" in a sentence, does the same apply? Here is an example:\n\n\"Look at them trees.\"\n\n\"Look at the trees.\"\n\nIn this case \"them\" applies to the trees. Why is it so common to make the mistake of saying \"them trees\"? You don't add pronouns like he/she/it as well as the name, so why is \"them/those\" treated different?",

However, there are some minor issues with sentence structure that could be improved.\n\nPunctuation: The writing mostly uses appropriate punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and quotation marks. However, there are a few instances where the use of punctuation could be improved for clarity.\n\nHere are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n* In the first sentence, there should be a comma after \"myth\" to separate the two independent clauses.\n* In the second sentence, the phrase \"black professionals being questioned whether they're competent or not\" is missing a verb. It should read, \"black professionals being questioned about their competence.\"\n* In the third sentence, there should be a comma after \"competence\" to separate the two independent clauses.\n* In the fourth sentence, the phrase \"a white person's competence being called into question\" is missing a verb. It should read, \"a white person's competence being questioned.\"\n\nOverall, the writing is well-crafted and easy to understand, with only a few minor grammar and punctuation errors.",

Again, I was taught that the subject is the thing performing the action and the object is the thing receiving the action.\n\nHowever, in passive voice, we use the OVS construction, and you can even have sentences with just the object and the verb. For example, in the sentence \"the ball was thrown,\" nobody is performing the action, and it is considered passive voice.\n\nTherefore, my question is, does every sentence need a subject? Or does it only need one in SVO construction?",

And the run was unsupported so you have to bring your own supplies. So we had, you know, we overdid it a little bit. We had a tent and we had masseuses and food. I mean we were ready for, like, in case we had to stay there a week. And he had a folding chair, a bottle of water and a bag of crackers. And I just thought to myself like, \"Who is this guy?\" I’ve never seen anything like it. And during the race, I kept an eye on him and around mile 70 — he weighed probably 260 pounds, which is quite large for an ultra runner — he had broken all the small bones in both of his feet and had kidney damage and he finished the race. So when it was done, I Googled him. He had a fascinating life story and I decided literally to cold call him. And I flew out and met with him and after sitting with him for a couple of minutes, I realized that I could learn so much from a guy like this that what makes him tick and various **bucket**s in my life would be so much better if a little bit of what he had rubbed off on me. I asked him to come live with my family and I for a month. So at the time that I invited \"SEAL\" to come live with us I had an 18-month-old son. I was married, still am. Two more kids since. And I had sold a couple of businesses. I was in a great place professionally in my life, but I was also in a routine. And routines are great, but they can also be a rut. And I found that I just wasn’t getting better. I was doing the same thing every day like so many of us. Wake up; go to work; come home, you know; have dinner; repeat. And I just wanted to get off autopilot. And I thought that he would be a great way to get in good shape, but also to just mix up my routine and get better.",
