Today I received a 1 month notice from my job that my contract wasn't going to be renewed.\n\n\nI am thinking of freelancing for a bit and working up my portfolio. Thing is, I would like to make it my part-time job alongside uni. I have made a reservation system/worked with databases (CRUD in php) and I have been doing HTML/CSS for 7 months now.\n\n I would be able to make front end and even some back-end work, but is my wxperience really enough to be paid? I know beginning developers often have imposter syndrome and that is how I am feeling right now so I'm not sure if I should use my portfolio work as a source of income just yet.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!",

Variety of projects for IOS dev, Python backend stuff, and an Arduino/robotics car, etc. Do well on behaviorals but tend to fail or score poorly on OAs. Will be doing the Codepath Intermediate IOS dev course in a few weeks. \n\nI have been offered to join my current school's Robotics team where we aim to make the Boston Dynamics robot SPOT. Unsure of my responsibilities and time needed from the team so far. \n\nTo me, this sounds really cool but I don't know if it will really help me out in getting an internship as I feel a lot of companies using robotics will be defense companies that cant hire F1 students. Maybe I am wrong? \n\nMore importantly, since transferring schools I am struggling to Leetcode as much due to travel time to the school (2.5 hrs total) x2 week. I average 3-4hr/week-ish now, which I know I need to improve on.\n\nThus, what is the easiest field to get an internship in? Web dev, IOS/Android dev, AI/ML, Cyber, etc? \n\nShould I take on extra responsibility to join the Robo team? I don't want to join and then back out and look bad as I am new to the school.\n\nThanks all!",

I'm currently working on a React Native app for one company along with a greenfield Next and TypeScript project for a new company.\n\nI am very happy that I get to work with many different technologies and build interesting solutions in different stacks.

The small % of people who landed jobs have nice portfolios and mostly good projects. I have seen a handful of amazing ones. So I haven't picked a bootcamp that I'm comfortable spending 20k on yet. My cousin said this is wrong of me to do and everyones takeaways will be different. Personally, I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong by considering this? Fullstack Bootcamps having student portfolios and class projects with a failed backend is a red flag right??

My course was originally for a PhD, but I realised that I'm no longer interested and motivated to pursue research/academia in this particular field.\n\nI decided to cut my project short and complete it sooner to graduate with a Master's rather than a PhD. I've been looking into other potential career options, and data science is one of those options.\n\nA potential issue is that I would be a complete beginner in this field. I have no formal education in data science, and my only experience with mathematics and statistics post high school are that which I've used in my biomedical research, as well as one stats unit in undergrad science, and a short stats unit in my Honours year.\n\nIf I were to pursue data science as a career, would I need to complete an undergrad data science degree from scratch? Are there shorter courses that could fast-track or provide credit for possible admission to a postgraduate course? I understand these are two wildly different fields, but would there be much consideration for transferable skills such as general research experience? Are there any resources you would recommend to get started with learning the fundamentals of data science before getting into potential further study?\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

Should I apply to React jobs if I get laid off even though I only know Angular? \n\nAlso, if React is usually a hard requirement for companies that list it as so, what is the best way I could demonstrate React skills to potential employers as an Angular dev? For example, should I build some projects in React and create a portfolio so that I can be like “I’m an Angular dev, but look at these projects I made in React, here is proof that I can pick things up quickly and do the job”? Does anyone think something like this would get me a React job?\n\nI would like my next job to be a React job instead of an Angular job anyways, just because React seems to be more in demand.

I’m pretty damn good at creating React apps and nice looking websites, and understand core concepts like OOP and all that jazz. I can write nice code aside from web dev and have even become intermediate with Three.js.\n\nThough, I’m starting to worry it won’t be enough, at least for the time being. I can tell this is a tough environment and given that I only have an associates degree, I feel it’s a big long shot to land something these days.\n\nI’m interested in going back to school to get a degree while the market sucks. Then again, I’m thinking about moving away from web dev altogether.\n\nI heard it’s where the jobs are but it seems with AI and such I feel it will be one the faster shrinking fields. \n\nI’d like to study AI and be one to bring real value to the table. \n\nTo do that, I’d definitely need a degree right? I can’t just learn all that and think I’ll land a top AI engineer role… right?\n\nAt a crossroads and no one else around is familiar with this stuff to ask.",

I purchased it at the recommendation of a former coworker, and I’ve seen it recommended on Reddit as well. So for those who are speeding over all soy-faced to tell me I wasted my money and there’s free resources out there already, go clean the Dorito dust off your keyboard. I bought the course, it’s done, now I want to utilize it as best I can.\n\nSo to those who have successfully used this course as part of preparation to pass a system design interview, what is your advice to best utilize Grokking? I’m finding that the course is loading a lot of terms and calculations (regarding capacity) up front, and while it’s certainly interesting, I’m having trouble understanding how this info would translate to a crafting a system design. Of course, I can buy into the idea that it’s important to clarify requirements and system scale at the beginning of the interview, but I’m not at a point yet where I feel comfortable coming up with those design decisions to answer something as open ended as “Design WhatsApp” or “Design Netflix”. I should note that I’ve had 1.5 YOE at a FAANG, so I’m in that weird space where I’m technically not a new grad, but I’m definitely not senior level yet, and mid level feels a bit generous imo. Notably, I haven’t had real experience designing big systems from the ground up, yet some of the roles I’m interviewing for expect system design, so it’s like I’m having to punch above my weight class here. 😞 (Had to vent for a second, I’m kinda burnt out with interviewing atm)\n\nAgain, I’m only 10% through the course so it very well might be that the course brings it all together later on. But if anyone has insight as to how I can best utilize Grokking for preparation beyond just binge reading the material (which is what it kind of feels like at the moment if I’ll be honest), I’d really appreciate it. Also if anyone can recommend good supplementary material, I’m all ears. Thanks!",

I am a little older, and switched from a managerial position to this role one year ago. I've previously worked for companies in a business capacity, and I'm not sure if software engineering is just normally like this or not.\n\nThe company is working me to the point that I'm unhappy. Here are some things I've seen:\n\n* No established procedures, and things are always on fire. I start most days putting out fires, answering questions about why data doesn't look right, etc. There is no new engineering work that I'm working on. It's just constantly maintaining this train wreck.\n* I can have 4-5 hours of meetings in a day on top of dev work. Because there are no established processes, I oftentimes go into meetings with little understanding. I leave these meetings without much better understanding.\n* My company laid off employees late last year. Luckily, I survived. Management told us we were doing financially well all year long, and hit us with this news out of the blue.\n* My boss is a good engineer, but a poor manager. He has no respect for people's time. He will regularly email and Slack people at odd hours (1am, 10pm, etc.) and ask them to do things. A couple weeks ago, he gave me a brand new task as 3pm on a Friday and asked me to complete it before the day was over.\n* I have worked overtime during weeknights and weekends.\n* I took a pay cut to switch careers, and it is lower than big tech because it's a startup. But perhaps I need to pay my dues by switching careers.\n\nI am looking for a new place, but the current environment is tough. I have a final round interview lined up next week with a large multinational company that is known to be tech-oriented.\n\nIs what I'm going through normal for software engineering?

Many years ago I learned Python for basic tasks and since then have been gradually attracted to deep learning and natural language processing while being disillusioned with overblown theories and lack of rigor in the social sciences.   \nI last fall have started an online master's in CS. Then I found that a few companies (e.g. Meta) have job positions called People Scientist and recruited social-science phds with some analytical abilities. I think I could be a great fit. But these types of jobs seem to be so rare. \n\n1. Does anyone know any info about people scientists either in your firm or in general? I think the emphasis for these jobs should be on ML, not HR, but last time I checked the people scientists at Meta, they are just social-science phds with no programming/CS backgrounds. People scientists might be just a fancy trendy name for HR analysts although their job requirements say applicants should do the programming like ML and NLP.  \n2. I think I should be preparing for jobs more broadly to get an entry-level position as MLE, DS, or SWE and then aim for such jobs later. What do you think?

I’m passionate about neither of them, I enjoy both of them, the challenge keeps me interested and wanting to learn more. I would prefer to keep my passion projects and hobbies as just that, therefore I’m trying to get an idea of what jobs/career I want to build that has the best bang for my time insofar as time off, livable+ wage, upward mobility (IT &gt; cyber, software &gt; software?), and opportunity so that I don’t stagnate in one company until I’m up into my 40s and settling down. \n\nWhat has been your experiences so far?",

        "text": "I've worked at my company for almost 5 years. Although it was my first job out of school I'm now one of the more senior developers on our team (very small company). Lately I've been spending a lot of time reviewing other people's code/merge requests, which is where my problem comes in.\n\nI have a coworker, let's call him Bart, who apparently has 15+ years of experience. I had absolutely nothing to do with his hiring, but in interacting with him I noticed some issues right away. At first I thought some of these issues came from Bart not being very fluent in English (we are an entirely English company), but I'm really starting to think it's more than this. I also went through a phase where I thought maybe I was discriminating against him for not speaking English well, but it's not that either I'm pretty sure. I spent time to really think on it, and it's just so much more than that.\n\nHe doesn't know basic coding structures (switch statements, throwing an exception, public vs private functions, etc). He doesn't seem to test his code; whenever I load it up it's a buggy mess. Nobody is perfect, I'm certainly not, and bugs get through. But his code will like fundamentally break, data will be stored totally wrong in the database, or his code just straight-up won't meet the requirements of the project. Not to mention just general formatting and code standards are totally out the window.\n\nHe will often ask me questions, and continue to ask/probe until I basically write out the answer to what he needs. I've spoken to two other devs that have said that they've tried to explain stuff to him and eventually given up and just written his code for him. I can tell cause sometimes I review his MRs and it's clearly not stuff he wrote (overall code style, comments, etc).\n\nUltimately, I'm not his supervisor, I'm not paid to manage anyone or take responsibility for anyone's production. But the thing is he's wasting so much of my time, and I'm getting aggravated by it. I pointed out a bug to him in his MR, then 24 hours later he comes to me and is like \"hey... I noticed this is broken how do I fix it\" and I just didn't know how to deal with it. I will spend an hour on a call with him explaining our basic code structures, things he should know at this point (he's been here a year), I will literally point at parts of his code, explain how to test it and what he should look for. Then he'll come to me a day later and just be like \"help I don't get it\".\n\nI've spoken to my manager and explained my frustrations with him, and how spending all this time helping Bart is taking away from my productivity. One of my projects was going long and I had to explain how I had to regularly take 1-4  hours out of my day to point out all the things Bart did wrong in his MR or answering his questions. My manager said, and I quote, \"working with [Bart] is indeed a challenge\". Nothing more.\n\nAll this is to say, what can I do? I mentioned my experience at the beginning of the post because it feels a little relevant. I'm basically given the responsibilities of a senior dev but none of the recognition or credit. I have zero say in anything really.\n\nI know I know, just quit. I'm thinking about it, but I want to be able to spend the time to find a good replacement for this job and I don't know how quickly I'll find it. There are really amazing things about this company that I'm afraid to lose if I quit.\n\nSo, aside from quitting, does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix this? I know it sounds awful but at this point I kinda just want this guy fired or put some boundary with my manager where I never have to review any of his code.",

I would love to know how I can start a conversation with my boss's boss to let them know that I'm very concerned about how things are going down, without painting a target on my back. Here's how I personally imagine this going down.

Several members of my team have come to me expressing concern and frustration about the way things were communicated, deadlines being way too aggressive, and mistakes that were made that normally don't happen. Personally, I found myself very confused throughout the entire project on what was going on, and when I was given an assignment, It felt like I didn't have enough time to complete it. Additionally, for the past 2 weeks, it feels like I don't have enough time to get things done. I've been completely swamped with work, and with this additional project, found myself working past 5:00 p.m. very often.\"\n\n\nAny thoughts or advice? I'm obviously not going to have this conversation at all until I am 100% certain that doing so would not be an utterly stupid, self-destructive idea",

Unfortunately thats the problem: experts in a field actually tend to be the worst at predicting the future.\n\nThis strangely has been observed in research summarized by David Epstein (Author of \"Range\") who studied this phenomenon. The thing is your past experience tends to bias you against future possibilities, it's just how we perceive the world. The more you know about a subject, the less flexible you become about what comprises \"reasonable\" developments in the field. As a result, it actually tends to be people who consider a wide range of possibilities, especially seemingly nonsensical ones, who come closest to predicting the future. In other words: cast aside you certainty because it's the very thing that will bury you\n\nTLDR; The more experience you have, the less flexible you are towards an unprecedented future. Make a conscious effort to consider all possibilities, even seemingly ridiculous ones.",

He’s already talked about making me a business analyst as well so I doubt anything less than full work commitment would be acceptable.\n\nI am left with three options: \n\n1. Go to school and do software engineering (where I am from, it is seen as more prestigious than CS, I get more transfer credits then computer engineering but there is still a lot of redundancy)\n\n2. Go to school and do computer engineering (I don’t know if I like hardware as much but it could allow me to have more job security with this skill set because of the rise of chat gpt).\n\n3. Work another year or two despite the undesirable conditions and leave on good terms, get a recommendation letter and go back to school. Maybe try to take night courses if possible with the workload.\n\nI know that people will say to keep applying but I just keep getting interviews for roles I don’t like, so I left that off as an option.",

        "text": "I got my first job straight out of graduation. I work as a Junior SWE for a large digital consultancy. The culture is nice, pay is decent for the area/my situation, and WLB has been solid. However, I feel as though I’m stagnating career-wise. \n\n\nGiven we’re a consultancy, our work is project-based. In order to be eligible for promotion, we need a certain amount of billable project hours. So far, i haven’t been placed on projects despite networking and trying to put my name out there within the company through internal non-billable projects. Higher ups were promising projects  were coming for a while, but then they turned around and said there’s not much due to economic conditions, so me and many of my colleagues have been “benched” for months, trying to network our way and kiss ass onto projects. I likely may not see a pay increase for another year minimum at least at this rate. And they are refusing to adjust for inflation, despite paying future new-hires more than us.\n\n\n\nI know many of you would be out of here right away, but unfortunately I am not that brave. For one, I don’t have much to put on my resume from work because I haven’t done much despite asking for it. \n\n\n\nOutside of that, I am subpar at leetcode-style problems (didn’t have to for this job), and while I’m trying to practice, I am non-neurotypical and have issues focusing on one thing for a long time and avoiding burnout. I don’t really have personal projects, as programming has never been a hobby for me, just a skill I leveraged into a degree and job. I had an internship my senior year and that’s about it. When work ends or on weekends I don’t really want to code.\n\n\n\nI also struggle with risk aversion and ritual/schedule changes, and despite the issues, my job is comfy and familiar at this point. But at the same time I’m beginning to resent it. I am not being challenged in any way. Just 2 days ago, a senior engineering director tells me at a company happy hour that he might have work for me. Fast forward to today, I’m editing a PowerPoint for him with vague instructions. I didn’t sign up to be a FUCKING POWERPOINT LACKEY.\n\n\nOn top of that, my contract came with a large signing bonus that has a prorated clawback clause for 2 years, but that bonus is now my emergency fund. So I’m basically held hostage with the threat of financial ruin.\n\n\nI just feel trapped and don’t know what to do. The market isn’t great right now unless you’re experienced. I barely have competitive skills like JS web frameworks etc. I have “experience” on paper, but it’s empty experience. I shudder at the thought of even doing LC-style problems in front of interviewers and bombing them like I did so many times before I graduated. I’m trying not to let my mental health spiral here but it’s really tough.",

It's leveraging my current database skills with an eye out to growing within their data engineering/R&amp;D team.  Round two is Monday and assuming I do well, I suspect I will be offered a position within the next 2-3 weeks.\n\nMy dilemma, our team and company is going through a VERY rough transition of the product.  I am one of two database admins, despite trying to hire a third.  Me and my co-DBA who is older and a grandparent, so getting on in age, basically are linchpins of our infrastructure team, and the company realizes what will happen when we leave.  \n\nHowever, for my own quality of life, I can no longer stay here.  I am on call for two week stretches every two weeks, which has taken a toll on my sleep and social life.  After I turn in my notice I plan to document like crazy literally everything I do (already doing some Knowledge Transfer with other team members as general practice), but I feel guilty leaving all database work on my remaining colleague, and loss of productivity with other teammates who need to wait longer to get answers.\n\nFor those who were in linchpin positions and liked your coworkers, how did you do it?  Every time I've left a job before, I was confident those that remained could handle everything without issue, but this time it's different.",

I work at a smaller tech company that offers a SaaS business model. Each of my responsibilities has a significant company impact, but they are varied in technical discipline.  \n\n\nThe issue is that almost all of my responsibilities do not really follow the traditional SRE roles. Here is a list of some projects that I have done:  \n\n\n1. Create financial automation between CSM services and financial services. (IE use webhooks to listen to financial payments and edit CSM Service data accordingly)\n2. Create over 100+ shell scripts that grab diagnostic computer information (IE CPU speed, Memory Usage, Memory Disk Space)\n3. Create a python tool that downloads software from the internet and uploads them to our internal servers using Public API endpoints\n4. Create a python tool that scrapes the internet for data, transforms it, and then stores into our internal DB storage\n5. Gather evidence for security compliance\n6. Manage alerting automation for server outages\n7. Create automation using slack apps and slack block kit to create an interactive GUI for slack forms  \n\n\nThere is a bunch of other stuff I do, but this is the general gist. I am completely confused about where to and how to prepare for a job search since I am confused about my internal role atm.",
