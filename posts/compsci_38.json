I just want to be able to actively run and debug programs on my main pc and run them on the Pi with out writing on the Pi or moving a .py file over to the Pi every time I want to run a piece of code. Please help. \n\nI’m 15 btw and very interested in comp sci and robotics although I have little to no experience coding. My close family has a strong background in electrical engineering so I became interested in robotics.   \n\n\nEDIT: I tried using visual GBD, but every time I go to run the code, it gives and error missing python symbols and it links me to some command lines to put into to the Pi. (sudo apt-get install python-gdb and sudo apt-get install python3-gdb) and the error doesn’t change. Even after a restart of Pi and PC. I have tired different tool chains but the error doesn’t seem to change. I have python fully installed including symbols on my main machine. Any ideas? ",

By reading the Wikipedia article I cannot understand a bit.\n\n&gt;Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor. Under NUMA, a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory (memory local to another processor or memory shared between processors). The benefits of NUMA are limited to particular workloads, notably on servers where the data is often associated strongly with certain tasks or users.\n\nThis is what Wikipedia says and I cannot understand what do they mean by that (probably due to the reasons I mentioned in the title).\n\nDo they mean by local memory, the local cache the processor has or do they mean a small fragment of the main shared memory?\n\nCan someone give me a clear one-sentence definition of what NUMA is?\n\nI apologise for the silly question but I just can't understand it.",

I have done classes in PDE's, Linear and none-linear programming, regression, probability, stochastic processes, time series, just to name a few. I only know how to use R(lots) and Python(1 class) because thats all we used. I am finding it harder then I thought to find work as an actuary now so I'm considering doing computer science. Several of my friend in CS and software engineer all found co-ops and jobs right out of uni paying 80k+ yearly, even the ones with bad grades. I could finish a CS degree in an extra year but then I'd be doing a 6 year undergraduate and have 3 majors. I kinda want to avoid that. Can anyone give me some advice on what to do? Is it possible I do 2 or 3 really important classes in Uni, \"the ones I couldnt learn outside of school\", and do the rest online or on the job? Or is it best I take the extra year? I even considered doing a master in CS but that would also take me an extra semester to get the pre-recs done for it, and then I might as well do the entire major then in 2 semesters. I tried self learning through EdX but I found there wasnt much structure, and without any background its hard to know where to start. Sorry the post is kinda long. I dont know if it matters but I go to the University of British Colubia. Its a pretty decent school and I have about an 80% average. ",

        "text": "Hey guys.\n\nI'm in the process of understanding exactly what Martin Fowler's Remote Facade Pattern actually is and how it's used in practice.\n\nLink to Martin Fowler's definition and the address example I'll be using: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/remoteFacade.html\n\nI understand that the intention of the Remote Facade Pattern is to limit the traffic and the amount of calls made over the network, so instead of calling 3 methods separately over the network to set the address, you should make a Remote Facade that includes a single method to set all the data for the address.\n\nThe problem is that my teacher has given me the impression that a Remote Facade needs to be made on the client and not the server, but if the server only makes available 3 separate methods for setting all the address data and doesn't have a single method that combines the job, then I can make a single method on my client that calls all 3 methods on the server, but that won't result in any less traffic being sent, because 3 methods still have to be invoked over the network.\n\nIs it wrong that the Remote Facade needs to be on the client and not the server or am I missing something?\n\nIn case it makes any difference, in terms of client/server I'm thinking about applications that would require a client and a server to communicate over the network like Socket and Web API.\n\nI would really appreciate if you guys could help me out! Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "I've got a coding scheme in mind for very large, variable-length integers, and I am wondering if I am the inventor, or if it already exists and has a name and even an implementation.\n\nHere's the format:\n\n&gt; [length][data]\n\nLength is one byte long, and cannot be 0.  It specifies the length of data.\n\n&gt; [0][length_2][length][data]\n\nIf your number is too large for the above format, set the first byte equal to 0.  This denotes one additional level of indirection.  The first byte after the 0, labeled `length_2`, is the length of the `length` section.  The length of the `data` section is then the value of the `length` section read as an unsigned integer.\n\n&gt; [0][0][length_3][length_2][length][data]\n\nIf your number is too large for even that format, set the first two bytes equal to 0, which denotes two additional levels of indirection.  Then the value of the one-byte `length_3` section gives you the length of `length_2`, whose value gives the length of `length`, whose value gives the length of `data`.\n\n&gt; [0]^(n-1)[length_n]...[length][data]\n\nThis can be carried on indefinitely to represent arbitrarily large numbers.\n\nNote: The number 0 cannot simply be represented as `0x00` denoting a 0-length data section, since this would be interpreted as a layer of indirection; it actually has to be represented as `0x01 0x00` denoting a 1-length data section with value 0.\n\n\nSo, what's this format called?  Or do I get to name it?  If I get to name it, I'm calling it \"VLI format\" for \"Very Large Integer\".",

Alongside idolizing Knuth as a computer scientist and enjoying his writing, a lingering thought has been at the back of my head. He is 79 right now and will be at least 87 with the release of volume 5. What will happen in the event he unexpectedly dies? Will the remaining volumes be left incomplete, or will some other person be tasked with completing it? Is there anyone even capable of matching his knowledge to complete the book?",
