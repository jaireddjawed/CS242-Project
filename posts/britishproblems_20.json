        "text": "I get it... The average person apparently can't be trusted to calculate the dose of a medicinal substance based on their weight, but dosing by \"being an adult\" is equally as ridiculous.\n\nAs a 95kg male, my dose of paracetamol, sleeping tablets, antihistamines is based entirely on the fact that I'm \"age 16+\".\n\nMy wife is 55kg, and all her doses are the same.\n\nYes, as sensible adults we may make a decision to take more based on how we are affected, over the recommendation... But I'd much rather have some form of scale to tell me what's safe to take based on an _actual_ measurement instead of how many times my sack of meat has been around the sun.\n\nIt wouldn't affect suicide. If I wanted to kill myself through controlled substances, I'd just go to numerous shops. If I wanted to kill myself enough to plan properly and calculate a dose, you can be sure I'm not doing it over an agonising of 3 days through liver failure which leaves plenty of time for regret but no reversal.\n\nJust tell me how much of a medicine is \"safe\" to take based on my mass instead of age.\n\nNo, I'm not suicidal. It's just these sleeping pills are covered in \"DO NOT EVER TAKE MORE THAN THE RECOMMENDED DOSE\" warnings, when the recommended dose is the same for a 50kg female as it is a 100kg male. Which is fucking stupid.",

With high rents and low wages there are three foodbanks in the relatively small town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've volunteered at the oldest foodbank for many years and I've noticed that a couple of the volunteers are stealing some donations. They are not poor, they are retired women with houses worth in excess of ¬£800,000. I know this as one of them moved fairly recently. They don't steal much, higher valued goods like pate, sometimes it's the out of date stuff. I know they're taking them, I've seen them. If they know I've seen them they offer them to me, saying they thought the recipients wouldn't take them or they thought they'd be thrown away even though they know they are always offered to the recipients first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a single mum on benefits so I don't think I'll be believed. In fact, a volunteer was banned a few years ago for being suspected of exactly what these women are doing. The only difference was that she was not rich and she was giving the food to recipients, not taking it for herself.",
