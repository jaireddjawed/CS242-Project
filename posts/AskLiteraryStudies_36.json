        "text": "I'm currently writing a 7k word essay on appearance of chess in the Beckett Canon, focusing mostly upon how he uses the game to bridge the gap between mind and body, and dualism of metaphysical and physical worlds (as it is of the physical world, but played in the mind, so somewhat removed from it). I expect Descartes to come up a lot.  \n\n**I'm basically just throwing this out there to see if there's anything I've missed, and just to see what people's thoughts are on the appearance of chess are.**\n\nMy main points revolve around: \n\n* The arbitrary nature of the \"result\" in chess, win or lose, this doesn't matter more than playing the game. Does this reflect Beckett's general philosophy on life? Is this why he is drawn to the stalemate portrayed in *Endgame*? \n\n* The use of chess to pursue a perfect aesthetic, paying particularly attention to the unique opportunity for pattern, and disorder, that chess provides- explored at the end of *Murphy* with Endon's meticulous playing style and Murphy's failed attempt to emulate this. By extension is this a response to Beckett's growing disbelief in the ability of words to capture experience (consider, \"Words must fail\" from *Happy Days* and \"I use the words you taught me. If they don't mean anything any more, teach me others. Or let me be silent.\" from *Endgame*)\n\n* How does this respond to the motif of symmetry in Beckett, illustrated in this [post about the M pattern](http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1apfrd/the_motif_in_samuel_becketts_novels/), and indeed, within Murphy the novel- his decision to work at the Magdalen Mental Mercyseat, for example.\n\n* Chess as a provider of laboratory conditions where the writer can test, and express, the personalities of his characters and his own beliefs. \n\n**TL;DR: tell me what you think about chess in Beckett**  \n\nThanks for reading, hope it makes some semblance of sense.

I understand, like any aspect of story, magic can represent radically different aspects of a piece. But what I really want to know is why an author would make it part of their world? What does magic do for a piece that cannot be done without it?\n\nNow that I'm thinking about it more, I'm also guessing different literary traditions used magic in different ways (e.g. magic realism, medieval romance, genre fiction).

Without this metafictional reveal, we can discuss the themes of social justice, philanthropy, family values etc, but when the metafictional reveal is taken into account all of those themes are shown to be deliberately contrived.\nThis is no longer a book about philanthropy, for example, this is now a book about an author who writes a book about philanthropy.

I've seen the criticism that the literature scholar is playing the part of an amateur historian, philosopher, and political theorist. I'm also concerned that we have a misplaced value in originality in works of literature. Speaking generally, I respect the modernists for challenging form, and postmodernists for going further, but are we not moving for one paradigm to the next, re-writing stories ever more superficially without real progress? I'm finding it hard to rebuke these arguments.\n\nMoreover, I have thus far been taught that literature is innately meaningful and beautiful. I feel that I have bought into this ideology unwittingly. Now we have to consider cultural relativity which debunks these concepts. How can things have meaning if we cannot assume any structure of decoding meaning is universal? I do believe it is important to consider texts from all cultures equally but it previously stood to reason, in my mind, there was good literature and bad literature. Surely most literature students think that some works have more merit than others? So how does literary study go on? We might analyse a text as anthropological, but then we might as well study anthropology.\n\nI guess my real question is: what is the current paradigm of critique and what the mode of insight into literary works?

Ultimately, both Burgesses book and Stanley Kubrick’s film raise questions of authority and authorship in contemporary literature. The themes in and the relationship between the book and novel help us understand the post-structuralist argument that the narrative and meaning of works in discourse do not actually “belong” to the author. Some of these themes include violence, use of music, portrayal of the State, and the infamous “omitted” final chapter of A Clockwork Orange’s US edition. To better understand the context in which this postulation arises, it is imperative to first look at the philosophical works of post-structuralists such as Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes among others.\n\nthis is part of my thesis/intro.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice/tips on exactly how I should tackle this research?",

Oedipus itself can be helpful, but is rather perfunctory; the family romance essay is very genre-specific which makes it less helpful than I thought. I was also looking at cognitive theory/theory of the mind, which is attempting to incorporate family systems therapy into literary study. It wasn't so great, either.\n\nSome colleagues have suggested I look at Deleuze and Guattari. I'm interested, but it's quite a mental investment. Is this an opinion that other people share, or are there other people who I should read as well? I'd be grateful for any suggestions.\n\nThanks!",

What appeared in all four books was some kind of double loss, like the Orpheus myth. However, instead of dying twice, the first 'death' was usually replaced by something like a break-up (where 'Eurydice' leaves the protagonist, while he still lovers her) or a forbidden love (e.g. father not allowing the lovers to marry), that removed the two lovers from each other. This removal was then followed by death when the two were finally close to being reunited again, just like Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\n What makes the Orpheus myth so appealing? Why can we find so much of it in modern works that include the death of a loved one?\n\nAlso, I feel like the popularity of the Orpheus myth is very much related to Romanticism, but I don't really know the exact characteristics of Romanticism, so perhaps someone could help me with that as well?",

        "text": "**What is /r/askliterarystudies?**\n\nWe’re a subreddit where you can ask questions about literature and have them answered by people who know something about the topic. Since literary studies as a discipline is totally entangled with academia, we can also help with questions about the literary studies in higher ed, although general questions may fit better in /r/gradschool, /r/college, or /r/askacademia. \n\nYes, we are an anonymous internet forum, so you have no guarantee that the answers [are actually coming from a literary studies expert](http://imgur.com/kV4hyBk) and you should exercise your independent judgment. If your question is a complex one, nobody is going to be able to give you the final word on it in a Reddit post anyway. In general, you should think of this as a jumping off point and not your final destination. However, I think you’ll find that answers here are usually informed and productive. I’m under the impression that most of our active answerers are graduate students. \n\n**What’s the point of this post?**\n\nHere's the tl;dr, though really you should read the entire thing, especially if you are interested in answering questions. Yes, it's sort of long. I’m going to offer some guidelines on how to improve discourse here. I should begin by saying that I think the vast majority of questions and most answers here are good, and that the subreddit is functioning pretty well on the whole. The question portion lays out some suggestions about how to get better results and what constitutes acceptable homework help. The answer portion is more important because it lays out a few **changes to how the subreddit will be moderated** as well as suggestions about how you can be a better respondent. The basic rule changes: brief comments will now be deleted, there are potential consequences for vague comments, trollish posters will be banned.\n\n**What makes a question good or bad?**\n\nAlmost all questions that are posted here are good, which is no reason not to aspire for improvement. Really, the bottom line is just that you should sincerely think through your question before you post.\n\nThe most important thing is that you make it clear what you’re asking about. Respondents can’t read your mind, so be sure that you include all of the relevant details. \n\nIt’s often helpful to give your thoughts about the answer to the question. In most cases people aren’t asking about things that they are absolutely in the dark about. Writing down what you know already and what difficulties you’re facing will help respondents target their answers to where you’re at.\n\nUndergraduate homework help is an important function of this subreddit, but you should tread lightly. It’s important that your question be broad enough that it could be interesting to someone other than you. It’s important you not ask for too much. For instance, help understanding what it means to close read would be an acceptable question, where “close read this passage from *Paradise Lost* for me” is less acceptable. The latter case would be okay if you came in with some ideas, but if your question is a transparent ploy to get respondents to do significant aspects of your work for you, that’s really wack and will be deleted if it’s particularly outrageous. If you are a high school student, your question will fit better at /r/homeworkhelp in most cases.\n\n**What are the new rules that make an answer actionably bad?**\n\nThese rules apply only to top-level responses – those which respond to the post itself and not to other responses. \n\nFrom now on, very brief answers will be deleted. They’ve always been discouraged, but they’re enough of an impediment to the sub’s functioning that they shouldn’t be allowed to stand. Rather than embarking on the fool’s errand of defining the absolute boundaries of what constitutes “too brief,” I’m going it to leave it to mod discretion. A one sentence answer is definitely too brief. A one paragraph answer is almost certainly not. Posts that are dismissive or rude and don’t provide any substantive reasoning will almost always qualify. This rule doesn’t apply in situations where a one sentence answer is adequate.\n\nVague answers will not be deleted, but from now on I will RES tag you if I notice you giving vague answers. If it’s a persistent problem, I will message you to warn you, and then delete vague answers from you in the future. I’m not aware that there’s anyone frequently writing vague answers right now – although I don’t currently tag people – but vague answers are bad contributions and I want to do more to discourage them. The most common type of vague answer would be one with a number of abstractions not backed up with an example, though again, this is at mod discretion. When in doubt, give an example, and you’re sure to be okay.\n\nPeople who consistently post asinine things will be banned. By this, I mean trollishly rude or dismissive responses. Currently the system works and these sorts of comments are usually downvoted, but there’s no good reason to keep people around who are incessantly childish. \n\nIn a perfect world, this subreddit would be all signal, no noise. That will never be the case, but I think that these reforms will only increase the amount of signal. I’m happy to hear and respond to feedback about these rules, as well as to listen to additional suggestions. If you feel that active modding is inherently tyrannical, our discussion will not get very far, but I really don’t want posters to feel like mod powers are being used in an arbitrary manner. \n\nIf in a specific case you think that a deletion is unfair, we can discuss that when the time comes. I ask that you assume that the mods are acting in good faith even if you disagree with particular decisions. Don’t come out swinging.\n\nWhen I write that rules will be applied at mod discretion, it’s implied that this discretion will be within reasonable limits. I have chosen not to elaborate further to discourage rules lawyering, the curse of internet moderators everywhere. \n\nOh, and keep in mind that there are only a few of us, so enforcement cannot be consistently timely. If a brief response has led to a discussion that relies on the context of the post by the time the mods arrive, it will not be deleted, since stripping discussions of context is not worth it. On the other hand, if a brief response has garnered upvotes but generated no discussion, it will likely be deleted, since an important part of this is using the stick to incentivize better answers.\n\n**What else makes answers bad?**\n\nTo my mind, the most destructive answers are basically correct but very shallow answers posted early in a thread’s existence. These kinds of answers discourage others from posting similar responses, and don’t get critiqued because they’re not wrong. They are helpful, but only minimally so. Many of these posts read as if they’re written by people who do not know very much about the subject that they’re writing about. You are strongly encouraged to exercise your judgment. If you don’t know much about a field, don’t answer just because you think you can kinda sorta help OP. These kinds of answers are not really destructive after a post has been sitting around for a while – at that point a shoddy answer may be better than no answer – but for the first sixteen hours or so you ought to restrain yourself to see if people with more knowledge in the field can answer. I don’t think these kinds of posts can be effectively modded without discouraging participation in a bad way, but I encourage everyone to ask for elaboration on these kinds of answers and judiciously use downvotes. I’d love to hear more about what the community thinks can be done about these kind of responses.\n\nThere are occasionally but rarely answers that are factually quite iffy. The mods should not sit in judgment over the truth of every post, so we will not delete these even if we are confident that they’re wrong. I encourage anyone who thinks the facts of a post are questionable to post a correction if you know better or ask for sources if you don't. There are good reasons why sources are not required for all posts here, unlike certain similar subreddits. However, in cases that seem factually off, if you ask for sources and the poster can’t provide any, it shows everyone that their response is extremely questionable.\n\n**What makes answers good?**\n\nGood answers are detailed and demonstrate real knowledge of the subject. Longer is usually better, but concision is also key. They should be written with minimal jargon and comprehensible to your average interested college sophomore. They should not assume much knowledge, but they should also not be condescending. Even when you’re in dialogue with somebody who seems knowledgeable, it’s helpful if you make your conversation clear enough that my imaginary sophomore could understand. Citing sources or offering suggestions for academic books where one might pursue the question further is excellent. \n\nI highly encourage posters with knowledge on the subject to affirm good responses. We’re the rare subreddit where the equivalent of a “this” is usually acceptable. \n\nLet’s take a look at [this recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/2z50es/is_the_academia_interested_in_electronic/) that has a nice cross-section of response quality. There are three replies to OP. Two are single sentence answers that offer no elaboration about why those particular books or people would be useful. One answer is technically not even a response to OP’s question, since OP asks for “articles or books” and someone responds by naming a person without saying anything about what her work is about or which of her seven books are particularly topical or interesting. Going forward, that would be deleted. The follow up answer there on Kirschenbaum is more interesting and fine, but it would be better with more detail. The other top-level answer suggests books but says nothing about them. It’s on the borderline between being too brief and being permissible because naming books more or less satisfies OP’s question. I would probably not delete it, but it’s pretty inadequate.\n\nOn the other hand, /u/MilsonBartleby’s response is just superb. They offer a chatty but informative rundown of several books that OP might be interested in, giving OP more than enough to pursue the subject. It’s not a heavyweight answer in terms of offering academic arguments or summaries of the books, but in fact that suits OP’s question better than a denser response would have. Then, when asked a follow up question, /u/MilsonBartleby again hits it out of the park. This time, OP has asked a question that requires more detailed info about one of the books, and the response articulately both answers OP’s question and elaborates on other places he might look for writing on the topic. \n\nI’m happy to field questions and criticism. I’m open to modifying these shifts for compelling reasons. However, I encourage folks to keep an open mind to see if moderation can raise the quality of discourse.",

Transformation - \"...the system is not static...new material is always being structured by the system.\"  \n3.

I have failed to find any other references to it anywhere else, so I wonder if the anecdote was a product of my professor's imagination. It goes more or less like this:\n\nTowards the end of his life, Victor Hugo had become celebrity in France. On his birthday (or maybe not), the french government decided to invite all the foreign ambassadors in France to an official event to celebrate Victor Hugo's birthday. At the reception, all the guests stood in line, waiting to greet Hugo. Upon being greeted by each ambassador, Hugo would respond with a one-liner about a particular achievement from their country (e.g., upon meeting the ambassador of Greece he said \"Oh Greece! The birthplace of Democracy\", or something to that effect). He manages to deliver one-liners to each and every ambassador that comes to greet him. However, towards the end of the reception, he is greeted by the ambassador of Burkina Faso (or Burundi, or some other obscure african country) and struggles to think of an adequate response. Eventually he comes up with a perfect one: \"Oh, Burkina Faso! Oh, L'Humanité!\".\n\nHas anyone heard this anecdote before? Or was my professor making this story up? Cheers.",

Of course, little things get through while they iron out the creases - like the cushion that reads FAITH. Yet Atwood doesn't address this passage:\n\nWe turn in at a more modern building, a huge banner draped over its door — WOMEN'S PRAYVAGANZA TODAY. The banner covers the building's former name, some dead president they shot. Below the red writing there's a line of smaller print, in black, with the outline of a winged eye on either side of it: God Is a National Resource.\n\nSurely this cannot be mere oversight by the Republic (although it may well be oversight by the author). I'm minded to think, maybe it is because there is no symbol to represent those words... Nonetheless the open question is, why, why did the Republic allow those words to be read at a women specific event?",

        "text": "My (admittedly limited) academic exposure to the field would suggest that \"death of the author\" is the one of the prevailing mindsets of contemporary literary analysis. However when applied to online serial fiction it seems potentially problematic. \n\nWriter of the in-progress, fan-fiction serial web-novel [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,](http://hpmor.com/) Eliezer Yudkowsky (/u/eliezeryudkowsky,) has been actively inserting himself into the discussion of his work. This has obviously colored the interpretation and criticism of the novel. \n\nA recent (possibly intentionally misleading) post by the author regarding the interpretation of the latest chapters [not linked due to potential spoilers] have led me to ask these questions. At this point in the story, the reading that seems most internally consistent with the text itself as we have it runs counter to the author's recent statement. \n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Can \"Death of the Author\" apply to works that are not yet finished?\n\n* Is it reasonable to attempt any serious analysis of a piece that is incomplete?\n\n* Should the way we respond to a work of fiction be shaped by the fact that a large part of the public interaction with that work is occurring in a space where the author now frequents?\n\nThank you for your considered responses to these questions.

As a English major who is just beginning to be introduced to certain theoretical discourses, I'm running into a bit of a conundrum when looking at deconstructionist readings of literary works.\n\nCurrently, what I've read on deconstruction implies that it is heavily dependent upon other modes of analysis and is not self-contained in the way some psychoanalytical or Marxist theories are. In discussion with an acquaintance, he mentioned that structuralism is, in reality, deconstructing literature, whereas deconstruction is taking the basic elements that structuralism breaks literature down to and builds them anew in order to disrupt binaries. However, a lot of the examples of deconstructionist criticism I've read (e.g. Lois Tyson) will insist on branching out even further from structuralism/deconstruction, often pulling from another discipline all together (e.g. New Criticism) and using that as fuel for a deconstructionist reading of a work.\n\nSo, is deconstructionism dependent on others as heavily as I am led to believe? Do I need to be able to deeply understand a text in a new critical, feminist, new historicist, etc. manner in order to provide a detailed analysis through the lens of deconstruction?",
