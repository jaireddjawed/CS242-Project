        "text": "Sup fam? As a English-speaking American male I often speak differently to other males. This is typified by a simplified and formulaic form of English rampant with slang and idioms, and sentences seem to both begin and end with male terms of endearment (bro, bruh, man, dude, etc). It's even coupled with a change in body language. When I use this \"language\" is context driven and automatic. For example, I only use it with peers and what seems to me people I'm *testing* to see if they are peers, and I slip right into it without thinking. I never speak this way to females (except overtly homosexual females), superiors (bosses, parents, older people etc), and to \"inferiors\" (children, people I have authority over) I either don't or use a very water-down version of it. In fact, it feels weird to me when one of these groups tries to use that language with me. So anyway, I'm wondering if anyone has insight into this phenomenon from scientific point of views. Both characterizing the patterns linguistically, and why it occurs. I assume it's a group cohesion dynamic, but I'm just interested in learning more about it. In particular, I'm interested in why this language sometimes seems to be used as a *test* as I've noticed it becomes more intense when used with strangers. Also, I assume females have a corresponding peer-driven intra-gender linguistic dynamic too so if anyone has insight on that I'd in that as well. Since this is Reddit after all please note this is just something I'm interested in, and I'm being honest in my description, but statements shouldn't be taken as normative positions. Na'mean? ",

        "author": "Markdd8",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/8yn5lo/how_does_social_science_view_the_value_and/",
        "text": "At the outset one can observe that there is considerable sentiment that: \n\n1) A great deal of crime and deviance stems from root causes (e.g., poverty, poor schools, racism), and \n\n2) In a just society, crime levels would fall dramatically and many remaining offenses could be dealt with by counseling and restorative justice (reconciliation between criminal and victim).\n\n - - - -\n\nPutting these perspectives aside, how does Social Science view the primary modes of punishment?  Methods used outside the U.S. and historic methods also listed. Observations follow some categories.\n\nBecause of the breadth of this topic, discussion on punishment and \"general deterrence\" is excluded (a much debated topic.)  The focus is on the allied goals of punishment to 1) impose retribution on the offender and 2) deter that person from engaging in more crime (\"specific deterrence\").\n\n1)  *Fines*  Many poor people are unable to pay them.\n\n2)  *Prison* A strong justification here is that even if imprisonment is deemed a faulty mode, it has an incapacitation function: *Criminals can't commit more crime while they are locked up.*\n\n3) *Other Confinement Options*   Home arrest with an electronic bracelet is one.  High tech offers a large expansion of this method in coming decades (offenders with bracelets being allowed to roam--within limits--in society).\n\n  ------- The above are the 3 dominant punishment modes in the U.S.\n\n4)  *Forced labor*  Part of the thinking here is that prisoners defray the cost of their keep.  This method is seen as open to much abuse (e.g. chain gangs in the southern U.S.)\n\n5) *Public Ostracism*  Example:  The 17th century practice of putting offenders in stocks in the village square overnight.  Ostracism is mostly absent from the U.S., though some communities place photos of prostitution *johns*  (arrested) in newspapers.\n\n6)  *Exile*  (known as *Transportation* in British history) Impractical in today's world.\n\n7) *Execution*\n\n8) *Punishing a criminal's family*  In traditional societies, a requirement that a criminal compensate the victim by making payment, sometimes in animals, could adversely affect the criminal's family.  Punishment on families can be much more direct, e.g.,  Israel demolishing homes of (so-called) terrorists.\n\n9)  *Corporal punishment/flogging.*  Regarded as unacceptable in U.S. but used in some cultures.  Offenders are often released upon completion of punishment--a sharp contrast to the outcome of imprisonment, which can subject offenders to years of harsh confinement.  An *Economist* book review (very well written) on the topic brings an interesting perspective.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/06/23/sing-sing-or-the-lash\n\nAppreciate in particular discussion on the point raised is this link:  Is it preferable to imprison people for years as opposed to corporal punishment?  Obviously it is not an either/or choice, but the point is worthwhile.\n\nExcerpt:  \"The modern American prison system evolved as an alternative to flogging....\"\n\nDiscussion point: If we don't flog and in the future we elect to largely dispense with prisons--as some have suggested--what are we left with?  Fining poor people seems impractical.\n",

        "author": "Gecatto",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/8vwkg2/question_regarding_four_dimensions_of_power/",
        "text": "So I'm reading Wolf's *Figurar el poder* (english: *Envisioning Power. Ideologies of Dominance and Crisis*) and I can't get my head around the four ways he lists in which 'power intertwines in social relations'. I get first and second, but third and fourth are described in too vague a way for me that I can't differentiate with precision. I feel I could kind of explain by repeating the definition more or less, but I am incapable of then saying what's the difference exactly. Which means I don't understand really :DCould anyone help me with that? Examples would be really welcome - I've tried to think on situations that might help me differentiate, but it's been for nothing.\n\n\\[Edit: so, trying to grasp its sense, maybe I could see the third one as power that marks the context/arena (its limits), and the fourth as the one that not only can create such limits but also sets the terms in which this arena works. I'm not sure.\\]\n\nAlso, if you don't mind, could you clarify if Wolf sees this kind of classification as different types of power (being mutually exclusive of each other) of rather like dimensions that can be observed in a same situation?\n\nHere the paragraph in the book (from the english version):\n\n*\"I have found it useful to distinguish among four modalities in how power is thus woven into social relations. One is the power of potency or capability that is seen to inhere in an individual. Power in this Nietzschean sense draws attention to how persons enter into a play of power, but it does not address what that play is about. A second kind of power is manifested in interactions and transactions among people and refers to the ability of an ego to impose its will in social action upon an alter (the Weberian view). Left unspecified is the nature of the arena in which these interactions go forward. A third modality is power that controls the contexts in which people exhibit their capabilities and interact with others. This sense calls attention to the instrumentalities through which individuals or groups direct or circumscribe the actions of others within determinate settings. I refer to this mode as tactical or organizational power.*\n\n*But there is still a fourth modality of power, which I want to focus on in the present inquiry: structural power. By this I mean the power manifest in relationships that not only operates within settings and domains but also organizes and orchestrates the settings themselves, and that specifies the direction and distribution of energy flows. In Marxian terms, this refers to the power to deploy and allocate social labor. vIt is also the modality of power addressed by Michel Foucault when he spoke of \"governance,\" to mean the exercise of\"action upon action\" (1984, 42728). \\[...\\]\"*\n\nI should clarify I'm not going to read the whole thing, but rather I'm looking for a conceptualization of 'power' and 'ideology' as a theoretical frame for a uni exercise.\n\nThanks a lot :)",

Whether it's in their maturity (not something that can be measured I suppose but any indicators?) or in all sorts of mental abilities of whatever kind? \n\nSomething that struck me was that the kids I personally know today have from a very young age an ability to simply pull out a tablet or their parents phones and type away, play all sorts of games (usually apps) and watch all sorts of videos on youtube. Along with this comes greater accessibility to a ridiculous amount of content whether it's an answer to their fleeting curiosities of all imaginative kinds as well as other types of content typically tailored to mature audiences, this can all be stumbled on by accident too. Whereas *back in my day* I had a handful of simple cartoons and books and that's quite literally it. So I don't doubt that a young child today might stumble upon more by the age of 10 than I did by the age of say 15. That hypothetical  5 year gap can surely make an incredible difference to their future\n\nI think I've come across suggestions that hand-eye coordination is probably sharper, but other than that what are some real differences or the predictions at least? I've done a google search and it feels like many of the sites I've come across are more geared towards pop science but I could be unnecessarily critical in that.\n\nThanks\n\n",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I was recently interested in the atrocities committed in Africa during the scramble, and maybe the most prominent of them all is the genocide of Herero and Nama people in today's Namibia by Imperial Germany which caused the death of some 120.000 people. As far as I can tell from my research, the genocide is well documented and is not disputed except for some denialists.\n\nNow, what I am trying to understand is that when we look at today's Germany, we see a liberal democratic country respecting and promoting human rights, however I think there are some inconsistencies in how they approach the Namibian Genocide. I will explain:\n\nFirstly, the genocide was outright denied/ignored until 2004. The German Chancellor, during his visits in January 2004, in Africa, skipped Namibia, who was commemorating the hundred year anniversary of the massacres which were done in 1904, ignoring the events all together. Later in July 2004, German Minister of Economic Cooperation visited Namibia, and gave a speech where she expressed guilt in behalf of Germany, however she avoided an explicit apology, and did not used the word \"apology\". When she was asked to do so, she said that her entire speech could be considered as one (1). However, this statement was received with harsh criticism back in Germany (1), and German parliament after these events ruled that this speech consisted of purely personal remarks and did not represent the official government policy (2).\n\nSecondly, some ten years later, in 2015, when a delegation from Namibia was visiting Germany to discuss the return of remains of victims such as skulls and bones which where exported from Namibia for racial examination, German parliamentary speaker said that if assessed by today's standards, the atrocities was definitely a genocide (3). However it was later added that since genocide was only made a punishable crime in 1948, German actions did not constitute a crime back in 1904, ruling out any possibility of financial reparations (2). \n\nFurther, any attempts by Namibian officials to demand reparations was answered with statements, which some of them in my opinion, almost resembling threats. They claimed that such a discussion of reparations would hurt the \"good bilateral relations\" between two governments which arguably would risk the international aid Namibia is receiving (2).\n\nI cannot understand why a country such as Germany that has billions of euros of budget surplus every year would do these kind of things to not to pay reparations. I mean, yes they maybe are right that international law doesn't coerce them to pay reparations, but I think this is a case of \"you are not wrong, you are just an a**hole\" situation and I really can't understand why they are refusing to pay. I do not see a problem financially, the sum to be paid could not possibly hurt the economy of a giant that is Germany. Will it hurt their international prestige and stance? I would say the opposite, that this kind of approach should hurt it, and paying the reparations would only reinforce Germany's image as a liberal country.\n\nAs a Turkish person, I can understand my government denying Armenian genocide, they are a bunch of illiberal backward shitheads, and certainly there are other Turkish people like me who accept the genocide and ready to do what is necessary. But I cannot understand why Germany is doing this. Isn't this a hypocritical and ethically wrong stance to take?\n\nI am only an undergraduate student in political science, who is not so familiar with neither Germany's nor Namibia's internal politics. This question is also only a result of reading three/four articles about the topic from JSTOR, so I am also worried that my sources could be biased. I am currently on mobile, so sorry for any mistakes. I will also upload the source articles when I am back on a computer soon.\n\nThanks for any help with my question and I would also appreciate any suggestions if there is a better subreddit to ask this question. \n\nSources: \n\n(1) How to Come to Terms with the Past: Re-Visiting the German Colonial Genocide in\nNamibia, Henning Meller (2005)\n\n(2) The return of Herero and Nama bones from Germany: the victims’ struggle\nfor recognition and recurring genocide memories in Namibia, in *Human Remains in Society*, Vilho Amukwaya Shigwedha (2016)\n\n(3) http://www.ibtimes.com/german-official-says-namibia-herero-killings-were-genocide-part-race-war-2000764\n\nEdit: Added sources and fixed some typos.

Quick background, I am a gay man, and the words \"social construct\" get thrown around a lot in LGBT circles. I am not a psych expert, but I am curious to learn more about sociology and what people mean when they use the term social construct, especially in relation to topics such as what type of people you are sexually attracted too.\n\nAn example of the above statement that I have heard is when asked \"what type of guys do you go after.\" I respond with \"I like masculine guys\" and sometimes get a response like \"That is a stupid thing to say, Masculinity is just a social construct.\" In the context of the sentence, I take it to mean that masculinity isn't real, and therefore me being attracted to masculine men is all in my head. Is this the case?\n\nAlso curious to how this works with race in relation to social construct. A statement like \"I don't find myself to be attracted to Asian facial features\" gets met with \"race is just a social construct.\" I take it to mean that all the races look the same, and therefore Asian facial features aren't real.   Is this what people mean by race being a social construct, or is it more stereotypes based on race, such as Asians can't drive, or are good at math?\n\nAnyone care to educate me on this? Any kind of insight you can give, especially when it comes to sexual attraction, and what people could or could not find attractive in a partner.\n\nThanks!",
