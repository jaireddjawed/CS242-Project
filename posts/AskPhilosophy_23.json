        "text": "Hello to everybody. My question concerns the terms essence and nature. Does spinoza uses them interchangeably or are they are slightly different? My feeling is that the latter is true, but I am not sure, even though throughout the second part of Ethics it appears that the former is true. Still, my understanding of the text makes them appear slightly different for some reason. A clue towards my interpretation can be found in Stanford encyclopaedia of Philosophy and it states that \"a thing's essence may not be equivalent to its nature for spinoza\" and then it points to proposition 11 from part 1 of Ethics. But I'm not sure that that clue is enough.\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

So, as asked in the title, how far back (after Spinoza) can the term 'affect' be traced and to whom? (Before I am just reading \\*what would eventually be used in the concept of affect\\*).",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10k7p1d/martin_buber_good_and_evil_being_presence_and_the/",
        "text": "Here is an extract from near the end of Good and Evil by Martin Buber. I realise the extract is quite long. I have bolded the elements I am confused by. You can see he outlines how animals are already consumed with being, but humans are caught in tension between what is and what is not due to our capacity for thought and imagination. We are not readily 'this-being' but require affirmations of how we sit in the world from others and from ourselves to avoid being mislead by our own mind's illusions. He goes on to say that a man can affirm his own being, however, 'in a pinch' if his own confirmation 'reaches such a pitch it no longer needs to be supplanted'. To me this sounds understandable as acceptance of reality as it is, and avoiding getting trapped in the mind and dwelling on what isn't, denying reality.\n\nWhat confuses me is what he has called 'the third process'. The one that accepts all that is as it is. \"one need no longer look for being, it is here, one is what one wants and one wants what one is already is how he defines this undesirable state. He likens it to Yima who lost his immortality when demons flattered him into believing he himself had created himself and his own good works, at which point Yima immediately became mortal.\n\nI am confused because I thought I understood the experience he was referencing as something like 'presence', being in the moment by accepting what is as it is. Basically, ego death and mindfulness as an experience of God or pure being, realising that all is one. I understood Yima's fall as being the return of ego. But when he describes the third process as a sort of radical acceptance and categorises it as negative, I feel like my understanding is contradicted.\n\nAny help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Because man is the sole living creature known to us in whom the category of possibility is so to speak embodied, and whose reality is incessantly enveloped by possibilities, he alone amongst them all needs confirmation. **Every animal is fixed in its this-being, its modifications are preordained, and when it changes into a caterpillar and into a chrysalis its very metamorphosis is a boundary; in everything together it remains exactly what it is, therefore it can need no confirmation; it would, indeed, be an absurdity for someone to say to it, or for it to say to itself: You may be what you are.** Man as man is an audacity of life, undetermined and unfixed; **he therefore requires confirmation**, and he can naturally only receive this as individual man, in that others **and he himself confirm him in his being-this-man**. Again and again the Yes must be spoken to him, from the look of the confidant and from the stirrings of his own heart, to liberate him from the dread of abandonment, which is a foretaste of death. **At a pinch, one can do without confirmation from others if one's own reaches such a pitch that it no longer needs to be supplemented by the confirmation of others**. But not vice versa: the encouragement of his fellow-men does not suffice if self-knowledge demands inner rejection, for self-knowledge is incontestably the more reliable. Then man, if he cannot readjust his self-knowledge by his own conversion, must withdraw from it the power over the Yes and No; **he must render affirmation independent of all findings and base it, instead of on 'judgement-of-oneself, on a sovereign willing-oneself; he must choose himself, and that not 'as he is intended' this image must, rather, be totally extinguished but just as he is, as he has himself resolved to intend himself.** They are recognisable, those who dominate their own self-knowledge, by the spastic pressure of the lips, the spastic tension of the muscles of the hand and the spastic tread of the foot. This attitude corresponds to **what I have called the third process**, which leads out of auto-problematics 'into the open': **one need no longer look for being, it is here, one is what one wants and one wants what one is**. It is of this that the myth is speaking when it recounts that Yima proclaimed himself his own creator. Just this too Prudentius reports of Satan, and the great legendary motif of the pact with him is clearly derived from the view that he who has achieved self-creation will be ready to assist men to it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From this point, the meaning of that paradoxical myth of the two spirits, one of whom chose evil, not without knowing it to be evil, but as evil, is also revealed to us. The 'wicked\\* spirit in whom, therefore, evil is already present, if only in stotu nascendi -has to choose between the two affirmations: affirmation of himself and affirmation of the order, which has established and eternally establishes good and evil, the first as the affirmed and the second as the denied. If he affirms the order he must himself become 'good', and that means he must deny and overcome his present state of being. If he affirms himself he must deny and reverse the order; to the yes-position, which 'good' had occupied, **he must bring the principle of his own self affirmation, nothing else must remain worthy of affirmation than just that which is affirmed by him; his Yes to himself determines the reason and right of affirmation**. If he still concedes any significance to the concept 'good', it is this: precisely that which I am. He has chosen himself, and nothing, no quality and no destiny, can any longer be signed with a No if it is his.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This too explains altogether why Yima's defection is called a lie. By glorifying and blessing himself as his own creator, he commits the lie against being, yea, he wants to raise it, the lie, to rule over being, for truth shall no longer be what he experiences as such but what he ordains as such. The narrative of Yima's life after his defection says with super-clarity all that remains to be said",

Their definitions of freedom are diametric opposites in that one understands freedom as being about 'relation' to something larger, and the other is about finding freedom in spite of something larger i.e Camus' rebellion.\n\nAs I evaluate them, I'm just not sure which one is better because I cannot decide which ones understanding of freedom is 'freer'. I understand that freedom, according to religion, is about living in accordance with who God has made us to be and thus obeying commandments as best we can, but this can create obvious restriction i.e how do we know which commandments are right. On the other hand, I recognise that we may need an objective other to ground ourselves in.\n\nCan people please recommend any good papers, articles etc to help me wrap my hand around what a good sustainable definition of freedom ought to be as I evaluate them? many thanks.",

        "text": "As proposed by Tom Clark. Here's his (very brief argument) - \n\n1) It is a mundane, although contingent, fact of life that when I die other subjects exist, hence subjectivity certainly is immune to my death in these circumstances.\n\n2) If I am unconscious for any length of time I don't experience that interval; I am always \"present\"; this is personal subjective continuity.\n\n3) If, after a period of unconsciousness, the transformed person who wakes up is not me there still won't be any perceived gap in awareness. The person who wakes up feels, as I did (hence \"still\" feels), that they've always been present. There has been no prior experience of not being present for them, nor when I stop existing do I have such an experience; this is generic subjective continuity.\n\n4) Death and birth are \"functionally equivalent\" to the sort of transformation in 3), so again there will be no perceived gap, no nothingness of non-experience into which the subject might fall.\n\n5) Generic subjective continuity holds across any objective discontinuities in the existence of conscious beings.\ncessation.\n\nHe expands on this basic formulation in this article :\n https://www.naturalism.org/philosophy/death/death-nothingness-and-subjectivity \n\n(below is just a small extract)\n\nIn proposing this I don't mean to suggest that there exist some supernatural, death-defying connections between consciousnesses which could somehow preserve elements of memory or personality. This is not at all what I have in mind, since material evidence suggests that everything a person consists of--a living body, awareness, personality, memories, preferences, expectations, etc.--is erased at death. Personal subjective continuity as I defined it above requires that experiences be those of a particular person; hence, this sort of continuity is bounded by death. So when I say that you should look forward, at death, to the \"subjective sense of always having been present,\" I am speaking rather loosely, for it is not you--not this set of personal characteristics--that will experience \"being present.\" Rather, it will be another set of characteristics (in fact, countless sets) with the capacity, perhaps, for completely different sorts of experience. But, despite these (perhaps radical) differences, it will share the qualitatively very same sense of always having been here, and, like you, will never experience its cessation.\n\nWhat are the arguments against these kinds of ideas (if there even are any?)",

There is a 14 year old girl named Ellie who is immune to Cordyceps for some reason.\n\n•A doctor believes that he can cure the fungus by studying Ellie\n\n•She is escorted to him by a man named Joel. Unfortunately, once they arrive, Joel finds out that due to the nature of the procedure, in the process of creating a cure, Ellie will be killed. \n\n•Despite the fact that the resulting cure could potentially save many people, this doesn’t sit right will Joel, so he goes in guns blazing and saves her from certain death. \n\n**Factors that might be relevant:**\n\n- Joel doesn’t have a grand, well thought out ethical reason for doing what he does. He saves Ellie because he loves her and she has become like a daughter to him in the time they spent together. \n\n- Ellie does not know that the procedure will kill her. She was not informed of this before being put under, and did not consent to it.\n\n- Joel has to kill multiple other people in order to save her from certain death",

I have posted this question on r/existentialism, but I have gotten few responses and would appreciate more diversity of opinions here.\n\n I don't intend for this to be a 'self-help' question, I just want to understand how Sartre might have conceptualized social anxiety and if his ideas could lead to any reprieve for sufferers. I want to propose my own interpretation of Sartre to others in order to revise or improve my understanding, as I have only recently begun delving into his works.\n\nI am currently reading *Being &amp; Nothingness.* Sartre's notion of our radical and undeniable freedom has begun to influence how I perceive my behavior. In Part 1, he describes how we impose our own meaning on the world and sense of obligation/duty; for instance, an alarm clock sound is not inherently urgent, but we impose that sense of urgency upon it.\n\nI wonder if this could have implications for our relations with other people. Especially in our modern age, there is so much implicit pressure to be validated by the crowd. Could a Sartrean perspective possibly help someone break free from social anxiety? Please don't qualify this as a 'self-help' question, but I am particularly drawn to this application of his philosophy because I do suffer with the condition myself, and it is interfering with my daily life. However, I don't just want to bend Sartre to get what I 'want' out of his philosophy, I want to know if there is some legitimate means of interpreting him to help individuals break free from fear of others' judgments.\n\nKind regards.",

Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s the terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and  ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have  personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror  way beyond falling.\" - David foster Wallace (an excerpt from the book \"Infinite Jest\")",

This question for us *Amateures* who can't take the traditional Philosophy rout, but aspire nonetheless to develop robust Philosophy.\n\nIn this decade, doesn't it seems Amateures may have a shot being as skilled as Professionals?\n\nI define Amateure Philosopher as that \"*Philosopher*\" who doesn't works in academic institution. \n\n------------\n\n*Environment:* Thanks to Internet, there's quite a lot of Philosophy spaces where you can discuss, debate, get constructive criticism and sharpen your critical skills. \n\nYou can spend hours with informative people online. Let alone the Reading/Study Groups.\n\n*Learning Material :* There's already an abundance of material for Philosophy available. E.g., online courses, books, videos, etc.\n \n*Instruction :* More importantly, a lot of graduates will be more than happy to review and discuss your works. You can find pretty decent PhDs offering 1-1. Developing relations w/ them can provide you with longterm supervision.\n\n*Cons :*\n\n- Requires a lot of self-discipline. But, IMO, is less stressful, too. \n- Sure, you will miss studying under the leading german scholar of Neitzche. But.. who says its also not gauranteed everything you like will go well in the traditional rout.\n\n-----------\n\nThus, assuming you have the financial security, discipline, and the time: With much less financial cost, isn't it possible to be equally skilled Philosopher as the Academic ones, w/o taking the traditional rout?",

Then how to apply those knowledge practically (in business, politics, healthcare) and philosophically (from what we then know, how do we approach abstract concepts like love, morality and spirituality). \n\nYou can replace the term \"human body\" with any other idea I may find myself curious about.\n\nThe sequence/order in which I connect and relate various fields can also be interchanged.\n\nI'm not great at articulating what it really is that I want so I tend to beat around the bush.\n\nI guess one way to put it is I want to see things as close to their essence/root level as possible. And to understand them enough to efficiently base my daily life and decisions upon what I know.\n\nAmong the few things that sparked this desire is my personal experience. I have struggled with my mental health and in my attempt to alleviate the difficulties by researching &amp; reflecting, I've concluded how truly complex things can be, and how relevant that can be in terms of affecting someone/something. \n\nI overthink a lot, so I figured that maybe by putting structure in my thoughts with proper logical reasoning (Philosophy) and a better grasp of how things around me really work (Science), I can avoid entertaining negative thoughts that originate from biased thinking and a false perspective of the world's real nature. \n\nAlso, it's just purely elating seeing beyond the surface of how things seem to be.

In this new\n\nera we humans are overwhelmingly dominant in terms of the biological and even chemical\n\nfuture of this planet. We are geoengineering the Earth already in a whole host of ways, from\n\nreducing the pH of the oceans to depleting the genetic diversity of life and thereby foreclosing\n\npossible future evolutionary pathways. Most obviously we have shifted half a trillion tonnes of\n\ncarbon from the planet’s rocks into the atmosphere and oceans. And since the invention of the\n\nHaber-Bosch process in 1912 humans have been the only species along with Rhizobium\n\nbacteria that are able to fix nitrogen directly from the atmosphere.\n\nWe are changing the geographic location of the major biomes via climate change and\n\nimpounding massive amounts of new freshwater on land behind dams, as well as raising the\n\nlevels of the seas by melting down the ice caps. So in summary, not geoengineering is not an\n\noption in actual fact because we are already doing it. The only two choices we have are whether\n\nto be intelligent geoengineers or to continue being unintelligent ones. And I worry that the\n\nunintended outcome of much of the conventional environmental narrative will be to push us\n\ntowards the latter rather than the former position. People are understandably nervous of the\n\nhubris implied in us being the ‘God Species’. But I do not see any realistic alternative. Either\n\nwe recognise the enormity of our impacts and seek to address them sensibly or we lapse into a\n\nkind of comforting denial.\n\nOne example of this is the role played by aerosols in the atmosphere. There was a paper in\n\nPNAS just this week suggesting that Chinese sulphur emissions from coal-burning have\n\nrestrained global warming over the last decade. All-told, aerosols may be shaving a degree even\n\noff temperatures, like a constant ongoing volcanic eruption. Because of smog and the health\n\neffects these have I would expect them to gradually be removed as economies develop and\n\npeople demand cleaner air. But that will add straight away to global warming. So why not\n\nmove the sulphate sunshade from the troposphere to the stratosphere, where no-one has to\n\nbreathe it and it can continue to mitigate global temperature rise? This of course raises real\n\ngovernance issues which may be next to impossible to solve, but it is a real decision\n\nnonetheless. I don’t see why an accidental geoengineering decision is necessarily going to\n\ndeliver a better global outcome than an intentional considered one.",

It's more that I want to develop my ability to talk about ideas, form arguments and write in a compelling way. I've spent lots of time in isolation (not covid related, just lonely and friendless for most of my 20's) and really struggle to converse with people. My housemate last year was quite smart and could chew your ear off. Often I would just not engage or simply nod and agree because I couldn't keep up with her or structure my thoughts well, and this made me very depressed, and feeling dumb. But when I'm alone, maybe going for a walk I can really get a dialogue going with myself where I dive into big ideas. My favourite moments are in contemplation of how jawdroppingly incredible life is! So I guess I want to develop the skills to communicate. \n\nIm thinking about an arts degree and possibly going further, but I'm hesitant. I think hearing jordan peterson talk down on the humanities makes me feel embarrassed to go for it.\n\nWith my current situation study would be through an online open university. I would like a degree, if only to feel some kind of achievement.\n\nOtherwise there's self study. But i feel very overwhelmed and dont know where to start. I would just really appreciate having access to some kind of structure on how to approach this. I'm unsure but I honestly believe I could make some kind of contribution in my life.

        "author": "Imanuellycan",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10itlrl/the_relationship_between_philosophy_and_biography/",
        "text": "Nietzsche said that “every great philosophy so far has been: namely, the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir.” I am wondering how should one regard the philosophers whose professed positions in their writings and teachings go against their own experiences? And if we were to make anything out of this, how should we read the philosophy of such philosopher in light of their biographical experiences? \n\nNow, this question may sound strange and even absurd, but my reasoning for asking it is the following. First, there are philosophers who stake their individual experiences as such against the entire history of philosophy, for example Kierkegaard’s rejection of the universal ethic for the singular individual through faith. And it is clear that either/or itself is in the style of biographies, with plenty of hints that parts of it are taken from Kierkegaard’s own life. If we were to taken into account of the form of the text and it’s biographical features, and that biographical experiences can shape one’s philosophical understanding, then it seems natural to ask if this biographical aspect is crucial to interpreting the text (although I am aware of the complexity of the example that I invoked, given also that Either/Or is written in pseudonym) \n\nSecond, for those philosophers who have been particularly scandalous because of their biographical accounts, how should we interpret their philosophy? The easiest example that comes to my mind is Heidegger. And indeed there has been plenty of controversies surrounding the interpretation of Heidegger’s work and its relation to nazism. But if we were to read Heidegger’s non-political work in relation to his Nazism (and make out of them, for example, fascist tendencies) then what justifies such connection, and must we not, also, extend this method to the reading of those other philosophers whose philosophy does not involve or contradict their actions? For example, can we not read Adorno in this same way when he refuses to join the student protests against the Vietnam War, or when Deleuze failing to participate in any of the risk taking activities that he advocated in Anti-Oedipus? Or even Marx, whose biography itself contradicts so much with his written corpus? Does this kind of reading only apply selectively, maybe only the most extreme case of conservatism or fascism? The latter seems to be the case, for example, when Bloom’ interpretation of Plato were dismissed by Nussbaum not just on the ground of textual evidence but also mostly due to his conservative and antifeminist conclusions, or when many refuses to engage with Schmidt because of his conclusions. And what prevents us, if any, to go even a step further and take into account of the other aspects of the philosopher’s life as well? For example, can we regard the numerous sexual harassment scandals committed by individual philosopher (such as Avital Ronnell or John Searle) as a consequence of their philosophy, or as ways to disavowal their philosophy, given that their proclaimed moral principles clearly do not permit or omit such?\n\nI am well aware of the danger of such proposal. First of all, to say that the act/bibliography of the philosopher contradicts their philosophy is to commit a kind of logocentrism (not in the strictest sense of the word) that puts either the form of such contradiction or the biography itself as the locus of truth. Second, to selectively pick out of the biography certain elements (political agenda, ethical/moral problems, etc.) base once again on the principle that they contradict/agree with the written philosophy of the philosopher is even a worse case of said logocentrism. \n\nI know that Derrida has written plenty on autobiography and biography, like the Works of Mourning. But I am not really familiar with his work on these. I also wonder if this is a case of ideology or hypocrisy, in the sense that the philosopher proclaims X, and maybe even genuinely believe in X, but does something different. It would be wonderful if anyone can enlighten me on this.",

        "text": "I'll preface this with a request: please don't provide the \"universe doesn't care, it just IS, scientific rationalist argument etc, I've heard it all before. The subjective experience of reality is in my opinion just as important and to dismiss suffering as neither here nor there feels like a cop out. \n\nOk so I'd ask this in r/areweinhell or r/nihilism except I'd just get confirmation bias. That might seem to contradict the above request but I want discussion as to whether this universe on a subjective level is evil. For example, suffering and agony seem to be hard coded into existence. Animals consume each other in gruesome ways - did you know lions eat the tender meat of their prey while they're still alive? A slow, horrific death. The universe itself is headed towards a cold, oblivion. William Shatner's quote about going up into space got me thinking about this: \n\n\" I continued my self-guided tour and turned my head to face the other direction, to stare into space. I love the mystery of the universe. I love all the questions that have come to us over thousands of years of exploration and hypotheses. Stars exploding years ago, their light traveling to us years later; black holes absorbing energy; satellites showing us entire galaxies in areas thought to be devoid of matter entirely… all of that has thrilled me for years… but when I looked in the opposite direction, into space, there was no mystery, no majestic awe to behold . . . all I saw was death.\n\nI saw a cold, dark, black emptiness. It was unlike any blackness you can see or feel on Earth. It was deep, enveloping, all-encompassing. I turned back toward the light of home. I could see the curvature of Earth, the beige of the desert, the white of the clouds and the blue of the sky. It was life. Nurturing, sustaining, life. Mother Earth. Gaia. And I was leaving her .... It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with overwhelming sadness. \"\n\nThe expanse of the universe is as Shatner describes it, a vicious, all-enveloping void. We have an environment of low entropy, Earth that will itself be devoured by this darkness. Dissolution and pain seem to be constants. Human behaviour on a global scale where the environment is being destroyed and we enslave each other, murder each other over territory, torture each other for amusement...all of these phenomena are manifestations of an existential axiom of pain. We are plonked into existence and instead of enjoying ourselves in a utopian existence, the universe dictates that we compete against each other for survival or die but why? \n\nWe are, as far as I'm aware, the only species to ask why and indirectly imagine alternatives to this universe. In a way our minds are not fully bound by physical reality when we can envisage these alternate realities and question the reality presented to us. If one were to design a universe, why not have change without creation through destruction? We only assume that how the universe operates is the only way things can function since we are mostly constrained in what we can imagine since we're part of it, but we can also indirectly fumble towards alternative systems.",
