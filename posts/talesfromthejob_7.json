        "text": "Once upon a time, I worked in an amusement park we shall refer to as Pixie Dust World. I had a couple of different jobs during my time there, but this story comes from my time as a character handler.\n\nFor those who aren't aware, whenever you go to an amusement park and see one of the characters out taking pictures with people and signing autographs, the character has at least one handler with them. The handlers help take pictures, organize the lines, and ensure that the characters stay on schedule.\n\nOn this particular day, I was chilling with Buddy the Astronaut. Buddy was one of my favorite characters to work with, the line was progressing nicely, and there was lots of shade in the spot where we were, so I was in a very good mood.\n\nBut alas, there's always someone to ruin that.\n\nMost amusement parks nowadays have a FastPass/Quick Queue system that lets you get to the rides faster. But at the time I worked there, there was no such system for character meet and greets. The only way you could get to the front of a character line was if you were a kid from Make a Wish or another similar organization. In that case, the kid would have a special pass, and they'd get the VIP treatment for obvious reasons.\n\nAnyway, whenever a MaW kid came to see a character, the protocol was to check their pass, then go and ask the next person in the main queue if it's ok to let the MaW kid go first. Nine times out of ten, they are perfectly happy with it. But there's always that tenth who makes a fuss.\n\nAnd then there's this asshole.\n\nSo like I said, chilling with Buddy, having a good time. I see a MaW family heading my way. I check their pass, they're good to go. Go over to the queue and explain that I've got a MaW kid and ask if they mind if they go first. Family says yes, great. \n\nAs I turn away, I hear an angry tut from the queue. I glance back to see an angry woman with two kids glaring at the MaW family.  Oh great. This is going to be fun.\n\n\"Lucky,\" she hisses as the MaW kid goes up to Buddy. \"I wish my kids had cancer. Then we could cut every line!\"\n\nThe silence that followed that was unlike anything I've ever heard. Everyone who heard her, from the other guests in the queue to the photographer, was staring at her. I was too floored to say anything, so I turned my back on her and did my best to make sure the MaW family had a good time. Fortunately, I don't think they heard what she said.\n\nLooking back, I wish I would have done something. I'm not sure what, as Pixie Dust World is pretty strict about how we treat guests. But still - don't go wishing your kids had cancer. Your wish just might come true.",

        "text": "...at least that's what the meeting request says.  I get there, there are cookies and coffee and all of my new team, about half of whom I've met.  The boss who hired me comes in and closes the door.  She proceeds to explain how her boss has given her a terrible performance appraisal.  She makes several points about how she has been accused of unreasonable demands, poor communication, using charge accounts as punishment, and insulting her team in public.  There is nothing but silence in the room.  She says she is going to leave the room for 20 minutes and that when she comes back, we should have solutions to this problem.  So she leaves and closes the door behind her.  After about 30 seconds of silence, I say \"Wow, that was uncomfortable.\"  The lead engineer says, \"Welcome to the team.\"\n\nSo there is a relative consensus in the room after about 10 minutes that it has gotten better over the last 6 months.  But that there is still a communication issue.  She keeps priorities to herself, and when they shift, there is no explanation offered.\n\nThe conversation degrades after that, but it seems there is way too much nervous laughter.\n\nShe comes back and almost immediately someone tells her it has gotten better over the last 6 months.  She is happy to hear it.  After some more awkward conversation, the lead tells her, in a very round about way that she needs to delegate more of the priority setting to team members.  She responds with, \"But how am I going to do that?\"  And waits for the answer.  I'm thinking, well duh, you give up some authority, but it sounds like you don't do that.  More awkward conversation, but nothing of substance.\n\n**TLDR;** The parallels to an abusive spousal relationship are uncanny.\n\nAny way for me, I'm stuck in this new team for some time.  I'm over 30 years into my career, so I think I can handle this, but wow, that was a interesting introduction to a new job.",

        "text": "[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c4ncn/the_hours_factory_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/)\n\n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c7d11/fuck_this_shit_part_ii_the_desolation_of_my_will/)\n\n[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c84is/fuck_this_shit_part_iii_the_reckoning/)\n\n[Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2x94fy/fuck_this_shit_part_iv_a_new_hope/)\n\n[Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2xc15y/fuck_this_shit_part_v_the_engineer_strikes_back/)\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSo, at this point - I'm on my way out, and I have no fucks to give. So GeekEng and I decide to pull our picture prank, and don't care if it pisses anyone off. From last time:\n\n&gt;Well, we decided to change that, and ASAP. We hatched a plan to replace every single picture in the office on anyone's desk with a picture of myself and/or GeekEng recreating the picture - Just to see what kind of reaction we'd get. But, we would have to wait until no one was in the office - We didn't want anyone to know about it, and wanted to see how long everyone took to catch on.\n\nSo, we decide to pull it off in the office once everyone leaves, print them right there, and just replace all the pictures in 1 night. We waited til the last person left the office (about 7:30, go figure) and got to work. When it was finished, we had a few pretty damn good pieces of work. QuietGirl's engagement photo? Imagine ex-con looking me being the little spoon, embraced from behind by a portly bearded man, with creepy/loving smiles towards the camera. It only got better from there. Pregnancy announcement cards, wedding photos, children's yuppy glamour shots, nothing was sacred. We finished and headed home around 10pm. Totally worth it. \n\nThe next morning, I show up at 8:30, and the reaction is golden. Most people are absolutely laughing their asses off. They're taking the pictures and showing each other, etc. Well, most people are. The managers? They're quietly sitting at the desks. They had all quietly taken the pictures and thrown them away. Time for work, people..\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSo, they're at their last ditch attempt to get me to submit working 45+ hours per week minimum, and they need a plan. They got it! They'll write me up! This is going to go over great!\n\nSo, Next week in the office, I get a meeting invite. It's me, Dumb-As-A-Post, CBA, and HRGuy. Like this isn't obvious. I am told that because I'm not getting my 50+ hours a week of work done, and because of my attendance problems, they're going to implement a Performance Improvement Plan. PIP, for short. \n\nThings are always more fun when you use an acronym.\n\nSo, now there's more of a paperwork trail to detail my refusal to do my job. You know, because I wasn't told what the job entailed in the interview. That's my story, at least. Their story is that I'm a shitty employee. \n\n*Side Note - PIPs and the like are almost always a method used by companies to create a paper trail for people they want to get rid of - It covers their ass in the way of unemployment, since they don't want to pay it, and their unemployment insurance goes up if they do. Most of the time, If you get put on one of these, and you haven't been getting along with people at your job, update your resume.*\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the meantime, I have met with my future manager, and am just waiting on HR at [EnergyCo] to put the paperwork through on the new job. This would end up taking about 1 1/2 months, because they're lazy as fuck. More on that in the next series.\n\nSo I know I'm getting my new job, and am just playing the waiting game. Every week, I go to our little PIP meeting, where I get told I need to work extra hours, and I sit there silently thinking, *\"The fuck I do, I'm dropping every project I'm on in your hands and walking out the second that I can.\"*\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSo, after 5 or 6 of these weekly meetings where they would say something along the lines of, \"You're not improving.\"\n\nand I would think something along the lines of, \"You'd think you'd be smart enough to realize by now I'm not going to do what you want me to.\", we were at wits end with each other. They needed someone to go on a fast 2 day trip to a cheese plant in New Mexico, and decided that my life was less important than the other engineers, so I was chosen to go, with 1 day's notice. Ironically, I was offered the job at [EnergyCo] the afternoon before I left for NM, and my PIP meeting was scheduled for Friday at 5 pm. Hmmm - that's a bit too obvious, fellas.\n\nNow, I could've just up and quit, and not shown up for the airplane (the company had it's own airplane - Nice for situations like this), but that would've been the obvious move. No, we'll play the long game. I was getting a free 2 day trip to NM out of this.\n\nSo, the next morning I get up, and head over to the airport. I was in a pretty chipper mode, understandably at this point. I started to type out a resignation email, but all I could seem to muster without losing focus was, *\"Fuck you guys, I'm out.\"*\n\nBy the end of the plane ride to NM, I'd gotten it typed out. The airport had wifi, so I sent that bitch off and closed Microsoft Outlook. I'd let em sweat it out for the rest of the day. I then called GeekEng once we got to the plant, and let him in on the knowledge. I called another friend at work, one of the IT guys, and let him know too. He said he'd seen some weird stuff come across his desk as well - He wasn't told why, but they needed him to stay til 6 on Friday. Apparently, they didn't want me even having the possibility of access once I was let go. I told him now that he probably wasn't going to need to worry about staying late. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I set about getting my shit done for the next 2 days. In about 5 hours, I had everything done that I needed to for the 2 days, but of course I normally would have to act busy since I wouldn't be able to leave, and didn't want to look lazy. However, this time was different, because I didn't care what they thought now. So I strolled over to the electricians' work trailer to see what they were up to. \n\nThe foreman was in there, talking about how the project was going to unfold. I started zoning out, and snapped back when I heard, \"and /u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 will be taking this over and running with it.\"\n\nMy response?\n\n*\"Nope.\"*\n\nCue foreman's confused look while he says, \"Yeah, you were assigned this now. It's yours.\"\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Well, that may be the case, but I'm not going to do it.\"* I wanted to drag this out a bit.\n\nForeman - *\"Why can I ask?\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Yeah. I quit today. I'm done in 2 weeks.\"*\n\nWhat followed was a rant by the foreman about how no one in the Engineering sector stuck around to finish projects, that this was the 3rd engineer assigned to this project and how now it was going to take longer to get the design done, etc, etc. - I just smirked. \n\nThe team of electricians on the project - 4 of them - were a bit miffed, to say the least. I walked up to one that I'd worked with before.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Hey, I'll buy you guys a couple rounds tonight to make up for it. My bad dude.\"*\n\nAnd that solved that.So, the day moves on I bum around the plant (side note - cheese plants are clean as fuck), and we leave to head to dinner. I completely forget where we ate - along with pretty much everything else that night. What I do remember is heading to the \"bar\" with the electricians. Apparently, there's some weird law about bars in NM, which makes Applebee's the night place to be - I'm not kidding. Picture the middle bar area empty of chairs, with young'uns grinding on each other to dubstep, while right over the wall is a WASP family of 4 eating their bourbon street steak and chicken fingers. It was surreal.\n\nSo all 5 of us grab a table and start drinking beer. It doesn't take them long to ask why I quit. I tell them what I've told everyone here only the 5 minute version, and they aren't surprised at all. They say that's what every new engineer seems to do at [Company]. I figured as much, but it was interesting information nonetheless. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSo the waitress came around again, and I ordered a shot of Patron for everyone.\n\nElectrician 1 - *\"Dude, you don't need to do that. We don't care that the project is getting reassigned, really.\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"What do you mean? I ain't paying for this shit. It's going on the company card.\"*\n\nIt simultaneously dawned on all 5 electricians what I was doing. The waitress came up with the shots, and I just said, \"Add it to the tab.\"\n\nElectrician 1 ordered another round, and the waitress said, \"Sorry, we aren't allowed to put one drink in front of you until your current one is finished.\"\n\nWe all looked at each other, down the shot, and Electrician 2 said, \"Just keep looping around with more shots. We'll let you know when we're done.\"\n\nThen I woke up with one of the worst hangovers I've had in my entire life. I'm pretty sure the only reason I woke up was because the foreman was pounding on my door, which matched the pounding in my head, jarring my to consciousness. I stumbled over to the door, opened it, muttered \"I'm not making it in. Come get me at lunch.\" closed the door, and puked all over the bathtub.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nBy the time I got back to the office the next day, the story had already made its rounds. It was epic, when compared to anything that had ever happened at that company, from what I hear. All I'd done is quit and then go out that night on the company card. In all fairness, I'm told the bill was over $700. I don;t know, because although I signed it, I don't recall ever seeing a receipt. Oh well. I remember trying to take the waitress home, failing miserably, getting in the truck, and that's about it.\n\nI have a meeting about 4 pm with CBA, and he starts peppering me with questions, about New Mexico, then about my other projects as well. I can see where this is going, so I just play dumb. I don't know the status on anything, I don't know what's been ordered, I don't know what designs have been completed. You want that info? Read my email.\n\nAt the end of the day, I was called into Dumb-As-A-Post's office, for what I assume was going to be a reaming. Instead, it was decided that I would be paid for my full 2 weeks' notice, but they didn't want me coming into the office anymore. I signed some papers, cleaned up my desk, and had 2 weeks' paid vacation on top of my banked vacation pay before I started my new job. I'm told that to cover for me not giving CBA any info on my current projects, he killed it on overtime for 3 weeks straight to get caught back up to where I was. Serves him right.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nGeekEng - He still works there to this day. He's going to get his P.E. license with them (they pay for all of it) and then start looking for a new job.\n\nQuietGirl - Quit about 6 months after I did to go back and work for her parents at their cabinet shop. I told you she wouldn't last long. The pretty funny part was that her friend from school started there before QuietGirl left - after QuietGirl left, her friend left, too - to join the seminary... You know a job is bad if they leave to be a nun.\n\nThe other engineer that was under CBA with me quit about 6 months ago, and now works at [EnergyCo]. [Company] is hemorrhaging engineers like nobody's business.\n\nHRGuy has moved to a different division, but is still there. I did my exit interview with him, and was told later that Dumb-As-A-Post was in complete denial mode about it - the hours aren't what are driving people away, it's the town - If they could just find people that wanted to move there, it'd be fine.\n\nCBA - still works there. Still an asshole. I heard rumors of him being demoted, but I'm not 100% clear on that yet.\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - still reading self hell books, and trying to shoehorn them into others' lives as well. I've heard the other divisions want him gone, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.\n\n**Sorry this didn't flow as well as the rest, I'm in a hurry to tell you guys the next story about how I got fucked over and fucked up my job at [EnergyCo] now. It's like I just don't learn that good... I'll get started on that one soon.**",

        "text": "Holy Shit Guys, I'm sorry it took me soooooooooooooo long to write the next installment of my first series, but let me tell you - Have I got a doosie for you in the next series - I've been busy burning bridges there for the last year and a half.\n\nIf you've never heard of my series or me, I don't blame you. If you'd like to read it (and you probably want to, so everything here makes sense), see below:\n\n[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c4ncn/the_hours_factory_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/)\n\n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c7d11/fuck_this_shit_part_ii_the_desolation_of_my_will/)\n\n[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c84is/fuck_this_shit_part_iii_the_reckoning/)\n\n[Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2x94fy/fuck_this_shit_part_iv_a_new_hope/)\n\n[Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2xc15y/fuck_this_shit_part_v_the_engineer_strikes_back/)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy non-passive-aggressive attitude wasn't getting me anywhere. Of course, this didn't matter to me, because I didn't want to work there anyways - I didn't see myself there for more than another few months while I searched out a new/better job.\n\nSo, time to update the resume. My first stop was GeekEng, to see if he knew of any job openings in the area. He didn't, but the drafter in his group did - it was a position at a company he used to work at. He gave me his old manager's number, and I gave him a call and set up a time for lunch. With a bit of my stress lifted for the day, I went over and shot the shit with GeekEng for a bit. We talked a bit about how the atmosphere was dead in the office, as always - no joking, no fun. \n\n[Scarily accurate depicition of Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjJCdCXFslY) \n\nWell, we decided to change that, and ASAP. We hatched a plan to replace *every single* picture in the office on anyone's desk with a picture of myself and/or GeekEng recreating the picture - Just to see what kind of reaction we'd get. But, we would have to wait until no one was in the office - We didn't want anyone to know about it, and wanted to see how long everyone took to catch on. *Edit - This will be described in the next writing.*\n\nIn the meantime, Dumb-As-A-Post and CBA (Competent But Asshole) decided that I needed to be \"educated\" on what being an engineer meant. They seemed to think if I was just shown that people who work 60 hours a week get more out of work, I'd want to do that too. That was wrong, but it didn't stop them from trying.\n\nTheir first attempt was to have a meeting for all the engineers that discussed \"Time Management Strategies\". I was really tempted to decline the meeting and say \"I don't have the time to attend this.\", but as they had put HRGuy in the middle of this and had him conduct the \"meeting\", I didn't want to put him on the spot. So, like a good little employee, I went to the meeting. Of course, there was another self help book that was required reading beforehand, but I skipped that. Once in the meeting, you could tell that it was geared towards me and thinly veiled to be a meeting for \"everyone\". HRGuy had a piece of paper he kept reading from, and the questions seemed to come straight from Dumb-As-A-Post.\n\nHRGuy - *\"So what strategies do you use to organize your work?\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - .......\n\nand on. The one great response I had that didn't just play the game went as such:\n\nHRGuy - *\"So what do you do when you find that you can't finish the work you have in a given week?\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"I go home.\"*\n\nBoth QuietGirl and HRGuy fidget uncomfortably in their seats. GeekEng smirks.\n\nHRGuy - *\"But what do you do to finish the work that was scheduled for that previous week?\"*\n\nThe funny part was that you could see him going down a script for this - It's like they expected me to answer this way. \n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"I push it forward to the next week. If I can't get it finished in the 40 hours that I'm working and it isn't absolutely needed on Monday, I'm going to leave it for the next week.\"*\n\nGeekEng is in a full on grin now - He caught the 40 hour remark, and wanted to see this out as much as I did. I was silently pleading with HRGuy to push the 45 hour work week, so I could unload. Alas, he was smarter than that, and dropped it with a, \n\nHRGuy - *\"Well that is an option, but it does hurt your 'Percent Complete\" metric which affects your year end bonus.\"*\n\nThat's fine, I don't plan on being here that long.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttempt 1 to get me to \"fall in line\" obviously had no effect, and even emboldened me somewhat - I wasn't putting up with their shit.\n\nTheir next strategy? Publicly put everyone except me on the \"management track\" - Basically make an example out of me to the rest of the company. *You want to stand up for yourself? Well look what happened to /u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - you really want that to happen to you??*\n\nThey actually made a point of sending out company wide emails discussing the management training, and mentioning all the engineers that were doing it, while making sure I wasn't included. \"QuietGirl, GeekEng, etc, etc will be meeting this week to discuss such and such, /u/LostMyPassswordAgain2 will be working on such and such project\" type shit.\n\nI laughed about it to myself and let it slide - really don't care, guys. This pissed them off to no end. Who wouldn't want to advance in the company, and spend more time here? You get more money!!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey were at a loss of what to do. It was about this time that a cool new project came up for bid. It was for a potato processing factory in Idaho (go figure) that basically was going to make hash browns, french fries, etc. HUGE plant. Problem is, everyone dropped the ball - Deadline was approaching, and they didn't have anyone working on the bid - They didn't even have a motor list set up yet, and the controls division was having a conniption. They had to come and ask me to work overtime to finish it by Friday. It was Tuesday. \n\nI took the prints home with me that night, and went to fucking town. Cranked Foo Fighters, Metallica and more while I hammered out the motor list. Ended up with over 800 motors, with all info organized into an easy to read chart. at 4:30am, I emailed the list to the entire management team.\n\n*&lt;All -*\n\n*Here is the completed motor list for [Project]. I know it wasn't due until Friday but I wanted Controls to have time to get their bids done as accurate as possible. Let me know if you have any questions.&gt;*\n\nControls loved me. CBA and Dumb-As-A-Post hated me now. Why? Remember, they loved to play Pass-The-Buck. When they assigned the project to me, they didn't want it to get done in time - That way it was my fault, and the blame was shifted from them. Now, I had made it public that I had worked an all nighter to save their asses. Come 9:30 am when I strolled into the office with 4 Rockstars in my arm for the day ahead, I didn't even get so much as a, \"Thanks, /u/LostMyPasswordAgain2, we really appreciate it.\"\n\nWhich I knew was going to happen. However, the controls division made their disdain for my managers and company clear to me in the Reply All emails - *&lt;Thanks SOO much, we didn't think we were going to get this in time to put the bid in! I owe ya!&gt;* and the such. I smirked, and went back to work. I couldn't wait to get out of here.\n\nWhat did catch me off guard was the email I received around noon from my manager, CBA.\n\n*&lt;/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 -*\n\n*It has come to my attention that you were not on time this morning (approx. 20 minutes late). We have our core hours from 9am-4pm that you are required to be at work, so that meetings can be scheduled easier and people can contact you if need be. Please work harder on being at work on time in the future.&gt;*\n\nSo now we're playing the \"rules are rules\" game - Even though I just saved their asses by working all night, I still wasn't \"on time\" to work so they were creating a paper trail showing me not performing \"to standards\".\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nLater that week, I got a phone call from GeekEng's Drafter's old manager, and we talked about the open position at the company that will herein be referred to as [EnergyCo]. I was told to throw my application into the online site and he'd push it through, and get me in for the interview. \n\nI was getting out of here, and it couldn't come sooner.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I'll finish this up in the next part, promise.*",

Today I will regale you in another tale from a time I worked for a startup IT Company which will have you wondering many questions as you shake your head in disbelief.  This may not be as funny as other tales, but there are no embellishments or liberties taken to make this humorous.  This is how things panned out.\n\nI assure you the following is not a tale of fiction.  Some conversations have been truncated to clean up the flow of the story moving along.\n\nLet us set the wayback machine: Mid-2012 \n\n**\"Doesn't the fight for survival also justify swindle and theft? In self-defense, anything goes.\" - Imelda Marcos**\n_______________________________________________________\n\n&gt; \"Hey, wanna hear what happened at the bar last night?\"\n\nI sighed as I closed the lid of my laptop and looked over at \"RockTech\".  The owner had hired RockTech from one of our smaller competitors as a residential bench tech a month prior and from day one I questioned the validity of that decision.\n\n\nRockTech was a young 20-something PFY.  A real PFY.  He had large holes cut into his earlobes and ringlets put in them to expand the size of his lobes.  Piercings dotted his lip, ears and nose.  Perpetual scruff struggled to form a beard.  He enjoyed metal and hard rock, claimed to play guitar and enjoyed dressing like a grunge rocker. \n\n\nI normally don't judge people on their looks but if my Boss wanted people to take our shop seriously and gain the trust of the local businesses this wasn't the look the upper-mid-west/northern plains folks warmed to.  \n\n\nI gave him the benefit of the doubt when he started.  We required all techs to have their A+ certificate by the time they hit 6-months of employment. That was a requirement that I was firm about when the owner asked me to be part of the business and gave me free reign in setting rules, requirements and procedures for the techs.  \n\nRockTech had *some* knowledge in PC repair but it was obvious in the first few weeks that he lacked basic understanding and some basic skills.  He also had no interest in getting his A+.\n\n\nHis customer service was akin to a pissed off badger so we kept him in the back, well away from the customers.  He also had a tendency to talk about tech topics as if his view (which was often wrong or a very narrow POV) was the only one that made any sense. This led to some interesting moments between us as O had nearly the same amount of years of experience in IT as he was old.\n\nIt didn't help matters any when I proved, every time, he was mistaken.  He didn't like being proven wrong, even when I tried to do it in a way that was nice...but after a couple weeks, I just stopped trying to be nice around the guy.  I hate, hate, HATE using the \"I'm your manager, just do what the f$&amp;% I tell you to do and stop arguing\" line on anyone...but he just was so stubborn I had to do this over and over.  I still tried to teach him but he never wanted to listen.  \n\n&gt; RockTech: (*Repeating himself*) \"Hey, do you wanna to hear what happened at the DrunkDove last night?\" \n\nOh yes, I almost forgot....the bar he loved to go to was called “The Drunk Dove” which was a particular dive bar located downtown.  \n\nOk...in reality, calling it a dive bar is insulting dive bars.\n\nThis was a rat's nest posing as a dive bar.  John Taffer from \"Bar Rescue\" would probably compare it as a sister bar of that \"Rock-N-Roaches\" bar \"Headhunters\" in Austin, Texas.  I half-joked that someone should just drop a match in this bar after hours and walk away...the end result would be more sanitary and more appealing.  Rude staff, sticky floors all over, no toilet paper, overly loud music, and the drinks are horrible.  Only buy bottled beer.   I’ll refer to it as TheDrunkDove.\n\n&gt; Me: (*mentally sighing*) \"Sure, RockTech. Tell me what happened at TheDrunkDove last night.\"\n\n&gt; RockTech: \"Ok, this is awesome.\"\n\n&gt; Me: (*under my breath*) \"I'm sure it is\"\n\n&gt; RockTech: \"Huh?\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"What?  Oh, nothing...just talking to myself\"\n\n&gt; RockTech: \"Ok.  Well last night I was at TheDrunkDove fooling around with my phone and checking out the wifi networks that my phone could pick up.  TheDrunkDove had this public wifi network up for guests to use. I log in with their free wifi password.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Wow. That’s…..an interesting story.\"\n\n&gt; RockTech: (*Looks at me oddly*) \"Anyway, I get on and check the IP address on my phone.  It is a 192 network.  So I try logging into the gateway and see it shows me they are using a Netgear.  I found the default login info online and tried it and got into the router!\"\n\n\nNow at this point, I'm concerned. RockTech is one of our techs now and having one of our techs going around in his off hours and hacking into networks of businesses isn't something we happening.  \n\nSure, it was a hack any middle-schooler or grade school kid could do but it still was hacking and not cool.\n\n&gt; Me: “Ok…”\n\n&gt; RockTech: “So, I’m in the router and I see that their credit card machine is hooked up to the network…”\n\n&gt; Me: (*Oh…no…you didn’t* I think to myself)\n\n&gt; RockTech: “…so I set the WAN IP from DHCP to static and put in some random numbers.”\n\nMy mouth is probably hanging open at this point from the gall of this guy.  Sure, TheDrunkDove is one of the worst dive bars in the area, no doubt, but still it isn’t cool to do that to the wait staff.\n\n&gt;RockTech: “So as I am sitting there, the servers and managers are starting to freak out a bit because the credit card machine, the POS system and the internet is down.  ‘Missy’ one of the bartenders sees me at the bar in my LITTLE-IT shirt and tells 'Rick' the manager.  He comes over to me at the bar and says ‘Hey, RockTech, you are good with computers right? We’re having issues with the internet’.  So he takes me into the back where the office computer and cable modem are at and asks if I can fix it.  I told him I can fix it if he would cover my tab for the rest of the night. He agreed so I start to mess around in the router settings to make it look like I am working on it and when he leaves for the front, I change the WAN IP from Static to DHCP and a minute later the internet is back up.”\n\n\nRockTech is smiling so large you would have mistaken him for a lotto winner.  I just wanted to punch him.  \n\n\n&gt; Me: “So you hacked a business’ network, killed their internet, defrauded them out of alcohol and you were wearing a shirt with the company logo on it?  Are you stoned or just stupid?”\n\n\n&gt; RockTech: “Relax, it was harmless. Their internet was down for like 30 minutes. No one suspected I caused it”\n\n\n&gt; Me: “That isn’t the point”\n\n\n&gt; RockTech: “Like you haven’t done something like that before”\n\n\n&gt; Me: “No, I never have hacked a business’ network. We are talking about you and how you broke that network and told the manager you would fix basically what you broke in the first place but he had to compensate you. Sure he didn’t know you were the reason it was broke but you did.  Legally, that’s bad.   Finally, you are in one of our shirts when you do all this.  Don’t you see a conflict of interest in being in a LITTLE-IT shirt but being compensated personally?”\n\n\nRockTech and I go round and round over this.  He thinks it is just harmless.  I’m seeing all kinds of legal and ethical issues, not to mention PR issues for the company that I had helped start up.   \n\n\nBut… in the end, I let it go. I didn’t forget about it but RockTech was on notice that I wasn’t happy and crap like that wasn’t to be tolerated. \n\n______________________________\n\n**\"To use for our exclusive benefit what is not ours is theft.\" - Jose Marti**\n____________________________\n\n\nMonth after TheDrunkDove incident, RockTech and I again butted heads.  \n\nNormally, I am not in-shop.  I was an onsite guy but today I had brought the laptop of one of our largest clients into the shop.  ‘Doctor Mike’ owned a couple businesses in town, one of them being a large eye care business which was where he and I met.  \n\nToday, ‘Doctor Mike’ asked me to tune up his daughter’s laptop before she left for college in a month, throw in more RAM and put in an extended battery.  I told him I’d have it ready to go out by 5pm Friday (three days away) because I had to order in the RAM and battery, but I would start the tune up right away.\n\nWhile I didn’t do residential repairs anymore and wasn’t in shop much, I still had a dedicated area on the work bench that was mine just in case I had something I needed to work on for a business client.  I see that RockTech is working on a customer machine.  I set the laptop down at my area and unlocked my tool chest, pulling out the USB drives I needed, and started cleaning up the laptop.\n\nI had noticed there was a computer on the ‘in’ shelf that had no paperwork and looked as if it was just pulled off the floor of a restaurant’s kitchen.  So disgusting, but whatever.  Sometimes the owner brought a computer in to be worked on for a special client or these might have been donations we needed to part out.  \n\n_______\n\nLater that night, around 8pm, I had just left a local restaurant just around the corner from the tech shop.  Awesome mexican food and I have to say they have the best fajitas in town.  I had to pass the tech shop to get home and as I got closer, I saw the tech room lights were on.\n\n\nNow this isn’t a big deal.  There were many nights where I or the owner or the owner’s brother-in-law ‘Kal-el’ would unlock the shop after hours and work on a PC that had to go out, or we would stay late to get something done.   Only I, Kal, Owner and Accountant had keys for the shop. \n\n\nThinking it was the boss, for the fact that I had nothing to do and I enjoyed my job so much, I decided to duck in and offer any help I could.  \n\n\nTurns out it wasn’t Kal, the Owner, or the Accountant…and it sure as hell wasn’t me in the shop.  It was RockTech working on that crappy black-cased PC. \n\n\nI made an excuse that I left a USB drive in the shop that I had put files on that I needed and rumbled through my tools until I came up with a USB drive that I really didn’t need.\n\n\n&gt; Me: “Hey, what are you doing in so late?”\n\n\n&gt; RockTech: “Working on a buddy’s computer after hours.”\n\n\nThe owner and I were cool with this.  If your best friend or immediate family wanted you to do some repair work for them, we were fine with you working on it after hours at the shop.  Parts would be Cost+10% (to mainly cover shipping) but labor, of course, was free.\n\n\nI did notice, however, that the computer had a sticker on the side with the logo and name of “TheDrunkDove” on it.\n\n\n&gt; Me: “Someone must really like the TheDrunkDove”\n\n\n&gt;RockTech: “Well, yeah.  Its TheDrunkDove’s office PC.  He is paying me $100 and a $100 bar tab to fix up this PC for him.”\n\n\nI talked to RockTech some more about the PC as I pretended to check the cleanup status of Doctor Mike’s laptop, bid him good night and left.\n\n\nThe minute I walked out the door I called the owner and related what I just learned as well as the conversation RockTech and I had about his adventures in WiFi.  The phone went silent for a moment. \n\n\n&gt; Boss: “You mind waiting there?  I’ll be at the shop in 10 minutes”\n\n\nAbout eight minutes later the boss pulls up to the shop and we both walk in together.  RockTech is still working on the PC for TheDrunkDove. The owner of the shop made a little small talk with RockTech as I hung back.\n\n&gt; Boss: “Whose’s PC is that on the bench?\n\n&gt; RockTech: “The manager of TheDrunkDove asked me to fix up their computer.”\n\n&gt; Boss: “We are billing him for this, right.”\n\n&gt; RockTech: “Well, I was doing the work as a favor to him.”\n\nI could see the anger boiling just below the surface for Boss. \n\n&gt; Boss: “Is he giving you anything for compensation?”\n\n&gt; RockTech: “Yeah, $100 and a bar tab.”\n\n\n**LOW. ORBIT. ION. CANNON**\n\n&gt; Boss: “So you are using my shop after hours to repair computers for other businesses and are charging them and keeping all the money.  You are using my business to run your own business.”\n\nRockTech sputtered, his face looking like a spanked monkey’s rear end.\n\n&gt; Boss: “And how are you getting into my shop after hours?  You don’t have a key so how are you locking up when you leave?”\n\n&gt; RockTech: “Well, I’m using the spare key from the lock box.”\n\nThe Boss talked to RockTech about his wifi exploits as well and after some back and forth, he told RockTech to give him the spare key (which he did) and get the hell out of the shop. He was fired and take that computer with him.\n\n**TL;DR: A tech learns working at a shop is not the same as owning a shop**",

It's not messy, but it's not super clean.\n\nCurrently, I'm also working on helping bring us into the 21st century.

That's the thing. **No one does.** This guy, even, uses the \"spread out paper across my desk into piles\" method to sort things.

        "text": "I used to work at a below average golf course, when I was right out of college. My boss was great, and the co-workers who were close to my age were all great. Haven't worked there in over a year and I still keep in touch with just about all of them. \n\nBut, there was one guy. We'll call him Bill.\n\nBill was of the age to be retired, but was still working. He thought he was the world's savviest investor. He was a manager at a restaurant. Then at another restaurant. Except Bill was extremely rural and had a thick drawl, so he was a man-gur at resternts. He lost tons of money trying to get in on every pyramid scheme he could find. If there was a scam, he put his money into it. He once told me about sending money to people on the internet in order to get more money. He wasn't exactly brilliant.\n\nAnyway, the course was open every day of the year except for Christmas and Thanksgiving. I worked every Sunday, and Bill worked one Sunday a month with me. This tale is the first conversation I ever had with Bill.\n\nI'm a little over 6ft tall, and Bill had a solid 6 inches on me, and easily 100lbs all in his gut. Just about every Sunday at The Course was pretty busy, unless it was really bad weather. \n\nThis Sunday was rainy, so there was no one playing. It was late spring, so it actually felt really nice to sit under the awning outside the pro shop and wait for something to do. We were sitting in those black iron deck chairs that people get when they're trying to be vaguely modern or hip. We hadn't really said much other than just passing small talk. No real conversations. Until now.\n\n\"Jermy (his pronunciation of Jeremy, which isn't my actual real name. Not even close) who'd you vote for that last presidential election\" he asked.\n\nI was a little surprised by such a straight forward question from someone I really didn't know, much less who couldn't get my name right. \"I didn't vote that time. I was living somewhere that I hadn't changed my registration for.\" \n\n\"Well, good. I was fraid you voted for that Obama.\" \n\n\"No, I'm not really into politics much anyway,\" was my response and attempt to kill the topic quickly.\n\n\"You should learn some bout it, cause Obama is gonna kill the whole thing any time. Everybody wants a know if he's a Muzzlem, if he's bern in America, if he's a socialist. There's just too many damn questions fer me to trust him.\"\n\n\"I've seen a lot of that stuff, but I don't really put much stock into that. I mean, I don't even think his religion matters for the job anyway.\" That was my response. I know, looking back this was probably the worst way I could have responded. I know that now.\n\n\"WHAT? You think it's okay for Muzzlems to be in America, let alone be the president? You kids sure don't know much about the stuff people fought wars to protect. I just don't know what to say now.... I'm surprised Jermy. I figgurd since you went to college you'd know better, but those places just push their liberal agender on kids. Just promise me you'll look into politics more. Promise me, Jermy.\" \n\nI nervously chuckled and just said \"Okay, I'll look into all of that stuff for the next election.\"\n\nHe mumbled about how that was good and kind of trailed off. I kept praying that was the end of it. Turns out it wasn't. About 5 minutes later, he started up again, breaking the steady rain pattering on the tin roof with his gruff voice.\n\n\"Jermy, I think I gave you the wrong impression of me. And since we're going to be workin together, I don't want you to think that about me. I like you, and I think yer a good kid.\"\n\n\"Bill, no need to worry. I think you're a fine guy and I think we work well together.\"\n\n\"Good. Good. I'm glad.\"\n\nI was actually starting to look beyond his previous political rant, because he's not the only one who thinks that way. \n\n\"Jermy, aint nobody born prejudiced or racist. They just aint. (Seriously, after what he had said about 'muzzlems' I almost fainted at that statement.) Ain't nobody born to think that way, it's a learnt behavior. But, well, Jermy. Well, I just don't like ni***rs. Don't like em one bit. They ruin America, they ruin the world. Why don't they go back to Africa? That way they can all get AIDS and die and then the world would be better off.\"\n\n\"Ummmmmm, I don't know\" was all I could get out, with a beyond surprised look on my face. \n\n\"When I was in high school down in Tennessee, I had this good friend who was a cullert boy. Marshall was his name. And boy, we did everything together. I tell you, we was the best of friends. But one day, all these other cullerts started playin basketball with us at the school. And Jermy, you know what? He was their friend. And he started runnin with this gang of ni$$$rs and doin all sorts of crime with them. And that was when I learnt that all ni***rs is no good. That was over 40 years ago, and I bet he's either dead from gang violence, AIDS, some sex disease, or he's just rottin away in prison. 40 years ago I learnt that ni$$$rs ain't worth nuttin, and look at the world now, Jermy. We done elected a ni$$$r president who ain't even from this country who just wants all us whites to be dead so he can do whatever he wants. He's done sent America down the drain, the world is laughin at us and he's just trying to find ways to bring in Muzzlem law instead of the constitution. He's trying to shit on our country just so he can be a black muzzlem. Jermy, tell me now, promise me that you'll get involved in takin America back. I ain't gonna be able to live much longer, cause they got them death squads that's gonna start coming and killin people who've lived too long. And you better bet that they'll start shootin the people who don't like what that ol coon in the White House is doin to our country. This country needs people like you, young people like you, to figure out how to stop this just plain awful ni$$$r president and get America fixed. Can you do that for me, Jermy?\"\n\n\"................ Um.............. I guess if it's really a big deal to you, I'll start looking into who I vote for more than I do. You don't have to worry about me, Bill.\"\n\n\"Good. I'm gonna go back in the kitchen and fix me a burger, you want one?\"\n\n\"No, my shift is almost done and I'm not really hungry.\"\n\nBill got up, went into the kitchen, started cooking a burger, and I quietly clocked out and went home. \n\nAnd that, was my first Sunday will Bill. The old, pyramid scheming, beer bellied, conspiracy theorist, hardcore racist. ",

        "text": "I work at a kids' birthday party place where kids play and then eat pizza, cake, etc. Last weekend I had to work a 1 year old's birthday party. They're not my favorite because you can't talk to them or do anything with them. But it went alright. The kids all seemed happy and the birthday child's mom was satisfied with the service, enough that she tipped me an average amount.\n\nOr so I thought. When I came into work earlier this week, I was told that she called the store, had a list of complaints, and demanded a refund.\n\nFirst off, she said that the pizza was cold and slightly burnt, and since I allowed the kids to eat it I wasn't qualified to do my job. The pizza was definitely not cold when the kids ate it and it didn't look burnt at all. Since we're not allowed to eat any of it, how would I know that? And I lol'd when I heard that she said I wasn't qualified to do my job. The pizza place that provides our pizza does a shitty job with the pizzas we order half the time and no one ever complains.\n\nSecondly, she claimed I was inattentive to the children while we were in the room eating our pizza and cake. In what was even a bigger lie, she said she TOLD me I was inattentive. She did no such thing. And I was paying a lot of attention to my party. What else am I supposed to do when I'm working alone? I tried to cater to the kids as much as I could. But there were only 8 or so kids, and they all ate and drank extremely slowly. I tried to do a lot but for most of the time, I sat back and watched and waited for something to do.\n\nLastly, at the end of the party she gave me a tip, like most customers do. It was slightly below average, but I didn't think anything of it. In her long complaint, she mentioned she wanted a refund and that she wanted to take her tip back. You'd think that she wouldn't have tipped me in the first place if she was unhappy, so that part made no sense at all. We couldn't refund the tip, obviously, but we decided to refund her what she paid for her pizzas. Even though I knew they weren't cold and burnt (how is that possible, anyway?).\n\nMy managers were cool about it. I'm considered a good employee at my job since I consistently get some of the best reviews of anybody in the store. They dismissed this lady as crazy when I told them that nearly everything she said about me was an exaggeration or a lie. \n\nTL;DR: Worked a birthday party for a 1 year old, her mom seemed happy at first but later told the managers how terrible I was which was based on mostly lies.",

        "text": "Hey guys ! [Obligatory introduction about being a long time lurker, first time poster]\n\n\nI work at a distance education center. We provide education at home for people who can't/don't want to attend classes. We send you books, you do the assignments, and, if everything goes well, you graduate !\n\n\nSo I just remembered this story; it happened a little over a year ago, I had been working at my office for only 6 months. It's common that we get a lot of special snowflakes, but we have some that we especially watch out for, because of how bad they get and how much of our time they waste (some to whom we are not even allowed to talk to anymore, but that's another story.)\n\n\nOn the very last day before I went on a 2-weeks holiday, 10 minutes before closing time, this man calls and I'd heard about him through my coworkers, but never actually spoke to him. We know it's him because he always answers with ''Yes, hi, I'm a student from your school.'' in a very monotone voice. So when I answer, I immediately know it's him; we'll call him Monotone Man (MM) :\n\n\n&gt; Me : [Distance education center], how may I help you?\n\n&gt; MM : Yes, hi, I'm a student from your school. I'm currently studying [random book] and it says I need Microsoft Excel to do it, but you didn't send it to me with the book.\n\n\nNow, it's common for people to believe we provide Microsoft Office with the courses, as you need Word, Excel, Access and Outlook, but unfortunately, we don't, and it says so in our information booklet. However, all students must complete the books in the order they appear in our information booklet and, according to where he was at, he should have needed Word and Access earlier in his course, so I'm slightly confused as to why he would not have Excel.\n\n\n&gt; Me : I'm sorry sir, we don't actually provide Excel with the courses, you must buy it from a store such as [names a couple stores] or you can buy it online.\n\n&gt; MM : My tutor told me she provided it for other students, so I demand you send it to me !\n\n&gt; Me : Well, sir, if your tutor said she would provide it for you, then you could ask her to send it to you. Here, at [distance education center], we don't provide it for students.\n\n&gt; MM : No, she said you had to send it to me !\n\n\nAnd this goes back and forth for a couple minutes with him constantly trying to get the last word like ''Okay, so you're sending it now, bye !'' and trying to hang up on me (as if that would even work?) and me almost yelling ''WAIT, WAIT !'' everytime, until he eventually spouts out this gem :\n\n\n&gt; MM : Do you even know how expensive this program is?!\n\n&gt; Me : Yes, sir, I know it's expensive as I bought it for myself. Unfortunately, we have no way of-\n\n&gt; MM : Then you can send it to me !\n\n&gt; Me : ... I'm sorry?\n\n&gt; MM : You have the program at home ! Send it to me !\n\n&gt; Me : Sir, I bought this program with my own money, it is not owned by [distance education center], it is my personal belonging. Now-\n\n&gt; MM : I'm not going to steal it ! JUST SEND IT TO ME !\n\n\nAt that point, I should have been gone on a 2-weeks holiday for 20 minutes and was not getting paid to deal with his crap, so I simply hung up. I should have informed him I was going to do so, something along the lines of ''Sir, I do not like the way you are speaking to me, and will now end this conversation'' (as we are allowed to do), but I was so enraged all I could do was hang up and start crying.\n\n\nHe called back about 12 seconds later and demanded he be transferred back to me, to which my coworker replied it was not happening, and he told her to let me know I was a ''bad sprout''. \n\n\nNeedless to say, he had to make a nice trip to the electronics store to buy his program *with his own money*.\n\nEdit : Formatting (Or at least trying to)",

        "text": "I work at a car dealership and service center as a detailer, which basically amounts to keeping all the dealership vehicles relatively clean inside and out, and washing and sometimes cleaning up the interior of vehicles that have been in for service.  Not my dream job, but I get to play with a pressure washer and listen to audiobooks all day and usually don’t have to deal with customer stupidity. Usually.  Some days though… \n\nI’ve been at this job for over 3 years now, and have quite a few stories to share.  This one happened today though, and it’s what prompted me to start writing them down. \n\n\nWe’re a pretty small business.  In the shop, there are 3 mechanics (Alpha, Bravo, and Lungcancer), a tire and lube guy (Captain), his temporary assistant (Temp), and yours truly.  The rest of the service department is a parts guy, his assistant, and two supervisor-type guys.  Then there’s the sales department, about whom I could rant for days.\n\n\nNow, customers aren’t supposed to come back into the shop area unless escorted by an employee, for obvious safety reasons.  But there are quite a few that we make exceptions for.  One of them is an older guy who spends hours at the dealership, going around and talking to everyone.  He’s a bit barmy, but he occasionally brings donuts or does a favor for the shop, so everyone tends to humor him.  He’s been known to pull up to the dealership, turn off his truck, and “accidentally take a nap in his truck in the parking lot” for an hour or so before coming in to socialize. We’ll call him Greg, short for gregarious. \n\n\nAnyway, today, Greg was in talking to Alpha Mechanic like usual and I was washing a recently purchased used pickup truck that was in to get some accessories put on.  As I was drying the truck, Greg asked me a few questions about the truck.  It still had the dealership plates on, so he probably assumed it was still the dealerships.  \n\n\nI finished up and parked it in the bay where Captain and Temp would be putting on ventshades and some chrome stick-on crap and moved on to my next project: a super muddy ranch truck.  Fun.  I was just getting started on the mud monster when Captain asked me for some denatured alcohol to prep the surfaces for the stick-on crap.  I grab it and bring it over to him, and as I do I see Greg on the passenger side of the truck, digging around in the door pockets. \n\n\nHe brings out a little canister and sprays a bit of it, probably to see what it is.  Hurrying over to see what he was up to, I get a better look at what was in his hands.  Pepper spray. By the time I get over to him, his hands are orange with the spray.  He sniffs them, not even God knows why, and goes into a coughing fit.  Alpha turns around and sees what Greg has done, and sends him off to wash his hands.  \n\n\nI look into the formerly clean cab.  Pepper spray juice all over the floor mat.  Easy enough to clean up, I just hose them down and let them dry. More on the windshield, dash, console, cup holders, door, and passenger side window.  Every time I think I have it all cleaned up, I spot another batch of spatters, but eventually I get it back to rights.  Greg comes back, hands clean but still wheezing a bit.  He just flat out threw away the pepper spray canister, since it was coated in its own juices.   \n\n\nMy interrogation of him goes something like this:\n\n&gt;Me: Greg, what were you doing getting into a customer’s stuff anyway?\n\n&gt;Greg: Oh, this is a customer’s vehicle?\n\nI look at the obvious signs that this is a personal vehicle: sunglasses, gum, and other crap in the center console, doodad hanging from the mirror, keyring with a bunch keys in the ignition, box of tissues on the seat, multi-tool (and formerly, pepper spray) in the door pocket, etc.\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah, Greg, it’s a sold vehicle.\n\n&gt;Greg:  Bah.\n\n&gt;Me: Why’d you spray that crap?\n\n&gt;Greg: Well I didn’t know what it was.\n\n&gt;Me: You made a mess.  \n\n&gt;Greg: You shoulda just left it.\n\nWTF?\n\nAlpha asks Greg if he washed his hands thoroughly, which Greg uses as an opportunity to flee from The Inquisition.  I put the freshly washed floor mat back and start blasting away at the mud monster.\n\n\n(advance apologies for any formatting errors, etc., this is my first text submission)",

What we do not do, however, is set up appointments.\n\nAbout an hour ago, I had a patient come in with an insurance referral to have a drainage pump removed; okay, cool this is easy. So I go to find their account and...there isn't one. Strange. Okay, so I search their name....no record of their name. So I question the patient for about ten minutes about what all is going on, the steps they've completed, and who they've spoken to. All I get from the patient is:\n\n**Patient**: \"I had a pump placed in me here and I had to change my primary doctor, so they told me to come here to get it removed because ya'll were the ones who put it in.\"\n\n**Me**: Okay, who was the doctor?\n\n**Patient**: Well, I had to change it from MD1 to MD2 because I had to get this referral for my insurance.\n\n**Me**: And they set up an appointment for you to come here?\n\n**Patient**: They told me to come here to get it removed.\n\n**Me**: But did they actually set up an appointment for it? I can't find you or an account in our system.\n\n**Patient**: I'm not sure\n\n(sigh)\n\nSo I call five different departments, all of whom have no idea what I'm talking about; talk to my boss twice, who says to call the primary MD's office; call said MD's office since that MD is not in our hospital records, the office which also closed early b/c it's Friday, and just when I'm about to call the medical exchange to page the MD personally....\n\n**Patient**: All I need ya'll to do is set up an appointment so I can get this pump removed today. Can ya'll set up an appointment or not?\n\n(insert sounds of screeching brakes)\n\n**Me**: ....We don't schedule appointments, only MD offices can do that and they send the forms to our scheduling dept. who sets up accounts and put you in our system.\n\n**Patient**: So ya'll can't schedule me today?\n\n**Me**: No, only your primary care physician can do that, so you'll have to call them, but since their office is closed, you'll have to go to the ER if you need it removed today.\n\n**Patient**: Oh...I probably should have asked you that from the start, shouldn't I?\n\nIn my mind, I was thinking, \"Yeah, you probably should have, before I spent half an hour fretting over why you're not in the system.\"",

Locally, the area is known for not being a great place...and working at this park on busy days, it's not hard to see why the park district has their own internal police force.\n\nFor the six years I worked here, I had a number of run ins with less-than-pleasant individuals. Nothing serious, but a lot of citations for public drunkenness, drugs, customer-on-customer feuds that rarely escalated into physical fights...that sort of misbehavior. Working the admission gate, you saw it all and sometimes you could just tell when things were going to get rowdy.\n\nThere were a lot of working-poor in the area, and a large population of immigrants (many of whom were likely illegal)...but, let me tell you, they were often the least of your problems...in fact, I dare say that many suspected illegals were downright friendly, pleasant, church going types.\n\nHere, the two worst customers I ever had in my whole time working there were **two crotchety old ladies in their 60s or 70s.**\n\nAs a ranger, one of my duties was inspecting boats before they got into the water. Many parks are concerned about invasive mussels: quagga mussels, zebra mussels, etc. that can do a lot of local economic damage with their infestations. They wreck boats, pipes, and pretty much everything else they attach to.\n\nSo, these ladies were cordial at first...until I start talking about inspecting their boat. Making it clear they didn't give two sh*ts about \"barnacles\", they let me know that they had been on a long trip and just \"wanted to get in the f***ing water\". After a few minutes telling them that I was required by law to inspect the boat, they refused to submit to an inspection and demanded to talk to another ranger. Ultimately, my supervisor told them the same thing, and she even assured them that we could \"waive the inspection fee\" (8 dollars) to appease them.\n\nUnhappy and irrationally angry, the two ladies decided to simply pay for parking for general park use. I thought that would be the last I heard from them, but sadly it wasn't.\n\nSomehow, the two older ladies roped one of the newer laborers into getting their two-person rowboat down to the water near one of the fishing docks. The newer employee didn't know regulation about boat ramp usage and **the two \"sweet old ladies\" assured them that I said their boat had passed inspection.**\n\nSo, their boat (which would have passed inspection if they had simply yielded to it) got into the water, but after trying to board from the dock and almost falling into the water the new employee wisely decided to involve more personnel.\n\nSo, a game warden pulled them out of the water and with my statement, evicted them from the premise. They were not cited (I suspect because they were old ladies) but at this point I was just happy they were gone.\n\nDays later, I got a message from one of the higher-ups about a complaint that the ladies filed with the parks...but when me and the game warden told him about the two old bats, all he did was laugh.\n\n",

This is a tale of a delivery.\n\nIt was a warm day this past summer. I had just loaded 32 toner cartridges into my SUV to deliver to the local Sheriffs department and courthouse. As I'm driving down the road to get there I drive past one of the deputies. I merge into the lane in front of him and the red and blues light up.\n\nAt this point I'm running through what I might have done. Speed: granny pace. Swerving: not hungover so no. Signals: crap. At this point I figure that he is just pulling me over to harass me. I roll down the window and the conversation got crazy in a hurry.\n\nOfficer: \"Do you know why I pulled you over?\"\nMe: \"I can't think of any reason sir.\"\nOfficer: \"When you pulled back into the right lane you didn't signal\"\n\nI knew it. Either had a quota or was bored. About this time he looks in the rear window and sees that the entire back of my blazer is filled with toner boxes.\n\nOfficer: \"Where are you headed to?\"\nMe just blurting the first thing that comes to mind: \"The home of your people!\"\nOfficer: \"Excuse me!?!?\"\nMe: Yeah the home of your people, the Sheriff's office.\"\n\nAt this point I hand him the sales order from my office and a copy of the purchase order from the county.\n\nOfficer laughing hysterically: \"Just go! Forget about it. Just go!\"\n\nI proceed to the courthouse to make my delivery. Thinking to myself that I just avoided a giant pain in the rear I realized that my license plates had been expired for a good three months. I forgot all about it and the deputy didn't even notice. Good thing he never finished getting the tags checked!\n\nEdit: Proofreading... Not my thing.",

While I have many MANY tales about DD's dealership, this tale comes long after I had broken free of his grasp. \n\nI worked for DD for about 18 months, sold 100 vehicles within 6 months and got promoted to Social media manager for the remainder of my time there (12 months of being paid to take pictures and chat. It's NOT all it's cracked up to be, believe me!). \n\nI left on my own good terms and occasionally visited my ex coworkers from time to time. Then I started a new part time business, where I could save business owners significant savings. I approached DD's in house controller with this prospect and was given a statement to check (normal day's work, check what is being paid out, suggest improvements, carry on with sale). After initially processing the statement, it was discovered that DD would save $175 a month. A fairly decent sum of any business owner's profits. As required, after presenting my quote, I asked for their business. I was told that DD needs to look at the figures and decide but the controller was going on vacation first so I could return in a few weeks. Few weeks later, I return. Now DD is busy, so I was rescheduled again (it happens, owners get busy, make another appointment. Rinse repeat). Finally after a number of emails (3 months later) I get the all clear to come in to get the paperwork completed. This is where things hit the wall. \n\nI handed the paperwork to controller, who proceeded to complete the required info. While she was completing things, she asked questions and carried on. The entire process took about 30 minutes. She took the papers to DD to sign and they got faxed away to my boss. Controller had made a mistake by stamping the documents so the documents had to be resubmitted (argh). This time, DD wasn't happy. Something he had initially agreed to, he no longer thought he should. \n\n\"I bought a $500,000 photocopier without signing a guarantor. Why do I need this?!\"\n\nI felt like asking if I could buy a car without signing but I held composure and left. After speaking with my boss, he got on the phone to an even higher boss and called me back. \n\n\"We have approval for DD without him signing. We will call him for you!\"\n\nGREAT news right?! Yeah not so much...\n\nDD basically told my boss to \"go f**k yourself\" after wasting all our time involved. Even though I didn't get the sale, I smile while driving past now, knowing that I COULD help him, but every competitor that I sign around him, will gain instead. \n\n\"Go f**k yourself too DD\" :)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2ml8pd/upperdecker_in_the_call_center_toilet_not_for_the/",
        "text": "Hello folks. Allow me to tell the tale of a Call Center I worked in years ago. This was in Delaware, just off a major highway, situated on what Delaware colorfully refers to as a \"Superfund Site\", meaning it's built over an old landfill. They covered multiple accounts, but the cast of this story all worked for a popular clothing company who produced annoying, overpriced and questionable quality clothes, with a penchant for body shaming and putting nudity in their catalogs. This is relevant, because this incident took place shortly after said company first put nudity in their catalog, so stress from dealing with angry middle-American moms was high, and the company refused to offer any sort of apology or explanation. Being the first line of defense for the company at the time, we felt left out in the cold.\n\nSo one evening, my friend, well call him Joe, decides to lighten the mood, and his bowels, in what we referred to as \"the back bathroom\". Joe had recently been promoted to Lead, and he was \"in charge\" on this evening. This bathroom was adjacent to the rear entrance of the building, and was basically known as reserved for those who needed a good dump, and for the college kids who worked in our account to go and have sex (I wish I was kidding) during the night shifts. Anyway, Joe tells us he's off to the back bathroom, which is his way of saying that the floor will not have only have one Lead for the next 10-20 minutes. Time passes, and Joe returns. We notice a sly grin on his face, as he walks towards us. \"Us\" being his group of friends who worked there. We all knew each other outside of work. He sits down at an empty cube, and proceeds to tell us that he took an \"upper-decker\" in the back bathroom. Maybe it's because we were young, and innocent to the horrors of this world, but none of us knew what he was talking about. Having known Joe the longest, I piped up with \"what's an upper-decker?\". Joe proceeds to explain \"That's when you remove the lid from the tank on the toilet, and take a dump in it. So the next time someone uses it, it refills the bowl with poop-water\". Being the kids we were, this was utterly hilarious to us (OK, it's still kinda funny now). So we imagine the reaction from the next person to use the back bathroom, and have a good laugh.\n\nFast forward to the next evening, when we all show up for our shift. We stagger in, ad are met with a gathering of employees, and the Manager, whom we never see on the later shifts. Having put the previous night's events out of our minds, we wondered what was going on. I honestly thought for a minute that they were closing, as that was the general mood.\n\nThe Manager calls attention, and begins detailing what was going on. Now this has been almost 20 years ago, so I'll paraphrase if you'll permit me, good reader. He says \"There was apparently an incident last night in the early AM hours, where one of the overnight reps went to use the back bathroom, and the toilet massively overflowed, flooding the rear of the building and breaking the toilet. We know this was done intentionally, and not by the last person to use it. We had to contact three different 24 hour plumbers, because the first two would not touch it, just to get the water stopped. We then had to call in a disaster cleanup crew this morning to get all the water pumped out and the carpets cleaned and dried. We will also need to get much of the drywall removed and replaced in the rear of the building. Until this work is complete, the back bathroom is off limits. Now we know this was done by someone on second shift, so we're offering special considerations for anyone who comes forward with any information. IF we find out who did this, they will be terminated on the spot.\"\n\nThose of us who knew, exchanged quick glances containing a mixture of horror and absolute hilarity. Joe stood there, steady as a rock, with a very serious look on his face, like he wanted to catch who did this just as bad as management.\n\nThe meeting broke, and we all went to our stations. Joe followed us in, sat down next to us, and could hardly contain his laughter. He was literally crying and trying to stifle his laughter. Those of us who knew, made a pact to never tell management, and we never did. After this incident, management really clamped down on the amount of merriment that was permitted in our room, and we all had to make sure a Lead knew where we were at all times. They never suspected it was a Lead that did this, much less Joe. Joe moved on about 6 months later, not too long after I left.\n\nA while later, I bumped into one of the managers at a bar, after we had both moved on. She laid it all down. She said the plumber told them that someone intentionally pooped in the tank, and that it usually clears out after a few flushes. But apparently, this was a rather sizable and dense poop, so it totally clogged the water passages in the toilet, causing it to literally explode the cover off the tank and spewing water and crap all over anyone unfortunate enough to be in the bathroom, and thereby breaking the toilet. He has said he's seen it before at college frat houses and the like, but never this bad, and never in this setting.\n\nTo this day, Joe and I are still good friends, and I never let him live this down. Yes, it was an absolutely horrible thing to have done, and I'm certainly not making light of what that poor person who was in that bathroom must have went through. We were all young and stupid. Joe perhaps the dumbest of all. :)\n",

This particular post will tell you about the an employee that got on my nerves this week.\n\nWhen I started this week's new hire class on Monday I had four trainees - D, J, S, and M. They all seemed reasonable people and M in particular seemed quite sharp. He also happened to be the boyfriend of a current employee and came highly recommended. Normally we give them the new hire paperwork during the interview to fill out and bring back with them when they begin training. With this particular class, however, our hiring manager had gotten a little behind and none of them had been given paperwork. No big deal. I give them the packets and ask to have them back the next day.\n\nTuesday comes around and M is a no show. At first I figured he was just late because we got hit with a snowstorm and driving is tricky. After 15 minutes I call him, got no answer, leave a voicemail, and start class. Two hours later when we take out first break he still hasn't showed or called. His girlfriend happens to be off today too so I can't ask her what the deal is. I call and leave another voicemail and long story short he never shows up. That sucks, I guess he didn't need the job that badly.\n\nNow it's Wednesday and all morning long our center manager has been getting on my ass about M going AWOL. We have to pay him for the day that he was here but don't have any of the paperwork. Apparently it's my fault for letting him take the paperwork home, never mind the fact that we have always let them take the paperwork home and the other three trainees didn't have a problem showing up.\n\nHow was I supposed to know he'd never come back?",

Usually read TFTS, but this doesn't exactly fit in there, so... tada!\n\nWay back when I was in high school, I worked over the summer for the family business, a local ice cream company. Not only did we produce ice cream, we rented freezers for clients to sell it out of.\n\nOne of our customers was a factory, and sold ice cream out of a refrigerated vending machine in their break area. To stock the vending machine, they had a chest freezer with a solid lid. (As opposed to the freezers you see in convenience stores with the glass lids you can see the product through. The chest style are more efficient, as they are insulated on all sides and have a rubber gasket around the lid that controls airflow.) \n\nEventually, that factory decided to go with another supplier, but didn't actually tell us this. They just unplugged our freezer. Still full of ice cream. FULL of ice cream. In July.\n\nAt least two **weeks** later (I don't remember the exact timespan), they decided maybe they should give us a call to come pick up our unit. The head of service and I know what's coming, but we drive up to the client, load the freezer into our truck, and head back to our shop.\n\nWe get back, and finally open the thing up. All of the ice cream had of course melted and gone sour. There were 5 inches of rotten milk/chocolate/nuts/fruit bits/packaging floating the in bottom of the unit. The sides of the unit were completely (And I mean *completely*) covered by hatched maggot shells.\n\nIt was, hands down, the worst thing I have ever smelled. I couldn't get within 10 feet of the thing without nearly retching.\n\nOf course, being the high school kid, I got to be the one to clean it out. (The service guy certainly didn't want to do it.) I wore a painter's respirator so I could get close, kicked it over so the mess would flow into the parking lot drain, and used a kerosene-heated power washer to clean it out.\n\nIt still took a good 3 hours just to make it visibly clean, and longer to get the smell out.\n\nI hope to never smell anything that bad again.\n\n(And now a small twofer; same thing happened to my grandfather decades before. The store was up in the mountains, and went out of business. For this one, it was a month before we found out. So my grandfather goes up there with a coworker, pulls the freezer unit out of the shut-down service station into the parking lot, and kicks the unit over on its side. He then looks at his coworker and says \"Alright, let's go.\" Two weeks later, he came back and picked up the cabinet, after the racoons etc had had time to clean the worst of the mess up for him.)",

        "text": "As an administrative assistant, I don't take very many days off because too much crap goes down whenever I'm gone, so naturally, when I took a sick day yesterday, the spaghetti hit the fan and I returned to an excellent story I'd like to share with you all.\n\nFirst, some background. I work for a field office for a small sub-contracting corporation in Indiana, far from the prying eyes of corporate on the other side of the country. We have a love-hate relationship (more hate than anything) with the corporate HR lady, Midge*. She usually makes life more complicated than is absolutely necessary, but sometimes, when the moon is full and we're in on the joke, she's not so bad. This is one of those times.\n\nUpon returning to work today, my boss, Bill, informs me that I missed some serious stuff yesterday and begins to fill me in. As a sub-contracting company, many of our clients require our personnel to complete safety training on-site before beginning a job. Sometimes, they also require a drug test. Whenever this happens, we usually try to give them a heads up just so they aren't caught completely unaware (which would make us look bad as a company). Usually, this doesn't pose any problems since most of our guys are on the road so much, they would be hard-pressed to smoke weed every night as it is.\n\nWe have one employee, Jose, that lives out of state. He returns to the office after a job and informs Bill that he has to return home because his wife is in the hospital and she may have cancer, BUT he'll be back in two days. Bill senses something is up because it's really odd that he would fly back for just two days and the timing is really odd. I mean, this guy just found out he has to take a drug test, and now this bizarre thing with his wife? Yeah, no.\n\nSo, Bill fills his boss, Timmy, and Midge in on what's going on since we will now have to fly an employee from another location to our office to go on this job. They all agree that Jose's story is fishy and Midge gives Bill the go-ahead to request documentation from Jose showing when his wife was admitted to and discharged from the hospital and a date for when he will be moving to Indiana like he promised back when he first got hired on a year ago. When Jose doesn't respond for the next 24 hours, Midge schedules an appointment for him to get drug tested in Florida, but when Bill tells him he needs to be at THIS address at THIS time for a drug test, Jose says, \"I'm with family at the hospital and family comes first, bro. I'll go tomorrow.\"\n\nAt this point, Bill, who hates nothing more than being lied to, is getting irate, and Midge takes matters into her own hands. She calls Jose's house \"looking for Jose\" and his wife, Mrs. Hernandez, picks up. Midge plays innocent and says she's looking for Jose. His wife is confused and informs Midge that Jose is in Indiana working. Then, Midge asks her if everything is okay and whether she's been in the hospital recently. Mrs. Hernandez tells Midge that she was in the hospital for an outpatient surgery a week and a half ago, but nothing serious.\n\nSomeone really ought to let Jose know that it's bad karma to lie about a loved one having cancer...\n\n*All names have been changed to protect the identity of all those involved",

        "text": "I work at the circulation/reserve desk at a college library and boy do I have a bunch of tiny little stories about working with college students... \n\nOnce, this guy was watching gay porn on one of the computers near our desk. One of the students went to complain about it but the guy was gone before it was too late.\n\nAnother time I had a student get pissed at me because we only had one copy of a chemistry lab manual and was upset that there was only one copy.\n\nI've had students demand me to go get their book on reserve without getting the call number... worse is when they say the book is right THERE and they point at it but policy does not let me do that, especially when they get pissy about it. \n\nI've had another coworker who does help desk that's on the same floor tell me how this girl wanted him to help her pay her bills online... not happenin'\n\nThe other day some guy got all pissy at my boss because he owed $5 for bringing a reserve book an hour late... months ago... and there are signs everywhere detailing the costs of things. This brings me to all the people who say \"I didn't know I was going to be charged!!\" &gt;_&gt;\n\nThe first floor is the nosiest place in the entire building. We also have a little section right when you enter where you can talk and eat food, known as the lounge. One woman twice had come up to me and even spoke to my boss ranting how there's no signs saying you can talk and eat here, she was complaining how noisy it is in the lounge... even though she had the rest of the building that has \"quiet zone\" signs all over to study at.\n\nOnce this guy needed help with the copy machines, he wanted to make like a 100 copies of something and wanted to use the feeder. I told him he shouldn't do that as it will most likely cause a paper jam and to go the manual way. He ignores my advice and gets a paper jam and loses his money. Comes up starts complaining, thankfully other coworker goes to handle it...\n\nOnce this guy who was an alumni from another school wanted to borrow a reserve book from us... however he isn't even supposed to be in the building as only current students, faculty, library friends or alumni of this college can enter... so he should not be allowed to use stuff at all. He keeps bitching at me, I get my supervisor who talks to him... she eventually okays it, as long as I get ID from him. But he bitches and throws his ID at me as he gets me his book and asks if I want his credit card too... &gt;_&gt;\n\nWe have a line students have to get into if they want to borrow a book. One of my coworkers was all can you get in the line and then suddenly this student just loses her shit and starts spazzing on my coworker. He gets the book for her but she's still mad and still won't get on the line. He asks for her ID in which she screams more saying I never have to use my ID to get my book (I checked her circ history and she has taken the book out a few times before... so why she's acting stupid to this day I will never know). Another coworker steps in and she screams at him too.... Eventually she got the book and returned it but I never saw her come back after that.... \n\nOne guy took some books out but they weren't desensitized correctly which happens sometimes. Public safety tells him to come back to the desk so we can desensitize them again but the guy loses his shit, yells at public safety and storms off to class. 10 minutes later, the guy is dragged back to the library with some other public safety people to our desk. I desensitize the books for him, and one of the public safety officers asks him, \"that wasn't so hard, was it?\" Mind you, it's a pretty big campus so the fact they found them astonishes me to this day lol.\n\nThis past summer a girl wanted to overnight two reserve textbooks. The policy is you have to come when it's closing in order to overnight it and there needs to be an extra copy, not 3 hours before. She was giving an attitude and wondering why she can't just do it now. One of the books we only had one copy of and she was upset it she couldn't take it home with her. Eventually she came back, overnighted the one we had 2 copies of but she never brought it back until a week later... and she wanted to take the book we only had one copy of home.... \n\nSpeaking over overnighting, I had a student literally overnight a book the entire semester lol, which is quite an accomplishment since we closed at 9:45, and you'd have to bring back the book 9:15 in the morning. \n\nOnce this girl screamed that we gave her the wrong book after she made like 20 pages of copies... wow. \n\nThis past winter a staff member got all pissy and yelled at us because she wanted to take a book out, but on her account it said she owed a book from another college. She claimed that she returned the book and doesn't understand why we can't give her the book. My boss and I told her to just call the other school and if it's on the shelf her account will be cleared. She gives a fit asking to take the book out and eventually leaves, 20 minutes later comes back account is clear and issue is resolved. Ah. \n\nOnce I had some guy who owed fines try to make me waive his shit. He's all \"oh it must be your first job that's why you're taking it so seriously, you can bend the rules\". Yes I bend rules for good/nice patrons sometimes, but say shit like that and your chances of me ever doing a favor for you goes down to 0%.\n\nWe had this really weird student once who used to talk to my coworkers but then suddenly just went silently and didn't talk to anyone. Let's call him Bruce. Bruce took two reserve textbooks out, and wanted to renew one. However, one of the books he wanted to renew literally 2 students kept asking for it. When he came back my coworker told him he can't renew it, to give the other students 15 minutes to come and take it out. This offends him as he gives an explanation of how he studies two textbooks at a time, and this is method of studying, and this is wrong. So he literally stood waiting there for 15 minutes to take the book back out. Wow. \n\nI had a reference librarian make me come to his section to help teach an older student how to do citations... yeah no, you get paid 5-10x more than me to specifically help students with that. Needlessly to say I did try. \n\nWe have ipads for 3 day loans, policy is that you can't renew the same one, have to take a new one out (which is kinda eh but oh well). Anyways kid comes who knows the policy and gets offended when I told him he needs to get a new one and that my some of my other coworkers let him renew the same one. I lecture him and gets offended that I talked down to him like a child. Oh well.\n\nAnyone who tries to pay a $2 fine with a $20 lol, our cash register is hella broke, we always scrambling to make enough change/singles for it. \n\nOh and anytime I tell someone they need a call number to take a reserve textbook out and they're all oh here and it's the ISBN a part of me dies.... other than that pretty chill job, coworkers make it worth while. \n",

        "text": "I'm putting part 1 because, though this is the most recent incident, it is neither the first nor last. \n\nObligatory background information: I work in a boutique law firm in Florida. We do a lot of stuff with real estate, specifically collection of debts and foreclosures. \n\nOur receptionist is bad. By bad I mean bad apple bad, felony bad, looks-like-a-toad bad, rude-to-million-dollar-clients bad, rude-to-everyone bad. The only reason she hasn't been fired yet (we *think*) is because none of the clients have complained to our head partner and office manager (she's a whole series of stories by herself), and because we don't do background checks at Perfect Little World law firm (hence having two felony convictions for theft and falsifying information to a pawn dealer). But I digress, we are not all perfect here at Perfect Little World law firm.\n\nOh, but she is.\n\nNow, because I'm a really lowly ranked member of the firm, and when our receptionist's back up is out, (and because our office refuses to accept that some calls will and *can* be missed) I am tasked with covering the receptionist for lunch, for when she needs her ten minute breaks to pee and groom herself in the mirror every hour, and when we need to retrieve and send out our office's mail.\n\nShe had already pissed me off earlier in the day by taking nearly an hour for her little quick lunch in our kitchen not ten feet away from the reception desk, then spending another few minutes in the hall in plain sight having a conversation while I sit being tortured by ringing phones she should be answering, pawning off work onto me, and requesting I take things back that she didn't want on her desk. Whatever, lady.\n\nI had planned to leave at about 4, but with her back-up gone, I was going to need to stay until 4:30 to take the mail down to the mailboxes, and then I would leave. So come exactly 4:31, I am clocked out, standing in the reception area, about to tell her that the reason my arms are full of mail is because I'm taking it down and leaving (because she would actually question me \"Are you taking the mail down?\" looking just like that), and she isn't there. I wait a little while longer, hoping I hear her coming down the hall with her lumbering steps on her 6 inch wedges. Nothing. No sign of her at all. I'm only slightly pissed off at this moment, so I take her little note pad that she uses to write down people's information, and I write in big, capital letters \"I TOOK MAIL - DANIcandii\" and I circled it and left it on her desk in full view of anyone who walked by. I thought, no one could be blind enough to miss this blatant message here.\n\nOf course, I'm always terribly wrong when it comes to this woman.\n\nI'm in the car driving home, and I receive a [text](http://i.imgur.com/psB3z7I.png?1) from this lovely European woman I work with, telling me that our receptionist has gone around the entire office, bothering people with phone calls, looking for me to see if I had taken the mail down and/or left.\n\nNow, logic would dictate that, it's well after 4:30 (our set mail time), DANIcandii is usually on time, DANIcandii is not here, the mail bin is empty. DANIcandii = took mail and left.\n\nBut this is assuming that our receptionist has an ounce of logic about her, which is a dangerous assumption.\n\nNo, her logic was to play phone tag with everyone in the office first, then check the mail bin, with no concept of time, tact, or professionalism. Then she sends me an email, which I received this morning:\n\n&gt;Next time you are leaving at 4:30 and [back-up] is not here, please check with me before you leave and take the mail down. There was more mail to be taken down and you were gone without checking with me.  \n\n&gt;Thanks!\n&gt;[Dumbass]\n\nYes, a perfectly logical response, and I would have done so, had she been anywhere near where she was supposed to be in the first place. I waited and wasted my time on her not showing up to explain, left her a note which did what it needed to *HAD SHE READ IT*. I don't need to \"check\" with her. She isn't my mommy and she certainly isn't my boss. She's the *receptionist*.\n\nAnd the \"more mail to be taken down\" was one letter from a paralegal who had legs and all the capabilities one needs to take the elevator down to the mail boxes and back up again. And that was after our 4:30 mail deadline that *everyone* in the office is aware of. Oh, but that one letter, that could destroy our whole company for going out a full five minutes later than everything else. Yes, I see your logic, madam (this is sarcasm, something which she also does not understand).\n\nTL; DR: our receptionist is a petty butt hole.",

        "text": "\n\nSo I made an introduction post of sorts here http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2f4zy5/organically_yours/ and thought I'd continue the saga here with some stories surrounding a coworker who was mostly a nightmare to work with. She had days where she was tolerable, but we don't want to hear those stories. Lets call her Tina to protect the innocent. Sorry to those named Tina who actually are innocent.\n\nTo get some background on this woman; Tina is a 27 year old single virgin who has never dated, living in her parents basement, not paying rent, chain smokes both cigarettes and pot, is jealous when her friends get boyfriends or start having children, or even mentions sex in passing, worked 4 days a week, is the only employee who wasn't a supervisor making $12 an hour and still managed to be chronically broke. Or so she said. She could be lying on the pay. She's possess many negative stereotypical Taurus traits; moody, stubborn and hot headed. She's also a stereotypical 'Ginger', fiery temper and very, very fickle. She was also very VERY loud. Even her 'indoor' voice was very VERY loud. If you ask her, life handed her a bad deck of cards and no matter how much or many she draws, she's dealt a bad hand every time. Her mood fluctuates, her friends fall in and out of her favor all the time. She ALWAYS brought her drama to work. \n\nThe thing about the place I used to work at is that it's very small. You worked with the same 6-8 people everyday when packing your veggies on the line. There was no picking up your pail and shovel and playing on the other side of the sandbox until that one child throwing a tantrum calmed down. No, you had to stand there and watch as this grown woman gave you a piece of her mind every day for at least 3 hours, sometimes longer, about how she'd be living another's persons life. A lot of the time it'd be a close friend of hers, sometimes a family member. This was the woman who basically got a free pass with shit like this. Take it to the office and it was YOU who was doing the bullying. Sometimes when it got particularly bad, they'd take her aside, slap her wrist and she'd play nice for a week before something else crawled up her ass. \n\nAn example of this is her best friend Evie. When her friend Evie started dating a man 8 years older than her, Tina spent the better part of three weeks at work talking about it non stop at work. \"Evie is such a slut. She can't keep her legs closed for more than a week. That's the ONLY reason this guy is around. Why would an old man want to date someone so young!\" When the two had started dating, Evie was 26. The guy was early 30's. It took them 3 months of dating before Tina finally accepted he wasn't going to be leaving anytime soon and Tina and Evie became tight. When Evie became Pregnant after a year of dating him, Tina started up again. \"The dumb bitch can't keep her legs closed and now if the boy wants to leave, he can't! She TRAPPED him. What kind of person gets pregnant a year into a relationship unless they're trapping them!\" What brought Tina around was Evie's child possibly being born with downs syndrome. Tina was immediately a supportive friend after two months of bashing her friends reproductive choices and wound up dropping a few pay checks on making sure her friend was set up. When the baby was born healthy and Evie's boyfriend proposed to her, Tina started back up. \"I wouldn't marry someone I only been with for two years! It has to be four! You don't know someone until you've known them for four years!\" and \"She hasn't returned my calls for a week now! I called last week after she had the baby and she had the audacity to pitch a fit because I woke her up before 9 am! I don't know about you guys, but I'm a morning person and that's the only time I get to make my phone calls!\" \n\nThis may have gotten a little too personal into someones' life, but everyday, Tina came in, red in the face and the littlest thing would set her off about Evie. This continued well until I quit the job. Last I heard, she was happily playing 'Auntie Tina'.\n",

        "text": "Sorry for the long post! I just discovered this place and am pretty eager to start sharing stories! :D\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I got my first (and favorite) job as a cave tour guide. The area I lived in was well renown for its karst, and although most caves that were available for walking tours were owned by the government, the tour facility was owned privately.\n\nThe facility I worked at offered two different tours for two different caves: a 30 minute tour of a wet cave with lots of cool formations and an easy walking path, great for children and the elderly; and a 90 minute tour of a dry cave with a pretty rugged path, steep stairs, and sometimes very tight passageways. We usually recommended that families with small children use discretion when it came to tours of the big cave, since there were no bathrooms down there and it could get kinda scary.\n\nNevertheless, one day we got a family of three -- a mother, her 4 year old daughter, and her young infant -- who wanted to take a tour of the big cave. The daughter did not look thrilled about the concept of a cave, and I suggested the smaller cave might be better for \"beginners\", but the mother was pretty insistant that it was big cave or moot. She purchased tickets and they joined another couple outside who were waiting for the same tour. \n\nThe cave tour began. 5 people in total. 10 minutes into the tour, the 4 year old freaked out. The poor thing was crying alligator tears and begged her mother to go back outside. To be honest, it's a pretty easy cave to freak out in, especially with so few people in such a big, dark place. I offered to take the family back to the entrance of the cave and give them a refund for their ticket prices, but the mother decided to stick with the tour. \n\n60 minutes into the tour, we got into our big cave's main attraction -- a giant room the size of a football field with a mountain of breakdown and a few formations in the middle. At this point in the tour, guides usually demonstrated how dark the cave truly is by turning off all the lights, telling a ghost story, then leaving the guests on a set of bleachers while we go climb up the mountain and do a fun shadow dance using a candle. I decided to skip the ghost story and shadow dance because of the still scared-and-silently-crying little girl... but I HAD to turn out the lights. The way the lighting system was set up, I could only turn off the lights from the base of the mountain (we were required to turn off the lights as we went, company policy to save on electricity and common courtesy for other tour guides), but could only turn ON the next string of lights from the top of the mountain. \n\nI told the group my plan to leave them in the dark, the lights went off and I began to make my way up the path to the mountain with my flashlight. The whole process took about five minutes, since I would have to break away from the walking path and actually climb up the breakdown to the lightswitch. I was about halfway up when the mother hollered up at me.\n\n* Her: It's too dark in here! My infant is scared! Turn the lights on NOW!\n* Me: I'm sorry, I'm almost there!\n* Her: My infant is terrified!!! Turn the lights ON or show us your FLASHLIGHT!!! \n\nNote that her infant hadn't made a peep the whole trip, and I couldn't divert my flashlight from where I was shining it... or else I wouldn't have been able to see where I was going. \n\n* Me: Don't worry, ma'am, I'm almost to the switch!\n* Her: TURN THE F***ING LIGHTS ON, NOW!!!\n\nAt this point, two things happened. First, I dropped my flashlight and it rolled down the mountain and got stuck in between a few rocks. Great. Then the infant, probably scared by its mother's yelling, began crying louder than anything I'd ever heard. Even better. I had to feel my way back down to retrieve my flashlight, and it took me even longer to get up to the lightswitch. The infant could not be consoled. I then realized that we weren't going to make it out of the cave in 90 minutes, which meant I'd be getting no breaks in between tours. \n\nEventually I got all the lights back on and got the group into the next section of the cave. The mother kept giving me the most evil stare and the other couple on the trip was rather unamused. 80 minutes into the tour, and the mother stopped the group so she could change her infant's diaper. She was upset that she had to change it on the dirty cave floor. Then she wanted to leave the dirty diaper in the cave, and told me I could just \"get it later\". I told her that tour groups were not allowed to leave any trash inside the cave and that she would have to carry it out with her. She refused.\n\n* Her: YOU carry it out! It's your fault there are no trash cans in here! And besides, I'm carrying my baby. How can I carry my baby AND the diaper?!\n\nI ended up finishing the rest of the tour while carrying that dirty diaper out of the cave with me. The infant never stopped crying, and at the end of the tour she complained to my manager that I scared her children. We ended up refunding the tickets of the other couple since I was sure their experience was not enjoyable, but luckily they were very understanding and equally perplexed as to why that mother took her kids on that tour in the first place.\n\ntl;dr - Mother stupidly took young kid and infant on a long, rugged cave tour. They got scared and poopy.\n\n*Edit: words are hard\n",

        "text": "Prior to working retail, I worked 5 years on and off at an organic veggie packing facility. It's some of the most mundane, repetitive work I've had the pleasure of doing. I have many stories from that place, but could never find the place to post them. Former job wasn't quite a kitchen, rare contact with customers so it filled a bit of some roles, but nothing where I could see any of my stories fitting. So lets give this place a go. \n\nI found working there to be grossly unfair. They'd treat certain employees extremely well to keep them around, giving them lighter work loads and more days off while putting more pressure on the other employees to work faster, work more days and longer hours just to keep up with the product demand. If you took complaints to the office about a coworkers bad behavior or work ethic you were accused of bullying them, even if said person said racist things about coworkers while they were working beside them. You had to work overtime with no overtime pay because of farm status for the garden in the back that they sometimes used for profit strictly in the summer months so it wasn't uncommon to work from 7 in the morning to 5 at night. The management sat in the office most of the time and were barely hands on with the new recruits, or anybody for that matter. They put on smiling faces when they had too, but behind closed doors, there was a lot of bickering between the 6 or 7 management team members as they struggled for their say. They often talked about employees to other employees or left the office door open during breaks so employees sitting in the break room could clearly hear everything being said. There was no room to grow, promotions were given randomly to the inexperienced, raises were scarce and you'd be lucky to see much higher than minimum wage ($10.25) after 3 years of service. In fact, if you're hired strictly to pack, you cap out at $10.75. They'd often give certain employees raises to keep them quiet or to keep them around longer, claims from one woman were she was making $12.00 but spent much of her time bitching about everything and did bare minimum work. Mind you this is in CanadaLand, so there's that to consider when talking about minimum wage. When I first started working there back in late 2005 during my first three year run (I left for a year and half about and then went back), about 5 or 6 of the employees were sleeping with each other, there was a chlamydia scare shortly after, they had various points had hired people who actively drank booze on the job, showed up to work high on a cocktail of drugs ranging from pot to coke, ecstasy to mushrooms and any mixture of any of them (once had a coworker show up high on horse tranq's but said it was okay because she mixed it with coke), Rarely did they fire anybody because they were hurting for the workers. During the year and a half I was gone, they cleaned up their act after their food safety was questioned and wound up laying a bunch of people off before hiring me again. I spent the next three years coasting at this job until I couldn't take anymore. So r/talesfromthejob, where should I begin?",

        "text": "My company started almost 20 years ago, and I was the first employee hired (after the founders).  We started in a small office with just a few of us and soon grew to 250 people, taking over the building space on all sides of us.  In that first location, I was centrally located -- all the senior people tended to be in the middle since that's how the company grew.  When window offices opened up, I didn't want one since it would move me away from the center of the action.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, our company moved to another building.  As is typical, the windows seats were assigned to those with seniority, so I had a window assigned.  I sat there for a day and hated it because of where the sun was in relation (glare, heat, brightness), so I moved away from the window.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, we were moving again.  Of course, seniority would get the windows again, and I knew that my department was on a non-sun side, so I thought I'd want it.\n\nEnter the antagonist, Mari.  Mari had also been with the company a long time, so had about a year or two less seniority than me.  She currently had a window office, and key to the story, she currently had a window office and has had a window office for much of her time at the company.\n\nAlso key to the story is that I knew she was getting a window office in the new building because I saw the \"secret\" (not secret, but not disseminated yet) list.\n\nMari comes to me in an indignant mood.\n\n&gt;Mari:  We need to trade offices in the new building.  So, I'll go tell Rob, OK?\n\n&gt;Me:  Why do you want to trade offices?\n\n&gt;Mari:  Oh, you're just sitting where I want to be.  You'll like it better if we switch.\n\n&gt;Me:  (Starting to suspect what was going on.)  Oh?  What's better about your future office?\n\n&gt;Mari:  Oh, it will just be closer to the conference rooms and kitchen.  You'll like it better.  I'll go tell Rob, OK?\n\n&gt;Me:  (Playing dumb.)  Well, if you think I'll like it better...  But what I really want is a window office.\n\n&gt;Mari:  Oh, no you don't.  You'll like this other office better.\n\n&gt;Me:  Do you know if I'll be getting a window office in the new building?  I don't have one now and that makes me sad.\n\n&gt;Mari:  Oh, no, you don't want a window office.  They get hot sometimes.  You'll like this new office better.\n\n&gt;Me:  So, are you saying that I've been assigned a window office in the new building?\n\n&gt;Mari:  Well, yes, but you won't like it.  I'm sure you won't like it.\n\n&gt;Me:  Oh, I've always wanted a window office.  That makes me so happy that I'll _finally_ be getting one.\n\n&gt;Mari:  No, you don't want it.  I have a window office now and I'm sure you don't want it.\n\n&gt;Me:  So, you want to do me a favor by switching offices with me?\n\n&gt;Mari:  Well, yeah, I guess so.\n\n&gt;Me:  (She still hasn't recognized that I'm messing with her.)  That is so nice of you!  Will I owe you anything in return for the favor you're doing for me?\n\n&gt;Mari:  Well, no.  We'll just switch offices.  I'll go tell Rob, OK?\n\n&gt;Me:  No.  I've changed my mind.  I want to try out one of these sucky window offices.  I've _never_ had a window office.  I'd like to try it out.\n\n&gt;Mari:  (Suddenly getting miffed now that the prize was so close but now seemingly lost.)  Look.  I have a window office now.  I've had one for 10 years.  I'm _used to_ having a window office.  I cannot go back to not having a window office.  But you, you've never had a window office, so you're not used to it.\n\n&gt;Me:  So, I should give you the future window office because you have one now.\n\n&gt;Mari:  Yes.  I deserve the window office because I have one now.  I like looking out the window at the trees and the birds.\n\n&gt;Me:  Oooo!  I want to look at the trees and the birds.\n\n&gt;Mari:  Well, that's the thing.  You won't miss it the way that I will.  I deserve your office.  I'll go tell Rob, OK?\n\n&gt;Me:  So, since I've never had the luxury, I won't miss it, but you, who have had it for 10 years, deserve to have it forever.\n\n&gt;Mari:  Yes.  I'll go tell Rob.\n\n&gt;Me:  I'm messing with you.  I'm not trading offices with you.\n\n&gt;Mari:  (Suddenly very angry.)  You're being difficult!\n\nMari then leaves.  I assume that she's going to talk to Rob and will find out that both of us are getting window offices and so there's no reason for her to want to switch.\n\nMari comes to me the next day.\n\n&gt;Mari:  So, I was thinking about our argument all last night.\n\n&gt;Me:  Yeah, I was surprised you got all upset about it.\n\n&gt;Mari:  Yeah, so I think you should apologize.  And then I'll go talk to Rob, OK?\n\n&gt;Me:  What?  You still think that you deserve my new office instead of me?  You're being silly.\n\n&gt;Mari:  (Suddenly furious.)  You're the one who is being unreasonable!  (Storms off.)\n\nAgain, I assume that she'll go talk to Rob and realize that she already has what she's coveting.\n\nA few days later, I see her in the hallway and I decide to mess with her again.\n\n&gt;Me:  So, I talked to Rob.  It turns out that you were getting the corner window office, and I was just getting a regular window office.  I like the idea of having the corner office.  So, I'm taking you up on your suggestion, and I told Rob that we're switching offices.  So, I'll get the corner and you'll get the normal window.  So, now you should be happy since you're getting your way.\n\n&gt;Mari:  But!\n\nI then walk off.  Again, assuming that she'll talk to Rob about this, but I don't know that she has never had a discussion with Rob on this topic.\n\nWe move into the new building.  We both have normal window offices, and we're neighbors.\n\n&gt;Mari:  I'm still really pissed at you.\n\nShe basically then didn't talk to me for the next few years until she left the company.  I tried bringing it up once again, but she still insisted that I was being unreasonable and had a bad attitude.\n\n",

Did he ask if I would be busy?  No.  Would I get extra compensation for this day of labor?  No.  \n\nSo, I talked to my husband about this.  His response?  \"Fuck no, gurrl!  Tell him no!

I am tired of him using and abusing me.  \n\nMe: Uh...We have known that we were moving, but I didn't know about the exact date until this morning.  \n\nMB: I don't care.  You should have kept your schedule cleared for the month!  This is a part of the 'other duties as expected' part of your contract.\n\nWait...wtf?  No.\n\nI mutter something about 'reasonable duties' and walk out the door.  Of course he hears me.\n\nAbout ten or so minutes later, he approaches me saying that we need to talk. \n\nMB: That was rude!  How dare you say that!  I will give you one option: you can write me a proposal.  If I approve it, you can go.  If I don't approve it or you don't write it and you don't show up that Saturday, consider your employment terminated.\n\nWe end the conversation with me walking a beeline to my cellphone.  I called the other attorney (OA) from the office up to discuss the matter.  We talk about it, he says that MB is an ass, and that when I finally leave I can use him as a reference.  He even mentioned that he would help me find a job.\n\nThen I dropped the biggest bomb of all on OA.  I am done with this shit.  I am out.  His exact words, \"Good for you.  You are a hard worker and don't need to deal with his crap.\"  I have never felt more vindicated.\n\n So, coming this Friday, I am quitting.  I may be losing the job experience and the money, but I will be getting far away from the abuse.  Thank...fucking\n...god.",

Because of that, I have hired someone else who will do the install for me.\n\n**Me**: Oh, okay.\n\n**MB**: You know, I take care of my assistants and their families.  I let **HS** be my process server [one time], and would even consider paying him in the future.  But, I just don't want to deal with someone with that kind of attitude.\n\nAt this point, I am really starting to get irritated. **HS** was doing a *favor* for him in the first place.  And you don't just call someone who is doing *favors* for you at the last moment expecting them to bend to your desires.  It just does not work that way.  I was also getting mad at the way **MB** was insulting **HS**.\n\n**MB**: Seriously, what is going on with him?  Are you two having marriage issues?\n\n**Me**:  Woah woah woah.  First off, if I were having marriage issues, I would not be telling you.  Second, that is none of your business anyways.\n\n**MB**: None of my business?!  [The assistant down the road from us] would tell her boss if she was having marriage issues!  You are my assistant; you're supposed to be like family!\n\nI remained steadfast and told him that while I may be his assistant, he *does not* have a special privilege to my personal life.\n\n**MB** has been pissy with me since that occurred about two hours ago.  And I don't give a fuck.\n\ntl;dr: boss is a prying little shit.",

I'm a bit pooped right now.*\n_____________________________________________________\n* Sidenote: I had moved to this town about a week before I started working for MB, and there was no one I really knew in town besides my SO, **MB**, and **MPD**. The town, small in size, is full of attorneys and their assistants, due to the close proximity to the county and state courthouses.  Even in this small of a town, assistants are constantly shuffling from one firm to another for various reasons.  Hell, there is even an annual assistants only Xmas party held every year!  No one is really bothered by it, except for **MB**, of course.  He had been ranting and raving for the past week about how disloyal **MPD** had been to him.  She just wanted to get the fuck away from **MB** and his bullying, and so she ended up at another firm with a better paying job.\n\n* **MB** also has a rather curious habit.  He will tell his wife (**HW**) every... little... mistake... I make.  He will usually approach me a day or two later, and tell me something along the lines of, \"So, I was talking to **HW** last night about that mistake you did yesterday.  We discussed it and prayed about it.  **HW** says that this shouldn't be happening, and I think I agree with her!  *She* said that you should do this...\"  I always thought it was a bit strange that he would announce it in such a manner.  I have since learned that when begins a sentences with \"**HW** and I were talking about...,\" that I have probably fucked up somehow.  But, I digress.\n\nThis is all relevant later.\n______________________________________________________\nAnyways,\nwithin the first few days of **MPD**'s departure to her new and much more fulfilling job, I began to settle into a routine.  **MB** and I were getting to know and feel more comfortable around each other.\n\nAbout two weeks or so into the job, I receive an early-morning e-mail from **MB**.  I notice that it is also CC'd to his wife (**HW**).  The e-mail has no subject and it contains only one sentence, \"**HW** and I have thought and prayed long and hard about this: We don't want you to associate with **MPD**.  *At all.*\"  \n\nThis was my initial reaction: [http://imgur.com/Z4Q38aj](http://imgur.com/Z4Q38aj)\n\nInstead of dwelling on it, I went on to my normal morning business: some filing here, some Reddit there.\n\nA few hours passed and **MB** came in.  Sometime later, I hear **MB** shouting down the hallway, \"Hey gurrl, did you see my e-mail?\"\n\nPlaying dumb, I waltzed into his office and inquired about which particular e-mail he was asking me about.\n\n**MB**: You know, gurrl, the one I sent you about **MPD**?\n\n**Me**: Yes, I briefly saw it; what is that about?\n\n**MB**: \"Well **HW** were discussing and praying about a few things last night, and we don't want you to associate with **MPD** at all.  I am still mad at her for leaving like this, and I don't want her to know anything that goes on here.  You cannot talk to her, unless I say otherwise.  I still cannot believe that she would do this to me, to us [MB and HW]!\"\n\nMe: *nods in confused agreement*  Um...ok.\n\nUnfortunately, I was following this rule stupidly for too long.  A few weeks ago I contacted **MPD** out of the blue and told her why I had not been talking with her, and I apologized for myself.  After all, who the hell are **MB** and **HW** to dictate who can and cannot be my friend?   **MPD** was understanding and welcomed me back as a friend right away.\n\nSpeaking of **MPD**, we have our first girly date tomorrow.  :)\n________________________________________________________\ntl;dr: boss will never stop being a cunt.\n",

He is actually pretty well known  around these parts for his shitty, entitled attitude.  A whole local government department even had a private meeting to discuss about how to deal with him and his attitude.  Yea, that's kind of sad.\n\nHe is also well-known for taking people out to lunch during the work day, especially, me, his assistant.  No, it's not to be nice or give back; he buys us lunch so he can use it as a future tax deduction.  It's often like 3-4 times per week.  I'd be more appreciative, but I just can't anymore.\n\nAnyways...\n\nHe's is one of *those* people at restaurants.  You know the kind: they want everything a certain way, and hell hath no fury like a diner scorned!  \n\nHe's also that way at *every other* fine retail establishment.  The number of times I have seen him go off on some poor, lowly retail employee is embarrassing.  I have even gone back and apologized for his behavior on multiple occasions.\n\nWhen it happens, you better stand back.  **MB** will start by stating his past job title (working in the State's Attorney's Office) and the fact that he *knows* the top people there (Seriously?  No one gives a shit.  Stop the threats).  If the lowly employee or manager does not back down on the threats, he will take it a step further.  \"I will report you to the [state agency].  They will hear what I have to say, and they will make sure you will fix this problem!  Or else!\"\n\nThe thing is, the retail and restaurant establishments will usually back down when he says this crap.  But, sometimes they won't.  Annnnd....he will always deliver on those threats.  *Always*.\n\nThe worst thing I have seen him try to go after a place for?  An overcooked burger.  Yes, ladies and gents, he threatened to contact not only the State's Attorney's Office on the matter, but he also threatened a full-on lawsuit.\n\n\n**tl;dr** boss is still a cunt.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nMany more stories to come...",

[Click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c8oln/is_respect_too_much_to_ask_for/) for the post.\n\nThis post describes the reason my predecessor left.  I have obscured a few details, but nothing that will detract from the actual story.  Anyways....\n\n\nMy Predecessor (**MPD**) is a lovely, timid woman.  I met her the first day while I trained for her job.  She was nice and taught me quite a few things before she left for good.  We have since kept in touch.\n\nI always knew that she quit, because she had beef with My Boss (**MB**), but I never knew what really happened between the two of them.  I found out the reason today.\n\n________________________________________\n\n\nWithin the first couple of months of **MPD**'s hire, **MB**'s child went into the hospital.  Like, you had to wear surgical masks to even be in the same room.  Pretty severe stuff and relevant in a moment.\n\nNow, **MB** is known for going on jaunts to get out of the office.  On one particular day, **MB** tells **MPD** that they are going somewhere and to hop into the car.  **MPD**, deathly ill with the flu at the time, hops into the car.  The following is the conversation that follows between them (as told by **MPD**):\n\n**MB**: We're going to visit [my child] in the hospital!\n\n**MPD**: But...I don't feel comfortable being around your *extremely sick child* when I have the flu...\n\n*MB proceeds to go off the rails...*\n\n**MB**: Are you *kidding* me?  How dare you be so selfish and disrespectful at a time like this!  When you signed the contract for this job, you agreed to the section labelled 'Other!'  Remember?!  It talks about performing other job opportunities as assigned!  I can't believe this!  If you try this crap on me again, I WILL fire you!\n\n*MPD starts to tear up.  What the hell just happened?*\n\n**MB**: You need to get out of this car this instant and go home.  You will not be getting paid for the rest of the day!  Think of this as a lesson to you.\n\nMPD: But...I...\n\n**MB**: *[whips out phone and gets wife on speaker]*  Would you believe what **MPD** just did to me.  Now I cannot visit my child, because **MPD** ruined it for all of us!\n\n*MPD gets out of the car and eventually starts her way on home, crying, while MB slams the car door like a child and races off down the street.*\n\n****In the end, MB never says anything about the incident, or even attempts to apologize to MPD.*\n\nAnd that is the reason my predecessor left.  \n _________________________________________\n\nWhile telling me about this today, **MPD** became extremely fired up and vowed that she will help me find a job, because she can't believe he pulled the same shit on both of us.  \n\n\nTl;dr: Boss is an irrational cunt.\n\n\nMore stories to come!\n",

Not the \"If your work performance doesn't improve, we will talk about termination\" kind of firing.\n\n\nIt started out with an emergency call from my boss about a client (he's out of town on vacation).  He states that we need to get the client on the phone for a conference call.  He asks me how the day is going, as he is dialing the client.  I mention to him that a client we just lost paid their bill off.  This is the conversation that follows:\n\n**My Boss (MB)**: \"Well, what did they say about me?  About why they did not like me?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Well, I don't think we should talk about this right now...\"\n\nNow, I only said this because the original call was an 'emergency' and we were *in the process* of getting the emergency client on the phone.  \n\n**MB:** \"How *dare* you talk to me like that!  I have *never* had anyone talk to me like that before!  If you do anything like that again, I *will* fire you!\"\n\n**Me:** \"But...\"\n\n**MB:** \"NO!  You need to apologize, NOW!  **NOW**!\"\n\nI don't know what hit me.  So, I stutter a half-hearted apology.\n\n**Me:** \"I am sorry...\"\n\n**MB:** \"I can't believe you would do this to me.  I can't believe it!  Apologize *again*!\"\n\n**Me:**  \"Sorry about...\"\n\nI don't even get a chance to explain myself, and I can only stutter out another apology.  **MB** proceeds to rant on and on about my 'disrespectful' behavior.  \n\nThe best part: A few seconds later, he turns to his family (In-laws, wife, and kids), who are sitting next to him on vacation.\n\n**MB:**  \"Did you hear what she said to me?!\"  *repeats what I said to him*  \"I cannot believe anyone would say that to *me*!\"\n\nAnd with that, the emergency client arrives to the conference call...\n\n\nNow, I was flabbergasted.  In my 10+ years of working, I have never been threatened in such a way and then humiliated.  I did not think the time was appropriate to talk about such petty crap.  I am still at a loss.  Even the other attorneys and assistants in my building cannot believe he treated me in such a way.\n\nThis has just fueled my search for a new job.  ",

He was extremely disorganized, and delays that were caused by this were often blamed on either myself or the other subordinate engineer under him. When I say OR, I really mean mostly me. The other engineer in our group, who had been there a few years, grew tired of this and really was managing his own projects at this point, and bypassing CBA altogether. He wasn't being paid more for managing his own projects, he just wasn't getting his ass chewed because CBA fucked him over in meetings when asked why certain milestones weren't being reached. CBA liked this, because it lightened his workload and made him look better.\n\nFuck that. I'm not doing someone else's job, just because I don't want to get yelled at. I'll just yell back instead.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, a prelude to explain a few things. Have you ever seen those self help books aimed at managers, who want to fix things at work? If you ever interview and your prospective manager starts bragging about how they're reading these books and starting to implement them, walk away. Is your current job asking you to start reading these in a workplace-type bookclub? Update your resume. The president of [Company] who I'm going to call Dumb-As_A-Post from now on, had a hard-on for these things. At one of our monthly meetings, he rolled out the new idea we had to do - The [BHAG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal). It was painful to say the least. Another idea that he got from watching a Youtube video was to implement [20 Time](http://www.9inchmarketing.com/2012/12/10/before-20-time-there-was-15-time-3m/). Basic premise:\n\n&gt;If your idea is beneficial to the company, you can spend up to 20% of your time on it, if you so please. It can be any project you would like to work on, just have the passion to follow it through.\n\nThe problem is, he didn't use it in that manner. See, Dumb-As-A-Post saw it like this: If everyone works on an idea that will be beneficial to the company, they'll save all kinds of money!! So, instead of allowing people to work on projects they come up with that sparks an interest, he had us \"submit\" projects to the admin (himself and the project managers) where they would then be approved or sent back down and tweaked - i.e., we want you to do something else. For a non-creative person like myself, we still had to do this - there was no option to opt out, and just work. Nope, we had to. Not only was participation mandatory, but we weren't allowed to work on this whenever - Once every other month, 2 days were set aside where everyone had to work on their projects. No matter what. Didn't matter what jobs were coming up on deadlines, etc. You're working on your cute little science projects.\n\nSo, with looming deadlines, we were told to turn Outlook to out of office and even set up an auto reply telling vendors, customers, and our electricians they would be contacted the following Monday (it was Thursday). Needless to say, this didn't go over well either. Nonetheless, Dumb-As-A-Post pushed these every 2 months. I was starting to see why everyone in every other division of [Company] hated him.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore I had even started this job, there were metrics for *everything*, probably based on some other book telling him to monitor this and monitor that. I wish I had kept some of the metrics sheets (they were even posted in the bathroom stalls, that way you could read through them in your \"free time\" in there), as they were just ungodly ridiculous. I understand wanting to have numbers to compare to, but there comes a point when it's overboard. One of these metrics that was monitored was the ATC (Assigned Tasks Completed) percentage. Being that we were a [Design-Bid-Build](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design-bid-build) company, we weren't billing our time to the client, that was all coming out of our bid price. So in all fairness, time management is a good thing for a company like this to look at. They just went at it all fucked up.\n\nSee, at the beginning of every week, we were assigned enough tasks to fill up our 45 hours, more than usually though we receive about 48-50 hours of tasks. Either way, at the end of the week a calculation would take place based on the tasks you marked complete out of the amount assigned to you. So, if you had unfinished tasks on Friday afternoon, you had a couple choices. You could let them slide to next week, and take a hit on the metric, or get them done on your own time, and not take the hit. Since this metric was used to calculate your year-end bonus, you can guess what a large amount of the engineers did. See, we not only did this work to keep our own stats up, but one of the drafters may be depending on you to get something done next week so they can do their assigned tasks associated with that same design path. If you didn't have something done, the drafter would go to CBA and say, \"Hey I don't have the material to get this task done.\" and CBA would come back with, \"Well, leave it on your task list and you should have it by Wednesday.\n\nOf course, construction being the beast that it is, things often get shuffled around. This system fucked everyone. And here's the kicker. If you didn't finish all your tasks in a week like above, you still had to finish them or take a hit on your metrics. But, say you get lucky and finish 48 hours of works in 40 hours or so, and it's Friday at noon. You gonna head home for the weekend, get out for a bit? Don't think so. If you finished early, you were then expected to pull more work forward from the next week. So your hard work was rewarded with - more work.\n\nThis all came to a head one afternoon in Dumb-As-A-Post's office, as I had another bi-weekly meeting with him, I'm sure another idea taken from a corporate book on how to connect to your employees. Side note - he actually had 15 minutes a week scheduled into his calendar to walk around and \"converse\" with workers. If you're scheduling social interaction, you're doing it wrong. So, on to the meeting.\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"So, do you have anything else today?*\"\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Yeah, I do actually. I'd like to talk about how work is assigned, along with the [design class homework](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c7d11/fuck_this_shit_part_ii_the_desolation_of_my_will/).\"*\n\nAt this point, he finally closed his laptop, and started listening. During these meetings, he would usually talk with you while answering emails, or doing whatever else on his PC instead of actually listening to you. This was going to be interesting. I continued.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"It concerns me that my performance metrics are based partially on things that are out of my control. Say, if someone else runs into problems with their assigned tasks that are prereqs to mine. Now my metrics are lower because someone else ran into problems that may or may not have been their fault either.\"*\n\n*&lt;Dumb-As-A-Post's eye starts to twitch a bit.&gt;*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"So at this point, it forces people to take personal time that should be spent outside of work on work related tasks, just to keep a metric high enough to get a bonus.\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"Well, my first impression at that point is that you're just not managing your time effectively enough.*\"\n\nOh, fuck you. I can see him shift his weight back in his chair, probably about to lean back and grab one of his self help books off his bookshelf for me. I jump back into it to keep him from doing just that.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Actually, I would say I manage my time very effectively, and that's where the conflict here is. I want to keep work and work, and actually have a home life away from here. If I've work 45-50 hours in a week, I don't see how it can be requested that I work even more just to get a task done because it wasn't ready for me at the beginning of the week.\"*\n\nNow he's pissed. Fuck it, nothing to lose at this point.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"This actually goes right to the other topic I wanted to talk about: Design Class. Why are we required to be doing any work that pertains to this outside of work hours at all?\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"All engineers spend time outside of work hours improving themselves, Lost. I don't see why you think you would be any different...\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"You're correct, engineers with PE licenses do spend about 16 hours a year on continuing education. They're also making six figure salaries. What I'm referring to is that this company wants brand new engineers to spend 6-8 hours of their off time each week working on assignments without pay for this company.\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"Well I don't see a problem here, you're gaining knowledge and experience that you can take with you wherever your career takes you with this class.\"*\n\nNow my eye is starting to twitch. Note that our volume has been escalating this entire time, as both of us are getting frustrated.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Yes, but it's also helping this company, as we discuss the exact design standards wanted here. I'd say that makes it a situation where the company benefits as well, moreso than the engineer actually. Not to mention that it's a mandatory class. If it was optional, I could see your point. I just don't see why I should have to do more work for [Company] after I leave work and drive 35 minutes home.\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"Nobody forced you to live that far away.\"*\n\nI'm losing focus.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"No, but if you're asking me to do company work once I get home, that still is an issue. I have no problem driving that far to work. What I have a problem with is getting home after driving that far and being required to do more work that benefits [Company].\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"Yes, but it still benefits you as an engineer.\"*\n\nThis is going nowhere.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"I never denied that, I'm just stating that it should be paid work, as it benefits this company more.\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"Well, I don't see why you're upset about this, every other engineer has gone through this without complaining. Even I went through this class when I started.\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Well, I guess I actually enjoy being around my family more than I enjoy working.\"*\n\n&lt;INSTANT RAGE&gt;\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"WELL IF YOU'RE SAYING YOU'D RATHER NOT WORK HERE AS AN ENGINEER -\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH. I never said anything of the sort. I simply stated I think it's grossly unfair to be expected to perform company tasks on personal time.\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"WELL IT ISN'T A COMPANY TASK, IT'S A PERSONAL TASK.\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"I guess we're going to have to disagree on that one.\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"Is that all you had this week?\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Yep.\"*\n\nDumb-As-A-Post - *\"OK. Good talk.\"*\n\nHe opens his laptop and goes back to work.\n\n[*&lt;Cue my look&gt;*](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-94cRbBvAcrw/TixtqrttdMI/AAAAAAAAAbY/bWc080Z_TiU/s1600/confused+boy.jpg)\n\nI get up and walk out of his office, and see GeekEng [giving me a look similar to this](http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Shia_LaBeouf_surprised.jpg).

        "text": "[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c4ncn/the_hours_factory_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/)\n\n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c7d11/fuck_this_shit_part_ii_the_desolation_of_my_will/)\n\n[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c84is/fuck_this_shit_part_iii_the_reckoning/)\n\n[Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2x94fy/fuck_this_shit_part_iv_a_new_hope/)\n\n[Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2xc15y/fuck_this_shit_part_v_the_engineer_strikes_back/)\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nI got the job I thought I wanted, turns out it isn't as perfect as I thought. What job is though, *amiright*? At least they didn't try and hide stuff from me going through the interview process th.... Wait. Crap. Well,we'll make the best of it, and get some decent experience nonetheless. \n\nSo my first day, right after the awkward staring contest between myself and HRGuy over minimum hours required, I get introduced to my first co-worker. HRGuy brings me in, we do the, \"Hey, how ya doin',\" etc, etc. I'm going to be sharing this cubicle with one of the other engineers that we'll call Mary, who commutes to my office but works from Office #2 a couple days a week, so save on gas and such.\n\n- *Side note - I would commute to this job once working full time (35 mins. each way - driving east in the morning, and west at night - yay for the little things that annoy you), as the state the corporate office is in has an income tax, and since I personally don't agree with that, I wanted to pay as little as possible. Plus, I wanted to live in my home state where I like the gun laws better, like the CCW permitting process and such.*\n\nSo I sit down, and open my laptop, and get to organizing my desktop the way I want it, etc. I open my Outlook, and see I already have a few emails. Makes sense, IT has probably had the laptop set up for a couple days with my info. So, I start reading through them. The first message I read:\n\n*All - please consider this my official resignation from the position of Electrical Engineer at [Company]. I have decided to pursue other opportunities in this field, etc, etc.*\n\n\"Huh,\" I say. \"Not the first thing you want to see when you start a new job, not exactly a good sign, eh?\" I say over my shoulder in a cynical manner. Remember, construction worker cum engineer. We aren't subtle. \n\n*&lt;Silence&gt;* \n\nMary looks at me out of the side of her eye, smirks slightly, then turns back to her laptop. Hmmm.\n\nSo, on and on, I work part time until I'm out of school, get to the corporate office, start full time, and get to find out about other fun items. During the real orientation, I then learned about the other \"work\" (in parenthesis because I consider it work, they didn't) that I would be expected to perform.\n\nIndustrial electrical design is covered by the NEC (National Electric Code) same as any other electrical work in the country. It's a MASSIVE code book, and has a large amount of nuances, exceptions that are noted in the book, etc. as there should be; electrical work is complex and there are a multitude of different situations one can encounter. I went to school for and was an electrician before I went for my EE degree, so I was familiar with the NEC, but knew that it was a massive book and I could use the knowledge as much as the other new engineers. So, once a week we would meet during our lunch hour (in all fairness, this counted for 1 hour of the 45 during the week, so it did have that going for it), and discuss certain Articles in the NEC. This is cool. What engineer doesn't like to talk about the nuances of their work with other like engineers? That wasn't the shitty part. The shitty part was what came next during out first \"class\". \n\nI started the class with 2 other engineers, one that I graduated with. She was a nice, quite girl (herein known as Quiet Girl) - extremely naive, and to be honest I didn't see her making it very long in the real world. She had never had any job growing up, other than teaching figure skating. Mommy and Daddy bought her a condo near campus so she didn't have to live in a run down apartment like all those other lowly students, etc. But, being a figure skater, she did have a cute ass, so she did have that going for her. And, she did have some of the high grades in the class. However, she would later learn that an electrician on site doesn't care what your GPA was, they just want to know if what they're going to do is legal and if it will work. That's it. She didn't like that.\n\nThe other new engineer was the epitome of geek, and I loved him. Beard, didn't give a shit what he looked like as long as he followed dress code, fun to discuss games with, fun as hell to talk to in general actually. We're going to call him Geek Eng. \n\nSide story:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;So, we're sitting in our Industrial Electrical Design Class, waiting for the teacher to get there. Some people are making small talk, and out of the blue, Geek End says, *\"Do you guys think Jesus was a bro?\"*\n\n&gt;This company is in the middle of [Dutch Reformed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church) country, so making religious jokes is probably a bad idea. Everyone stares at him in shocked silence. Quiet Girl's jaw is resting on her chest almost. He's clearly confused as to why, as he wasn't being derogatory, just being silly. \n\n&gt;....Fuck it, I'm going in.\n\n&gt;/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"Probably. 'You just gotta forgive, brah.' \" I say in my best california surfer dude accent.\n\n&gt;GeekEng - \"Yes, I'm glad someone appreciates the Bro culture as much as I do.\" He says, deadpan.\n\n&gt;Everyone laughed extremely uncomfortably and GeekEng and I embarked on a year long relationship of \"Fuck this place, we should quit. Wait. We need money, let's not quit. Yet.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy project manager, who from here on out will be referred to as CBA (Competent But Asshole), lead the class, as he had a number of years doing design work, and apparently drew the short straw. Moving on. \n\nCBA - *\"Alright, since this is the first class for a few of you, I'm going to go over the requirements.\"*\n\n...Requirements?\n\nCBA - *\"Each week, we'll be covering a different section of the NEC and discussing the design implications that it has for us.\"*\n\nYeah, we've already talked about that. Let's get to it.\n\nCBA - *\"Before each week's topic, you will be required to read some ARTICLES...\"*\n\nThis is in caps, because as he said this, he started handing out the three 4\" binders to each of us that contained the articles for us to read. Clearly not quick or light reading. \n\nCBA - *\"ARTICLES... about the topic that we will be discussing. In addition, these binders also have questions that need to be answered about each subject before we discuss it in class.\"*\n\nFair enough, we need to at least have a rudimentary understanding of the topic before discussing it. I raise my hand.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"So, is there a certain day that will be scheduled for us to do this, or do we just schedule it in for whenever during the week?\"*\n\nCBA looks confused. Not a good sign.\n\nCBA - *\"You should be doing this at night, when you're at home?\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *\"So, you're saying this doesn't count towards the 45 hours a week of work, we're just supposed to do it in our free time?\"*\n\nCBA - [*\"Yes.\"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRp_mVi969I)\n\n*&lt;Uncomfortable silence&gt;*\n\nCBA - *\"...OK, so let's get started...\"*\n\nGeekEng looks at me, and I confirm the look back to him.\n\nFuck this shit.",

I'm an electrical engineer, and I work in industrial design. I like to think I'm what an engineer is supposed to be - a construction worker who came up through the ranks, and then got the extra education to work as the engineer on the jobsite.\n\nI may be a bit young (30) for people to think I have extensive construction experience, but I started working when I was 5.\n\nYes, 5. \n\nMy grandfather was remodeling a college that he bought, and was turning the dorms into apartments. Since my dad wasn't around, grandpa was a good babysitter during the summer. Hence, my construction education. That first summer, I cut every single piece of pipe (copper and PVC) and wire that went into these buildings, in addition to pouring/finishing concrete, cutting lumber, etc. Through the years, I worked with my grandpa on many projects. I worked in his sawmill during middle school, and built industrial warehouses with him in high school. Suffice to say, I've had a bit of experience, and have grown up in the construction industry. \n\nWhile that gives me much more experience and insight compared to most kids who get engineering degrees it seems, it can also put me at an extreme disadvantage - I didn't have to play office politics at all growing up. I had a few other jobs while in high school, but I didn't like any of them - and to be honest, they didn't like me. Working with construction laborers, you become used to the brash, in-your-face style of communication at the workplace.\n\nHave a problem with someone's work? Tell them. Simple as that. If your foreman has a problem with you? You'll know, trust me. While that may sound stressful, I don't see it that way, and I don't think most all construction workers do either. I'd rather have this then sitting in a cubicle, thinking you're doing a good job, then getting blindsided with a shitty performance review 3 months later. Construction workers may be brash, but they'll never be passive aggressive, that's for sure.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, I have my difficulties transitioning to the workplace after getting my degree, and this series of stories will illustrate such.\n\nMy last semester of college, I started looking for employment. There's no shortage of need for engineers around the midwest, so I didn't need to start looking any sooner. However, I want to stay close to my hometown. It's got a population of about 250,000, so it isn't huge, but not small either. This narrowed my search a slight bit as The industrial construction industry isn't the biggest employer for EEs to begin with, but I still have quite a few options. \n\nThe first company I interview with seems to really fit what I'm looking for when I speak to the HR lady (herein referred to as.... HRLady). This was where my construction worker mentality put me at a disadvantage - I was naive enough to actually believe people meant what they said, and weren't just telling white lies. She started in on the, \"[Company] is a family oriented company, who believes time with family is *just* as important as the job we do at work. After all, a happy worker is a good worker!\" and on. Cue me with the doe-eyed look across the table, eating this shit up. I get a decent salary, and normal hours? I'd never known what it was like to get off work before 7:00pm unless it was storming outside and the roof wasn't on the building yet. And this company actually values an employee's time at home with the family? Fucking score!!!\n\nThis is exactly what I wanted with an engineer's job. I get to work on construction sites still, and be home at a decent time to spend with my SO. Couldn't be happier. Until 3 weeks later. I received a phone call from the other HR person in the engineering department (who will be called HRGuy from now on).\n\nHRGuy: *\"Hey LostMyPassword, I know you don't graduate for another month and a half, but we've got a couple projects that we'd like to get started on, and are wondering if you wouldn't be interested in working part time until you graduate?\"*\n\nI had saved up enough money to not work for my last year of college so I could concentrate on my senior design project, which had paid off as we'd finished it much earlier than the deadline called for. So I did have some free time, and the money sounded good.\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *\"Sure, I can fit in some time after classes.\"*\n\nHRGuy: *\"Alright, great. Does Monday work? I'll meet you at Office Site #2 on Monday afternoon to go over the orientation paperwork and get you started if so.\"*\n\nSo, Monday rolls around, and I head into the office to start my **first job as an ENGINEER**!!! Yeah, I was that geeked out over it, like it was some amazing accomplishment of mediocrity. Stupid when you look back. So, we start to go over the company policies as he reads through them as fast as possible, because they're boring as hell, right? Right.\n\nHRGuy: *\"OK, Dress Code - khakis and collared shirt, business casual basically. Good? Good.\"*\n\n&lt;Flips page&gt;\n\nHRGuy: *\"Sexual harassment policy - don't do it, yada yada, you'll have to sign this here saying you won't, etc. There'll be a more formal part of this when you start full time, There's a whole video and everything you have to watch. This is just so you can get started now. Cool?\"*\n\n&lt;Hands me paper, I give it a cursory glance, yep, I won't grab a secretary's ass, got it. Sign, hand back.&gt;\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *\"Makes sense.\"*\n\nIt was at this point that I should've seen that there was a reason that he was moving through this stuff as fast as possible. I'd find out why soon enough.\n\nHRGuy: *\"OK, while you're working part time, you'll be on an hourly wage instead of the salary that was agreed on before, which you'll start receiving when you start full time. Sign here.\"*\n\nHuh? Seriously, you guys can't pay me the hourly equivalent of what my salary would be when I'm not even 2 months away from graduation, and will be doing the same job that I'll be doing then? (It was about 1/2 rate of what my salary was going to be.) Fuck it, whatever. No biggie, it's only a few weeks, then I'll start making good money. I sign it, hand it back. HRGuy starts rattling off more company policies, but I glaze over slightly, mostly annoyed about the wage thing. Then something caught my ear.\n\nHRGuy: *\"And a normal work week at [Company] is considered to be 45 hours, so that's the minimum expected time salary employees are expected to be at the office.\"*\n\nWait. What? [Cue me remembering HRLady](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGH2zNU29FU) \n\n&gt;*\"[Company] is a family oriented company, who believes time with family is *just* as important as the job we do at work. After all, a happy worker is a good worker!\"*^After ^all, ^a ^happy ^worker ^is ^a ^good ^worker! ^^a ^^happy ^^worker ^^is ^^a ^^good ^^worker!\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *\"I was never informed of this before.\"*\n\nHRGuy: *\"It should've been discussed in the interview...\"*\n\n/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *\"It wasn't.\"*\n\nHRGuy seems to be paused, waiting for a response from me. I take it that he's had this happen before. After about 15 seconds of awkward silence, and me waiting to hear an explanation of this fuck-up of a \"policy\", he continues with other HR like duties to have me hear about and sign.\n\nWhat the fuck? I'm not happy about this, and to make it worse, It's the end of the semester, all of the jobs I wanted are now filled with other people that applied for them. Looks like I'm gonna be sticking this one out for a bit.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI know this one wasn't particularly interesting, but it needed to be covered to convey the type of company it was. I apologize for that, and will make the next one more interesting to read.",

Lets meet the characters. \n&gt; The Lollipop Kid: (LPK for short) the main antagonist of this story and my sisters awful boss. Early 40's, overweight, gross, mean, and constantly in a state of \"poor me\". For those curious she looks like the people in [The Lollipop Guild Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KSiyaqnZYs&amp;feature=kp). Most of these stories will be about her, but others may be about \n\n&gt; Bitchy Groomer: (BG for short) Just a generally awful person. Takes advantage of the Lollipop Kid by using her to kick off on her own grooming business. Does mean things along with general nastiness. \n\n&gt; Rad Guy: (RG for short) Cool guy that works with my sister, some stories come from him \n\n&gt; Sister: (sis for short I guess) My sister, stories are all from her, I'm just posting. \n\nSome background. My sister works at a doggroomingplace/doggydaycare/petstore. She and RG man the daycare room, BG is in the grooming room, and TLK does manager things and mostly mans the store. This little opening is just a little introduction to TLK's cute little antics. As boss, she has \n \n* Been caught sleeping on the job while manning the front of the store. When woken up, she replied with \"Oh, teehee I must have fallen asleep\" \n\n* While working the front of the store she is **constantly eating** greasy, messy, generally gross food. Usually this consists of McDonalds, Subway, or whatever local fast-food joint she chose to go to. Also watches Netflix.\n\n* Takes tips that she doesn't deserve. When Dog owners tip, the tips obviously go to whatever department they were in. If they were in the grooming room, the tips go to the groomers ect.... One of the dogs owners tipped and she split it between Sis and RG, then pocketed the extra for not doing a damn thing, then made a big deal of \"I'LL take the less amount\". \n\n* She has 2 greyhounds, at around 14 years old, that shit **everywhere**. She then complains about having to clean up after her dogs everyday. Also refuses to put them down. (they have other serious health issues, too.) \n\n* Says some stupid bullshit then goes \"teehee\" (eg: I only had to clean up 3 piles of shit this morning teehee) Nothing big but still super annoying. \n\n* Has a completely \"poor me\" attitude, the world revolves around her. \n\n* Always leaves people like RG and Sis to run the store, when that's not their job so she can go out to have lunch, then proceeds to leave for 4 hours. \n\n* Completely disregards the rules of her own business, making it hazardous for the dogs and the daycare workers. You need to interview dogs before they admit them with the Daycare (seeing how they react to the handlers, other dogs, sharing, ect...). She will take dogs just randomly.  \n\n* Complains about owning the business. Always says stuff like \"I wish I was just a worker so I could work less hours\" and \"Owning a business is so hard\" when she literally watched Netflix all day \n\n* Just a generally gross person. Never showers, brushes her teeth, doesn't comb her hair (and when she does it is slicked back greasy), no makeup, baggy sweatpants, sweatshirts, you know the type\n \nThis is just an intro, stories only come as my sister tells me, although I have a few lined up. Most will be short because I was not there to experience them (luckily). Sorry for formatting issues or whatever, I'm new at this. And if you know a better subreddit to post this in, let me know. \n\nEDIT- Fixing a ton of editing mistakes \n",

About six months ago I got promoted out of IT into a Manager position on the operations end for a newly formed department that required a lot of technical knowledge.\n\nThe transition between the two departments (which is a novel on its own) was not the easiest thing, but I was able to get through it clean.  After a few month of developing the department things were getting a bit too heavy in terms of a work load so I put in the request to hire my first employee for the department.\n\nAfter getting approval I went to go to talk to my old IT supervisor who was in the process of trying to expand the IT department.  I asked him if he could pass onto me the resumes of people that he may not have hired - at least they have already been screened by our recruiter and maybe I could find someone that could be useful for my position.  I needed someone with a technical background but maybe not an expert which was needed for IT.\n\nThe next day I had a slew of resumes waiting in my email inbox and I started to go through them.  There were a few that looked promising and others that were not very appealing.  I am almost through them all when I come across *the* resume.  I always start reading through the work experience and education without looking at the name just so I dont start forming opinions based on anything else except their work history and knowledge.\n\nI was going through and this resume looked really good - the person had worked in a collection agency before and did some IT work and had some experience in my new particular department.  I then saw that they worked at my old place of employment so at that point I looked up at the top to see the name of the person.\n\nOldBoss\n\nI just sat and stared there and started to laugh - I knew it was a small world but this sort of stuff happens only in TV shows and movies.  I knew this was my chance to get back.\n\nNormal procedure requires a phone interview before an in person but I forego the phone interview and called our recruiter up and asked her to set up an interview with OldBoss ASAP -- I asked her not to mention my name as the person interviewing since we had a past together I told her I didn't want them to act over confident that they got the job I wanted them to be prepared.  The recruiter agreed and a few hours later I had a interview meeting request in my inbox.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI asked one of the other managers if he would be willing to help me out on my first interview.  I gave him the background of the story and he couldn't stop laughing.  I said I wanted him to interview the guy first as like the first round of interviews and then I would interview him second.  He only agreed if I would tell him what would happen in my interview with OldBoss.\n\nSo OldBoss comes in and I make sure I am not seen as he sits with the other manager and \"passes\" the first interview.  The other manager said he asked questions primarily on his knowledge of collections nothing technical so it seemed legit.\n\nThe other manager asked him to come back at 2 if it was possible for the second round of interviews as he would then be interviewing with the person that could be his future boss.\n\n2 o'clock came around and OldBoss was on time (a plus) and he was taken to the interview room.  I decided that I would make him wait 15 minutes before I arrived - maybe it was cruel but I wanted to have my bit of fun.\n\nI walk into the interview room at 2:15 and introduce myself\n\n*Me: Hi OldBoss congrats on passing the first round of interviews - I will be interviewing you on other items related to the position that &lt;other manager&gt; did not cover.  Shall we get started?*\n\n*OldBoss: ..uhm wait...uhm*\n\nI wish I could record the look on his face.  It went completely white and he looked like a deer caught in the headlights.  He just sat there with his mount slightly open and silent.\n\n*Me: Shall we proceed?*\n\n*OldBoss: Yes*\n\n*Me: OldBoss - There are several things you can learn on the job here, the work flow operations, the software we use and you will get the opportunity to make changes to these things if it results in higher efficiencies.  Based on your experience I am not really worried about your abilities at all.\n\nMy foremost concern is creating an environment of learning, positivity and honesty.  You could be my first hire so I need to start right now in establishing that.  I want this place to be something more than a job.  I want you to want to come into work, but for me to create something like that I need to be able to trust you completely and you trust me.  I would need you to be completely honest and I need to have the other managers here also say the same of you.\n\nLet me ask you Oldboss - has there been anything in any of your old jobs where you may have been accused dishonest or unethical?  If so how did you handle these false accusations?*\n\n*OldBoss: I have not been accused of anything in the past, but had I been I would handle it in a professional manner.*\n\nI was thinking of pressing of asking him what he means be a professional manner but I let it slide.  At this point he probably had sweat out about 2 liters of water.\n\n*Me: I see - now something we take very seriously here is sexual harrassment.  This position will require you to go through the manager's sexual harrasment training and not the employee one.  While you will not be any of the agent's direct supervisor or manager you will have some measure of authority over them so thats why its required.  The demographic of our call center agents are primarily female aged 18-25 - this would not be an issue for you, would it?*\n\n*OldBoss: Not at all*\n\n*Me: Good to hear the last thing I would want is to have an employee have a 'fling' or 'one night stand' with another employee.  It causes a lot of drama and headaches.  Trust me at one of my old employers I had my boss sleeping around with the head of HR.  Could you believe something like that - the head of HR and my boss?  Anyways good to hear that - I really want a positive working team here - now lets move on.\n\nI see that you use to be a Manager and Director yourself - why do you want to move down from management?*\n\nHis face was the palest I have ever seen and he was super uncomfortable.  I could tell her wanted out but I wanted to keep him in there as long as I could.\n\n*OldBoss: Its not so much that I want to move down, but its not easy to get those type of jobs so right now I want to get something that I know I will do well in to move back into those roles.*\n\n*Me: If you don't mind me asking - why were you let go from your last position?*\n\n*OldBoss: We were bought out by a company and my job position became redundant so after a year I was let go.*\n\n*Me: Hmm - you did have a full year to show your value though - interesting.\n\nSo you had originally applied for an IT position here but this position isnt strictly IT - its more about operational items and some technical reasoning and logic.  Is this something you would really want to do?  Or is IT going to be something you will still want to do?*\n\n*OldBoss: IT is where my heart is, but I love new challenges and want to succeed at everything I put my all into.  I like the fact that this is a new department and will be growing - I want to be part of that growth.*\n\n*Me: One last thing and I will let you go.  I am a little over 10 years younger than you - would that be an issue?  Have you had a younger boss before?  Again I rather you be completely honest over giving me the answer I would like to hear because I have seen it before and even here sometimes people have a hard time with a boss thats much younger than they are.*\n\n*OldBoss: I am young at heart so things like that really do not make a difference to me.  Each person is different and thats what matters.  I rather have a great boss who is 20 years younger than me than a horrible boss who is older.*\n\n*Me: What about a former employee -- I was your employee for a long time do you think that would be possible?*\n\nAt this point OldBoss was completely speechless he had wetspots under his arms and they wre about the size of cantaloupes.  He didnt say anything at all to that question and just looked down.\n\nI decided to let him go - he already was going through a rough time having lost his job I didnt want to rub it in more.  \n\nAs I was escorting him out of the building he kept looking down and couldnt look me in the face.  \n\n*Me: OldBoss - I know you treated me like shit before I left.  I know thats why you can't look me in the face right now, but I do want to let bygones by bygones.  Honestly you are beyond qualified for this job and I do want to hire you, I just dont know if you would be willing to take the job.  I honestly would not seek to get back at you for anything done in the past.  I think Karma has more than taken care of that part for me.  I just want someone who will work hard and be honest.  If you are willing to do that the job is yours - let me know in the next 48 hours if you wish to accept it or not.*\n\nOldBoss finally looked up - he had a look of shock on his face.  What I had said was true - he was the most qualified and would probably do quite well - Life had brought him down and humbled him to a point where he was willing to work hard again.\n\n*OldBoss: Wait, really?  I will need some time to think about it.  I will let you know soon.  Thank you for the offer.*\n\nHe extended his hand out and I shook it and we went our separate ways.\n\nThe next night I received an email from OldBoss.  He apologized profusely over his behavior and told me everything that had happened since I left.  The old HR head moved on from him and found a different 'sugar daddy' for herself and his marriage was barely holding on by a thread. He wanted to move on from everything that he did and had happened to him past few years.  As much as he needs the job and knows its a good opportunity for him he would not be able to come in every day and look me in the face.  The guilt would be too much for him still.  He thanked me for the chance and that he was happy that I was able to move on and up with my career and wished me nothing but success.\n\n\nI replied thanking him for his honesty and accepting his apology and that if he ever needed him he was more than welcome to reach out.\n\nAnd with that Karma had closed the loop on this crazy chapter in my work life.  I ended up hiring a different person who has been amazing and I do not regret for a moment hiring.\n\n",

        "text": "Quick Background:\n\nI worked as tech support for a collection agency for five years - I've seen my share of nonsense all around.  Part 1 of this story deals directly with myself and my ex-boss.  He was the head of IT and was the one who hired me.  For the first two years there he was a good boss, I learned a lot (albeit self-taught) and was starting to make a career for myself in the tech/IT world.  During the last year though my relationship with my boss changed completely and this is where I start my tale.....\n\nIt was a breezy spring day - I remember it vividly I had just come back in from picking up some snacks from the 7-11 down the street.  Looking on my list of things to do I saw I had a pending ticket to check one one of the tape backups that should have completed.  My boss generally came in a lot later in the day (around 11am) than I did, but he was the boss he could do as he pleased I felt.\n\nI started on my way to our server room, its a small closet of servers in there.  The room could hold three people at max, but it was a small size company so there wasn't a need for racks and racks of equipment.  As I worked the KVM switch on the console in the server room to connect to the backup machine I switched over to our camera system.  We had cameras all over our main suite and we had three cameras in a secondary suite that used to be a second office, but after downsizing was just used as a storage facility.\n\nSomething was off though today - the lights were on in the other suite - that never happens only 4 people have access to that suite.  Myself, my boss, the owner of the company and the head of HR/accountant (its a small company so people wore multiple hats)\n\nAs the feed rotated between cameras angles - I found out why the lights were on - my boss was in there along with the head of HR.\n\nShe was on her knees - he was standing up - her head bobbing up and down -- you get the picture of what was going on.\n\nI felt a knot in my stomach - I mean like every guy I've seen my fair share of porn and all but I had no interest in seeing my boss getting 'serviced' by her of all people.  Not to mention my boss was married with two kids.\n\nI quickly switched to the backup machine went about doing the rest of my tasks and hurried back to my desk to continue my day the best I could.  I told myself that whatever they do is really none of my business and I shouldnt get involved.  More importantly who could I go to? HR -- she was the one who was on her knees!!\n\nA few months pass and my boss and her are basically in that other room almost every day for an extended period of time.  It started to effect my job as people kept looking for my boss and couldn't find him.  I was getting dumped with more and more work as he wasnt able to do his end of things so left them for me to do.  After a while it was pretty obvious to the whole office what was going on between the two of them but since the company was on thin ice no one said anything as my boss and her were two people the company needed to stay afloat.\n\n\nI started to look for other jobs as my boss started to treat me really bad during this whole sequence.  Subtle jabs at my performance (which was great but he kept putting down so he could justify not giving me a raise) and not so subtle jabs at my life at the time.  I was in my late 20s and was getting by but I was single and being able to be completely financially independent/debt free was still some time away considering how little I was getting paid at the time.  But it was a tough time to even have a job so I did my best not to complain.\n\nAfter a few months of dead end interviews and offers of jobs that paid less and worked me more I finally landed a great new job that paid me significantly more and gave me a lot more responsibilities and new tasks.\n\nMy new employer wanted me to start the next day but I felt it was proper to at least give 2 weeks at my old job.  I didn't really feel I owed it to my now old boss but the owner of the company was always great to me and always took care of me and if anything I felt I owed him the courtesy of two weeks.\n\nI walked in the next day with my resignation letter typed up and I handed it to my old boss.  He looks over it and reads it and just shrugs his shoulders and sets it aside and doesn't say a word.  I sit down at my desk just adjacent to his and get started on my day - at this point I have also emailed HR and the owner about my two weeks as well.  After 45 minutes of quiet I finally speak up:\n\n*Me: uhm, so OldBoss did you want to talk about my resignation letter?*\n*OldBoss: Whats there to talk about?  Are you leaving for more money?  If you think you can get a raise here by threaten to leave - think again buddy.*\n\nI was shocked - I know plenty of people leverage that but I never have nor do I ever want to pull that sort of stunt.  Even if the new job paid the same amount or just a little more I would have left for the opportunity of growth there - getting a 28% increase in pay was the proverbial icing on the cake.\n\n*Me: No - its not about the money I will be getting paid more at my new employer but its time I moved on there is nothing left for me here to learn and I have to think more about whats best for me going forward.  They actually wanted me to start today, but I said I need to put in two weeks I didn't want to leave without helping you transition and possibly help train a new hire or even you on some of my daily tasks*\n\nAt this point my old boss calls the HR lady and asks her to come into our office\n\n*OldBoss: I don't know if I need to hire anyone I am sure I can handle everything you do and not have to spend money on someone new.  I know you don't want to hear that but its true.  Oh here is HR Lady -- hey so techcollector is giving his two week notice so he says just wanted to let you know*\n\n*HRLady: oh yeah he emailed me.  So you are leaving?  You know you wont be able to be on those websites and chat with your friends all day like you are here.  You'll be expected to do actual work.  You sure about wanting to leave?*\n\nI was about to go off on them but thats what they wanted I somehow kept my patience and replied\n\n*Me: yeah it will be nice not having to kill time by having to do all that I'll be challenged and will be doing a lot of new things at the new place so I am looking forward to it.  I was just telling OldBoss that maybe he should put up a job posting for a replacement so I can help train before I leave.*\n\n*HRLady: Maybe if you showed some initiative you could have been asked to do more here*\n\nAt this point I did lose it \n\n*Me: Sorry maybe I should have just fucked my way up to the top right?*\n\nThat just cut through the air and it was dead silent.  I knew I probably shouldn't have said that but it hit home.  The HR Lady left the office right there in a huff and my boss was quiet the rest of the day.\n\nThe rest of the week passes by and its the following Monday - no job posting has gone up.  I ask my boss if he plans to put it up because if he doesnt plan to then if it would be ok for me to just leave now since I would like to start at my new job asap.  He laughed and said he knew I wasn't going any where and that I should be more worried about doing my current job than some make pretend job I have.\n\nI was thinking of quitting right there but I had a week left - I rather not say I quit a job like that in the future and I felt it would be far sweeter to go through the motions of getting my final check and all on the final day and leaving with no replacement and no way for me to not tell them 'I told you so!'\n\nThe next day though the HR dept from my new company called my old company for employment verification and to have some paper work faxed over.  Standard stuff I was in the office working when HRLady came storming in.\n\n*HRLady: Where is OldBoss?*\n\n*Me: Its 10 am when was the last time he got here before 11?  He \nshould be here in an hour.  Why something urgent?*\n\n*HRLady: I need to talk to him right away when he comes in.  You better not waste a second in letting me know when he gets in*\n\nShe storms off and I am not sure why she was all in a tiff, but an hour later my old boss shows up and I tell him HR Lady was looking for him. \n\nShe walks into our office and I get asked to leave the room.  I leave and I am just chilling with some co-workers and I walk over to HR Lady's office and was talking to the other accountant who shares an office with HRLady.  Acct was one of my few friends in the office and she was super happy I was leaving she couldnt wait to leave herself.\n\n*Acct: Oh man techcollector you really did it now.*\n\n*Me: What did I do?*\n\n*Acct: You're quitting! That's what!  She didn't believe you but we got a bunch of calls and faxes from your new company requested certain documents to be sent over ASAP today and it freaked her out.  She screamed actually - 'He's actually fucking going that asshole!\"*\n\n*Me: So I guess they never took my word and my letter I sent over a week ago - it took that phone call to get it through their heads.  She is talking to OldBoss right now - probably over that.*\n\nI go back into the office I see OldBoss frantically putting up job postings all over every free website for postings he can.\n\n*Me: So you're going to hire someone after all then I take it?*\n\n*OldBoss: Yeah well you aren't given us much time here to find someone good*\n\n*Me: Well I told you last week, you chose to waste a week not believing thats not my fault.  I will help train whoever you hire up until the 28th but after that I am gone.*\n\nOver the next day people come in to interview and a guy is selected I have 3 days to train him.\n\nI spend the days training him - he didn't seem too enthused by all the various processing tasks - 1/2 the job was on report processing and handling of new accounts and the other half was IT.  I am not sure how the job presented itself but he kept asking about various IT aspects that the job didnt really include.\n\nMy Final Day - OldBoss is happy to see me go.  He was able to hire someone at less pay and would do everything I had did.  He stops being subtle with his jabs and is now constantly just making fun of my abilities and talents.  I felt kind of bad for him having to do that but I do my best not to bite back at him.\n\nIts just before lunch I look at the new guy and ask him if there is anything else he wants help with and he says no.  I ask OldBoss then if I can just call it a day and get my final check and go home.  I would like to just take it easy and maybe get a massage before I start my new job the next day.\n\nOldBoss is surprisingly agreeable to this but says instead of paying me 8 hours for the day that he was going to have the final check cut for the 4 hours I was there.  I was fine with that though it was always customary to pay the full day even if the employee went home early on their final day as a final gesture of good will and faith.\n\nAs I left the parking garage I told myself - never again from him.  I dont care if he calls, texts, emails - there is no way I will ever contact or talk to this person again in my life.  After all he put me through and quite frankly all that I took (and shouldn't have) I have no reason to entertain him ever again.\n\n\nAnd then Karma came knocking...\n\nI am at the masseuse when I hear my phone go off.  Judging by the ring tone I realize its OldBoss and I let it go.  The phone does not stop ringing - the masseuse asks if I would like to pick it up - I said to her to hand me the phone so I can turn it off.  Sure enough besides the 4 phone calls there were several texts.    I get 5 more phone calls and several texts and ignore them all.\n\nThe next day I am at my new job and I get a text from Acct asking me to call her on my lunch break so I did.\n\n*Acct: So you have to hear this.  You wont believe what happened after you left yesterday?*\n\n*Me: I am curious because OldBoss kept calling me over and over and sent me a ton of texts I havent read them yet but I can only imagine its related*\n\n*Acct: Yeah!  So about an hour after you left.  The NewGuy - your replacement came back from lunch and quit right on the spot.  Said the job wasn't what was describe in the ad and that it would be a step back for his IT path if he was there.  OldBoss was livid because he had no idea what to do and couldnt train any one new.  He has been going all over the office this morning trying to figure out things.  We have our clients demanding to know why their things are not ready and what happened to you the whole thing.  OldBoss is completely losing it and the owner is not happy.*\n\n*Me: wait really? he quit? thats freaking awesome.  Karma really bit OldBoss in the ass there.  I haven't picked up a single phone call or responded to a single text and I dont plan to.  this is could not have worked out better or happened to a nicer guy.*\n\n*Acct: the owner has been on him all morning demanding whats going on and HRLady is taking some of the heat of it as well since you took care of some of the reports she needed.  Oh its a glorious mess all of it.*\n\nAnd with that I was happy - I didn't have to get back at my old boss - Karma took care of it for me.  I just didnt expect it to happen that fast though.\n\nBut Karma wasnt done with my old boss.... that is going to be in part 2",

        "text": "2011, Fresh faced designer, having graduated from architecture school in 2010. Did internships during college, but just landed a job at an up-and-coming architecture firm. Interview went great; got real casual with the two owners - knew I would get the job. They asked me what I wanted to make. I said $17-$18 an hour. Thought that was fair based on what my graduate program classmates were making.  \n  \nBoss 1, let's call him Joe.  \n\"Don't undervalue yourself!\"  \n  \nWow... I think.  \n\"What am I worth to you?\" I ask.  \n\n\"$26-$32.\"  \n  \nJesus Christ. \"Awesome,\" I say.  \n  \nLong interview story short, they wrap it up, and call me like a month later to offer me the job. They e-mail me an offer letter, and to my surprise the salary is listed at $24,000 annually, or around $11.50 an hour, for a college graduate with internships under her belt. (That paid much more, too.) \n  \nI call them back and ask what's up with the salary.  \n  \nBoss 2, let's call him Mike.  \n\"That's all we can offer you. I'm sorry.\"  \n  \nMe, thinking I need this job in order to get credit with my graduate program and for ADP (architecture licensure exams), begrudgingly accepts.  \n  \nStart my first day. Seems like a good place, except for the really cold treatment I am getting from my new bosses for having asked about the salary. Finally, later in the day, thy bring me into the conference room and announce they have raised my salary to $26,000 annually. I was slightly happier, but felt I was still worth way more -- according to my classmates and payscale.com.  \n  \nEvery day I was learning more (decided to write it off as a learning experience). Mike is really cold towards me still, treats me with hostility. Joe is a very casual, easy going guy, who was a bit sleazy with the casual attitude that was a cover for his games. There's a couple other employees, all male. I'm the only female.  \n  \nI'm working my ass off, staying late, coming in early, and being an all-around awesome employee. I start to notice that I have to try harder anyway, because it's a boys club. (There was one female who left just prior to me starting..... which was convenient.... I'll explain why later.)  \n  \nThe guys chatted a lot. Things like \"Females should have to take an exam to have a baby\" were said by my boss, Joe. I sat there, clearly uncomfortable, ignoring them. They were all about the \"cool atmosphere and cool people\" so they only hired people they thought would fit the bill. Mike said similar things about how women getting a degree is a waste because they'll just end up having a baby and never go back into the field. The list went on and on.  \n\nAn intern student guy starts working there, seemingly doing a great job, but come to find out, he was half-assing all his great work. We didn't find out till after when we would have to go into the files and everything was a rats nest and virtually a disaster. It's my job to work on it, therefore it's my job to fix it. I spend nights until 1 AM working on it, for days. One day, before it's finished, I come in and my computer is logged in with the file open. My boss takes me into the conference room to tell me I made an awful file and how all my other work is poor too. I give point after point and reason after reason how I am good. And I explain how this kid fucked it up, and I was fixing it.  \n  \nA couple weeks later, I receive an e-mail about how I fucked something else up, that was sent to the whole office. I wasn't even working on this project. I was humiliated. I had walked into work on my birthday to be lectured and yelled at, when I was working my ass off - and I knew I was doing well.  \n  \nSo, at another point, I find out from a coworker that does the same job as me that he makes double what I make. I find out my bosses give themselves $115k each in salaries while I am making $12.50 an hour for an entire year, aka $26,000, and can never ask for a raise because they find problems with me just in time for each review. The interns made $12.00** (fixed to correct pay, sorry) an hour. I was a full time employee with health insurance (that I paid half for, in addition) and more prior experience than most people who came into my job with.\n\nAt that point, and with dozens and dozens of comments that were utterly degrading and inappropriate, I decidedly to file a discrimination complaint. I wait days for them to get it, before I say anything - because without receiving the letter, they can claim they fired me for other reasons than from receiving the letter. (It's illegal to fire me after getting it.)\n\nThey take me into the conference room and tell me they are utterly confused as to what happened and how they feel betrayed. I tell them about the pay, about the comments I kept record of, and everything. They claimed they thought I was asking for $17,000-$18,000 annually. I told them that didn't even make sense because that's either at or below minimum wage. They claimed they didn't understand it either, and I called them out on what they originally said I was worth. They said they meant $26,000 to $32,000, to which I responded, you originally offered me $24,000. They had no good reasoning for any of it.\n\nSo, I told them I am taking them to court for all the emotional damage they inflicted, as well as for everything else. (They had had me in tears for degradation many times, that weren't my fault, and were made public. But they never did it to the guys.) All the stress and crying caused gall bladder issues to surface in a way that sent me to the ER, etc.\n\nI get to mediation, which had to come before court. They somehow have the mediator, who is supposed to have no bias, on their side. She's telling me that by not asking them if I was paid less because I am a woman made my point invalid. She told me my case wasn't worth even a couple thousand. In the end, I came out with about $6k, which made my salary that year $32,000. I accepted because court fees and time were honestly too much, and in reality, it at least made my salary the higher end of what they claim they said I was worth... Anyhow.\n\nLater on, I found out that the woman who worked there before me left because she was pissed off, too. It turns out they needed to have a woman at the company at all times for tax benefit reasons, and that's why I was hired when it was such a male oriented place. \n\nJust as a point, I currently work in an all male place, and the guys are great. I've been here 2 years. I would never think to automatically go to court over something like this - but after being yelled at, treated awfully, etc., I did it as a last resort. If I had quit, I would not have been entitled to my dues. \n\n",

        "text": "A few years back right after I graduated high school, I landed a job at a small non-profit organization I will call DerpCorp as a Database Administrator (most of my job ended up being file clerk in the end). My job mainly consisted of managing our small MS Access database, making occasional changes, inputting data, and basically making sure the system was up and running. The rest of my job was filling away our client files at each of the offices (a job that could be finished within about an hour).\n\nDerpCorp's purpose was good enough, helping those in need in the community and for a short time I actually felt proud to work there.\n\nSoon enough though, I started to learn how bad the company actually was...\n\nThe office had about maybe 100 employees and had several small offices across our state with about a dozen employees in each office. Due to the companies size, the entirety of IT was managed by one person who we will name ITManager. He would normally work from home, and rarely ever showed up at the office, and we he did he always acted bitter and angry.\n\nI worked the only other tech related job at the company so anytime a tech question came up I would try to help, but would then get berated by management because it wasn't within my job description/duties..\n\nLets start with the main villain of this story, she was the Director of Quality Assurance and managed my position and about a dozen other people. We will call her QAManager.\n\nQAManager was a mousy lady, spoke very faintly, normally fairly pleasant to be around at first until you actually got some time to work with her...\n\nAs I said before, my job was fairly limited, so constantly I would find myself finished with my daily workload and would ask her if she had anything else for me to do. She would respond \"Just find something to do\", so I would go around seeing if any of the other departments needed help with anything, and when nothing came up, I would go back to my desk and browse the web (facebook, at the time digg, twitter) to pass the time.\n\nIt was about a few weeks in while working that I was called into her office. I walked in and noticed she had a stern look on her face as I sat down in front of her.\n\nQAManager: Gunhaxx I called you in here because I was told by ITManager that you accessed non-work related sites on company time.\n\nMe: I did yes, but it was only during downtime when I had no other tasks assigned for me to work on, and they were only sfw sites.\n\nQAManager: That is unacceptable! You are only allowed to use your work computer and internet for work related reasons. If I catch you again accessing non-work related sites you will be reprimanded.\n\nNote this was before the smart phone era, so all I had was your standard flip phone with no apps or internet\n\nMe: Alright I understand and it will not happen again, but what do you want me to do when I have finished all of my work?\n\nQAManager: I don't care as long as its work! Clean if you must!\n\nMe: ....that's not part of my job description...\n\nQAManager: You will do as I say, you should be thankful for this job....Oh and I will also need your work computer password..\n\nMe: wait what?! Why do you need my work computer password?\n\nQAManager: To make sure you are only using your computer for work, everyone in the office is now required to give me their computer passwords so I can make sure no body is slacking off.\n\nMe:....ok....\n\nSo after the meeting I brought the issue up to HR and the ITManager and this ruling was approved, so now everyone had to give QAManager their work passwords so she could \"effectively manage\".\n\nA few days later I came in a little bit early then everyone else, as I pulled into the parking lot I noticed QAManagers car already parked.\n\nI walked into the reception area of the office and heard mumbling coming from the back of the office.\n\nI slowly walked to the back cubicle area and found the QAManager sitting at one of my co-workers desks on their computer, checking their browsing history and work email account.\n\nShe turned to me to give a sneer and went back to looking around on the co-workers computer.\n\nAbout a week later we were all called into an all-hands meeting with the QAManager at the lead.\n\nQAManager: As you all know, we have been keeping close tabs on everyone's email and browser history and that company policy is that all company equipment must be used for work related purposes only...I have found that all of you are misusing your company provided equipment for personal use...thus to put a stop to this non-sense we are blocking all access to the internet from your company computers. If you need do any work related research you must do it from my workstation with under my watch...\n\nAll of my co-workers including myself groaned in unison\n\nQAManager: Also! To prevent fooling around at work, we are banning all personal cell phones, music players, radios or any other personal electronic devices from the office. Please leave your personal electronics in the car before coming into the office..",

        "text": "Last Monday I was meant to order the owner of the company a new phone.  I forgot.\nYesterday his assistant emailed me asking what the status was.  I replied \"It's on backorder.  I will have it ready as soon as it comes in.\"  Good cover, me. NO ONE WILL EVER FIGURE IT OUT.\n\n\nToday I got to work and set about actually ordering it.\n\n\nStep 1: figure out the carrier and the type of phone it is.  This required I sneak into this office and go through his bags to find his phone.  He was in a meeting in the next room over.  This gave me the nervous sweats.  Found phone in the fanny pack.  Step 1 complete.\n\n\nStep 2: Register the mobile account online so I can order a new one.  This sent a temporary password to the phone.  Phone was in his fanny pack.  I ran to his office.  He was in there.  \nI said \"hello!  Would you like me to take a look at your phone to see if I can fix it while we wait for the replacement?\"\nHe got very excited and said \"yes! I think it's in my car.  Here are my keys.\"\nBut.  It was only inches away. In that nylon bag full of used tissues.\n\n\nI wandered around for a minute and came back to him.  \"It's not in your car...\"\nHe said \"I must have left it at home.  Call my house manager.\"\nBut it's still just right there...so close...\n\n\nI called his house manager.  \"Hi-a! I need the phone. Is it there?\"  She looked around for a while and called me back, \"I don't see it.  I think he probably put it in his fanny pack.\"  YES!!! I said \"oh, alright. I'll see if he has it with him...\"\n\n\nI went back up to his office.  He wasn't there.  There was someone in the fancy bathroom next to his office, and I assumed it was him.  I didn't want to get caught snooping so I asked his assistant to look for me.  She found the phone.  Step 2 complete.\n\n\nStep 3: Order new phone.\nCan't order a new phone online after registering.  Why? Because the account was set up without the necessary permissions.  There's no way to get the necessary permissions.  I called the customer service lady.\nI said \"I'm calling from this man's IT dept and I need to get the permissions on this account online so I can order a new phone.\"\nShe wouldn't talk to me.\n\n\nLady: I'll call him to be sure I'm authorized to talk to you.\n\n\nMe: What number are you calling?\n\n\nLady: I can't tell you.\n\n\nMe: I'm 100% sure whatever number was set up is not going to be his number.\n\n\nLady: I can call someone else on his contact list.\n\n\nMe: Who is on that list?\n\n\nLady: I can't tell you.\n\n\nMe: Anyone who would have been set up as an Account Manager for this account doesn't work here anymore. IT is all new people since Jan 1.\n\n\nLady: I can email him a form to set you up.\n\n\nMe: What email address are you sending it to?\n\n\nLady: I can't tell you that.\n\n\nMe: Don't do anything at all.  Don't call. Don't email.  I'll have him call when he's not busy.\n\n\nLady emailed anyway! It went to a distribution group which includes me, my boss, and a few executives (none of whom are the owner, thank the gosh). But now I've got 3 executives asking questions, and still haven't been able to order a phone.\n\n\nI replied to the email, saying \"Smilezformilez does need access to this account. This is an urgent matter. Please resolve immediately\".  The lady called me back and said \"I got confirmation that I can speak to you about this.  I'll put the order in now.\"  BOOM.  Order complete.  Day saved.",

        "text": "In 2007 I worked as a recruiter at a major US Trucking company.  These are the tales from that job.\n\nSo it's middle of the summer, and as is the normal, the directors go away for a big summit meeting/team building retreat to discuss the outlook on driver retention vs hires, to set the projection for what we actually need vs what we're generating, and whose division is getting more heads (and have a little work party atmosphere without the rest of us).\n\nLike the old adage goes: if the parents are away, the kids will play.  No directors and no VPs on the floor meant food days, Nerf football toss, Youtube, Facebook, and all the other trappings of having a free office.  I got beaned in the head twice with a nerf ball, on the 2nd time it went into my desk and stayed there.  Other than that, it was a week of excellence.  People were de-stressed and we actually got MORE done than usual.\n\nThen the management team comes back and we had to put the toys away (GROOOOOAN!)  But there was something different.  Not one manager would talk openly about their meeting, or any projection, the only answer was \"get back to work\".\n\nThere was one manager in particular (whom I'll refer to as GM) that did not return for 3 weeks....and several people asked where he was but no answer was given.  \n\nIt wasn't until much later that I had found a memo to me from one of my soon-to-be laid off coworkers (as was I to be) about what happened.  It turns out that GM had a few too many drinks and passed out in his hotel room.  His dickhead roommate (DM, who was a floor VP at the time) decided it would be funny to disrobe, draw on the skin of, spray shaving cream on, and take pictures of GM.  He THEN went on to get a bunch of other directors (including female directors) to his hotel room and parade them around naked, passed out GM.  When GM came to, he was visibly and very noticeably angered, but DM and the other VP on the trip had told everyone to keep quiet or lose their jobs.\n\nWEEEEELLLLLLL we get to the point in time where people are getting laid off, and one of the managers to be laid off writes a memo to the CEO, outlining what happened that week.  An investigation is launched, as are lawsuits, and DM is fired.  The other VP that threatened everyone with their jobs gets knocked down a couple pay grades, and other people get disciplinary action on their records.  GM ended up leaving the company.\n\nTL;DR- A job-related offsite retreat function is no excuse to go Animal House on someone.",

        "text": "A few years ago, I was working for a retail company's corporate office.  I was one of three people in my position and the most senior in that position, the 3rd guy was hired on the day this happened.  My cubical was fully stocked in supplies.  The day the third person was hired on (A Friday) I was rear ended in a horrible multi-car wreck.  It wasn't my fault, I was the first car hit and hit so hard that I was slammed into the car in front of me.  To make it worse, the freeway was closed down for another wreck, I was at a complete stop and the car that hit me was going approximately 50 MPH.\n\n\nSo I was on short term disability for three months.  Kind of needed to recover from rather severe injuries.  I knew that they had hired on a temp to cover for me while I was out.  I gave notice to my bosses that I was returning the week before I did.  \n\n\nWhen I returned I found that the temp wasn't actually a temp, but she was going to not only remain in my cubical, but she was also going to remain in my job.  I was put into an empty cubical.  Well, not only was it empty, but it was the cubical that we had used for trash.  There was a chair in that cubical and the chair's cushion was stained, ripped, and most of the padding had been removed, the arm rests were destroyed.  It was one of the most uncomfortable chairs that I had ever sat on.  The chair was placed in that cubical because we had no where else to put it and my bosses had been working on getting that chair thrown away.  I had no computer, phone, pens, or any other item needed to complete my job.  I asked my supervisor: \"When can I expect to get supplies to do my job?\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"I don't know.\"\n\n\nMe: \"So what is my job?\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"Same job you had before you left.\"\n\n\nMe: \"When is the temp leaving so I can take my old cubical?\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"She's not leaving and that's not your cubical.\"\n\n\nMe: \"So when, again, am I going to get the supplies to do my job?\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"I don't know\"\n\n\nMe: \"Do I have a job anymore?\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"Why would you ask that?\"\n\n\nMe: \"There is a woman who was hired to take my job while I was out following medical leave for injuries inflicted on me by a driver too dangerous to drive, and \nnow that woman is in my cubical, still doing my job and I have no supplies, not even a chair to sit in.  I think the question of 'Do I have a job?' is a valid one.\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"You have a chair.\"\n\n\nMe: \"We tried throwing that chair away.  You don't get to spend over a year trying to throw away a chair and then give it to me and tell me it's as good as anyone else's.\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"Today you're job is going to this list, find the documents on this list and scan them.\"\n\n\nMe: \"And where are these documents located?\"\n\n\nThis is a common part of busy work of the job.  Each week we, for tax purposes, had to scan every document that came across our desks.  The Supervisor ran a list whenever busy work was needed to see what wasn't scanned and have someone go through the files and pull the documents and re-scan them.  The Supervisor leads me to an empty cubical, with a perfectly good chair, here's the documents, pointing to twenty plus boxes stacked up.  Now, my supervisor visited me when I was in the hospital the day after the wreck.  She knew as well as anyone else that in that wreck I broke BOTH my shoulders.  I even had shoulder surgery on my right shoulder (and I am...or at least was...right handed).  \n\n\nMe: \"Seriously?\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"This was part of your job before and you have the document from your doctor saying you're fit to do your job.\"\n\n\nMe: \"I'm still in physical therapy, I'm coming back from breaking two shoulders and half my ribs and your first job is to have me pick up and move heavy boxes when it should be a physical lite job of mostly sitting?\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"You don't have a computer to do your job on.\"\n\n\nMe: \"There's three people in my position who aren't me.  One of  them is a man about my age who looks to be healthy enough to do a physical job.  Seems to me you can have him do this and I can do my primary job.\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"I'm not doing that.\"  And she walks off. \n\n\nMe, I look at the chair in this empty cubical, I remember my \"new\" chair and figure, \"This cubical is empty, no one is using this chair, my chair sucks.\"  So I push this chair out of the cubical.  The supervisor sees this and stops me.\n\n\nSupervisor asks what I'm doing and I explain to her what I'm doing.  She says \"That chair is for managers.  You can't have it, you have a chair.\"\n\n\nMe: \"If you believe that my chair is as good enough for anyone to use, then you use it.  Use it for today and today only and I will drop it forever.\"\n\n\nSupervisor: \"No, put this chair back, and return to work.\"\n\n\nSo I put the chair back and look at my list and the boxes.  My arm is still stiff at the elbow and at the shoulder it still hurts, and I can no longer feel it.  In order to do the job that I have to do, I have to move one box from one side of the cubical to the other in order to open it.  Worse, the first box I needed wasn't on top.  I don't do this quickly or quietly.  Three months prior this would have been nothing.  On this day, it felt like I was moving boulders.  \n\n\nA couple hours later my Director summons me over to her.  Confused I walk up to her.  This is the first time I've seen her since the day of the car wreck.  She has me follow her to HR.  It seems my supervisor made a complaint to HR and my Director about me and my attitude.  So I'm sitting in the office of the HR VP.\n\n\nHR: \"What is your problem today?\"\n\n\nMe: \"I'm having a hard time believing that I still have my old job?\"\n\n\nHR: \"Why would you say that?\"\n\n\nMe: \"I'm no longer in my old cubical, I have no computer, phone, supplies, not even an ink pen, my chair is the chair we tried throwing away and if it were possible for us to have chucked it into a trash bin we wouldn't have it.  What I do is a three person job, there are three people doing my job and no plans to move any of them, so honestly, do I  have my old job?\"\n\n\nHR: \"What did you come back?  I'm not sure you might be healthy enough to return to work yet?\"\n\n\nMe: \"I'm back because I got the call last week saying to return or be fired.  It seems you weren't expecting me back.\"\n\n\nDirector: \"Janitor, you do have your job.\"\n\n\nHR: \"Why are you making such a big deal over a chair?\"\n\n\nMe: \"I'm here for 8 hours a day, 8 of those I will spend in that chair.  Eight and a half if I decide to eat lunch at my desk.  Why is it unreasonable to want a comfortable chair?\"\n\n\nHR: \"There is no budget for any more chairs for your department.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Here in HR you have more cubicals, computers and chairs than you have people.\"\n\n\nHR: \"We are expanding.\"\n\n\nMe: \"So at least temporarily you have a computer and chair to loan my department.\"\n\n\nHR: \"That's not how things work.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Do you know how asinine it is that I can't even get a chair?\"\n\n\nHR: \"You have a chair.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Have you seen this chair?\"\n\n\nHR: \"I still don't understand your anger right now?\"\n\n\nMe: \"If I took this to the work force commission and expressed my concern to them that I feared I was replaced while I was on medical leave.  Explained to them that there is a new permanent employee who was hired on while I was on medical leave to sit in my cubical to do my job and I'm in a storage cubical with no supplies and a trashed chair, do you think they'd see it my way that I was replaced?\"\n\n\nHR to Director: \"Janitor doesn't have a computer at all?\"\n\n\nDirector: \"That's correct.\"\n\n\nHR: \"Janitor, we are happy that you are back.  We were shocked at what happened and happy that you survived and was able to return.  I'm concerned for you.  Take the rest of today off, with pay, and you can remain at home with pay, until you have the needed supplies.  I just don't know how long it will take.\"  He then handed me information about a thing about seeing a shrink.\n\n\nI return upstairs to my cubical to grab my stuff and find a new chair and that trash chair missing.  I grab my belongings and one of my VPs show up at my cubical.  \n\n\nVP: \"Janitor, welcome back.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Thank you.\"\n\n\nVP: \"I heard about what happened.\"\n\n\nMe: \"I am able to do my job.\"\n\n\nVP: \"I know, I was actually talking about you and your chair and cubical.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Yeah, that's why I'm going home until I have a computer.\"\n\n\nVP: \"You're right, that chair wasn't fit for anyone to use and I'm sorry you had to go through that.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Thank you, you have no idea how happy I am to hear that SOMEONE agrees with me.\"\n\n\nVP: \"That's why I went down to HR and stole one of their chairs for you.\"\n\n\nMe, shocked: \"Thank you.  But they said...\"\n\n\nVP: \"Don't worry about that, this is your chair now.  You can't steal chairs, but I can.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Thank you.\"\n\n\nI wasn't there much longer.  It still felt like I was punished for my short term disability.  ",

        "text": "My current position is a customer service/reception/accounting/administrative/shipping/whatever my bosses want to stack on me position.  I don't mind having many hats I actually welcome the opportunity to gain experience in multiple areas and I have always sought jobs that could promise that I would stay busy because I absolutely hate downtime at work.  I work at a photo processing lab that deals directly with professional photographers and has been in business for 30-40 years now.  I've worked here for about 2 years now and it has deteriorated very quickly.  When I was hired, my coworker told me immediately \"this place is horrible to work at.  If you can find a different job....find one.\"  I didn't heed her advice because at the time I was making a 1.5 hour drive to work every morning and afternoon and was making less than this place was offering me.  I thought I could deal with a little bullshit.\n\nI learned the software and the products to the same if not higher level than my aforementioned coworker within about 2 weeks.  I had no training at all.  I was given a sheet of paper that told how to run credit cards and a catalog to study.  Every single day I was expected to dress to work in a front desk from 8 to 5 and then go to shipping to help them from 5 to about 8 pm.  A little bit of training back there mostly because ~300 of our customers had special instructions for shipping and I was shown the list of those special instructions.  The money was nice especially since it was now a 15 minute commute instead.\n\nAt first it was just little things.  Having actual disciplinary meetings over things I didn't know was incorrect....most of those disciplinary actions were doled out to my by my coworker...not my manager.  Angry customers.  I was falsely under the impression that dealing with photographers instead of directly to the public would mean there were less angry people.  All of these people would call in because the pictures we sent them were wrong or were damaged....or we printed a photo on a mug upside down and shipped it to them like that.  \n\nThese things SHOULDN'T have been issues because we have a devoted quality assurance team.  I was told...\"we do a large volume...mistakes are bound to happen.\"  That rubbed me the wrong way because there was never any action taken to make the accuracy higher at all.  There was a digital log that was there for each person along the way to sign off on that they had completed a task (presumably for tracking and for accountability) but nobody used it...or if they did they used it sporadically.  We are talking about an 80% accuracy rating by my estimation (based on phone calls and emails versus actual volume) and I just don't feel like that is acceptable at all.  \n\nSo our accuracy is down...we must be very fast right?  Wrong....we quote a 3 day turnaround for most jobs and some of them we'll get out in 2 days and some won't get out for a week and a half.  A week and a half with no documentation on where the job is located within the company except for a printed stack of papers that travel through the building with the job.  Certainly nothing I can see when a customer calls to ask for their order status.  \n\nDuring downtime of our slower season I created a training manual for the front office.  It had a training schedule, text and graphic based training on each of our 5 software systems (3 customer order based, 1 order entry based and 1 accounting), training on every single duty that I had been expected to perform at one point or another and it had a reference section for common questions.  \n\nMy coworker left shortly after that and my boss had me advertise on craigslist.  I did and we didn't get many good applicants so I posted over to my city's job board on Reddit and I found my current coworker there.  She was very optimistic and said that I was just being negative and it wasn't so bad.  We both get in trouble multiple times for answering questions for prospective customers when neither the owner nor our manager would pick up the phone.  She starts realizing how little we matter to anybody else in the company.\n\nBusiness started stalling really bad at this point; the owner and the self-appointed operations manager were going to be gone for a week at a photo expo.  I sent the operations manager an email giving him a breakdown of accuracy and accountability problems.  I gave him details, possible solutions (none of them would have been an additional cost) and told him that I would gladly do anything I could to help out because I see the issue as being more in line with us losing good customers with shoddy work rather then us needing to attract more and more customers.  I told what I saw as problems in the company from my point of view and he agreed with me and said he was making a plan to talk to the owner about making some changes and I had a lot of great ideas that he would bring up as well.\n\nHe gets back and my manager hands my coworker and me a stack of papers with names and phone numbers and tells us to make cold calls.  This rubbed me the wrong way because....we weren't told what to say to these people AND....we'd been in trouble for answering questions CORRECTLY for prospects that called US.  My coworker accepts the stack and makes phone calls and does a great job.  She gets a 40% rate of return on people.  She has to fill out by hand...a form with their address and sample requests.  I create a PDF form that she can just tab through and type in.  I make it set up exactly like the sheets we had been using for years.  My manager hates them....prefers the handwritten.  The owner (who gathers the sample packets and catalogs himself) doesn't have a problem so for sake of ease and to keep legibility we keep using the form. It becomes obvious very quickly that we can't both be making calls because then there's nobody to answer phones and we get in trouble for not getting the phone.  SO we agree that since she does so well at it she will continue making the calls and I will see if I can find more information on the names that don't have phone numbers or email them if I can't.  This allows me to also answer the phones and direct the calls while still contributing.  \n\nManager bitches....I do not use that term lightly....he does not come to me to tell me his issues with this he complains to other people that I'm not doing enough work.  Coworker gets wind of it and tells him exactly what I'm doing and tells him that we are trying to make sure the phones are covered.  \n\nI notice that this list of names and phone numbers has a lot of duplicates and it isn't in any sort of order so I start typing it into a spreadsheet along with addresses that we have gotten for people that requested a catalog.  THEN I find out that the operations manager sent this list IN a spreadsheet format to my manager to begin with.  My manager chose to delete the column that already had address information in it and print it out 3 times (43 sheets of paper each).  I ask the operations manager to send that spreadsheet to us and I go ahead and get rid of duplicates, combine married couples and partnerships, and create a graphical interface that shows which customers wanted catalogs, which were emailed, which we left messages on....so on and so forth.  Suddenly this whole thing becomes so much easier.\n\nMy coworker is now getting in trouble daily.  Too many calls made and the owner can't keep up...too few made.  Too much this too much that.  It becomes too much and she confides in me that she's close to quitting.  I tell her I understand and I'm planning on doing it myself when my boyfriend gets into grad school and we move.  We fantasize together outside of work how awesome it would be to just quit together with no notice.  It gets even worse and she comes in a morning early this week and tells the operations manager she's planning on quitting at the end of the week.  He asks why and she tells him EVERYTHING.  Everything I've told you and more.  I've purposefully avoided talking about the abject sexism in this company because it's so hard to prove something like that....but I promise you it is there.  He is surprised by all of this.  He says he knew our manager was lazy but he didn't realize how bad it was for us.  He tells her that he's not going to say anything to anybody but he suggest she not quit unless she has something lined up and in the time being we should consider reporting issues to beyond our direct supervisor. \n\nCont'd in comments. \n",

Pinky swear.\n\nI recently served on a hiring committee at my job to hire two new employees for our department. One new hire would be working with a Native woman that does admin stuff with one of our sub-departments, and one would be working for us at the front desk.\n\nWe had 3 leading applicants, one of whom scored quite lower than the other two. This one happens to be a Native girl. At our University there is a stroooooong unspoken correlation between favoritism and Native students. Also sports players.\n\nInterviews are over and what a surprise our Native admin lady just adores our lowest scoring candidate, who mumbled throughout her entire interview and could not provide a single example of a workplace conflict that she had resolved in the past. Other committee members, including me, sort of nod and smile and say, \"If you think she'd be a good fit for you, then by all means...\"\n\nFinal scoring comes back. 121, 117, and lowest applicant at 103. There is still talk from my supervisor about our Native admin lady taking on the lowest applicant. I (foolishly) asked how this could be possible, and why HR would approve it.\n\nBoss replies, \"Oh, I can word it in such a way that she'll get preference over the second in line.\"\n\nI come to find, later, that because the lowest applicant is Native, and can therefore speak a language that is *sometimes* used in our Native admin's office, HR should have no problem choosing her over a much more highly-qualified candidate.\n\nToo bad the second applicant wasn't a hockey-player.",

        "text": "In 2007 I worked as a recruiter at a major US Trucking company.  These are the tales from that job.\n\nIt was a mild mannered Thursday morning.  Thinking about the upcoming reprieve, making plans, etc etc.  Nothing too out of the ordinary.  Then they spring a surprise fire drill on us.\n\nNow most everyone likely has a fire escape plan at their workplace posted on some bulletin board that no one ever looks at or thinks about.  When the fire alarm started, I knew to GTFO.  I kindly hung up on the driver I was calling and filed out of the floor and down the stairs.  The rest of the floor, save for about 5 people, stayed at their computers while the loud buzzing of the fire alarm was going off.  Went down the stairs and into the parking lot, as directed.  By the time I got to the parking lot, the rest of the buildings had emptied out and people were in the lot as well, watching for fire trucks, playing on their phones, etc.  It wasn't until about 4-5 minutes later that the rest of the recruiting department came out.  \n\nLater, as we were working away in the afternoon, a message came to all of our inboxes concerning the absolute failure of a drill.  Our security department likes to dig it in when we fail something like parking in 2 spots or a car parking in the motorcycle spaces, or some other dumb thing has happened.  They took from the cameras in the building various pictures of people standing around, people having a smoke out back, someone was texting on their phone in the stairwell, and then the coup de grace....3/4 of the recruiting floor sitting in their desks.  With timestamps....on 5 frames of camera shot......for 4 minutes......\n\nThe managers and directors of the recruiting floor were called into a meeting with Security, our vice president, and our Executive vice president.  We then proceeded to stop everything for 30 minutes so they could hand out flyers with the buildings fire plan on it and everyone could have a look at it.  Every post in the floor had a sign taped to it for Fire and Tornado emergencies.  \n\nTL;DR If there was a real fire, I'd be one of the few left.\n",

        "text": "Sorry for the delay. I said I'd post this on Saturday, but I really started losing it around the time these last few stories happen. Looking back on it all, I probably overreacted to some of it in a way that reflects poorly on me, so it's unflattering, and I'm not sure why I cared about that, but I did. Fuck it. Judge me. I'd rather have the story finished.\n\n---\nOne day, a man who rarely worked in the office came to the office to put together a proposal of some sort. And he couldn't work a printer to save his life. He had been bent over both of our very expensive printers all day long, opening them, trying to load them, poking at their controls and swearing. As I was leaving that day, I asked what he was trying to do. He took offense and started taking his frustration out on me. Yelling. Advancing slowly in a manner meant to intimidate and invade my personal space.\n\nAnd while it obviously wasn't appropriate behavior for the workplace, I saw something far worse in him. Body postures, mannerism, facial expressions, a special and very particular type of anger that I had only seen in one other person in my life. That person this man reminded me of had committed a violent crime against me. I was incredibly shaken up. I went to my boss, thinking she would understand. And to her credit, I think she did understand. I told her that I didn't want to be in close quarters with him ever again. Not even in the same room. She said I could come to her office if I ever felt threatened, but there was otherwise nothing she could do. He went to one of the managers, who went to my boss. She defended me. I didn't end up in HR's office for this one.\n\nI knew she was right about not being able to do anything, because nothing had happened other than an inappropriately angry exchange of words to which there had been no witnesses for an HR \"investigation,\" but I lost faith. I knew without evidence what this person was capable of, and I could do nothing unless he expressed it. I couldn't just go and say I was scared. I knew that would just make *me* look like I was overreacting. But I knew. Helpless. Alone. Flashbacks. I could barely make myself go to work the next morning. I was an hour late. My boss said nothing. I wrote it off as time in lieu.\n\n---\nUnfortunately, they had hired another man who came from a culture that didn't particularly respect women. The biggest way this showed through was that if he passed a woman in our narrow hallways, she would have to move or they would collide. He would never move out of the way for a woman. I was not the only person to notice this. \n\nAnd it was petty of me, but I've always been the type to give the amount of respect I'm given. If you turn your body a little for me, I will turn mine, and we will move past each other. If you don't, I will slam my shoulder into yours. I know it was petty, but by this time I was a burned out husk full of fake smiles and false interest in everyone's home renovations and barbecues and children. Just what they wanted me to be. The only real thing left in me was this sense of respect-me-or-I-will-not-respect-you.\n\nSo one day he tried to pull this on me with a door that I opened and he moved into quickly. I continued going through it even though he was already there. He paused and let me rub my whole body against him as I passed, chuckled, and moved on. The next time I walked past his office, I remembered HR's advice that I should confront the person instead of going straight to HR, and I did so. I said what he had done by blocking the door and forcing me to rub my body against his like that made me uncomfortable, that it could be construed as sexual harassment, and if it happened again I would be going to HR.\n\nI was in HR's office within 5 minutes. He claimed I was rude to him. That I hated him. The he didn't know what he had done to me. I recounted my side of events. HR made their petty decree to solve the problem: From now on, *both* of us were to stand aside anytime someone else wanted to move past us. Then HR turned to me to confirm our stories. So Yvenoile, if the man's version of events was accurate, the collision was an accident. If your version of events was accurate, YOU could have prevented the collision by letting him go through first. Isn't that right? My mind reeled. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The best case scenario was the lie, where there was no fault. The worst case scenario was the truth, and the truth had been dubbed my fault.\n\nI broke. Rage. Angry tears. I said blocking a doorway in that way was textbook sexual harassment. That sexual harassment didn't have to be about attraction, that it could also be about thinking the other gender was inferior. That blaming me for wanting to go through a door was akin to blaming a rape victim for wearing a short skirt. I turned to my boss, who had been brought in as a silent third party incase anything serious went down. I said I was going to start looking for another job, keeping the promise I made months ago. I was sent home early. On my way out I asked to work from home for the next week. I got two days. Whatever.\n\n---\nIn the following weeks, things have been mostly quiet. I quietly asked my few allies who knew the amazing things I was capable of if I could use them as references. They confessed in confidence that they were looking for new jobs as well. I finished my work with the cold efficiency of someone who doesn't want to leave loose ends for her successor to tie up. I am completely caught up and spend half my day reading books. I was 90% certain I wanted to leave, but my comfort zone made me delay. I was now in a place where I could do the work of two people and still have hours of free time I didn't have to confess to. I hadn't made any calls or other move to find another job, though, until two final incidents.\n\nFirst: Late in the week before last, one of the employees who remembered me from the call-in center came in to do a health and safety inspection of the office. She only knew my voice and name, not my face. When I introduced myself and said I used to work in the call center, her response was a straight-faced \"oh, so you're the bitch.\" Bearing in mind I hadn't spoken with her in the better part of a year. Fury. I went to my boss. \"What do you want me to do about it? Go to HR.\" Right. Like I'd go to HR after their fantastic fuckups with Bully Admin and my-culture-doesn't-respect-women man. And why is it anyone else is perfectly fine bypassing HR and coming to you with any problems so you can address them with us directly, but when we need help, you won't do the same? I came back and ranted to Simple Admin about how miss HSE was welcome to have any opinion of me she liked, but I wouldn't tolerate that sort of disrespect and language directed at me. Simple Admin said I was right but tried to brush it off as miss HSE thinking she was being funny.\n\nSecond: Simple Admin, who I haven't spoken about very often, is really chatty. Even when no one's listening, she'll just talk to the computer or talk to herself or talk to the people she thinks are listening. On and on. She also has a temper. These two things combined spawns loud, endless rants polluting our shared office space. Early last week, she got frustrated because her computer couldn't read her mind, and she started slamming things around on her desk. Slam down the phone. Slap down her notebook. I HATE THIS PROGRAM! Open drawer. Slam drawer shut. THEY NEED TO MOVE US OVER TO SOME OTHER PROGRAM! Throw down her pen. Forcefully shove her keyboard away. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD IT IS. I let her go on for about a full minute, completely unable to concentrate the whole time, then turned and asked her to please quiet down a little, it's very disruptive and distracting, but if she wanted to vent in a while I could do so after this task? She stood up, huffed as she put on her jacket, and walked away to go smoke a cigarette, and in the loudest stage whisper imaginable said \"BITCH.\"\n\nOkay. So you knew, from my rant the week before, that I'm not okay with that. And you pretend to be my friend, or something like it. But now you use the same word that, three days earlier, provoked such ire.\n\nI finally, finally gave up and started making calls the next day.\n\nIf anyone has a payroll/admin job available in Calgary... let me know.",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying the company in question folded and I've moved on.  This story will probably tell some of why.\n\nThe company I used to work for had the central \"headquarter\" location, and four satellite offices scattered across the United States.  I was in charge of the most distant office to headquarters, overseeing the operations of a staff of about forty salespeople and a dozen other employees.\n\nOur actual office supplies, paper, toner, etc all came from a delivery service, overseen by headquarters.  But, a memo I got from headquarters, we were now going to put constraints on other purchases.  Henceforth, everything had to be bought through Store X.\n\nWe were assured Store X had the best selection of anything we'd need, they had excellent ethics and worldview.  Which may all be true.  Rainbows could shoot out of the behinds of Store X employees.  I wouldn't know.  The closest Store X to where I lived was over 100 miles away, and I had never been to one.\n\nI sent an email to headquarters, pointing out that this wasn't going to work, and received back a message chastising me for not being behind their decisions.  They stressed the importance of this long term business relationship they were entering into with Store X.  This relationship, I was told, would be valuable to both businesses.  It was important I was behind this decision 100% regardless of the cost.\n\nSo from that day on, once a month, instead of just sending someone around the block for toilet paper, I instead would give someone a full day to drive out to the store and back for cleaner, soap, etc.\n\nThis goes on for close to two years, until they bring in an accountant to review our figures and find places to save some money.  I ran a fairly tight ship, so one of the biggest issues he found for my office was that I was spending out $200 per month to send someone out to pick up $80 worth of supplies.\n\nEveryone over my head was shocked by this, and it caused more discussion than any corporate spending issue.  I thankfully saved the emails where they insisted I do things this way.  \n\nWorst was one woman involved in the email exchange who lived thousands of miles away from me didn't believe that this was the closest store, as she drove by two of the chain stores on the way to work.  I linked her to Store X's store list.  She apparently didn't believe THAT and called their corporate to verify that there wasn't a hidden storefront closer to me.\n\nThe hand wringing finally ended when they decided that I could buy from a different store IF I wrote a letter of apology to Store X's corporate.  Not 100% sure of our business relationship, I wrote a letter stressing how this will not impact our overall mutual respect and hoped they would expand their footprint to our area.\n\nI got a very nice letter back from some secretary, which among other things basically asked who we were.  Apparently the business relationship was more like an unrequited crush on my company's part.  As far as they were concerned, we had no established business with them!",

        "text": "I can't really break this part down into neat little stories, because it just describes a general slow, quiet degredation of my state of mind over three months rather than a series of incidents.\n\nFive months ago, Follower Admin quit. Our boss said that head office decreed we would not be hiring a replacement. Follower Admin had been struggling with what was reasonably two people's workload. She devoted most of her time to one half of her work, and the other half slipped. So my boss divvied up Follower Admin's workload among myself and Simple Admin. I got the difficult half that Follower Admin felt the need to devote all of her time to. I took it as a compliment. She knew I was the only one who could handle it.\n\nBut I made noise. If I'm going to be doing half of her work, do I get half of her pay as a raise? Well no, if they were going to approve raises, they would've just hired a replacement. But later she told both of us she had gotten a $2/hr raise approved. It's something. Looking back on it now, I'm pretty sure I was played from the start. Telling us we get nothing and then telling us we get $2 was like a good cop/bad cop act she did all on her own. Either way, I still wished I had the savings built up to quit on the spot for the unfairness. I told my boss as much. She nodded gravely and said she had been afraid of that. I naively thought of her as a friend, so I sighed and said I would do my best, and I would give her the courtesy of letting her know if I was going to start looking for a new job. She thanked me for both statements.\n\nBut I absolutely rocked that extra workload, and over the course of the next quarter, I revised a few processes and used my knowledge of VBA to improve speed, remove human error, and drastically improve every statistic we could track. Payroll and billing accuracy, which was already fairly high, improved by 10% to near perfect. Billing turnaround time improved by an incredible 85%. Payroll investigation turnaround time improved by 75%. And the time we needed to devote to maintain the account dropped by 65%. I was now too valuable to promote.\n\nMeanwhile, Simple Admin fumbled her extra half of the workload magnificently, and she got it passed on to someone else. But she kept her raise. I now had more work than any of the other admins, while tied with Simple Admin for the honor of making the least money. I'm payroll, remember? I know what everyone makes.\n\nOne positive thing that came out of all this is that my boss stopped bothering me about what time I came in, knowing that while I was very slowly working my way to those amazing statistics, I was working myself to death. Literally. With all this work to do while I was learning to rock this new account that got pushed on me, I was stressing myself out to the point of no longer taking care of myself. I stopped wearing makeup, stopped wearing skirts and dresses and jewelery, stopped working out, stopped dieting. Started killing myself on caffeine and sugar to keep going. Gaining weight. Earning time in lieu hand over fist, but with no opportunity to actually use any of it.\n\nI became hyper-sensitive to noise, which was a problem, because our three remaining admins all shared an office together. And they moved the guy who maintains the uniform room into the empty desk left behind by Follower Admin. Bully Admin constantly kept the radio on even though Simple Admin and I hated it. Add to that a phone call or two, a few employees gathered around the uniform guy's desk, someone trying to scan something on our fancy scan/email/copy center constantly making the console go beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep as they typed... and I just wanted to go into the fetal position under my desk and cry until it all stopped. I never reacted outwardly, even though I wanted to yell at them to stop. Once or twice I started to cry. No one noticed, or if they noticed they pretended not to.\n\nAnd the volume of work. Five payroll runs in a row I ended up in tears. I need help, I would say. I have too much work to do, I would tell my boss. When is relief coming, I would ask HER boss. Early 2014, he would tell me. My boss would half-smile incredulously and tell me that it had been a lie, that help was not coming. I knew she was right. It was late in the year. If they intended to start someone in January, they would already be interviewing people. My boss offered to help with my workload \"when she could\" which would amount to maybe taking two hours of work off my plate per week IF she could find the time for it. Which she really tried to do at first, but it didn't last long when she realized what took two hours for me took two days for her between all her other duties. I was alone and bitter. I started lashing out at my online friends, who had been my only comfort, because it was the only place I could let go, and that was the only thing I had left to let go with.\n\nI came down the the flu and worked from home for three days. It was the best thing ever. It was quiet. I was so much more productive. I did the unthinkable: I caught up with everything I could possibly do without being located physically in the office. I realized I needed to work from home more often, or I needed my own office. It was the only way I could get it all done. I started mentioning these things. That we needed offices. She laughed with pity. They wanted to give you desks half this size and put twice as many people in here, she said. Maybe when our lease runs out next year, they can choose a bigger office building. Our next building is going to have more shared workspaces, not more private offices, she said. What about cubicles at least? Too expensive, she said. I started bringing headphones. A hot defensive anger built up inside me every time I put them on, daring someone to tell me I couldn't have them. It hasn't happened yet.\n\nBut it was funny. While admin was under some mysterious hiring freeze, the reasoning for which had never been explained to us, HR was getting plenty of new people. Some new rules about reference checks while hiring, or some old rules that we weren't following before. So these pretty little part-time students worked for us. And they rearranged the offices so they could conduct their reference checks in complete privacy. And they got paid almost as much as I did. To make phone calls to references all day long.\n\nBut I felt valued. Somehow. Even the regional VP personally came by and shook my hand before going on holidays, saying I might not know it, but I had made a huge impact on the company. He had heard numerous people say \"Yvenoile can help you\" and mean it, knowing that I was always the best person for the job no matter what job it was. They could throw literally anything at me and I was capable of owning it. I came up with solutions. I never said \"this thing is going wrong because that person failed.\" I always said \"let me look at things from their point of view, figure out what happened, and find a way to make it not happen again\" instead. I never said \"We can't do that.\" I always said \"I think I can make that work, but I'll need some time.\" And I was always right.\n\nI meant to finish this series today, but it was too long, so I'll post part 4 tomorrow.",

        "text": "I got promoted out of the call center and into admin after about five months in the call center. One of my coworkers had wanted the position, but she was no good at her job, could barely speak English some days let alone write it, and never made an effort to improve or learn from her mistakes. I had already gotten the position, but it had not yet been announced when one morning she spent hours on the company phone, making personal calls, not taking the calls we were supposed to take, *in a call center*. Leaving me alone to run the entire operation. Literally half the *country's* operations relying on me alone.\n\nWhen I went on one of my carefully-scheduled breaks, I went to the call center manager and expressed my concerns. He pulled her in and spoke to her about how unacceptable it was, and shortly after, he announced my promotion. She hatefully called me a \"lobster,\" willing to drag anyone down to try to climb for myself, like live lobsters trying to escape the pot. I later found out that she spent weeks literally crying to anyone who would listen about how much of a mistake it was to promote me, about how bad I was at my job, about how much I'd mess everything up, about how much more deserving she was of the position. And every time she saw me in the hall, she would try to say hi with this sheepish little smile, as if she thought none of it got back to me.\n\n---\nEnter the admin team. A new position, much better suited to my talents. Numbers. Spreadsheets. Accuracy. Payroll. Billing. Compliance with labor laws. It was a strange arrangement, though. I was some kind of screwed up hourly/salary hybrid, with none of the benefits of either. If I needed to work extra time, I didn't get overtime pay, I got time in lieu. But I didn't get my two weeks of vacation that salaried people get, instead I had this gradually accumulating bank of 4% of my YTD earnings. My boss literally didn't understand why I couldn't take two weeks of vacation time. I said I didn't have it saved up. She said \"but we're treating you like salary. You have to take two weeks.\" I walked away and took one week because that was all I had in the bank. And seriously the worst benefits. The most basic dental and para-medical coverage. That's it. No retirement plan, no savings bonds, no free gym membership that all the real salaried employees got.\n\nThe person who was quitting was training me on how to do her job, and I caught on painfully quickly. Painfully like... I would see within ten seconds that she was about to pay someone the wrong about of overtime, and it would take her 15 minutes of scribbling numbers on a notepad to figure out I was right. But she was good to talk to. She liked the same games I did. We bonded. And she warned me. The Bully Admin and the receptionist already hate you. They hate everyone from the call center, but they really hate you for getting out of it. The Follower Admin goes along with it, but I asked her to look out for you. They hate the Simple Admin too, so don't make friends with the Simple Admin or it will just be harder for you. Politics. Great.\n\nThe Exiting Admin also told me that she and my new boss were really close, and she had always been the boss's informant since the boss's office was far enough away that she never really knew the nuances of what was happening in our world. She kept up with what we were doing, but it was Exiting Admin who had informed the boss on everyone's opinions after she left the room and everyone started voicing opinions they wold never have said if they knew the boss was hearing. She told the boss I was totally fine with taking over in that role, which I was. During my training I could see some of the things she would say, and it was all things that could only help the team. But I found whenever I tried to give her information about this person being upset about this thing or that issue being way more divisive than any of them let on, she would shrug and say she couldn't do anything unless she was there to see it for herself. I stopped informing rather quickly. It was obvious we weren't going to be close.\n\n---\nOne day, sure enough, Bully Admin asked a question to the entire room, not directed at anyone in particular. I answered.\n\nFirst, I should explain: I have unnaturally good hearing because of a former job picking voices out of weak, staticky radio traffic.\n\nSo after I answered, she leaned over to Follower Admin and whispered \"I can't stand her.\" And I heard. Across the room, I heard. I decided to give HR a chance. After all, they clearly had time for this stuff. I reported her. They \"investigated.\" Bully Admin lied and said she didn't say anything. Follower Admin lied and said she hadn't heard one way or another. Thanks for looking out for me. HR called me and Bully Admin into the office, said the investigation was inconclusive and no action would be taken, then looked directly at me and said if there was a problem, I need to try talking to the person first before involving HR. Right. Excuse me Bully Admin, but I couldn't help but notice you said you couldn't stand me, and I don't think that's very professional, so please don't do it again. That's really going to get somewhere.\n\nThe receptionist and Bully Admin were always chatting and laughing until I came in the room, then they always went silent. Awkwardly. Until one or the other giggled and said they'd see the other at lunch.\n\n---\nI had adopted my predecessor's schedule. She came in early so she could leave early, 7:00-3:30. She also used to come in on the Sunday before payroll was due, so she had enough time to get everything done without the stress of the looming deadline the next day, and she would take the following Friday off in lieu. My new boss immediately nixed the Sundays until I was used to the job well enough that I didn't need to ask questions. I understood that well enough. When I felt better about them and asked if I could go back to the old schedule, she nixed the Sundays forever.\n\nShe also pulled me into her office some time later and said I needed to shift my hours so I don't leave so early. I need to stay until at least 4 in case she has questions or something last-minute that I need to do. I raised an eyebrow, thinking anything that was that urgent was going to take more than half an hour. I told her the branch I support is an hour ahead of us, and they open at 8, which is 7 our time. But she said it was the regional office I was physically located in that I needed to be concerned about, not the outlying branch I devoted literally all of my time to. I shrugged. Fine. How stupid. Her mind was obviously made up, so what was the point. My understanding was that I needed to be in the office from 8-4, which were our official office hours. And since there was a half hour unpaid lunch, there was a half hour wiggle room. 7:30-4:00. 7:45-4:15. 8:00-4:30. Whatever. As long as 8-4 was in there.\n\nA few weeks later, my boss called me in asking why I was consistently late. \"Late\" meaning about 7:45. I wanted to tell her it was because I was beginning to hate this place. Because I couldn't will myself out of bed anymore. I had trained myself to be bright and early and you shut me down. But I told her I thought I just had to be here from 8-4. No, she said, we agreed that your hours were from 7:30-4:00. Okay. Whatever. Can I just go now. I began to think of her as a micromanager.\n\nPart 3 tomorrow!",

        "text": "So I liked my job for a while. Now I don't. I found myself thinking back on how this happened, and I wanted to write it down, because it's really a slow downward spiral full of minor incidents that don't look problematic until you string them all together.\n\nI started out in our call center. It's kind of like a dispatch center. I take calls from fellow employees, not customers, so we're all on the same team. It was new and interesting work, but I mostly took the job because it was work. I didn't hate it.\n\n---\nOne day, I was having a conversation with an employee that I had a good rapport with. I mentioned that one of the other operators had been my brother-in-law. I found out later that he didn't like my brother-in-law very much. A few weeks later, the same employee had forgotten to do something important to his job, and it was my job to make sure he didn't forget again. He snapped back angrily at me. Said I was giving him a hard time for no reason. That I needed to just let him do his job. Okay buddy. Had you done your job, this wouldn't even be a discussion.\n\nI was in HR's office by the end of the week. He had written a long letter full of lies, saying petty things like he wanted to be called by a particular nickname and I refused to use it. I was the only one in that room who even knew he preferred the name, and I used it exclusively. Pull the recordings, I said. I'm sure that won't be necessary, they said. He claimed I had only gotten my job through nepotism. My manager hired me because I was better than the only other person she had interviewed. Which was not surprising. I am smart. I learn faster than anyone she'd ever met. HR nodded. That's fine. We know this is a silly complaint. But you have to write down your version of events anyway. What events? He forgot to do this thing and I told him he had to do that thing. None of the rest of this is relevant. Pull the recordings. You'll see I wasn't out of line. You won't pull the recordings? Why not? I never got an answer to that. Just write down your story, they said. Nothing came of it.\n\n---\nOne day, an employee who had a case of the mads about a schedule one of my coworkers had given him started taking it out on me. I kept my cool, but after the super-smiley \"okay bye now\" at the end of our conversation, I slammed the phone receiver down and slapped my notebook down on my desk a little too hard. And I started griping to my fellow coworkers, who had faced similar situations and reacted in similar ways numerous enough times that I thought it was a safe space.\n\nI was in HR's office by that afternoon. We planned for a very strictly regulated break schedule, and they gave me a headset so I couldn't slam down a receiver. Petty. Meddling. And my coworkers, who I thought I could safely talk to, had been the ones to report me rather than show any signs of concern. Turn to me and say \"are you okay? You don't usually react like this.\" No. My bad day is a disruption to them. Their smiles and how-are-yous couldn't be more false. Our rapport is a facade. I get it now.\n\n---\nOne day I wrote an email in which I tried to use the word \"nag\" in a friendly, joking way. \"I'll work on getting that information, but Ben might know better than I do, so John might actually want to nag Ben for it too.\" I was in HR's office that afternoon. A third party copied on the email, not John, not Ben, I don't know who other than not them, had taken offense. I sat there with my jaw set and stared at the wall, trying not to blurt out \"I quit.\" Petty. So petty. I wasn't even written up for it. I hadn't been written up once yet. They just liked to take me in there and waste my time with lessons about how to function in a world where politeness, not aptitude or results, mattered. All they cared about was the facade. Joking about nagging was genuinely part of my personality, and they wanted me to kill it. Or at least turn it off while I was at work. It's not my fault Mr. Mystery assumed the worst. It's text. He could've come to me, and I could've explained. I guess that's not how we do things.\n\nStay tuned for part 2: The promotion.",

Now Tony would say things that give recruiters the reputation that they have within the trucking industry (that we're all liars of the highest degree), and he claimed that \"all drivers are liars\".  He also carried around an air of \"I am better than you and I will make everyone else know it\".  He drove a BMW.  He bragged about his smoking hot fiancee.  He smelled of Stetson, overdriven to stick in your nostrils for days afterward.\n\nQueued up some outbound calls to a section of SE NY State where we're looking for drivers for a local job for a large office supply company.  We are paying x rate per mile plus stops and hourly for city service (NYC, Boston).  Tony goes into his act (telling him we're looking for drivers, some job info) and asks the pre-requisite questions required (tickets, misdemeanors, felonies) and the driver he's talking to has a drug misdemeanor from 20 years go.  In a situation like this we are directed to go to our area director, outline the situation, and then get a yea/nay on whether to proceed with offering an orientation day and going through background checks, or just disconnecting and going onto the next one.\n\nTony leans in and whispers with a hint of cocky bravado \"We're going to let him slide by, this is how you get good like me\".  He tells this guy outright to \"not mention it to the scheduler or investigator\" and continue on with what the job entails, including mentioning bonuses that weren't part of the account's contracted obligations.  The driver was certainly interested in the opening as it meant he could be home more often (which was truth) and that he was getting paid twice as much (a lie).  He gets transferred through to get set up with an orientation day.  \n\nAbout 2 weeks later, Tony gets his report rollout of the drivers he's gotten to orientation vs how many actually got hired.  Now, if your percentage or overall numbers are low, they'll call you in to speak with the director about it.  He had 1 hire......on 24 orientation attendees.  Our driver was not hired.  Turns out the investigators found out about his drug misdemeanor.....and B&amp;E.....and Assault.......and the reason he didn't commit anything else since then was because 12 of those 20 years he was behind bars.  When the driver was asked to leave our orientation, he sat down and refused, claiming that as a soverign citizen he didn't have to abide by unconstitutional court rulings and that they were invalid...\n\nNeedless to say, Tony got taken down a rung after walking out of that meeting, and I learned a valuable lesson:  Stocking the cupboard is much different than throwing poop at the wall and seeing what sticks.\n\nTL;DR Don't Lie.  It's unbecoming of a professional environment.",

But she is good at dealing with the many varied temperaments of our construction workers, so I keep her around.  Plus she is willing to work for cheap.\n\nYesterday our mailbox got hit by a car.  I went and bought a new one, plus stickers for the street number and address.  My street name is something easily recognized when shorted.  Let's say that instead of \"Corporate Blvd\", it is usually abbreviated to Corp Blvd.  That's not the name, but it is a word that is EASILY recognized when shortened by anyone who is proficient in the English language.\n\nSo I hand the secretary the mailbox and the stickers.  I tell her to put the stickers on the mailbox in the condensed form spelling out \"1234 Corp Blvd\".  I want it to say the whole thing because our offices can be very hard to find.\n\nWell, the stickers were too big for the mailbox, so instead of putting the entire phrase on each side, she puts \"1234\" on one side and \"Corp Blvd\" on the other.  Which, well, good job, but that doesn't exactly help people to find our offices, does it?\n\nBut that's not really enough of a story to make me post here.

This is actually a story I heard from one of these volunteers.\n\nThis volunteer worked as an air traffic controller for a small \"international\" airport. It has one terminal that hosts three airlines, two runways, and flies to six cities. One of the runways has the planes going right over an older couple's house. They lived there about a year before the second runway was extended, but the other runway and the local fighter wing were there long before.\n\nThey start calling the info desk at the airport to complain about planes about 2-3 times a week and when the tower supervisor hears this, he tells the desk attendant to give them his direct line next time they call. Once they get his number they call every time a plane goes over (about 5-10 times a day) to complain. Every time they called they would yell for a few minutes and hang up, which the supervisor took every time for about a week.\n\nHowever, one day he snapped. It was about the third time that day they called and he recognized their number on caller ID. He picks up the phone and they immediately launch into \"Another plane few over, when are you going to stop this, it's ruining our quality of leave, we're old, audubon society, etc.\" They start complaining about the loudness of the planes when he interrupts:\n\n\"You want to hear something loud?!\"\n\nHe takes the phone and slams it around in an empty metal garbage bin next to his desk and hangs up. That incident was about five years old when I heard the story and it's a year later now. In all that time they haven't heard a complaint from them since.\n\nI wish I worked in a job where I could do that and not get in trouble.",

        "text": "I wanted to tell the full story, so split it in two. I feel they're separate stories, but the abrupt way the story resolves after the first part makes me not want to waste your time trying to find the other thread. So without further wasting your time, please enjoy this story which begins on the day I was described as an incompetent idiot.\n\nSo I work in print (hello, /r/TalesFromPrintAndCopy/) and we deal with plenty of the general public. As I'm sure you are aware, quality varies. So this guy writes in and asks for *five* copies of a CD. Real hey, big spender kind of stuff. He supplies the artwork just fine (small mercies) and sends through four audio tracks, which I burn to the five copies, assemble in his custom printed *five* cases and send them out as he'd paid for delivery.\n\nTwo days later, we get an email. Same guy, but now he's mad. The CD only has four tracks on it. You remember, the one's he sent? Well, the email says, the last two tracks are wrong. He sends two more files. I burn the original two tracks, drop the \"wrong\" ones and replace them with the new tracks. Send them out. He'd paid for delivery again because he was at fault.\n\nTwo days later, we get an email. Same guy, but now he's belligerent. Am I an idiot? the email asks before continuing by informing that the tracks weren't \"wrong\" but actually, what he meant by that was the CD was supposed to have six tracks. If he wasn't so brash when complaining both times, we might've let the cost of the discs slide, but for five copies and his increasingly rude attitude only points to us \"having\" to charge him for the effort. We're sorry about the inconvenience. But not really.\n\nSo anyway he refuses to pay and went on to call me specifically (an 3½ year employee) specifically stupid and our entire company incompetent. He didn't pay, his CDs were recycled after about eight weeks on non collection.\n\nThis is where I thought it ended.\n\nBut he calls up a couple months down the line. Gets my boss on the line and asks for five copies of some CD. Like any other customer, really. He says sure and agrees to do the job. When his email comes through (all artwork is sent to a central email, so we all see the same things, its a really small company) and I see it, I'm shocked. I look around and it seems like my boss is handling the job and actually printing the discs. Surprised is the least of what I am. I track down his old emails and go confront my boss.\n\n\"You're not actually doing this guys job, are you?\" I ask and the answer comes back, \"Yeah, why wouldn't I?\" which says to me that he didn't remember the guy. We get a lot of customers, so this isn't surprising. So I show the email. \"Because he didn't pay for his last job, remember? He called us all incompetent and me stupid. Then didn't even apologise when he gets in touch again?\" - I could see that he was conflicted by this as he'd already agreed to do the job, but had a pretty good reason not to. For some unknown reason these words passed his lips: \"Sometimes you just have to be kind.\"\n\nBe kind? Be kind‽ to who? some nobody doing five discs who openly insults your staff, doesn't pay for his job is rude and is only putting through *eighteen dollars* worth of sale? I went to another part of the office and paced around while I let out bursts of muffled curses like a steam engine. Surely, *surely*, I'm worth more than that? You'd sell me out for eighteen dollars - MINUS expenses? I was livid. You could have lit cigarettes off my skin. I didn't know what to say, so I shut the fuck up and avoided him for the rest of the day and most of the next day and the day after that. Eventually I told myself he'd been stuck because he agreed to do the job. That had to be it. It was nothing personal, just forgetful and whatever. The time had passed.\n\nThen a few weeks later, he writes back in again. \"Can I have five copies of this please?\" - My co-worker and I both agreed to ignore the email with extreme prejudice. A week later, he calls asking about the whereabouts of his discs. My co-worker fields the call and puts him on hold. Checks with the boss. \"Should we do this guys job? I mean, to remember him, right?\" - the next thing I hear is about 20 minutes later. We're doing the job.\n\nWow.\n\nJust wow, but I hold my tongue. I'm livid, but I keep my cool. I'm restrained. Obviously, there's nothing I can do. It is what it is and I've just got to learn that sometimes the working man gets treated like this. It's just my turn and I'm glad it's not worse. But still, I feel betrayed. Like, and apologies about the cheap metaphor, but like a knife had been plunged into my chest. How could he? How could he do this guys job? How could he treat me like this? But whatever. Let it slide. Boss apparently changed from the cool, kinda hip boss I started working for into someone who'd rather make eighteen bucks (minus expenses) than to stick up for a three+ year employee. Whatever.\n\nSo anyway, a few days later and I'm calling my boss a Nazi.\n\nOn this day, my co-worker and I (we share adjoining cubicles with low walls between them, so we can talk while doing the bulk of our work) were packing a new type of case. For whatever reason, they didn't have a dedicated spine (like a DVD case has, for example) but just the hinge part where the front and back join. We had to insert slicks into these cases. The slicks had printed spines which were hard to line up. We'd never packed this kind of case before and it was tough. Half a mm in either direction and it looked off. Presentation matters, so we were making sure it was correct. Just chatting to pass the time.\n\nBoss walks past and his words, I feel, will be etched into me for years to come. \"Hey guys, how about less chatting and more packing?\" Stunned once again, I fire back, \"You know we're packing at the same time, right? We can do that.\" he returns, \"Yeah, but you're going so slow.\" and retreats back to his office. Snidely I suggest to my co-worker that the Boss should try \"More sucking on *this* and less telling us how to do our jobs.\"\n\nWe got the job done one day and three hours before it was due for completion.\n\nIn an industry like ours, we have busy periods and quiet periods. The afternoon following that particular job was quiet, which meant two things. One: We had plenty of time to pack that job. And two: I had plenty of time to think about what he'd said earlier.\n\nSo when I'm leaving for the evening, I pop my head in to his office to say good night, as I've always done. In the end I decide to speak up. \"You know, it might be one thing to do a job for a client who openly insults your staff (he seemed puzzled by this, then did what I feel was a mock imitation of remembering *oh yeah, him*) but its another to tell your staff they can't talk to eachother. That's ridiculous.\" He explains his rationale by repeating what he said before, that we were packing too slow (I countered with the facts of the matter: That it was complete well ahead of schedule and \"going so slow really interfered with the rest of the jobs we had to do today, didn't it?\") and that we talk *too much*, so much that it sounds like an old wive's club over where we sit. I asked him if that mattered as long as we did our jobs and that I'd been in the same position with two other employees over the last three and a half years of my employment and was never under the impression that talking wasn't allowed. He seemed not to care and so the last thing I said before walking out was \"People are people and need to talk. You can't stop people from doing it. That's Nazi shit.\"\n\nAnd because I am petty, I spent the entirety of the next day answering any questions via a notepad I'd bought. I wrote everything down and except for walk-ins and telephone calls, I was completely silent.\n\nAnd you know what? I really didn't notice and dramatic improvement in my ability to do my job (specifically speed-wise) when I wasn't using my mouth to do it with.\n\nSo that's my story. The End.",

        "text": "So today, it happened. I got 'let go' from a job that I truly thought was going to open the door to the rest of my life. I feel terrible, but at the same time, I feel so relieved.\n\nTruth is, it wasn't a good fit. I had no connection with my middle-aged office-mates. I wanted to like sitting at Quickbooks all day, sending out invoices for loans. I tried to get something better out of it, but being a non-profit, it wasn't like I could pick up hours or really delve into my own projects and interests. I think the organization is great- if I could've essentially gotten a creative role or anything where I could feel myself learning or being of actual use. There was no chance to move up, and even when I started, I knew I didn't have the patience to stay there long. \n\nThe job kind of fell into my lap after a meeting about volunteering. Even though I had no real experience or interest in clerical work (I've got a background in marketing, social media, and entrepreneurship), I was so enamored by my name being attached to the kind of organization I spent 4 years and $100,000 to be a part of, I didn't think twice.\n\nThe worst thing about it is I don't know what to do next. It was only PT (I still work FT as a server) so the money part isn't a real issue. There's just so few similar organizations around or even other gateway positions that I can get involved with. \n\nI'll take an internship, I'll volunteer. Both would end up being more rewarding, I think. There's slim-pickings where I'm from and I'm not in the position to move anytime soon.\n\nOn the bright side, I haven't had a day off since I started in June. I get to spend a few whole days with myself. I need a haircut, to clean the house, call my parents and catch up on BrBa. No more 70-hour weeks, no more lonely days in a quiet office. \n\nI wish the organization well and thank them for the opportunity- the opportunity to remind me that I'm NOT the silent, sitting-at-desk, getting-headaches-from Quickbooks type. I need to talk to people and make connections and see growth and feel like a useful cog. I'm not a scapegoat, I'm not uneducated, I'm not shy, and I'm not afraid. I'm ready to kick some ass.",

        "text": "I've been a lurker mostly on childfree and cheese subreddit, so when I had this problem, I didn't know where to post until my husband told me about this subreddit which I think is appropriate.\n\nBackground story: Back in March, my boss sent a mass email to a few of us requesting us to submit an abstract for a conference. Since I just completed a project in which I was a PM for, I looked forward to presenting the data from that project. However, within 45 minutes after the original email was sent, a coworker (let's call him A for ASS) who worked on the project with me sent a mass reply that he wanted to present that project. I was slightly annoyed, but whatever, there are other things I can talk about.\n\nFast forward to last week. A's wife is expecting their first born middle of next month (October). He asked me if I can help him with the presentation. The conference is next week. I asked him, how much help did he need? He said, he does not have a first draft yet. WTF? So, not only he stole the presentation from me, now he wants me to write it for him? I asked him, wasn't he the one that wanted this 6 months ago? Then he proceeded to say, well... I didn't know back then that my wife would be having a baby. I looked back into my chat records with him (yay... Gtalk record!) and he announced about the baby back in February, 1 month before the abstract submittal. So he could have just NOT submitted any abstract or even better, hand it off to me 6 bloody months ago! I told him, at least give me his abstract or a first draft so I know what he's planning to talk about. Then I said, I'm only doing this for his wife, not for him. A said, he'll think about it and let me know if he needs my help.\n\nThen, Monday (1 week before the conference), A asked my other coworker (let's call her B) to present the talk (yes, the project that I was a PM for) and write the entire presentation. He told her he's not able to present at the conference because of the baby is coming any time (by the way, same state, but about 1 hour flight, he could easily take a morning flight there, and evening flight back). He asked B to write the presentation and present it as him. B has no idea how to write a presentation on a project that she was never involved in, and she has to do it in less than one week. She came to me with the news and almost begged me to go instead of her. I looked her in the eyes, and told her that I would only do it for her, but I am PISSED as fuck with A. Who the fuck does shit like that? Then, she saw how pissed I was, and told me, no, it's okay, she'll do it. She's a trooper like that.\n\nSo... let's recap...\n1. He, who has a PhD in engineering, happens to forget that pregnancy takes 9 months, meaning that your baby WILL come in October\n2. He said he was not expecting his wife to be pregnant in October. Is he telling me that the baby was NOT planned? So, his first born son was an accident?\n3. Does expecting a baby also prevent him from writing the presentation on top of the not going to the conference? Or was he planning on making other people writing it all along?\n\nNow, I'm having problem with my conscience because I don't want this to ruin my relationship with B (practically the nicest person in the company), even though I had nothing to do with causing her the problem. I have a public speaking difficulties that when I'm presenting at a conference, I would have to finish the presentation weeks before, and practice the talk over and over again before the day of. Had I known I'd be presenting this project 6 months ago, I would have started at least 1 month before the presentation. On top of that, we're super crazy busy at work that the only time I'll have time to work on the presentation would be at home on my own time. I really do NOT want to go at all. I may have to for her. \n\nTLDR: 6 months ago, asshole coworker claimed my project as his own to present at a conference happening next week, and now asked another coworker to write and present for him 1 week before the conference",
