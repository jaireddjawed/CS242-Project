It also says, \"and of course f3 = O(f2), this time with c = 1.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. What is the significance of the less than or equal to 20? Why are we dividing the two functions in the first place?\n2. If f3 = O(f2) with c = 1, does that mean f2 = O(f3) with c = 2 because of the 2n?\n\n2a. What exactly is c determined by? Can c be anything?",

I started my computing science degree about 3 years ago, and the first 2 years were actually a lot of fun, for the most part i enjoyed most of my classes(except discrete math lol). But lately I've just had zero motivation to continue my degree and do well in my classes anymore. I was really into web development, and have made a couple projects over the years but now i just cant bring myself to write any code or do any projects. \n\n I have 3 semesters left including this current one, and I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone through this and re-ignited their love for computer science and programming.  Any tips or personal experiences are more than welcome. Thanks",

I have some front-end dev projects done including my Portfolio website.\n\nOne of the goals I've set for the year is to land an internship. The problem is, I don't know how I can. Last year I applied for an internship at one of my college's 'Computer Science career weeks' : where IT companies come over, explain what their company is about, let you know about their grad programs, internships e.t.c.

I have experince with Python, linux, Docker and Kubernetes, CICD pipelines, and AWS cloud (I also have a aws associate architect cert) and some rather small experince working with Hadoop and Spark (as administrator). \n\nWhat topic from these would be best to research about? I have seen several articles about kubernetes (generally containers and orchestration of them) and also Cloud computing, but I'm not sure what Academic books are good to do a more deep research about them.\n\nI really would appreciate any sort of help/advice :)",

The goal is to produce a chat-based language model that is much smaller than GPT-3 while maintaining similar performance.\n\nIf you want to support them, they are crowd-sourcing training data [here](https://open-assistant.io/).\n\n**What Does This Mean?**\n\nCurrent language models are too big.\n\nThey require millions of dollars of hardware to train and use. Hence, access to this technology is limited to big organizations. Smaller firms and universities are effectively shut out from the developments.\n\nShrinking and open-sourcing models will facilitate academic research and niche applications.\n\nProjects such as Open Assistant will help to make language models a commodity. Lowering the barrier to entry will increase access and accelerate innovation.\n\nWhat an exciting time to be alive! \n\nThank you for reading!

        "text": " \n\nSo this is a hypothetical question, but just based on monetary factors, how much of a difference does it make if you opt to go for a CS PhD, instead of starting to work right after your bachelor's CS degree?\n\nLet's say the country in question is USA, and you get to work in some FAANG company as a software engineer, or you do a PhD in a good college/university that specializes in CS, and the PhD will take 5 years, which is a typical time.\n\nI want to know how a PhD holds up from a financial point of view, given that you can do TA/RA -ships, intern at companies in summer etc. while doing a PhD. Like how much of a head start would the software engineer route have (considering cost of living, taxes etc.)?\n\nAlso given that after 5 years of PhD, you get into a FAANG company as a researcher (whose roles are typically reserved for people with a PhD), what kind of salary difference are we looking at, given that the job person sticks to the same company.\n\nNow of course in reality there is no point in this comparison. If you are passionate about research and care about pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, then PhD is probably the best option, and hence, this question tries to look at the financial stability point of view.\n\nI'd like a decently average case analysis. Sorry in advance if this is a naive/stupid question. (My career choices will depend somewhat on the feedback I get ;)\n\nPS: I tried posting in the cscareerquestions subreddit, but I apparently do not have enough community karma :(",

The pattern ends up being a snake-like pattern where the axis is traversed in descending order to minimize the number of turns. Though getting this to happen in code eloquently has been a real fucking bitch. So far, I've generated the area with no care in which order they're put in. Then sort so the longest axis is moved through first, then I go through once and create subsets for every time two axis values have been changed and add every one of those elements back to a new list where every other subset is in reverse order. then I do that again but create a subset this time when every axis value has been changed.

        "text": "I read code from the program's perspective, tracking where the program currently is and how it flows. But often when I look at some code, whether it be mine, someone else's, a leet code problem, whatever - I quickly can get myself tangled up. This happens for any other topics that involve theory/underlying concepts/things happening under the hood.\n\nI've come a long way and am having success in my studies/projects, but if I honed my internal processes, it would exponentially help my ability to learn and code with more speed and quality. Maybe there's a book out there that covers this? I do well with rigid structures that I can adhere to.\n\nMy brain can easily get disorganized, and with heavy adhd it's constantly latching onto different things as I read through code. I often have to wrangle it in. Are there any techniques or strategies to combat this to allow more consistent and fluent reading and digestion of code? Maybe like a consistent step-by-step process to discipline my brain?",

I considered switching to an HBO, but its 4 years and I’m already turning 24 this year. The uni is way too demanding to learn coding next to it but they dont teach almost any practical stuff (when they do I enjoy that part) and I already feel burnt out and done with this.

        "text": "Hi everyone, I’m sure you all have seen the news lately so you are all probably aware of the AI race that has begun between our corporate overlords. I think there is a lot of concern surrounding the dangers of this technology but I also believe it has the power to do amazing things for humanity. I often think about how early digital computers were used for things like the manhattan project to develop nuclear weapons but they are also used to fight cancer, develop vaccines, nuclear fusion, provide internet, etc. Anyways, this has me thinking about the divisive nature of the algorithms that power social media and search feeds. We have a huge issue with polarization and echo chambers in this era but I am wondering if ai could be a solution. With the announcement that AI features are coming to Bing and Google I can’t help but think about how this shift in how we collect knowledge on the internet will affect our views and biases (for good or bad). Imagine a future where ai can combat misinformation on Facebook for example. Obviously this is all very hypothetical so please don’t bash me in the comments, I just thought about this and thought I’d share my ideas to see what other people might think. The last thing I want to add is the ethics involved with implementing ai to combat extreme polarization. I think we as humans need to be extremely careful because this technology could be used for  the opposite purpose, I.e. fuelling misinformation with biased models, censorship, worsening the current state of predatory ads/surveillance capitalism, etc. there is so many dangerous applications of AI but there is so many wonderful applications too (like what I mentioned above about the advent of digital computers). Do you guys think this hypothetical use of ai is possible? If so, what ethical considerations and regulations do we need to consider?",

Idk can someone help me from their experience about how they managed time and made sure they stayed up to date with the studying part?

I waste a lot of time in thinking about how to plan the day and then end up rushing things towards the end and forget it the after the lab/ class test. There is no learning happening here i try to focus and sit for long hours but i just end up wasting time thinking about what the future holds, get extremely anxious from time to time. can someone help me make a schedule.
