        "text": "Weeks earlier, \\[Tuesday, January 24, 2022\\] Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested that the special grand jury investigating [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/president-donald-trump-45) and his allies’ efforts to upend the 2020 election in Georgia had recommended multiple indictments and said that her decision on whether to bring charges is “imminent.”\n\nMultiple media outlets at that time wanted the final grand jury report to be released and more recently \\[Feb. 13, 2023\\], Judge Robert C.I. McBurney ordered a partial release; In his eight-page ruling, he said he had to prioritize the public's right to know about at least the general findings of the probe into the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMcBurney, however, noted that any recommendations for criminal charges, which [may include the former president](https://www.newsweek.com/fulton-county-grand-jury-could-necessary-ammo-prosecuting-trump-1776268), will not be made public on Thursday.\n\nInstead, McBurney said that the report's introduction and conclusion, which could give hints about a criminal recommendation, and a section that detailed concerns from the special grand jury that \"some witnesses may have lied under oath during their testimony\"—therefore committing perjury—can be released.\n\n\"Having reviewed the final report, the undersigned concludes that the special purpose grand jury did not exceed the scope of its prescribed mission,\" McBurney wrote. \"Indeed, it provided the District Attorney with exactly what she requested: a roster of who should (or should not) be indicted, and for what, in relation to the conduct (and aftermath) of the 2020 general election in Georgia.\"\n\nNoting this line, in McBurney's ruling, Georgia State University College of Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis then tweeted that [\"the writing is on the wall\"](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-fulton-county-georgia-readies-release-records-grand-jury-1780902) in regard to an indictment for Trump or his allies. Kreis said it may be \"seems unlikely\" that jurors would believe witnesses lied under oath and then not recommend charges be brought forward.\n\nDoes the abbreviated release \\[2/16/23\\] shed any light on potential charges against Trump \\[if any\\], the DA may present to a new jury?\n\n[2022-ex-000024-ex-parte-filing-12.pdf (documentcloud.org)](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23608438/2022-ex-000024-ex-parte-filing-12.pdf) \\[Order from February 13, 2023\\]\n\nPartial release of Grand Jury report from February 16, 2023.\n\n[2022-EX-000024 - EX PARTE ORDER OF THE JUDGE (1) - DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23683224-2022-ex-000024-ex-parte-order-of-the-judge-1)",
