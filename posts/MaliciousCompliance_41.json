        "text": "LTL FTP on mobile etc etc\n\nSo, the other day I was sitting in my ceramics class minding my own business by the glaze table. For those who aren’t familiar with ceramics, glazes are very finicky and almost never do what you want them to do, especially when you mix them with other colors.\n\nSo, I’m sitting by the glaze table and I overhear this conversation take place between my teacher and a student, let’s call them RB.\n\nRB: so, do you have a skin color glaze?\nTeach: what do you mean by skin color? There are many different types of skin color\nRB: like, normal skin color\nTeach: what do you mean by “normal” skin color?\nRB: like, tan\nTeach: oh, so you mean like your skin color.\n\nAt this point, I’m pretty pissed off. My school is pretty white and pretty conservative, so I have to put up with this shit a lot. Now, the teacher goes on to recommend a glaze combo that I have used before. I don’t think he’s used it, so his suggestion is genuinely meant to be helpful. I, however, know this combination can turn out from anywhere between bright red to black. \n\nNormally I’m a pretty helpful student, so I go up to her and start saying “excuse me...” trying to tell her that the combo wouldn’t give her what she was looking for, but she cut me off and said “don’t talk to me.” Don’t talk to you? Alright. \n\nI’ve been anticipating the day the piece comes out of the kiln, and today was the day. It came out even better than I expected. She still got a “normal” skin color, which is I guess what she wanted anyways ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n[Here’s a pic of the final result](https://imgur.com/gallery/t28AXVQ)\n",

        "text": "This happened a while ago when I was working phone tech support for a company that made a business management software package. Customers who bought BusinessSoft got support as part of their monthly license fee for the software. They would call us for help with things like installing it, how to perform this or that task, getting help with error messages, etc.\n\nA new version of BusinessSoft came out, and it had a bug: it wrote some incorrect data to the registry, and until the data was corrected, the program wouldn't even start up. For those of you not familiar, Windows has a big database like thing called the registry that holds lots and lots of configuration information for both Windows and your programs - everything from \"what should I do when you double click on a .mp3 file\" to \"what color font should your emails have\" to \"where is this important file that BusinessSoft needs to start up?\" If you go in there and start screwing around without knowing what you're doing, you could easily break something, but if you do know what you're doing it's pretty safe, quick and easy to change a specific setting.\n\nAnyway, customers began calling in about the error. I would get remotely connected to their computers, edit the registry key, start up BusinessSoft, and sign off. Nice, easy 5 minute resolve. Then one day my boss Nathan was walking by my desk and saw the Registry Editor open.\n\nNow Nathan was one of those guys who'd been working in the same department in the same company for about a decade and had just recently managed the lofty goal of lower tier management - a warning sign if ever there was one. He had never been much more than an average support tech, but listening to him you'd think he wrote the damn thing. Now he'd finally gotten promoted and was ready to Enforce Some Rules. Never mind that other people who been there a fraction of the time could troubleshoot circles around him. *cough* He didn't know how to edit the registry, so it was Bad and Dangerous.\n\n\"Tommy! Are you in the registry?! You can't be in the registry!\"\n\nI groaned inwardly. \"Nathan, it's that new defect. I have to. There's no other way to fix it.\"\n\n\"That's against the rules. We are not supposed to make any changes to Windows settings. We only support BusinessSoft, not Windows.\"\n\n\"Nathan, this isn't a Windows setting, BusinessSoft just stores its data there-\"\n\nHe actually held up a finger to stop me. \"No registry changes. Tell them you'll email them the changes they need to make, and they can pass it along to their IT department.\"\n\nHe strolled back to his desk, sat down and started typing. A few minutes later an email went out to the whole team, reiterating that we are NOT responsible for fixing any issues with Windows, including editing the registry. Then he went back to looking at wrestling memes, satisfied that he'd done himself a manage today.\n\nI was fuming. How rdiculous! A five minute call turned into three days of chasing down users to make sure the problem was solved, callers angry that they couldn't work, customer complaints, bad review survey scores-\n\nOh, this would solve itself, wouldn't it?\n\nMy first chance came that afternoon. A lady called in because they'd just upgraded BusinessSoft and now it wouldn't start.\n\n\"Yes ma'am, I apologise, that is a known issue with the new version. Luckily the fix is very simple. I will email you instructions which you can pass along to your IT department, and follow up with you to make sure the issue is resolved.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't just fix it?\" She sounded worried.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but the fix requires making changes to the Windows registry, which must be done by your IT department.\"\n\nShe was getting frustrated now. \"I don't have on site IT. I have to pay to have someone come out, and it's expensive and takes forever! Do you know how much I pay for BusinessSoft every month? Our main business program is DOWN right now!\"\n\n\"I really am sorry-\" I really was, too \"-but I can't fix it myself. If you'd like, I can give you my supervisor's email address and extension if you would like to speak to him directly.\"\n\nShe did, and I did, and I signed off and relogged the case to my queue to follow up on. The next morning another call came in, and the customer was even angrier; and another that afternoon, followed by an email alert that I'd gotten a bad customer feedback survey. Meanwhile everyone else on the team who usually fixed these problems was giving their own deepest apologies to angry customers, alog with our boss's contact info. \n\nThe next morning when I came in, the director of support - my boss's boss's boss- called me into his office. He asked me about the bug and how to do the fix, and even opened up Regedit on his computer and had me walk him through it. Then he thanked me and sent me back to my desk. A few minutes later I saw Nathan, red-faced, power walking into the director's office. He returned about 10 minutes later, and 10 minutes after that an email came in. \n\n\"BusinessSoft policy states that we are not responsible for making any changes to Windows configuration. However, recently a defect was found in BusinessSoft 20xx in which incorrect data is stored in the Windows Registry. Since this data is written and maintained entirely by the BusinessSoft product, and given the severity of the defect, as a courtesy to our customers we will fix the issue by editing the Windows Registry after permission is granted in writing via E-mail. If a customer calls reporting error such and such, tell the customer that you will log an emergency call and log the call to Tommy Walker.\"\n\nA few minutes later, another email came, this time just to me and Nathan: I was to give the registry edit calls top priority, including above taking live calls.\n\nNathan didn't look me in the eye for a while after that.\n",

        "text": "A few years ago I was on a flight from LA to Singapore (takes 16+ hours).  I'm a tall dude - around 6'3\" (~190cm) - so I don't fit very well in economy class seats.  On most planes my knees are often very close or right up against the seat in front of me.  This makes it impossible for the person in front of me to recline their seat, which usually isn't a problem once the person in front of me sees how cramped I am in those tiny seats.  \n\nHowever for this particular flight, the man in front of me was not having it.  He tried to recline his seat, but couldn't because my legs were there.  He turns around and sees what's happening and asks me something along the lines of, \"Do you mind letting me put my seat back?\"  \n\nI respond with, \"I wish I could but I physically can't.  I'll do my best to give you as much space as I can, but it won't be much.\"  At this point he starts to get angry and just starts pushing as hard as he can back on his seat.  Needless to say, this was not particularly pleasant for me.  I ask him to please stop, and he says, \"I'll stop when I can put my seat back.\"\n\nI decide I'll just wait him out; he'll eventually get tired.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, he calls a flight attendant over and proceeds to demand a new seat.  The flight attendant tells him there are no available seats and he will have to deal with it.  He demands to speak to the pilot.  \n\nSo the flight attendant goes up front to talk to the cockpit.  Keep in mind that throughout this he is still pressing with all his might against my knees, with only short breaks to yell at the flight attendant.  After a couple of minutes, the co-pilot (he wanted to speak to the pilot and wan't happy about this) comes back and tries to explain to the man that he can't change seats because there are no other coach seats free.  The man continues to demand a seat that is able to recline, give me an upgrade, this is unacceptable, making a scene etc.  \n\nThe co-pilot finally gives in and says while looking at the man, \"Sir, would you like to sit up in business class?\"  \n\nThe man stands up and mutters something similar to, \"Fucking finally.\"  To which the co-pilot responds, \"Sir, sit down.  I wasn't talking to you.\"  He turns to me and repeats, \"How would you like a seat in business class?\"\n\nI have, to this day, never seen someone as furious as the man as I walked past him to my new business class seat (with free drinks).",

        "text": "Warning: this story is pretty gross and involves my monthly lady business. \n\n\n\nA few days ago, I was in a public place and needed to deal with my menstrual cup. For those of you who don't know, a cup is a sustainable alternative to other menstrual options. It's basically a flexible silicone cup you place in your nethers, and it catches all of your output. It needs to be emptied and washed periodically throughout the day.\n\n\n\nThere are two empty restrooms, so I duck into one. Just seconds after the door closes, I hear pounding on the door. Not knocking, full on POUNDING. I say I'll be out in a minute, them continue. Just a minute or two later, there's more pounding and a woman's voice yells, \"HELLO? HELLO?\" I'm annoyed and yell back, \"I. WILL. BE. OUT. IN. A. MINUTE.\" Remember, also that there is a bathroom right next to this one that she hasn't even tried. \n\n\n\nOne more detail of these cups: there's a lot of blood when emptying it. Lots. And in many restrooms, you need at least two flushes to get rid of it, most times you need 3. So I'm finally done, and I flush the toilet. The second she hears the flush she pounds again and screams, \"WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?!\" I look down, and this is definitely a three flusher. It definitely looks like a horror film in that toilet. But she's in a hurry, right? So I wash my hands quickly, not wasting time on another flush, and exit, smiling at her as I do. \n\n\n\nI didn't hear what it was, but I heard her shout something as the door closed behind her, and it put a smile on my face all day.",

A couple of friends of mine work in consultancy and I have heard this story through them a few times now.\n\nA small company had created a production planning algorithm themselves to calculate an efficient production schedule. Because they are small company, they didn't have the resources and knowledge for a state\\-of\\-the\\-art algorithm. Theirs worked, although the calculation time took up a couple of days. At some point, management decided this is too long and want to cut down on the calculation time and hire a consultancy firm to have a look at it.\n\nThe consultant quickly saw the algorithm was coded quite inefficiently and could reduce it to mere minutes, without changing the algorithm itself. Proud as they were with the result, they presented this to management. Unfortunately, management didn't trust the \"new\" results and they couldn't be convinced that the results were exactly the same. This is not uncommon at smaller companies, as they put a lot of trust and pride in anything they make themselves. So management told the consultant \"to make the calculation time longer, it can't be correct in its current state\".\n\nSomewhat defeated, the consultant went back to work and tried to work on his new assignment. He quickly found a very easy way: in the algorithm, he added just a few lines of codes that made the algorithm pause for 24 hours, before doing the same calculation in a matter of minutes. This time management is very excited and very happy with the results! They thank the consultant and both go their own way.\n\nA few years later, the same company is still working with the new algorithm, but they now decided the 24 hours it now takes is too long and want to decrease it even further. They contacted the same consultancy firm for their help. I think they could work something out...",

        "text": "Several years ago, state agencies in my state had a draconian allotment for travel that allowed only $15 a day for food (counting taxes and tips). You could either submit receipts for actual expenses for lodging (up to an amount that was also too low, but was more than $25), or go on the quarter system. The \"quarter system\" gave you $10 per every six hours of travel (six hours being 1/4 of a 24-hour day). And, you didn't have to submit receipts. \n\nThis was a win-win, given the crappy per diem limits for travel, so employees at the agency where I worked would share rooms to save money on lodging, and that gave them a bit more money to use for actual food (rather than stuffing their suitcases full of beef jerky or canned tuna from home). This agency had a lot of longtime, very loyal employees who took pride in saving the agency money, so their rationale was that the $40-per-day quarter system (for food and lodging) saved the agency money and gave them slightly better meals, and they didn't mind doubling up in a Motel 6 or something. \n\nWell, an over-zealous legislator somehow decided state employees were \"getting rich\" on the quarter system. He ranted and had hissy fits about how they were abusing the travel funds, and the state could save money by requiring receipts for everything. Along with that (since they finally realized $15 a day wouldn't feed a child, much less an adult), they raised the food per diem to $25 a day. But all lodging was now on the receipt system.  \n\nEmployees in my agency had fits over the insults the jerk legislator had leveled at everyone, and every single person I know of agreed they'd stay in the most expensive lodging they could find that still fit the allotted money. This meant people could now stay in places where breakfast was included. Heck, some places even had real soap,  and provided towels that didn't feel like sandpaper! \n\nNot only did the travel budget skyrocket, the administrative costs increased as well, since people had to process and review receipts. \n\nI am sure the a$$hole legislator ordered an audit so he could gloat over the results of his brilliant, money-saving bill, and then shoved the findings in a drawer.

People can be dicks to me, I'm not going to stop being kind unless it's clear that I'm being disrespect. \n\nI offered Hipster-Douche one of the corn dogs and he says, I don't want anything from you unless it's gas money. The day goes on and he continues to be an insufferable prick, and I ignore him for the most part since I have my own money to make. \n\nAt the end of the night we're at the hotel, and I pull a flask of crown from my bag (one of his favorites), I can see Hip staring at me as I'm taking a belt from the flask. \n\n\"Sorry, this isn't gas money.\" I say, taking another shot and putting it in my bag. \n\nThis morning while I'm loading merch I come back into the room and and hear HD discussing our route with the noob we brought on this trip, I ask what he's talking about. \n\nHD\n&gt;Talking about not talking to you. \n\nME\n&gt;What's the plan then\n\nHD\n&gt;You not talking to me unless I'm actually looking at you and speaking directly to you. \n\nMe\n&gt;Good plan\n\nThey start loading their bags and I go to get the last bin of merch. The door looked shut so I went back to the room key, and dickboy says that the room doesn't actually lock. So I go back and see the door isn't actually shut all the way. The door locks, they're just both dumb asses who couldn't shut it all the way last night. \n\nI grab the last bin and realize that the only things left in the room belong to Hippy D, so on the way out I just pull the door shut. Dude realized he left his phone and merch bag in the room and goes back for it. Comes back and asks me for a key asking how the door actually locks the one time he says it didn't. \n\nI just shrug and hand him my room key, saying nothing. Knowing that the magnet in my wallet already wiped the key card. \n\nI sat in quiet satisfaction knowing the extra time I had to answer emails this morning was because he had to schlep around trying to find someone to let him into the room so close to check out time.

If its newer, its not just sitting on the shelf.)*\n\nSo the first employee gets hired for the sales office on the West Coast and I'm told to send him \"a computer.\"  I dutifully drop a computer, dock &amp; power supplies into a box and ship them off.\n\n5 days later, I get an angry phone call from the West Coast.\n\n&gt;$MidLevelFunctionary: \"This is not a director-level laptop.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"You didn't ask for a director-level laptop. You asked for a laptop. A free one from our remaining systems.\"\n\n&gt;$MidLevelFunctionary: \"Surely you have a better laptop there.\"\n\n&gt;$Me:\"Not one that isn't in use, really. But I have a laptop from a recently laid off engineer that is available to be re-purposed. Its pretty good, I think.. Core i7, 16Gb RAM, SSD hard disk. Does that sound OK?\"\n\n&gt;$MidLevelFunctionary: \"Yes. Send that.\"\n\nI set the laptop up for the user and ship it to the West Coast.\n\n4 days later, I get an angry phone call.\n\n&gt;$MidLevelFunctionary: \"This laptop is HUGE! The power brick is the size of a two paperback books! This guy travels, you know!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, I didn't know that. You said nothing about travel. You said 'director-level' laptop and you really liked the specs of the machine I was going to send.\"\n\n&gt;$MidLevelFunctionary: \"He needs a smaller machine.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I don't really have a smaller machine that is 'director-level'.\"\n\n&gt;$MidLevelFunctionary: \"Why not?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Because we have VICE PRESIDENTS here running 5+ year old Core i5 laptops with 4Gb of RAM. Do you not understand that the technology that we have here is old and outdated??\"\n\nThen, they hire the first employee for the development office on the West Coast. I get the request to send him a laptop. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, I'm on it.\"  (different individual than the sales office...)\n\nThen the email follows up \n\n&gt;$DevelOfficeManager: \"He really would prefer a Macbook, 512SSD, 15 inch, no need for the touch bar, he likes the previous generation.\" \n\n&gt;$Me: \"We don't have any Macs here. At all.\"\n\n&gt;$DevelOfficeManager: \"What do you have?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"A Lenovo W530.\"\n\n&gt;$DevelOfficeManager: \"Send that.\"\n\nCan't wait for the explosion in 4 days. \"This thing is GIGANTIC!\"\n\nEDIT: Fix0red the \"conversation\" text like we do over at /r/talesfromtechsupport",

After I graduated from the Boot camp and my A-School as a Hospital Corpsman as lowly E-1, I was sent to MCRD Parris Island, SC as my 1st duty station. While there I was assigned to Recruit Sickcall. While there I was certified as a Screener Corpsman, Certified to take triage, blood draw,diagnoses and treat the recruits, after checking in the recruits to be treated. As the lowly E-1 I was to check in the recruits and seperate their medical files into its what departments they would go to. After all the recruits were logged in, I was to treat them. Long story short we had newly promoted E-4 who wanted to push his newly earned cheveron at me by reprimeting me and officially writing me up for not seeing the recruit as they were coming in, and when mentioning that there was no one else to checking in the patients, He basically told me to sign the write up or he will send me to Chief's Mast. So next day I obeyed his command and went me my private cubical/office and sat there waiting for the recruits so I can treat them, knowing there is nobody to admit the recruit.\n30 minutes later I have the sitty E-4 and NCOIC(E-6) yelling at me why I wasn't admitting the recruits, I told the E-6 the copy of my write-up and told him what happened especially the E-4's threat of sending me to the mast, So the E-6 told me that he will take care of it, and ordered the E-4 to go out and admit the patients in. Found out the next day the E-6 ordered the E-4 to admit in the patients in for the next 2 weeks, wrote up the E-4 and ripped off my write up.",

        "text": "I work at sea and occasionally deliver dry bulk \\(think dry cement, sand etc\\) to the clients and their contracted vessels.  This is done by using large air compressors to press\\-up \\(60\\-70psi/4.1 bar\\) the bulk storage tanks \\(2500 ft³/ 70.7m³\\) and then force the dry bulk out of the tanks, through our piping and then into the clients receiving hose.  The hoses tend to jump when product is being shipped and you have to keep people away: this large volume of compressed air and product is definitely a hazard.  A busted hose is a VERY bad day.  Even if no one gets hurt, its a mess.  Think of the scene in Volcano \\(1997\\) where the kid says [\"Everyone looks the same\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_v0Ma9Sp9I&amp;t=2m10s)\n\nSeveral years ago there was a shift in the technology and a boon in the market which allowed the delivery vessels and client's contracted vessels to be upgraded from older systems that used \\(30psi/2.0bar\\) to the 60psi systems mentioned above that we use today.  Occasionally, we would go to a client vessel that had not been upgraded and used the old 30psi systems.  It is standard procedure to politely warn the receiver that we are equipped for 60psi and this was their opportunity to let us know their limitations.  \n\nOne day we're given a call by the dispatcher and told us to make haste to a location and deliver cement.  We get underway and arrive on location within the next day and begin paperwork and radio calls to facilitate the transfer.  Now, in this industry as with many other industries, there is one guy that calls the shots and they usually have their head so far up their own ass that they are their own human centipede.  This guy was a shining example.  He asks whats taking us so long to get in position.  This process takes at least two hours but there is no reasoning with him, his emergency takes priority and he curtly suggests we ignore the rules and get the f\\*\\*\\* in position and start pumping some g\\*\\*damn cement.  Ok.  \n\nWe get into position, the hoses are made up and we're about to begin.  He is painfully impatient and no amount of wordsmithing will convey just what a pain in the ass this guy was.  We, on the delivery vessel, are a professional and take it all in stride and do our best to be inhumanly polite to each of his terse replies on the radio.  The last straw though was when we warned him of our increased pressure capabilities.  His dry bulk receiving system was definitely low pressure and we wanted to comfirm so we could make arrangements to dial back pressure on our side.  His very angry and arrogant response was \"Don't you worry about any of that, you just pump until we tell you stop.\"  Full stop.  \n\nNo problem!  We started pressurizing our tanks up to 65psi and threw open the discharge valves and began delivery.  Not less than a minite later we hear BOOF from inside our bridge and, to our horror and wonder, there is a cloud of cement somewhere over the receiving vessel just out of our sight; all we can see is a haze.  I was about to shutdown the pump but then was reminded by my captain that the company representative gave us very strict orders to pump until we were positively told to stop.  \n\nA whole minute went by before an alien screaming came through the radio \"SHUT IT OFF SHUT IT OFF\" above four octaves higher than the voice originally.  We shut down the pump and fortunately the wind was against us that day and didn't have cement residue covering us.  The client's contracted vessel though?  Cement.  Everywhere.  Everything was covered in a layer that event went to their engine room and into their engine intakes.  No one on our vessel was ever punished or even questioned regarding the incident though a couple of us just knew we were going to get fired.  We kept a recording on the radio frequency though just in case but never had to be used.  I'm not good with closing statements.",

        "text": "Obligatory on mobile, please don't hate me.\n\nTo start, I currently work as a environmental service technician for a hospital - which is a very fancy way of saying housekeeper. We're the ones that disinfect everything in the room once a patient gets discharged. \n\nTwo big things to remember:\n\n1. We're not supposed to take care of medicines,  bodily fluids, IV liquids, personal information, etc. Nursing (or more accurately, Nursing Assistants) are suppose to take these things out of the room before we get there.\n\n2. We HAVE to listen to the nursing staff on the floor - their word is law. (This is important for later)\n\nThis whole thing started two weeks ago. Normal day of work - birds humming, bees singing, no one's pissed me off yet. A good day. I get a page to go clean a discharge on my normal floor. As I mosey on down to the room, I notice the ridiculously lazy, self-entitled, bitch of a Nursing Assistant (here after known as BNA) sitting at the nursing station across from the room I need to clean. *Fantastic.* A courteous hello from both of us, and I move on. Still a good day.\n\nNow if you remember from five sentences ago, it is BNA's job to strip the room of the aforementioned items before I get there. If that was done, ladies and gentlemen, we would not be here. I understand that nurses can get busy, and sometimes I try to grab what I feel comfortable doing or work around it until they get there. But I am timed on how quickly I get these rooms done and there are rules I have to follow. They know this and understand. Usually. \n\nI get through cleaning this room, and all the while BNA has not once gotten out of her chair to do her part. This has been over 45 minutes of me waiting for her. Now, I could have asked her to help. I know that. But, I also know that this is a reoccurring issue on her shifts. So I go ahead, do the best I can throwing things away, finish up, and hand all of the confidential items to the nearest nurse down the hall. Please note that we **are** trained what to do with this stuff for the most part, they just want nursing to do it for liability reasons.\n\nAt this point, I'm annoyed that I had to do her job for her, but it got done. Whatever. Then, as I'm walking my cart back to my station, I hear her squeaky ass little tennis shoes on a mission to ruin my good day.\n\n**BNA:** Hey, did you throw away SuchnSuch IV fluid?\n\n**Me:** Probably? Sorry, I threw away what was left in the room, and I gave the rest to the nurse.\n\n**BNA:** It was still sealed! That's such a waste. You shouldn't just throw things away.\n\n**Me:** Sorry, I'll double check next time.\n\n**BNA:** No, that's not your job. Do not throw anything away unless I say you can. Just let me do it.\n\n**Me:** YOU GOT IT\n\nNow, I'm having a great day. Technically, what she said is correct. It's not my job to take care of those things. It's HERS. And - fun fact - I can't do my job until she does HERS. But, I'm a good little housekeeper, and I do what I'm told. If you've ever worked in healthcare, you know the most important thing is time. Rooms have to be turned over for new patients, and I promise there are always more. This means that I can't just wait around for someone to decide to get off their ass. *UNLESS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO.*\n\nSo, for the last two weeks, anytime I've had a discharge, I wait until nursing has done their part completely. Which is never a problem (my other NAs rock), unless it's her shift. *How about that? *So, my room times have plummeted whenever she is working, because I have to wait, and - on occasion - go and find her to do her job. This isn't that annoying to be honest, because I get the tiny little satisfaction of constantly making her get up (I don't think she realized how often I did this for nursing anyway). \n\nBut, this whole ordeal has not gone unnoticed. \n\n**Sup:** Why isn't that room done?\n\n**Me:** Sorry, I had to wait for nursing to strip the room.\n\n**Sup:** Again? Just strip it yourself, and ask if you need help.\n\n**Me:** But BNA told me I couldn't do that, because it wasn't my job.\n\n**Sup:** ...\n\n**Me:** ...\n\n**Sup:** I'll take care of it.\n\nToday, I found out she had a \"little chat\" with the nurse manager. It's been a good day.\n\nTLDR: Bitchy nursing assistant wouldn't do her job, so I did it for her. She got mad, and told me it wasn't my place, so not only did I make her get up constantly to actually do her job, I also got her yelled at by her supervisor, because mine complained.",

        "text": "So, this gem of a tale comes from my father, who has worked at the same place as a linear accelerator technician and electrical engineer for nearly 20 years. When my father first started working there, he received an awesome benefits package. Dental, medical, and mental health insurance that works in many places.\n\nWhen I was in middle/high school though, my mother was diagnosed with a severe heart condition that has required surgeries too numerous to count and put us with a quarter million dollars of medical debt. This quarter million dollars of medical debt was after our insurance paid out 90% of the procedures' costs. This has not pleased my father's workplace, who are the ones paying the premiums, at all. They have tried several times to screw my family over by claiming that my mother and father aren't really married and then removing her from the insurance plan. We usually go through a long, drawn out process of showing a marriage certificate and then having a lawyer call, and finally getting the city to notarize an affidavit from the county clerk to say, \"Hey, these two are married and have been for 25 years, quit trying to remove them from the insurance plan you stingy fucks.\"\n\nTheir latest method of squeezing money from us to pay for the premiums on the plan they offered in the first place was to pinch pennies from my father anytime he went to lunch. The place he works has a really nice cafeteria for a hospital and I genuinely know people who go to this hospital cafeteria for lunch and dinner because it beats a lot of restaurants. The powers-that-be now required him to clock in and out every time he ate lunch/dinner, so that they could drain 30 minutes of pay per day each day, which would roughly be 10 hours of pay per paycheck.\n\nThe glorious stupidity of this order was that my father had long ago called payroll for another matter and the policy of the hospital was that if you ate lunch/dinner in your office, you could do it on the clock, because you were taking a working lunch/dinner. The irony was that payroll was also already deducting 30 minutes per meal per my father's request from years ago.\n\nSo, with this knowledge in hand, my father calls payroll and tells them to stop automatically deducting 30 minutes per meal since he now will be clocking in and out under the hospital's new system. They agree, but since my father always takes working lunches and dinners, he has been coming home with 10 hours of extra overtime pay per pay period. \n\nTry to be stingy, and you'll just end up paying more.\n\nEdit: As a few users pointed out, my information about insurance was incorrect and based off of a misunderstanding of what my father explained. Forgive me for not being well-versed in insurance law to know it was wrong :P. So, currently my father got his insurance when the hospital he works at had just opened, many years ago. Because of this, they were offering an insurance package where he has to pay almost nothing extra for full family coverage for medical, dental, and mental healthcare where the insurance agency pays 90% of all procedures and medications. For our state, this package is really good and not offered anymore at most places, but he was grandfathered into the plan and has been able to keep it. When my dad was shopping around, he was asking other linear accelerator engineers at a conference about their insurance packages and what was the industry norm. To get the package that my father does now, it would be a substantial monthly payment that he currently doesn't have.",

It was a small more casual playing exam as part of a small brass quintet. \n\nNow, my primary instrument is saxophone so I'm​ not the best at performing in a small brass ensemble when I really need to look at the music to make sure I get the right notes out. However, playing in an ensemble, you really need to pay attention to the other members to make sure everyone is in time with each other and playing at the same tempo. \n \nSo of course, our instructor asks us to look at our other members and I take this with a grain of salt because I'm definitely used to being able to just look up straight from my music and see everyone else. The problem with playing the euphonium I'm using is that there's a big ass bell in the way and it can be hard to see around your own instrument. \n\nSo of course, as soon as we start playing, I turn to look at the person beside me, full body turn and everything. As soon as that happens, everyone starts laughing hysterically at what they just witnessed, including the instructor. \n\nSo, after everyone gains their composure, we start playing again but I do it more discreetly.

        "text": "Have not seen this here before, hope it is not a repost.\n\nIn episode 7, where Agents Ford and Tench are flying back to Quantico after interviewing Jerry Brudos, they are sitting next to each other in a triple row of seats. Another passenger approaches them and says that Agent Tench is in his seat.  Tench responds that the passenger can have the aisle seat, it's roomier, because he and Ford would like to do some work on the flight.  The passenger insists and Tench once again suggests the passenger would be more comfortable in the aisle seat and that this seating arrangement would benefit all 3 of them.  The passenger insists by saying he believes sitting in the seat his ticket is for (the middle seat) is the only proper course of action.  Tench acquiesces and moves to the aisle so the passenger can claim his ticketed seat in the middle of the 3 seat row.\n\nDuring the flight, Tench begins his malicious compliance by handing Agent Ford a magazine ad for luggage with a woman dressed in a tight outfit like a magician's assistant costume from the time period (1970's).  He then hands Ford pictures taken by Brudos of his victims in lingerie, which just look like poorly framed pictures of women trying to pose sexy, if you don't know the context of how these pictures were taken.  The passenger in the middle, of course, looks at every picture as it is passed from Tench to Ford, as is human nature.  Tench asks Ford what all these pictures have in common, and Ford responds they are all sexualized.\n\nTench finishes his lesson on malicious compliance by agreeing with Ford that the pictures are indeed sexualized and that is how they will get Brudos to open up to them in future interviews.  He then says, but we have to get the right kind of sexualization for Brudos, and slowly passes Ford the final picture.  It is a woman's severed foot inside a slingback high heel shoe; another one of Brudos' pictures of the actual physical trophy of his first murder victim.  The passenger sees this photo and starts stammering that he would like to switch seats now, and Agent Tench looks him square in the face and says no, I'm good, lot of leg room in the aisle seat, I'm pretty comfortable.\n\nThis is a textbook example of malicious compliance, and so excellently illustrated in this quick scene in Mindhunters.

        "text": "More than a year ago, we were expanding multiple production lines and adding in new ones, in order to keep up with producing ever-more complex parts while reducing manufacturing costs. Multiple conflicting goals, a typical manufacturing day.\n\nOne my workplace's departments has a large side business that brings in lots of revenue. They had contracts with other companies in the area to supply, assemble and maintain manufacturing equipment, while also being responsible for helping the production departments at my workplace. Bear in mind that my company's main source of revenue is designing and selling products, and services that go along with the products. Not fabricating, assembling and maintaining heavy production machinery at other companies.\n\nMy department wanted to go with the lowest bidders, aka the outside vendors. The equipment service department pulled strings in senior management to force us to buy most of the equipment from them, at a higher cost of course. This made some of the production engineers and project managers bitter because they had to revise the costs of their projects, and I believe one production line had to scale back their expansion due to having to use more expensive machinery.\n\nIn one part of my production line, we had four identical machines. Some of the production lines also had the same machines, although they were installed sometime after we had ours.\n\nI opened up one of the machines to look at its internal operations before starting on a PLC control systems coding project, and noticed one of the parts had a crack on it. I ended up finding another part that had some serious cracking, and what appeared to be galvanic corrosion in a corner. I definitely did not remember seeing those problems in those machines when they were first installed. I called in other engineers and production workers, and they all agreed that the machine was going to break pretty soon.\n\nI took some photos and submitted a warranty claim to the equipment service. (Can't upload any of them without having a meeting with HR and legal)\n\nAn equipment service technician came over, looked inside and then called in an engineer. That engineer noticed our maintenance log reported an oil change that was done a few days late, and used that to deny warranty claim.\n\nI asked in an email if the slightly late oil change was sufficient to cause all of the cracking and corrosion problems, and his response was pretty much \"Why are you asking us about these problems if we had just denied your warranty claim? It's your problem now.\"\n\nI decided to look up the equipment service's warranty policies, and it clearly stated that it will deny claims if misuse was a root cause or a contributing factor to a failure. I confronted the engineer again, explaining what I found in their policy, and asked again if the slightly late oil change was a root cause or a contributing factor to all of those problems.\n\nThe engineer said yes.\n\nI then asked if I should let all of the production lines know about dangers of late maintenance, and the response was something along the lines of, \"All of you should know already, but go ahead anyways.\"\n\nI contacted my manager about it and asked if we could put up a giant warning notice on our whiteboard facing towards the walkway (where everyone can see it), stating that equipment service said that an oil change that is a few days late can lead to fatigue cracks and corrosion problems. The warning notice also had pictures of the cracks and corrosion. The manger and I also reached out to other production lines, explained our situation, asked them to put up the same warning notice on their whiteboards, and also suggested that they should check their own machines that were the same model as the soon-to-be-broken machine. Someone wrote on our whiteboard, \"Should I change my car's engine oil more frequently?\"\n\nFew days later, according to some of the engineers from another production line, the head of our production department noticed the warning notices and asked how the hell could a few days late oil change cause all of those problems. Apparently they suggested him to contact my production line. I handed over the email conversations to him when he came over to find out what was going on.\n\nEquipment service ended up doubling down on their engineer's claim to avoid defeat, and now senior management has to deal with another inter-departmental conflict. No idea how it's going to turn out, but equipment service did make an \"exemption\" for us and fixed the machine.\n\nOh, and the other three similar machines are having a similar issue as well. The other production lines are also reporting cracks and corrosion problems. If the equipment service had started investigating the problem much earlier, they could've fixed those machines before they started to break down. At this rate, it looks like lots of machines are going down before they come up with a permanent solution, and the company's management hates unscheduled downtime (very big on just-in-time inventory and etc).\n\nEDIT: What I'm not looking forward to is the inevitable engineers vs. engineers conflict. Someone (or a group of them) in equipment service designed those machines, and many more built them.",

        "text": "Back in 2003 I was just starting out in the world after being in the Navy for 4 years.  I was going to college and I got a job working the help desk at a local law firm.  It was pretty chill.  I was put on a salary and not hourly like many other people because I was expected to answer the phone at all hours.   The deal was that I had to work around 40 hours a week and I could work them any way that worked for me.\n\nI would stay late on days I didn't have school and would leave early on days I did.  I always made sure that if I left early, I would come in early as well.  I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't ripping this place off.  The Legal Administrator was cool with it because she saw me there when she got there each morning and knew I stayed late most days. \n\nWell her assistant had a REAL problem with it.  She would comment as I left on days I had school, \"Must be nice to leave here at 2pm.\" or I'd get an email from her, \"I came by your desk today, but since you're not here AGAIN, here is what I need.\"\n\nShe really really hated it. \n\nAbout 3 years into me working there, the Legal Admin found a new job and her assistant took her job.  And you can bet her first order of business was to stop me from leaving early.\n\nShe told me to stop doing it, so I went to the Partners and told them what was going on.  They sided with me and told her to let me leave early on the days I had class.\n\nShe of course didn't just leave it at that.  She realized I never clocked in and out.  Since I was on salary it wasn't required.  She decided that I would need to move to hourly because I needed to clock in and out. The partners allowed her to move me to hourly because I was making only around $40,000 at the timeand they didn't care as long as the computers worked and I was happy I could go to school.\n\nShe beamed as she told me I had to start clocking in and out.  She was practically giddy when she told me I was no longer on salary.  It was like her entire existence was tied to whether I clocked in or not.\n\nI just went about my business as usual and did exactly what she said.  I clocked in every morning I arrived early and I clocked out when I left, even if I stayed until 10pm.  If someone called me at home to help with their personal computer problems, I clocked in because I was helping a partner and clocked out when I was done.\n\nMy first paycheck after she made me start clocking in and out came with 20 hours of overtime on it.  I clearly didn't realize how much more than 40 hours I was working. \n\nSHE was livid.  She told the partners that I must have been tricking the system because she saw me leave early on a couple days and she wanted me fired for doing computer tricks. They looked over my sheet and saw that I was there most days at 6:30 am and some days didn't leave until after 8.  \n\nShe was not too happy when they told her to leave me alone.  And they also told me I could go back to salary.  I told them that I was happy getting the overtime.   They agreed to let me stay hourly.  I made about $15,000 more that year than I had in the past.  I was super stoked about the extra money.  And every time she handed me a paycheck she would give me the stink eye. ",

So that means new rubber gloves, new pack of sponges, new toilet brush, new swiffer and broom because I don't want all the germs from the previous equipment to taint the bathrooms, and you can bet your ass I'm gonna use an entire package of swiffer pads to clean the floors. I also threw in a can of air freshener to help it smell as clean as it looks. All in total this cost the store $35 dollars. I've been getting fresh supplies every night for the past week.

        "text": "I worked for a charter school in the era of obsessive state testing, and there were extremely specific rules that students &amp; staff had to follow during state test days.\n\nOne of the rules was that after students finished their test, they had two options: silently read a book or silently put their head down. That was it. No other options. It's also worth mentioning that there's no time limit on the NY state exams, so our school gave the kids a mandatory minimum of 4 hours... to answer ~30 math questions. Needless to say, they all finished after about 2 hours, and then I, as the proctor, was left trying to keep a room full of antsy 11-year-olds absolutely silent for 2 more hours. \n\nIf you've ever hung out with 11-year-olds, then you already know that keeping them silent for 2 minutes is hard, much less 2 hours. They need to be focused on doing something in order to not distract one another. In classes, after we took a test, I'd usually let my kids doodle on scrap paper, which kept them silent &amp; focused on themselves. However, on the state exam, the school gave us the aforementioned rule about either reading a book or putting their head down. On top of that, students were not allowed any scrap paper on the state exam. Because the school leadership knew I liked to let my kids draw, they explicitly told me, \"Your kids are not allowed to draw after they're finished taking the exam.\" Cool. Got it. \n\nMe being the compliant proctor that I was, I read the students the full instructions for the exam: Do all your work in the test booklet. Your answers go on the answer sheet, but you're allowed to write anywhere in the test booklet. Once you hand in your test booklet, you are done taking the test, at which time you must either silently read a book or silently put your head down. And then since they were 11 and not smart enough to read between the lines, I flat out told them, \"Once you're done taking the test, if you want or need to draw, DON'T HAND IN YOUR TEST BOOKLET. Keep it, draw all over it, and as long as you're silent you are still 100% following the rules.\"\n\nI gotta say, nothing beat seeing the faces on the school leadership when they saw my kids' reference sheets absolutely smothered in doodles: \"What's wrong? They hadn't finished their tests yet, and they were allowed to make marks anywhere in their test booklets...\"\n\nTL;DR: School/state had stupid rules about what kids could/couldn't do after taking state tests, so I followed them in order to help my kids stay quiet once they finished testing.\n\n",

If you give me ambiguous instructions, I'll do the one most likely to get me in trouble.\n\nSo, I live in a heavily flooded city. Most of our trial system is underwater. The mainstreets don't have bike lines, so I've been using the sidewalks to get around town. I'm headed to a flooded area, very close to a pedestrian bridge used to cross the river to the other side of town. Couple signs in the area clearly marking the area as \"off limits\" to vehicles \\(which, includes pedal bikes by the way!\\). Police and city trucks are at each sign of each street. I biked through anyways. Usually \"No vehicles\" means no cars, not pedal bikes. But that isn't the compliance, just the backstory.\n\nStory time:\n\nPolice: \"The signage back there includes Pedal Bikes. Please leave the area immediately and come back on foot if you want pictures.\"\n\nMe: \"Leave the area? No problem Officer!\"\n\nSo I turned around, and started to pedal back the way I came with the officer behind me. As I'm nearing his patrol car, I turn back around and pedal as hard and fast as I can, switching gears to gain more speed. Now, this water is extremely deep. I'm 6'2 for reference, and this water was easily 4' deep \\(at its deepest point\\). I hop off my bike \\(I'm now like 70&amp;#37; through the flood\\) and turn around. The officer is now at the side of the water shaking his head as he yells \"That's not what I meant you dickhead!\"\n\nI went home soaking damn wet and showered. At least it wasn't cold outside \\(21C\\). Water was fucking freezing though.\n\nTLDR: Cops asked me to leave the area \\- so rather then taking the dry way through, I went through the flood.

More specifically, I work for their fraud team. My department's job is to tell customers why their payments have been stopped and ensure them that we will push the funds through. Unless there's a credit into the account of which we require proof that they belong to the customer. In these cases it's usually because they're doing something that they shouldn't be.\n\nMore often than not, payments are stopped because it's an unusually large transaction being sent or that they're paying a company and/or person that they haven't paid before. When we spot these transactions and the customer confirms that it is fraud, the card must be blocked and a fresh one sent out, whilst we investigate what happened and how. Most customers are okay with this because they're assured that by getting a new card it will stop the fraudsters spending on their card. Most. Out of 20 calls you'll get 3/4 scenarios that don't go as planned.\n\nI will be \\`ME\\` and the customer will be \\`DL\\` for Daft Lady.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n&gt;**ME**: Hi there. Welcome to \\`Bank\\`. You're speaking to Peace. How may I help you today?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**DL**: You've stopped my card! I can't even use it online!!\n\nThat always lets me know how tough the call will be. I pray for the day customers stop shouting from the get go. Anyway, we do the usual verification 'blah' and I proceed to inform her that I will read through some payments on her card, and all she has to is either confirm them as genuine or fraud. There turns out to be three payments she does not recognise. Fraud.\n\n&gt;**ME**: Okay \\`**DL**\\` you don't recognise these payments we would need to block your card and send you out a brand new one. This would stop the fraudsters making anymore payments on your card, online.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**DL**: Oh. But I need £50 from the machine. Can't you just stop those payments and leave my card unblocked?\n\nThe amount of customers that think this is possible makes me want to \\*facedesk\\*. Ya can't stop something that's already left. That's why we're going to investigate and trace the funds. We have IP addresses of every single payment.\n\n&gt;**ME**: No ma'am. Your card has been compromised and therefore we need to secure it by blocking the card and sending you a new one.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**DL**: But I can't have it blocked. I need my card!\n\nNow when customers argue like this, I like to give them options. It usually lets them realise that we need to block the card. Usually.\n\n&gt;**ME**: \\(in the same professional tone\\). So you have two options. 1\\) I can secure your card by blocking it and sending out a new one which ensures that the fraudsters can't use your card. Or, 2\\) I can leave it unblocked for more fraud to happen. What would you like me to do?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**DL**: Well, the sarcasm doesn't really help now, does it? So that can stop.\n\n\\(internally\\) B!xxx those are literally your only options. There's no sarcasm.\n\n&gt;**ME**: I'm sorry you feel that way ma'am but there's nothing else I can do. If you want cash you can go to the branch with some ID and you can draw out money over the counter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**DL**: Ooh there's no way I can go to the branch now at this time. I'm disabled and can't get anyone to drop me off. \\(She had four hours before it closed\\). Tell you what. Leave the card unblocked so I can get some cash from the machine and I'll then call you tomorrow so you can block the card.\n\nAnd it was at this precise moment that I muted her and literally facepalmed. I went back:\n\n&gt;**ME**: Okay, but that would mean that \\``Bank` will not be liable for any future fraud payments that happen on your card. So from right now until you ring us back if there are anymore transactions that you claim you didn't do, they will not be investigated. Are you sure you still want to leave the card unblocked and open to fraud.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**DL**: Yeah that's  fine. I understand.\n\nI finished of the call and wrote in her account notes about everything that she has said. Just to back myself up. Then I told all my colleagues this story and they laughed. I wish I was allowed to forcibly block cards regardless of what the customer want's but alas, it is their money and if they want access to it we have to allow that. Yes, there will be more tales.",

She was the new manager after the old one was demoted for faking a sex complaint against me. One day, BaN decided to promote their new cookie, a smores cookie, by offering them for just a dollar more if you bought a different one. They were pretty decent cookies so it wasnt a bad deal, but they were big cookies. Most people wouldnt be able to finish two. We also never sold an insane amount of cookies, usually selling around 20-30 per day.\n\nThis is the conversation she and I had the before the first day of the sale:\n\nMe: How many smores should I make\n\nD: 36\n\nMe: That seems like a lot to sell over the weekend\n\nD: No per day\n\nMe: wait 36 day? Thats going to be so much work staggering them in and out of the oven per day, and we'll never sell them all\n\nD: just make them all at once and make sure you make 36 of them. I dont want to run out\n\nMe: okay then...\n\nShe then left and the next day I opened. Before I opened the cafe I did as she asked, and made all 36 smores cookies. Now normally we (everyone but D) staggered the baking times so we also had a fresh tray of warm cookies to offer, but not with the smores. After the first day, we sold 8-10. Not the end of the world as they will hold for 2-3 days before going too stale.\n\nNext day comes and I am closing. I find out she made another 30 cookies in the morning, and they had only sold something like 7 of them, 3 of which were off the new hot trays. That meant we had 25 cookies about to go bad the next day. Sunday comes and I am the closer again. Another 30 cookies had been baked on her order, and again about 10 were sold, half of which were fresh ones.\n\nSo that left about 20 cookies to be thrown out that night. I called the store manager (SM) over to check out the waste log (which he needs to do each night), and when he gets to the cookies he is horrified.\n\nSM: why are we throwing out so many smores?\n\nMe: D insisted we make 36 on day one and another 30 each day. I tried to tell her it was a bad idea but she wouldnt listen.\n\nSM: are you serious?\n\nMe: Yup. She wouldnt listen to me at all about this.\n\nThe SM just grew silent, finished checking everything, and went on his way to lock everything up. All told, of the nearly 100 cookies made, something like 40-50 cookies were thrown out. D got grilled pretty hard for that, and from then on she got increasingly nasty to me for throwing her under the bus. But the store manager always had my back\n\nTl;dr manager insists we make 100 cookies over a weekend. I tell her its a bad idea but she wont listen. We throw out nearly half of them.\n\nEDIT: spelling error.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago. I was the junior person in an office of mainly people older than me. As such, I was the geeky type person and the go-to guy for people to get advice on technical stuff. One day I found a great deal on laptops in Costco. They were selling some really nice Sony Vaios for a really cheap price. I bought one and would have bought more to sell on but I didn’t really have the cash. My irksome team leader overheard me telling this at lunchtime in the office and then immediately went to Costco and bought about 5 laptops and immediately put them up for sale on places like craigslist, Ebay and gumtree (a UK second hand selling site), all the while crowing that today’s youth liked to waste their money whilst the canny older generations saved their money for lucrative investments. \n\n\nHe sold one immediately for almost double the price he paid in Costco. This emboldened him to put the rest at 2.5 times the price he paid for in Costco. For about a week there was no update and then one day there was a cornucopia of excitement from where he sat. He had arranged to sell them all to someone in Amsterdam for the inflated asking price. He talked about what an absolute wheeler dealer he was and kept on telling people what profit he was making and what he was going to do with it.\n\n\nI told him that it was quite sketchy to ship goods privately abroad and it would be difficult to get any recourse if things went south even if it went to places in Western Europe. Of course, this was me “being jealous” of such a big shot and that I knew nothing and I should keep my mouth shut as I had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to warn him again but then I was called into the Assclown manager’s office about “prying” into other people’s financial affairs and that I was not to talk about anything that wasn’t work related with this guy, as he had obviously complained about me. I received a verbal warning and warned that if I did it again then I would receive a written warning despite my protestations that I was merely reacting to what this guy was saying and I was trying to help him.\n\n\nOf course the buyer at the last minute changed the shipping details to Lagos, Nigeria and the irksome team leader started to show everyone the paypal email confirmation that he had received of the money. I should have told him to log into paypal to check that the money had arrived and it wasn’t just a fake email. But I would have received a written warning. So I didn’t. He packs up the laptops and sends them airfreight to Lagos. \n\n\nNext day the teamleader wasn’t quite so full of bombast as he had been previously. It took a few other people to pry the story about how he had been completely ripped off and had received nothing via paypal. I was exerting a herculean effort to keep the tiniest of smirks from appearing on my face but my efforts were in vain. “YOU FUCKING KNEW WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME!” he screamed into my face. \n\n\nBut I carried on with my work and didn’t say a word. \n\n\n\nEdit: Quite a few questions in the comments so let me clear up a few. \n\n* Yes, it was a very toxic machismo workplace with lots of shouting around sales guys trying to outdo each other. \n* Assclown manager and Irksome Teamleader were very good personal friends. \n* Assclown manager was the local HR in effect. Everything had to go by him and the physical HR department was a tiny place very far away with only a few staff. \n* I had already made up my mind to leave well before this and was looking for new jobs. I didn't want to get fired even for spurious reasons without another job. \n* I didn't retort to Irksome at the end as no matter what I would have said he would have gotten Assclown to write me up. It was a small office and no one would have stood up for me as a witness as Irksome was the alpha male and most senior in the open plan area. \n* No, this isn't bullshit.  \n",

As part of this, I spend a lot of time belaying (holding the rope so climbers don't fall) for people who come in to climb, everything from birthday parties, to people that want to learn to climb, school field trips, etc. Over this past summer, we had a large group of about 50 kids from a summer camp come in for an hour and a half of climbing. Nothing too terrible, but after and hour and change of screaming children, I'm ready to be done for the day.\n\nWith about 10 minutes left, I'm working at a rope station with a 5.8 on it. For non climbers, that is basically the upper end of something a brand new climbers will likely be able to climb. Then, one of the campers comes over and says he wants to climb the hardest wall we have. I tried to dissuade him from it, but he wanted to try it. So I set up a 5.13.\n\nHe didn't even get off the ground.\n\n\nEdit: the wiki page for the grading system we use for climbs, as there was a bit of confusion. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Decimal_System",

        "text": "I'm a cashier a small grocery store. It's a local place with a lot of regulars. There's a bakery and deli in the back that is THE place to get food/doughnuts in the whole county. It's been family owned and operated for the past 30 years.\n\nI've worked here for about 1 year. The food is excellent, the staff are amazing; and the customers are my friends and neighbors.\n\nBecause this place is 30 years old and family owned, a lot of the staff are starting to retire and hand things off to the next generation. The current owner (we'll call her Kelly) who is the daughter of the man who built the place, was recently diagnosed with cancer. She's doing fine but the store is very fast paced because we have a small staff.\n\nKelly decided to hire a manager from outside the family to help run the place while she is in treatment. There are many things I'd like to call or new manager but we'll call her \"Brenda\". Brenda and I went to school together. We never really interacted much but what i do know is she's a controlling, micromanaging bitch.\n\nBrenda is only 21 but has an associate's in accounting and is trying to gain some experience in order to get a better job. This is fine as Kelly really only needs her to keep the books straight while she is sick.\n\nRemember how I said she's controlling? He first day on her own she sent the head of the bakery home because he was wearing \"non-handbook complaint\" shoes.\n\nOur handbook is some generic, small business, thing made by some other company for stores like ours. We barely follow it (even the owner) and most of us didn't even know it existed.\n\nBrenda had been working with me for about a week learning the register. For the most part there was no issues until one day a newer cashier asked why my uniform didn't have a anything printed on it.\n\nI explained when Kelly only ordered shirts once a year (more like every two) and when she placed her last order she only ordered up to 2XL and I need a 3X so I just got a blue polo in the same style.\n\nNow, the reason for this is I'm very busty. Kelly is pretty cool and just said i can wear a plain polo until she makes another order. I actually looked at the tag so I could by the same brand and shade of blue.\n\nBrenda was pissed. \"So you think you can just wear what ever you want?! You need to be wearing a company issued uniform.\"\n\nI said \"they don't fit. Kelly let's me wear these\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous. Nobody gets special treatment\"\n\n\"Ya but...\"\n\n\"I don't care! Your going to wear one!\"\n\nShe pulled a 1XL out of the back and the it at me. \"I'm going to lunch. That better be on when I get back.\"\n\nSo I put it on. Needless to say it looked ridiculous. I could even come close to buttoning it up. And pulling it down to cover my mid section meant showing a LOT of cleavage.\n\nWhen I came back to the office the other cashier's mouths dropped. \"Dude. You can't fight wear that on the floor!\" Well, I'm gonna.\n\nAbout an hour and a half into Brenda's usual 2hour lunch Kelly comes into the store furious and red faced. Apparently, people had been calling her directly at home and complaining. \"Charlie! What the actual fuck are you wearing! You look like a God Damn hooker!\"\n\nI explained everything to Kelly and how awful Brenda had been to us all. Then I said she left an hour and a half ago and she'll be back in 30 min. When I said this Kelly broke. She couldn't make words and just made confused sounds instead.\n\n\"Off the floor. Now.\" She called Brenda who came back almost immediately. She took one look at me and get eyes bugged out of her head. I stuck my chest out for effect. Then she looked at Kelly and when white as a ghost.\n\nKelly calmly said \"Everyone, even management, gets a 30 min break. Clearly your not able to make the decisions required by your position. You're fired.\"\n\nAfter Brenda left she turned to me and said I should never pull a stunt like this again",

        "text": "So when I was younger and had very limited job options in my field, I worked a summer at [zoological/aquarium institution that later gained a very bad reputation], caring for the reptiles and amphibians. For some reason armadillos were also under my care, because obv they look like reptiles from far away so they must be reptiles.\n\nAnyway, because I wasn't a presenter, I wasn't supposed to answer any ~~customer~~ guest questions about the animals, and had been reprimanded several times for answering basic questions about the species' ecology, like what they eat, where the live, predators, etc. I was supposed to direct any questions to the signage and could answer no questions except the name of the animal and its species.\n\nTowards the end of my time there, one of the armadillos in the habitat died (she was extremely old, nothing bad or painful). The other of the two armadillos was very visibly distressed suddenly being alone. His species can live alone, but often live in small groups, and regardless, this individual was very distressed living alone. I brought this issue to the department head, who more or less dismissed it. He's a businessman, not a zoologist, it doesn't really matter to him if one of the hundreds of animals is a bit distressed, is the vibe I got from him. Quite pissed off, I began preparing very detailed logs of the armadillo's behaviour, as management is legally required to intervene if there is valid medical concern for the animal's health. \n\nSeveral days later, a ~~customer~~ guest came in and was watching the armadillo. She was a nice, little old lady and was very curious about him. \nLady: Oh it's so silly! Is it a boy or a girl?\n\nChecking for supervisors around, Me: He's a boy\n\nL: Oh how cute! How old is he? Where did he come from?\n\nM: He's 5, so he's still fairly young. He'd be a teenager or young adult if he was human. His species is from South America- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia. He himself was born at another zoo, but had to move because their habitat couldn't keep as many as they had.\n\nL: Oh so they're social? Why is he alone?\n\nM: I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to answer questions about the animals.\n\nShe looks very confused. M: I am just here to care for the animals, I am not supposed to answer questions directly about them.\n\nCatching on, L: Was he always alone?\n\nM: I'm not supposed to answer questions about animals we no longer have either.\n\nL: Do you happen to have a manager I can speak to?\n\nM: I do! You should really direct those last few questions his way\n\nShe very sweetly expresses her concern for the armadillo. When Department Head openly lies about him not being social and never having lived with another armadillo, she asks for the phone number for the corporate office. \n\nThe very next day, Big Time Corporate Guy visits our department and examines what's going on. Armadillo is relocated to a habitat with a few other armadillos, where his stereotypic behaviours nearly disappear. Department Head is reprimanded, placed on leave, and forced to rewrite standard procedures for care for every species under his supervision.\n\nedit: formatting and fixing a sentence",

        "text": "Read a couple of McDonalds Malicious Compliance stories and they reminded me of my own-I worked at Macca’s for about 8 years while I was at school, then uni.\n\nMcDonalds order process for those who are unsure; orders come through on the screen, buns go in the toaster, wraps/boxes get put on the line ready to be sauced and moved on. After working there for a while you realized that similar burgers (cheeseburgers, quarter pounders, McDoubles etc.) were faster to line up in bigger lots if needed because they all had the same sauce/mustard combo.\n\nThis story happened after I’d already been working there for 4-5 years, and some genius manager decided that the absolute fastest way to get burgers out was by making 2 at a time, and placed signs up everywhere.\n\nThis manager walked down the line when it was quiet and I happened to have three cheeseburgers on the line about to be sauced- she yelled at me for doing this, and pointed at the ‘2 at a time saves time’ sign and told me under no circumstances was I to get more than two burgers out and sauced at the same time - I started to argue and she told me to listen to her because she knows best! I listened to her but smiled on the inside because I knew what was about to happen.\n\nSo lunch rush begins and we have quickly have 10+ orders on the screen. Many of them have multiple quarter pounders, cheeseburgers and McDoubles in them. So I did exactly as instructed - two in the toaster, two wraps out, sauced two, then did the next two. As you can imagine when there are in excess of 30 burgers on the screen and orders flowing in every few seconds, two at a time was not saving time. Eventually our store manager walked out and asked what the fuck was going on-I pointed to the signs and told him I’d been in trouble already off our other manager for not following the rules, so I was just doing my job. He went bright red and I could almost see the steam coming out of his ears-he walked over to the sign I pointed to, ripped it down, told us to forget about the rule, stormed into the office and absolutely annihilated the other manager - we could hear him yelling, even over the noise in the rush. She eventually walked out meekly, pulled the other signs down, and apologized to the ground as she walked past me. Surprisingly no one ever heard the ‘2 at a time saves time’ mantra again in our store, and that manager barely spoke to me for the rest of my time there, greatly improving my enjoyment at work. \n\n",

        "text": "Now we all know that kids are *experts* at malicious compliance. This is not one of those stories. Today I got to watch my sister call her kid’s bluff. You might say he was being malicious and she tricked him into compliance.\n\nSo I was on the floor playing with my 2 and 4 year old nephews. Oldest was being very ornery and trying to control everything and mess up anything we tried to do without his permission. It took all my auntie skills to not let him get away with this while keeping it light hearted and fun. \n\nEventually he’s occupying himself with legos while I and the youngest put on an animal parade. But he schemes to put a stop to this too. He decides he needs more legos - and simply *must* walk through the animal parade to get them. Intent on maximum subversive destruction he pushes the animals all over the place in the process. That’s it for me, I’ve had it, and I say very sternly, “Hey! That was NOT nice!”\n\nHe looks at his mom and says “But I was just walking.” I was steamed but his mom was brilliant. Instead of arguing with her 4 year old and causing a melt down she said very casually and with a cheery voice, “Oh! Okay! Than it was an accident and when that happens you just have to make sure you put them back where they were!”\n\nHe was so relieved that she “believed” his lame excuse that he had no problem complying with the rule she’s just imposed that if he accidentally made a mess he should clean it up. He quickly cleaned it up and next time he needed more legos made a big show about tiptoeing around the animals. \n\nHe was visibly relieved he’d gotten away with it and didn’t get in trouble BUT still learned his behavior has consequences. I bow down to her parenting skills!\n\nSIDE NOTE\n\nLast time I played animals with the youngest we had a big standoff when it came time to clean them up. He simply refused and all my auntie skills failed to get him to comply. The best I could do was shove some toys into his hand, hold them there myself, and physically move his arm to drop them in the box while praising his big brother for being such a good helper.\n\nI had completely forgotten about that incident until he decided tonight he was done playing animals and wanted to play legos. I didn’t realize we were done playing with the animals until he suddenly said “I’ll help you clean up Titi!” He wanted me to know he was going to be a good boy, unlike last time. Warmed my heart. :)\n\n",

That year though, they decided that this was priority number 1. They would say it was for student's safety (their reasons being you could hide a gun or knife). There was a logic to it, but it was very overcautious. I would bring my backpack in everyday mostly for the convenience. I would frequently find myself late or almost late to a clads because i had to go to my locker than to the next class. Using my backpack helped, but the school wasn't having it. A teacher and the vice principal told me I could not bring in a backpack.\n\nHere's the thing, during this time I noticed how some girls would bring in huge satchels to class. One was even the same size as my backpack. I askes about this, and was told those were purses. I asked why that was acceptable, since they were the same size, and the answer was again that they qualified as purses.\n\nSo I then I realized how I could comply. My dad had an old satchel he doesn't use, and funnily it was smaller than that gargantuan \"purse\". I bring it in the next day, and the look on the vice principals face was priceless. I explain that I was using a purse, and saying I wasn't would be sexist, since that would mean girls could do it but not guys. So for the rest of the semester I got to bring my satchel in, and nobody could stop me.",

I asked him if he could do the actual spit part because I'd just had breakfast, so he did it and we got on with the rest of the procedure.\n\nThe two people in front of us, however, were having a little difficulty. Neither of them wanted to spit in the dish for whatever reason. They were arguing back and forth before one of them (Let's call him A) turned to me and said:\n\nA: \"Hey, you need to do this, we can't do it\"\n\nMe: \"Nah, I really don't think that's a good idea. I just-\"\n\nA: \"No, seriously, you have it do it. If I have to spit in this dish I'm gonna throw up\"\n\nMe: \"Well, if you insist...\"\n\nI spat in the dish and, what do you know, it was coffee brown and still had a few bits of tuna floating around in there. Yes, they asked the professor for another dish. No, he didn't give them one. Yes, they had to use it for the rest of the class.\n\n",

        "text": "TL/DR: Worked with a jerk who tried to count everything we did as writers, piece by piece.\n\nMost of my career involved writing, and I often worked in departments that had several other writers, but usually everyone was good at what they did. \n\nIn one setting some guy was hired who not only could not write well (by that, I mean competently, and efficiently), but was a suck-up jerk. He groomed his relationship with management to the point he became some sort of executive lapdog for one particular manager who was vulnerable to butt-kissing. This was fine initially, because we didn't have to edit or rewrite his horrible work. However, he took things to another level and got the manager to permit him to do some \"analysis\" on our \"productivity.\"  (The part about the keystrokes is coming; hang in there and you'll see it). \n\nOne of his stunts was to ask for detailed lists of exactly how we spent our time, down to the minute, and he provided weekly charts we had to fill in (by hand). Although our fairly small group churned out hundreds of original pieces of writing every month, it wasn't sufficient to block a chunk of time out for writing the XYZ report, we had to give more details (at that point, we did a collective \"Huh?\" and eye-roll). \n\nOkay, fine. We began entering things like. \"Thought about XYZ report: 30 minutes\" or \"Phoned so &amp; so about the XYZ report: 10 minutes,\" or \"Edited the edit of XYZ report: 15 minutes.\" \n\nAt some point, the idiot manager recognized it was a waste of time, so that ceased. You'd think he would have learned that anal bean-counting wasn't welcome, right? But nooooooo.\n\nWe then got a notice that he would be monitoring our keystrokes for every single document (via the word processing system). We tried to point out that someone who deletes by backstrokes vs highlighting and cutting would have a different count of keystrokes for the same basic number of characters, but that didn't sink in to him. We also pointed out that keystrokes don't really tell you anything in terms of productivity, since we wrote about anything from standard personnel-related actions to complicated engineering procedures. No luck.\n\nBy this time, we were fed up. Without even conferring about it, we all began using needless keystrokes in everything we wrote (such as inserting an underline with manual strokes, or adding a row of junk and deleting everything character-by-character). \n\nMy preferred method was to write out every date as, \"In the Year of Our Lord, Two-Thousand Nine and...\"   Sometimes I then deleted it, but sometimes I left it in. \n\nOnce again, his anal little project didn't last long. \n\n",

        "text": "Okay, I'm not 100% sure if this story should be on this sub or not. If the latter, please let me know and I'll post it where it should go.\n\nSo this story happens about 7 years ago, and at the time I was acting as a lab demonstrator (tutor/teacher/what have you) for the first year physics students. Now the general structure of these labs were that you had 3 hrs to do the experiments and write a report, which would be graded over the following week and returned at the start of the next lab session. So during the week, I get to marking these reports and two are very obviously carbon copies of one another, which I am meant to fail outright. However, being the jerk that I am, I decide to have some fun and I mark one as a distinction and the other as a pass. \n\nTo forestall any comments, yes I am being a bit of an jerk here - I am fully setting up what happens next. I also recognise how difficult it can be to do a full lab and then write a report in a 3hr block, I did the same course too. So usually when I see people who have copied off one another, but at least have gone to the effort of rewriting parts in their own words, I will lower both students grades by one tier and move on. These two had not bothered to even do that, and the reports were almost literal carbon copies of one another.\n\nFast forward a week and, as I suspected would happen, both the students come up to me and the one who obviously got the pass mark waves both lab books in my face and tells me \"that there has been a mistake\" and that \"our grades deserve to be the same\". Well, I had been waiting for that exact turn of phrase, so with a shit-eating grin I say \"of course, my mistake! Your grades certainly do deserve to be the same\" and with that, I cross out the distinction and remark it as a pass.\n\nNaturally, now, both students are pissed and decide to escalate the whole ordeal, and track down the topic coordinator and have a bitch to him about it. He took a look at both of their reports and promptly failed them both for that (previous) lab. They never copied off one another again in the labs I demonstrated.",

        "text": "I don't know if this is the most appropriate sub for this story, so let me know if it belongs elsewhere?\n\nI work security for a private business campus that has venues that are often rented by outside groups. One particularly large hall was rented by a local church group and we sold their tickets at the box office immediately in front of the venue. Without going into boring detail, there was only one way into the hall for the general public but numerous exits with cameras everywhere. Parking is free in all three of our parking decks, except in clearly marked reserved spaces, which will be important soon.\n\nWhile visitors were still arriving for the event, our dispatch center received a call from our largest campus tenant complaining that a car was parked in one of their 24/7 reserved spaces and they need it moved asap. This company pays for these spaces and is constantly using them at all hours of the day and on weekends, which is why we have numerous highly visible signage for this row of spaces warning people of this fact and that towing is enforced.\n\nWe reviewed camera footage and saw that the owner was a woman dressed in fine Sunday clothes that were an almost painful shade of lime green with a matching hat. This would have been enough to identify her even in our large hall, but we then noticed that she bypassed the ticket line and made her way to one of the venue exit doors. She stayed there several minutes and, when one of the cleaning staff exited, she slipped in behind them. (We're still not sure how she knew she could do this, btw.)\n\nAs the supervisor on duty, I entered the hall and found her in one of the front rows sitting in a group of people. She saw me coming in my security uniform and immediately scrunched up her face.\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, can I-\"\n\nHer, interrupting me: \"Now I juss sat down. What is it you want?\"\nShe was already on the defensive and loud.. Not a sign of innocence in my experience.\n\nMe: \"I'm with campus security and I need to ask-\"\n\nHer, cutting me off again: \"What you need to do is leave me alone. I'm sitting with my family and we're here to enjoy my nephew's concert. Ain't nothing so important you rent-a-cops need to be botherin' me like this.\"\n\nMe: \"Actually it is important. If you wouldn't mind coming with me, we can talk in the aisle and-\"\n\n(Note: she thinks I'm here because she didn't buy a ticket but I don't care about that. I'm trying to tell her about her car before we have to tow it. This is her only chance to move it herself.)\n\nHer: \"No, you ain't kicking me out of here at my own nephew's church concert.\"\nNow she starts avoiding eye contact with me.\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, I'm not here about how you got inside this hall, I'm-\"\n\nHer, raising her voice even more: \"I don't know what you're talking about but you NEED. TO LEAVE ME. THE HELL. ALONE.\"\n\nAt this point it was so comical that I remember getting the biggest smile on my face and telling her \"That's all I needed to hear. Enjoy your show.\"\n\nI left and had her car towed immediately. Two hours later she reported her car stolen to our security desk. The desk officer informed her that she parked in a reserved spot and that security had tried to make contact with her before the show began, according to our log. She loudly demanded to speak to whoever was in charge and that's when I came around the corner and introduced myself. The look on her face was priceless and she didn't say another word as I gave her the information for the tow company's lot, which was closed by that time.\n\nEdit 1: I omitted her physical appearance, other than her outfit, as it was wholly irrelevant to the story as it unfolded. Those of you making this a race or political issue are disappointing. This is purely a wholesome story about a garbage human doing garbage deeds and getting garbage results back in her garbage life.",

        "text": "x-post from r/ProRevenge because I was told this also belongs here:\n\nThrowaway because my family knows my main account.\n\nWarning: long post. This actually happened at Christmas last year but the effects are now being felt full force.\n\nMy older sister, let’s call her Ria, and our mom have always had a very difficult relationship ever since I could remember. Ria has always been headstrong and not afraid to ask questions. My mom was a very traditional devout Christian who put family above everything first. Bit of a background - my mom was the second eldest of 9 children and moved from the Philippines to the US. She grew up dirt poor in a small province and experienced first-hand the hardship that comes with taking care of a big family. She was the first of her family to graduate college and has always valued education as a means to get out of poverty. She has paid for 4 of her siblings to go to college (only 2 actually completed and went on to find jobs) and has also paid for several of her sibling’s children to go to good schools in the Philippines.\n\nRia had more exposure to the extended family than I did (she was born in the Philippines, I was born in US - 7 years apart). As she got older, she was very outspoken about how she did not agree with my mom financially supporting some of her family because Ria felt as though they were abusing my mom’s generosity, especially since mom was frugal with our expenditures here in the US.\n\nWhen Ria was in her last year of high school, she had a bad falling out with my mom and moved out. They did not speak for 5 years (although my dad &amp; I kept in touch with Ria). In that time, Ria worked full-time and paid her way thru college without any help from my parents at all. Fast forward a few years at my high school graduation, I invited Ria, she attended, and ended up reconciling with my mom. Things were still rocky but they had a much better relationship.\n\nTwo years ago, my mom passed away. Unknown to me at the time, Ria had quietly taken over the continued financial support for my mom’s youngest sister's (“Jana”) cost of living and maintaining the college fund for Jana’s daughter. She also took care of the funeral arrangements and handling the estate (dad was a mess at the time).\n\nLast year, Ria and I decided to spend the holidays in the Philippines. One of our visits was to Jana’s place. Little did I know that shit was about to hit the fan when we sat down for dinner. After small talk, the topic of my mom came up and this was how that conversation went - details may be lost in translation so just writing the gist. (R: Ria, J: Jana)\n\nJ: “Such a shame &lt;your mom&gt; passed away. We will miss her.”\n\nR: “Yes.”\n\nJ: “Ria, why did you stopped talking to her? Why did you leave her? You should be ashamed - that’s not how you treat family. Now, your mom could've raised you better - you always were too headstrong you know, that's not ladylike - you shouldn't be so aggressive. You need to be softer. How are you going to get a man otherwise? [... she goes on to say more shit along these lines]”\n\nR: “. . .”\n\nJ: - turns to me - “Don’t be like your sister ok? Be a good daughter. Do you have a boyfriend yet? You don’t want to get too old like Ria and not have your own family. That’s not following God’s plan!”\n\nBefore I could speak, Ria asked her own questions.\n\nR: “Why did you drop out and decide to get pregnant when mom was paying for your college? Did you really think that that businessman would leave his wife to take care of you? If you wanted to be a trophy wife, you should’ve just said so instead of wasting my mom’s hard-earned money.”\n\nAt this point, I just decided to watch because Jana was starting to piss me off and Ria has been known to do epic take-downs.\n\nJ: - enraged- “How dare you come into MY house, eat MY food, and disrespect ME!”\n\nR: -calmly- “Technically it’s my mom’s house, you have food because my mom has been supporting you for the better part of 15 years and you disrespected her by wasting all the opportunities she worked hard to give to you”\n\nJ: “I don’t NEED your attitude, or your bullshit, I don’t NEED anything from you - you disrespectful bitch. Get the hell out of my house [...more rant]!”\n\nR: -gets up and smiles- “You sure you don’t need ANYTHING from me. You don’t want ANYTHING from me. I want to confirm that I heard you correctly”\n\nJ: “I don’t need shit from you, I can take care of myself and MY family and how DARE you imply otherwise! Get the hell out of my house and your father will hear about this!!”\n\nR: -looks at me- “You heard her, let’s go.”\n\nNow, I was surprised by how calmly Ria was taking the diatribe because I’ve seen her and my mom get into massive shouting matches. More confused than anything, I followed her to the car.\n\nR: “You heard her right, she doesn’t need ANYTHING from me”\n\nMe: -it begins to dawn on me what my sister is about to do- “Yeaahhh…”\n\nR: “Ok.”\n\nWe get back to the hotel and my sister promptly stops the auto-transfer of funds for Jana’s account. We then spend the rest of the week lounging by the beach and hanging out with other cousins.\n\nYesterday, I was talking to one of my cousins and heard that Jana is just now realizing what actually happens when you run out of money. I called up Ria shortly after to give her an update.\n\nR: “What? She ran out of money that quick? There was enough in there to last her the year.”\n\nMe: “Oh. Did you tell her that?”\n\nR: “Eh, basic math.”\n\nMe: “Will she lose the house?”\n\nR: “Nah. It’s paid for. As long as she doesn’t do something stupid, she should have a roof over her head.”\n\nMe: “Did you also close her kid’s college fund?”\n\nR: “Nope. Not gonna punish the kid for her mom’s stupidity. But that’s all she gets so if she fucks it up, she fucks it up.”\n\nSo yeah, will definitely be interesting how this plays out in the next few months. I have a feeling my sister probably won’t give a damn one way or the other though.",

After a little bit of this, he basically told us to write it in the book, and we slowly went back to the old system, even if it was technically breaking the rules.",

Most of our boots sold through Cavender's, but a large portion were expensive, custom boots often costing $1,000+ per pair.\n\nThe station I worked was considered the toughest in the factory, and really should have been run by two people, but was only assigned to one person. It was expected of me to get 40 cases (6 pairs on each case, equaling 480 individual boots) through my station in 9.5 hours. That's barely a minute per boot, assuming you don't run into any setbacks, such as faults in the material.\n\nBut I ran into mistakes caused from pure laziness in almost every case. When brought to the manager, she told me to suck it up and just fix them. (rather than trying to get those ahead of me in the assembly line to stop making those mistakes) \"They need to get out quickly; we don't have time to fret over faults. Just fix the mistakes and keep the line moving quickly.\"\n\nYou want quantity over quality? I'll give it to you.\n\nWe just so happened to be working on a new line of boots for one of our biggest selling retailers (Cavender Boots), and the boots needed to be in perfect condition. Our deadline was approaching fast, as this was a rush order. The total case count was somewhere around the 30 case mark. That's about 180 pairs of boots.\n\nEvery boot that came through, I sent on without fixing mistakes. But the particular mistake that was coming through a lot was one that became irrepairable once it left my station. Quantity over quality is what she wanted, so quantity over quality is what she got.\n\nThe day after all those cases went through my station, and before anyone noticed the irreparable mistakes I allowed through, I quit with no notice. I went to the office on my lunch break and informed the plant manager that effective immediately, myself and 3 other coworkers were no longer employees of the factory.\n\nI later heard from someone who still works there that almost every boot in that order had to be recut, several thousand dollars worth of material had to be thrown out, and they almost lost their contract for the new line of boots. Malicious compliance never felt so good.\n\nTL;DR - Manager pushes unrealistic expectations, and I comply, resulting in the company losing several thousand dollars.\n\nEdit: changed the wording in one sentence.

        "text": "This happened almost 20 years ago but I just remembered it when watching A Series of Unfortunate Events Season 2 (The elevator episode.)\n\nI used to work in a hotel that was on a high-rise building downtown. It took up the top 15 floors and the bottom 12 floors were office buildings and a garage. So our lobby was on the 12th floor, people had to go up the elevator before they could officially enter the hotel and check-in. This elevator was also pretty old and there was almost a 2-inch wide gap between where it's doors closed and where our floor began. There were huge signs about \"minding the gap\" and it was outlined in red paint, but still a month didn't go by without someone getting their high heeled shoe in the hole and tripping/falling. (Seriously, that thing was a lawsuit waiting to happen, IDK how the hotel/building got away with not fixing it.) Anyway this all becomes relevant soon:\n\nThis couple and their toddler had apparently already been rude and problematic during check-in time so the front desk staff and concierge staff was already \"up to here\" with them. During my shift they came down to the lobby floor and the mother was complaining about something-or-other to one of my coworkers who just looked dead-in-the-eyes at this point, while the husband stood there and watched them. Their toddler had the keys of their rental car, which was attached to a lariat. He kept swinging it around and throwing it. He finally managed to hit himself in the face with it, fell on his butt and started crying. I rushed over to him to see if he was okay and took the keys from the carpet.\n\nAt this point, the mother turned around and all she saw was her kid on the floor crying and me with the keys in my hand so she made some immediate assumptions in the form of \"How DAAAREE YOUUUU take away anything from my child? I'm his mother! Not you! Give him back the keys this instant!\" Her husband (who had rushed over and knelt beside the kid at this point) and other witnesses told her what really happened but she was already in that 'Mama bear' + 'Admitting wrongness is a sign of weakness' mindzone so she just kept insisting I give the keys back to the toddler. Just SCREAMING. Red faced.\n\nMy immediate thought when seeing the kid with the keys was that he's drop it down the shaft, so I looked at the dad, who seemed like the more reasonable one, and said something like \"Okay but be careful of the gap in front of the elevator.\" The toddler, who had stop crying by this point and was just watching his mom have a tantrum and had forgotten about the keys, but the dad got pissy at my warning and said \"Just give it to him already!\" in that tone some people use when talking to idiots.\n\nWell... you guys can imagine what happened next. The kid got up, started swinging the keys around, I walked away. (so unfortunately I missed the best part) The mom got whatever she wanted from my coworker that she was yelling at and then they went to the elevators to wait.\n\nWill you believe, according to my coworkers, the kid squatted down and dropped the keys down the elevator shaft gap ON PURPOSE???\n\nThe mom started losing her shit. We could hear her screaming all the way from the back office. The manager went out to try to calm her down and see what was happening and apparently she told him that I instructed her toddler to throw it down the shaft LOL\n\nI don't know if it qualifies as 'malicious compliance' exactly because If I wanted to keep my job and avoid drama, I had no choice but to comply. (I suppose, I could have tried to hand it to the dad and hope he didn't do the condescending 'no, I want you to hand it to the toddler' thing??) But I think for this sub it's close enough?",

        "text": "I have 5000ish users. They're mainly fine. There are a couple of potatoes, but you expect that. The people that really bother me, are the users that think they know better than you. Our Service Desk is 4 people, and all calls are recorded, and then used in complaints handling, appraisals and training.\n\n\nTake Angry Cretin ($AC), for example. This guy told us many times how he used to work in IT (he now works in Finance) When Wannacry hit last year, he rang and offered his services, and then got annoyed when I politely declined because nothing was infected. He often asks us for domain admin rights, and says we need to utilise his knowledge and ability more.\n\n\nAngry Cretin has recently been promoted to a grade higher than I am (I run the Service Desk and Desktop teams, or tier 1+2 as they're also known). This meant he felt he could treat me and my team like dirt. He stopped greeting people and saying goodbye on the phone, and even talked over someone who was greeting him and announcing themselves. He ordered a laptop 2 working days ago. He ordered it on Wednesday. Today is Friday.\n\n\nHe rang the Service Desk ($SDesk) to enquire about its progress and was told it had been delivered today, but would require setting up, and this would take a couple of days as we had a backlog.\n\n\nThe laptop was actually on build. It was being built over SCCM and was around 15% of the way through. The post built setup was a couple of applications and then AV and encryption. About half a day's work. It would have likely been ready by the end of the day.\n\n\nAngry Cretin then rings me ($Me).\n\n\n$Me: IT, rocknrollnobody speaking.\n\n$AC: Service Desk tell me my laptop is here.\n\n$Me: Hi AC, yes that's correct.\n\n$AC: I need it urgently. I'll come and get it now Ok?\n\n$Me: It's not ready yet. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until it's finished imaging.\n\n$AC: Whatever. I know you're just deliberately holding it up on purpose.\n\n&lt;Hangs up&gt;\n\n\nI went through to my Service Desk (really good team) and tell them that $AC is to be told his laptop is not ready until someone calls him and says so.\n\n\nLiterally 15minutes later\n\n\n$SDesk: Hello, IT Service Desk\n\n$AC: Is it ready now? Can I get it?\n\n$SDesk: Hi there $AC, I'm afraid your laptop is still building.\n\n$AC: Rubbish. I know you guys are slacking off. I know how long it takes to build a laptop, I've done hundreds. I used to work in IT. I'm coming to get it.\n\n$SDesk: It's still building, so is not in a usable state right now.\n\n$AC: I'm coming over. Whatever state it's in, just give it to me. I'll build it myself if I need to.\n\n&lt;Hangs up&gt;\n\n\nService Desk come to relay this to me. To which I ask what they think. This kid really has his head screwed on well, and will go far in our industry. He says\n\n\"He said he wants it in whatever state it's in, so I say we give it.\"\n\nI agree. We pull the power and network cable out the laptop, whilst it's at 45% build on the SCCM, bag up the laptop, and as he appears at the department door, it is handed to him without a word. $AC makes the comment,\n\n\"See? That wasn't so hard now was it? Next time, don't make me pull rank on you\"\n\n\nHe leaves. An hour later I get a call from my boss ($Boss)\n\n$Boss: Hey, $AC tells me you refused to give him a laptop, and then sabotaged it when he did get it.\n\n$Me: Interesting. What else did he say?\n\n$Boss: That $SDesk was rude and unprofessional. What's going on?\n\n\nI played back our recordings of the calls, and explain that we merely complied with his request to give him the laptop regardless of its state. $Boss laughs.\n\n\nLaptop was returned to us this afternoon by $AC's colleague, who was really lovely. I emailed $AC to inform them that we're now working on tasks that cannot be interrupted, and as such, we'd sort his laptop at some point next week.\n\n\nIf he'd just left us to it, then we'd have his laptop ready by the end of the day, but no. He had to be a massive cock-goblin instead.",

        "text": "Excuse formatting due to mobile phone. First timer here, and tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nIn the army, we perform Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) on our vehicles and equipment to find and fix issues before they become serious problems. A full PMCS is detailed in a Technical Manual (TM) which can be around a thousand pages (the actual PMCS part can be up to 200 ish pages) depending on the equipment. The TM is the in-depth literature that explains operation, maintenance, stowage, and general specifications and accounts for every single nut and bolt of the equipment.\n\nTo properly do a PMCS, the soldier will go line by line in the TM and perform the step written. If he finds something wrong, he will write it down on the log sheet used to track all deficiencies. There are two types. Faults, which are little items that don't necessarily affect the operation of the vehicle but should still get fixed eventually before they become major issues. Some faults will never become a major issue due to what they are. Deadlines are the other type, they're exactly what they sound like, a major issue that should prevent the vehicle from being operated for one reason or another. If you have a deadline, your vehicle isn't supposed to be dispatched, and you shouldn't be operating it until all deadlines are fixed.\nBuuuut for the sake of time and just making sure our vehicles are still combat operational, we will only hit the major items (fluids, head and tail lights, motor operations, no major leaks, etc.) to keep everything running and make sure that we can still effectively do our jobs. We don't bother with all of the little faults that we know the mechanics won't fix because they're just little things that don't hinder us doing our jobs. For example in my vehicle, the glass on one of our headlights is cracked, but the light still works just fine and there's no water in it or anything... the mechanics won't fix it because there's no need so we don't bother writing it down. \n\nYesterday afternoon, the senior officer of maintenance (let's call him \"Chief\") for the entire battalion walked through, inspected our vehicles and our sheets that we write deficiencies on. He, along with several other higher ups, noticed that we weren't writing down the little things and proceeded to chew us all out because we weren't doing our jobs and the vehicles weren't being fixed and such and blah blah blah.... So they told us to do a thorough, by the book PMCS today and log all deficiencies.\n\nRoger that, chief.\n\nHere's the problem... we're a heavy unit. We have tanks. We have armored personal carriers. We have self propelled fucking artillery and reconnaissance vehicles. PMCSing takes a long damn time. Our TMs are long as hell and our lists of deficiences are even longer. We spent all this morning doing maintenance and checking every little thing to write down on forms that they didnt give us. What happens when a vehicle has too many faults? Can't dispatch. What happens when a vehicle has one deadline? Can't dispatch. I ride shotgun in a tracked vehicle. The engine bay fire sensor has been a problem since I showed up over a year ago AND THEY STILL LET US OPERATE. So, when chief said log all deficiencies... he basically told us to render our unit combat ineffective. Soon we're going to get chewed out for being combat ineffective. And when our chain of command asks why we can't fight, we will point the finger back at them and say \"You. You told us to...\"\n\nOh by the way, we go into the field in three days and they want us to try to really start \"fixing\" our stuff now. Don't worry, it still works effectively, and all you folks back home are still safe. Just the army bureaucracy at work.\n\nTL;DR: chain of command said to log every single problem with vehicles which makes us combat ineffective. Waiting for them to get mad at us for being combat ineffective. \n\nEdit: log sheet for my vehicle is a page and half long... which is ridiculous. ",

They are impossible to understand by themselves and we don't get very in-depth training.\n\nMy supervisor wanted me to fill out a form for a case that I have never seen before and knew nothing about. When I asked for assistance, she said that I should just read the instructions and go with it. The instructions were written by someone 50 years ago who barely understood the process themselves. So I try and I send it to her. She sends it back with a note that says \"this is wrong, please correct and return.\"\n\nAgain, I ask nicely, I don't understand the form, what is wrong and what needs to be fixed? Again she said to read the instructions and figure it out. I'm good with figuring most things out. Most of what I have learned in this job is by digging up old manuals on how to do stuff. This form, however... ugh. It is a mess.\n\nAfter the third try, I stopped even trying to figure it out and just started changing numbers one by one and sending it back. This is lots of work for her because she has to make an official note every time she gets this form and has to send it back. 11 tries and she finally comes in to show me how to fill out the form. \n\nTurns out, I was correct the first time I filled it out and she had been looking at the wrong case.",
