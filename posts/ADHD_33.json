I don’t know if im just that lazy/ unfocused that 72mg concerta can’t even get me to do stuff but idk",

It wasn’t that big of a shock for me, since I always kind of had a hunch that I might have ADHD. \nAfter receiving this information, I wasn’t that interested into knowing much about ADHD, I kind of shrugged it off tbh. I think I did that bc all my life I heard about ADHD as “just a concentration problem”. Until my psychiatrist told me it’s much more than that. \n\nSo now, being in treatment for BPD for a few months, I’ve been doing extensive research about ADHD, and holy fuck.. I understand myself so much better now!!! \nI was specifically mind blown about the neuroscience behind ADHD. \nIt helped me not only understand my ADHD, but also how it affects my BPD and vice versa.",

Just looking to see if anyone else has experienced similar side effects with Concerta and curious if anyone has made a similar switch.\n\nFirst off, I do enjoy the extended release aspect as the positive effects extend past the work day and into my personal life.  Which is certainly nice.  My double dose of Adderall had a similar effect but slightly less pronounced and remembering to take the second dose was sometimes difficult.  I would say that the Concerta has more of an effect on keeping me up but I would describe it more as a lack of tiredness rather than an inability to fall asleep, if that makes any sense.\n\nWhen I take Concerta the next hour or so it feels like I've taken something, which I didn't really experience with Adderall.  I would describe it like a headiness which I'm not a huge fan of.  Not a wonderful way to start a morning.  Also, without fail (sorry if this is tmi), I'll have a bowel movement but then still feel the need to go afterwards.\n\nA few things that it may be impacting negatively but I am unsure of are sexual performance and feelings of discouragement or sadness.  I will need more time to determine if these actually  related or just happened to change around the time that I switched medications.\n\nIf anyone has any insight or similar experiences, I would love to hear them!",

They commentate their own lives and it's constant, it's so overwhelming for me. \"Oh I need to get my phone to check the recipe- where's my phone oh! it's on the side. yes yes get the recipe, oh no which app was it? No it wasn't hello fresh it was a gousto recipe because yes yes I remember- okay! gousto app gousto app, where is it I can't find it oh that's the one perfect yes okay recipe, recipe recipe okay! found it okay kitchen time need to get my ingredients-\" all of them do this about everything they do. They're not even talking to have conversations, it's like they'll explode if they don't get the words out. It's quite hurtful because they don't actually talk with me very much, they're always speaking but never listening to anything I say. I'm autistic as well and I get overwhelmed very easily from lots of sound, so when my safe space where I go to decompress is so loud all the time it makes things so difficult. I know I sound frustrated because I'm tired of being so overwhelmed at home but I genuinely would like some advice on how to deal with this, whether it's something they can do or something I can to get better about dealing with it.",

She asked if I clench my teeth and I was like no because when she asked that I just thought of clenching my teeth when I sleep and well idk if I do that because well I’m asleep.

Well it turns out that I cracked my tooth mainly because I clench my mouth so fucking hard all the time. When I told my dentist this she said “your teeth are not supposed to touch except for when you’re eating” and well that was the end of me. I have not been able to get that phrase out of my head and I cannot stop noticing if/when my teeth are touching causing me to just open my mouth as wide as I can anytime/anywhere. Which I suppose is not the end of the world and I am happy that I know this information but I just wish this wasn’t constantly on my mind.\nI guess I’m just annoyed that my mind can’t just let it go, but is this also my brain trying to train my body to perhaps not clench my teeth and maybe once I’ve gotten it down it will leave my mind and I’ll just be doing it automatically? \nDoes this happen to anyone else? Once you’re aware of something (especially negative) you can’t let it go?",

(No disrespect to church goers, it was just torture for my brain, just like school every day all day.) I found a way to \"get through\" it by banking up daydream topics, so as soon as that 20+ minute sermon started, I eagerly let my mind drift off to more engaging things that I was saving up in my head to think about uninterrupted. I sometimes felt guilty that I wasn't paying attention, but I didn't really connect with the sermons anyways, which became more and more true as I got older. \n\nI don't go to church anymore as an adult, and my daily life isn't so routine, so I don't really have a need to save up daydream topics. I was just wondering if it was unique to me.",

The pharmacist mentioned it could have been due to the timing of the refill, mentioning that insurance will sometimes not allow the lower rate if filled under 30 days &amp; I foolishly went along with it, paid and left. Then this week I went to pick up my prescription and the price is still over $130. I called my insurance and they said the \"cost allowed\" to charge was increased to the price I'm currently being charged. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? There was no notice/communication of it changing, my insurance has not changed, and the pharmacist was even surprised at such a jump. The woman from insurance basically said it is what it is, try a goodrx coupon and have a good one. From what I've found online, the coupons do help drop the price a bit, but its still about 2-3x the typical amount.\n\nIts frustrating enough having the shortage, but now to be suddenly hit with the price hike is a bit much.

I’ve never been medicated, and I’m often overwhelmed with doing everyday tasks like showering or chores. I’m about to start college soon, and I want to know what I should do to improve my life. I’m thinking about asking the counselors at my college since my family can’t afford therapy. I don’t know if a counselor can give me medication or help me in any way but I’m going to try anyway because I’m tired and I’m afraid that I won’t be able to handle college and dropout. I feel a lot of pressure to succeed and my parents would be upset with me if I drop out or don’t do anything with my degree. My family supports me but they only think that therapy is only needed if you are very mentally ill, like having paranoid schizophrenia. I wonder if my life would improve a lot if I start medication.I want to be able to balance studying, and having a social life. I feel very lonely and isolated. I’ve always lived like a hermit, barely talking to anyone, and having little to no social media presence. I was diagnosed with ADHD mixed type around kindergarten to first grade and my mind feels cluttered and disorganized. I want to have a successful career in IT because I like programming and computers, but I don’t think I can handle a corporate career without medication. I have conflicting feelings of wanting to have a successful career and buying a camper and being an aimless nomad. I feel overwhelmed with my thoughts and social/family pressure to succeed. Thank you for reading. I feel like this whole post is word salad but I just wanted to get some of my thoughts out, and I need advice.",

My doctor prescribed Nootropil 800 mg (Piracetam) twice a day at first, but it wasn't available in the market. So, I went back to my doctor, and he prescribed Venlaxor 37.5 mg instead of Straterra, which he said was our last resort due to its potential side effects.\n\nHowever, after doing some research online, I found out that Venlaxor actually has more side effects than Straterra, and is usually prescribed for patients who don't respond well to first and second-line medications.\n\nI'm feeling a bit confused and concerned about the medication choices. Has anyone else had a similar experience with this ADHD medication? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI've been looking for information on this subject but can never find something that is applicable to me, as it is usually on exercise and short acting stimulants with strategies you cant do on extended release/long acting meds.\n\nSo I've been using lisdexamfetamine (extended release) for about a month now. I found that my heart rate is elevated about 10-20 bpm in rest, and approximately 20+ bpm when exercising. My commute consists of a 12,5 km cycling distance which i love doing, but i noticed that while on stims my HR was close to the %max for about 75% of the time! Naturally, this doesnt happen with no meds. My therapist doesnt exactly know how bad this could be so I have been looking around for info. I dont think it is good for you to have such a high HR for prolonged periods of time, so I tone down the pace so my HR is lower.\n\nHowever, while also trying to train for endurance, i dont know how to go about training with heart rate zones anymore. Zone 2 (50-60% of max) is reached when I am walking at a leasurely pace. Cycling at a pace that is infuriatingly slow for me brings my HR in zone 3 which is considered a dead zone.\n\nInfo websites say you shouldnt exercise on stimulants or exercise before taking the meds or after they have run their course. XR lasts about 13 hours for me and considering the work commute twice a day, not an option for me. So my questions are the following:\n\n- is exercise truly a bad idea while using stimulants (and under their effects?)\n- are heart rate zones still indicative of exertion? The heart still has to do the work so the effect on the body is there, i guess?\n- your experience with this issue?\n\nIt is truly worrying me if i am doing something dangerous and/or if i am no longer able to train endurance :(",

In the past I've had short episodes of depression, but by taking proper care of myself (sports, diet etc.) I was able to get over those by myself within a couple of days. Lately, I've noticed that my episodes of depression are getting longer, the \"deep\" bit still takes as long as before, but it takes me way longer to fully bounce back to normal (multiple weeks). Therefore I'm currently in the process of trying to switch to a different medication. (and yes, I am, and have been doing therapy as well.....) My doctor said that after I've tried methylphenidate there isn't really a standard order in which I have to test things out, other than that most people try dexamphetamine first. Therefore he's willing to take my wishes into account as there is no medical reason why I would or wouldn't choose a certain one. I'm curious to hear what your experiences are with the different medications. Based on some googling I'm mainly curious to hear about dexamphetamine (Tentin) atomoxetine (Strattera) lisdexamphetamine (Elvanse) and guanfacine (Intuniv).   \nI wanna hear both good (how it helped and felt etc.) and the bad (side effects, cost (especially if you live in the Netherlands like me) etc.)",

Its debilitating, its anxiety, its self doubt, its impulsive behaviour that’s self destructive but we do it anyway. Its something i wish I didn’t have. It makes me avoid putting any effort into things i love because id rather pretend it means nothing to me for fear id fail. I feel alone in a room full of people. I second guess my every move. I know my potential but im scared to go for it because failure seems worse than the comfort i get from not even trying. I hyper focus.. but not in a good way. Its always on what other people think, on how im not doing well enough, always on everything im doing wrong. Im my own worst enemy. And sure i cant sit still, i can’t focus. But its so much more than that. I feel like a stranger in my own skin because the person i know i could/should be is a person i always ignore. ADHD isnt fun. Its a mental prison where hyper fixation always ends up being the negative. I still think of things that have happened to me years ago and let them bother me endlessly whether i want them to or not. adhd is lonely. Its putting on a mask in social settings to adapt to how you think you should be. At the end of the day, adhd is chaos. Its trying to unscramble a messy mind just to function. It feels like i have no control over where it goes, thinking like a hurricane. But i smile and ignore the chaos on the inside, to seem ok on the outside.",

While it's a relief to know that there's a reason why I've been acting strangely all my life, it's also made me feel like my entire life has been a lie.\n\nI've had a hard time maintaining relationships, both with girlfriends and friends. But in November 2022, I met an amazing girl who has stuck by my side and taken the time to learn about my differences compared to \"normal\" people.\n\nI've been taking medication for ADHD for over 7-8 months now. I started with Vyvanse, then switched to Foquest, which was the worst idea ever. Now, I'm back on Vyvanse and while my head is still all over the place, it's a bit more controlled.\n\nHowever, the medication has also brought some unexpected side effects. I've seen and imagined some really messed up things, especially when I was taking Foquest, to the point where suicide came to my mind a few times. I've never been majorly depressed before, but recently, it's been hitting me hard. Just knowing that I'll be stuck in my own mind my entire life is a tough pill to swallow.\n\nTo make matters worse, I'm used to getting dumped by friends and girls, which only adds to this whole thing. I feel like a creep and a weirdo, and it's hard to shake that feeling.\n\nOn top of all this, I'm a workaholic. I work 12-15 hours a day on average, and a day without work makes me feel useless and worthless. I'm a business owner (woodworker) and a communication technician.\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest and share my story with others who might be going through something similar. If anyone has any advice or just wants to chat, I'm here.\n\nThanks for listening.",

I've been taking Vyvanse for around 6 months and for the most part it's been great, the slow release throughout the day seems to work for me.\n\nRecently though I've been finding myself procrastinating in the evenings, to the point where it sometimes feels uncontrollable. This behaviour manifests itself mostly in gaming, particularly like Slay the Spire or Civ on my Steam Deck. I'll start playing and I'll not be able to stop until I'm so tired I conk out. Turning off the game in the middle of a run feels impossible. This means that I'm going to bed later (I can't sleep in because I have a kid), so I'm feeling more and more tired during the days which it making me less efficient, which in turn drives my depression and anxiety.\n\nBefore Vyvanse I had a 3 month period where I managed to leave my phone downstairs, go to bed at 10:30pm and read a book. It was great. I want to find a way to try and get back to that behaviour.\n\nIt can also show in eating as well. Vyvanse has really suppressed my appetite during the day (which I'm not complaining about), but sometimes in the evenings I can be binge eat. I can stand in the kitchen at midnight glued to a youtube video and just eat and eat something without really thinking about it.\n\nHas anyone else experiences this? Anyone know of any good ways to break this cycle?",

Whatever the case, there is a boom in ADHD tech solutions, from online drug deliveries to web sites and apps. [...] Now there is a Sidekick, who's pitch is that it's a \"productivity browser.\" Today it's launching a host of features geared to ADHD sufferers and the attention distracted more generally. The company claims users with ADHD noticed a \"significant improvement\" after using the browser. The Chromium-based browser was founded by Dmitry Pushkarev (a Stanford PhD in Molecular Biology, ex-Amazon exec and ADHDer). \n\nSo how does it work? To nullify distractions, the browser incorporates AdBlock 2.0; a Focus Mode Timer disables all sounds, badges and notifications for a selected time or indefinitely; a Task Manager organizes your day; and there's a built-in Pomodoro timer; it also claims to run 3x faster than Chrome, which, apparently, is important for ADHD sufferers. Suffice it to say, it has a number of other distraction-killing features; however, I'm not going to list them all here. \n\nCEO and founder Dmitry Pushkarev said, in a statement, \"Modern browsers are not designed for work, but for consuming web pages. This gap really hurts hundreds of millions of users. We are convinced that lowering web distraction reduces anxiety and increases the quality of people's work and the quality of their lives.\" He says the startup plans to make money via corporate subscribers, who will pay to get their ADHD-afflicted workers into a more productive mode.",

I know I should be proud of myself for getting this far, even if I'm behind my peers, but I can't figure out how to actually be happy with who I am.\n\nI think all this forgetting things, being messy, time-blindness, paralysis, impulsivity..., and the reactions these things triggered on the poeple around me during all my life, have shaped me into a person who feels that will never be enough, no matter how hard I'm trying.\n\nIt's like, now I know that my brain works differently and I'm not just \"lazy\" or \"dumb\" but my subconscious is unable to process it. I'll start with therapy soon, see if I can do something about it. But I just reaally need to know if there's more people who have gone/are going through this and if it gets better.",

Whenever I buy the bag, though, it lasts maybe two days.\n\nFor my partner, I ration out his candy because he has the same problem. He likes gummy candy, and I don't, so it works out perfectly; I give him one portion per day. Problem is, he can't do the same for me, because he also likes candy bars and will just eat the stash that he's supposed to feed me.

I could be doing a few simple tasks such as buttering some toast and putting the lid back on a container when someone could ask me for something and I’m instantly annoyed/frustrated/overstimulated. When in a conversation with someone, I constantly interrupt them by blurting out my thoughts so I don’t forget. I procrastinate with everything so bad to the point that I owe thousands in an ezpass bill because I one ticket I couldn’t take the time to call about. I am INCREDIBLY forgetful, I could walk downstairs for something and within seconds have no idea why I went downstairs or forget a thought mid conversation. I also am known as the worst texter in the world to the people I know because I’ll read their text and forget to reply. I start tasks while I am in the middle of doing something which I believe is why cooking is so hard for me. I’ll be cutting an onion and walk over to get a paper towel then see dishes in the sink so I finish those quick but then suddenly remember I was cutting the onion and on my way back to do that, I get distracted with the over flowing garbage, and then forget I had biscuits in the oven. \nI am also often irritable, impulsive, have awful sleep patterns, unmotivated, abuse substances (alcohol and the green), indecisive, scatterbrained, I could go on and on and on.\nI need medication because I can’t handle these symptoms on my own anymore. It like I’m constantly at war with myself. They also make me seem stupid, irresponsible, lazy and incompetent which makes me feel awful about myself.",

Any advice?\n\n(I do this with my other hobbies too; I abandon books that I 've bought in total excitement, I stop my knitting projects after progressing a bit, if I 'm not completely satisfied by the progress, I bought running shoes, went to run once and it started raining so now I 'm waiting for the perfect conditions to go out, but even then I have an excuse.
