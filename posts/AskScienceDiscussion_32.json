I don't quite understand why this is, but that's my recollection at least.\n\nIs this a known phenomenon?

I am going to do a Homo Sapien, obviously, but want to do five or so others.

Which are our five most important ancestors? Preferably that we have good fossil records of (I don't just want to print a bit of a finger bone!). If there's a \"dead end\" (like, I believe, Neanderthals may have been...), that's fine too.\n\nIf it's impossible to narrow down to 5, then I am happy to do 6. :)\n\nI'm planning on doing a lot of reading about them as I print them.

Most of the time your food will be scavenged pre-apocalyptic supplies or gathered from land in the early stages of being reclaimed by nature. Pre-packaged foods would most likely be spoiled by bacteria, if not half eaten by rats/cockroaches. The wilderness would have things that are hardy and durable rather than easily edible. So you would have brambles rather than berries and insects, lizards, and rats rather than deer or even rabbits. I'm thinking a carnivore-style digestive system would be helpful to sanitize your food but a short digestive tract means you wouldn't be able to benefit from eating the plant materials (aka tree bark) which may sometimes be the only thing available.           \n\nNow our wanderer of course also occasionally happens upon permanent settlements, and can stock up some supplies for their journey. The usual habit for humans is to carry grain, but the kind of grain worth carrying requires water and heat to be made edible, which might be inconvenient in the wasteland. Fats have the highest energy to mass ratio, so I'm thinking a digestive system capable of eating spoiled fats might be the best which leads back to a carnivore-style digestive system. However, this would make grain a non-option entirely, which also seems inconvenient.     \n\nThe best I can come up with is a digestive system that needs to work with spoiled meat/fat as well as tree bark. Using that as a starting point, what changes would you need to make to a human digestive system to make those processes more efficient?",

Following are various eruption phenomena.  How dangerous are they, particularly considering the likelihood of occurrence?\n\n1. Fumes from a) fissures b) lava entering ocean [laze] or c) slowly creeping front moving into forest land. Fumes incapacitate people vs. just irritate them.\n\n2. Steam cloud from lava flow hit by heavy rain: Sean King death.  (Some consider this a one-off event.).

Fountain suddenly expands, engulfing people nearby in lava.\n\n4. Lava river suddenly overtops the channel, engulfing people nearby in lava.  (In 1950 an eruption above Kona, Hawaii, reached the ocean in only 3 hours.  Very steep terrain, dangerous channel flow.  The terrain at the current lava river is much more gradual.)\n\n5. The myriad of dangers at the flow front entering the ocean, including laze.\n\n6. Hikers falling in cracks near fissure sites, e.g. terrain at Leilani Estates.\n\n7. Dangers related to walking on hardened lava:  Newly formed shelf dropping into ocean; collapsing lava tubes.\n\n8.  Finally, the phenomenon of \"lava bombs,\"  lava projected by a fissure that strikes anywhere within a circumference of 3/4 mile, or more.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-injured-hawaii-lava-bomb-says-he-could-have-been-n876631\n\nThis item has drawn much discussion: Is this something that happens primarily in the early stages of a fissure development, before an established fountain or flow?   Or might it happen now with our long-running Fissure 8, with its lava fountain? Could Fissure 8 suddenly start throwing out rocks in a 2-mile circumference, say?\n\n*Some have argued the safest place for a viewing site is the middle river (equal distance from Fissure 8 and ocean).*\n\n - - - -\n\nETA:  [Map eruption area](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=19.48101134011797%2C-154.88404450722487&amp;z=14&amp;mid=11tCiLa42FId7GMtg-4UkEoAI9QozTVFD)\n\n - - - -\n\nSanctioned lava viewing, Iceland, 2010.  http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/04/04/iceland.volcano.tourism/index.html\n\n\n\n  ",

Even in Tegmark’s extreme multiverse scheme, his chosen criterion is mathematical consistency. It might be objected that these terms are narrow\nand chauvinistic – indeed, just the sort of criteria to be expected from mathematical physicists. Other ways of categorizing universes are conceivable, and could lead to even\nlarger concepts of multiverse than Tegmark’s. Examples might be the set of all possible artistic structures, or morally good systems, or mental states. There may be criteria for categorization that lie completely beyond the scope of human comprehension.\"\n\nHe says that there are higher sets of multiverses than Tegmark's mathematical hypothetical multiverses (like, for example the set of all mental states being universes.)\n\nBut he does not specify anything else. \n\nSo does anyone here know the particular theory/hypothesis that defends these kind of universes?\n\n",

For the sake of this question, I'm going to pretend that we have an ample supply of Anti-matter (500 kg) and we can also safely store it in a huge protected chamber.\n\nSo... what can we do with it? As far as I know, we can't do anything with it except mix it with matter and watch it explode. I see all these claims about how it's going to propel us into the future and send us out into outer space, but we can't even use the energy from nuclear power to do anything more than boil water with its radiation, can we? If the only thing we can do with nuclear power is convert water into steam to turn turbines to produce electricity, then how would we utilize anti-matter?\n\nI suppose my real question is: What's the end game for Anti-matter? Electricity is the end game for nuclear power, but electricity isn't that special. Well, it does some cool things, but it has very serious limits. Electricity can carry signals and turn motors, but isn't it completely useless when it comes to traveling through space? It can't turn a motor against a vacuum to produce forward motion so having electricity as your end game must not be the answer... so could we do anything else with anti-matter? Can we utilize it's awesome energy and harness it in any way? Could anti-matter itself be the end game? Doesn't Star Trek use the entire explosion itself as a form of energy that is then used to do work? Sort of like a power plant multiplied by an astronomical number?\n\nWhen I think of stuff like this, it makes me think that we're centuries if not millennia away from having manned space travel within our own solar system, let alone out into interstellar space.

Scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what’s happened since then?

This universe is finite, its resources, finite… if life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correcting.\"  \n\nTo do so, he collects the infinity stones, powerful artifacts that grand him many powers and abilities, one of which is the power to erase half of all life in the universe with the snap of a finger. A commonly heard criticism to Thanos' reasoning however is, why didn't he just create more resources.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nDespite its name though, it is never revealed that the power the infinity gauntlet (a gauntlet that holds all infinity stones) gives its wielder is actually infinite. All we know is that it has the power to turn half of all life in the universe into dust.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nLooking at nuclear power, it is clear that, at least in that field, destruction is much easier than creation. The process of splitting atoms, fission, versus the process of combining atoms, fusion. Could it be argued that something which would have the power to destroy life, doesn't necessarily have the power to create new resources for that life, since creation requires more power than destruction?",
