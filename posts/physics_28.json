        "text": "Okay, I am complete layman and just read some brief history of time. Anyway.\n\nI wonder why gravitation is considered the force to be pulling? Why can it not be other efficient way around and something like the space is just pushing you into the place occupied by a large object of mass.\n\nFor further explanation: if I imagine space I image just \"empty space\". But what if it is not empty and actually filled with something we can not observe. Unobservable water for example. In space there is a perfect equilibrium of this matter. But once you put a big rock (or a star) in this usually perfect sea, the unobservable water is pushed to the sides and -like water crushing a balloon of air under the sea- pushes from all sides to fill the occupied space by the mass object. \n\nSo well, it pushes you into the object. The object itself doesn't pull, but you are beeimg, in the direction the unobservable water flows, pushed into the mass. \n\nWhy is this idea wrong? :D",

In contrast I am focusing on the phase velocity of the signal. On the one hand the signal is composed of two tones, that can move at different phase velocities because \\[(*Ï‰c*â€‹âˆ’Î”*Ï‰)/*(*kc*â€‹âˆ’Î”*k*)\\] and  \\[(*Ï‰c*â€‹+Î”*Ï‰)/*(*kc*â€‹+Î”*k*)\\] can be different. However the phase velocity of the signal is equal to the phase velocity of the carrier frequency (*Ï‰c/kc*).\n\nBut if we try to obtain the phase velocity expression for a general signal, mathematics get much more complicated:\n\nA more general signal could be defined as:\n\n *s*(*x*,*t*)=âˆ‘â€‹ *Ai \\** â€‹cos(*Ï‰i* â€‹*t* âˆ’ *ki* â€‹*x*)  \n\n Applying trigonometrics:\n\n *s*(*x*,*t*) = envelope(*x*,*t*)â€‹â€‹ \\* cos\\[ *Ï‰c*â€‹ *t* âˆ’ *kc*â€‹ *x* âˆ’ *Ï†*(*x*,*t*) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n *Ï†*(*x*,*t*) = arctan \\[ ( âˆ’âˆ‘ *Ai \\** â€‹sin( Î”*Ï‰i*â€‹ *t* âˆ’ Î”*ki* â€‹*x*)â€‹ / ( âˆ‘ *Ai*â€‹ \\* cos( Î”*Ï‰i* â€‹*t* âˆ’ Î”*ki* â€‹*x*) \\]  \n   \nIn this latter case, given the complexity of the carrier phase, it is not simple to derive the phase velocity (or the phase at which i.e. the zeroes of the signal propagate). \n\nI havenÂ´t found in literature a general expression to derive the phase velocity of a signal. Does anyone knows how to obtain a more universal expression for the phase velocity?\n\n(This [link](https://electroagenda.com/en/phase-velocity-waves-and-signals/) provides the equations in a more readable way)",

I ran into an issue with them breaking though. I asked my chemistry teacher who told me to ask my physics teacher who said there was no real way to make a formula without a few test points. I have two test points now, 0.7mm in diameter and 0.9. I am planning to buy a thicker graphite rod that's 3 mm in diameter. Can I do logarithmic regression on the maximum effect on the two thinner ones and assume that's the maximum effect on my thicker one?",

        "text": " Greg Yang is a mathematician and AI researcher at Microsoft Research who for the past several years has done incredibly original theoretical work in the understanding of large artificial neural networks. Greg received his bachelors in mathematics from Harvard University in 2018 and while there won the Hoopes prize for best undergraduate thesis. He also received an Honorable Mention for the Morgan Prize for Outstanding Research in Mathematics by an Undergraduate Student in 2018 and was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians in 2019.\n\nIn this episode, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name \"Tensor Programs\" and currently spans five highly technical papers. The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT. We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks.\n\nNote: Random Matrix Theory has its origins in atomic physics. They were introduced by Wigner as a way of circumventing the specifics of a complicated Hamiltonian: can one instead get an understanding of the spectrum by instead considering a random Hermitian operator?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/immtamr613aa1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b25d75c88e41d1c69b3dd6cccdf26b45e69cbe8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rth96qh813aa1.png?width=3325&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fdd5eda54a506487ee79cb4cbe31074ffd1543a\n\nYoutube: [https://youtu.be/1aXOXHA7Jcw](https://youtu.be/1aXOXHA7Jcw)\n\nApple Podcasts: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cartesian-cafe/id1637353704](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cartesian-cafe/id1637353704)\n\nSpotify: [https://open.spotify.com/show/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG](https://open.spotify.com/show/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG)\n\nRSS: [https://feed.podbean.com/cartesiancafe/feed.xml](https://feed.podbean.com/cartesiancafe/feed.xml)",

        "text": "Hi, I'm planning a game inspired by nuclear fusion,  and as is the course when doing so, I have to make sacrifices in physical accuracy to enable more interesting game play. \n\nIn that regard, as part of the course of game play, I want to allow players to increase the strength of the weak interaction as it relates to diproton Î²+ decay into deuterium, as that seems to be the primary limiting factor in the proton chain of nuclear fusion. \n\nMy (extremely limited) understanding of QFT leads me to believe that the relatively high rest mass of the weak gauge bosons limits virtual W+ bosons greatly in duration, position, and velocity, which limits the rate at which weak interactions occur. Is this the primary reason that the weak interaction is so limited?\n\nIf the W+ boson had less rest mass, would the diproton have a higher chance to decay to deuterium?  Would other Î²+ decay happen on a shorter time scale?  Would this have an effect on the stability of particles, e.g. by reducing the number of stable isotopes? Would it lower the energy scale where electroweak unification occurs (I have no idea the ramifications of unification, but I want to avoid it to retain more simplicity)\n\nLessening the rest mass of the W+ would in turn reduce the masses of the W- and Z0 bosons, correct? Regardless, if the Z0 boson had less rest mass, would this increase the chances of interaction between neutrinos and hadrons? \n\nTo what degree would these effects occur?  If the rest mass of these particles were lowered to (near) zero, would the three particles become unified with the photon at STP? Would there be other consequences of having such lightweight weak bosons?\n\nThanks in advance. If most/all of this makes no sense under the standard model/QFT I'd love to do some reading to help better understand how to pose these kinds of questions.",
