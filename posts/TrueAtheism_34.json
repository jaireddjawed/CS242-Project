It doesn't have very much we would find useful today (i.e. germ theory of disease, scientific principles, mathematics) and doesn't have anything that a person of that time couldn't write. If you're an omniscient being and your purpose is to guide humanity with a wise document, this hardly qualifies. \n\nTheist (Catholic) Response I got:  As to a god who gives us everything we want and need to know about him and the world he created......wouldn't that be nice.  Simple, easy, everyone would believe, life would be grand, or would it?  If this god also gave us the free-will  to make choices, how long would it be before someone decided he had a better way of doing something?  How long would it be before someone decided that he wanted things a little different, more to his or her own liking?  And if he didn't give us the freedom to choose we would all act and live as puppets. Which would you rather have? Give some thought to a creator who gives his creatures the freedom to choose.\n\nMe to you Fellow Atheists: Do you guys have any advice here for me as I formulate a response?\n\n\n",

Also that the term separation of church and state was a phrase coined by Thomas Jefferson and has since been repeatedly used in the supreme court. My opinion is that, separation of church and state is a backwards delusion. Everyone in congress, (on paper) adheres to some sort of religion. What else do we know? That some states make you swear on a bible which is basically a religious test clause if you ask me. And also that its career suicide if you choose to come out as an atheist in political office. I wonder why? (caution speculation ahead) Is it because political funding would immediately take a hit? Is the freedom to practice any religion, simultaneously stunting the freedom to practice secular morality? I don't know, but it doesn't seem like the two 'ideas' (religious morality and secular morality) can stand next to one another, hand in hand, equal in weight. I'm not saying we throw out anyone who strongly disagrees but maybe start training our kids early in schools, secular morality and its advantages. ",

        "text": "Sorry for the long post, but I have nobody else to really talk with about this and need advice. My mother has been an evangelical Christian for about ten years now, but about two years ago quit her job to go to \"bible college\". I am not a Christian but I fall towards the agnostic spectrum of Atheism, and religion doesn't play much of a role in my life. I grew up in a community that is heavily evangelical but this was never a huge issue growing up.  I no longer live at home but am only a few hours away.\n\nAfter my mother went to this school for about two years I had never talked with her much about it.  While visiting home she wanted me to go with her to services at the school, and while she knows I have no interest in Christianity it was around her birthday I figured it would be an opportunity to see what she has quit her career of thirty years to do. I quickly realized this was no ordinary service but a several day \"Healing School\" conference and I was lucky enough to see the final night. Growing up I had regularly gone to an evangelical mega-church until I was around 13 and thought I had seen the extreme end of evangelism, but this was a new level. People talking in tongues, people attempting to get out of wheelchairs, cancers being \"cured\" everywhere and I was honestly at a loss for words. To top it off I was in the first row for the two hour event.\n\nWhile the event was bizarre it was my mother's behavior that still bothers me. She kept trying to get me to donate or put her money in the bucket, which I refused. She also told me she will live to be 110 years old because of her faith in Jesus, which was slightly ironic considering one of her classmates unfortunately just passed away who was in their 70s.\n\nPart way through the event she slipped me a note that said my cat had died. Strange timing to tell somebody their pet had died is an understatement, especially since she had been my companion for 7 years and had no known health issues. I threw the note away and tried to keep it out of my mind, but I was in more shock than anything. After the event I dropped her off at home and spent the night at a friends. \n\nThe next morning I walked into her house and saw my cat run across the floor and immediately questioned my sanity. She told me the cat had died but was brought back to life by Jesus last night. She also told me that if I believed in Jesus it would be the only was to cure my Tourette's syndrome (which is a mild case) and understandably made me angry. How could she say something that has caused me ridicule and pain my entire life be so easily fixed? I told her to never talk with me about religion again, which she still does, and it would be better for everybody. Ever since we have not talked about the incident and I have stopped feeling safe at her house like I had. I have this fear, which is probably irrational, that she will have an Abraham and Isaac moment and kill me in my sleep because God said to. Do I just let it go? Do I talk to family members? Talking to her is like talking to a wall and I am legitimately nervous of her well being because of the lies this church has taught her. Frankly, I feel too close to the situation and am looking for an unbiased view my situation and to hear from anybody who has had a similar experience.",

        "text": "Let's presume a generation of parents agree to raise their newborn children in a Truman Show like fake-world bubble with no religion. Let's also presume that for this experiment they stay true to the premise and do not talk about any religion in this controlled world but do not stamp out any conversation about the possibilities of deities if the children start the discussion. They simply respond with neutral phrases. \n\nAll media and entertainment for the children is made strictly for the experiment and is also religion-free.\n\nThe outside world watches as the parents live out their natural lives without revealing the experiment to their children. Eventually no one born in the outside world is left. The bubble children are now the leaders inside and have no access to any teaching of current religions nor any such thought about real world beliefs have ever entered their minds.\n\nLeft to itself in perfectly controlled conditions generation after generation I believe the experiment will obviously result in an atheist majority, but, an occasional cult or actual religious movement will pop up now and again. Of course they will have nothing to do with actual religions and will have been made up from scratch. Though there could be similar tropes like resurrection, etc.\n\nSo, assuming religion in the real world keeps on chugging along, will this experiment have any effect on the perception of religion? Shouldn't a true believer expect their religion to find it's way miraculously into the bubble?\n\nSadly I say no one would denounce their religion even with access to all the results of this experiment. Surely this would prove that religion spreads through indoctrination and not through it's own momentum. \n\nEven with the existence of other religions in the World, no one wavers in their own belief. Only this Truman Show experiment, run on a world wide level, would ever wipe religion from the face of the Earth. And who knows if what came next would be any better.\n\nTime to start writing that dystopian novel.",

        "text": "Preface: I know this is a long post, but please take the time to read. I spent a lot of time writing it. Enjoy. \n\nFor pretty much as long as I can remember I have been an atheist. I remember transitioning into agnostic atheism at about 13. But I was having a really insightful conversation with some friends yesterday about free will vs determinism, monism vs dualism w.r.t. qualia. \n\nI am a staunch determinist and materialist. I believe that free will is a sensation and like all other sensations is just an emergent phenomenon from the motions of the quarks, atoms, cells, neurons, etc up through every layer of abstraction. I also happen to believe that consciousness is not nearly as big a deal as we tend to think it is, that consciousness is a sliding scale, and that a lot more things exhibit some degree of consciousness than what most people would say. \n\nFor example, I think that computers already have some degree of consciousness. I don't have evidence for this, but it is a strong intuition of mine. There is however evidence that a lot of our thoughts and choices can be reduced to a lookup table in the brain. Since computers do this too, (very well I might add), I think it's likely that they experience consciousness as well. I would guess deep blue is about as conscious as a cricket, which is to say, less than a human, but more than a rock. If you've read about Searle's Chinese Room, I think the opposite of him. \n\nWith this in mind, I think it would be arbitrary to stop the layers of abstraction at the human level. If human consciousness is an emergent property of neurons going about their business, then perhaps cities have emergent consciousnesses as a result of humans going about theirs. The same can be said going to planets, galaxies, and even the entire universe.\n\nAnd when we hit the top, the layer of abstraction that we cannot go beyond, where we are looking at the universe as a whole, the consciousness that exists as the emergent phenomenon of everything below it, that's god. \n\nI don't see god as a creator of the universe but as a property of it. This god does not exist to judge or condemn or even do. This god just exists. There is no need to pray to this god or any need to follow special rules that the god may have. There isn't a way to communicate with this god, and god is not thinking about us. I don't know what god is thinking about. I don't think it's even possible to know what god is thinking about. We are simply too far removed to jump that many layers of abstraction. It would be like trying to determine where someone wanted to go for dinner by looking at quarks and using quantum mechanical equations. \n\nSo what does this mean for me? I don't know. I think I will start saying that I am a theist, though I remain agnostic. I am a little torn on this though because I don't want to say that without giving people context. It is not the easiest thing to summarize and I wouldn't want to be misleading because I think this notion of god is different than what most people would consider. I am not going to become religious or spiritual because I don't think that that is useful for the kind of god I now believe in. I don't think anything is going to change for me, really. I have had a lot of these thoughts in my head for a while, but something just clicked yesterday. \n\nI'd really appreciate to hear some thoughts from other people. I'm not looking to debate or be proved wrong or anything. Just friendly discussion. I think my thoughts on consciousness are aligned pretty well with Douglas Hofstadter (though I believe he is an atheist). My friends told me that I should read some Spinoza. If anybody else has any suggested reading, please post! Thanks for reading! \n\n",

A typical internet atheist always seems to have a superiority complex, is always trying to belittle religion, always battling against religion etc. I know most of the religious stuff is misguided and outdated, but why don't people try to understand the misguided reasoning behind it. After all in their minds they believe they are doing the right thing, and they need help understanding. But many atheist just mock their ways, and feel superior themselves for doing it. \n \nReligious people are doing what they still believe to be good. Also not all of the religious traditions are bad. Let us take lent for example. It teaches you how to build character and renounce pleasures. This can often make you a better person, since pleasures in life can often be bad for yourself in the long run, or can cause emotional and other pain to others, so you have to know how to renounce them. Yet all a typical atheists does is to mock lent, instead of acknowledging that lent may not be such a bad thing and trying to find a more rational religion free way of building character. \n\nI want to be an atheist, not an asshole atheist...",

I claim  no proof of this - it's just my opinion.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to structure a study/poll that could tease out the numbers a bit better.\n\nThe atheist community comes from a variety of sources.  \n\n- Those born to atheist parents\n\n- Those born to theist parents who were non-practising\n\n- Those born to theist parents who were practising but left the faith as they grew to adulthood.\n\n\nThese seem to be the ones that are most easily measured.  \n\nBut how do you find the ones who are\n\n- in a theist home and afraid to speak out\n\n- in a theist marriage and afraid to speak out\n\n- children in whom religion didn't 'take' that are ripe for  losing their faith\n\n- those that go through the motions out of respect for their parents/spouses/in-laws\n\n- those who are afraid of losing their jobs/social network\n\nI'm sure there's lots more that I haven't mentioned.  \n\nI wonder what kind of numbers we would see if all those who really had no 'faith' - just went through the motions - were counted.  \n\nHow would we find these people and count them?  I bet if they could see that they represent a large group they might be more willing to 'come out'\n\nThere are other benefits to getting a better count as well.  Politicians would be more willing to 'woo' atheist voters or discuss secular issues if atheists were more widely represented numerically in the population. \n\n[Edit] It occurred to me that perhaps this has been done and I'm unaware.  I *am* aware of some recent studies showing increases in numbers of 'nones'.  In this post I'm focusing primarily on those who don't readily identify as atheists and how their numbers would impact the overall numbers.",

Likewise, I can't say that any other fanciful made-up idea is completely false either.  Ghosts, alien abductions, etc etc.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.  But I can't say for sure none of it exists.  The chances that stuff is real are so slim it's not even worth considering.  So for all intents and purposes I say I think they don't exist.  However it's illogical to conclude, without proof, that there are no gods.  \n\nIs there some cutoff for how much doubt you have of the probability of the existence of a god for atheism?  In order to identify as atheist do you have to take a stand on faith to say god can't possibly ever exist.  Or can you be like me, and include it in the list of things other people have made up that aren't true, but can't be proven to not be true?\n\nAm I a /TrueAtheist?      ",

        "text": "I will start with saying that I am someone who loves punishment enough that I debate creationists on the Internet at least once a week. I think it's important to understand their view point, and I'll happily say I've managed to loosen up a few people on the topic of science in a sea of mostly futile exchanges.\n\nMost conversations usually involve me trying to be Socratic followed by carefully explaining the basics of evolution, the scientific method, and how they don't have to abandon their God because they understand science. I drop a few links to pages like talk origins and we are done if all goes well.\n\nThis particular interlocutor I've run into now is more of an old earth ID proponent than a creationist, so explaining science to him and how evolution works merely gets a \"so what?\". We've ended up with the topic of morality and that's where we are stuck. My biggest problem is getting him to understand that morality doesn't HAVE to depend on a God.\n\nMy argument is that since Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and others all claim to have revealed truth, and that their god(s) are the primary source of good and morality, and we haven't established which religion is the ultimate truth, we can't rely on these religions as our sole source of morality.\nI continue by saying that we have inherited altruism through natural selection. We understand the basics of what is good as all social and complex creatures do. The more complex the creature, the more complex the social structure. We can try to build a moral framework based around this along with understanding suffering, well-being, and how to create a society with a measurable move towards one over the other.\n\nHis response to what I've been arguing follows along these lines:\n\nScience is the discovery of the laws of the universe and nuances of nature that are *already in place*.  Theology is the investigation of ontology of the universe and the existential questions within. \"Skeptics\" refuse to distinguish the two.\n\nAll skeptics and atheists point out moral problems without a shred of ontological basis, and we can't build a moral framework around mans opinion, only Gods. God alone makes the moral code, men are not worthy of judging him or saying what is \"good\". If God is not in charge, then anything is permissible, mans opinion is Hitler's opinion, Stalin's opinion, Anarchy, etc. what good says is good.\n\nFinally;  continuing to push the argument that \"because there exists more than one truth claim, ie. Christianity vs Islam, then we cannot know which is true\". This is foolishness in the extreme.   By that logic, we could never solve a crime because all of the suspects would claim innocence. You dont live this way so stop trying to apply it by special pleading.\n\n\nThat pretty much sums up his side and I've done mostly direct quotes here in trying to do him justice. He doesn't want to talk about which religion is true, just that it's obvious that Christianity is, end of story. Sam Harris and other atheist philosophers aren't real philosophers, and they are men so their opinions don't matter, so pretty much everything I have to say and cite for my sources is null to him.\n\nI would have been done with him by now, but he's made me out to be an immoral monster when all I want to do is have him understand that I personally see no good reason to believe in any gods, so why don't we think, question, and figure out a real moral framework. \"God is in charge, now shut up!\" Is not good enough for me.\n\nWhat do you think of this topic? Is there a valid morality and good without God?\n",

Shall we define the word \"inspire, inspired?'  Defining terms seems to be of help as we continue our conversation.\"\n\nSo my question for you all is - Is there some hidden meaning behind believing that the bible is \"inspired\" by god that I'm missing? \n\nMerriam-Webster has the definition as : to make (someone) want to do something : to give (someone) an idea about what to do or create\n\n: to cause (something) to happen or be created\n\n: to cause someone to have (a feeling or emotion)\n \n(#2) Next she asked me \"what facts are you willing to accept about the Bible?\" I suppose my answer is anything that's been proven to be historically accurate.

        "text": "About 8 or 9 years ago when I was still a Christian but not completely sure of my faith, my church (a college campus church where my roommates were members/staff, and I played in their worship band) had a weekly bible study. I was in around 18 or 19 at the time. I was questioning my faith, but still desperately searching for reasons to believe. The church had gotten some copies of a Focus on the Family series called The Truth Project, which was intended to be a tool to strengthen and reinforce the faith of young people in their belief in God. So my church decided to focus on that in our bible studies. If you're curious, [here is the promo for that series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ8ikrDisDU).\n\nIt's got lots of philosophy and general apologetics, but there is a  phrase which was repeated over and over again: \"Do I really believe that what I believe is really real?\" That's what stuck with me. It's what eventually pushed me over the edge into atheism. I became obsessed with ensuring that what I believe was true, so I started talking with people of other faiths and of no faith, and of course, eventually lost my faith in God.\n\nSo, about 4 years ago I made a friend who was a moderate Muslim. I didn't spend any time debating the points about Islam, mostly because I hadn't read the Koran or the Hadiths and couldn't specifically source my understanding of the religion. I simply lived with him (we were stationed together, and assigned to the same military barracks room), and showed that I was a good person through my actions and behavior. When he would eventually ask why I behaved morally and did good works as an atheist (or whenever he decided to engage me in religious discussion generally), I explained that one of my life's focuses was to discover what was true, and that it was what had lead me to my disbelief/humanism. We had multiple religious conversations over about a year, and I never personally attacked his beliefs. A few months after I moved to a different duty station back in the United States I got a facebook message from him, and he told me that he now considered himself an agnostic. He thanked me for explaining my viewpoint, and said that it was the biggest influence on his becoming non-theistic.\n\n**TL;DR**: Really, my point is that focusing on the finer points and minutia to disprove theistic claims is often not helpful, as attacking a specific point or belief just makes the person you're talking to become defensive. What really changes belief is focusing on the idea of making sure that what you believe is really true. If you point people in the direction of actually focusing on what they believe being actually true, then hopefully they will figure it out on their own. There have been studies that have shown that the more you attack a person's beliefs, the more they will become defensive and shut down any logic. So the best path comes down to focusing on the idea of discovering truth.",

I stayed in the warm embraces of college ministries never really asking too many questions because it was the teaching of Jesus that that steered me away from depression. But recently (after graduation) I suffered a crisis of faith when I began to see the disappointing similarities between peoples of all religions. Philosopher Peter Rollins, in an interview with comedian Pete Holmes, suggested some people need to lose their faith in order to see if it actually has any meaning in their life. So, I read The God Delusion and am now finishing up God is Not Great. Guys.. these books have kicked my ass. I thought I would never deny Christ, but now I don't even know if God is real. I imagine many of you have similar experiences and so I ask, how have you all dealt with this? Is there anything else you suggest I read to assure me that God is indeed fictional? Or does it take faith to be an atheist? I thought these books would only show me how ridiculous atheism is and strengthen my faith but they've done the opposite. I once despised quotes by Hitchens and wished he would just go away, but upon discovering his death I was brought to tears last night. Now I have to tell my family and church all this. I have no idea what I am supposed to say. I always assumed persecution could only come from non-believers.\n\ntldr; I was a Christian who read The God Delusion and God is Not Great and now don't know how to let go of the final strings holding me to the church. \n\nEDIT: everyone has been so helpful in answering my questions and even relating to what I said in general. At a point in my life when I feel lost and confused you've all given me an unexpected confidence and desire to move forward. Thank you all! :)",

The AFA is one of them, along with KKK and Black Panther chapters all around the country. \n\nNaturally, the AFA hates their status as a hate group and has given the SPLC a lot of heat, to which they do not respond. The AFA finally took action in an attempt to mock the SPLC by making this map, which is copied almost exactly from the SPLC, except it lists groups that they deem to be \"bigots\". \n\nhttp://www.donotlink.com/du7u\n\nFor those of you who don't know about the AFA, here is a bit of their history: \n\n• Claiming that gays started the Nazi party and are responsible for the holocaust (talk about blaming the victim)\n\n• Claiming that the constitution only protects Christians\n\n• Comparing homosexuality to bestiality, incest, rape, and murder\n\n• Attempting to pass laws that would exempt punishments for bullies who do it on religious grounds (in order to protect bullies who target gays, lesbians, and non-christians)\n\n• Responsible for Rick Santorum\n\n• Staunchly opposing the teaching of natural history in schools and universities to the point that they claim that evolutionists are knowingly carrying out Satan's wishes\n\n**NOTE:** I think it's important to note that the AFA has been confronted about each of these individual issues concerning their status as a hate group, and they have never retracted or apologized for any of these statements. \n\nThe hate map was found in their latest newsletter. It would be adorable if it weren't so alarmingly bigoted. \n\nIt's clearly retaliation for the SPLC's hate map, being that the map's style and verbage mimics SPLCs map almost exactly. \n\nThe AFA has long been a thorn in the side of all decency but sometimes they pull through and do things that are hilarious. \n\nI thought it would be useful to share this map for four reasons: (1) It would further spread the reputation of the AFA so that you know where your Chick Fil A dollars are going. (2) For a good laugh. (3) It makes for a good topic of discussion about the nature of religion. And (4) so that you can find local chapters of your fellow humanists, atheists, and \"homosexual agenda\" peeps. \n\n----------------\n\nEDIT: Added more details as requested by moderators. \n\nEDIT 2: I think we should take full advantage of this and start sending in our organizations for them to update on the map for our own convenience!\n",

And although I consider myself a Christian here in the South, I don't necessarily hold all the views of a \"Southern Baptist.\" I feel that whichever god or God a person believes in, whichever path gives them peace, that is theirs to follow. So this isn't me being biased and defending \"my God is the only God and I'm mad that the atheists of the world are harassing him!\"\nMy point here is, I don't see many atheists in the South get defensive over the justification of Apollo or Vishnu. Almost always they have researched the Bible and only really debate over the existence of God, leading me to believe that this form of atheism is not so much the \"absence of belief that deities exist\" but more so the absence of belief that the God that has wronged them exists. \n\n\n\nDiscussion?

        "text": "This is one part rant, one part asking for advice.\n\n-----------------\n\nRecently we gained a new employee -- the younger brother of a friend who is my age. So naturally, as the only person he knows, he's buddy-buddy with me in his new work environment. \n\nLately he's been asking to come over to my house, so he comes over and I'll teach him some stuff or we'll just play video games. Well last night I felt him trying to turn the conversation over to politics and religion. I tried to stop it but he launched into a monologue of (frankly) crazy conspiracy theories. \n\nBasically his worldview (without hyperbole, and using his own language) is that we are all God, and all conspiracies are true and explained by one unified theory, including the fact that the earth's magnetic pulse is changing which makes 1 earth day actually 16 hours but we have no way of knowing it, and that Lucifer and the fallen angels are Martians who destroyed Atlantis thousands of years ago, and they now spy on us from the dark side of the moon, and it all proves/corresponds with Christianity. \n\nThese are not ideas I am interested in discussing and he especially is not the type of person I want to have deep discussions with. \n\nBut what's worse than the far-fetched bullshit was his inability to have any kind of discourse. He doesn't really pause or take a break, so the only way to talk is to interrupt him, to which he will either speak louder, or let you ask a question and just ignore the question. \n\nI'm not kidding when I say he came over at 8:30pm yesterday and talked until 1:30 in the morning. The first hour I thought I would just let him talk it out, like maybe he was trying to open up to me or something? But then eventually I got annoyed with his methods of discourse and started to explain that talking with him about this topic is very frustrating and I don't want to talk any longer -- but he continued anyway. \n\nSo then I just tried to actually debate him. He usually ignored my questions but a few of them got to him, especially when I put Christianity in the form of a conspiracy. He talked about Satan for like 30 minutes about how he is the greatest deceiver, so I posed this hypothetical: In God's book, the OT, his biggest rule is to not have other Gods before him. It also says not to worship man. So what would Satan the great deceiver do in response? Perhaps make a gospel where people worship a man, and can only get to God through this man, and this New Testament would replace God's word, the OT. Isn't that the perfect conspiracy to drive people away from God? \n\nI could tell it shook him, because that's exactly the kind of conspiracy logic that he loves, but it goes against his religion. He got mad and kept ranting. \n\nI felt a bit bad about debating him, but when you overstay your welcome by several hours and don't listen to my request to change the topic, I think I'm entitled to ask a few fucking questions or have my own opinion. I got really annoyed and rather than just listening and holding my tongue, I would straight up call out his bullshit and even pulled up bible verses to argue against him. It really pissed him off. But jeez. \n\nHe has similar discourses in the office (although less intense) about the video game industry or marketing tactics, and he really doesn't listen to anyone. He's known as a know-it-all who doesn't listen. Even during break at work, I like to go hang out with my friend/coworker in the breakroom, and this kid will follow me in there (while he's still on the clock, mind you) and just take over the conversation with a long ass rant that lasts for my entire break. I don't know how I am going to deal with this asshole. I'm for sure not inviting him back to my house. \n\n--------------\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nMy friend's younger brother now works with me. He's very opinionated about his religion and politics and takes every opportunity to annoyingly rant about it, and allows nothing to interrupt him. He also wants to come to my house and hang out and start these discussions. \n\nI want them to end. What's a good way to deal with these rants when they arise? ",

        "text": "Not entirely sure this belongs on true atheism. \n\nI posted this in the comment section to a reddit topic regarding the morality of god punishing us for free will, and am curious what you all think.\n\n&gt;TL:DR - I don't believe free will exists, and my lack of free will has led me to the conclusion that god does not exist. If he does he is ambivalent or malevolent.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;It is my belief that free will does not exist. Every decision I have made can traced to genetic factors, instinctual factors, cultural influences, personal experiences etc.\n\n&gt;Even a mundane decision, such as which restaurant to eat at, the result of my decision can likely be found to have causation in some of these factors.\n\n&gt;It is my belief that all life is nothing more than biological machinery, and humans are nothing more than biological machines, who have developed the illusion of consciousness and free will. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is simply what we likely are.\n\n&gt;....\n\n&gt;Choice is thrown around too much these days.\n\n&gt;The choice of belief, For instance. I no more choose my belief than I choose the experiences that led me to the conclusion. Belief is just that, the conclusion to that which we experience and observe.\n\n&gt;Everything I have observed and experienced thus far in my life has led me to the conclusion that a deity likely does not exist.\n\n&gt;And that if a one did exist, they either do not care about us, or they are malicious. In which case why worship them, or pay them any heed.\n\n&gt;My sister being born with cerebral palsy, enough to shut down her motor functions, leaving her permanently in a wheel chair, unable to speach, or use her arms enough even to feed herself. But otherwise did not effect her mind (As far as I can tell). An otherwise capable mind trapped in a body that does not work with her, that stifles her intellect and ability to function. There are very few hells I can think of that would be worse than that.\n\n&gt;I have watched a happy optimistic child who loved the world despite this, to a deeply depressed adult, barely aware what is going on around her, crushed underneath harsh realities. There are times she doesn't even recognize me, and there are times I honestly believe she wishes to die.\n\n&gt;What sort of benevolent god, that cares about humanity would do that to an innocent child.\n\n&gt;My own bouts with depression, and anxiety that led me to hear the voice of god. In some ways this acts as a coping mechanism, and for a while this was for me, for a while. This voice soon became more angry and depreciating, eventually telling me to commit suicide. Later I learned that this voice I heard, that I called god was nothing more than the voice piece I used to express my desires of the world. When my views on the world and myself turned dark, so did it too.\n\n&gt;While I cannot make the claim all voices of god reside in the minds of the observer, my experience and what I know about psychology and neurology tells this is likely to be true.\n\n&gt;My studies into ancient mythologies, and comparative mythology especially , have led me to the same conclusion others have.\n\n&gt;That Monotheistic Judaism came about as a way for Kings and political powers to push for certain ideals. Yahweh was a Canaanite War god who grew in worship by the Ancient Israelite people, during a time when there was great tension and conflict in the regions surrounding Israel.\n\n&gt;And that is just Judaism, but along Judaism so comes all Abrahamic Faiths for they all claim to follow the god of Abraham. Does that mean that a deity didn't inspire the Canaanite Yahweh? Certainly not, but they never claimed to be an Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnibenevolent being, at least not in their original canon.\n\n&gt;I cannot logically claim no deity exists, but my experiences have lead me to believe that the question is irrelevant. I have seen no proof for god, but I have experienced reasons to believe that they do not exist but in the minds of man.\n\n&gt;The belief is not a choice, but the summation of observation and experience.\n\n&gt;If the Christian god really does exist I can only conclude that he doesn't want my worship, for why else would he give me those observations and experiences.\n\n&gt;Some apologists might say, \"But Satan is deceiving you to believe that god doesn't exist.\" Well then he has deceived me into believing that he doesn't exist either, for there is no evidence that Satan existed as the deceiver of all mankind, or lord of hell, within the Talmud or the Bible. Hell does not even exist in the bible. Both these ideas came out of the church as dogma much later, and were reflected in the translations and revisions made after.\n\n&gt;So if hell exists and Satan really is those things, and he is my deceiver, then if follows Yahweh is ambivalent or malicious in his allowing Satan to do so. Neither is a god worthy of my worship.\n\n&gt;I do not choose my beliefs, but I can choose whether to worship. But even this decision is based on moral conviction instilled into me through my experiences.\n\n&gt;I will stop here, for I fear continuing will lead to circular arguments of Satan and gods ambivalence and malevolence.\n\n\nIn response to this comment I got this response:\n\n&gt;Your entire comment is revolved around emotion. Innocent (If you want a completely grounded definition)simply means not guilty of something, or devoid of a crime. What makes you think, that simply because someone hasn't done anything, that they deserve anything?\n\nI wasn't exactly in the best of moods when I responded, and couldn't quite make out what they meant. 17 days and no rebbutal yet from the commentor. \n\n&gt;What are you yammering on about? My entire comment is that we are deterministic beings, and that belief in a deity is determined by observations and the experiences in one life. My observations and experiences have told me a deity doesn't exist or isn't likely to exist. Freewill doesnt exist, therefore it is beyond my control whether I believe or not.\n\n&gt; If a deity then chooses to punish me over my belief or lack there of they are ambivalent at best or malevolent at worse, for they are punishing one for forces beyond ones control.\n\n&gt;Edit: My apologies for my curtness, but you white wash my entire comment claiming it is something without citing or explaining why you believe to be so. At best i can determine you are referring to the section about my sisters suffering.I merely used it to determine an benevolent all powerful being can not exist, for such a being would not allow such things to happen. Maybe a logical fallacy, but it is just one part of a whole that has determined i reject the claims of the Christian god.\n\n&gt;If the Christian god did exist and he wanted my worship he should have intervened in the events that shaped who I am, and my opinion of him. The fact that he has not can only be interpreted by me as the act of a being who either does not exist, or does not truly desire my worship to which i have no sympathy.\n\n\nI will admit I at times speak with conviction that may not be founded by evidence. It is an issue I have, when I believe I am right I tend to speak of it as though it is fact. But if countered I am quick to admitting my misstep, and  more than open to reevaluating my beliefs.\n\nEdit: I felt the need to add the response I got and my rebuttal to it, as I felt it further helped explain my position.\n\nEdit 2: Fixing spelling.",

Has there ever been a greater honor delivered as a supposed insult?  However, his refusal to recognize his own atheism is an insult to atheists, and quite cowardly.\n\n(You can hear him speak about why he doesn't consider himself an atheist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos)\n\nHis disavowal of his atheism, and he is an atheist - as defined by every prominent self-described atheist (Dawkins, Krauss, Harris, et. al.) - is an attempt to separate himself from the \"baggage\" of Atheism.  Yet in doing the separation he is denying the atheist community of defining what it means to be an atheist, and tossing us onto the same heap of badness that Christians and other theists do.\n\nWhen deGrasse-Tyson denies being an atheist because he doesn't like how some atheists conduct themselves it is like a man who is only sexual active and attracted to other men denying he is a homosexual because he doesn't like rainbow flags.  Being an atheist isn't like following a football team.  You can stop being a Cleveland Browns fan because of the way the Dog Pound acts, but until you believe in god(s), you are an atheist.\n\nHis use of the word agnostic is another problem.  I know every time I explain what it means to be an atheist, and how it has nothing to do with agnosticism (and I am an agnostic too), deGrasse-Tyson's use of the word becomes a problem.  Yes he is an agnostic.  So am I.  So is Dawkins.  But he also does not believe in god(s), so he is an atheist.  We have enough trouble getting people in our own circles to understand this...we don't need one of the major science educators making it more difficult. \n\nIn the final analysis, his denial is an insult.  He is saying he is too good for us, and in doing so, he has lost my respect. ",

        "text": "I got into Reddit at a time when /r/atheism was a default subreddit.  I'd been an atheist for a few years before then.  But the sub consistently left a bad taste in my mouth, and it wasn't long before I unsubscribed.  From time to time I would check back, and read a bit more about their stated positions.  Over and over again, it made me want to just reach out and apologize to theists for the existence of atheists like this.\n\nOn a whim, I just did a search for \"Reddit atheism alternative\", and from that, just found this sub.\n\nI haven't read too much detail, but wow, this place is so very refreshing.  My perception of /r/atheism--and I fully realize it is way more complicated than this--is that the loudest people there are ones who were seriously hurt by religion.  As a result, they've got a degree of bitterness that shows through.\n\nI did not have a bad experience with religion.  My mother was a church organist.  As such, I went to church nearly every single Sunday until I was about 16.  I actually took the time to read The Bible cover to cover, and I even went back and reread more than half of it a few years later.  At around age 12 or 13, I had a severe philosophical dilemma that made me question my concept of Christianity.  It was a rather well-known passage from the book of Revelations(21:4): \"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" I thought to myself, \"is that really fair?  What if I want to feel sorrow or pain?\" In a nutshell, this caused me to question the age-old concept of Free Will.  This was followed up by classes in AP Biology, Intro to Philosophy, and History of Science and Technology.  And it lead me to the personal decision, that I don't need the concept of God to explain the universe around me; that science doesn't have all the answers, but that over and over again, it was just a matter of time before a system would be discovered that explained the way things worked without the need of an intervening omniscient omnipotent entity; that over and over again, it became an issue of \"God is in the Gaps\".  Having previously appreciated concepts like faith and trust in The Lord, I found that it all kind of falls apart when \"what realm The Lord controls\" is constantly shrinking.\n\nSo God was not for me.  But that never lead me to believe that God should not be for anyone.  My church was very loving.  They did not judge, they did not hate, they did not preach about sin and hellfire, they preached about love and forgiveness.  God or not, I'm a big fan of love and forgiveness!\n\nWhen someone talks to me expressing an interest in religion, I don't feel like it is my duty to point them in the only true way; to show them that religion is foolish.  I talk to them about what leads them to seek out religion, and try and figure out where their mindset is, based on their knowledge and experiences.  More often than not, I point them to the denomination I grew up with; because on so many things, they would so often be open-minded, non-judgmental, and happy to discuss.  And despite no longer agreeing with their conclusions, they seem to be happy, and nonviolent, and I honestly admire that.\n\nOn the other hand, if I talk to someone who is involved in religion and seems distressed as a result of it, I am quite happy to talk about, and potentially recommend, atheism or even agnosticism as possible alternatives.  I just don't think it is a magic bullet for everyone. And in the end, it really isn't all that important that everyone \"see the truth\".  If they are in the right state for it, then atheism can be liberating and wonderful.  If they are not, then theism can be a critically useful source of comfort.\n\nNo it isn't always peaceful. Yes, some religions come into conflict with other religions or philosophies. But that sort of conflict is going to happen any time any group tries to force any set of beliefs on another group without taking the time to patiently lead them to it naturally.\n\nPerhaps I digress.  My point is, I would look through the headings on /r/atheism and I would cringe.  I look through the posts here, and I don't.  And again, I just find that very refreshing.  So thanks, guys. Keep it up!\n\n(edit: Just copy-editing.)",

Here's my thoughts on the subject.\n\nThoughts for Beatles: Best selling band of all time, which in turn makes a lot of people rich. Have a huge fan base and songs are still listened to on a regular basis. Some songs were about love, some songs were about the traditional sex and drugs and rock n roll. The Beatles did inspire some bad things to happen, most tragic in my opinion is the inspiration to kill one of the members, not saying it's the Beatles fault directly, but they were a cause. Also brought a lot of joy into people's life and comfort. There existence did also cost a lot of money over the years to millions of peopole, which could have been spent in better ways. I like the Beatles, but their music could be seen as a distraction, even if you're listening to the Beatles while you are performing another task, you could be less focused on it, of course it could help you focus. Any others would be appreciated.\n\nJesus thoughts: Inspired the creation of the world's largest religion, existing 2,000 years after it's existence. Although now the average is probably going on Sunday for 2 hours, still a lot of focus, could perhaps be spent doing something more beneficial to society. Was also the promoter of having Sundays off, which could be seen as good or bad. Christianity was used as a means to control the people and did suppress many ideas, most notably Galileo, who's discoveries would have sparked more curiosity in the subject, which would have jump started the scientific revolution, and the world would probably be well over 30 years more developed by now, also the majority of the scientific discoveries have not been to other Mediterranean people, which could be seen as an aftershock. Crusades, inquisition, some holocaust undertones, also inspired a lot of men to keep fighting, no atheists in a foxhole, which could be seen as if we never had religion people may have been more reluctant to throw their lives away over something thinking it's the only life they'll get. Jesus has also brought comfort to all of those people suffering though as well, so they think it's not the end, which could mean that they are less focused on bettering their situation, and inginuity stagnates for 1000 years, which is kind of what the middle ages was, though not based solely on Jesus's shoulders, it's still pretty hefty. \n\nAnyway, I think it's a toss-up, id say Jesus probably has more Good total than the Beatles, but the Beatles have a lot less Bads, just because Jesus has been around a lot longer, but Beatles have a near perfect G/B record, whereas it could be argued Jesus has a near or less than 1 G/B record.

        "text": "  I have been thinking about this topic for some time now, and I thought this would be the ideal sub to get a critical, and ideally objective, opinion from. To start, I claim that all beliefs fall into one of the following three categories: atheism, theism or agnosticism. Atheism being the belief that there is not a higher power (at least not in the traditional sense, I assume some would argue that atheism pursues the highest power, science), theism being the belief in a higher power, and agnosticism, the abstaining of committing to a belief. Some grey areas I could foresee would be some eastern religions, such a Buddhism. For example, in an oversimplified representation, Buddhist believe in Dharma, the teaching of Buddha. While it is not as clear cut as theism VS. atheism, it seems evident that Buddhism is more strongly associated with theism. \n\n\n\n  Now, if granted that all belief systems fall into one of the aforementioned three categories, then my claim is that these categories are the only choices that have any relevance. To elaborate, it should not be a battle of any particular theist against any particular atheist. The pivotal choice that everyone must make, and the only choice that really matters, is choosing the parent category they will commit too. \n\n\n  So, I do not think that any theist should argue for a particular religion versus atheism. To argue that a religion has the sort of proof that an atheist values is an absurdity. What can someone with an old book teach someone who has an in depth understanding of the universe? What can they teach an atheist about truth that science cannot? In other words, to argue for religious beliefs based on factual merits is an oversight, and ill-fated effort. What matters in this argument is the search for Truth, and choosing whether or not science is an adequate tool to discern the Truths of the Universe. It is obvious, and supported by countless evidence that science has unraveled countless truths in the universe. However, all of these truths none-the-less rest on empirical evidence, which is as fallible as any other form of experience. So, can the Truth be found through empirical evidence alone, or is the Truth something transcendental that is entirely undetectable by science? If you can answer that question, then you are already committed to either atheism or theism. If you cannot, then you still belong in the agnostic pool, pondering which stance to take. \n\nEDIT: So, to reconcile with everyone, I would like to state that I'm not making a claim for any side (except maybe that one ought to take aside, even if they don't know that their side is right). It sounds to me that most of you feel similarly, that whether one believes in god or not, that they still ought accept the likely hood that such a belief can never be disproven or proven. \n\nMy question isn't about God or no God. My question is truly about science versus metaphysics, and whether science is worthy of the praise it has been given. Our understanding of everything is necessarily connected to our perception of the world, and that perception is fallible. Nothing guarantees that our perception is truth.This goes back to Descartes, Kant, Schopenhauer, and other great philosophers. Kant fathered the idea of transcendental idealism, that what our perception is grounded in a subject-based reality, but that it does not contain the anything as it is in itself. Consequently, there is only a few things he postulated we can know, such as 2+2=4, because he said that nothing in the idea of contains the numbers 2 and 2. It is created a new concept out of nothing, and making four without ever having to experience it. This sort of knowledge and anything like it would be true knowledge, since it is not grounded in experience. Why can't religion be a way to see things that are real, but not perceivable. I'm not even saying it has to be a God, just is there something more to the universe than science? Is it real? How can we know it? \n\nIf science has a limit, what is sciences worthy predecessor that we should believe in? I see the underlying argument at the bottom of atheism versus theism to be based on knowledge versus metaphysics. I'm not saying any one religion has it figured out, that would simply be absurd. I can't help but imagine that not any one belief system even has a fraction of the universe discerned... However, I can't help but wonder if a means for understanding things that are bigger than our perception of the world exists. \n\nIt may not be as implicit as I thought, but if atheist don't believe in a higher power that we cannot perceive, then they must belief in the power of what they can perceive. I would say this power is science, and that is what great atheist of our time have found solitude in, site one Stephen Hawking. Nothing to nock science, but the world was flat once, and science supported that. Now, as for what to believe in? I don't even have a clue as to where to begin.... ",

        "text": "Growing up as a Christian, I always thought that God had given Moses a perfect set of laws to govern His people. In truth, though, I'd never sat down and really looked at them from that perspective. Are they really the comprehensive guide to morality that they're claimed to be? They're listed right there in [Exodus, chapters 20-24,](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20-24&amp;version=NASB) and I've paraphrased them below.\n\nThe Ten Commandments:\n\n* Don't have any other gods before Yahweh.\n* Don't make an idol, *or a likeness of anything in the sky, on the ground or in the water.* Don't worship or serve such things.\n* Don't misuse the name of Yahweh.\n* Don't do any work on the seventh day of each week, because God rested on the seventh day of the first week.\n* Honor your parents.\n* Don't commit murder.\n* Don't commit adultery.\n* Don't steal.\n* Don't make false testimony against your neighbor.\n* Don't even think about wanting to take your neighbor’s house, wife, servant, animals, or anything else that belongs to him.\n\nThe rest, in order:\n\n* Don't make other gods besides Yahweh, or gods of silver or gold.\n* Make an earthen altar for Yahweh, and sacrifice sheep and oxen on it. If you make an altar out of stones, don't use cut stones, because tools defile the altar. And don't go up to the altar using steps, otherwise someone might look up and see your genitals.\n* If you buy a male Hebrew as a slave, set him free on the seventh year. If he came to you with a wife, let him leave with her, but if you *gave* him a wife, and she had children, keep the woman and the children and set him free alone. If he decides to stay with them, pierce his ear to show that he's your slave forever.\n* If you buy a Hebrew girl from her father as a slave, don't free her in the seventh year as you would a man. If she doesn't please you, you can let her father buy her back, but you can't sell her to foreigners because that wouldn't be fair to her. If you give her to your son, treat her like one of your daughters. If you take another woman, don't reduce the food, clothes, or sexual intercourse that you give the first one. If you do, you have to let her go free.\n* Anyone who sneaks up on a man and strikes him and kills him must be put to death. If he didn't sneak up on the man, but God still let him kill the man, the killer can flee to a designated city of refuge.\n* Anyone who strikes his father or mother must die.\n* Anyone who kidnaps a man must die.\n* Anyone who curses his father or mother must die.\n* If you strike a man but he doesn't die and can walk around outside with a cane, you only have to compensate him for his lost time and take care of him while he heals.\n* If you strike your slave and they die, you must be punished, unless they live for a day or two before they die; the slave is your property.\n* If while fighting with another man you strike a pregnant woman and make her gives birth prematurely, but neither the mother or child are hurt, you must pay her husband whatever he and the judges demand. If the mother or child *are* injured, then you must pay \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\"\n* If you strike your slave and destroy one of his eyes or teeth, you must let him go free.\n* If your ox gores someone to death, it must be stoned to death and not eaten, but you will not be punished. But if the you had already been warned that the ox had a \"habit of goring\" but you didn't pen it up, then you must die too. If the victim's family demands a ransom, you must pay them whatever they demand to redeem your life. If the ox gores a slave, though, just pay the owner 30 silver shekels and stone the ox.\n* If you uncover a pit, or dig a pit and don't cover it, and someone's animal falls into it and dies, you must buy the dead animal from the owner.\n* If your ox kills someone else's ox, you must sell your ox and split both the profit and the dead ox between you.If one man’s ox hurts another’s so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally; and also they shall divide the dead ox. If you knew, though, that your ox had a \"habit of goring\" and didn't pen it up, you must trade the live ox for the dead one.\n* If you steals an ox or a sheep and slaughter it or sell it, you must pay five oxen for an ox, or four sheep for a sheep.\n* If you catch a thief breaking in and strike and kill him, the thief's guilt is paid. But if he survives until sunrise, he has to compensate you for what he stole. If whatever he stole is found alive with him, he must pay double. If he has nothing, sell him as a slave and take the profit as your compensation.\n* If you let your animal overgraze your land, then let it graze on another man's land, you must pay him back with the best from your own land.\n* If you start a fire which spreads to thorn bushes, then burns up stacked or standing grain or a field of grain, you must make restitution.\n* If you give your neighbor money or goods to keep for you and it's stolen from his house, if the thief is caught, he must pay double. If the thief is not caught, then the owner of the house must appear before the judges, to determine whether he stole your property. Every item for which one of you says \"This is it,\" goes before the judges; whichever of you the judges condemn must pay double to his neighbor.\n* If you give your neighbor any animal to keep for you, and it dies, is hurt or runs off, and he swears before the Lord that he did not steal it; and you accept that, he does not have to make restitution. But if it was actually stolen, he must make restitution, unless he can show that it was all torn to pieces.\n* If you borrow an animal from your neighbor and it is injured or dies while its owner isn't with it, you must make full restitution, but if its owner is with it, or it was hired, you must only pay for the hire.\n* If you have sex with a girl who isn't engaged, you must pay her father the dowry for a virgin, and she'll be your wife. If her father absolutely refuses to let you marry her, you must still pay him the dowry.\n* Kill any woman who practices witchcraft.\n* Kill anyone who has sex with an animal.\n* Completely destroy anyone who sacrifices to any other god but Yahweh.\n* Do not mistreat strangers.\n* Do not mistreat widows or orphans. If they cry out to Yahweh, He will kill you and make *your* wives widows and your children orphans.\n* If you lend money to other Hebrews, don't charge them interest.\n* If you take someone's cloak as collateral, return it to him before sunset. Otherwise, what will he sleep in?\n* Do not curse Yahweh or your rulers.\n* Don't delay making offerings from your harvest and your vineyards. Make an offering of your firstborn son, the firstborn of your oxen and the firstborn of your sheep. Leave it with its mother seven days; then on the eighth day give it to Yahweh.\n* Don't eat any flesh torn to pieces in the field; instead throw it to the dogs.\n* Don't make false testimony.\n* Don't join with someone evil to make hurtful statements.\n* Don't follow the mob and do evil.\n* Don't lie in a dispute to go along with the crowd.\n* Don't be biased toward the underdog in a dispute either.\n* If you find your enemy’s ox or his donkey straying, return it to him.\n* If you see your enemy's  donkey stuck under a load, help him release it.\n* Don't pervert the justice due to a needy brother in his dispute.\n* Don't make a false charge.\n* Don't kill the innocent or the righteous.\n* Don't take a bribe.\n* Don't mistreat a stranger.\n* Plant your land for six years, but let it lie fallow on the seventh year, so that needy Hebrews can eat. Whatever they leave, animals can eat. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.\n* Do your work in the first six days of each week, but on the seventh day don't work.\n* Don't mention the name of any other god but Yahweh.\n* Celebrate a feast to Yahweh three times a year. Observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread by eating unleavened bread for seven days in the month Abib. Observe the Feast of the Harvest by eating of the first fruits of your field. Observe the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year when you make the last harvest.\n* Don't not offer sacrificial blood with leavened bread.\n* Don't leave fat from the offering lying around until morning.\n* Bring to best first fruits of your soil to Yahweh's temple.\n* Don't boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.\n* Yahweh will send a guardian angel to you. Listen to him, do not rebel against him, do not disobey him. He will not tolerate it.\n* Do not worship other nation's gods, or serve them, or follow their customs.\n* Serve Yahweh and He will bless your bread and water, and eliminate sickness, miscarriages, infertility and untimely death.\n\nIt's obvious that they're cobbled together from previous oral or written traditions, complete with duplicates. How do people convince themselves that this is straight from the mouth of God?\n\nThe same way I did, I suppose--by never thinking about it.\n\nThanks for reading.

        "text": "Last semester, I came across a term used from the 18th century to the 20th century called Positivism and how it became the catalyst that divided science and religion. In short, Positivists became convinced that the world and everything in it can be explained through science. To me, this seems true for modern Atheism, because every counterpoint I come across to religion is that science has a logical explanation as well. I do recognize that science can indeed explain everything we observe and even what we cannot, but what I don't get is why a lot of Atheists use science as the only basis of their non-belief.\n\nCan't it just be possible to not believe in a higher power and still have a relationship with science, rather than basing science as the source of non-belief? I'm asking this because Positivism creates this large \"us vs. them\" gap, which seems unnecessary for both theists and non-theists, and the stigma of \"only science can explain the world\" seems just about as egotistical as \"only god can explain the world\".",

But I stand on that belief because of the word that has been handed down to us by our Jewish brothers in the Torah, the writings of the prophets and the testimony and writings of the apostles who witnessed the ministry of Christ on the earth.  To me that is proof. Hebrews 11:1, \"Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.

(Edit: In my own short interpretation, Sam Harris argues that the islam worldwide community should get its act together. The way the western world can encourage that is to keep pinning religiously inspired violence on religion. But listen for yourself for the best interpretation, of course.)\n\nTo keep it simple:\n\n - Up until now, I agreed with those Sam Harris calls liberals: I thought muslims in Europe were driven into extremism by alienation and bad integration. It's a bit more subtle than that, but basically I thought extremism didn't come from scripture, but rather negative social and economic conditions.\n\n - It seems that Sam Harris disagrees with me, and I'm having a difficult time understanding him. It seems so intuitive to me that bad integration (isolation and alienation) is the prime motivator for violent actions. My own social muslim friends go to starbucks, do fun activities, etc. Meanwhile I've watched an unsocial muslim go from being a standard introvert to delving into Islam while becoming all the more distant. Religious groups snatch up introverts like neo-nazi groups and other extreme organisations do. Isn't the best solution to convince the kids to say no?\n\n - I'm tempted to just adopt his view, because I respect him so much, and he's broadened my perspective on a lot of things in the past. I find it hard to believe that he might be wrong, and my own opinion is very much based in personal bias and anecdotes. But blindly copying his views is obviously stupid, so I'm making this post.\n\nI live in Denmark, where we had similar terrorist actions a few days ago. This is a pretty hot topic, one that I would like to be more certain about.\n\nAs a final note, having been a registered atheist for nearly ten years now, it seems to me that most people who deal with islam eventually end up developing very strong opinions against it. Meanwhile distant commentators with a less intimate insight will insist on more friendly and pragmatic stances. I have this nagging feeling that we're ignoring the most sound opinions. Like there's an elephant in the room, and we're ignoring the only people who spotted it.\n\nI don't know, adopting such a hard view on a religion just seems so harsh.",

I'm atheist because I can explain all with logic and science. I don't need a God, and I think there isn't one.\n\n(Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker).\n\n5 years ago, I decided to change my mind and become an atheist. My life is better now because I'm not afraid of anything. I told that to my parents 8 months ago, and since then, they are complaining every day about it.\n\n4 months ago, they decided to go to Medjugorje, a place where \"Holy Mary appears\" at some people (mediums).\nIt was the eighth time for me to go here. \nSo, my parents did their things but I suffered a lot, because people at Medjugorje are all so disinformed about science etc. They claim to view the Sun move, but I know it's only a \"Placebo\". They say a lot of things that are scientifically attributed to particular events. \n\nOne day, we went to a place where a medium receives a lot of people. There were old people and disabled people too, with circa 35°C. We stayed there 6 hours for the medium to meet us, but nothing. I returned to the hotel tired and angry. THERE WERE DISABLED PEOPLE SUFFERING THE HOT SUN AND NOBODY NOTICED THAT!\n\nSo, my parents spends every year $1200 for this stupid peregrination, and I can't go visiting London, Paris or other cities.\n\nMy parents are saying from 200 to 500 \"Hail Mary\" PER DAY! They are ALWAYS praying.\n\nHow can I explain them to limit their faith? Is there a way to do it? I really want them to open their eyes and be more focused on real things, they do not deserve to pray all day.\n\nBonus question: how do you deal with disinformation? I'm tired of it.",

        "text": "*Posted this on Facebook just now, with a link to a Washington Post article about certain kinds of Buddhists hating certain kinds of Muslims.*\n\n---\n\nI submit that such a divisive idea as religion always has and always will be a breeding ground for hatred. Believing *your* group has a special relationship with the transcendent—often special privileges and rights to land granted by an invisible real estate agency, too—has a way of hardening the all-too-human tendency toward tribalism.\n\nIt’s been “us vs. them” ever since Moses commanded the slaughter of the Midianites, since Jesus compared the Canaanite woman to a dog, since the New Testament writer urged believers to have nothing to do with those who didn’t toe the line, since the burnings and tortures and repression that marked Christian history from the fourth century to the seventeenth, since the brutal intolerance of Mohammed and his followers for over a thousand years, since the goon-squads of Scientology and a hundred other weird little groups, since the shunning and broken families of the Exclusive Brethren and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. And, as this article illustrates, even Buddhists, those poster children of peace and love and enlightenment in the popular view, have their share of haters.\n\nYet those of us who dare to say, “Nah, not buying it,” are often vilified and blamed and mistrusted, when we have no holy book commanding us to act worse than our sense of human decency impels, nor propping up an artificial morality that does not arise from within us. When we do not indoctrinate vulnerable people with ideas unsupported by evidence. When we have no invisible scorekeeper to reward us for rising to the defense of His fragile ego at the slightest insult.\n\nFrankly, I’m sick of the hypocrisy.\n\n---\n\n[Edit:] Am I overstating the case, perhaps just venting some frustration, by claiming religion to be a “breeding ground for hatred”? It does seem that an “us vs. them” mentality always has been part of human nature.\n\nHow much of that is just a result of our evolutionary origins? For a long time, our ancestors were hunter-gatherers who lived and roamed in small bands of familiar companions, always on guard against the threatening “other” who lurked in the shadows of their campfires. Maybe the distrust and hatred of an out-group is just inherent in us?\n\nAre there religions that truly are an exception, that truly embrace tolerance and do not pass judgment on those who believe differently? One example that comes to mind are the Unitarian Universalists, but they are so secular as to almost seem like more of a social club with a few religious traditions than an actual religion at this point.\n\nThanks for the input about the Midianite massacre and Jesus’ statement to the Canaanite woman. Yes, it is a bit of a saving grace that the military conquests in Joshua and the massacres of Amalekites and Midianites didn’t actually occur. But most Christians think they did, and defend their holy book regardless, so I tend to treat it as history even if it’s not when discussing the dark side of the Bible. And the comment regarding Jesus’ “dogs” statement made an interesting point I’ve never considered before.",

        "text": "This is my response to an article by the Jaya Saxena in the Guardian. You can find the article here: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/25/i-am-an-atheist-but-not-joining-atheism-movement\n\nDear Jaya Saxena,\n\nI would first like to point out that these are your views and opinions and they, in no way, affect me in any way. I respect your opinions, and I hope you do too mine.\n\nYou start by calling atheism a 'group of like-minded people' and 'that's what religion is for'. Although religion is a group of like minded people, not every group of like-minded people constitute a religion. It that were the case, it is surprising that we haven't have had churches of 'non smoker-ism' or 'Red Sox-ism'. From what I gather, you are labeling atheism as 'a religion of non-religion' (I might be wrong), and that in itself is paradoxical and stupid.\n\nSecondly, atheism doesn't have any leader. Neither of us unanimously accept a particular person or a group of people as the 'voice of the atheist revolution'. It's true we look up to people like Richard Dawkins or Dan Barker (or Ricky Gervais in my case) but not in a sense that would make us followers and them, leaders. We are free thinkers and our decisions are guided by an inherent morality and rational thinking, and the concept of leaders kind of defeat the purpose.\n\nThirdly, let's accept for a while that atheism does have leaders (white males, as you say). I can assure you that none of them are racist and misogynistic. I don't know what kind of atheists you have acquaintaince with, but I hope that it won't long. Literally all that atheists I know (or have interacted with, either on Reddit or other online forums, Twitter, Facebook, et cetera)  are free thinkers, and none of them are racists or misogynistics. All of them promote equality of men and women and are genuinely secular people. And neither of them is an Islamophobe. We do criticize some parts of Islam or Quran, we do condemn all the atrocities committed by extremist Muslims all the around the world, but that doesn't make us Islamophobes. Islamophobia arises from the shunning of Muslims, denying them basic human rights, and no atheist would ever do that. We have a sense of right and wrong, and Islamophobia is wrong. Of course it doesn't point to the fact that all atheists are not Islamophobes. But the number of peoole who really hate Islam is extremely low, at least among atheists.\n\nYou don't have to agree 100% to what atheism's basic ideology is. You don't have to agree even 1%. But you see, that's the beauty of atheism. There is no unanimous agreement over how the world was created, or what a person's personal definition of atheism is. We are all atheists because we don't believe in a supernatural entity, and we are certainly not a group of misogynistic, racist, Islamophobes using this platform for some kind of macho power struggle.",

I remember my youth pastor saying that Christians cannot commit it, because it's a life choice. \n\nAfter doing a bit of research on my own the last few days, it seems that apologists and commentators define blasphemy of the Holy Spirit as giving credit to Satan that which God has done. (e.g. When the Pharisees accused Jesus of doing the devil's work by casting out demons.)\n\nMy question is: if you're a non-believer, how can you be guilty of this? I don't believe in a miraculous Jesus or the evil supernatural acts of Satan. It seems to me that ONLY believers can be guilty of this sin. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "I have seen many atheists as of late attempt to defend atheism using the \"no true scotsman\" fallacy, however the Chapel Hill shooter is likely just as atheist as any one of us. **Atheism, by definition, is merely the lack of belief in a/any god(s).** It's hard to even call an atheist anything at all since the non-belief in something is hardly a remarkable definition. **There is no underlying moral agenda displayed in any sort of holy/otherwise text behind atheism, it is only merely this.** Although many atheists share an altruistic viewpoint based upon philosophies of scientific naturalist, it is important to note that not all atheists think this way.\n\nIn fact, you may even be religious or superstitious and still qualify as atheist. Just as well, you could be a sociopath dictator like Stalin and still be atheist. \n\nThe crucial point to distinguish here between atheism and religion on the subject of altruistic tendencies comes down to what good or terrible actions are condoned by each group. For atheism, nothing is condoned, everyone is free to decide what they wish of moral constructs. However, most religions have very strict sets of guidelines of morality built around their religion. \n\n**Personally, I believe that all healthy human beings will come to the same conclusions of altruism. Although, some people that are under the influences of mental \ndisease, mind-altering drugs, or dangerous manipulative ideals will fall victim to deficiencies in altruism.** Whether or not you agree with this statement has no impact on the validity of my statement that atheism is not a moral system.\n\n**Tl;dr: This is a long winded way of saying that I don't believe that we should be attempting to condone atheism as a moral subject, and defending atheism with the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. Rather, atheists are free to choose their own moral constructs.**\n\nJust my two cents, do any of you agree, disagree?",

I hope that also, this man can come to terms with the fact that he unlawfully took 3 human beings lives. \n\nAnd I think that perhaps is the greatest irony of religion. Many religions teach in a vengeful and vindictive God, which sounds great until you realize vengeance is not justice. This man does not need (or technically even deserve) an eternity in \"hell\" or \"damnation\". Instead he needs and deserves a punishment fitting to the crime. \n\nThis is a crucial time for us atheists. Many people are *claiming* the murderer's motivations were derived from his atheism, that atheism hates Muslims, or fosters religious hate (even though we know this is not true). \n\nLet us show the irony of such statement, by pushing justice over revenge, actually doing something meaningful instead of simply praying, and showing solidarity for the victims families. Because regardless of their religious views, they are people who lost loved ones, and if atheism is to live up to its goals, we should be able to comfort them as such. \n\n*Edit for clarity. \n",

There are also a myriad of other articles and statements which have been issued from and about the 'Atheist community' in the wake of this event.\n\nIt's of note to me that this has given me a taste (albeit very small) of the disgust and need for implicit condemnation that many religious people must feel in the wake of such events being attributed to their beliefs/faith.\n\n\n",

I destroyed my family.\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2viv83/well_i_destroyed_my_family/)\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- Mormon missionary comes home\n\n- Reads a document called [\"Letter to a CES Director,\"](http://cesletter.com) and researches the claims it makes against the Mormon church\n\n- Realized what he was taught wasn't true, has a faith crisis\n\n- Tells his family\n\n- Other family members express doubts\n\n- Spouses of those family members threaten divorce if the other stops going to church\n\n- the OP is now blamed by the faithful family members as the \"an apostate who will stop at nothing to destroy the church and my family.\"\n\n-----\n\nTo understand this requires understanding that in order to get to top heaven in Mormonism, you have to marry another faithful Mormon in the temple, and both of you have to stay faithful for life. This allows your marriage to continue in heaven, gives you deification, and allows your parental association with your children to continue as well.\n\nIf one person drops out, then the other one will not be able to have all of those promises. Essentially, your heavenly reward is dependent on another person's faithfulness.\n\n-----\n\nIs this a unique thing? I know that other groups like Jehovah's Witnesses use ostracism.\n\nWhat about Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, Islam, etc etc? I know that depending on the individuals, there will be fights in any family. But do the actual churches have specific doctrines and teachings that are essentially a trigger switch?\n\nI'm isolated against other religions where I am, so I really have no exposure to the cultures that grow around their teachings.",
