Even though he doubts he'll find anything, he performs a basic physical exam and as he suspects, nothing immediately seems out of the ordinary.\n\nThinking the condition may be inorganic in nature, he begins narrowing down possible environmental causes.

One day he got his chance when he was assigned to clean up the prison's storage room.   Jack quickly started to look for a way out, but he soon realized the only way out was through the door, which was locked from the outside. Then he remembered that the storage room was full of extension cords, so he quickly snatched one up and began to tie it around the door handle. After a few minutes of hard work, Jack had created a lasso out of the extension cord and was able to pull the door open.  Jack was free! But before he could leave, he was stopped by a guard. The guard, seeing Jack with the extension cord in his hands, asked him what he was doing. Jack replied, \"I'm just trying to get out of this mass incarceration!\"   The guard was so impressed with Jack's ingenuity that he decided not to punish him, but instead gave him a job as a prison electrician. From then on, Jack was known as the master of mass incarceration escape!",

So, how are you getting there?”\n\n“We’re taking United,” was the reply. “We got a great rate!”\n\n“United!” exclaimed the barber. “That’s a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly and they’re always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?”\n\n“We’ll be at the downtown International Marriott.”\n\n“That dump! That’s the worst hotel in Rome. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they’re overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?”\n\n\"We’re going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.\"\n\n\"That’s rich,” laughed the barber. “You and a million other people trying to see him. He’ll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You’re going to need it!”\n\nA month later, Dave again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome.\n\n“It was wonderful,” explained Dave. “Not only were we on time in one of United’s brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful young stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel! Well, it was great! They’d just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it’s the finest hotel in the city. They were overbooked too, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!”\n\n“Well,” muttered the barber. “I know you didn’t get to see the Pope.”\n\n“Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I’d be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked in. As I knelt down he spoke to me.”\n\n“What did he say?”\n\n“He said, ‘Where’d you get this shitty haircut?\"",

        "text": "A team of scientists were exploring a newly discovered island with a handful of different tribes that had been living there for centuries, and were being led by a guide of one of the peaceful tribes.\n\nAs the trek went on, the jungle continued to get thicker.  As they got deeper into the jungle, a faint sound of drums could be heard in the far distance.  One of the scientists asks the guide,\n\n\"Is that something we should be worried about?\"\n\n\"No, not at all we're completely safe,\" replied the guide.\n\nThey trekked deeper and the drums became louder and were clearly becoming more intense.  Again, one of the scientists asks,\n\n\"Are you sure we're OK?\"\n\nThe guide replies, \"Completely fine.\"\n\nAs they got really deep into the jungle, the drums had become *very* loud and *very* intense.  One of the scientists stops the guide in his tracks and asks again with clear worry in his voice,\n\n\"How can you be sure we're safe?\"\n\n\"As long as the drums are beating, we're safe,\" replies the guide.\n\nThe scientist, becoming terrified, asks,\n\n\"What happens when the drums stop??\"\n\nThe guide slowly turns to face the scientist, looks him dead in the eye and says,\n\n\"Bass solo.\"",
