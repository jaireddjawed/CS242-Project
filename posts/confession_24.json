        "text": "It’s been over 10 years since HS and I’m still proud of this. \n\nIn HS I was shy and quiet and was good with many crowds. Quiet kids, popular kids, nerds, etc. I was friends with whoever was nice and I got along with. \n\nIn math class a girl who was very outspoken and claimed to be a “popular girl” sat behind me. She was as dumb as a rock. But needed good grades because she was the “star” of the softball team. \nWhenever we would get our tests back she would ask everyone around her for their score and would complain that hers were always low. \n\nShe started to realize my scores were always higher and TOLD me she was going to copy off of me. I wasn’t abnormally smart or anything but I WAS unconfrontational. So I let her. And her next test came back with a good score. \n\nShe started to brag about her score and got a big head about it. She started being nice to me and tried to befriend me but I could tell it was not genuine in the slightest. I started to get annoyed at her inflated ego and decided to put her in her place. \n\nThe next test I let her copy again but I would intentionally mark the wrong answers. She would turn her test in and then I would change my answers. When the test came back she was pissed that her score was low and mine wasn’t. She even tried to argue with the teacher about it. And then turned her frustration to me, I chalked it up to “Maybe you just saw the wrong answer and marked it. Sorry!” \n\nNext few tests I did it again and would mark more and more answers wrong each time. It became tricky because I would have to be sneaky about changing them back after she would sit back down. Eventually she stopped copying off of me. I’m pretty sure she failed the class or at least got a D. And she had to retake the class. I do not feel bad at all. Maybe if she was a more genuine person I would have helped her out.",
