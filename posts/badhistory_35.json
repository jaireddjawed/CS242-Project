        "text": "Hi, first time here, not an historian by any measure, fairly new on Reddit and English-Is-Not-My-Native-Language^TM , so please go easy on me...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI found myself on the [Wikipedia article on Aristarchus of Samos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos#Heliocentrism), and the section Heliocentrism deeply puzzled me. To play safe, I even asked for confirmations and more precise data on [AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/33kzls/is_the_aristarchus_of_samos_wikipedia_article/), getting some answers from badhistory user /u/rosemary85 . \n\n\nAs of 05/04/2015, such section states, with boldface added by me *(BTW, does anybody know how to quote Wikipedia easily and preserving the formatting?)*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;Aristarchus suspected the stars were other suns[3] that are very far away, and that in consequence there was no observable parallax, that is, a movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moves around the Sun. The stars are much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times; and since stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes, his speculation although accurate was unprovable at the time.\n&gt;\n&gt;The geocentric model was consistent with planetary parallax and was assumed to be the reason why no stellar parallax was observed. As known, Ptolemy later preferred the geocentric model which was held for true during the Middle Age.\n&gt;\n&gt;**A demonstration of Aristarchus' heliocentric model was given by Seleucus of Seleucia**, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus.[4] **The fact that Pliny the Elder[5] and Seneca[6] still referred to planets' retrograde motion as an apparent phenomenon, suggests that heliocentrism was an accepted theory still by their times**.\n&gt;\n&gt;**It is a common idea that the heliocentric view was rejected by the contemporaries of Aristarchus. This is due to Gilles Ménage's translation of a passage from Plutarch's On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon**. Plutarch reported that Cleanthes (a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics) as a worshipper of the Sun and opponent to the heliocentric model, was jokingly told by Aristarchus that he should be charged of impiety. Gilles Ménage, shortly after the trials of Galileo and Giordano Bruno, amended an accusative with a nominative, and vice versa, so that the impiety accusation fell over the heliocentric sustainer. The resulting conception of an isolated and persecuted Aristarchus is still transmitted today.[7]\n&gt;\n&gt;The heliocentric theory was successfully revived by Copernicus, after which Johannes Kepler described planetary motions with greater accuracy, with Kepler's laws, and Isaac Newton gave a theoretical explanation based on laws of gravitational attraction and dynamics.\n&gt;\n&gt;[3] Louis Strous. \"[Who discovered that the Sun was a star?](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html)\". solar-center.stanford.edu. Retrieved 2014-07-13.\n&gt;\n&gt;[4] Plutarch, Platonicae quaestiones, VIII, i\n&gt;\n&gt;[5] Naturalis historia, II, 70\n&gt;\n&gt;[6] Naturales quaestiones, VII, xxv, 6–7\n&gt;\n&gt;[7] Lucio Russo, Silvio M. Medaglia, Sulla presunta accusa di empietà ad Aristarco di Samo, in \"Quaderni urbinati di cultura classica\", n.s. 53 (82) (1996), pp. 113–121\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have the the following problems with its History:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1. The *\"A demonstration of Aristarchus' heliocentric model was given by Seleucus of Seleucia\"* period is bollocks. At best, as one also finds in [Neugebauer's History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy (1975) pg. 697](https://books.google.it/books?id=6tkqBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=PA697#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) Plutarch might have told us that he thought he had given one, which is completely different. I am studying Physics, and from my readings about the History of Science it is quite clear to me that the Greeks had just no way to prove heliocentrism, the main problems being lack of parallax and the impossibility of explaining the lack of dynamical effects from the supposed Earth's non-inertial reference frame (using a modern language) with their theoretical instruments.\n\n2. The article gives the impression that heliocentrism was actually some sort of a standard model of cosmology in ancient times, until those bad, bad Dark Ages came. To the best of /u/rosemary85 's [knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/33kzls/is_the_aristarchus_of_samos_wikipedia_article/cqlxerl), this is false, the only known named person to embrace the idea from Aristarchus being Seleucus himself. The opposite would have been simply bizarre, since at the time geomobility solved no problem (cinematically speaking everything was equivalent) and introduced many (again, parallax and dynamics).\n\n3. It gives such impression by arguing on primary sources by Pliny the Elder and Seneca (something that as far as I know should be prohibited as hell on Jimbo Wales Big W) which [look like having nothing to do with this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/33kzls/is_the_aristarchus_of_samos_wikipedia_article/cqmiby6). This does not surprise me, since I never heard of them in any debate on the history of Heliocentrism.\n\n4. Saying that Aristarchus theory was \"revived\" by Copernicus looks to me quite a stretch, given that pretty much nothing else than \"Sun in the middle\" was know about such theory, but this is just nitpicking.\n\n5. *\"It is a common idea that the heliocentric view was rejected by the contemporaries of Aristarchus. This is due to Gilles Ménage's translation [...]\"* and, I'd say, to the opinion of pretty much every other ancient astronomer we know of.\n\n6. **Edit 23:25 (GMT +2):** Holy Shit! I read source *[3] Louis Strous. \"[Who discovered that the Sun was a star?](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html)\". solar-center.stanford.edu.* Follow my steps only if you are not easily impressionable, because this piece by a professional astronomer is one of the most idiotic thing I ever read on the matter, an amazing synopsis on how one can be wrong on the history of astronomy.^It'd ^deserve ^a ^/(long!) ^post ^on ^his ^own\n\n6. **Edit 06/05/2015 , 14:37 (GMT +2):** As /u/rosemary85 [has written below](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/34yrn9/wikipedias_article_on_aristarchus_of_samos/cqzkft3), even the bit about Ménage's translation doesn't make any sense.\n\n7. The first of the few secondary sources used by the article, and the only one in the summary, is the infamous *\"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science\"* by Draper. This actually explains much.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy experience with Wikipedia is pretty much limited to having myself kicked out of my language's version after a series of heated discussions with an administrator on Giordano Bruno, Galileo and Tycho ^*(with ^it's ^salient ^points ^being ^him ^adding ^to ^some ^articles ^a ^whole ^lot ^of ^arguing ^on ^primary ^sources ^to ^prove ^that ^Galileo ^knew ^that ^stars ^were ^point ^like, ^ignoring [^my ^peer ^review ^sources](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?db_key=AST&amp;bibcode=2010JHA....41..453G&amp;letter=.&amp;classic=YES&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;page=453&amp;epage=453&amp;send=Send+PDF&amp;filetype=.pdf), ^and ^substituting ^my ^sources ^on ^Giordano ^Bruno ^unscientific ^approach ^from ^Jole ^Shackelford, ^Ronald ^L. ^Numbers, ^Angelo ^Mercati, ^Frances ^Yales ^and ^Richard ^Olson ^with... ^a ^quote ^by ^Stephen ^Hawking)* , my knowledge on the subject is limited and I might be not the best diplomat, so I think I won't do anything about it. \n\nHowever, I believe such inaccuracies deeply worrisome. Wikipedia is, sadly, the main source of \"knowledge\" for a lot of people, and as far as I know such articles only contribute to the propagating of myths.",

        "text": "[Thought you guys might like this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34ple6/current_or_former_sex_workers_what_is_your/cqxgna5)\n\n&gt;It is actually very hard to find examples of this 'patriarchy' or 'patriarchal views' in history outside of very recent (historically speaking), US-centric history.\n\n**Patriarchy is a social system in which: males hold primary power; males predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property; and, in the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children.**\n\nLet's let the Greek general Meno tell us how not-patriarchal his society was:\n\n&gt;First of all, if you take the virtue of a man, it is easily stated that a man's virtue is this—that he be competent to manage the affairs of his city, and to manage them so as to benefit his friends and harm his enemies, and to take care to avoid suffering harm himself. Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband.\n\nAnd I don't care if the women's vote made Athena your patron god, excluding them from participation in the government is an indicator of a patriarchal society.\n\n\n&gt;Outside of the US, infantilising women was the opposite of what people wanted to do.\n\n&gt;Women who were meek, weak, infantile etc were seen as sub-prime mates or partners.\n\n&gt;Strong, intelligent, cunning, brave women where seen as the ideal.\n\nBroad Generalizations R US\n\n&gt;An example would be the Japanese Yamato Nadeshiko, the Japanese ideal women:\n\n&gt;She would be wise, motherly, caring, gentle etc (what feminists call 'infantilising) but also intelligent, skilled in combat (both armed and unarmed), cunning, quick-witted etc.\n\nI don't know what anime this man has been watching but Yamato Nadeshiko is used to refer to the \"good girls\" in the old days who would literally act like innocent children.\n\n&gt;And taking a look through history, from the back-room dealings of the equite and patrician classes (or the nations equivalent) in the Ancient Era, which saw **just as many intelligent and massively powerful women as there were men**, to the courtly goings on of the Dark and Middle Ages (which also saw a large number of powerful women), to the renaissance and later.\n\n[Citation Needed]\n\n&gt;For example, the 'women as property' laws. Did you know that it wasnt just women that were subject to them? The elderly, infirm, the children etc. Essentially everyone who was not a young, fit, male was seen as property.\n\nI'd figure treating all women as if they were children might be some sort of indicator but no.\n\n&gt;Why?\n\nOh, do tell.\n\n&gt;Because, in the era the law was created (Dark/Early Middle ages to the Low Period Middle Ages), when there wasnt a police force or dedicated investigation department, there were virtually no laws pertaining to a person. Almost every law was based upon property (it was easier to legislate for and enforce).\n\nFirstly, this is absolute and complete bullshit. The county court system, sheriff and all, was in place in England by the turn of the 10th century and laws pertaining to people are literally older than the concept of private property. \n\nSecond, this still doesn't explain why women had to be made property.\n\n&gt;Also, it could also be claimed by the courts that anything bad that happened to the 'property' was the fault of the person they belonged to, thus we get the young men been given the blame if something goes wrong (rightly or wrongly).\n\nIn what case would someone sue themselves over harm to their own property?\n\n&gt;So, in light of that, what was the best way to make sure the weaker members of society (at a time when physical power and strength was at its most important) were protected as best as they could be?\n\n&gt;By making them property in the eyes of the law.\n\nOh, so it's not a patriarchal system. We are just doing what's best for women?\n\nFunny, because for almost the entire palaeolithic era, a time when \"physical power and strength\" were arguably more important, we managed to not make women property.\n\nThis also makes it out to be some new European trend. Does Sharia law borrow from English Civil Law? Does Hammurabi's?\n\n&gt;Does this mean women (and other groups) were treated as property? Hell no, far from it. In fact, i cannot find a single piece of evidence that this actually happened outside of a handful of isolated cases, in which case even period writings on the subject villainize, rightly, the man for being a brute and overbearing (and more than one tale ends with the man ending up face down in a ditch).\n\nI'm sure the sheer amount of evidence you can't think of could fill libraries.\n\n&gt;It is also extremely important to note that, at this time, almost every person pushing for the abolition if the old, outdated laws were men/male politicians. There were only a handful of women (and not because women couldnt get into politics. Hell, in Britain, women were voting in the local elections as early as the 1840's, if not earlier, and there were female MPs from at least the 1850's).\n\nThe fist woman to cast a vote in Britain was Lily Maxwell in **1867** and guess what? Her vote was declared **illegal.**\n\nVoting in local elections were not allowed until 1869.\n\nThe first female MP was Nancy Astor in **1919.**\n\n&gt;For example, Chivalry (aka, putting the woman before the man), something villainised by feminists, was nothing but beneficial for women. It was 'benevolent' sexism to women. Whilst it did have some issues (somewhat unfair to men, some issues with underestimating certain things about women), most of it was actually good for all (general respect and manners, politeness, general courtesy etc).\n\nM'benevolence.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/34uj1u/only_22_maps_have_never_had_inaccuracies_and_this/",
        "text": "[This map](http://www.statista.com/chart/3441/countries-never-invaded-by-britain/) popped up this morning on /r/mapporn, and while it does make an interesting statement about the British Empire, it's also rather wrong. There's a number of levels, but to me, the most interesting aspect by which it's wrong is the fact that some of the places that the UK supposedly invaded simply weren't countries when the UK supposedly invaded them. It goes back to the question raised in another thread about when something becomes a country, and at what point it could be said to be interacting with other entities on an international level.\n\nTake the example of Sudan and South Sudan, for instance. The map is correct in saying that the UK invaded Sudan - it did so as part of scramble of Africa, [governing Sudan from 1896 to 1939.](http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/sudan-british-colonialisms-divide-and-rule-1896-1939) Throughout this governance, troops were sent to quell the black *sudani* population on several occasions, and were used to help bolster racist and pro-Egyptian policies, especially during the 1924 uprisings. By the 1890s when the British invaded Sudan, the north, certainly, was a united entity that could definitely be considered a country. Indeed, one of the large motivations for the British invasion was to support Egyptians against Sudanese Mahdist forces that had invaded previously. If we want to talk about countries and countries being entities that could be invaded, this is a prime example. Sudan was definitely invaded by the British.\n\nThe issue, though, is that South Sudan is not listed as a country the UK didn't invade. South Sudan is a country that gained its independence in 2011, and, to the best of my knowledge, has not been invaded by the UK in the past four years, unless you count aid workers as an invasion force which most people do not. While the land that currently comprises South Sudan existed at the time of the British rule of Sudan, South Sudan as a political entity did not. It wasn't a country. It wasn't even really a concept. It did not exist to be invaded. \n\nHerein lies one of the major problems with the map. Can a country be said to have been invaded if it didn't exist at the time? It's something that can be repeated all over the map of Africa. Namibia, too, broke away from a former British colony, but was never invaded by the British. Angola, Central African Republic, DRC, and others didn't exist to be invaded (or, in the case of some others weren't invaded at all). Personally, I have issues with the idea that a country can be invaded before it exists. A bit of land and a nation are different things, and ought to be recognised as such. \n\nThere's also the question that the vast swaths of Europe that have apparently been invaded by the UK raises - what counts as an invasion? Setting aside the question of countries' existence for the moment, is a declaration of war enough to count as an invasion? The only conflict I know of between the UK and Slovakia, for instance, is the UK declaring war on them during WWII, but this wasn't accompanied by troops in the ground in Slovakia. It's not something I would count as an invasion by any means. For that matter, are ground troops necessary to constitute an invasion? While British troops volunteered as UN peacekeepers during the Yugoslav Wars and British planes dropped bombs on the Balkans, British ground forces weren't sent in. Does that count as an invasion, even though the only troops explicitly flying British colours were thousands of feet above the ground? Is there a difference between \"liberation\" and \"invasion?\" I suspect the people living in these countries would say there is, but I suppose it's also always a matter of perspective.\n\nYou get the idea. There are lots of things to consider, and this map simply doesn't do it. It's one thing to map out the spread of the British empire. It's a worthy enough endeavour, and there's definite historical value to it. There is, however, much less value to assigning the word \"invasion\" to countries that either didn't exist or weren't really invaded. Sending a few zealous soldiers into Rwanda, for instance, does not an invasion make, nor does declaring war but not sending troops. Doing so devalues what an \"invasion\" actually is, and misrepresents what war and empires actually are. Claiming countries exist before they actually do, too, is a rather bad faux pas. Claiming they were invaded before they existed makes about as much sense as the guy who hits someone's testicles to get even with their grandchildren. No sense. At all.",

        "text": "So i don't know if you are familiar with the works of Humon. She is a Danish woman who draws various webcomics. [Here](http://humon.deviantart.com/) is her Deviantart page and [here](http://humoncomics.com/) is her official website (warning: both are NSFW). She has gained quite a good deal of critics on the Internet, because of her oafish and ignorant comments on various people and cultures and the disturbing sexual content in some of her comics and art. However, i just want to focus on one of her comics, the Hetalia-ripoff [Scandinavia And The World](http://satwcomic.com/). In this comic i've found many instances of nationalistic Danish bad history as well as just bad history in general. Let's start with [this Doozy.](http://satwcomic.com/how-old) \n&gt;I’ve drawn Denmark as younger than Sweden and Norway a few times, but that had to do with the age of the landmass. This shows how old the Nordics are as countries. \n\n&gt;Denmark’s birth is from when it became a united country instead of tribes fighting each other, Sweden is from King Gustav Vasa's crowning and Norway, Finland and Iceland are from when they became fully independent from all other countries.\n\n&gt;Norway is a bit tricky though, because he could also be said to be around the same age as Denmark. But this is how it's usually done.\n\nFirst of all, what does she mean by \"countries\"? Is she sure she's not thinking about \"nations\"? Or rather \"nation-states\"? Swedish Wikipedia defines \"nation\" as \"a collective of people who are united by common factors such as language, religion, ethnicity, ancestry, history, culture, traditions, common form of leadership and shared social norms\". It defines \"nation-state\" as a state which is built up around this concept. Lastly it defines \"country\" as \"a territory wich makes up a sovereign or autonomous political unit\". So judging on what she's written, it really beats me what Humon means by \"countries\" in this context, but on to her arguments. To claim that Sweden was \"born\" in 1523 is utterly ridiculous, but first, let's focus on Denmarks supposed \"birth\" and play Humons game for a while. The claim that Denmark was born in the 11th century is based on [one of the two Runestones at Jellinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelling_stones#Runestone_of_Harald_Bluetooth) wich reads: \n\n&gt; King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father, and in memory of Thyrvé, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian.\n\nWhere was this Denmark and who where these Danes? Do we know anything about wether or not they had a shared ethnicity, social norms, common form of leadership and so on? No, all we know is that the name \"Denmark\" is written down on a rock from the 10th century (not the 11th as Humon claims, so that is bonus bad history) and she is basing her entire argument on this. As i said, we are going to play her game for a while, so lets look at Sweden. Swedes refer to their country as \"Sverige\" wich literally means \"The realm of the Swedes\". When is this name first encountered in history? Well, in the epic poem of Beowulf we have the name \"Swiorice\" wich is apparently etymologically the same. When was Beowulf written? During the 11th century according to most modern historians although some think it was during the 8th. And although Beowulf is a work of fiction it contains many people and places which existed for real. So there you have it, i can claim Sweden was born during the 8th century AD! Only i wont, because it's fucking *redonkulous* to claim such a thing when we have only scraps of *real* information to go by. That is why it's called the \"Dark Ages\" because we are \"in the dark\" about so much that happened during them. Anyway, to claim that Sweden was \"born\" in 1523 is like i said, horseshit, because during the reign of king Magnus Eriksson (1319-1364 AD) Sweden encompassed nearly *all* of it's modern territory (Svealand, Götaland, Gotland, plus Scania and Norway in a union with us) and it was also during this time that king Magnus drafted his \"landslag\" (it's hard to translate, but i think \"federal law\" comes the closest, athough it's not quite right) wich stipulated, among other things, that any man who wanted to be king of Sweden had to ride through every Swedish province to be accepted as such by the lawspeakers there. This law encompassed *ALL* of the country, unlike the previous \"landskapslagar\" wich had been far more provincial (i guess people were bitching about \"states rights\" even in them days)! It is also during this period that Sweden starts being referred to as \"Swerighe\". So whaddya know, during the 14th century AD, there was a country called \"Sverige\" wich encompassed nearly all the territory of modern Sweden and had a common law and apparently enough shared common factors for the king to have to ride through the entire country and be accepted by every lawspeaker at every thing. The reason why Gustav Vasa is often called \"the founding father of Sweden\" is because he instituted many things that are still being felt in Swedish society today: hereditary monarchy, Lutheranism, the first Swedish language Bible etc, etc. But there wasn't exactly fucking blank space here, before he came along. Also notice how Humon begrudgingly admits that \"Norway could be around the same age as as Denmark\" just to spite Sweden. \n\n[Next case:](http://satwcomic.com/kiss-it-better)\n\n&gt; Dudo of St. Quentin records an encounter between a party of Danes and King Charles of the Frankish kingdom. In the presence of the king, the Danes were ordered to show their submission by kissing the foot of the king. The leader of the Danes refused. One of his followers complied. But, rather than kneeling to kiss the foot of King Charles, the Dane stood, grabbed the king's foot, and lifted it up to the level of the Dane's own head, dragging the king out of his seat and onto the floor. With the king held upside-down, the Dane kissed the foot.\n\nThat \"Dane\" was [Rollo Of Normandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo) and we know jack shit about wether or not he was a \"Dane\" or anything about his ancestry for that matter. But Humon doesn't let that stop her!\n\n[\"They grow up so fast\".](http://satwcomic.com/they-grow-up-so-fast)\n\n&gt; If only Norway and Sweden had known how much trouble Denmark was going to be when he grew up...\n\n&gt;Because Denmark is made of sand from Norway, that means we have no natural resources. That is the main &gt;reason why Denmark went crazy and was so obsessed with taking over the other Nordic countries. \n\n&gt;And you have to be impressed. Look up Scandinavia on a map. Can you even imagine that the tiny little Denmark &gt;ended up ruling over Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, The Faroe Islands and even part of Germany?\n\nNo we don't have to be impressed, Humon. That the Kalmar Union was supposed to have been some sort of mighty, gargantuan Danish Empire is one of the most long lived myths in the Scandinavian historical narrative. The union started as a pan-Scandinavian effort to counter the influences of the Hanseatic League. Unlike what [Sweden did to Denmark in 1658](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_across_the_Belts) Denmark didn't just march a giant army into Stockholm and say \"submit or die\". The Genesis of the Kalmar Union started with Swedes and Danes fighting *beside* each other against the German mercenary forces of [Albert of Mecklenburg at the battle of Åsle.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_King_of_Sweden) There was a treaty signed at Kalmar castle in 1397 wich stipulated that [Eric Of Pomerania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_of_Pomerania) shall be king of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, he shall rule each kingdom according to it's ancient laws, if any of the kingdoms is threatened by war the others must come to it's aid, outlaws will not be granted amnesty in any of the kingdoms, and during negotiations with other countries the king along with council-members from every kingdom, alone has the right to make decisions for the greater good of everyone. It should be noted that Sweden was more or less independent already, during large parts of the 15th century. Also, notice the hypocrisy. A moment ago Sweden didn't exist before 1523. But when Denmark supposedly \"ruled\" over us then we apparently did. \n\n[The Love Story Of Bornholm.](http://satwcomic.com/the-love-story-of-bornholm)\n\n&gt; The story behind this comic is that Sweden once defeated Denmark, and the Danish king had to give up most of &gt;Denmark and parts of Norway (which was under Denmark at the time) so as not to loose the entire kingdom. \n&gt;But the Swedish king was a bit of a bully at the time, and Bornholm quickly grew tired of being part of Sweden, &gt;so they killed as many Swedes as they could get their hands on, until the rest finally left.\n&gt;Then they went back to Denmark and told the king that they would be part of his kingdom again if he promised &gt;to never give them away like that again. They just liked Denmark that much.\n\n&gt;Apart from the killing Swedes part, I think it’s actually a pretty cute story.\n\nOMG SO KAWAII, CUTE! Only we'll have to disregard the fact that less than 20 Swedes died in the Bornholm uprising. \"The great pig slaughter\" as the Danes so charmingly call it, is a myth.\n\n[Come and get it Big Boy.](http://satwcomic.com/come-and-get-it-big-boy)\n\n&gt; Denmark did at one point hit rock bottom. We were losing land fast, and finally the king just had to accept that &gt;Denmark was never going to be a great empire again. In desperation he tried to give Denmark away to Prussia, &gt;but not even they wanted us! The king even asked them three times, but every time the answer was, “No. Fuck &gt;off”! D:\n\n&gt;There were various reasons why they didn’t want Denmark at the time. One was out of fear of pissing off England &gt;and France who would see that move as an attempt to become a colonial power, and even though Denmark &gt;wasn’t worth much on it’s own it could have done a lot of damage in Prussia’s hands, what with still owning &gt;Greenland, Iceland and the Virgin Islands, not to mention controlling all shipping in and out of the Baltic Sea. &gt;Denmark didn’t have the means to do much with those areas, but Prussia could have placed military bases on &gt;them. USA, Russia, England and France would have seen that as quite a threat.\n\n&gt;But one of the reasons was also that the Danes didn’t speak German, and at the time Prussia was more interest in &gt;collection the German speaking countries rather than just hoard land.\n\n&gt;Nazi Germany taking over Denmark had noting to do with Prussia not wanting us. He’s just there for comedic &gt;effect.\n\nDenmark sure as hell didn't control *ALL* the shipping in an out of the Baltic at this point. Sweden had been toll-free ever since the Middle Ages, and i guess the [Göta Canal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ta_Canal) don't real.\n\n**RULE 5**: Scandinavia And The World is full of bad history in the form of convenient definitions, implications and outright falsehoods all with passive-aggressive demonization of Sweden running like a red thread throughout it. Humons stated purpose with creating this comic was that she didn't think Hetalia nailed the stereotypes that the Nordic countries has about each other, but i think it's more a case of Humon being butthurt over the fact that in Hetalia, [Sweden is portrayed as a Stoic Badass](http://bamboothicket2.livejournal.com/383617.html) whereas [Denmark is portrayed as an arrogant idiot.](http://hetarchive.tumblr.com/post/63909205621/scanlation-magic-words-for-denmark) I mean comics like [this](http://satwcomic.com/hetalia-personality-swap) more or less proves it. Oh and one more thing. [This might not technically be bad history, but if she finds this funny, it tells alot about what kind of person Humon is.](http://satwcomic.com/monkey-man)",

A couple years ago, Elhaik came under fire for a genetics paper implying that most European Jews are not of Middle Eastern descent, but instead were descended from wandering Turkic nomads called the Khazars. This is a notable but borderline [crackpot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteenth_Tribe) theory that has been appropriated as an anti-Semitic libel. Elhaik was able to prove that modern Jews were more closely related to \"Khazars\" than they were to ancient Israelites...for a certain definition of \"Khazars.\" As the Khazars are an extinct people, he modeled their DNA using which of the following peoples:\n\na) Kazakhs, a modern Central Asian Turkic people living along the eastern fringes of ancient Khazaria\n\nb) [Chuvash, a Turkic people whose language is the closest living relative to Khazar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghur_languages)\n\nc) North Caucasians, who are the indigenous people of the Khazar heartland\n\nd) [Armenians, who were never conquered by the Khazars and share neither linguistic, geographic, nor historical links with them](http://www.oocities.org/athens/sparta/3976/webmap1.jpg)?\n\n&gt;Elhaik compared “genetic signatures” found in Jewish populations with those of modern-day Armenians and Georgians, which he uses as a stand-in for the long-extinct Khazarians because they live in the same area as the medieval state.\n\nIf you suspected d), you're right. Elhaik unilaterally redefined Khazars as south Caucasians, a people who [are very much a Middle Eastern people](http://i43.tinypic.com/11jst3m.jpg), and not as Central Asian Turks. Basically, this would be like \"proving\" that the ancient Romans were genetically Scandinavians by using modern Germans, *not* Mediterraneans, as a stand-in for ancient Rome, which no longer exists.\n\ned:iting in source",

[A pure or predominant Khazar origin of the Ashkenazim (Yiddish-speakers) is a fringe theory.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars) On the other hand, modern Scandinavians [most definitely do have Khazar DNA](http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=1307) but you don't hear people questioning *their* \"whiteness\" for some reason.\n\n&gt;The conspiracy to control the world by international bankers is not a Jewish plot, but a Turkish plot.

That's weird and everything, but not the point of this post. I'm commenting on the oh-so-common, \"Che was a maniacal tyrant who killed thousands, put the gays in camps, and was super racist\" trope.\n\nNow, we all know Che (like literally everyone in history) was not perfect and the opposite end of this argument (that Che was the second coming of Socialist Jesus) is also ridiculous. However, the posts I've seen mentioning him on any default sub nearly always take the maniacal tyrant view of him (source: search for Che in TIL, OldSchoolCool, AskReddit, etc).\n\nNow, my original method of response was to remain level and post [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1lt4rb/was_it_the_truth_behind_the_critical_controversy/cc2l72k) excellent breakdown of the Che controversy from /r/AskHistorians. It's a good primer and is well sourced as a starting point for someone who would like to learn more. It's also balanced and asks actual, thoughtful questions about how we view historical figures.\n\nI'd recommend reading it, but the basic premise is this:\n\nThe negative stereotypes about Che tend to be gross exaggerations, blatantly false, or completely lacking in context. This doesn't confirm the patron saint narrative, but it does do a good job of debunking the maniacal tyrant narrative.\n\nThus, on to his comments:\n\n&gt;Anti-authoritarian from the guys who love totalitarian murderer Che Guevara. They call him the 5th member of their band. He admitted he would have fired nukes at the USA if the USSR had let him, and he hated the USSR for the rest of his life for denying him the opportunity. He also banned rock music and put gays in camps. RATM are the equivalent of neo nazi bands for communism.\n\nYes, apparently Che did say that if the missiles had been in Cuban control they would have been fired. Did he really mean this or was he still angry from what he thought was a betrayal by Soviets? After all, he felt that the USSR was attempting to make Cuba just another pawn of the Cold War. Would he have actually tried to push the proverbial button? Maybe, but I can't find the actual quote in any source that doesn't require a login. Anyone help in that regard?\n\nHere's a quote I can access the source for:\n\n\"Direct aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war. The Americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact. I have no doubt they would lose such a war.\" - Che\n\nRemember, this comes in the context of Cuba being 90 miles away from the United States and the United States showing and engaging in open aggression. The Bay of Pigs Invasion was the previous year, attempts had been made against Castro's life, and the US had engaged in numerous attempts at subversion. Castro was also convinced another US invasion (this time with the full power of the United States military) was coming.\n\nBesides, I doubt he views Truman or MacArthur as being just as bad, but they're not dirty commies and their nukes weren't aimed at us, so that's different.\n\nHowever, that's not the worst of the Bad History here today.\n\n&gt;I don't need to read it\n\nand\n\n&gt;It's on his wikipedia page, which is really all I need to read to know enough about him to form an opinion.\n\n1. He insists he doesn't need to read someone's response in order to make a good argument.\n\n2. He thinks Wikipedia is a good source for making an informed historical opinion.\n\n3. He shuns a post by someone knowledgeable on the topic (a well sourced and reasoned post with commentators offering their own views and pieces of information) in exchange for Wikipedia. I mean, why even bother reading a source that could challenge my views when I could just read one sentence out of context that confirms it?\n\nThis is some of the worst historical discourse I've had the displeasure of participating in in quite some time. \n\nRegardless, it's a really common view of Che that just isn't supported by historical facts.\n\nTL;DR: Turns out that Che isn't as bad as grandpappy says he was.\n\nEdit: Hey guys! A lot of good discussion here. I feel as though this post has done a good job of encapsulating the controversy of Che without it devolving into ahistorical bullshit. Kudos.",

        "text": "Ok, so I'm taking a class this semester on Vietnam. The prof has a PhD in American and Asian history and did masters and doctoral work on the foreign policy of America in Asia. This is his baby. \n\nSo to have this [kind of nonsense](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/34duc2/fall_of_saigon_recognized_as_the_end_of_the/cqtvss4) come up rubs me the wrong way. \n\nI'll go through this briefly, as I have another class in a bit. \n\n&gt; The US did not attempt to win the war as this was not the military objective of fighting in Vietnam.\n\nSo we didn't try to win the war. We didn't even think to say, \"hey, this is war, we may want to win.\" I honestly don't know what else I could say to explain how wrong this is. \n\n&gt; The purpose of the war was to demonstrate to the USSR that the US was willing to fight a decade long, high casualty war based entirely on anti-communist ideology.\n\nThe only correct part of this statement is that we considered this a war against Communism. While there was a lot of debate from our allies and within the US (Eisenhower for one) that this was not primarily a conflict over Communism but a civil war over nationalism, we considered it a fight against the Communists and a part of our domino theory. \n\nHowever, I have never heard of any scholar who says that the purpose of the war was to prove to the USSR that we could fight a decade long war. If I'm wrong, feel free to let me know. But I'm pretty sure I'm not. \n\n&gt; It was never about Vietnam and this is why there were no real military objectives in Vietnam.\n\nIt was always about Vietnam. For most of the time the US spent in Vietnam after the French had left, our objective was an independent and stable South Vietnam in order to balance out the Communist North. To say it wasn't about Vietnam is idiotic. \n\n&gt; If there was, the US would have rolled into Ho Chi Minh city in a week. The US won every major battle and had a 50-1 kill to death ratio. The USSR never directly attacked the US, rotted from the inside, and disintegrated shortly thereafter\n\n First, invading the north was not an objective. We were worried about Communist China intervening like they had in Korea, because hey, guess what, they share a border with North Vietnam. And Ho Chi Minh City was not a thing. Ho Chi Minh City is what Saigon was renamed after the North took the South in 1975. This is literally a google search away. \n\nWe also did bomb the North, though those operations were speckled with political correctness, poor planning, and a lack of actual direction or legitimate objective. The ideas at the time for Rolling Thunder made sense, but were terrible. \n\nThe US did win most of the major battles, as much as you want to call them victories. I don't know where he's getting the 50-1 kill ratio, if anyone knows offhand that'd be helpful. \n\nThe USSR didn't fall apart until 1991, almost 2 decades down the road. I wouldn't call that \"shortly thereafter\" by any stretch of the mind. \n\n&gt; I'm not in support of the policy, but Vietnam was a victory for the US and crushing defeat for USSR.\n\nIt was not a victory for the US, as it introduced our inability to adapt and fight a counterinsurgency, led to huge domestic upheaval at home, and has stayed in the collective consciousness as a bad thing for a long time. \n\nThis was also not a crushing defeat for the USSR. The USSR backed the eventual winner. How is that a defeat? This reasoning is nonsense. \n\nIf anyone thinks I'm wrong or has anything to add, feel free! This isn't my area of history normally, this is mostly based off the class I'm currently in. If anyone wants the books from the class and from my research paper for that class, I can provide those later once I get home. Also, if anyone wants to know the name of the prof and class I could possibly provide those, not sure how much of the personal information or privacy rules that may break though. \n\n",

        "text": "Greetings all, come ye 'round and have a sample of some very ripe low-hanging fruit. Nothing exquisite today, just example of how amusingly and alcohol-inducing those noble men who strive for White Rights can be. For in a fit of whimsy one afternoon I decided to engage a denizen of /r/whiterights just to see how far down the rabbit hole went. During the following exchange of shots -and Bacardi- I was absolutely stunned by the level of denial this fellow exhibited. I mean I knew that such folks weren't fact-friendly, but this was something else.\n\n\nOf course he based his entire argument on Africans being 'uncivilized' and 'undomesticated' on account of their tribal upbringing. So I presented the usual counters of that nonsense. The Songhai Empire, The Mali Empire, wealthy Somalian City-States that were backbone of trade in the ancient world, etc. And I kid you not, these were the exact words spoken in reply.\n\n\n&gt; *\"You pointed out a few small city states that existed for short periods of time and left almost no archeological remnants so it might has well just have been a popular warlord because these cultures apparently didn't build much of anything.\"*\n\n\n\nWell, excuse me. I suppose the [Timbuktu Manuscripts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu_Manuscripts) -not to mention Timbuktu itself- are just relics of a lowly hunter-gatherer tribe. I would mention the mother-fucking-god-damn pyramids but those are the result of Arabs of course, not the 'uncivilized' Africans. And I assume that things like [Benin City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_City) or [Somali Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_architecture#Stone_cities) don't count either. \n\n\nAnd also, to reiterate,\n\n\n\n&gt; The \"empires\" you listed mostly existed only a few centuries and none of them encompassed a large portion of Africa. \n\n\nThere you go folks. Doesn't matter how powerful your empire is or how much influence it has, if it doesn't cover half a continent or last at least five centuries it may as well be scrapping huts out of the riverbank. \n\n\n\nI know I brought this madness on myself but the depths they sink into to avoid probing obvious facts is creepy. Like when confronted with the fact that WWII and the Second Sino-Japanese war proves that other races can be just as violent as Africans, he retorts that all's well and love and war and that the Rape of Nanking is perfectly reasonable and natural. Black criminal activity in low-income neighborhoods though, that's proof of inbred savagery. \n\n\n\nAnyway there's some low-hanging fruit to poke at, please enjoy.\n\n\n\nEDIT: [For those with the liver here's the entire exchange in all of it's volcanic and somewhat psychotic glory.](http://imgur.com/a/r9lb9)",

        "text": "[The offender in question.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/340qv8/russian_history_in_5_words/cqqdouo) \n\n~~There is so much bad history here that I'm convinced the author simplifies and indulges in storytelling on purpose. Regardless, I'm going to have a crack at it.~~\n\n. . . yeah whatever, I'm just going to jump into it. \n&gt;Genghis came (in the winter, mind you) and in less than three years, the Mongols completely destroyed the young state of Rus', killing over half it's people.\n\nIt was Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, who led the incursion into Europe, not Genghis Khan. The initial incursion was in 1223 and the campaign itself was postponed due to Genghis Khan dying in 1227, thus triggering a Khan summit on the election of the next Great Khan. Furthermore, our author seems to speak of the proper mongol invasion and subsequent occupation of Rus(and here I speak of the geographical region, not whatever 'young state of Rus' the author seems to reference) which transpired from 1237 to 1240, 10 years after Genghis Khan's death. \n\n&gt;The Mongol Empire collapsed, leaving a power void in Asia. Russia reestablished itself as the Grand Duchy, and then the Tsardom, but it took a very long time before Russia could be considered a regional power.\n\nI'm not going to bother all that much with this, but he seems to suggest that Muscovy is the continuation of Rus, or rather that 'the young state of Rus' = the Grand Principality of Muscow', whereas in reality the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was viewed as the successor state to Rus for the longest of periods. I'd also like to note that, although the Mongols were by no means benevolent liege lords, they didn't pose much of an existential threat compared to entities such as the Teutonic Knights. There's a reason Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod asked the Mongols for help against the catholic crusaders - the mongols weren't prone to intervene in the cultural practices of their subjects as long as they kept paying their tributes. \n\n&gt;In the age of Empire, Russia, with no warm water ports, could not expand across the seas, and was blocked by powerful Germany/HRE/Austria in the West, so they expanded East, and the more they expanded, the more clear it was that Russia was forming an identity for itself that was somehow different from the rest of Europe. As the empire grew, it also grew more isolated. They fell behind, economically and socially. Feudalism in the form of lords and serfs existed in Russia until 1861, but when it was abolished, it only made the lower classes even poorer. In 1906 a constitution was written, but the Aristocracy rejected it.\n\nOh boy, quite the jump in time. Muscovy almost becoming a polish client-state and that guy Napoleon? Fuck that shit, irrelevant.\nI'm not sure how one would ever reach the conclusion that it was 'Germany/HRE/Austria' that kept Russia from expanding. If speaking of the Balkans and the Russo-Austrian rivalry in wake of the Ottoman decline, sure. . . but that isn't exactly 'West', is it? What hindered Russia from expanding West is, funnily enough, the nations that bordered it to the West; Lithuania/Poland-Lithuania/ the Commonwealth. The civilizations(please don't crucify me for this) of Russia/Muscovy and Poland have notoriously been the two combatants for dominance in central-eastern and eastern Europe. Russia also *did* expand West at the expense of the Commonwealth and linked up with contemporary Europe and it is through this geographical connection(through Galicia) that Russia began its modernization process. Just to reiterate: it was Poland, not 'Germany/HRE/Austria', that prevented both westward expansion and the spread of european ideas. \n\nTo add onto that, it is actually the complicity of Austria and Prussia that allowed Russia to expand westward, hence the Partitions of Poland. \nAnd just to make sure the horse is dead, and the idea of Austria and Prussia/Germany being the primary antagonists( until WW1/WW2), then it was Great Britain that primarily prevented Russia from expanding at the expense of the Ottomans, seeing as it would endanger their possessions in Egypt and India. \n\nI'm not going to touch the remainder of that quote - it is quite late and I can't be assed. I'd argue that Russia was less isolated back then, than it is now, and if anything their growth contributed to lack of said isolation, rather than added onto it. It's elite was certainly more integrated and it was an integral part of the european political order - gendarme of Europe, anyone?\n\n&gt;World War 1 began. It was kind of Russia's fault, they were the first to mobilize their military (well, they somehow managed to sneak around using the word \"mobilize\" so that after the war they could point the finger at Germany, who mobilized in response to Russia's \"totally-not-a-mobilization\") Russia was not ready for the war, the people didn't want the war, they had no stake in the squabbles of Balkan powers,\nAnd then things got worse.\nRevolution! The Tsars were kicked out in March of 1917, and were replaced by the Russian Republic.\nAnd then things got worse.\nRevolution! The Russian Republic was kicked out by the Bolsheviks in the Red October, establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, led by Vladmir Lenin. They made peace with the Germans and Austrians, and consolidated power for the next several years, socializing every business they possibly could, and then forming the USSR.\nAnd then things got worse\nLenin died, and the Communist Party was fractured into two groups, led by Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Stalin came out on top, and killed Trotsky and exiled his followers. He then began a long reign of terror. Millions of people were killed by his order. Dissidents were sent to hard labor camps in Siberia, whence they never returned.\nAnd then things got worse.\n\ni was going to continue, but after rereading this, noticing my caps lock button starting to melt steel beams, and catching myself subconsciously praying to khorne, i'm calling it a night\n\ni'll continue tomorrow, unless someone else recovers from the existential crisis incurring eye cancer above and tackles the rest of the post",

Today while procrastinating on social media, I came across [this article in the Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11562374/Britain-is-experiencing-same-decline-as-Rome-in-100BC.html#disqus_thread) promoting [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Biohistory-Jim-Penman-ebook/dp/B00U5CAVIE) by Dr Jim Penman, presumably named because his sole use in this universe, if his ideas are anything to go by, is to act as a target for all of the pens thrown at him in his lecture theatre as he regurgitates this crap.\n\nBy the way, please god will someone who is literate in biochemistry please cross post whats wrong with this scientifically to bad science because I'll do a poorer job of explaining it.\n\nLet's just discuss the description of the book first. The author seeks to explain the history of human civilisation through the bunkum \"biohistory\" theory, that biological and physiological research conducted in the 21st century into the way some people behave can give you the answer to the driving forces of every major social change in history. Or in the words of the blurb;\n\n&gt; \"Informed by significant research into the physiological basis of behaviour conducted by author Dr Jim Penman and a team of scientists at RMIT University and the Florey Institute in Melbourne, Australia, Biohistory examines how a complex interplay between culture and biology has shaped civilisations from the Roman Empire to the modern West. Penman proposes that historical changes are driven by changes in the prevailing temperament of populations, based on physiological mechanisms that adapt animal behaviour to changing food conditions. It shows how laboratory studies can be used to explain broad social and economic changes, including the fortunes of entire civilizations.\"\n\nSo in other words, all historical change in all its complexity, depth and vastness is driven by a few biological mechanisms his research has nailed, mechanisms which have somehow driven the decision making process of all of history's decision making. Apparently, all of this can be proven in a lab in the modern day, so naturally you don't need to bother yourself with, oh I don't know, existing archaeological evidence and historiography and everything else related to every major civilisation in history. This is, quite simply, awful history. It cobbles together every major civilisation and its citizenry under one framework which subsumes differences in their circumstances to a very tenuous \"scientific\" theory based on some behaviour traits amongst a group of people selected for research purposes from the 21st century. \n\nOf course, as bad as this may sound, it gets worse. How, do you ask? Well, he justifies eugenics as a solution to the terminal decline of the West, which naturally is caused by losing all of our bodily fluids.\n\n&gt; \"The author’s shocking conclusion is that the West is in terminal and inevitable decline, and that its only hope may lie with the biological sciences.\"\n\nThat's right kids, the future is dark, and if you don't go and sign up for a biology course right now, we're all going to die and YOU are at fault. Its ok though, this is based on, like, books and stuff!\n\n&gt; \"Drawing on the disciplines of history, biology, anthropology and economics, Biohistory is the first theory of society that can be tested with some rigour in the laboratory.\"\n\nNeedless to say, this is terrible historical methodology, and I suspect someone with a better knowledge of anthropology and economics could crosspost this there with a specific explanation for that or something. I'm sure this could go on badscience too. Either way, it is bad history because you *cannot* produce one catch all theory of society throughout history based on some lab work - its disputable that there could even be a complete \"theory of history\" or \"theory of society\" as it anyway, or at least its a contentious issue. Its hard to expand here for Rule 5 purposes on something that is demonstrably wrong from just thinking about it for a moment. For one thing the group of people you are using for the experiments are in no way shape or form going to represent the broad diversity of human civilisation not just culturally, but biologically. The description also notes the importance of our animal instincts and changing food conditions; has this authors experiment taken into account the differences in food conditions of every culture and civilisation he is researching? I suspect the answer is no.\n\n&gt;  \"It explains how environment, cultural values and childrearing patterns determine whether societies prosper or collapse, and how social change can be both predicted—and potentially modified—through biochemistry.\"\n\nOnce again, how are this team of biological scientists at an Australian university qualified to identify the \"cultural values\" of historical civilisations in their entirety? How can they even do so and come close to producing a reliable lab experiment anyway? The ending suggestion is that the future of human culture can be driven by biochemistry experiments, or in other words, eugenics is the answer - eugenics never worked in history and in the field of science it is rightly looked down upon.\n\n------\n\nRemarkably, that isn't even the worst of it. The Telegraph article where the author is asked for his enlightened views on the state of British civilisation is even worse - I'll be careful of Rule 2 here and resist the urge to lay into the harking back to the good old days by certain people in contemporary Britain and the West as a whole.\n\n&gt; Britain is experiencing the same decline as Rome in 100BC, with the collapse of civilisation inevitable, a scientist has warned.\n\nBritain in 2015 is, simply put, not in even remotely the same sort of global situation as the Roman Empire. It is not a hegemonic empire (why the author didn't apply this theory to the early half of the 20th century or 19th century, you ask? You'll find out later), nor does Britain now even remotely share a similar world to the Roman Empire, or culture, or just...anything substantive enough to sustain such a claim, really. We have roads, and if Game of Thrones is anything to go by we still have a hard on for swords, sex and sandals. Which obviously means that David Cameron is literally Nero, fiddling while ~~Rome~~ Tower Hamlets burns.\n\n&gt; Dr Jim Penman, of the RMIT University in Melbourne, believes Britons no longer have the genetic temperament to advance because of decades of peace and a high standard of living.\n\nThis is the most Whiggish thing to happen since Herbert Butterfield raided a wig shop naked and then covered himself in wigs while reciting famous quotes from Edmund Burke. Simply put this nonsense is based on Whiggish notions of a linear scientific \"progress\" of society yet also contradicts them because the author is a bellend; there is no evidence to suggest that since the Second World War Britain has suddenly become genetically backward or intellectually inferior compared to beforehand. Certainly, blaming peace (and to a lesser extent a higher standard of living) for the decline of Britain is ludicrous when previously, in the 19th century, peace had been a *symptom* of British *power*, not a *cause* of *lack of British power*. Likewise, his notion of how a society can \"advance\" is very subjective - are higher standards of living not an advancement? \n\nIf he purely means in the geopolitical power sense, then his theory still doesn't hold up and is based on a heavily politically weighted, bad version of recent British history dripping in \"declineology\". Britain has not become weaker because of genetic weakness or some such rubbish, its because the First World War ended the international system which had allowed Britain to retain relative hegemony in global affairs, economically and militarily, making the world more multipolar and sowing the seeds of the death of empire, and the Second World War bankrupted the British state. If genetic weakness is why Britain has declined, then how the US underwent a significant transformation towards power under the leadership of a guy who couldn't fucking walk is completely beyond me. I'd go into further depth here but would probably end up violating Rule 2.\n\n&gt; He claims that the huge success of the Victorian era will not be repeated because people in the UK have lost the biological drive for innovation. \n\nOnce again, this is completely speculative and based on no evidence. On what criteria has he judged that Britons in the 19th century all had a biological drive towards innovation? Britain was successful in that era for many reasons, and this was not one of them. Increased international trade, the lack of a competitive rival other than Russia in the Far East (a situation produced by Britain winning certain wars and paradoxically losing another), early breakthroughs and economic advantages with regards to the Industrial Revolution, the development of the legal and economic mechanisms through which important scientists could also become important businessmen and entrepreneurs, but also because of things that are completely beyond the influence of Britain's biological makeup - like its plentiful coal reserves, which were absolutely crucial to the Industrial Revolution and British naval supremacy. \n\n&gt; Instead, Britain is existing in a period similar to the decades before the fall of the Roman Republic where social tensions were rife, the gap between the rich and poor was increasing and extremism was growing. \n\nWithout straying into British politics (R2) beyond saying that you *could* apply those criteria to contemporary Britain, you could also say that about Britain for much of the last few hundred years - including the 19th century. The *governing elite*, let alone one MP famous for going to the pub a lot, were largely adhering to a system of government where they were leading a global empire that regularly used excessive military force to subdue many people bloodily, who presided over mass extreme poverty in most British cities and whose relatively moderate political beliefs for the time would in our era be considered to be on the extreme right. Social tensions were just as rife in that era on issues ranging from the claims of the Chartists to Catholic emancipation and the situation in Ireland, and the gap between rich and poor was *huge*. \n\n&gt; And when added to a growing distaste for military action, which has seen huge cuts the armed forces, by the end of the century the UK will no longer have the power, or will, to protect itself against a serious invading force, he predicts. “There are certainly parallels between 100BC in the Roman Republic where things are starting to get pretty dodgy,” he said. \n\nRome eventually took many years to collapse and existed in a completely different international environment, in a time when projecting military power like Britain could at any time in the last 200 years was slow or technologically impossible, and when Rome was beset on all sides by people who would be happy to destroy it and were not restrained by the barriers to invading Britain now or any time soon - of international law, public opinion in liberal democracies or the interdependency of the global economy - or indeed the threat of nuclear retaliation. Britain by comparison has existed in a stable sphere of the international environment compared to Europe in 100BC thanks to the impact of the Second World War and the creation of the European Union since 1945. An invasion by the USSR was never immediate threat (though nuclear war was but that was a different situation), in fact the last time Britain faced a significant threat of invasion was in 1939/1940, and that invasion would have failed badly. Britain has not fallen to foreign invasion arguably since 1688, and that was an invasion *supported by most of the standing government and not resisted by most of the population*! If anything it was a coup.\n\nIt gets really bad beyond here.\n\n&gt;  “We live in a golden age where there have been no major wars in Europe for three quarters of a century. But the economy is stagnating and we’re having fewer children. And once European countries can no longer defend themselves, the end of national independence cannot be long delayed.” \n\nIf Britain and indeed every other European country was invaded and occupied within a few years of any period of social dysfunction every time in the last few thousand years, then the world would be a very different place. \n\n&gt;  He claims that by the 19th century Christianity had driven profound social change in Britain which altered the way families behaved, children were raised and women were treated. Where previously children had largely been ignored, or beaten when they misbehaved, now they were schooled and instructed and childhood became an important part of life. Dr Penman claims it was this change which allowed the great thinkers and innovators of the Industrial Revolution to thrive. \n\nMany of the great thinkers, innovators and industrialists of the Industrial Revolution came from a wealthy background and were not genetic supermen, but very much the products of their time and access to education. The norm of \"childhood\" in Britain is more in the realm of sociology and as much as I enjoyed that A-Level I feel like I won't do this topic full justice if I go into it further. However, the idea that children went from being utterly downtrodden to suddenly having a whale of a time due to new found respect and widespread education in the Victorian era is simply wrong. For one thing, this scientist has his timeline mixed up - the Industrial Revolution was a gradual process in Britain that began in the mid to late 18th century and Georgian era, so the idea that a *Victorian* revolution in childrens education was the prerequisite to the Industrial Revolution doesn't really add up. Some of the most important names in the history of the industrial revolution were brought up in the early 18th century.\n\nIn Victorian Britain the majority of children still did not enjoy a full education and many, especially in industrial urban areas, lived in extreme poverty and had little choice but to work. Indeed in Britain, child labour helped underpin the expansion of British industry - in 1788, 143 water powered cotton mills researched in a study described two thirds of their workforce as children, and children worked in many industries. Not just chimney sweeping but glassmaking, industrial shoe polishing, mining, construction, workhouses, prostitution and household workshops. [Source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour#Victorian_era) This is just what you can find on Wikipedia from the most cursory of searches. \n\nEducation, in the early half of the 19th century, was provided mostly on a voluntary basis by charity and by Sunday schools (and even by the time of the Balfour Act at the start of the next century the church taught a third of all pupils), though by the 1860's the amount of children who were in *some* elementary education had risen. Nevertheless, [until 1870](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_Education_Act_1870), centralised education run by the state was still getting nowhere near many of Britain's children. However compulsory education from ages 5-10 was not introduced until [1880](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_Education_Act_1880) and by the end of the century the school leaving age was still no higher than 12. In short, the lives of many children in Britain in this period were *not* dominated by new access to education but by a patchwork education system and many of them were labourers. By comparison, Britain post-World War Two has had a comprehensive education system (albeit obviously not perfect) with the literacy level eventually approaching 100%. Yet modern Britain is intellectually regressed from 1850? It makes no sense. The one thing he does get right is to connect Christianity with whatever rise in education *did* happen, because it was the Church of England and its equivalents which provided a very significant chunk of and impetus to education of children throughout Britain in the 19th century.\n\nNow things get really freaky.\n\n&gt;  Christianity also promoted the importance of chastity, marriage and the nuclear family which, coupled with growing prosperity, allowed national stress levels to drop. This increase in national confidence fuelled the desire for the First World War, but the conflict set in motion a series of biological events which would lead to the beginnings of decline. \n\nI'd just like to note first that this quote is split in half in the article by an article titled \"Fall of Roman Empire caused by 'contagion of homosexuality'\", which I will leave to someone else to deal with. However, this comment just defies belief for me. **The argument here is that Britain went to war in 1914 because chastity, the nuclear family and new found national prosperity made everyone feel like they fancied shooting some Germans.** \n\nBritain went to war in 1914 because its government sought to repel the German invasion of Belgium and to prevent a single power from dominating the European continent, amongst many other things discussed many times on this sub. Britain's population on balance *were* probably more prosperous in 1914 than they had been in 1814, and the nuclear family had become a more standard family arrangement as the infant mortality rate declined. However, most of Britain's population were still very much rural or industrial working class with the middle class not yet reaching its late 20th century peak in size, they largely had substandard living standards, and there is no evidence or study I have very seen to suggest that the country received some massive boost of content that made them want to go to war with Germany. More recent cultural histories of Britain's involvement in WW1 have shown that pro-war sentiment was not universal at the outbreak of war in 1914, and in fact many people were simply curious about what would happen next. The debacle of the Boer War was recent in the memory as well. Assuming this theory is applied to the rest of Europe as well, then it completely unravels due to the causes of the conflict for other participants.\n\n&gt; “Temperament has a biological basis that changes over time defining out culture and shaping our identity right down to our DNA. It is known as epigenetics.” added Dr Penman. \n\nOr in other words, \"eugenics with bells on\". At least in this context. Anyway, now for the craziest bit of the piece.\n\n&gt; “The First world war had an epigenetic effect in that mothers made anxious by the way gave birth to an unusually aggressive generation which was the main cause of the Second World War. \n\nThe First World War was caused on Britain's part by overconfident nuclear families with their picket fences with Union Flag bunting draped everywhere, but that's not all of it folks. The Second World War was caused, if you can believe it, **by an aggressive generation of Britons/presumably Europeans because their mothers were a bit stressed by World War One.** WHAT IS THIS GUY ON. SERIOUSLY. WHAT. \n\nThe Second World War was caused, once again, by many things, namely these \"Nazi\" chaps, that had nothing to do with Mummy being a bit anxious because Kaiser Willy was waving his proverbial around at Verdun! There is no evidence to suggest that the interwar generation were violently aggressive because of the stress placed on their mothers by the First World War. Nor does it make any sense to suggest that lead to the Second World War when you take into account several things;\n\n1. The interwar British public were, for the most part, STRONGLY ANTI-WAR leading to a foreign policy designed to consolidate Britain's global position and avoid conflict in Europe at all costs, like the Ten Year Rule.\n2. There is no evidence to suggest that the combatants of World War Two, many of whom would've been born before or even just after World War One, were biologically inclined to be aggressive compared to any other generation of Britons or indeed anyone anywhere. Did baby Harold Shipman's just start popping out of wombs around the country and killing people some time around 1918?\n3. There is no evidence to suggest this has ever been the case with any generation that's mothers survived a war or similar traumatic event while pregnant. If this is the case then every child born into a conflict zone should be some sort of psychopath. \n4. On a similar note to point two, the entirety of the political class that took Britain into World War Two, and the political classes of every other country involved, would've been born well before World War One and probably entered politics before it too! \n\n&gt; “The Second World War in turn produced not only the Vietnam War but the militant anti-war students of the late 1960s.\"\n\nYes, because the Vietnam War was the only significant war after 1945 that had an observable effect on British or Western political thought. Never mind anyway because this is bollocks; the \"militant anti-war students of the late 1960s\" were produced by the embedded strength of the left in Britain and the ideological competition of the Cold War and I'm sure a historian of British culture could do a better job than I can here, but is it not incredibly contradictory to suggest World War One produced psychopaths but World War Two produced anti-war protestors?\n\n&gt; “But now we are becoming a lot less war-like and much more reluctant to fight. People no longer want to join the army, or become engineers.. And it’s not about money because these professions often pay very well. It’s because we lack the biological temperament. People would rather do arts degrees.” \n\nThe decline in the numbers of people joining the army in Britain or the West or whatever he's talking about now (he seems to be incredibly inconsistent) is probably caused by the fact that Britain has been reducing the size of its arms forces nearly constantly for about 70 years, and its global commitments have completely changed as has the nature of the modern military. Soldiers are now more professional and better paid and needed in smaller quantities. The claim that no-one wants to be an engineer anymore is incorrect as thousands of students around the country study it right now and engineering continues to appeal to many people as a field. Meanwhile other subject fields have also thrived or relatively grown exponentially in the time period in question because of the creation of new disciplines and because Britain's transformation into a service based economy requires it. Neither of these trends (and the second one isn't even a trend, its just something he's made up) have anything to do with \"biological temperament\" amongst Britain's population but rather historical economic and social processes of evolution, rather than linear \"progress\" on one hand or \"regression\" on the other.\n\nSuggesting that some people \"would rather do arts degrees\" rather than glorious engineering or STEM subjects is because they are biologically deficient is just fucking mad. Christ, I know that one or two sciences students you meet at uni will be up their own arse, but there's a difference between that and believing STEM master race **is actually a scientifically observable phenomenon**. Clearly historians do have a use though, and their use is to find people like Dr Jim Penham and hit them in the face with a brick.\n\n&gt;  Dr Penman believes Britain is now at the same point as Rome in 100BC. Despite military victories which had increased the sway of the empire throughout the western Mediterranean there was trouble brewing at home where conditions were deteriorating for the Romans. As wealth and taxes poured into the capital, the wealthy became richer still causing social tensions, political extremism and violence. Roman generals began to fight amongst themselves and by 49BC Julius Caesar had been declared dictator setting in motion a chain of events which would see the rise of Imperial Rome. Although the Roman Empire survived for a further 500 years, it was plague by civil war, unrest and political assassinations. Rome was eventually sacked by the Visigoths in 410AD. \n\nSo wait, Britain is at a point where it is not yet at the peak of its imperial power? What the fuck is this guy on? The British Empire in its most powerful form has been dead for a long time. Britain is still an important nation with global influence but I doubt we are suddenly going to start Empire 2.0, only for it to collapse because of gays, feminism and liberal arts rather than Nazis, communism and Ghandi. This last segment, for me, is just proof of the utter incoherence of this theory and the historical illiteracy of its author and probably of the person writing the article.\n\nIn conclusion, biohistory is a dumb idea, Jim Penman is a hack whose PhD in History appears to be some sort of cruel joke and the Telegraph, while not always of the highest quality despite its superb cricket coverage, has shamed itself by printing this garbage (and admittedly probably simplifying Penman's views to suit their political agenda, but nevertheless its his fault for going down this route in the first place). The following people who praised the Biohistory book on Amazon should all be given a good slap for crimes against my sanity: Dr Steven A. Peterson, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs, \nDr Michael T. McGuire, MD, Professor of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Science, Dr Frank Salter of the International Strategic Studies Association.\n\nNow to stop procrastinating with this shit and get back to work. Cheerio.\n\n",

        "text": "https://np.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/33q8v5/equality_in_literature_a_group_calling_itself/cqnuz7k?context=5\n\nSo there is a lot baked in here that might be a better fit for /r/badliterarystudies (I mean seriously, how has he never heard of Chinua Achebe or Borges?) so rather than dealing with that directly, I will just handle the claims about China.\n\n&gt;The first novel was done in Spain(Quixote).\n\nThe question of what was the first novel always induces a fair amount of mental gymnastics. *Don Quixote* is often brought up as a contender, but I tend to think that is because it is the earliest novel generally taught in a standard Western literature curriculum. The broad, general definition of a novel is something like an extended prose fictional narrative, in which case  the specific Western tradition dates back to the Hellenistic. Usually though a genre definition adds a necessity for personal, connected narrative and characters as individuals, all of which I would argue apply to *Golden Ass* but even being absurdly restrictive it is basically impossible to exclude *Tale of Genji*.\n\nWhat the statement usually means is that the literary English language novel of the eighteenth and nineteenth century has its roots in continental and particularly Spanish literature of the sixteenth century, from which Cervantes is the best example. But to use this to prove that European literature is inherently better basically is criticizing China for not writing eighteenth century English novels, which is silly. They were writing eighteenth century Chinese novels.\n\n&gt; Fourth, we invented the printing press. That is big.\n\nThis is even repeated by somebody else:\n\n&gt;The renaissance and printing press are extremely important to the development of literature, and gave Europe a huge edge in the game.\n\nRenaissance worshiping is something I see all the time and I find fairly interesting, because a lot of its nature, or at least its self perception, is baked right into the name: Rebirth. The scholars and artists of the Renaissance didn't actually think they were forging a radically new direction, by and large they viewed themselves as reviving the culture of the ancient world that was lost due to the chaos and barbarity of the Middle Ages. Even when they were behaving in quite novel ways, such as constructing the cult of the artist, they looked back to classical precursors real and perceived. It was not until later, and particularly in the courts of the New Monarchs most notably Louis XIV, that there was a widespread self fashioning of the modern period being superior to the ancient one.\n\nSo saying the Renaissance gave Europe a leading cultural edge is nonsensical, because *even when being radically novel* the Renaissance was fundamentally conservative. A good source on this is *Shock of the Ancient*, about that subsequent period.\n\nAnd, of course, a rather shockingly similar intellectual movement had occurred four centuries earlier in China. many of the philosophers of the Song felt the were rescuing the wisdom of the ancients from the accrued centuries of foreign influence, most notably Buddhism.\n\nNow of course the broader issue is with the printing press. I have heard multiple versions of to what extent it was actually an improvement over earlier and contemporary Chinese moveable type printers, so I am going to leave that aside. The bigger issue is whether this constituted a unique social development in Europe. This is frequently stated alongside claims that printing failed to start a literary revolution in China for one reason or another, usually the nature of the written language. What these fail to take into account is that printing *most definitely* started a literary revolution in China. In fact, it also lead to similar social revolutions, in particular the spread of Buddhism due in no small part to Sichuanese printing, but also something as fundamental as paper money. So even if we agree that Gutenberg's printing press was actually a major technical advance, that still does not mean that it gave Europe a distinctive cultural moment because a very similar moment had happened in China more than half a millennium earlier. This is discussed in Mark Lewis' *China's Cosmopolitan Empire*.\n\nI would also argue that historically speaking the limiting factor was not writing, but material. And where does paper come from?\n\n&gt; Third, because works from foreign languages haven't been translated, or don't translate well. IF, China lets a modern(let's not grandfather in anything over 300 years, ok?) novel out to the world, and the novel is good, will it translate well to English, and if it doesn't, should we all force ourselves to read it?\n\nViolating the twenty year rule, Mo Yan won the Nobel prize in literature three years ago. As a side note, two Chinese authors (Mo Yan and Gao Xingjian) have won in period since the last American winner (Toni Morrison).\n\nBut he said three hundred years so I will take three hundred years. First and most obvious is *Dream of the Red Chamber*, which is wonderful and written in the late eighteenth century. Shen Fu's semi-autobiographical *Six Records of a Floating Life* is from the early nineteenth century. *Flowers in the Mirror* by Li Ruzhen is mid nineteenth century. Lu Xun's many works were from the late nineteenth century. And so on. All of these are widely available in translation, even at Barnes and Noble.\n\nSo even taking the weird, arbitrary rule of only the last three hundred years, yes, there are many Chinese novels that are quite good.\n\nTo be honest, this isn't entirely his fault. Literary education is abysmal when it comes to teaching non-Western lit. In high school I remember taking a \"world literature\" class which consisted of the Bible, Zadie Smith's *White Teeth* and Nadine Gordimer's *July's People*. In my undergrad institution there is a literature requirement that can be fulfilled by taking a \"world lit\" class, which consisted of The Epic of Gilgamesh, part of the Mahabharata, Njal's saga, part of *Dream in the Red Chamber* and Chenua Achebe. Clearly there is something broken here and it needs to be fixed.\n\nBut my god, it is worth it to back down if you get called out.",

It was their first time watching it, and my oodledy millionth, and we all had a lovely time. I noticed on my bajillionth rewatching, though, that there are a few moments of bad history. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o08DOq0A8Ek&amp;feature=youtu.be), for instance. \n\nFor those not familiar with the film or who perhaps don't feel like clicking on lovely links I worked very hard to make for them, the video shows the moment when Old Biff proves to Young Biff that the Gray's Sports Almanac tells the future. He uses the November 12, 1955 game between UCLA and Washington to make his point. Despite the announcer saying that UCLA had lost, they go on to win against Washington 19-17. The announcer makes it sound like the game then immediately ends.\n\nAs I said, this is about to get really pedantic, really quickly.\n\nUCLA did, in fact, play Washington on November 12, 1955 as [this clip](http://www.efootage.com/stock-footage/54159/Ucla_Defeats_Washington_In_Close_Game_-_1955/) attests, and by all accounts, it was a thrilling game. The Washington Huskies were the underdogs (heh heh), but yet were beating the UCLA Bruins, leading them by two points as the game neared its conclusion. Jim Decker did indeed kick a field goal that then won UCLA the game, sending up great rejoicing and solidifying UCLA's place in the Rose Bowl (where they then lost to the Michigan State Spartans).

A real announcer in 1955 would not have immediately announce that the game was over when the field goal was kicked because there was still time for Washington to recover. They didn't, of course, and Old Biff is ultimately right that UCLA beats Washington 19-17, but Back to the Future is inaccurate in its depiction of how late that field goal actually comes.\n\nPedantry done.",

Let's choose [this](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clash_of_Civilizations_world_map.png) one to be standard.\n\n**Albania is more Muslim than Turkey is.** This is not only statistically wrong (Turkey is about 99% Muslim while Albania is anywhere from 30-70% because of widespread irreligion) but is historically wrong as well. Albania adopted Islam somewhat grudgingly from the Ottoman Empire for fiscal reasons and is generally less \"religious\" about alcohol consumption and observance in general. Meanwhile, Turkey is viewed as a \"lone\" country outside of the Islamic world.\n\n**The borders of civilizations are formed by religion, except when they aren't.** This is his justification for where he draws the Eastern-Western line in Europe (so Greece is Eastern but Poland is Western), but then why does he split off Catholic Latin America from Catholic Poland and Catholic/Protestant Germany? Also, it makes sense that the Muslim/African border doesn't include all Muslim-majority countries (Sierra Leone is generally speaking almost indistinguishable from Liberia in spite of being Muslim-majority) but leaving out the former Sokoto Caliphate is wrong.\n\n**Western civilization is monolithic.** Italy, politically, historically, and economically, is closer to Greece than it is to the USA as a Mediterranean, Westernized, developed EU member with a tradition of government protectionism and social democracy.\n\n**Japan is not part of the Sinosphere but Korea and Vietnam are.** Historically, Japan has undergone a lot of Chinese religious, linguistic, and political influence even if they haven't seen eye-to-eye; generally, nationalism is within civilizations, not across them. Spanish-speaking Latin American history is a tangle of ultranationalism, including wars and even [genocides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_War) among multiracial Latin Catholics, so the nationalist hate between Japan and Korea does not mean that Japan is not part of the Sinosphere (heck, look at Vietnam, which hates China too).\n\n**The Philippines is mostly Western.** If anything, it is more Latin American á la Peru/Panama (deeply Catholic but not theocratic, small mestizo and East Asian elite that controls much of the wealth) than it is Western, with the only non-Latin Western influence coming from the US occupation in the early 1900s.\n\n**Borders follow national lines, except when they don't.** How do you get Kalmykia (a Buddhist area in Russia) but not Chechnya? How do you pick up the Buddhist minority in Nepal but not the Hindu majority on Bali? Why are Guyana and Belize Caribbean but Suriname (same ethnic groups and similar geography with a vast jungle and a small, densely-populated shoreline) and French Guiana are Western because Blighty didn't colonize them? \n\nAny other suggestions as to how to improve this map?",

Jack Phillips died while Harold Bride survived by clinging on upturned lifeboat. These men were badasses and people were aware of that.\n\nSecond, while it is true that some male survivors were scorned because of surviving in place of women and children this didn't really apply to everyone and only applied to some special cases, such as White Star Line's (Titanic's shipping company) president Bruce Ismay, who jumped into the last lifeboat that launched properly and believed to be partially responsible for the disaster. (Also, while starboard side was strictly women and children (and crews in charge of the boats) only with few exceptions, port side let men in when there were no more women and children.) Just as I mentioned, Bride was praised for risking his life for his duty until the very end and he survived by clinging on the very last, upturned collapsible lifeboat which wasn't even launched. Who the hell would call him a heartless coward for that? Also, \"...were heartless and took precious resources away from women and children?\" Uh, what? This sounds like this  was written by a 13 years old.\n\nI don't know what he was trying to prove by literally making shit up. Men were being oppressed? If so, no wonder why his account was deleted long time ago.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Titanica)",

Dickwads. [-37]\n\n&gt;&gt;How is it Europes fault ? I know your going to claim foreign policy and colonism but Africa wasnt excatly a utopia before that. [26]\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Everyone loves to take the easy route and blame that colonial efforts have made Africa what it was today. When in fact, Africa's tribal mindset hasn't changed at all, and that pretty much causes a lot of problems. Compound that with the ease of access of weapons and you have a really bloody mess. [16]\n\n*************************\n\n&gt;Africa wasnt excatly a utopia before that.\n\nEven looking past the fact that a utopia has never existed, \"perfect\" is a pretty high standard to hold Africa to. At best you could try and claim that the quality of life in pre-colonial Africa was worse that that of Europe, but then you run into the problem of quantifying 'quality of life' and applying it to past civilizations.\n\nEven looking at it superficially, a majority of Europe's population were peasants who's biggest break in recent times had been the increase in available land caused by the Black Death killing so many people.\n\n&gt;When in fact, Africa's tribal mindset hasn't changed at all, and that pretty much causes a lot of problems. \n\nEmbracing the implied racism, lets assume by \"tribal mindset\" he means \"stupid people who don't even use wheels.\"\n\nSmall problem though, that \"tribal mindset\" was somehow producing walled cites and settled agriculture by the first century BCE\n\n&gt;By the first century B.C.E settled agriculture existed in West Africa. From there is spread to the equatorial forests. African farmers learned to domesticate plants, including millet, sorghum, and yams. Cereal-growing people probably taught forest people to plant grains on plots of land cleared by a method know as \"slash and burn.\" Gradually most Africans evolved a sedentary way of life: living in villages, clearing fields, relying in root crops such as yams and cassava, and fishing. **Hunting-and-gathering societies survived only in scattered parts of Africa, particularly in the central rain forest region and in Southern Africa.**^1\n\nBut sure, farming is easy enough. I bet they didn't even exploit animals like a real civilization.\n\n&gt;Between 1500 and 1000 B.C.E settled agriculture also spread southward from Ethiopia along the Great Rift Valley to present-day Kenya and Tanzania. Archaeological evidence reveals that the peoples of this region grew cereals, raised cattle, and used wooden and stone tools . . . Through out sub-Saharan Africa native peoples also domesticated donkeys, pigs, chickens, geese, and ducks.^1\n\n\"wooden and stone tools\" Checkmate!\n\n&gt;Most of Western Africa had acquired knowledge of iron-working by 250 BCE.^1\n\n\nBut they never built up cities, kingdoms, or bureaucracies. \n\n&gt;[By 400 CE] Families and clans affiliated by blood kinship lived together in villages or small city states . . . Some villages seem to have formed kingdoms. Village chiefs were responsible to regional heads, who answered to provincial governors, who in turn were responsible to a king. The chiefs ad their families formed an aristocracy . . . African kings always had religious sanction or support for their authority and were often considered divine. In this respect, early African kingship bears a strong resemblance to Germanic kingship of the same period.^1\n\n\n\n******************\n\nBut what if we looked at \"tribal mindsets\" as a crude way of saying \"non western mindsets.\"\n\nThis brings up an interesting discussion about the way people remember Imperialism and Colonialism, and one that is not specific to Africa. The physical manifestations of imperialism (burned palaces, starving Indians, handless Kongolese) are easily remembered because provide a more gripping emotional response. As a result, the social, cultural, economic, and political imperialism that took place after the European enlightenment is often not stressed or even taught.\n\nNapoleon understood this as he sailed to Egypt in 1798 with a large contingent of scientists, philosophers, artists, musicians, astronomers, architects, and engineers. To his solders he said, \"You are about to undertake a conquest, the effects of which on civilization and commerce of the world are immeasurable.\" This was, without a doubt, more than just a military conquest.\n\nSo the result of Western imperialism and colonialism was not simply the exploitation of the East (which I'm using to refer to everything that is south and east of Europe); rather, it marked the creation of a Western-centric world order that still survives to this day. To survive in this new world the East had to rebuild their societies from the ground up with only an example set by the West, often while defending from further exploitation from them. Facing the tasks of creating a national or pan-ethnic identity (often with borders spanning multiple religious, linguistic, and ethnic groups), overturning the existing economic structures that were either obsolete in the face of the modern world or placed there by the west to exploit, creating a fair political system in the face of challenges from ant-western and culturally conservative forces, and as Nehru said, \"do [it] in fifteen years.\", it's no wonder that any instant successes of these patchwork societies were exceptions to the rule.\n\n&gt;Many [Eastern] thinkers judged Western-style politics and economics to be inherently violent and destructive forces. They knew that borrowing technical skills through a modern system of education from Europe wasn’t enough; these borrowings brought with them a whole new way of life. They demanded an organized mass society whose basic unit was the self-reliant individual who pursues his economic self-interest while progressively liberating himself from guild rules, religious obligations and other communal solidarities—a presupposition that threatened to wreck the old moral order.^2\n\nIt's important to recognize that the post-colonial world has not been \"catching up\" to the West. This is not a race that was destined to happen. Nor can you call it 'progress' without first conceding the total superiority of Western Modernity. Eastern 'progress' is just slow and painful movement towards a goal we forced on the world and have yet to seriously question.\n\nAs we move forwards, the problems brought on by western modernity are becoming more apparent. Hopefully the idea of Sid Myers like progress will start to go away soon.\n\nI do feel like it's worth pointing out that many of these trends, from the unstable expectation gap brought on by democracy to the rabid materialistic and utilitarian culture untempered by spiritual or moral forces, were recognized by Eastern thinkers as they were forced to deal with the reinvention of their societies.\n\nI'll end on a great quote from *The Ruins of Empire*:\n\n&gt;The war on terror has already blighted the first decade. In retrospect, however, it may seem a mere prelude to greater and bloodier conflicts over precious resources and commodities that modernizing as well as already modern economies need.\n\n&gt;The hope that fuels the pursuit of endless economic growth—that billions of consumers in India and China will one day enjoy the lifestyles of Europeans and Americans—is as absurd and dangerous a fantasy as anything dreamt up by Al Qaeda. It condemns the global environment to early destruction, and looks set to create reservoirs of nihilistic rage and disappointment among hundreds of millions of have-nots—the bitter outcome of the universal triumph of Western modernity, which turns the revenge of the East into something darkly ambiguous, and all its victories truly Pyrrhic.\n\n********************\n\n1.

Wow. Even hardened Marxist-Leninists normally throw their hands up and admit that the Great Leap Forward was a monumental failure, but not this person.\n \nHowever, as we all know it is not always good to judge the actions of people from the past through the moral prism of the present, so perhaps it is just my evil capitalist-roader prejudices that have lead me think that millions of dead people are a bad thing. Perhaps I needed to look at what the Great Leap Forward sought to achieve and see if they would have judged it a success by the goals of regime that implemented it.\n \nThe goals were to:\n \n1. Increase industrial output\n2. Increase agricultural production\n \nLooking at industrial output it is not a straight fail, as to begin with iron production did increase. This is because Mao encouraged the establishment of small backyard furnaces to produce steel. There was no way that they could produce actual steel, but what they could do was melt down good quality steel tools, and turned them into poor quality pig iron. Hence the increase in the production of iron. However, they eventually started to run out of tools to melt and even the iron production dropped to below where it had started.\n \nHardly a good start, but did agricultural production increase?\n \nNope. It shrank, because the agricultural policies they were trying to implement were bat-shit insane. The resulting famine killed at least 18 million people. Now, to be fair to the kill crazy Communists not all of these people actually died of starvation. At least a couple of million people were beaten to death before hunger got them, but that can still not be called a success by any stretch of the imagination and even the CCP knew that it was not.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/33kuap/pius_xii_congratulated_francoso_how_is_that_bad/",
        "text": "**Introduction**\n\nLet me start this post by stating that I have the utmost respect for Hugh Thomas, Paul Preston, Stanley Payne, Antony Beevor, and the other historians of the Spanish Civil War.  They each deal with this complex and sometimes delicate topic with skill, talent, and diligent research.  I would recommend their books without reservation to anyone looking into the subject of the Spanish Civil War.  That would include how these authors treat today’s subject:  Pius XII’s congratulatory message to Franco on April 14, 1939 (a link will be proved below, but I would like to discuss some other aspects of this subject first).\n\nEach of the authors listed above deals with this incident in a similar manner:  briefly.  Almost universally this item is included as a sentence or two near the end of the section that describes how the Spanish Civil War came to a close.  Here is Beevor’s selection, which I believe references a different message than will be addressed in the rest of this post:\n\n&gt;On March 31 Franco’s armies reached their ultimate objectives. ‘Lifting our hearts to God,’ ran Pope Pius XII’s message of congratulation to Franco, ‘we give sincere thanks with your excellency for the victory of Catholic Spain.’ \n\n[This link should take you to the Google Books entry confirming the above](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-mayoYS6eIC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=beevor+pius+xii+congratulates+franco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wtjV_6VYoD&amp;sig=_GpGRnO_ma1M7ISoG7S0nPcu10E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TnAmVcjoMcTmsAX0r4H4Cg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=beevor%20pius%20xii%20congratulates%20franco&amp;f=false)\n\nAnother favored quote is this one from the opening of the pontiff’s message:\n\n&gt;With great joy We address you, most dear children of Catholic Spain, to express to you our fatherly congratulations for the gift of peace and of victory, with which God has deemed worthy to crown the Christian heroism of your faith and charity, tried in so many and so generous sufferings\n\n[Reference Preston’s passage at the bottom of this page](https://books.google.com/books?id=2vioVIdend4C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=preston+pius+xii+franco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jB9UH3ZCk_&amp;sig=wjJRBco9_gPS5-cY1dEV9HpNjUw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JN4vVY2CLcOfNp7XgMAN&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=preston%20pius%20xii%20franco&amp;f=false)\n\nPreston and others tie Pius XII’s “great joy” with later developments in which concessions were both gained and granted by Franco and the Church.  This is generally part of an overall narrative that places the Catholic Church as a staunch supporter of Franco’s efforts and his eventual postwar regime.  The rest of the linked paragraph illustrates this clearly, as Preston argues that Catholics worldwide rallied to Franco’s banner.\n\nSo you are probably asking yourself, “so how is this bad history?”  Well, I must admit that the message did take place.  The above quotes are accurate in all respects.  Most of those who identified as Catholic in Spain did side with Franco’s forces.  Pius XII did indeed send congratulatory messages to Franco.  The Catholic Church gained a great deal of power over many aspects of life in Spain after the Spanish Civil War.  None of these facts are disputed.\n\n**But**\n\nHistory isn’t just about facts, it’s about how those facts are interpreted.  So I will not be saying that Beevor and Preston and the others are *wrong*, only that they lack nuance in how they chose to relay the facts.  Preston in particular has a pro-Republican bias.  That is not an awful thing, as the excellence of his scholarship outweighs the few flaws in his presentation.  \n\nSo let’s take a moment and examine the linked page that I do find to be problematic.  The paragraph that begins on the previous page rightly points out that Cardinal Gomá fully backed Franco’s cause, and that the letter he organized did indeed assist in making the argument that Franco’s cause and Catholicism was the same.  Now on the page that I directly linked to Preston correctly cites that German bishops backed Franco’s cause as well.  In the U.S., Father Coughlin did extol the virtues of the Nationalists and led a campaign that contributed to the U.S. refusing to intervene directly in Spain.  The particulars of Vatican recognition are correct as well, and the British Cardinal Hinsley did send that message to Franco.\n\nSo what’s the problem?  Well, Gomá hardly spoke for any member of the Catholic hierarchy outside of Spain.  Gomá (as Preston points out) couldn’t even get all of the Spanish hierarchy to sign on to his ideas.  The German bishops did make their statement, but these were hardly mainstream Catholic views either (Catholicism in Germany has always been just a little bit *different*, and these differences persist to this day).  Regarding Vatican recognition of Franco’s Nationalists, we have to look at the timeline to fully understand what happened.  The Vatican did send an unofficial envoy in August of 1937 as Preston asserts, but the war began more than a year before that date.  If it took a year for an unofficial envoy to be named and nearly two years for an official representative to be named, I don’t think that can be put forward as a grand Vatican endorsement for Franco’s regime.  \n\n[Father Coughlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin)—the famed ‘radio priest’—is an interesting case.  Increasingly, Coughlin praised Hitler and Mussolini and made highly insensitive comments about Jews—including reproducing the detestable and fictional *Protocols of the Elders of Zion* in his publications as fact.  He was also a vocal opponent of FDR, and 1936 was an election year.  1936 was also the year that Cardinal Eugenio [Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) visited the U.S.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Pacelli's_1936_visit_to_the_United_States), and he met with FDR as well as touring the country and meeting Catholic officials (lay and ordained).  Historians John Cornwell (*Hitler’s Pope*) and David G. Dalin (*The Myth of Hitler’s Pope*) don’t agree on much of anything about Pius XII, but both point out that Pacelli’s visit from October to November of 1936 was directly tied to silencing Coughlin (with the possibility of that being in exchange for U.S. diplomatic recognition of the Vatican).  When Cornwell and Dalin agree that the Vatican wanted Coughlin off the air and that the US hierarchy above Coughlin’s superior also wanted him silenced it becomes problematic at best to cite Coughlin as an exemplar of U.S. attitudes on Franco.  \n\nSo in these cases we can see that Preston’s facts are 100% correct, but the way that he arranged them is slightly misleading as to the reality of the situation.\n\n**Why?**\n\nSo if Preston and Beevor are such great scholars (and they are), why do they get this wrong?  In part I think we can blame it on their individual bias slipping into their work.  It happens to all of us, including myself (and likely in this post someone could point out a number of such instances).  But I don’t think that’s the totality of the cause or even the majority of the cause.  I think that these scholars lack experience in speaking Vaticanese.\n\nYou’re right, that’s not a real word.  A favorite professor of mine made it up.  He made up ‘papalese’ too ([and I wrote about it more than a year ago](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kflnk/theory_thursday_professionalacademic_history/cbomn53), in fact).  Why?  (you might ask, again)  Well, popes speak in a way that is peculiar, and the closest secular parallel is diplomatic language.  Most heads of state might speak on two levels at the same time, one for domestic consumption and another for foreign interests.  That is a delicate line to walk, and there is specialized language that applies in a different way than it does in normal discourse.  If someone says that their neighbor committed “an unfriendly act,” I think most of us would presume that the neighbor was playing their music too loud or is being difficult regarding the parking situation.  If the U.S. Ambassador tells a country that they have committed “an unfriendly act,” the presumption is that the bombers have been prepositioned and that they could be overhead in short order.  Same words, different meaning.  \n\nPopes are usually speaking on a *lot* more levels at the same time.  They share a concern for how foreign parties might react to what they are saying, but as pope they have less to worry about their internal constituency (but that aspect still can exist on some level) because they are not up for reelection.  However, in that same speech they are likely to be addressing more than one (or all) of the following:\n\n* The present theological debate(s) on whatever issue(s) is/are at hand\n* Providing commentary on past theological statements\n* Charting a path for the future that the pontiff thinks should be either pursued or avoided\n* Pointing out the advantages or shortcomings of an ideology, philosophy, practice, or personal choice/action\n\nThere is also specialized language.  The words “Tradition” and “tradition” do *not* mean the same thing.  If a word is capitalized (such as Salvation, Redemption, Reconciliation, or others) there is often a very specific thing that the pope is referring to.  He is usually also addressing the past, the present, and the foreseeable future in a single comment.  So when the above historians take a quote from Pius XII or another pontiff, they can easily miss a lot of the context around it.  Combining that with a bias that can range from slightly against Catholicism to rabidly against Catholicism (depending on the author in question) and you have the recipe for historians (and others) to misunderstand what a pontiff is saying in a particular quote while still being 100% accurate.\n\nSo, where does that leave us?",

The US did the same thing to Mexico and no one complains about that. We won a war so we took the land.\n\nI think the [Brown Berets](http://nationalbrownberets.com/Aztlan.html) and other chicano nationalists would probably disagree. Violently.\n\n\n&gt; At some point the native Americans had to come to the realization that they couldn't hold onto the past forever and would be better off just to join the modern world. They could have bartered and gotten every tribe enough land to be rich farmers but instead they resisted the modern world and lost it all. -[/u/nuck_forte_dame](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/334r8b/til_a_boy_was_scalped_by_a_sioux_chief_little/cqhtx5c)\n\nI don't think it's possible to adequately convey how utterly insulting and dismissive this statement is. Native Americans were not backwards savages! They had political institutions, culture, trade, and cities. Some had institutionalized warfare and dedicated warriors. Many of the first nations *were* prosperous agricultural societies before they were forced off the most valuable farmland. Even those groups that did cooperate with invading powers often found themselves betrayed when their resources were taken for settlers. This is exactly what happened to the Haudenosaunee, the Lakota, the Hopi, Ojibwe, Navajo, O'odham, Western Apache, Cahuilla, Paiute, S'Klallam, Chimakum, Skokomish, ...\n\n&gt; This is what I find so ridiculous: everyone pretends like while the entire rest of the world, for all of recorded history, was warring with one another; somehow, in the Americas, everyone was peaceful. Then came the Europeans and introduced savagery. - [/u/dumsubfilter](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/334r8b/til_a_boy_was_scalped_by_a_sioux_chief_little/cqhso2h)\n\nWhile this position is wrong, it's also entirely a strawman. No one qualified to speak on the matter has that view of the precolumbian Americas. It's also equally wrong to pretend that Europeans were not a massive and fundamental shift in the political landscape of the Americas. Entire cultural groups had simply *vanished*. Trying to deflect the culpability of Europeans and Americans for their actions is disgusting on every level.\n\n&gt;&gt; That said, the ensuing enslavement and attempts at genocide were completely unnecessary and absolutely awful.\n&gt; You mean practices that Native Americans also committed in the pre-Columbian era?\nNative Americans wiped out tribes and cultures, practiced enslavement, and had cannibalism as well in the Pre-Columbian era. -[/u/hostile65](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/334r8b/til_a_boy_was_scalped_by_a_sioux_chief_little/cqiaz48)\n\nIt's impossible to express how utterly idiotic this argument is. Precolumbian slavery was vastly different than American slavery, inasmuch as the term can be applied before European arrival. In some groups (notably the Western Apache and the O'odham) the exchange of slaves and brides was a institutionalized in a way that only bears the loosest resemblance to slavery. In other groups like the Aztecs, slaves were a special type of property, to be disposed of at their noble's whim. Cannibalism as an activity was incredibly rare across the Americas. The trope of cannibal tribes routinely feasting on the scalps of their enemies was never the norm in the Americas. Most groups instead held it as a semi-religious activity and for reasons for practicality, did not live on human flesh. What occurred in the colonial period was distinct in every possible way. \n\n&gt; Yes but there were very few cultures in the Old World that practiced human sacrifice, and none on the scale or with the fervor that New World civilizations like the Maya and Aztec did -[/u/ArguingPizza](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/334r8b/til_a_boy_was_scalped_by_a_sioux_chief_little/cqicb67)\n\nI'd simply like to link Michael Coe's excellent review, [*Struggles of Human History*](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/199/4330/762) in which he notes the similarities between Mesoamerican cannibalism and the Eucharist. The bloodthirsty Aztec trope is much more a figment of the colonial period than the reality of the Triple Alliance.\n\n&gt; As a whole, North American tribes did not claim land. Nearly all of them were migratory. Yes, some had actual lodges, but most did not.\n\nWhere do people get this damn idea? Are the [gigantic buildings](http://www.airphotona.com/stockimg/images/16671.jpg) littering the landscape not enough? What about [tax records](http://publicdomainreview.org/files/406px-Codex_Mendoza_folio_37r.jpg)?  [Castle-homes](http://www.arizonaruins.com/afnm/baby_images/Baby0L.jpg)?

Imagine being an Indian and seeing a rifle be fired for the first time in history and wrapping your brain around what just happened. Or getting steel needles for the first time. -[/u/dumsubfilter](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/334r8b/til_a_boy_was_scalped_by_a_sioux_chief_little/cqhwrnz)\n\nAmazingly, many groups did have metal needles in Meso- and South America. Even the Hohokam of what is now Arizona had numerous copper bells. The cities of Chalchihuites and Yautepec are both well recorded as not only having Bronze/Copper needles, but that they were so common as to be utilitarian. I lost my picture of the Yautepec excavation, so hopefully this [nice picture](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-6/626_02_2.jpg) of various needles will be a sufficient replacement.\n\nHonestly, I can't continue with this breakdown. There's too much wrong in too many comments on too many levels.\n\nGood luck, brave thread-delvers.",

        "text": "Tomorrow is one of the most famous anniversaries in American history. As such I thought I'd some preemptive debunking of myths that are sure to pop up.\n\nOn April 18th, 1775 Paul Revere set out on the ride that would be immortalized by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow almost a century later. On April 19th, 1775 the militia of Massachusetts fought a running battle with the British forces that lasted most of the day and covered the route from Boston to Concord. This battle has been mislabeled as the Battle of Lexington &amp; Concord, when the fiercest fighting took place in Menotomy, and Lexington &amp; Concord were actually minor skirmishes in the whole affair. \n\nNow on to the myths!\n\n1.) American militia were a disorganized mob that fought individually with their own initiative. This is a common view that owes it's origins mostly to British reports after, and then national pride later as the image of the simple farmer taking down his musket to fight tyranny became idealized. \n\nThe truth of the matter is different. David Hackett Fischer points out that during the battle American militia faced off against British forces at least six times in formation. British reports state that they were swarmed by men, but not in groups larger than 50. 50 is almost exactly the size recommended by the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for militia companies, which indicates that the militia responded in company sized units and fought under the direction of their captains. \n\nJohn R. Galvin points out that the militia were organized and directed to form a sort of circling force of the British. Companies would arrive and would be directed as to where to go to make sure that the British were under constant fire from both sides and the rear. \n\n2.) The Revolutionary War started because of attempts at gun control. This one is just plain silly for several reasons:\n\n* The orders given by Gage *specifically* stated that private property was to be left untouched (of course after the fighting started soldiers began looting). \n\n* At no point during the search in Lexington or Concord were private homes searched for private weapons. Homes *were* searched for the munitions and stores, but that's something else entirely. \n\n* Concord was a major supply depot of war materiel. The Mass Provincial Congress had made plans to outfit and supply an army of 15,000 men, and had been gathering supplies to do so. The supplies were split into two main depots. The larger one was at Worcester, and the other one was at Concord. Here are some of the materials that were stored at Concord: \n\n* * 10 tons of musket balls/cartridges\n\n* * 35 half-barrels of powder\n\n* * 350 tents\n\n* * 14 med chests\n\n* * 80 barrels of beef\n\n* * 8 1/2 tons salt fish\n\n* * 17 1/2 tons rye\n\n* * 318 barrels flour\n\n* * 100 barrels salt\n\n* * 20 bushels oatmeal (a little small considering the captain of the Concord militia grew oats)\n\n* * plus all sorts of other camp things like shovels, candles, etc. \n\nIn addition to all these supplies there were four brass cannon that had been stolen from Boston right under the British noses (literally--they were taken in broad daylight while there were soldiers on guard), two brass mortars, and at least three iron cannon. \n\n3.) Dr. Joseph Warren had a high level informant within the British camp. This one has been speculated about for awhile, but I particularly blame David Hackett Fischer for this one, as he comes directly out and claims that Margaret Gage was passing information to Warren. Then the \"History\" Channel's Sons of Liberty takes it a step further and claims that Margaret Gage &amp; Warren were having an affair (didn't realize that my April Fool's Day post had been taken seriously. \n\nThere's no evidence that there was even a high level source needed, as it was common knowledge on the street that the British would eventually be going after the supplies.  when the British ships started lowering boats to transport troops across the Mystic River to begin their march, he called for Revere in \"much haste\" (according to Revere's account) and told Revere to go rouse the militia. \n\nMore debunking of the high level informant myth can be found [here](http://allthingsliberty.com/2014/04/dr-joseph-warrens-informant/).\n\n4.) The whole idea of \"Paul Revere's Ride\". It should really be called \"Paul Revere, William Dawes, Samuel Prescott, and a whole bunch of people from the city who were travelling at night\" ride. Of course this myth is all Longfellow's fault because of his catchy poem. The truth is that Dawes was sent out first, because Warren was aware of increased activity and wanted to let Hancock &amp; Adams know. At that point Warren didn't know for sure that the British force would be heading out. Later the British started to unload boats to transport the troops across the Mystic River, at which point Warren summoned Revere with \"much haste\" and told Revere to go raise the alarm. \n\nNeither man made it to Concord. In addition to Revere and Dawes there was Dr. Prescott who was out late returning from visiting his fiance. He joined the two men and was instrumental in raising further alarms. There were also a whole host of other travelers on the road that night. \n\nDawes left on his journey about 8pm, Revere about 10pm. The Lexington militia actually received word about a possible British march around 7 or 8 pm and even called out the militia, who waited around for awhile and then dispersed, waiting for further news. \n\n Info on the timeline of Revere's and Dawes rides can be found [here](http://allthingsliberty.com/2014/04/dissecting-the-timeline-of-paul-reveres-ride/).\n\n5.) The militia units were a poorly trained rabble. The origins of this myth lie with the British officers contempt of the way that MA militia did drill and dressed. While the militia certainly didn't look like British soldiers, they actually trained from the same sources. Each militia commander was in charge of training his militia, and most of them used British manuals to do so. In the months leading up to the fighting on April 19th, militia units were meeting as much as 3 or 4 times a week to drill--especially the minute companies. \n\nGalvin points out that the MA militia at this time was probably the best trained in America. Fischer points out that maybe up to 1/3rd of the militia may have had fighting experience in the French &amp; Indian War.\n\n6.) The British soldiers were crack soldiers with years of experience. \n\nDon Hagist mentions that the British Army in America was essentially a peace time army. Even though many of the British soldiers in America had been with the army for years, that didn't indicate service during the Seven Years' War or the French &amp; Indian War.\n\nThe soldiers who were sent on this mission had never worked with each other before. The strike force was composed of grenadiers and light infantry from several different units, serving under a commander they weren't familiar with. Also several officers attached themselves to the force as volunteers, confusing things even further. So the British command structure was confusing in addition to the lack of comfort with each other. \n\n7.) One of the targets of the British raid was the capture of John Hancock and Samuel Adams, who were staying in Lexington. This was certainly the fear of Dr. Warren (who was in charge of the Boston Committee of Safety intelligence operations), but again, the orders given by Gage don't mention Hancock or Adams at all. \n\n8.) The American militia was so successful against the British in the fighting because Americans were sharpshooters using rifles. \n\nThe fact is, rifles were extremely rare in MA, and the militia were armed with a wide variety of weapons. It's highly unlikely that there were any rifles on the field that day at all. The most common weapon on both sides was likely the Brown Bess, simply because of the numbers of Brown Bess muskets that had been decommissioned from the French &amp; Indian War, plus of course the weapons being used by the British were also almost all Brown Bess muskets.\n\nMatthew Spring talks about the differences in British shooting vs American. He points out two factors that made a key difference during engagements. The first is that the American soldiers &amp; militia often double or triple loaded their muskets. They'd put one large ball in with two smaller ones, essentially turning it into an upgraded shotgun. The other key factor was the flints used by American forces which were of a superior grade to British flints. This meant fewer misfires and longer usage before needing to replace the flints. \n\n9.) The British soldiers were at a disadvantage because they relied on marching in straight rows, making them easy targets. This is a particularly bad bit of history, *especially* for the fighting on April 19th. During the retreat Colonel Francis Smith organized his force so that the grenadiers marched in the rear and the light infantry acted as skirmishers. This meant that the light infantry companies would range alongside the road, clearing out enemy forces that got too close. This proved particularly deadly at Menotomy, where some of the bitterest fighting of the whole retreat took place.\n\nIn addition, British tactics in North America were decidedly different than what were used elsewhere. They adapted their tactics to the terrain, and used the terrain to their advantage. This is especially true of the light infantry companies.\n\n10.) Paul Revere shouted \"The British are coming\" galloping through the streets of the towns of militia. This image also goes back to Longfellow, as well as to subsequent film &amp; tv about the event. The truth is that Revere didn't just wildly gallop through town. He stopped at prominent local leaders and then moved on to the next town. The local leaders then roused the militia and sent out riders to towns further out. Those riders contacted leaders in those towns, who sent out further advanced riders, etc. We don't know the words he actually used, but \"redcoat\" wasn't a popular term at the time (though it wasn't unheard of). It was likely \"The regulars are out\", or \"The army is marching\" or words to that effect. \n\nSources:\n\n[With Zeal and With Bayonets Only: The British Army on Campaign in North America, 1775–1783](http://www.amazon.com/With-Zeal-Bayonets-Only-Commanders/dp/0806141522) by Matthew Spring\n\n[The Minute Men: The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution](http://www.amazon.com/Minute-Men-Realities-American-Revolution-ebook/dp/B0077IRM7W) by John R.

        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/32su8i/bitcoin_is_the_worlds_most_dangerous_idea/cqe9x6w\n\n&gt; [–]KoKansei 55 points 7 hours ago \n\n&gt;Just another article that demonstrates how powerful the extended metaphor of the modern state/bureaucracy as medieval clergy really is.\nI can't even imagine how someone who saw the awesome potential of double-ledger bookeeping back in the 13th century, when it was literally considered \"heresy,\" must have felt.\n\n*R5 tl;dr: Double entry accounting was never \"literally heresy\". What the church disliked was usury.*\n\n**On Usury**\n\nUsury means charging interest. It's in Deuteronomy 23:19-20* \"Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother: interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest. Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.\"*, and in many other versicles of both the old and the new testment.\n\nThe catholic church was against usury from the start. The First Council of Nicaea forbade the clergy from engaging in usury. In the beggining of the 12th century, the 3rd Lateran Council decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor christian burial. Later, Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury a heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation which allowed it. \n\nThe thing is, these restrictions only applied to the catholics. The jewish interpretation of the scriptures allowed them to charge interest, as long as they are lending money to a non-jew. And the theological view of the church did nothing to reduce the demand for banking services such as money exchange or loans. From the void of banking services and the desire to stay faithful to Church doctrine arose the niche of economic opportunity for the Jews. The first modern banks were merchant banks. The italian jews could not hold land, so they would lend money to farmers against the crops in the fields, a high risk loan that catholics could never provide due to the church laws against usury. Eventually they started to provide other financial services, like advancements and underwriting. \n\nUsing the Jews for money services did not go against theology.  No sin was committed by letting the Jews do usury, as Jews’ \"souls were probably lost in any case\" and Jewish presence could be tolerated for the benefit of extracting their taxes. Furthermore, the papacy was cognizant of the fact that Judaism did not consider it sinful to take interest. As Frederick II of Sicily noted, usury was “not illicit for them.” Therefore the Jews were able to supply labor for an industry blocked to Christians as per the influence of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe papal influence and control of the money services of Jews continued even after it was deemed permissible for Jews to undertake acts of usury. Jewish moneylending and exchange services began in Rome as least as early as the beginning of the twelfth century, with the catholic pilgrims who were in need of currency exchange. Other pilgrims sought loans so that they could offer indulgences. The papacy used the Jews for the transfer of money, in addition to some occasional loans from Jewish moneylenders — though the papacy would never openly admit to such a reliance on the Jews. The practice of employing Jewish moneylenders spread from Rome to other cities and a significant rise in the number of Jewish moneylenders occurred during the second half of the twelfth century.\n\nThis doesn't mean that catholics never practiced banking. Outlawing usury did not prevent investment, but stipulated that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Usury was to simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture. In other words, to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that *\"to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural\"*. St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges. The Catholic Church, in a decree of the 5th Lateran Council, expressly allowed such charges in respect of credit-unions run for the benefit of the poor known as \"*montes pietatis*\".\n\nAlso, there were plenty of catholics looking for theological loopholes in order to charge interest. For instance, in the middle of the 13th century, groups of italian christians, particularly the Cahorsins and Lombards, invented legal fictions to get around the ban on Christian usury. It was not forbidden to take collateral on loans, so pawn shops thus operate on the basis of a contract that fixes in advance the 'fine' for not respecting the nominal term of the 'interest free' loan, or alternatively, may structure a sale-repurchase by the 'borrower' where the interest is implicit in the repurchase price.\n\nThe christians effecting these legal fictions became known as the pope's usurers, and reduced the importance of the jews to european monarchs. Later a distinction evolved between things that were consumable (such as food and fuel) and those that were not, with usury permitted on loans that involved the latter. The Medici bank used a system of bills of exchange that was legal according to the majority of theologians.\n\n**On Bookkeeping**\n\nBookkeeping started while society was still in the barter and trade system rather than a cash and commerce economy. Ledgers from these ancient times were kept in narrative form, with dates and descriptions of the trades made or services rendered. These transactions were kept in individual ledgers, and could provide proof in case of a dispute. This system is terribly inneficient and tiresome, but worked in small volumes or for personal ledgers. \n\nThe bookkeeping art really developed during the 13th century among merchants, traders and clothmakers of Florence. Their business showed a high degree of continuity from year to year (in contrast to those of Venice and Genoa, which were concentrated on separate trading ventures), and they were carried on by stable partnerships, who needed to ascertain and divide profits and share deductions from time to time. These partnerships were short lived, being wound up and reformed every 4 or 5 years, and the assets and liabilities transfered to a new book. Sadly, there are very few surviving books from this time, because there was very little interest in preserving the old books once the new ones were opened, and parchment was very expensive.\n\nThe first set of books kept in double entry that survived until today are the books of Rineri Fini &amp; Brothers (1296-1305) and of Giovani Farolfi &amp; Co. (1299-1300). Both set of books are from florentine merchant firms operating in France. Of these two, the Farolfi books are closed by means of a balance account. These books however contain several erros of principle and arithmethics, which indicates that the proper yearly profit or loss was found by a refinement of single entry methods, and thus these books were in fact kept in 'quasi-double-entry'.\n\nEventually, double-entry bookkeeping was properly developed and spreaded among Tuscany, and eventually, Italy. The first record of a complete double entry is the Messari accounts of the Republic of Genoa in 1340. By the end of the 15th century, even merchants in Lubeck used the double entry system.\n\nLuca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar, published in 1494 the *Summa de arithmetica, geometria. Proportioni et proportionalita*, a textbook written in the vernacular which includes a description of the bookkeeping practices of Venetian merchants during the renaissance, including double-entry bookkeeping. for this book he is considered the Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nDouble-entry bookkeeping was not an heresy. Jewish money lenders operated with the approval of the church and the catholic kings, catholics also operated as bankers, especially in the 14th century Italy, where double entry bookkeeping developed and was adopted by catholic entities like the Medici bank and the Republic of Genoa. The \"Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping\" and author of the first published work on double-entry system of bookkeeping, Luca Pacioli, was a franciscan friar. No accountant was burned at the stake for the way they kept their books.\n\nSources:\n\n* Lee, Geoffrey Alan. The Development of Italian Bookkeeping 1211-1300\n* Poliakov, Léon.

The [Constitution of the Confederate States of America](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp) mentions slaves or slavery 10 times. I will briefly summarize each mention below.\n\nArticle I, Section 2, Paragraph 3: Slaves will be counted as 3/5ths of a person for the purposes of apportioning representation and taxes.\n\nArticle I, Section 9, Paragraph 1: The African slave trade remains prohibited.\n\nArticle I, Section 9, Paragraph 2: Congress can ban the import of slaves from territories external to the Confederacy.\n\nArticle I, Section 9, Paragraph 4: No law impairing the right of property in Negro slaves shall be passed.\n\nArticle IV, Section 2, Paragraph 1: The citizens of the CSA will have the right to travel and live in any state in the Confederacy, and be granted the rights granted to all Confederate citizens while within the borders of the Confederacy, including the right to their property in slaves which shall not be impaired.\n\nArticle IV, Section 2, Paragraph 3: No slave can be discharged from their labor by escaping and must be returned to their owner. (2 uses of the word slave)\n\nArticle IV, Section 3, Paragraph 3: In the event of expansion of the Confederacy's borders, the right to slavery will be extended into all territory claimed by the Confederacy. (2 uses of the word slave)\n\nWith that said, it is possible to amend the Confederate Constitution to allow emancipation, through Article V -- but nowhere in that document is there any mention of freeing the slaves. Period.\n\nFor bonus points, [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/32pdov/150_years_ago_today_this_patriot_passed_away/cqdbyik) is the entire thread that includes misunderstanding of Lincoln's suspension of habeus corpus, debate on the definition of the word patriot, and /u/recreational fighting the good fight against garbage history.",

By the time that Emily Davison died, in 1913, 56% of the adult male population in the UK had the right to vote. The suffragette movement were campaigning specifically for equal voting rights for women, not for universal suffrage.\n\n&gt; chartists were hung, were shot, were convicted of high treason, were sentenced to hard labour, and led the last armed rebellion against the state in this country, so you could have the right to vote. they died at the battle of peterloo, in the newport uprising, were killed for the cato street conspiracy, so you could have the right to vote. \n\nI studied British political reform in the 19th century for A-Level, including all of the events mentioned here, and when I first came across this post I had to look them all up to make sure I wasn't misremembering things. Because this is impressively wrong.\n\n* The Cato street conspiracy was in 1820.  The Peterloo Massacre was in 1819.  The first People's Charter wasn't until 1838, and the Chartist National Convention wasn't until 1839.  The Newport Rising (not, usually, uprising) *was* associated with the Chartist movement, so they got that right, at least.\n\n* No chartists were hung after the Newport Rising.  The leaders were sentenced to transportation for life for high treason, and an estimated 22 were killed in the fighting. (Actually, three were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, but their sentences were commuted after nationwide petitioning). Nor, as far as I can tell, were any sentenced to hard labour.\n\n* No one was hanged, convicted of treason, or sentenced to hard labour in the aftermath of the Peterloo Massacre.\n\n* Describing Peterloo as a \"battle\" is grossly misrepresenting the facts.  It was always intended to be a peaceful protest, and Hunt, the speaker, said that people should be \"armed with no other weapon but that of a self-approving conscience\". \n\n* The Cato Street Conspirators weren't suppressed due to their campaigning for universal suffrage.  They were planning to overthrow the government and assassinate the cabinet.  There is a subtle difference.  (To be fair to them, they were a conspiracy made up of Spenceans who in fact wanted to bring in universal suffrage, but that's not what they were executed for. They were executed for planning to kill the entire cabinet.)\n\n* I don't know what this poster is counting as \"the last armed rebellion against the state in this country\" is, but it apparently doesn't count the Easter Rising (1916), or the Provisional IRA's campaigns in the troubles (1969-1997), considering that by the early 1850s Chartism was in its death throes.\n\nI'm not going to deal with:\n\n&gt; the british died fighting fascism in europe so your elections would be free.\n\non the grounds that it'd necessarily infringe on the April Moratorium.

If we class Charlotte as black, then ergo Queen Victoria and our entire royal family, [down] to Prince Harry, are also black ... a very interesting concept.\"\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/race-monarchy\n\nFirst, this sounds like a parody of the [one drop rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule), an *American* construct that says that having *any* black ancestry makes one fully black. It does not necessarily apply anywhere else. Plus, in most cases it was about 1/8 or 1/16 black ancestry, not one ancestor in the *Middle Ages.* The concept of \"race\" didn't even *exist* way back then, which is why you hear the term \"Moor\" used ambiguously to refer to Arabs, Berbers, Black Africans, and even Sri Lankan Muslims. The first people to identify as white were [Spanish and Portuguese colonists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_race_concepts#Early_Modern_period), who likely had more \"Moorish\" (which can have [any combination of \"white\" and \"black\" features](http://www.realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/Misc/North_Africa/Amazigh.jpg)) ancestry than QEII. \n\n#2: Emperor Akihito is Korean.\n\nThis actually comes from the Emperor's mouth:\n\n&gt;'I, on my part, feel a certain kinship with Korea,'' and went on to cite an ancient chronicle that says the grandmother of his eighth-century imperial ancestor, Kammu, was from a Korean kingdom. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/11/world/japan-rediscovers-its-korean-past.html\n\nOnce again, here you have someone citing ancestry from before the 1400s as an ethnic identity...but here, the Emperor manages to outdo the Grauniad by citing an ancestor from *the 700s.* However, [most Japanese have at least some Korean ancestry](http://www.koreabang.com/2012/stories/dna-analysis-confirms-japanese-are-of-korean-descent.html) if you go [far enough back](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_Japan#History), so using one ancestor from over 1,000 years ago to declare your ethnicity is trivial and therefore means that Hideki Tojo, a Korean, was committing war crimes against his fellow Koreans during WWII and not against a different ethnic group.",

They did manage to settle in some southern areas of France way later, and even had a pirate base called Fraxinetum up until 1000, but after that it seems like the Moors began to gradually recede in France.\n\nSo basically, the Moors didn't conquer all of France, but they did have strongholds around the south.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/32buu0/chanel_invented_1920s_fashion/",
        "text": "(My first post here. Nervous! Please let me know if I've done it wrong.)\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I was reading Juliet Nicholson's *The Great Silence* (Grove Press, 2009). It was enjoyable, although sad, because it was about the end of WWI and the changes it had made to society. And then I got past the discussion of mourning etc. and it turned into the positive effects, which of course led into ... Chanel. And I honestly never finished the book.\n\nThe thing about Coco Chanel, possibly one of the most famous fashion designers of history today, is that she was a great teller of myths. Some of this was personal to her - her parentage and upbringing were obscure and depressing, and she wanted to conceal them - and some of it was the bluster and self-aggrandizing that you get with a lot of people hailed as geniuses, especially in the fashion world. But because of a combination of Chanel's own stories and humanity's love of simplified narratives about individuals changing the course of history, she's the queen of bad fashion history. (Well, maybe she ties with Catherine de' Medici and the idea that she forced the women of the French court to wear iron corsets with 13\" waists.) And it generally goes uncorrected - this is just a more detailed version of the narrative you hear about Chanel everywhere. BUT NOT ANYMORE.\n\nHere's the offending passage (the pages can be read in full on [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=7ps0c0cH6lEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20great%20silence&amp;pg=PT159#v=onepage&amp;q=vogue&amp;f=false):\n\n&gt;In November 1919 pictures of Gabrielle Chanel's chemise dress had filled the pages of Vogue: 'A gown that swathes the figure in straight soft folds, falling at the sides in little cascades.'  The editorial commended Chanel's reliance on an uncluttered natural beauty, with a dress that showed only a slender pair of shoulder straps holding it up.  The subsequent single-page spread devoted to Madame Lucile's chiffons and to Poiret's plumes seemed to be included simply out of respect for the old masters and appeared fearfully outdated. ... Once the matchless pace setter of individuality in fashion, Poiret snorted that her clothes resembled 'Cages lacking birds. Hives lacking bees.'\n\n&gt;One other French designer, Madeleine Vionnet, managed to survive the transition through the war years and become part of the revolution in fashion. Vionnet cleverly amalgamated a still lingering desire for femininity with the wish to dress without the restricting comfort of corsetry. ... But it was the androgyny promoted by Chanel that dominated women's fashion in Europe in 1919. ...\n\n&gt;During the war she discovered the versatility of jersey cloth as used by stable lads for shirts for training sessions, and began to make sweaters and waistless dresses for women from the same supple fabric.  The ornate Edwardian costume that according to a scornful Chanel had 'stifled the body's architecture' started to disappear.  Chanel was after 'moral honesty' in the way women presented themselves.  She had gauged the time for voicing these feelings to perfection.  ...\n\n&gt;The flamboyant colors of Paul Poiret's pre-war designs and the theatricality of Bakst's influential costumes for the Ballets Russes suddenly seemed tawdry and overdone. ... A look of luxury was achievable through the severity of simplicity.  Expensive poverty was the aim.  She dared to suggest that clothes themselves had ceased to matter and that it was the individual who counted.\n\n&gt;She cut her hair short 'because it annoyed me'.  Everyone cut off their hair in imitation. ... The British aristocracy came to Paris to be close to the source of inspiration. ... As hem lengths rose and flowerpot hats moulded themselves to the side of the head, a voluntary simplification of clothing spread across a wide spectrum of society.\n\nWhen I originally went at this on my blog, I did it point-by-point. And that works in a certain sense, but why I'm ultimately unsatisfied is that that way doesn't clarify the bigger pictures of a) the fashion world of the time or b) how The Chanel Myth distorts it and why it does.\n\nThe couture house tradition that we know today - celebrity designers, runway models, collections - was born in the 1870s; the original couture houses that were still in business by 1900 were only still in business because there was a transfer of power to a new generation. Mainly, this new generation consisted of the sons of the older one. Where today it's normal for the name to go on while head designers change, it was more common then for it to be inherited by a family member or sold to someone else who would work under their own name. (The exception is Redfern: John Redfern was succeeded by his protégé Charles Poynter, who took the name Charles Poynter Redfern in order to make it all legitimate.) Apart from these - Worth, Doucet, Redfern - the major houses that were active at the same time as Gabrielle Chanel, who opened her original dressmaking establishments in 1913, were being run by the same people that started them. They were opening gradually from the mid-1890s through the early 1910s: there was always new blood coming in, and she was competing in large part with relative newcomers rather than a solid establishment where she was a pioneer.\n\nLucile (Lucy, Lady Duff Gordon) and Paul Poiret, the two called \"old masters\" in *The Great Silence*, are fairly well-known today, and are popularly seen as the polar opposites representative of women's dress in the 1910s: she is stereotyped as chiffon and lace and pastels, he as bright colors and simple cuts. They in no way stood head and shoulders above Chéruit, Paquin, Beer, Jenny, or Lanvin, though, all of whom also appear in the pages of the exclusive and expensive *Gazette du Bon Ton*, along with the actual \"old masters\", Worth, Doucet, and Redfern. They were very successful, but their being remembered is not a good indication that they were the pre-eminent couturiers of the period. I'm not sure what the term is for this bias (familiarity or mere exposure effect? survivorship bias?), but it's pernicious.\n\n(Poiret's quote about \"hives lacking bees\" is often used as indicative of a big change in the fashionable body around this time, but the funny thing is that Poiret had always been designing for a thin, small-breasted figure. The difference between his ideal figure and that of the 1920s is tiny.)\n\nIt's impossible to point a finger at any couturier as a tide-changer. Fashion at this time was highly documented and moved incrementally - examinations of the *Gazette du Bon Ton* and the slightly more egalitarian *Harper's Bazaar* and *Vogue* show that all designers were updating their silhouettes and styles on a regular basis, as the changes flowed logically from one year's fashions into the next. Throughout the 1910s, simplicity was a high priority in design - it wasn't an invention in 1919. It's variously attributed to Mariano Fortuny, inventor of the [Delphos](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leconseillerdesdames.jpg) [dress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphos_gown) in 1907; Lucile, creator of the first evening dress intended to be worn without a corset, also in 1907; and Poiret, because he said that he designed the first dresses intended to be worn without a corset as well. Which just goes to show how prevailing ideas in fashion and the arts tend to come from more complex social forces than one person having a specific good idea.\n\nThroughout the 1910s, you can see the beginning of 1920s fashion. In the high-waisted, narrow-skirted part of the decade (roughly 1911-1914), there is no narrow waist to speak of, and a [columnar silhouette](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Uneroseparmilesroses.jpg) that [seriously resembles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Robe_de_d%C3%AEner_par_Redfern_1922_cropped.jpg) that of the 1920s. During the war years, the waistline dropped while remaining loose and skirts flared and shortened, leading the way for the narrow silhouette to come back with a shorter skirt and looser, lower waistline. [Simple, clean, loose evening gowns with light straps](http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?strucID=703624&amp;imageID=818456) were already a part of fashion by 1919, and another iteration of them should not be seen as something groundbreaking. Even a dress that slipped over the head without fastenings was in existence [by 1916](http://books.google.com/books?id=Qq00AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=slip-over%20dress&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q=slip-over%20dress&amp;f=false).\n\n(Something else in existence by 1916 was the bob. Popularized by the dancer [Irene Castle](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47da-5cdd-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) after her hair was cut in the hospital, it was first known as the \"Castle bob\". Chanel actually told multiple stories about her invention of the bob after the fact, and after Irene Castle had been forgotten by history.)\n\nParis was a difficult place to sell dresses to rich women during World War I, but all of the couture houses got back into the swing afterward - not just Chanel and Vionnet. The earliest to drop was technically Lucile, but this is because Lady Duff-Gordon left the company in 1922 for legal reasons, and it didn't survive without her. After the stock market crash - *that's* when the great firms started to close their doors. Poiret shut down in 1929; Beer merged with Drécoll in 1929-1930, and Doucet merged with Doeuillet at the same time; Agnes merged with Drécoll in 1931; Premet closed in 1931; Redfern closed in 1932; Drécoll-Doeuillet closed in the early 1930s; Chéruit closed in 1935; Boué Soeurs closed in 1937; Jenny closed in 1938. The advent of WWII didn't help either: the Paris couture houses closed down, and Vionnet and Callot Soeurs both failed to reopen afterward.\n\nChanel's success and increased visibility after WWI can be partially attributed to her having been based in the resort towns of Biarritz and Deauville. Biarritz is just across the border from neutral Spain, far from the fighting, and Deauville hosted soldiers in hospitals while the casinos remained open. She had an advantage that couturiers based in Paris and with much smaller operations in the resort towns lacked during that specific period - a huge advantage that gets downplayed in favor of the idea that Chanel was just \"better\" than everyone else. At the same time, it's important to realize how limited her success was at that time. Far from suddenly becoming the biggest name in postwar fashion, she was just one of the crowd.\n\nI contacted a friend/colleague who is still at the Fashion Institute of Technology and has access to their archives, and she examined both the November 1 and November 15, 1919 issues of *Vogue* for me. The truth? On the 1st, there's a short description of her collection with three sketches (very normal for *Vogue*), and a mention of the Princesse de Broglie wearing Chanel. On the 15th, there's another mention of the princess and one dress illustrated among those of other designers. Lucile is not mentioned at all. Poiret gets one dress illustration and one mention. *Her domination of Vogue in November 1919 never happened.* I have no idea where it came from, as the book is not well cited. But it's completely invented.\n\nIn fact, Chanel does not turn up frequently in fashion magazines in the early 1920s. The couture houses of the 1910s do instead - there's no sudden break where they all drop out. There are many issues of *Vogue* where she doesn't turn up at all, and there are plenty of other couturiers described as innovative and on-trend. Primary sources don't bear out the notion of Chanel as an overwhelmingly successful agent of change to anywhere near the same degree as her personal stories post-WWI, when her 1910s-1920s contemporaries had shut down or died and were largely forgotten. The narrative works because it turns the complexity of history into a straightforward hero narrative where one visionary individual changes the tide because they're simply superior to everyone else, and people like to read that. It's *shameless*, but it's understandable why it's bought.\n\n(Not even getting into her WWII shenanigans, this post has been long enough in the making.)",

And yes, I realize it's almost impossible, if not totally impossible, to get something like this completely accurate. So I'm being somewhat pedantic here, I guess. Oh well, this is /r/badhistory after all.\n\n---\n\nI'll use Korea as an example, a field I have more confidence in than most others (still not a professional, though), since doing a comprehensive R5 on all of this map requires a comprehensive knowledge of all of history. \n \n# BC 109\n\nMost of Korea is uncivilized and gray, filled with stateless barbarians. Despite the fact that [Wiman Joseon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiman_Joseon) had existed for decades by this point, and Wiman Joseon was a Chinese-influenced state with a complex bureaucracy (Chinese records mention various generals and ministers in King Ugeo's court) and with great regional clout, certainly worthy of a place on the map. \n\n# BC 74\n\nChina still has access to the Sea of Japan and controls [Hwanghae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwanghae), although out of the [four Chinese commanderies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Commanderies_of_Han)^1, more than half of Lintun (red on [this map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Hangunhyeon.PNG)) and more than half of Zhenfan (purple on the map linked just before) were apparently abandoned in BC 75 (after the two commanderies were merged with the more eastern and northern commanderies in BC 81) because both were not maintainable.\n\n# BC 57\n\n\n[Silla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla) appears fully formed, already controlling all of southwest Korea. But Silla (by this point was a statelet/chiefdom based principally in [Seorabeol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongju) and its environs, and there was little yet to distinguish them from [other statelets/chiefdoms in the region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinhan_confederacy). \n\nAlso, its capital is called Gyeongju, despite the toponym having been coined in *940 AD.* Before, the town/city was called Seorabeol (probably the ancestor of Modern Korean \"Seoul\"), Geumseong, etc. For most other toponyms, the map tries to avoid anachronisms, so I'm not sure why it does this for Gyeongju.\n\nAnother anachronism; the first known use of the term \"Silla\" or a derivative thereof dates from the fifth century AD.\n\n# BC 37\n\n[Goguryeo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo) is in *central Korea.*\n\nIt has been an established fact literally for millennia that Goguryeo began in the central [Yalu river](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalu_River) region and that Jilin was the center of Goguryeo until the fifth century AD when the capital moved to Pyongyang. This is supported by every surviving record. This is supported by the presence of [major](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwanggaeto_Stele) [Goguryeo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_General) [sites and artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gungnae_Fortress) in Jilin. This is supported by the fact that Goguryeo's capital was sacked by northern Chinese dynasties several times before moving to Pyongyang, which would have been very difficult if Goguryeo was centered in Central Korea. In other words, Goguryeo's original center being far north of central Korea is supported by every single piece of evidence we have.\n\n[This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/History_of_Korea-001.png) is a much more realistic map of the region around 1 AD.\n\n# BC 18\n\n[Baekje](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje) has all of southeastern Korea from the very beginning despite:\n\n* not being anything much more than one chiefdom or statelet [out of 54 chiefdoms or statelets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahan_confederacy)\n\n* the southernmost reaches of Mahan not being under Baekje power even by the fourth century AD; for example, we have records of Mahan statelets sending envoys to the [Jin Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(265%E2%80%93420) ) under their own initiative. As with Silla, the southern expansion of Baekje at the behest of Mahan was a gradual process, in no way did Baekje emerge out of the blue with that much territory\n\nAnd Baekje already has Jeju Island, the small island just south of Korea with Kyushu to its east. However, the local kingdom of [Tamna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamna) ruled the island for more than a thousand years after 18 BC.\n\n# AD 43\n\nSome of Silla and Baekje territories transform into [Gaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaya_confederacy). The reader immediately thinks that Gaya was some sort of rebellion. However, what actually happened was that Gaya was simply an evolution of the old [Byeonhan confederacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byeonhan_confederacy). It is unlikely that Silla and Baekje would have had much direct political power in the Byeonhan region at the time, and Gaya was the development of a local political entity, not a rebellion as the map seems to show.\n\n# AD 92\n\nThe map shows China abandoning its Lelang commandery centered in Pyongyang, although Lelang continued to exist long after the fall of the Han Dynasty (apparently as a *de facto* independent entity). In fact, I can't find anything happening with China's surviving Korean commanderies around 92 AD.\n\n# 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centures AD\n\nAlthough in reality all three Korean kingdoms were expanding, solidifying, and warring in this period, the map shows them doing nothing at all. Also, while Goguryeo was actually a significant power in southern NE China, in the map it has only a sliver of land north of the Yalu.\n\n[This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/History_of_Korea-375.png) is a better map of Korea, 375 AD. Compare to [this](http://i.imgur.com/p61iWVA.png), especially WRT Goguryeo territories north of the peninsula.\n\n# 440 AD\n\nGoguryeo suddenly expands to over three times its size. Three problems with this.\n\nFirst, Goguryeo already had significant territories in southern Manchuria. Second, Goguryeo did not have that much land west of the Liao River; its hold on Liaoxi was generally rare and tenuous.\n\nThird, I actually have a translated copy of the [*Samguk Sagi*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samguk_sagi) with me right now. I open it, look for what happened in Goguryeo in 440 AD. Apparently, nothing noteworthy happened that year. I look for what happened around 440 AD. In AD 439 they sent tribute to a Chinese dynasty. In 450 AD, Silla people killed a general on the frontier, and the king of Goguryeo was about to invade until the king of Silla begged for forgiveness. Nothing at all about Goguryeo expanding enormously.\n\n# 7th century AD\n\nBy this point, [the Liao River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_River) was effectively the western border of Goguryeo. The map portrays significant territory west of the Liao in the hands of Goguryeo. This is ridiculous - in 598, Goguryeo, with 10,000 [Mohe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohe_people) soldiers, attacked *west* of the Liao (遼西, Liaoxi) in order to provoke the Sui Dynasty. Goguryeo was not attacking *its own territories*.\n\n# 650s AD\n\nIn this decade, Baekje was seriously undermining Silla power through invasion and was conquering a lot of Silla territory. This is not reflected in the map, which does a very poor job of reflecting more fluid borders.\n\n# 698 AD - 926 AD\n\n[Balhae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balhae) pops up, a fully formed empire already, in 698 AD. ***Its borders do not change a single bit for the twenty-seven decades of its existence.*** This is not what actually happened.\n\n# 1107\n\nAround this time, the Korean dynasty of Goryeo [briefly took Jurchen land after a campaign to the northeast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yun_Gwan#Victory_over_the_Jurchen). This is not reflected in the map.\n\n# 1241\n\nIn the map, the Mongols conquer all of Korea this year. This is just dumb. [Not only were there no Mongol invasions anywhere in Korea in 1241](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Korea), Korea continued to be ruled by [the anti-Mongol Choe regime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo_military_regime) from Ganghwa Island until 1258, and [Korea was still not completely under Mongol domination until 1273](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambyeolcho_Rebellion). Also, even under Mongol rule, the old Goryeo Dynasty continued to rule most of the peninsula as vassal kings to the Yuan Emperor in [Khanbaliq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanbaliq) (though their power was very limited by Yuan interference), so it would probably be erroneous to show no distinction between Goryeo's status as a vassal to the Mongols and, say, northern China's status as ruled directly by the Mongols, as this map does.\n\n# Joseon Dynasty\n\nKorea has land north of the Yalu. [Despite the fact that Korean maps from the time actually note how the Yalu River is the northern boundary of Korea.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Daedongyeojido-full.jpg) (on the map linked, you can see a river, represented by a blue line, to the northeastern border; this river is the Yalu)\n\n# 1789\n\nIn 1789, the map shows three Korean cities; the capital of Hanseong and two other cities, Daegu and Busan. We would think that these three were the largest cities in Korea during this time.\n\nHowever, we actually happen to have firm numbers on the population of Korean cities and towns in 1789, since government censuses have survived. A list of Korean cities/towns with a population in the tens of thousands:\n\n* [Hanseong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul), the capital (modern Seoul), was by far the largest city, with a population of 189,153 people\n* [Kaesong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong) was the second largest city, with a population of 27,769 people\n* [Pyongyang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang) was the third largest, with a population of 21,869\n* [Sangju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangju), now a minor city, was the fourth largest town in Korea; in 1789 its population was 18,296\n* [Jeonju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeonju) was the fifth largest, with a population of 16,694\n* Daegu was only the ***sixth*** largest town, with a population of merely 13,734\n* [Chungju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungju) had a population of 11,950 people, making it the seventh largest town\n* [Uiju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uiju_County), on the border with China, had a population of 10,838 and was the eighth largest town\n\n(Busan had a population between 5,000 and 10,000)\n\nSo what's the criteria for being shown on the map? And why aren't Kaesong and Pyongyang, much larger and more important cities (culturally, economically, etc) than Daegu and Busan, shown on the map?\n\n---\n\n^1: As the Wikipedia article briefly mentions, other than Lelang which we know from a plethora of archaeological evidence to have been in the Pyongyang region, we do not actually know the precise locations of the other three. Zhenfan, for instance, may have been in Hwanghae, but it might also have been in Liaodung. Lintun, for another example, has been said to be in the Seoul region or even near the Russian Far East. However, the interactive map clearly considers the Commanderies to have been positioned like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Hangunhyeon.PNG) so my point still stands.\n\n---\n\n# Other oddities\n\n* The map takes European claims to territories as equivalent to Europeans actually taking control over the territory. For instance, it shows the British as somehow magically conquering the eastern half of Australia from 1789 to 1790, including the Simpson Desert, [which no European even saw before the 1840s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_Desert#History) And in 1751, Portugal takes control over *all* of the Amazon somehow, including regions Brazil still has tenuous influence over (Yanomami land, for example), and Spain also takes all of the Cone, including land held by the Mapuche who were not conquered until the end of the 19th century. The reason for both is because of [the Treaty of Madrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Madrid_(13_January_1750)\n\n* If you set the map 1760, the Iroquois are located in the Ohio Valley instead of where they actually live\n\n* In 1644, Qing takes all of China. [Southern Ming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ming) don't real.\n\n* The Inca government-in-exile in Vilcabamba don't real.\n\n* The Pueblo Revolt don't real.\n\n* After the collapse of Mayapan, the Maya region just turns gray. So 16th century Maya kingdoms don't real. Not surprisingly, Nojpeten don't real\n\n* Particularly with ancient periods, the criteria seem bizarre, for instance the Minoans are included as a civilization in BC 3000 while Norte Chico or the Indus Valley Civilization is not\n\n* There were apparently no Andean civilizations worth mentioning before Wari and Tiwanaku\n\n* Go to 701 AD, you will notice that China is named \"Wu Zetian.\" Well, [Wu Zetian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian) was a woman who ruled the [Zhou Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian#Second_Zhou_dynasty). Calling the Zhou Dynasty \"Wu Zetian\" is like calling the USA \"Barack Obama\".\n\n* Several [Fulani jihad states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_jihads) don't real\n\n* It appears that all of the British Isles, including Ireland, are part of the United Kingdom after 1707, since the [Kingdom of Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland) is never mentioned nor shown\n\n* Great Zimbabwe doesn't seem to exist\n\n* The [Iberian Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Union), despite the fact that \"the governments, institutions, and legal traditions of each kingdom remained independent of each other,\" means that Portugal was annexed by Spain. Or at least that's what the map implies, since when the Iberian Union is in effect every \"Portugal\" on the map turns into \"Spain\"\n\n* The Maori show up around 900 AD when in reality they almost certainly [arrived in the thirteenth century](http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/2690/Lowe%202008%20Polynesian%20settlement%20guidebook.pdf;jsessionid=26D9071D2BC799304D807B68715D8665?sequence=1)\n\n* Bizarrely enough, \"Papuans\" appear in 1600 BC, and before that the map implies New Guinea was empty of people. However, New Guinea was inhabited and had already independently developed agriculture [long before 1600 BC.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea#Human_presence)\n\n* The borders of the Shang Dynasty and the Zhou Dynasty remain exactly the same for their entire existence\n\n* In 3000 BC, European archaeological phases are referred to with their actual names, everything in the Americas are \"hunter-gatherers\" or \"agrarian societies\"\n",

It is unlikely that Silla and Baekje would have had much direct political power in the Byeonhan region at the time, and Gaya was the development of a local political entity, not a rebellion as the map seems to show.\n\n# AD 92\n\nThe map shows China abandoning its Lelang commandery centered in Pyongyang, although Lelang continued to exist long after the fall of the Han Dynasty (apparently as a *de facto* independent entity). In fact, I can't find anything happening with China's surviving Korean commanderies around 92 AD.\n\n# 2nd and 3rd centures AD\n\nAlthough in reality all three Korean kingdoms were expanding, solidifying, and warring in this period, the map shows them doing nothing at all. Also, while Goguryeo was actually a significant power in southern NE China, in the map it has only a sliver of land north of the Yalu.\n\n[This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/History_of_Korea-375.png) is a better map of Korea, 375 AD. Compare to [this](http://i.imgur.com/p61iWVA.png), especially WRT Goguryeo territories north of the peninsula.\n\n# 440 AD\n\nGoguryeo suddenly expands to over three times its size. Three problems with this.\n\nFirst, Goguryeo already had significant territories in southern Manchuria. Second, Goguryeo did not have that much land west of the Liao River; its hold on Liaoxi was generally rare and tenuous.\n\nThird, I actually have a translated copy of the [*Samguk Sagi*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samguk_sagi) with me right now. I open it, look for what happened in Goguryeo in 440 AD. Apparently, nothing noteworthy happened that year. I look for what happened around 440 AD. In AD 439 they sent tribute to a Chinese dynasty. In 450 AD, Silla people killed a general on the frontier, and the king of Goguryeo was about to invade until the king of Silla begged for forgiveness. Nothing at all about Goguryeo expanding enormously.\n\n# 7th century AD\n\nBy this point, [the Liao River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_River) was effectively the western border of Goguryeo. The map portrays significant territory west of the Liao in the hands of Goguryeo. This is ridiculous - in 598, Goguryeo, with 10,000 [Mohe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohe_people) soldiers, attacked *west* of the Liao (遼西, Liaoxi) in order to provoke the Sui Dynasty. Goguryeo was not attacking *its own territories*.\n\n# 650s AD\n\nIn this decade, Baekje was seriously undermining Silla power through invasion. This is not reflected in the map. Ancient borders were more fluid than modern borders, and this map does a very poor job of reflecting this. The Silla - Baekje border, the border between two enemies, did not remain unchanging for centuries.\n\n# 698 AD - 926 AD\n\n[Balhae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balhae) pops up, a fully formed empire already, in 698 AD. ***Its borders do not change a single bit for the twenty-seven decades of its existence.*** This is not what actually happened.\n\n# 1107\n\nAround this time, the Korean dynasty of Goryeo [briefly took Jurchen land after a campaign to the northeast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yun_Gwan#Victory_over_the_Jurchen). This is not reflected in the map.\n\n# 1241\n\nIn the map, the Mongols conquer all of Korea this year. This is just dumb. [Not only were there no Mongol invasions anywhere in Korea in 1241](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Korea), Korea continued to be ruled by [the anti-Mongol Choe regime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo_military_regime) from Ganghwa Island until 1258, and [Korea was still not completely under Mongol domination until 1273](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambyeolcho_Rebellion). Also, even under Mongol rule, the old Goryeo Dynasty continued to rule most of the peninsula as vassal kings to the Yuan Emperor in [Khanbaliq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanbaliq) (though their power was very limited by Yuan interference), so it would probably be erroneous to show no distinction between Goryeo's status as a vassal to the Mongols and, say, northern China's status as ruled directly by the Mongols, as this map does.\n\n# Joseon Dynasty\n\nKorea has land north of the Yalu. [Despite the fact that Korean maps from the time actually note how the Yalu River is the northern boundary of Korea.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Daedongyeojido-full.jpg) (on the map linked, you can see a river, represented by a blue line, to the northeastern border; this river is the Yalu)\n\n# 1789\n\nIn 1789, the map shows three Korean cities; the capital of Hanseong and two other cities, Daegu and Busan. We would think that these three were the largest cities in Korea during this time.\n\nHowever, we actually happen to have firm numbers on the population of Korean cities and towns in 1789, since government censuses have survived. A list of Korean cities/towns with a population in the tens of thousands:\n\n* [Hanseong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul), the capital (modern Seoul), was by far the largest city, with a population of 189,153 people\n* [Kaesong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong) was the second largest city, with a population of 27,769 people\n* [Pyongyang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang) was the third largest, with a population of 21,869\n* [Sangju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangju), now a minor city, was the fourth largest town in Korea; in 1789 its population was 18,296\n* [Jeonju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeonju) was the fifth largest, with a population of 16,694\n* Daegu was only the ***sixth*** largest town, with a population of merely 13,734\n* [Chungju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungju) had a population of 11,950 people, making it the seventh largest town\n* [Uiju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uiju_County), on the border with China, had a population of 10,838 and was the eighth largest town\n\n(Busan had a population between 5,000 and 10,000)\n\nSo what's the criteria for being shown on the map? And why aren't Kaesong and Pyongyang, much larger and more important cities (culturally, economically, etc) than Daegu and Busan, shown on the map?\n\n---\n\n^1: As the Wikipedia article briefly mentions, other than Lelang which we know from a plethora of archaeological evidence to have been in the Pyongyang region, we do not actually know the precise locations of the other three. Zhenfan, for instance, may have been in Hwanghae, but it might also have been in Liaodung. Lintun, for another example, has been said to be in the Seoul region or even near the Russian Far East. However, the interactive map clearly considers the Commanderies to have been positioned like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Hangunhyeon.PNG) so my point still stands.\n\n---\n\n# Other oddities\n\n* The map takes European claims to territories as equivalent to Europeans actually taking control over the territory. For instance, it shows the British as somehow magically conquering the eastern half of Australia from 1789 to 1790, including the Simpson Desert, [which no European even saw before the 1840s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_Desert#History) And in 1751, Portugal takes control over *all* of the Amazon somehow, including regions Brazil still has tenuous influence over (Yanomami land, for example), and Spain also takes all of the Cone, including land held by the Mapuche who were not conquered until the end of the 19th century. The reason for both is because of [the Treaty of Madrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Madrid_(13_January_1750)\n\n* If you set the map 1760, the Iroquois are located in the Ohio Valley instead of where they actually live\n\n* In 1644, Qing takes all of China. [Southern Ming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ming) don't real.\n\n* The Inca government-in-exile in Vilcabamba don't real.\n\n* The Pueblo Revolt don't real.\n\n* After the collapse of Mayapan, the Maya region just turns gray. So 16th century Maya kingdoms don't real. Not surprisingly, Nojpeten don't real\n\n* Particularly with ancient periods, the criteria seem bizarre, for instance the Minoans are included as a civilization in BC 3000 while Norte Chico or the Indus Valley Civilization is not\n\n* There were apparently no Andean civilizations worth mentioning before Wari and Tiwanaku\n\n* Go to 701 AD, you will notice that China is named \"Wu Zetian.\" Well, [Wu Zetian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian) was a woman who ruled the [Zhou Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian#Second_Zhou_dynasty). Calling the Zhou Dynasty \"Wu Zetian\" is like calling the USA \"Barack Obama\".\n\n* Several [Fulani jihad states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_jihads) don't real\n\n* It appears that all of the British Isles, including Ireland, are part of the United Kingdom after 1707, since the [Kingdom of Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland) is never mentioned nor shown\n\n* Great Zimbabwe doesn't seem to exist\n\n* The [Iberian Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Union), despite the fact that \"the governments, institutions, and legal traditions of each kingdom remained independent of each other,\" means that Portugal was annexed by Spain. Or at least that's what the map implies, since when the Iberian Union is in effect every \"Portugal\" on the map turns into \"Spain\"\n\n* The Maori show up around 900 AD when in reality they almost certainly [arrived in the thirteenth century](http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/2690/Lowe%202008%20Polynesian%20settlement%20guidebook.pdf;jsessionid=26D9071D2BC799304D807B68715D8665?sequence=1)\n\n* Bizarrely enough, \"Papuans\" appear in 1600 BC, and before that the map implies New Guinea was empty of people. However, New Guinea was inhabited and had already independently developed agriculture [long before 1600 BC.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea#Human_presence)\n\n* The borders of the Shang Dynasty and the Zhou Dynasty remain exactly the same for their entire existence\n\n* In 3000 BC, European archaeological phases are referred to with their actual names, everything in the Americas are \"hunter-gatherers\" or \"agrarian societies\"\n",

He first said\n&gt; The genocide was fake; this whole video is fake as fuck\n\nAs I argue with the denier, he says that the only sources of the genocide come from the Armenians themselves (ignoring Taner Akcam, Henry Morgenthau, and Falih Rifki Atay), and he then goes on blaming the Armenians for their own deaths by claiming they shouldn't have rebelled in the first place and then says this about one of their killers, Cemal of the Three Pashas\n&gt; Cemal Pasa was called the pasa of Armenia because his efforts to help the Armenians. He aswell was strongly opposed to the deportations.\n\nInteresting spin on one of the architects of the genocide, and sounds just as likely as Himmler saving the Jews.\n\nI then press him on about the other minorities who perished at the same time, and finally he says sarcastically\n&gt;I guess the Turks did the burning of Smyrna aswell ?\n\nWhich is actually established by multiple foreign witnesses, including the consulate generals of the US, the UK, and France.\n\nHe then goes on about how Turkey fed the Armenians during the deportations, that the genocide is a Marxist Conspiracy, and then gives his website as his only defense. http://turkish-ichistory.com/2015/01/conditions-of-deported-armenians/\n\nRule 5: This genocide denier tries to convince that Turkey actually treated their victims well, never intended to starve or kill them, that one of the main perpetrators was actually their protector, and uses his own biased website as his only defense against a plethora of established material from first hand accounts and professors that prove his theory wrong.\n\nedit: Format errors",

        "text": "As some people may know, I'm a big fan of the Dragon Age series of games.  I consider it an intelligent, mature take on fantasy and it's fun as hell.  Recently, however, I came across [this post](http://holyshitdragonage.tumblr.com/post/116158614431/non-magic-medicine-in-thedas).  \n\nA bit of background for those not familiar: In the series, the Chantry is the major religious authority in most nations.  It's essentially an [expy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy) for the Catholic Church in Medieval Europe, complete with a schism along geographic boundaries.  The Chantry bans blood magic, a \"dark magic\" that relies on human/elven/dwarven/etc. blood to power spells.  On the other hand, most healing is performed by Chantry-sanctioned mage healers.\n\nRule 5: Despite the posts' claims that \n\n&gt; People in Thedas did not [sic] to deal with the actions of the christian church\n\nthus \n\n&gt; witch hunts would likely not have destroyed centuries worth of herbal knowledge by killing those who used herbs to heal.\n\nthe Catholic Church did not set science, medical or otherwise, back by centuries during the Middle Ages.  First off, as has been discussed many times with regard to the infamous Chart (discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/22uea0/the_person_behind_the_chart_tries_to_negate_all/)), technological advancement is not something that advances along a linear path.  [This comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1aggse/the_native_americans_and_several_other_cultures/c8x977d) explains how technological development is not a forward/backward progress.\n\n&gt; People create technologies to respond to perceived social and environmental needs, and there's no \"forward\" or \"backward\" motion to it, unless a particular society decides that there is.\n\nSecond, the Catholic Church was not responsible for a massive decline in knowledge, often labeled the \"Dark Ages\".  This trope has been covered multiple times both in this subreddit and /r/AskHistorians\nI think /u/Mediaevumed explains [this idea] (http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10an7j/how_was_the_relationship_between_the_church_and/c6bu2h8) well.\n\n&gt; We see the 'birth' of the University, of medical and law schools during the 12th century renaissance (noting a naming trend?) and the use of credit in mercantile ventures.\nSo yeah, saying that 1000 years of Human Progress, where things like Parliament, the development of major urban centers and our modern educational system have their origins is a bit dismissive.\n\n  Long story short, no, Christianity did not set Europe back millennia during the Middle Ages.  \nFinally, the post specifically mentions witches as being targeted by the church during the Middle Ages.  To cite the [Wikipedia page on witch hunts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt), \n&gt; The classical period of witchhunts in Europe and North America falls into the Early Modern period or about 1400 to 1700, spanning the upheavals of the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, resulting in an estimated 35,000 to 100,000 executions, mostly women.\n\nWitch hunts were much more common in the Early Modern period, during and after the Catholic Church's power was weakened by the Protestant Reformation.\n\nTL;DR: The Catholic Church didn't set back medicine by centuries in Europe through witch hunts.  I'm petty about blog posts about fictional universes.  Mage Freedom 4 lyfe.",

I'm looking here at the line spoken by the Green Party representative at around 2:48-2:51:\n\n&gt; Like it? It's been number one for about 200 years.\n\nPresumably this is referring to the claim that all the major parties are largely indistinguishable in policy terms.  Unfortunately, this clearly isn't the case.  It's only recently, for instance, that the Labour Party has shifted so far to the center. \n\nBecause I'm lazy, and this already exists, [here is a visualisation](http://politicalcompass.org/images/enPartiesTime.gif) of the political shifts in UK parties since 1972. As we can see, Labour of 1972 (led by Harold Wilson) had a noticeably socially liberal and economically left-of-center stance, easily distinguishable from Ted Heath's right of center and less liberal conservative party.  The Liberal Party (not yet the Liberal Democrats) under Jeremy Thorpe (yes, I had to look that up) is distinguished from both with economically and socially liberal policies.   \n\nFurther back, the 1945 general election is a perfect example of the differences between the major parties at the time.  Labour ran on a platform of a cradle-to-grave welfare state, including a health service free at the point of service for all, and full employment.  The conservative platform, by contrast, claimed that Labour's welfare state was unaffordable.  All the major parties having been indistinguishable in 1945 -- hardly!\n\nLabour, for instance, was founded as a party of the trades unions, and its manifestos contained the term *socialism* up until 1992.  In its early years, it was sometimes an explicitly socialist party (especially with the (in)famous Clause IV, reading for many years that the party aimed to secure for the workers of Britain \"the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange\".\n\nBy contrast, the conservative party at the same time was anti-socialist, agressively patriotic, and aimed to secure its rural base of support -- as opposed to Labour's urban workers...\n\nIn fact, pretty much the only thing which has been consistent between the parties for the whole of the last two hundred years is that all of the parties with a chance of winning -- with the exception of Thatcher's conservative party -- have been run by white men.  White men as prime minister is a state of affairs that goes back for more than 200 years, however...\n\nThe major parties in the UK haven't even stayed consistent for the past 200 years.  In 1815, the major parties were the Tories and Whigs.  The Conservative party was founded in 1834, the Liberal Party, 1859, Labour, 1900, and the Liberal Democrats, 1988. UKIP weren't founded until 1993. 200 years ago, none of the parties featuring in the video even existed!  (The Green Party was founded in 1985, and separated into the Green Party of England and Wales, Green Party of Scotland, and Green Party of Northern Ireland in 1990)",

        "text": "There is just so much wrong with [this article](http://sabotagetimes.com/people/slavery-sexual-exploitation-why-the-romans-were-an-appalling-civilisation/) .\nWell where to begin but the start: \n&gt;We’ve all seen the Monty Python sketch, ‘what have the Romans done for us?’.\n\nThe legacy of the Roman Republic and Empire can still be felt today – from water transportation and industrialised production, to news reportage and the welfare state.\n\nHowever, it is a truism that history is written by the winners. Not many people are familiar with the cruelty and violence at the heart of Roman society.\n\nBut by exposing the severity of the atrocities committed in the name of Rome, we can reveal the dark side of the ancient world’s most infamous regime.\n\nWar of Plunder\n\nThe glory of Rome was founded on blood. The Republic’s – and, later, Empire’s – massive economy and rapid territorial expansion were both funded primarily by plunder.\n\nAt their peak, the Romans controlled territory on three continents, slaughtering any opposition and forcing Roman culture on the native inhabitants.\n\nGladiator_Maximus\n\nConsider the following statement from Historians, Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke:\n\n“The economy of the Empire was a Raubwirtschaft or plunder economy based on looting existing resources rather than producing anything new. The Empire relied on booty from conquered territories or on a pattern of tax collection that drove small-scale farmers into destitution.”\n\nWealthy Romans profited hugely from this war economy, while subjugated populations were worked to the bone to sustain the Empire’s military might.\n\nTyrannical Leadership\n\nUnsurprisingly for such a dominating and aggressive society, Rome produced some truly evil statesmen – particularly during its imperial phase.\n\nFor instance, Commodus (as portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in ‘Gladiator’) was Emperor of Rome for 12 years, between 180 and 192 AD.\n\nDespite being a complete coward, he adored gladiatorial combat and would have cripples and undesirables rounded up and lashed together into ungainly ‘giants’ for him to slay in the coliseum.\n\nCommodus was despised by the Senate for bringing Rome into disrepute with this posing, not to mention his enormous gambling debts – and, eventually, a group of conspirators paid Commodus’ favourite wrestler to strangle him in the bath.\n\nHowever, Commodus’ crimes were minor transgressions compared to the actions of Caligula ‘Little Boots’ Cesar, whose madness and sadism are strangely absent from most modern texts on Roman history.\n\nCaligula’s favourite torture/execution method involved fileting the condemned with a saw-blade from spine, to crotch, to chest. Excess blood in the brain prevented unconsciousness and death could take hours.\n\nAs a pastime between executions, Caligula also enjoyed chewing up the testicles of his victims – while still alive, of course.\n\nHis reign was mercifully cut short by the Praetorian Guard, who betrayed their Emperor, stabbed him to death and threw his body to the dogs – although he was allegedly so rotten that even they couldn’t stomach him.\n\n\nMore…\n\nFemininity &amp; Vaginal Virtue: 5 Of The Best Loved Roman Women\n\nGoat-Skin Thongs, Penis Pendants &amp; Dog Crucifixion: 10 Fucked-Up Facts About The Romans\n\nSlavery and Sexual Exploitation Throughout its 1000-year history\n\nAncient Rome’s vast slave trade was a cornerstone of its economy.\n\nMost slaves were war captives, sold as property to the Roman citizenry. A slave of Rome had absolutely no rights and was utterly at the mercy of his/her master (a situation known as ‘dominica potestas’), who could use them for sexual gratification and have them flogged or killed as they pleased.\n\nIn fact, Roman law and classical moral philosophies defined a slave as a ‘non-person’ with no autonomy or selfhood. Marcel Mauss states that, in the eyes of Romans, ‘servus non habet personam’ (‘a slave has no persona’)’\n\nConsequently, Roman slaveholders had no qualms about punishing captured runaways with crucifixion.\n\nWhile some laws were eventually imposed by the Empire to protect slaves, they were largely ignored and many slaves chose to commit suicide rather than endure their lot. Shockingly, at the height of Rome’s power, slaves represented 10-15% of the total population of the Empire.\n\nSystematic Rape\n\nIn antiquity, war rape was an integral aspect of virtually all military conflicts, with conquered civilians (both men and women) serving as spoils for the Roman soldiery.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus notes that even prepubescent boys were raped en masse by Roman officers during the Revolt of Batavi.\n\nEven The Bible alludes to war rape by the Roman Empire, with Zechariah 14:2 quoting a centurion who boasted, ‘I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women taken…’.\n\nAs with enslaved peoples, the Romans did not regard these rape victims as having any rights or persona – instead, mere commodities to be used, and then discarded, by ‘true’ citizens.\n\nCaligula-9235253-2-402\n\nGenocide and Ethnic Cleansing\n\nFrom the sack of Ancient Carthage after the Third Punic War, and the annihilation of Ilurgia, to the Gallic genocides, and the relentless persecution of ethnic Jews – the Romans responded to any hint of rebellion from perceived ‘inferiors’ with utter liquidation.\n\nAs Dr. Miland Brown points out, ‘War was different in the ancient world. There was no Geneva Convention back then. There were no rules for war other than those decided on by the combatants and which they then had the power to enforce.’\n\nBy the fall of the Empire, the Romans had slaughtered around 8 million people, a staggering number considering the inefficiency of ancient war technologies. Galgacus, a Caledonian chief, summarised Roman military strategy and imperial subjugation, when he said, ‘Where they make a desert, they call it peace.’\n\nIn summary, Ancient Rome is clearly guilty of every war crime and breach of human rights imaginable. Were its leadership around today, any tribunal would be an open and shut case.\n\nHowever, the crimes described above were conducted before the introduction of rules for conflict. In the ancient world, they weren’t true crimes at all.\n\nFor the most part, the atrocities committed by Rome were acts of intimidation, designed to maintain a stranglehold of fear over its subjects.\n\nIn its defence, the Romans were willing to accept conquered nations into the general citizenry, as long as they paid fealty to the Emperor and kept his peace. In these terms, despite being power-hungry and ruthless, the Romans were not completely without mercy.\n\nI’m willing to offer the Romans some credit for their contributions to science, culture and civilisation.\n\nBeyond that, I’m consigning this remarkable, appalling civilisation to the eternal Hall of Infamy.\n",

        "text": "EDIT: Don't brigade the thread I linked to. That means no voting in it and no commenting in it. Doing so is a quick and easy way to get yourself shadowbanned.\n\n[This thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/309zvh/days_of_wonder_removes_slave_cards_from_five/) popped up in /r/boardgames recently debating the changes in depicting slavery in the board game \"5 Tribes.\" If you're interested in the sensation of a power drill being rammed through your ear and your brains being scrambled, I recommend reading through the discussion. I bring it up, though, because the thread has loads of bad history, but today, I just want to talk about [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/309zvh/days_of_wonder_removes_slave_cards_from_five/cpqvhme) which is laughably wrong. \n\nTo start, there was absolutely slavery on the island of Puerto Rico. I don't know if the native peoples of Puerto Rico - the Tainos - practiced slavery (and would love it if someone would tell me), but certainly by the time the Spanish arrived, slavery became a thing. In fact, that's a bit of theme of Spanish and European colonisation of the New World - first Europeans show up, then there is slavery. Puerto Rico is no exception to this, especially considering the presence of profitable gold mines on the island.\n\nBut I'll start from the beginning. Christopher Columbus arrived in Puerto Rico in 1493, naming it San Juan Bautista. He is met - like in Cuba - by Tainos, some of whom he immediately enslaves and brings back to Spain as an example of the fun stuff he found in the Indies. I'll grant you, this may not be an example of slavery in Puerto Rico itself as those Tainos were taken elsewhere, but certainly it is an example of slavery happening. \n\nThe more relevant example - especially with regards to the board game that's being discussed in the comment I linked - is in 1509 when a *repartimiento* is established in San Juan Bautista. This sets a fixed number of Tainos as being available for use by each Spanish colonist as forced, unpaid labour. Many of these are used in the local gold mines, though some are also used on the burgeoning sugar and tobacco plantations. The Tainos, predictably, are rather unhappy about this, and protest by rising up or dying in large numbers. In 1511, the Tainos rebel against the Spanish, but lose rather badly, leading to 6000 of them being shot in retaliation, and many of the rest fleeing into the mountains to hide.\n\nHowever, there were those that protested against the treatment of the Tainos. Some Spanish priests - most notably Bartolome de las Casas - protested the treatment of the Tainos, arguing that Christians couldn't be enslaved, and that the goal of colonisation in the Americas ought to be the Christianisation of the native peoples. This argument worked, somewhat, and colonial laws were changed. Rather than being enslaved outright, the native Tainos would be required to convert to Christianity, and then provide labour to the Spanish colonists. However, on a practical level, nothing really changed. The Spanish colonists continued to abuse the Tainos, and de las Casas' recommendations were largely ignored. \n\nHowever, the Spanish did begin to encounter a rather substantial problem with their slavery technique. Amazingly, when you shoot and overwork and murder a large portion of the population, there isn't a terribly large population that can then be exploited for labour. The Tainos were so depleted by disease and conflict that there weren't enough of them to be an effective labour force. To make up for it, the Spanish crown allowed each colonist to import twelve African slaves. By 1513, African slaves were arriving in Puerto Rico en masse. By 1555, there were more than 15 000 of them. \n\nThese slaves were quickly put to work, building forts, mining gold, working on plantations, and doing all the things the Tainos were no longer able to do because they were dead. They were forcibly assimilated, being baptised into Christianity, taught Spanish, and given Spanish names. Interestingly, because they were more \"willing\" to be assimilated, they were seen as superior to the Tainos, but in actuality, many of these \"conversions\" and \"assimilations\" were false. Many continued to secretly practice their traditional beliefs and speak their native languages, despite prohibitions against it.\n\nThe fact that there were several major slave revolts throughout the 16th century is a demonstration of how badly many slaves actually \"assimilated.\" The first major slave revolt took place in 1527, not long after slaves had started arriving in Puerto Rico, though this one was rapidly crushed. Many more would be carried out, with the slaves killing their masters or fleeing to the Tainos to create maroon communities. These slave revolts were really kind of inevitable. Even beyond the fact that enslaved peoples don't tend to want to be enslaved, many of the slaves imported to the New World had been prisoners of war captured in West Africa. These were warriors and generals who would know how to lead a revolt, and indeed, did. Across the New World, these warriors led revolts, then defended the maroon communities to which they fled, in some places creating quite a nuisance of themselves. In Puerto Rico, the interaction between maroon communities and the colonists was more subdued, but rebellions and maroon communities did indeed exist. \n\nThere was assimilation in other ways in Puerto Rico as well. Many of the colonists and conquistadors were men, meaning there was a general shortage of free women. To make up for this, there was...shall we say intermingling between the free Spanish colonists and Taino and African women, creating mixed race children known as *mestizos* and *mulattos*. These children were the basis of the new racial make-up of the island, as well as the basis of increasingly bizarre racial laws. \n\nAnyway, by 1570, the gold mines were largely depleted, decreasing Puerto Rico's importance to the Spanish. Instead, it became a stop-over point for warships, as well as exporting sugar. The increase in sugar plantations on the island increased the demand for African slaves, leading to more and more being imported. In addition to these slaves, the Spanish crown also offered incentives for free Africans from Haiti and Jamaica to come to Puerto Rico to work by offering them land and money. This was surprisingly effective. \n\nIn 1789, *El Codigo Negro* was introduced, allowing slaves to be freed under certain circumstances. They could be freed if they purchased themselves from their master (or if they purchased their children), or in a variety of other circumstances, such as if they denounced their master as a traitor to the Spanish crown. This was a large step forward for the slaves of Puerto Rico, though it didn't lead to mass freedom, and certainly not to equality. By the 19th century, the number of slaves on the island had doubled to more than 260 000 slaves, leading free plantation owners to become paranoid about the free blacks. These free blacks were required to carry pass books establishing who they were and what they were up to. \n\nIn the 19th century, an abolitionist movement grew up on the island, and on 22 March, 1873, the Spanish government adopted the Moret Law for the island, which ostensibly ended slavery, though in actuality did not. It immediately freed all slaves over the age of 60, all children born after the passage of the law, and those that belonged to Spain itself. However, all other slaves had to continue working for three years and pay for their freedom at whatever price their masters set. The majority of slaves continued to work for their former master's, but some chose to go off and do other things, leaving their masters to be compensated by the state.\n\nIt's a touch inaccurate, then, to say there were no slaves in Puerto Rico. There were buckets of slaves in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's economy was built on slave labour, and the colony succeeded because of slaves. Beyond that, enslaved peoples left an indelible mark on Puerto Rican language, music, culture, and religion, as well as its ethnic make-up. There were slaves, they were busy, important slaves, and they should not be ignored when examining the history of Puerto Rico.",
