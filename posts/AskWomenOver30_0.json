        "text": "I have two questions:\n\n(1) Was it worth it? and\n(2) What small things did you do to make recovery easier (I live by myself)?\n\n(And yes I know there‚Äôs the lasik subreddit but I sense a lot of testimonials on there are from young folks or men).\n\nWhen I turned 40 I told myself I‚Äôd finally get on with getting vision correction. Better late than never and all that. So I spent about 7 months investigating options and going through appointments and settled on ICL (an implantable lens) since I‚Äôm not a candidate for lasik. I found a surgeon who answered all my questions and is pretty top in the field. I discussed things like how to deal with reading glasses and all of that when it comes along. I booked the surgery and it seemed great at the time.\n\nNow with surgery about a week away I‚Äôm starting to get cold feet. What if I get bad side effects? What if it makes my vision worse (sometimes they can overcorrect)? Like, if I can tolerate contacts now, why fix what ain‚Äôt broken? And while this one is a reversible surgery if something goes wrong, no surgeon here will remove the lenses for free. \n\nThe other thing I‚Äôm worried about is recovery. Doctors all say it‚Äôs fast but the lasik subreddit is full of people talking about recovery taking a while. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what things to do around the apartment to make it easier to recover (like, I guess swimming goggles if I need to take a shower)? Do I need to set up a screen reader? What other comfort things don‚Äôt surgeons tell you about?\n\nSo any tips from those who have gone through it would be great :)",

During the 12 yrs we were friends I was married to someone else. I ended up divorcing and my now ex and I were able to be together. \n\nIt was long distance and things got toxic really quickly between us. During that time he reconnected with his ex. He ended up breaking up with me last yr October. I ended up flying out to him. He didn't want to talk much about things and wanted to focus on enjoying our time together. Last day before leaving I see back to back calls between him and his ex during the time our relationship started getting sour (5 months). I don't confront him and simply ask him to not stay in touch with any of his exes. I come back, there are talks of marriage but we start falling back into the same toxic cycle of trust issues and him feeling like I am not prioritizing the relationship. He asks me to flyout to him in December which I can't because of work. He then invites me to come out and get married to him this March. I offer to come out in Summers so we could spend more time together. By now he starts checking out and starts stalling the wedding date. I start noticing the same pattern with him when he was connected to his Ex. Long story short he ends up breaking up with me 1st week of Jan stating there are a lot of redflags in the relationship and he can't trust me anymore. \n\nI don't beg or plead. I leave and go into NC. Looking back now he was using me to loose his feelings towards me to be fully committed to his ex who he would emotionally cheat on. \n\nI feel so low and disgusted with myself for bieng used by him like that and discarded. I feel like he won either way. Got to be with his unrequited love for a bit then is now in a fully committed relationship with his ex and starting a future with her. I am left here picking up pieces from all of that.\nAny insight/encouragement would be appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è",

        "text": "I recently went through a broken engagement with a long term partner and as a result, I‚Äôm (36M) just starting to date for the first time in my adult life (we were together from 18-35). I previously thought I 100% wanted children, but after going out for less than two months with literally the first woman I‚Äôve pursued I‚Äôm questioning that. \n\nI initially told her (late 30s F) that I was interested in children and she indicated she was open to it. However, she would make some random comments indicating children really aren‚Äôt for her. Going into dating her I knew it might be an impossibility just due to her age (also, I may have an undiagnosed narrow urethra). But with her comments, I knew continuing to pursue her meant no children. I was completely fine with that without an ounce of disappointment. We weren‚Äôt serious but I was thinking about the numerous bright sides to not having children. I thought, I‚Äôd be able to pour that time, money and energy into my partner instead for a deeper more fulfilling love. I think if you do it right, there‚Äôs the possibility to have more love and happiness than in a life with children. Plus not having the expenses and stresses on your relationship that inevitably come with raising children doesn‚Äôt sound terrible. \n\nUnfortunately, she ended things when things seemed from my perspective to be going well. I worry it might partially have been a perceived disconnect on children so best end it before it starts kinda thing - but she might have just not liked me. Idk, In any event and for whatever reason it just didn‚Äôt work out. \n\nMy main goal in dating is I want to find my best friend/partner. I don‚Äôt want to add conditions/exceptions to that - it‚Äôs already hard enough to find a best friend as an adult, and then you have to also want to make out with them, be with them all the time, be willing to take on their problems as your own, etc. It‚Äôs already a tall order. I don‚Äôt want to miss out on a potentially great partner because they want or don‚Äôt want kids. I‚Äôd embrace both options and go on that journey with them whole heartedly. \n\nNow going forward I don‚Äôt know what to put under family planning/children for the limited options on OLD apps (I‚Äôm on Hinge).\n\nI worry if I put ‚Äúwant‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want‚Äù that would result in half of potential matches immediately ignoring my profile (and wouldn‚Äôt be 100% genuine). I had thought ‚Äúopen to‚Äù or ‚Äúnot sure‚Äù could be the best options but my younger (pregnant) sister says it shows you don‚Äôt know what you want and women who want kids wouldn‚Äôt be interested. Is leaving the option blank a bad choice? \n\nMaybe I‚Äôm overthinking this, but I‚Äôm curious what the consensus is on the best option for a fence sitter. Thanks!",

        "text": "TL;DR - Looking for advice on how to deal with dieting on top of a heaping helping of working Mom burnout...\n\nI'm a 35F with three kids and a very, very demanding job.  At work I feel competent and capable and I mostly enjoy what I do, but overall I'm experiencing severe burnout.  I'm lucky if I find even one hour in each day to do what I want to instead of what has to be done (work, cleaning, cooking) and it just feels like my whole life is about labor rather than living.  I have a great partner, but he also has a very demanding job, plus travel.  When he's home, he chips in a lot but I'm here more than he is, so most housework falls on me.  \n\nWe're engaged and getting married next fall, so now the clock is ticking to get back down to my ideal weight on top of everything else.  I've cut out my daily coffee with creamer, which was a huge comfort to me.  And I've cut out most carbs (not quite keto yet, but getting there) so the foods we're eating now are limited.  I don't enjoy much that's actually low-calorie and healthy, so eating has become a chore.\n\nI've talked to my therapist about these changes and she feels it's a lot of restriction on top of how stressed and depressed I am, but I don't know how else to lose enough weight in time.  I'll be devastated if I can't get down at least 20 lbs. or so before the wedding and all the pictures, but it's been so hard to get going with working out.  My whole body aches most of the time, which she thinks is largely because of my severe stress.  I also have fairly severe endometriosis.\n\nSo, all that considered, I'm hoping for some advice on how to deal with dieting and exercise on top of the burnout that I know so many of us are dealing with now that life in general has become so generally unsustainable.  If anyone has any advice to share on how to work more comfort into the day I would be very grateful!  TIA!",

        "text": "Hey, so I'm grappling with feeling a particular way about my life and I'm wondering if anyone else has felt this way, and their opinions on this. \n\nI'm 29, and I never had many friends growing up. Even when I was in university, I graduated having made no friends. I tried so hard to, but failed anyway. When I got into the workforce, I tried making friends with coworkers and while they are nice to talk to, it seems like they all prefer to keep things at a superficial level, which I can respect. \n\nI decided to focus on cultivating my relationships with as many family members as possible. That kept me busy for a bit. Then the pandemic hit and during it, I had three grandparents pass away. This has lead to my family fragmenting and now I can pretty much count on never seeing my aunts or cousins again. \n\nI have a job that leaves me with a decent enough work/life balance that I have time I could spend on stuff. The problem is that after my failed attempts to deepen my relationships with others.... I seem to have very little going on in my life. Last year, I read 290 books. That's just sad. \n\nI have a great partner and we have fun together. We decided that we can't afford to have children, so that's not an option. We likely will never be able to afford a house and our apartment gets very little sunlight, so we can't garden and we're not allowed dogs. Those are two hobbies I would have liked that are out of reach. But we do have two cats and they are great. I also got into strength training for my health. I live in a small boring town where absolutely nothing happens.\n\nMy time outside of work is split between hanging out with my partner, playing with my cats, reading books and lifting weights. Lately I've been frustrated by reading about all these great adventures characters have. I want some of my own. Heck, I want to know what all these busy adults are doing all the time. I feel not needed and not important and like there is nothing good that I'm doing. Like I'm just wasting resources on this planet. I wish people would be excited because I was there and notice if I was missing, but outside of my immediate household, there are crickets. \n\nI decided to pick up a cheap wind instrument, and I've decided that I need to practice it everyday. My partner said he's happy to see me excited about something for the first time in a while. It felt good when I could finally play those four notes of the scale and have them sound right, too.  \n\nI cant shake the feeling that I'm only able to learn this because I have way too much free time on my hands because no one needs or wants me. This instrument is a replacement for friends and an extended family. And I can't see my life changing much, so I gotta learn to embrace this solitude. But it's hard. I feel like I did my life wrong.",

        "text": "I have a friend in San Francisco and I live in the suburbs of Atlanta. I've lived in NYC. I've traveled all over the world, but I simply prefer the suburbs. I'm very introverted and easily overwhelmed by sensory experiences and I like being close to my mom, close to trails (I like riding horses), and having tons of money to travel whenever and wherever I'd like.\n\nEvery time I talk with this friend, she spends the first ten minutes of the conversation making fun of my city, talking about how there must be nothing to do here, how it's a cultural and political wasteland, and how housing is \"so much cheaper\" here. Never mind that I'm the one organizing demonstrations to try to change the aspects of this city that truly are terrible.  \n\n\nI took a two-month long vacation to Europe and, when I got back, she said, \"You must be joking. Why would you voluntarily go back?\" After not talking to her for two months, we caught up again and when I talked about how I was moving to start a PhD program (in a small college town), she said something like, \"I'm glad you're getting out of that area. How could you ever be inspired there as an artist? But what's gonna happen? Am I just never gonna see you again? You're really planning on living there until your forties?\"\n\nI told her I was sick of her teasing me for living in a small town, that my mom was recovering from breast cancer and I was super glad I was there to help her, that I had no intention of overpaying for cost of living, and that--unlike other people--I didn't think living in a big city automatically qualified anyone for a personality. I'm a professional writer, so I told her I didn't need to be constantly surrounded by other artists for inspiration and that, if that were the case, I never would have made it in my field. She didn't respond but, the following day, sent me some article about \"surviving in a small town\" and I haven't responded. \n\nAm I being unreasonable or does she kind of suck? She's honestly been kind of a shitty friend my whole life--one of those mean-but-definitely-joking girlies--and I didn't realize it until I got better friends and they spent time with her and asked me why she was always making underhanded, snide, and mean comments to everyone at a party. These were other friends from NYC and LA, so it wasn't small-town naivete. She also applied to grad school and started trying to get her projects published directly after I did those things so I get the sense that she's either inspired or jealous of some aspects of my life despite how quiet it is sometimes.",

When I got back in the summer of 2020, I told myself it would be temporary. It‚Äôs nearly three years later and I‚Äôm so ready to leave, but nothing is pulling me in any direction. I feel stuck when I can go almost anywhere. \n\nI‚Äôm single and I work remotely (but it‚Äôs starting to feel isolating). This year, I have started house sitting for friends and family anywhere from two weeks to a month at a time to see how I feel about other cities. I hated the first city, but I really like the second city. I don‚Äôt have any other cities lined up at the moment. \n\nPart of me wants to pull the trigger and just move even if I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll settle in the next place. Tbh I‚Äôm not sure when I‚Äôll be ready to settle somewhere. However I‚Äôm also considering applying for some fellowships that could take me abroad or maybe a PhD program. Even if I did get into either of those, I wouldn‚Äôt have to move for another year. \n\nI told myself I‚Äôm going to have a self check in around June/July re: my job and my city. \n\nSO with that being said, can y‚Äôall share some stories about making big life transitions/changes in your 30s (or even later)? Tell me the good, tell me the bad. Thanks y‚Äôall!",

        "text": "Please help me unpack this - maybe an external perspective will help.\n\nI'm a woman, 39, and I really value friendships. For me nurturing friednships is more important right now (and really has always been) than having a relationship (I'm single and happily so).\n\nAside from my historical best friend (F38), who I have known since we were 6 and with whom I have the best relationship I could ever hope for, for many years I didn't have female friends and always missed it. I had a good circle of female friends in highschool and university, but when I moved abroad and started working in male-dominated sectors I struggled to make female friends. Recently I've spent more time on and off in my home village and made some new female friends, which I was over the moon about! I've always loved having male friends too, and still do, but there is something about a group of ladies together that is just unique.\n\nWhen I was younger I struggled at times with some potential female friendships due to the classic jealousy situation. At the time, I was very good looking (looking back I can now say this, I never felt it at the time!), and used to get a lot of male attention, this was usually the cause. Because I struggled with the male attention anyway, I started to develop \"strategies\" to discourage men while appearing less intimdating as possible to women: downplaying myself, pointing out my flaws, showing up scruffy, etc.\n\nThen with time I realised this is not a healthy strategy, and I actually need to be myself around friends and I do like to dress nicely and be put together. However, I kept my \"discouraging\" attitude towards male attention: I don't flirt, I think I actually forgot how to do it, and I don't try to appear sexy in any way or to make any even remotely sexual joke (unless with someone I'd like to be in a relationship or hook up with - very infrequent occurrance these days, because I'm also experiencing a time of celibacy for spiritual reasons). This helps me keep my male friends friends only and discourage them from developing sexual or romantic feelings towards me.\n\nFast forward to me finally having a good number of female friends. They are all in relationships, and those whose boyfriends I only know as their boyfriends everything is ok. However, there seem to be issues with those who get together with my male friends.\n\nOne female friend (35) asked me to introduce her to one of my long time male friends (32) and I did. They got together and it turned out a disaster, she got extremely jealous and told him I was saying horrible stuff about him to others, all starting because I sent him a text to organise a get together and she thought it was for me and him only. It wasn't, since they got together I immediately stopped hanging out with him alone, even though we had been close friends for five years, exactly for the reason of not wanting to cross any line. I also drastically reduced contact with him from weekly texts and phone calls, to only one phone call over a couple of months. This is just to say, I think I did absolutely nothing to make anyone alarmed. I kindly explained the invite was for both, but she thought I wanted him and was trying to make him fall for me, and demanded he stopped talking to me. He did and I accepted it, but I discovered later, this created a damage between them and they kept arguing about me (I had since disappeared from both of their lives, never reaching out to either of them), until they eventually broke up.\n\nNow, another female friend (42), and this one I really worshipped, has got together with one of my male friends (45). They are a gorgeous couple, so in love, both so bright and attractive, it's pure joy to see them together. Again, I've only hang out with them as a couple, never alone with him. He writes to me a bit more often than her and I make sure if I'm texting with him, I also text with her so that she doesn't feel I'm closer to him than her (even though I sort of was because I've known him longer). To organise hanging out I created a group chat to avoid misunderstandings, having learnt my lesson. And now, still, she's got really cold towards me and it turns out she feels threathened. She has started analyse my behaviour and found tiny clues that would indicate I'm interested in him, apparently I responded slightly faster to his texts than hers, but what really pissed her off was that he invited me to go out with him and a group of his friends while she was away for the weekend (I refused and didn't go). She's basically stopped talking to me.\n\nI'm starting to feel really hurt over this. Once was already a lot, but twice it means I'm obviously still doing something wrong, even taking all of these measures doesn't seem enough, and we are not kids, we are all over 35. The first lady I was only just getting to know her when the mess happened and we didn't have much in common, but this last one, I really cared about her and really opened up to her. I never had the faintest interest in her boyfriend, and never had the slightest flirty attitude towards him. I'm not even feeling that sexual lately at all and I'm quite disinterested in men in general these days, so it's not even something I have to force myself to do, I'm not oozing any kind of weird pheromone. Also this lady is stunning, way more good looking than me, so it can't be that. I'm now distancing myself from both to let them live their relationship in paece, but the male friend expressed that he is mortified by this, I suspect it will become an issue between them too. It feels absurd this is the second relationship I ruin wanting to do the complete opposite. I'm starting to feel I need to flee whenever two friends get together. I'm not overpresent in their lives either, I live part of the year abroad and when back I try to also catch up on family relationships and I spend a lot of time with my nephew and niece.\n\nIs there a blind spot I'm not noticing? Anyone with experience of this unvoluntary triangles?\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : In spite of my efforts, I keep causing jealousy and losing female friends that get in relationships with my male friends - what I am doing wrong?",

We don't know each other outside the context of one-on-one hang outs + casual sex, but we genuinely connect as friends and share respect. Last time we saw each other, they shared that the anniversary date of some past trauma is coming up. At first I wasn't going to bother them because we don't generally text except to plan our next hang out. They already have a strong personal support system and we're not close-close, so they don't necessarily need me reaching out.\n\nOn the other hand, I genuinely care for this person and know that these kind of anniversaries can be significant and tough.

But I also don't want it to be weird or like, too much coming from me.\n\n**So, is it weird to send my FWB a supportive text?

I think of the years in a row that I sat at $15 an hour for a trained/licensed position, I think of the years of never having health insurance, or any PTO, or retirement program, or any of it.  And I ran my ass off.   I think most people in caring professions do -- we are asked to have our souls scraped clean for pennies in return, anyone working in childcare, eldercare, health/disability care, teaching, medical, social work, all those \"Pink Collar\" professions.  I worked so hard and I was only rewarded with more work.  \n\nI finally make an \\*okay\\* wage but costs have gone up so much that I'm on the verge of not being able to cover my bills.  I have no kids, one pet, live in a 500 square foot house and I'm being squeezed on all sides.  My salary would be great if it was still 2019 but that's not the case.   Inflation is really killing me, like it is a lot of people and families.  \n\nIDK I'm just exhausted of female dominated professions leaning on our spouses to basically supplement our wage so we can have the 'Helper\" job and get paid garbage for it.  We literally had to sit thorugh a mandatory (corporate) meeting telling us that \"You Get Paid in Love &amp; Joy\" the subtext being that since we work with animals that should be the pay itself.  \n\nI'm admittedly burned out on the idea that somehow our work is worth less because...I'm actually not sure why that is.

        "text": "So, I (31F) recently, and rather embarrassingly, injured my foot by trying to walk while it was asleep from sitting on it. I stumbled, caught myself with my sleeping foot, and my body weight fell directly onto my foot, which landed sideways. Amazingly, my ankle is fine, but my foot is not. It hurt so bad, I felt it through the \"sleepiness.\" This happened yesterday. At first, I thought it would go away as the day went on, but several hours later, I still had to walk with just the inside of my injured foot, as putting weight on any area from the middle toe outward hurts. A day later, I'm still walking funky to avoid the pain. \n\nI'm trying my best to take care of it. I've had foot injuries as a kid. I know to elevate it, take ibuprofen, and stay off it as much as possible. But as a kid, that was easy. I had no obligations, no responsibilities, and parents who saw to it that I was taken care of. \n\nNow I'm 31. I have a husband. We share household responsibilities and I feel absolutely *useless*. It's depressing and I feel guilty that I'm not able to contribute as much right now. I've had to ask favors of him more than I'd like. I can't drive right now because it's my right foot, so he's had to run two errands that I'd otherwise be fine to take care of. I couldn't unload the dishwasher yesterday. It was my turn to do dishes, but he had to do that half of the chore since I wasn't going to try to hobble around the kitchen to put everything away. And on top of it, he had a really, *really* shitty day yesterday too. So not only was he dealing with his own issues (including multiple calls to the hellscape that is Amazon's customer service hotline), but he was also catering to me. \n\nMy husband is amazing and he has not once made me feel guilty or acted put out by my injury. It's all coming from me. So I guess I'm seeking advice for how to cope with being injured as an adult. How do I deal with the guilt and helplessness and uselessness that comes with not being as mobile as I usually am?",

        "text": "I'm really interested in your stories. How have you been treated by your family over the years? How do you feel about it? How does it reflect in your relationship with your family today? \n\n********\nI ask these questions because I keep wondering if there is something wrong with me...\n\n\nI grew up away from my extended family due to my parents' jobs. I grew up quickly and became known as \"an old soul\" as a result of the need to step up due to a sibling's health issue. As a result, my relationship with my extended family is much different than those of my cousins and their children. My relationship with my parents was more of their friend and confidant than their child.\n\nI married my high school sweetheart right after graduation. We put ourselves through college, bought a house and had a baby all before 21. We worked our asses off. We were the first and only children of our families to attend and graduate college for over 10 years. When money was tight, we found alternative sources of income to make it work. At this point, we've had multiple children, bought/sold multiple homes across the country as our careers took us new places, and supported each other through multiple health related issues.\n\nThrough the years, we've watched as our families bought vehicles, homes, provided childcare, room &amp; board, covered court costs for divorces and child custody hearings, and paid for college tuition for our siblings. We've watched as grandparents showed up for their other grandkids and were in active relationships with them. All while there seemed to little interest in our lives or the lives of our children. We've told ourselves throughout the years that we're lucky: We're lucky because we haven't been in situations where we needed that kind of help. Our kids don't have the same relationship with their grandparents because their grandparents didn't have to raise them for any period of their lives. We're lucky because our success is ours alone. We're lucky because we've been able to step in and help siblings and extended family when they needed it- because we could.\n\nHowever, in a recent and completely unrelated conversation with one of our parents, it came out that the reasons why we didn't receive the same level of consideration when starting out our adult lives is because we were independent; we never struggled; we never asked for help. The entire conversation, despite the light-hearted nature of the conversation itself, made me irrationally angry. No one asked us how we were through those years. We were FT students who waited tables to make ends meet. We started off poor. We survived on ramen noodles. We burnt the candle at both for ends for the first decade of our marriage to get where we are today. Nothing was easy. Maintaining a healthy marriage and raising babies while building a career isn't easy. \n\nTruth is, my anger and resentment has next to nothing to do with money and gifts. It has everything to do with consideration and acknowledgement that it wasn't fucking easy for us, and the only reason they pretend it was is to make themselves feel better about it all. My resentment is related to the relationship we could have had if we weren't just regarded as \"the easy ones\"- out of sight and out of mind. Children should never be the ones begging for relationships with their parents. Even more so, grandchildren are not responsible for building a relationship with their grandparents.\n\nThe most unfortunate part of it all is that as our parents and extended family age, I feel little to no responsibility for stepping up to help them. I should feel a connection and an obligation to make plans for their future care and their future needs, but I can't help, but feel like there are others who owe them this. It makes me feel like such a shitty person. Maybe I need to suck it up and forget about all of it because our history doesn't matter? It's not like I even want a badge of honor or a certificate for making our own way, so why does it all still bother me so much? Maybe I really am just a shitty person afterall. Seems a better person would be able to move on and not be bothered by any of this after all of these years.",

She also rambled on about why she thinks \"it's terrible society lets ladies think it's okay to abort babies or possible babies in any way.\"\n\nIt's a testament to how much we have grown apart that she doesn't know how staunchly pro-choice I am. I broke up with a best friend last year over their pro-forced birth viewpoints.\n\nI responded to her email this morning and I really let her have it. I was very mean. I said hurtful things about her mental health (she has brain damage from too many psychedelics in college). I went on and on about her privilege as a wealthy white woman who has never had so work for anything in her life. I yelled about how one of my close friends almost died a couple months ago because of anti-abortion legislation in my state. I yelled about the eleven year old in my state who was raped by her brother and forced to have the baby. \n\nI have been so angry and I let all that anger out on her. And now that my nervous system has calmed down, I am feeling pretty shitty. \n\nAnyone want to remind me why Planned Parenthood picketers are awful people?

However I clicked immediately with her, talked for hours, all that good stuff. I've seen her twice since. I think I quite like her, but its obviously very early days and so I'm still figuring out exactly how I feel and just sort of enjoying the dates at the moment.\n\nThe thing that's really throwing me is how keen she is (best word i can think of sorry). She's told me she gets nervous around me and hasnt felt like that in many years, she brought a camera on our last date to take some photos of us together, after I left last time I got messages saying that the house felt very empty without me there, sends me romantic type songs she's been listening to.. As I'm typing this out I feel a bit silly but it all feels like a lot for knowing each other for such a short amount of time, even though my friends have said that they would love to meet someone who was so into them and clear about it.\n\nI just wondered if anyone out there is like me and takes a long time to form a connection and dealt with dating someone apparently the total opposite. I don't want to put her off or pull away (my normal reaction to this kind of situation) because I think something may be there over time, but I don't know yet. I worry that me not saying anything gives the impression I'm also super into her and its going to feel terrible if one day I decide its not what I'm after - but also, I'd feel awful saying anything to her now because I think it's just her personality and one day maybe I WILL want this level of affection. Just not yet. I'm starting to feel more anxious about leading her on than enjoying the journey of getting to know each other. \n\nSorry for the super long read, think I just want to get this out in a space that isn't my friends just telling me to be grateful to have found someone genuine lol.

        "text": "I (35F) have always disliked my name. My first name is an extremely old sounding name and my middle name is common, think \"Grace Elizabeth\" *(\\*not my name lol).* I never felt like my name fit me, and for a brief while in 3rd grade I went by something similar to \"Grace-Beth\". I stopped going by it because my family ignored it and kept calling me \"Grace\".\n\nNow \"Grace\" doesn't bother me as much anymore, I've made peace with it. But part of me wishes I played around more with other nicknames or even going by \"Elizabeth\" or using nicknames for that. After the past few years I have been lifeless and unproductive, and the past few months I feel like I'm making positive changes but sometimes feel like old patterns and thoughts are holding me back (bad stuff from childhood, etc.). Part of me wonders if subconsciously there is so my trauma tied to me as \"Grace\", it's holding me back. \n\nI don't even have a set name, but when I googled nicknames for \"Grace\", I saw (something similar to) \"Gigi\", which the more I think about the more I like. I could go back to Grace Beth, but meh, not feeling it.\n\nAnd how would that work logistically? If it's a nickname I wouldn't have to change any legal docs. Would I just change all my social media names? Introduce myself to new people as \"Gigi\"? At work I'm fine with them calling me \"Grace\" (because I'm trying to leave...), but when applying for new jobs, should I change it on my resume? Is Gigi a weird nickname for Grace? lol. Am I too old to do this at 35? And to be clear, I'm not 100% like \"I have to change my name\", it's more of an idea.\n\n\\*Grace is a lovely name! I couldn't find a similar example to use for this post!! üòÅ \n\n\\*\\*I also watched season 4 of You last week, where one of the characters (Kate) changed her name to get a fresh start. That also might be why it's fresh in my mind",

I know that the answer is yes, but this just happened and I'm looking to some internet strangers for support....\n\nI met a guy traveling ~4 years ago who lived in my city at the time. I saw him once every week, and things were good idk we did regular date activities. Then we started traveling together (but nothing was ever official). Over covid we got really close, talking all the time, he came over my apartment a lot once restrictions let up. Things got more and more \"serious,\" without ever being a relationship. We started having serious talks about our feelings last May (and spent most of the summer together), but I was never able to feel secure, and kept reacting strongly to random things he'd say that would trigger those feelings of insecurity. I told him last week that I needed more security in the relationship, and that was where it ended. He somehow said \"you're the biggest priority in my life\" and \"I always think about you first\" and ended things when I asked for a relationship where we have a future in the same conversation. \n\nI go between being okay with it / being relieved it's over to feeling like I'm dying. We traveled so much together, he'd rent beautiful hotels he knew I'd like, would prioritize anything I asked for, was emotional support, rewrote my fucking college essay, called me whenever good things would happen in his life to share them.

If I don't get a job, I have a few more months of financial runway before I will have to give up my lovely apartment in Los Angeles and move in with my parents on the East Coast. Even if I do find something and can stay... I love a lot about this city, but I moved here from NYC mostly for my ex, my whole social circle here was his friends, and I have very little support or community here. Luckily one of my BFFs from college lives around the corner but beyond that, nada. I'm pretty introverted and not a natural connector, and have always found friends by being 'adopted' by an extrovert and brought into their crew. \n\nI would like to find a new partner eventually and am finding dating here veryyyy rough going. It was a breeze in my 20s in NYC - I'm not sure if it's the 30something scene, a post-pandemic vibe shift, LA itself? It also seems like it will be very hard to truly move on knowing my ex is right around the corner, especially as I know he spends a lot of time in my neighborhood.\n\nI am super grateful to be able to go crash at my parent's house, but I am not a big fan of the part of New England where they live/where I grew up, and am worried my mental health will suffer if I spend more than 6 or so months there. (On the bright side, I do still have some friends from childhood and high school there.)  I could go home, regroup, save money, and move again, but I'm not sure where - NYC no longer appeals for many reasons and I'm not sure LA is right for me, either. On top of all of this, I am questioning my career choices and wondering if I should go back to school - not that I have any idea what I would do - and I don't even know how to begin sorting that out. \n\nI've never been very good at envisioning the future or making goals and plans, and that's hitting hard right now. I feel completely adrift with no signs to guide me. Thoughts? Wisdom? Advice?",

I went to the office to meet my boss (male, late 40s) and collect my laptop. During the day, he mentioned a company he worked at in the past, and I said I‚Äôd worked with someone from there before. He asked their name and promptly had a meltdown when I said it. He went pale, repeated ‚Äúthis is not good‚Äù, four times, then we went straight into a meeting. \n\nDisturbed, I texted my ex coworker to find out what on earth was going on. She told me he made a crude joke about her getting an STD in a meeting, and was generally creepy and inappropriate with women in the office. \n\nToday, I had an intro meeting with a woman on my team who is leaving the company in a week. Completely unprompted, she told me to watch out for him, and called him a predator, and said he had a ‚Äòtype‚Äô that I fit (we both have dark curly hair). \n\nFeeling nauseous, I reached out to my onboarding buddy and told her everything. She reassured me that she doesn‚Äôt see him as predatory, and shed light on what happened with the woman I‚Äôd spoken to earlier that day. Needless to say, it still paints him in a questionable light. She also shared that she thought he was a ‚Äòpig‚Äô when she joined, and wanted to leave, but has since changed her mind. \n\nI feel totally unable to move past this. Reflecting on Monday in the office with him, he said two things that at the time seemed harmless, but now make me pause. He tried to figure out my age, and asked how long I had been with my boyfriend.",

        "text": "Ladies of Reddit, how do you get yourself, your stomach and your sleep back to normal after travel?\n\nWhen I was younger I could travel, eat anything I wanted, drink all day all night, then come home and phase right back into my regular routine pretty easily. Now I'm almost 40, haven't travelled in a while, and these trips got my sleep and digestive system all messed up. \n\nI did an all inclusive to Mexico a month ago and came back feeling it. Hungover, bloated and sunburnt. Then found out I had to go to California for a family funeral last week. Weather was horrible so lots of eating (humongous american portion sizes) and not enough walking. \n\nTook the red-eye home, but I couldn't sleep on the plane so got home at 7am and crashed hard. Slept all day, woke up at 2pm then fell asleep on the couch 4-6pm. Now I'm not tired at night, I'm jetlagged, bloated, constipated, full of gas and so uncomfortable. Plus my skin is still messed up, all over my face and body white stuff is flaking off no matter how much I lotion and drink water.\n\nWhat can I do to get things back on track? I work from home nowadays so I don't have the same 'go to work' that used to snap me back into a regular routine. Other than drink water, lotion and go back to my high fibre old woman cereal, I have no idea how to bring myself back from this. \n\nPlease give me advice on how to make myself right again.",

I stopped running due to the pain. \n\nI‚Äôm now 42, a normal weight for my height and I can only walk, swim and lift upper body weights for exercise. Otherwise my injuries become aggravated and cause me pain. Which stinks because I‚Äôd love to do some other things. My husband is a runner and wishes I could run with him like we used to. \n\nIs this just a normal thing as we get older, something to accept and work around?",

My mom and my husband‚Äôs parents watch my daughter through the week. I can produce just enough breast milk, but after 8 months, I may have to do a very little bit of supplementing with formula to help out. Pumping is soooooo time consuming. I feel like between pumping, working and taking care of myself and my daughter, i have soooo little time to help my husband with dinner. He‚Äôs been almost the sole cook in the house since I was pregnant. I tend to do chores that involve picking things up, like groceries or any other needs. It takes me away some, but I strategize. I just get this sick feeling sometimes that my mom/our parents are raising our daughter more than we get to because I work 9-5. I feel like if anyone spends the most hours of her waking life with her, it should be me, so I feel like I need to constrict my non-baby time on the weekends to small windows. To do that I‚Äôd have to give up anything that isn‚Äôt work. Only some of our friends have kids. I want to see my friends, but and worried we‚Äôll lose the childless people, though nothing supports that belief with the people we know from what I‚Äôve seen. I just want to spend time with her so badly, but I don‚Äôt want to be a friendless shut in. \n\nI‚Äôve never loved another human so much, not that I don‚Äôt love my husband and the rest of my family, but this is a whole other level. I just need her to KNOW who mommy is. Now she calls out ‚Äúmama‚Äù to me when I walk by on my way out to work, and it‚Äôs so hard not to stop and just stay with her. She‚Äôs 8 months old now. Does this get easier? Does anyone remember this feeling when their kids were this young? Do your friends stay around, just maybe we see them less frequently? I don‚Äôt know how to fit in a workout during the winter. I like taking EARLY morning walks in the summer months, and think I‚Äôll do this before she wakes up many days to stay in shape and not lose waking hours with her. \n\nI don‚Äôt know if my worry over not being THE mommy in her life is ridiculous, or if I‚Äôm being over sensitive, or in grief of some perceived loss of time with her. \n\nTo the mom‚Äôs with older kids looking back at this time in your life, how does it go?",
