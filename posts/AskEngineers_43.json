        "text": "For context I'm a student currently in my second year of Electromechanical engineering, doubling in programming.   \n\n\nRecently I've been hanging out a lot with people whose stream of studying leans more towards humanities. I often hear them speak about different cultures, being aware and passionate about problems and willing to bring change. I really admire this and look up to them.  \n\n\nI suppose in a way this is making me overthink the whole engineering thing. I never was a big fan of the rat race and the corporate world. I always wanted to be creative, be a good person and change the world for the better.   \n\n\nSo I was wondering if we really can change the world, or am I studying just to be another cog in an emotionless machine without a personality, exploiting the same world I swore myself to change?",

        "text": "I’m working on a personal design project (HUD) and I’m having a heck of a time wrapping my head around this. I understand it sort of but not entirely when it comes to “if I change x parameter, it will effect y this way”      \n\n\nThis is how I believe it works, based on random internet digging:     \n\nThe image has to be reflected off a half-mirrored/half see through glass (***a dichroic mirror***).      \n\nThe glass has to be mirrored on the side facing the viewer and the glass needs to be spherical (***so a dichroic concave mirror***).     \n\nThe viewers eyeball has to be at the focal distance of the lens? Or does this not matter?     \n\nThe image being reflected onto the dichromic glass needs to be positioned at the focal distance of the lens (and positioned on the concave side). This can or can’t be moved in distance from the lens? I assume can’t.      \n\nAssuming these three(displayed image, lens, eyeball) are linked by angles, does the angle of them matter? My brain tells me as long as the displayed image is positioned at the focal point of the lens and it (the image) and the eye are positioned at the angle of reflection (is this the correct term?) then it doesn’t care what angles are used as long as they adhere to those rules. ?       \n\nAppreciate any response on this. While this post is a little clunky, I tried to explain it how my brain thinks it operates in terms of a balanced (i.e. *correctly functioning*) system. Thanks for reading!",

I know it's leaking because I open up to 100 psi, cut off the source and observed that after 1 hour, there's only ~40 psi left.\n\nI'm concerned because if the system is not sealed, then it means N2 is constantly released into the room while the equipment is being used. Also, the lab is an enclosed space and multiple people use it during the day, so I'm not feeling comfortable with having N2 leaking throughout the room.\n\nIs there a way to solve this issue? I'm thinking of installing an oxygen monitor to alert people when the oxygen concentration in the room is low, but I don't think it's a good idea to ask people to leave the room while they're working on the machine.\n\nThanks for the help.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/z20yuc/how_do_flow_rate_and_differential_pressure_change/",
        "text": "Lets say I am flowing water through a filter and all of the water that flows into the filter also exits the filter. I can measure the differential pressure across the filter, and I can also measure the flowrate in and out of the filter. We know that flowrate is proportional to the sqrt(dp). How do the flowrate and dp change as a function of mass loaded onto the filter? \n\nIn other words, if I have a clean filter, i.e. no mass has been loaded onto the filter, then there will be almost no restriction to the flow, and therefore a small pressure drop. As this filter loads, the restriction will become greater and if the flowrate is maintained constant, than the dp will increase proportional to the square of the flowrate. \n\nI am trying to figure out how mass plays into this relationship. For example...\n\nIf I loaded a filter with 1 lbm of material at 100 gpm and 10 psid across the filter, how much material could I hope to load if instead I was operating at 200 gpm and 10 psid? I would expect to hold less material, but how much less? Would it be half as much material? a quarter? \n\n\nOn one hand, I am trying to use Bernoulli to reason through this, but can't seem to figure out how mass (a restriction to flow) comes into play.\n\nI am also trying to think of it as an electrical analogy via V = I*R where V is like pressure, I is like flowrate, and R is like mass. \n\nHow would you go about thinking about this, and are there any resources to help me think about this?",

I need a second (or third, or fourth...).\n\nI took these back in September. Do you think this is safe? I've taken a number of photos, and although I lack some overall photos, the ones I took show the most severe damage.\n\nFor clarification, this is a multi-level parking garage; it is a 4 level (plus basement) structure. My photos are from the second floor. I will also note that the entire stairway area is cracked and bleeding rust.\n\nPhoto 1: From Google Street.

If it's bad, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being call 911 and make a stink about it until they're forced to respond, how bad is it?\n3.

        "text": "So, I'm making a camera that I want to utilize a rotary spring wound timer for controlling the shutter. Basically, I want to turn the dial about 270 degrees, and have the timer close after about 60 seconds. \n\nI started by looking for a supplier of a 30-60 second rotary spring wound timer first, because I want essentially exactly what my capresso infinity burr grinder uses, but can't find a parts list for it and don't want to take it apart to look for it (I use it every day). It's prefect because it has the resolution I want (0-60s), and it doesn't engage the spring until about a 10-15 degree turn of the dial, which would be great for an instant shutter close. I know after being in manufacturing for a while you start to see where parts are sourced from and I'm hoping someone out there has a supplier in mind for such a niche thing!\n\nBut, if I can't find a supplier my backup is to learn how it works and just make it! I have a 3d printer at my disposal and I have a mech. engineering background, so I'm not afraid of doing some math to get something working. Any DIYs, mechanism teardowns, or general advice on where to start with design would be so so helpful!",

I thought I could get a rebar (0,5 inch) cage, cement it into the ground (on top of a cement block - clay soil) and then put the pole inside the cage. I want to sink the cage approx 30 inches into the ground. I want the poles to be approx 90 inches taller than ground level (the shortest is 80 inches long) so the rebar cage (and wooden box to contain the concrete) would need to extend above ground (see [images](https://imgur.com/a/nfOg9xr)).\n\nI want to know: what is the least distance the pole should extend into the rebar cage to be structurally sound. I have some thoughts about how to secure the poles at different heights within the rebar cage (before cement is poured in the entire wooden box), but suggestions here are welcome too.",

The other day I noticed my thermostat dropped below temp and I heard a whirring. Checked the water sight and it was at 1/4 so by design it did not fire on. I noticed that the display on the VXT was flashing, I hit the FEED switch and the boiler fired up, but then the screen went blank and the FEED switch doesn't work. It seems to me like it lost power but I can't understand how. Can anyone possibly walk me through taking the cover off and what to look for inside before I have a service call out?",

The amount of deceleration that occurs throws you forward, and it feel like the plane could tuck at the slightest misalignment. Yet I've seen videos of similar planes landing at near 45 degree angles during gnarly crosswinds that don't have any oscillations in their track after touching down.\n\nWhat am I missing that makes the planes stability so unintuitive? Is this a controls problems, and the plane takes over to maintain stability? Or is the pilot solely responsible for control?",

It needs to be variable speed and run ideally up to 15mph, but up to 10mph would suffice if needed. Most of the videos ive seen online for water tunnels are quite slow and used for aerodynamics, but here that isnt a concern, we just need the water to be running at a constant high speed throughout the tank. ideally the tank will be 4ft long x 2 ft wide x 2 ft high       \n        \nMy first idea is to use 2 pumps running to a bunch of pvc splitters, which will become a wall of pipes going into either end of the tank, and put a pump on each end, One which pulls water from the testing tank, and goes into the top of another 40 gallon reservoir, and the over pump which pulls the water from the bottom of the reservoir, and into the testing tank. Im not quite sure the math behind this to calculate the power of pump needed, so was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction, as well as if you have any tips either for this idea, or another direction to go in. Any thoughts are very much appreciated!         \n           \nCrude diagram:               \nhttps://i.imgur.com/VedrRGm.png",

So like in an X-ray telescope: is the inside covered with micro crystals with some simple orientation like 100 or 111 ?\n\nI expect the original gamma photons to be thermalised into X-ray photons suited for Bragg reflection.

However, there will also be a non-insignificant amount of axial loading, so I've placed a thrust bearing in between the miter gear and bevel box to support this force and reduce friction from the back face of the gear as it spins.  Here is a section view of the relevant bearing stack [pic](https://i.imgur.com/Nl4JfgC.png).\n\nMy concern is around the potential added friction between the ID of the thrust bearing and the OD of the rotary shaft.  Since the face of one thrust washer is pressed against the bevel box (which is fixed relative to the rotation of the shaft) and the other washer is pressed against the miter gear (which rotates with the shaft), the shaft will basically just be scraping along the inside of washer on the box side.

Are there other ways of accomplishing the same thing that would eliminate this concern (assuming its valid)?\n\nThanks!",

However, I am not from a wealthy background and I want to make sure that I have a degree which I can rely upon if something happens to my pilot career. \n\nI am really confused between mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. I want to graduate in the most versatile engineering degree and a degree which can land me a decent paying job in starting if I have to leave commercial flying. Also which is the better degree if I want to do masters in aerospace/aeronautics.",

How can you accurately measure a liquid that is tilting? \n\nI understand gas tank floats are inaccurate when cornering as the liquid is not level. Is there a method to calculate liquid volume at all times regardless if the surface of the liquid is orthogonal to gravity. \n\nIt seems the obvious answer would be pressure sensors but it seems that sensors would be needed at multiple areas. \n\nIs there a simple way to calculate the volume of a liquid in a container that is being tilted in non-specific orientations?",

In short, a tank full of stock is overflowing and we need to generate a rough cost/ benefit analysis. \n\nThe tank is large and cylindrical. Near the top there is a 16” horizontal overflow pipe which connects to a 90 elbow and subsequently a vertical pipe. [here’s](https://imgur.com/gallery/u6XFrML) a crude drawing. \n\nTheres a pressure sensor in the tank so i can calculate the water level. The dimensions of the tank are also known. What sort of model/equations can i use to roughly calculate the flow based on the level in the tank?",
