        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/94twlh/a_discussion_of_roberto_bolanos_the_savage/",
        "text": "So I recently finished reading *The Savage Detectives*, which is one of the best books I've read in a long time. There are a lot of different ways to take the novel, since it seems so directionless and disjointed, so I'm interested what other people thought of it. To me though, the novel is a revel in the absolute futility of literature. Which sounds like nonsense, especially considering most of the characters are poets, critics, novelists, publishers and whatnot, but everything about the structure convinces me that none of the characters ever grasp the reality they seek, and have found contentment in that.\n\nYou can look at Ulises Lima and Arturo Belano as the opposite of this, the \"artists\" that no one wants to be. They're the founders of the Visceral Realists, a movement with no clear aim but believing that true realism needs something more that no art has ever achieved before. They rarely produce any writing, establish awards in the name of unknown writers, print a magazine with an unknown publisher, idolize one poet (Cesarea Tinajero) who may not even exist. They're the joke of established poets and publishers everywhere. And unlike established poets, they're unsatisfied with the state of literature all around the world. They brush off Paz, Neruda, Borges, etc. for no discernible reason, and end up kicking most people out of the Visceral Realist movement for being too sympathetic of poetry as it is. When asked why they do this, they're incapable of giving a reason. They are, by most definitions, very bad poets.\n\nHowever, other characters pay attention to them because they believe Lima and Belano act in ways that are literarily interesting. They travel the world seeking what they believe to be the purest form of art, which other characters find admirable to some degree. Octavio Paz's meeting with Lima reveals that even the most legendary of modern Latin American poets admires Visceral Realism, even though the tension between their philosophies on art are so strong that all Paz and Lima do is walk miserably in circles around each other. Neither will reach the heart of reality with their art, and believe in Visceral Realism as the next step toward unknowing. This is why the works by Lima and Belano are never shown to the reader; their poetry has nothing to teach. Their real poetry is their embodiment of the values of literature within themselves. And while a lesser novel would make characters like this seem godlike and impossible the understand (or, better yet, non-existent), the novel makes them real people, who consistently fail on their journey. The immortalized Cesarea Tinajero is treated the same way, who turns out to be a washmaid in the middle of the desert whose eyes soak up all the light around her. Whether this means Visceral Realism failed is ultimately nebulous; Lima, Belano, and Tinajero are unsatisfied with their work, but their work demonstrates that no measure of embodiment (even to the point of drawing the universe into your eyes) can achieve a pure art.\n\nOne character comes close in the form of Juan Garcia Madero. After Lima and Belano leave him and Lupe in the desert, his journal shows him to go on living in impossible conditions for about a month. He too has given up on Visceral Realism, but he ends his journal making bizarre entries involving place names and windows. So with the \"What's outside the window?\" bit; I think the window is a boundary between the reality of the novel and that of the reader. So much of the book is about how audiences see art, and how ridiculous it is that art aims to be anything when so many people see art differently (i.e. the chapter where each narrator ends a story by saying \"Every story that starts as a comedy ends as _______\"). The Visceral Realists act in such nonsensical ways that they cannot reason for, as they try to reject reason as a concept. Rejection of reason acknowledges the futility of interpreting art, and opens art to all possible perspectives. The perforation in the window at the end is the result of this opening; the perception of art more and more as like our own reality, excruciating, never quite there.\n\nI've barely scratched the surface of how complex these themes get in the novel, and I got really excited writing about it so most of this post probably doesn't make much sense. I'm just excited to hear other people's perspectives on it, especially since, to me, that's the main point of the book.",
