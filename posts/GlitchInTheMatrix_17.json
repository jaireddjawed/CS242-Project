        "text": "When I was a kid, I really liked Duran Duran. I thought their music was catchy and fun, and it sounded different from other music during the 90s. I would ask my parents to tune the radio to the pop station just to see if a Duran Duran Song was playing. \n\nBefore school one day, I tuned the radio from the passenger seat to Mix 100.5 and there was chatter from the radio host about recent events in my area, then he played a song that was really out of place. The tune wasn't like anything I've ever heard before. It had the new wave and synth pop elements that made up Duran Duran's style, but it sounded otherworldly. Simon Le Bon began singing, and the lyrics were really unusual for a Duran Duran song. The usual uplifting nature was replaced by a more serious and straightforward tone. It's been a long time, and I can't remember exactly what the lyrics were, but I can remember that they were about loneliness. \n\nWhen the song ended, I was blown away. I wanted to know if this new song was just hitting the radio, and where I could hear it again. The DJ finally cut the audio from the song off and said \"And that was 'Midnight Ride' by Duran Duran\". I thought it was something to go off of, but I couldn't seem to find the song anywhere. Not on any of their albums, no mention of it in any magazines, not even on the radio again. Years later, when YouTube started becoming more popular, I did a search for the song and nothing came up. I came to realize that this song doesn't exist. It wouldn't just vanish. Duran Duran doesn't have many songs to begin with, and they were too big at the time for this song to go unnoticed. My mom doesn't even remember what I was talking about and claims it was a different song playing.",

For the past 2 months I've been wondering if my entire life is just a dream. Recently I discovered this twitter page: twitter.com/wakeupfast (It's telling you to wake up from a coma) One of the posts on the twitter page said \"How often are coincidences happening?\" Ever since I've been noticing a ton of weird stuff happen. 2 times with the SAME person at school I was about to say a word in my head and then that person says that word, again at school I heard some people talking behind me and I didn't exactly know what they were saying but I thought I heard someone say 'ding ding' and that gave me a thought about someone going on the intercom and saying something funny and while I was thinking about that the intercom went on (nobody said anything funny but still), there was an episode of the simpsons where they were making a joke about how every sports team is called the wildcats. at the same time I was Buzzfeed because I wanted to see a quiz cuz I was bored and then I saw a thumbnail of someone in a wildcats jersey, also an episode of American dad was on about how all of their vacations were fake and they were all in a vat being simulated (kinda sounding familiar?) also a couple years back I realized that I was going to die one day and an episode of Family Guy came on of stewie having an existential crisis (both episodes sorta related to my situations played during my situations), a really big one is that I also saw an ad on reddit about a new hulu show called Marvels Runaways and the ad said 'What if everything you thought you knew, you didn't know at all?' (sounds similar?) well I thought it was weird but then my dad turned on the TV and a wolverine ad came on (both ads about superheroes) also one of the actors is Virginia Gardner. I live in the state of Virginia (also Gardner, VA is a real place). Last night I got an ad about going to Southern West Virginia and I was also thinking about going there because I was reading a book called 'Rocket Boys' and they were mentioning Coalwood, WV (btw I didn't even know coalwood was even in south wv) and also Gardner, VA is literally near Coalwood, WV. I sorta feel like I'm going insane. Should I give up on finding answers? I don't know. I just hope you guys can help me out. Just please give me a logical explanation for all of this.",

My mom asked what I wanted on my cake this year.\nI wanted trippy mushrooms to celebrate my last year of my 20s.\nWell guess I got my wish.\n\nOkay, so, here goes. \n\nWe were in St Augustine, FL for my birthday with a couple of friends, walking through the oldest city in the the US. \nWe were continuing our tradition of their Nights of Lights Celebration.\nWell, we all checked the time when we parked in the parking garage 1st floor. 9:04 is what our phones said. One of our friends said, at one point riding from our house, their iPhone said 9:30-something. Everyone we talked to on the street said it was 10:04. Odd. \nWe didn't think too much of it. Technology glitches. \n\nOr so we thought...\nAs we walked we got pictures. \n\nOur path took us by Tolomato Cemetery about one block away from St. George Street. We walked by it leaving the parking garage; we walked by it going back. I could feel other presences (ghost/spirit) our first pass through. Our second pass has less traffic; My boyfriend and I took recordings of the graveyard. (Another side theory there)\n\nWell, as we left St. George Street and we're going back towards the parking garage, it happened again!! But...\nThis time, it was bouncing between 10:42 and 11:42 on all devices at several instances.\nI have photo proof for one of the instances on the walk back. 11:42 is the correct hour time. My phone is in 2400 format. My bf took a screen shot of his camera app that showed all three devices time. My weather app on my phone showed the correct time but my cell itself showed an hour behind. \nFriends have a iPhone with iOS 11\nBoyfriend ZTE with Marshmallow Android 6\nMine LG with Nougat Android 7\nBoyfriend and I have Boost Mobile \nFriends have Sprint\n\nTell me what you think happened on my birthday. How would you explain this \"anomaly?\"\n",

        "text": "Okay, first time posting here, so hi everyone! \nI'll just jump in to keep it short:\n\nEvery once in a while I recall something really strange that happened to me. When I was younger, every Christmas and Thanksgiving we would go to my Great Aunt's house. I still remember everything about this damn house. The first floor is basically set up like a circle with a block in the middle. So, no closed rooms basically. The front door opens into the living room, the living room leads into this weird hallway sort of thing, this hallway leads into the dining room and then the kitchen, and then front door again. In the weird hallway thing, there is a door that leads outside to the pool, and parallel to this door there is another one, door against the block in the middle of the \"circle\". \nNow, I remember DISTINCTLY trying to sneak up those stairs to see what was upstairs because I was always bored out of my mind at my Great Aunt's. And every time she would yell at me to not go up there. The furthest I got was maybe 2 or 3 steps before she would catch me. But I remember-- white door, dark brown steps, and two doorways on either side of the stairs. \nSo, fast forward to a few years ago, I visited my Great Aunt's place again and I wanted to check out the door for old time's sake. But there was one problem. You guessed it, folks! The flipping door was gone. Just..not there. Completely flat. White wall. No evidence it was there. I asked my sister about the door, she doesn't remember it. Asked my parents...they don't remember it either. \nBut I know that it was there. I wasn't THAT young to have just made it up...I was maybe 8 or 9 at the time the door was there. \n\nEvery so often I think of the door and just get so creeped out. \nHas anyone experienced anything similar to this?

        "text": "Basically, I've been going through a lot of doubt over the past 2 years or so. I made a lot of changes in my life and eventually last August I moved to Mobile, Alabama for a job and ended up not getting paid right, so I moved back, got kicked out of my old house in Statesville, North Carolina due to a miscommunication with my landlord and told I wasn't welcome there anymore. I had nowhere to stay, so I ended up being homeless for a bit and eventually a friend of mine that my band recorded with offered a room at the house he lives at. I moved there last November and then eventually fell into the biggest and darkest depression I've ever faced. For the first time in my life I felt completely abandoned, alone and powerless. I fell into a huge existential/identity crisis and kept fearing that I was bipolar, schizophrenic, the only human in the universe, felt like I didn't exist, etc. very scary stuff.\n\nSo anyway, one morning I had been up all night getting high and crying out to the void. I started getting hungry and realized that the only money I had for food at that time was a Panera Bread gift card my mom got for me back at Christmas.  As I parked my car and headed towards the cafe, I noticed a man in his 50s dressed in a white button-up shirt and black slacks headed towards his car which parked directly next to mine. We exchanged greetings and I asked him how his morning was. He replied \"Well it would be better if I could find my keys. I think I left them in Panera.\" I told him that's where I was headed and he and I proceeded to walk together down the sidewalk towards the cafe. He asked me if I was in school or if I worked, I told him about my work and that I currently wasn't attending school. He then goes, \"You know you're a blessing to yourself and those around you. Don't ever forget that.\" I thanked him and told him how much I needed to hear that. I told him that I was trying to pursue comedy and music as well. He replies, \"Don't ever say try. Because trying sets yourself up to fail. Just do.\" \n\nHe asks me \"When are you going to see your mother?\" (My mom and I had already talked earlier this week about making plans to see each other soon). I told him \"Uhh I think this week or next.\" He said \"Good. Make sure when you see your mother, you thank her for making you the blessing that you are.\" We went inside together and spoke a little bit more. He told me he hoped to see me around again. I ordered my food, picked it up, and left the restaurant without seeing the man again. I went outside to my car and I noticed the parking space beside mine was now empty. So I'm pretty sure he was an angel in human form hahaha. \n\nAnd then a couple of months later I was walking back to my car after seeing a friends band play in downtown Raleigh, and I began having a bad existential anxiety attack. My car was a couple of blocks away and it was very cold, which didn't help at all with my paranoia haha. \n\nBut I saw a black guy dressed in all white long johns who looked about 30 or so. He was passing by me and he stopped me and was like \"hey man, I just got out of prison on a petty charge and I don't have anywhere to stay. Could you help me out?\" And I was like \"yeah man of course.\" And I gave him all $7 in cash I had in my wallet (which was all the money I had to my name at that current time).\n\nBut then after I gave it to him he looks at me and says \"You know, I could totally use this money to go get high or go get drunk but you gave it to me anyway. You have a good mind and a good heart and God is gonna bless you.\" \n\nI am not even kidding when I say that 2 days later I was cleaning out my car and I found a random paycheck from my old job that I don't even remember getting, for $750.

I was about to walk out the door, when I put on the song \"congratulations\" by Post Malone. Im not a huge fan of the song and I almost never listen to it, but it seemed to be fine so I kept it on. I got in my car, but kept my earbuds in (which I also never do because its kinda dangerous).  About midway to 3 quarters through the song, I had the strongest urge to switch on my car radio to the local hip hop station. This was not common for me either because I really hate that station. I took my earbuds out, and there the radio station was, playing the exact same song, at the exact spot I had left off from on my phone. This was kind of jolting at first because of how big of a coincidence it was, but then after about ten seconds of the song, it abruptly stopped and turned into static before switching to another song. That really freaked my out and I switched the station immediately.\n\nHonestly i dont know if it was a glitch, but it sure as hell was weird.",

I tried to open the toolbox with that key, and guess what - it opened the lock. Each lock has it's own unique key, so it must've been my key. \nWhat do you think? I have a no explanation for this.",

        "text": "I started perusing this sub about two months and enjoyed reading the perceived glitches in reality, and trying to see if I could discern between the imagined and the credible.  Then over Thanksgiving weekend one happened to me. \n\nI went into the basement and turned on the light by the washing machine.  I was immediately struck by both the intensity (brightness) and color quality of the light.  It was a pure white light that is indicative of an LED or more modern bulb.  Previously, the light was the classic incandescent, and gave off a mild amount of lumens and had the classic dingy yellow quality.  \n\nI realized someone must've changed the bulb.  I went upstairs and asked my mother and sister (who was at my house for Thanksgiving) who changed the bulb.  They both shrugged.  I don't think they were lying to me.  Neither couldn't reach it without something to step on, so it'd hard to believe they simply didn't remember doing it since I just used the old light a day ago.  I figure maybe their playing dumb for whatever reason.  My mother is clumsy and has a rep for breaking things accidentally.  Maybe she made a mistake, didn't want me busting her chops about it, so her and my sister conspired to change the bulb and stay quiet about it.  \n\nBut in the days since, I can't stand the intensity of the light.  Its just too bright.  So today I unscrew the bulb in order to examine it and see what new manner of bulb creation I need to avoid buying at the home depot.  When I look at it, its the same F***ING incandescent bulb that's been in the light.  I can see the worn stamp on the 'crown' of the bulb that happens with age.  You know, where it says \"Philips 60W...\".  I can see The dark matter that accumulates towards the base glass.  I even have a bulb from the same batch in another light fixture that I can compare not only the light to, but also the physical bulb to.  Its the same.    \n\nI'm mystified.  \n\nA bit about me, I'm not a drug user or big drinker.  I'm a pretty observant guy.  I usually let on that I know less than I do because I've found it can rub people the wrong way to notice too many details.  I don't have multiple instances of weird phenomenon that have happened to me that I can't explain.  Everyone has a few they can't fully explain, but this is the most air tight one that has ever happened to me that defies a logical explanation.  Unless an incandescent bulb can magically become notably brighter whiter somehow at the end of its life.  \n\nTL;DR - The light is drastically different, but the bulb looks the same and I really believe neither my mother nor sister changed it.

I try to call back but the phone robot lady says his cellphone is turned off. In a few seconds  he calls me with noises again and as I try to call back it's always turned off. By the time I didn't think anything strange was happening because of how rational and sceptic I usually am. I just didn't pay attention. I sent him an imessage saying I'm about to cancel the meeting because I got extremely lazy. Later we reliazed he's never got that message from me. He calls again and says he's at the place. So I go out and get into his car. We talk for a little and then his phone starts ringing. He looks at the screen and shows me, my name and number is on. He laughs \"It's you calling\" and I'm sitting right there with him with my phone blocked and switched into a sleep mode. As soon as he tried to answer it the call dropped. I checked my outcoming calls and there's nothing near this time. \nI don't know what happened that time but I still wonder what would it turn into if he had an opportunity to talk to THAT me on the phone.\n\nAnd another story, that happend to me when I was about 10. \n I was playing home alone when the landline phone rang. I thought it was my mom calling so I picked up the phone to hear an irritated old woman voice. She said she was waiting for me that long and how could I run away from home. I said I didn't know what she was talking about and that she probably got the wrong number, but that would NEVER stop her. She was in pure anger, she said she knows my voice as good as her five fingers , that I am so stupid to try fooling her and such a bad person in general. She really made me feel bad about me even though I never done thing she was saying. I should've hang up but I was trying to get her to believe she's wrong so passionately as if I woud be hypnotised. Remember, I was only 10 years old, and she got to hear it, as all the people who would call our home until I turned 15 would ask if any adults are home. Finally, she said she was going to call the police on me because she knows where I am. That's when I hang up on her full of fear. \nI don't know what that was, the phone wouldn't ring nor the police would come. She'd been  insulting me half an hour before I ended up the call. \n\n",

I'm not sure this counts as a glitch but it definitely weirds me out when I think about it. \n\nI had a piggy bank when I was younger, an orange ceramic one with purple and red spots. Loved the thing. I'd won it at a field trip my class went on in 4th grade, and I always kept it full of change. \n\nWell, fast forward a few years and I'm relaxing in an easy chair after dinner, turning over the piggy bank in my hands and listening to the coins inside it jingle. The light was really dim and I felt really sleepy. All the sudden, I just see a weird flash before my eyes and a picture in my head of it shattered into pieces on the floor. \n\nI remember getting up and putting it on a table. Then worrying about it getting knocked off and moving it to the other side of the table, away from the path where people walked in my house. \nI can't describe the feeling I had. I guess just worry that it was going to break? I felt really numb doing it. \n\nThe next day my mom picks me up from school and says that she's sorry, but my sister had knocked over my piggybank by accident getting her books off the table, and it had broken. Not just broken, shattered exactly like I had seen it. Even the color of our tile where it fell was correct. \n   I told her, swore to her, that I saw it happen the night before. That I had seen it before it actually happened. \n My mom's usually pretty receptive to these things so she believed me. To this day we still haven't figured out how I knew my piggy bank was going to break the day before it actually happened. ",

Scientists refer to this kind of phenomenon as deja Vu and their theory on why it happens is because our brain subconsciously gathers information and presents it to us in our dreams(or something like that). I don't think that's the case. For example, 3 weeks ago, I woke up from a dream and the latest thing I could remember was a black guy asking for a blowjob. Later that week while surfing YouTube for standup comedy, I found a clip of a comedian called Aries Spears. I only know about 4 comics that I avidly watch, but have never seen or heard of Aries Spears. That clip was exactly what happened in my dream and it kind of freaked me out, driving me to writing this all down in a notebook. I've spent hours over the internet and it seems that many others have experienced this, but there is no solid explanation. I've decided to write down the content s of my dreams in a notebook in order to track my \"deja Vu\".",

        "text": "Little bit of backstory here, I'm from California but I lived in Arizona until I was 9. We lived in a house on a small ranch in a more country-esque area.\n\nAnyways, I have quite a few memories from this place, but they're mostly incomplete and unclear. However, I quite vividly remember this elderly couple who lived across the street from where I live.\n\nI remember that we would go over there after school some days and would get cookies and milk.\n\nI remember running over there for shelter one night when my dad was having a bipolar episode.\n\nI remember that they took care of my dog when he ran away for a week to their house.\n\nBut most importantly, I remember one time they were teaching us how to paint using some special technique that escapes me. I remember painting a rather poorly-drawn cat, as cats were and still are my favorite animal.\n\nRecently, I came across these memories after visiting our Arizona friends for Thanksgiving. We were going to visit our old house for nostalgia's sake. I made a passing remark about how \"We should see if our friends from accross the street are still there.\" My mother, who was driving, remarked, \"I don't remember anyone across the street from us. In fact, I'm pretty sure ours was the only house on the street.\" To which I replied, \"No, I'm positive there was someone across the street.\" I then explained everything I remembered. My mom's only response was, \"No, I don't remember anything like that.\" My older sister affirmed what my mom had said, apparently she didn't remember them either. My dad quipped, \"Well, I guess you did have a pretty strong imagination after all.\"\n\nI kept quiet until we got to our old house. I expected to be proven right, that there would be a house across the street, and perhaps the elderly couple would be there, to. To my amazement, there was no house across the street. I shrugged it off, and decided it was just my young imagination.\n\nI came home yesterday and recently went rummaging through my stuff, hoping to find a small box I made of stuff from Arizona. I was a very sentimental kid, and leaving my first home was hard for whatever reason, so I kept some small items that reminded me of what I thought was my \"real home.\" I finally found it after searching for quite some time, and opened it. Lo and behold, there was the cat painting, in all it's horrifying glory. I just stood there, dumbstruck, for what felt like hours, but it was really just a few minutes.\n\nI brought the painting to my mom, and told her that it was the same one I remember making with our elderly friends. She just shrugged it off, telling me I probably made it in Art class sometime. Fun fact: I never went to any art class. When I mentioned this, she just said I must have made it in Sunday School at church. I'm basically 99% sure that never happened.\n\nI'm 17 now. I have not had a history of mental issues or hallucinations. So this has had me WTFing ever since it came up, because it's both nearly impossible that they existed and nearly impossible that they didn't.",

I call it a spy plane as when I mentioned to a couple of people it was all black with no markings that's was their reply.\n\nI was driving down the street and could see the plane a few hundred yards away. The back of my house was straight ahead but it was a couple of blocks to drive to the front of the building. It was in sight ahead as I turned left then I had a blocked view. I drove around to the right and approached my street to the right to go up. As I got so far I could see it again. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was coming to a stop in mid air in front of a tree. I drove on and up until I was outside my home and drove about the width of another 3cars where my road came to an end and there it was, hovering in mid air. Parked. I also know I didn’t act as the logical me as she would have got outa there but instead I just stared and stared and stared, looking in awe of its beauty. Trying to work out why and how it was there.\n......................................\n\nIt turned slowly in a very small space. It was as if it was turning on the ground and not in the air. I was caught totally by surprise and was taken aback by this. As I turned the bend into the final part of my street to park my car, I just caught a glimpse of a plane. It was about 25ft in size. There were two windows in front what I would call a split screen. I have looked on line and cannot see anything that I can say it is this one but the body was the shape of one I looked at on wiki. An E-3 but it was all the same size front to back. If that nose was off the E-3, so it was just a full rounded front, this is the nearest I can find. I was intrigued and went that one block further to the very end where it is a dead end of our street and seen it finish turning in no space at all at the side of our three storey block and it was almost as low as the top floor too. It turned slowly on a sixpence if you like. It looked impossible for such a size plane. My initial thought, it was a two man plane and nothing else was unusual other than its colour being black and where it was seen. I also think it was Matt Black. I did not notice any disc that the E-3 has on top but to be fair, I was looking up to it so I can't say it wasn't there but was really close and the angle I was at would maybe not have saw it even if it was there.\n",

Came across a New Years event picture in which I saw a photograph of me, wearing clothes I never owned. A photograph where I looked like I was about 9-10 years of age and not more. The resemblance was uncanny. The same smile, the exact same features. In that picture I was dancing, I've always loved dancing. I should say 'she' because that was sure as hell not me. The time I had visited this hotel before, I must have been about 14. I know for a fact that I never celebrated my New Years at that hotel and I confirmed that with my family too. Must've really been my doppelgänger. I freaked out and never got around to showing my parents that picture but it psyched me out completely. ",

We don't have a lot of room so we can basically hear each other in the living room, bathroom, bedroom and closet. These spaces are not far apart from each other. \nI was cooking breakfast in the kitchen, then went to the bathroom to stop the water that was filling up our bathtub. When I went back into the living room, my boyfriend had the most baffled expression on his face. He was staring at me, confused and surprised. I asked him what was going on, because I really had no idea. He said he had been practically screaming my name for 30 seconds straight. From when I was in the kitchen, to walking RIGHT past him into the bathroom, and back again. I did not hear him AT ALL. I don't have a hearing issue, and although I chalk some of that up to the water running in the bathtub being pretty loud, he was saying my name while I was in the living room, and when I walked right past him. He had that expression on his face when I came out of the bathroom because he genuinely thought something was wrong. He said I was acting like a zombie. We didn't have the TV, radio, computer or either of our phones playing any sort of noise. It was practically silent in the house besides the noise of running water. \nThis is SO WEIRD and I feel weird now. But also it was very interesting. Does this community consider this a glitch in the matrix experience? ",

Now about one and a half years ago, my across-the-street neighbors sold their house and a young couple moved in. They aren't super friendly and they aren't very wealthy. They mostly drove crap cars with broken exhaust and rarely clean up their yard cluttered with beer bottles and broken car parts. So i was a little bit confused when, after about 6 months, they drove home a brand new Audi Q7 (SUV). I initially thought that it was weird, but then I thought, \"good for them, that's a pretty nice car\". I really didn't think anything of it until a couple of weeks ago when my brother and I were on our street riding our bikes around. He asks me, \"Hey, what kind of SUV is that?\" pointing to the neighbor's yard. Without even looking I said, \"Its an Audi Q7\". He then replied with, \"no.. i'm pretty sure that its not, the logo looks like an \"A\" with a circle around it\". I told him that I was sure it was an Audi, with a bit of an annoyed tone. Then I look at the car, and was taken back for a second when Saw an Acura (that looks almost exactly like the Audi) in its place. I told him, \"oh, y-yeah that's an Acura\" still pretty confused as I was sure it had always been an Audi. At the time I had chalked it up to a friend visiting the house and that it was just a similar looking car. After a couple of days though, the Acura kept coming back and I didn't see the Audi. I told my brother that it was weird that they sold their Audi for an Acura, when he replied with, \"what? they've never had an Audi, that's too nice of a car\". I told him that I had seen it daily before he pointed the Acura out a couple days before, and he just looked at me like I was crazy. After a few more days I saw one of the neighbors from the house across the street taking out his trash and decided to ask him about why he sold his Audi, and the only response i got was, \"what? I couldn't afford and Audi\" and a weird look. I'm kinda creeped out by this. Especially because I am absolutely sure that the car in their driveway used to be an Audi, I remember it so well. Even the thoughts I had when they first got it. This seems like it has to be some kind of glitch.",

        "text": "today i woke up after going to sleep quite early and before going sleep i remember putting my laptop on charge as the battery was low. So whilst im having my morning coffee i realise my laptop wasnt fully charged but it was on 12% so i go on to check the plug and notice the switch wasnt not on so i thought i just must have forgot to click it on. But whilst i was getting my charger to put it on my laptop the battery percent jumps to 100%??   This could be a glitch or what?\n\nAnd i would also like to tell you about my glitch including a black cat, like the one from the movies. so i was on the bus back from school and i notice a black cat sitting on someones drive and a few seconds down that same road the i couldve sworn that the same cat was on another completely different drive???

I remember watching it on the news, it was everywhere. Magazines, Myspace, news, people wouldn't stop talking about it. Friends and family of his doing interviews talking about his numerous attempts, and it was so sad. \nEvery time I see his face I get this pang of sadness and then have to remind myself that he isn't dead, I'm just crazy? \n",

        "text": "A few weeks ago there was a post in /r/videos of the Chester Bennington tribute concert - specifically the part where the crowd sings over 'Numb'\n\nI watched it a lot of times, over the next few days.  A LOT.  I'd start watching different people in the crowd shots.  I formulated opinions about them based on their clothes, facial expressions, singing along or not, etc.\n\nLast night, after not thinking about the video or the people in it, I watched it again.  It's a totally different video, now.  There's bits and pieces of some of the people, but they aren't the same - some of them now have shorter screen time, others are longer.  Some remarkable people now don't show up at all - and their appearances had been A+ material - close-ups of the exact footage the cameramen were searching for - as needles in a haystack of Linkin Park fans and non-fans alike.  It's a totally different video.\n\nSo, is it possible that YouTube had the rough cut up when I was watching it, and it's now a polished version?  I guess.  That would explain it.  But what I'm really dying to know is if anyone else saw / sees the same thing.\n\n[Direct link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VoLHdADma8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=703).\n\nIf you're seeing what I'm seeing, let me know - comment or PM.  \n\nOh, and also, I'm not just crazy or imagining this.  I've never been so sure of something that's made me feel so uncertain in my life.",

I looked at my watch and its only 5 minute past the time i went out the door from my house. It's freaking weird since i had to cross 3 intersection, and an underpass without noticing. Did i just misread the time, and mindlessly and routinely wondered off to work? Anyway, i brushed it of, and have just been grateful that I am not late. Does this count as a glitch? ",

        "text": "when I was a kid, around 8 or 9 years old, my family was preparing for a trip to my grandparents house.  We were all having dinner and having a pleasant conversation when suddenly everyone was staring at me wide eyed and my dad said \"I hope you don't do that at your grandparents house\" I asked what and everyone at the table insisted I had just let out a really loud and nasty burp.  I am a quiet female and this is definitely not something I would normally do.  This is something I have never forgotten and it has always really baffled me. I'm sure to my family it just seemed like I was trying to cover up something rude but in my mind we literally went from having a nice conversation and being excited for our trip to everyone staring at me in disgust. \n\nstory 2: I was driving over to my friends house when I stopped at a red light and saw the person behind me was coming up too fast. I braced for impact and felt my car shake as I was rear ended.  adrenaline was pumping and I motioned for the car to follow me to a side street so we could exchange information.  the car didn't pull over and just drove away.  I was shocked as I believed I was involved in a hit and run. I looked at my car and there was not a scratch on it.  I told me friend and boyfriend and they inspected the car and looked at me like I was insane because there was absolutely no way I could have been rear ended based on the cars condition.  I am certain that I felt the impact and heard the crash. \n\nstory 3: when I was a kid our cat got lost for a week.  I spent the night at my friends house and as I closed my eyes I saw my cat's face flash in my mind. I felt a great sense of peace and I smiled and said \"Lego came home\". the next day, I went home and my sister excitedly said \"we have a surprise for you!\" and I cheerfully replied \"I already know, Lego came home!\" she looked utterly baffled and did not understand how I already knew",

It ended up in the trashcan after it bounced like a pebble on a lake 4 times. If I didnt actually see it - i would never have guessed the trashcan. I think this is Murphy's Law or maybe stuff dropped to the floor is it's own Glitch in the Matrix. On second thought, I think under Murphy's Law you can have other categories from A to Zed - including stuff Dropped to Floor. ",

        "text": "So last week a weird glitch happened. \n\nI initially had a quarrel with my girlfriend. It all started from one \"Hey we have to talk\" message from me. And from there the conversation began to heat up from accusations to anger. I remembered clearly that we exchanged messages such as \"你有什么问题\"(What's your problem) \"我不能理解你了\"(I really can't understand you anymore) and then ended with a \"we should just call this off\". We've been together for almost 2 years now and i remembered crying briefly and throwing the tissues away in the bin. \n\nThe next day when i checked my phone, the message \"Hey we have to talk\" wasn't even sent. Later in class i asked her about last night and she seemed to be puzzled as if nothing ever happened.... Bad dream? Or a second chance\n\n[The Message](https://imgur.com/a/NAL6c)",
