I love my department and my supervisor but I’ve recently had some major issues emerge with the faculty I was going to do a joint degree with. My department has been incredible through the whole process but I really no longer want to stay in this city or continue to pursue the joint degree here. \n\nMy supervisor is currently away so I’m not able to meet with her to discuss my options for another week or so. I know I can potentially complete the rest of my degree remotely and forgo the joint portion of the degree but I was wondering if anyone has been able to transfer universities part way through their degree? My supervisor also holds a position at another Canadian university that I’d be interested in transferring to.",

Urban planning is also an interest of mine. I also want to teach in colleges (my area you only need a masters and experience for a lot of positions).\n\nI am looking into Cal State San Marcos, but I can’t really decide which program fits best-I’m sort of leaning towards the MSW. But the MA in Sociological Practice looks promising too. I feel the MSW gives me more options, including able to provide therapy for people. \n\nCurrently, I’m volunteering with the text crisis hotline, and am seeking to volunteer at DV shelters and find volunteering for career counseling too. I’m in CA. \n\nI’d love to hear your experiences/thoughts!",

Vacation? What vacation! I can’t think about anything else than my thesis… \nI had to come up with ideas on the spot at work today. I’m usually an ideas person. I couldn’t think of anything!

I really need some insight on my upcoming graduate school decision as I am having a really hard time coming to a conclusion. \n\nI am an only child and grew up really close to my family. During my undergraduate degree rn, I am only 2.5 hours away and visit them at least once a month to catch up and pend time with them. My family is a big priority for me. \n\nNow that I am graduating, I am wanting to pursue a PhD program in Neuroscience/Biomedical Science. I am very very excited and so far have had 4 offers. The two main ones I am considering:\n\n**Option #1**\n\n* Same university as currently attending in undergraduate.\n* Close to family (2.5 hours).\n* Great program, with good research and facilities, but no particular PIs that stand out.\n* College town and kinda boring.\n\n**Option #2**\n\n* 1,000 miles away from hometown/family. It is about 6 hours of travel and one stop required.\n* Just as good program with multiple PIs I am interested in.\n* In an environment I have always wanted to live in as I love the outdoors and there is lots of things to do.\n* I have not visited but will very very soon, so that will be a huge contributing factor for me as well. \n\nTaking everything into account, it is putting me in a hard place, because I know moving programs will probably be best for me but I LOVE my parents dearly and can’t imagine being that away and it is making it a really big deal to me. They are very supportive of whatever decision I make but I can tell it is tearing them apart inside as well. They will be both retiring soon though which makes me semi hopeful that I can see them more often if I do move since there won’t be many chances for me to fly down during a PhD,\n\nFor context, I am self-sufficient outside of money and am confident in moving and living on my own. I believe no matter what I choose, I will make the best out of it. \n\nIf you have had to make the option move away or stay near your family that you love dearly, was your decision worth it?",

I really would like this opportunity to not go into debt after grad school and the faculty is very nice. I'm very tempted to accept this offer but I am concerned about two things: the courses at UMich is more theoretical based and less industrial-targeted and the competitiveness of the program. I would like to enter the work field after graduation so I'm not sure about my job prospects. I also know their cohorts are usually big and more competitive. Internships may also be difficult to obtain as I'll be working as GSI/GSRA.\n\nAnother school I've been admitted to is Master of Biostatistics program at Duke University. This program is more industry-oriented so I feel more confident about internship opportunities and job prospects, especially the program is under its School of Medicine. The drawback for me is that it is not very convenient to commute around Durham without a car and I would need to take out loans to cover the expenses.\n\nAny advice would be great, thank you!

In my undergrad, initially I had some major setbacks, i couldnt understand what profs were teaching, couldnt understand the ways to get marks... which consequently messed up my life and first half of undergrad. Later I was able to turn around and improved. Now I want to ask you guys, since I have 5 months or so, how do I get some basic knowledge about the courses that will be taught in first sem, or what tools I need to be okay with using for my PhD journey. I intend to learn them very rudimentarily so that I dont do the same mistake I did in my undergrad. Because if this time my grade fails, I wont be able to pursue phd as I will be going as GTA in a completely new country.  \nThanks in advance.",

        "text": " The first time I applied for PhD in the US, I got rejected by all 4 schools. It didn’t make sense. Here’s why I say so:  \n\n\nI had a First Class Degree and finished as the best graduating student in my department. I had 2 Masters’ Degrees, also graduating top in my classes. I had several academic awards. I had research works that I had presented at both local and international conferences.  \n\n\nI had 320/340 in GRE and 111/120 in TOEFL. I vividly remember that my application mentor’s response to the first draft of my statement of purpose was “Wow, Wow, Wow”. I refused to accept it was that great and sent it to 4 other persons who were PhD students/grads. Only 1 made minimal adjustments to its content. Others thought it was near perfect and only needed grammatical adjustments.  \n\n\nI had contacted advisors in all of the schools I applied to, except one where I was told it was not necessary. I had demonstrated leadership experience beyond school having founded, lead or being a part of different social impact projects.  \n\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when the rejections started rolling in. In fact, the first rejection I got was from the school that was supposed to be my safety net—my worse case scenario.  \n\n\nI remember a friend, also shocked, asked me “Toyin, What else did they want?”  \n\n\n3 years later, I had to choose between 5 PhD offers. 2 of the schools even increased their offers when they knew I was considering other places. I remember how surreal it felt getting on calls with would-be advisors to gently break the news that I would not be coming to their school.  \n\n\nI just want to say to someone struggling with rejection, that sometimes it’s really not you. It’s just not time yet. As you wait, I hope you find the fortitude to stay the course and not give up. Cheering you on! \n\nWritten by [Oluwatoyin Ajilore-Chukwuemeka•](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatoyinajilore?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAB-QLMQBEBp3nK9QGLCv579_A1xMBV47R8s)",

I have been a TA in math courses and also help my friends with math questions and really enjoy it. But the thing is I'm not perfect in math. Like I can do questions etc correctly \"by just yk following the method/formulas and using some concepts\" but I don't think I have strong understanding of \"why\" we do what we do. Which makes me think I'm horrible at math and shouldn't do MS in it. \n\nOn the other hand I have econ. Oh I forgot to mention I'm majoring in Economics and math. I love researching and would love to answer different questions/problems and maybe help others but again I'm not too good at econ either. For each course I understand stuff but forget everything once I move onto next semester. I would like to teach math more than teaching econ one day. But I'm afraid. What if I fail at teaching? \n\nI still dk if I should major in math or econ. I like math but what if I'm unable to do higher advanced math? Because I focus on the way we do math rather than why we do.\n\n\nAlso, I don't want to take a gap year/or join corporate world to think what I want to do. \n\n\nCould anyone please guide me? What should I do? I still have time to change my senior year project from econ to math. I don't want to regret ny decision later on. \n\nI'm extremely confused. Any guidance will be appreciated. Thank you. \n\nAlso, I have a gpa of around 3.7: 3.67ish in econ and 3.67ish math (cgpa in both econ and math are the same too. They don't help me decide either ;-;)",

        "text": "Hello!  Hope this does not come across as venting, I am looking for a solution honestly. :( I am a first year graduate student, I don't know if I am being overly dramatic, but it is really affecting my ability to do research, being in the lab and focusing, and naturally I need to talk to my PI. I really don't want come across as, like I said, dramatic but I am really running out of patience. \n\nI was assigned an undergrad research assistant to help with my research. Mostly for help with menial tasks and stuff (like labeling tubes and Excel work) We are both paid in our positions and they are insistent on getting the full 20 hours. They are rather nice person who is extremely enthusiastic to do research, but I honestly think they would do fantastic in another lab. \n\nSome key highlights:  \n\n\n* They do not understand fully about the research. That's okay, I am neither an expert,  and plant genetics is complicated, so I gave it to them in simple terms. But I feel like every time I am there, I am giving a lecture on plant genetics. But after consideration, I'm going to focus on my lab work and stop explaining the basics of plant anatomy and genetics.   My PI gave them some of the papers with the background, but it still really is not clicking with them. I asked them what their interests are, and it is actually pre-med, and they are only here for the \"research experience\".  \n\n* When I assign them tasks, like I asked them to populate an Excel spreadsheet with data, they are insistent on having me there watching them. I explain I am quite busy, even going as far as doing a couple to show them \"look it is really that easy\" but they are insistent on my supervision. I literally can do this by myself and get it done faster than it takes me to explain and babysit. Even labeling tubes, I literally cannot leave the room without them asking me every five minutes if \"this is right\" and they will get upset with how \"boring it is\" and sigh loudly.   \n\n* They really want to just be there when I am there and interrupts me constantly when I am quietly working on something or gets really upset when they find out I am there when I did not inform them I was going to be there. I really need time to sit down and think about the project and it is insanely hard when I get asked \"what are you thinking about?\" like I need silence to think, buddy. Or like I will be looking at the data and they ask me to explain my thought process. I have been coming in early so I could just get a moment of solitude I desperately need.\n\nSo, I am super puzzled on what to say to my PI. She would probably be super understanding, but they are hired through the university. Like I said, perhaps they would do better in a different lab and pose that as a solution.  Or if I am truly being a diva and should suck it up. I just don't want this to detriment me further plus the stress of being a first year, first semester grad.",

Wondering what to do as I look at working 20 hours/week unpaid and dig myself even deeper. Feels like I need to get a job, but I’m curious what you all have done. There’s no scholarships for therapists-in-training because this nation couldn’t give a fuck about us lol",

My fiancé won’t be able to move with me as the industry he works in is predominantly located in the area we currently live. Also, his job pays very well so we need that income. If we have children during my program, either I’ll have to take time off or I’ll be doing everything myself six hours away, in a city where I know no one.

It will also be hard to start my career with infants. \n\nI’m considering a career change, one that will allow me to focus on family a bit more. BTW my area of study requires a lot of time and research, it can be exhausting and stressful. \n\nHas anyone gone through this?

In particular my PI has expressed interest in developing a complicated in vivo model that I would very much rather not do, and I think he is disappointed that I have expressed limited interest in this experiment.\n\nGiven the differences in our outlooks for this project, how can I try to steer this project towards my goals and how can I effectively communicate this with my PI? What's the best way to convince him that letting me graduate early / on time is for the best? Thanks for any / all feedback!",

I have a great relationship with the department and two PIs who specialize in unique and interdisciplinary subfields of my broad field (Sociology) that I am interested in continuing research in. Specifically, I am interested in the intersection of criminology (substance use mostly, but also want to explore other areas of crim in the future) and spatial sociology (Geographic Information Systems/mapping mostly). I am also slightly interested in health disparities as well, but not as much as the other things I mentioned. I have found very few departments that have faculty that specialize in both of these areas, usually only one or the other. I do plan on applying to the few departments I found where there are faculty members in both areas, but I also will apply to my current program.\n\nIf I ended up staying in this current department, where I will receive my masters, and it is the same university where I got my bachelors (different degree program and department), how frowned upon would this be in the future? I'm mostly interested in staying in research. I'd prefer to stay in academia for the long-term, but I know that tenured positions are more competitive in every passing year, so I'm also open to working in applied fields as well. I just know I for sure want to continue in research to some capacity, hence the PhD.",

Dr. A insisted that i needed to take a specific proficiency test that Dr. B said was covered by a course I took in undergrad. The department grad studies advisor agreed with Dr. B. Then Dr. B was worried that I had not signed up for a different proficiency exam with Dr. A, who then said that she had not administered the exam for years, which Dr. A had not heard since she hasn’t had an advisee graduate in a few years. They have completely different views on course content and guest speakers, and it sometimes feels as though i have two divorced parents. there was one incident that made things worse between the two, where an advisee switched from Dr. B to Dr. A for valid reasons. i get along with both professors ok but whenever you mention the other their hair raises.\n\ni’m not usually on campus because i completed all of my coursework last year and because i started in fall 2020 when classes were mostly online so i’m just used to doing work at home. because Dr. A only taught online in 2020 and was on sabbatical in 2021 i’ve only talked to her in person three times, but a number of times over zoom since i was her research assistant during her sabbatical. i was finally on campus for a symposium and talked to her after the event, where she asked if i was graduating this semester, and if she had missed the email where i asked her to be on my committee. i told her that i didn’t realize that she expected to be on my committee, and that my advisor (Dr. B) had recommended keeping the panel as small as possible. \n\nshe seemed very hurt especially because i had came to work with her initially. i thought that the two didn’t serve on committees together. how do i make things better here? i want to talk to the chair directly and ask him to put an end to the pettiness but i know it’s a bad idea. this whole thing, along with unionizing has really soured me from academias.",

        "text": "(If this kind of post isn't allowed, I understand and will seek advice elsewhere. This is a grad school decision post, but I think it's a little more nuanced than Rule 12)\n\nI feel like I’m having a bit of a grad school decision crisis. I’m looking for some general advice and also just venting. This will almost surely be a really long post.\n\nI’m in an engineering field that requires an MS for most industry roles, but PhD’s aren’t uncommon. It’s debatable if the opportunity cost of a PhD is worth it, but either an MS or a PhD would probably be fine for industry. However, academia is an equally alluring path to me. I’ve had several academic mentors tell me that I’d be a good fit for academia in my field, and they see me going far in it should I want to. Granted, I’m not sure how true this is, but it’s encouraging to say the least, and these are people I do generally really trust.\n\nSo here are my two options that I’m having panic attacks over:\n\n**School A**: A PhD on the other side of the country with a faculty member that I can really only describe as a 100% match for my research interests. Based on our discussions, this faculty member would be an incredible mentor and I’d have considerable autonomy to study pretty much exactly what I want. It’s a dream PhD program in that sense. I could see myself using this as an excellent springboard for academia, and likely industry as well. \n\n**School B**: A MS program at a local school with a verbal understanding that I could continue on to a PhD if I want. It would be a strong advising network in an industry-relevant thesis, but it’s not really as good of a fit as the other program. (But not a bad fit either). My funding is more rigid in what exactly I work on as a thesis, but it has the flexibility to stop at a MS if I want to.\n\nComplicating matters more, I have a partner in a PhD program no where near School A. My partner understands and would respect any decision I make, but 5 years is just… a lot. It seems like School B might be a safer, risk-averse option due to the flexibility/proximity, but School A is honestly just a perfect PhD match, so I’m struggling a lot here. Being in engineering with the dichotomy between academia/industry is also tough. Any thoughts from anyone in a similar position would be welcome.",

I will write a nice thank you note tailored for each committee member, but I’m wondering if there is something else small I could include? I thought about personalized bookmarks. \n\nPersonally, I don’t think every dissertation committee needs to receive gifts, but in my specific situation, my committee has given me a LOT of their time. They’ve helped me publish several manuscripts, at least 10 conference presentations, and they’ve given me many hours of one-on-one mentorship. My committee chair has quite literally made her schedule around my defense, as I wrote my dissertation in 6 weeks. \n\nI’m a gift giver by nature and maybe that’s why I feel so compelled to give a small gift. Any thoughts or ideas?",
