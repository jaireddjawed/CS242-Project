        "text": "Once upon a time in the stone age, when my father was a wee little lad (or at least a young adult at the oldest), my grandfather was -- I think -- an engineer/architect of some kind over here in Aus. While I am not aware of most of his achievements, I am aware that he worked on Warragamba Dam, and also a certain mine somewhere.\n\nNow, let me tell you -- while he was working on this mine, shit was happening. Women were graduating uni at higher rates than ever, entering the workforce, and pounding on the glass ceiling while sending the men on top of it the stinkeye for denying them. At the time my grandfather worked on this mine, it was illegal for women to work in the mines. The *intention* of this law carried on from some British laws where women and children had been exploited for free/cheap labour, etc etc, but times were a-changin', and my grandfather could see which way the wind was blowing.\n\nSo when the miners (or rather, whoever was in charge of the miners, but I'm saying \"miners\" for simplicity's sake) told my grandfather to whip up some plans for an underground bathroom block, he went, \"Sure.\"\n\nHe came up with a pretty good design that was mirrored down the centre and had two entrances. That way, when the law inevitably changed (as my grandfather knew it would), all the mine had to do was build a wall in the centre and they had a male *and* female bathroom.\n\nHe brought it to the miners.\n\nThey rejected it. Problem? It was \"too big\" and therefore too expensive.\n\n\"But,\" my grandfather said, \"if you wall up the centre when the law changes, you'll have two bathrooms of a standard size -- \"\n\nNope. They wanted a single bathroom for men only.\n\nSo my grandfather sighed, probably bitched a lot to my grandmother about it at home (knowing him), and did what they asked.\n\nTwo years later they had to knock it down and build an entirely new bathroom block because the law changed to allow women to work in the mines and therefore all mines had to have a designated female bathroom space, costing them way more than they'd have paid if they'd stuck to my grandfather's design and just stuck a wall in the middle of it like he fucking told them to.",

I was IT manager at an ousourcing company,  We managed the IT department of a 500 employee French Company.  \n\nAlways stressed,  I had many arguements with my boss about decision making,  I was responsible of this account and he never let me make fast and important day to day decisions.   \n\nSome employees were fired and after a few days somebody anonymously wrote an email from a fake  hotmail account to everybody@company. com... it was a nasty email saying names about \"The CEO was stupid,  the operations manager was corrupt and some employees were sluts...etc\".  \n\nI arrived at 7:30 am,  long before most employees will arrive,  and the HR director  came in a hurry to my desk asking me to stop that email from everybody to read it!!.  \"Do whatever is needed to stop it.\"  \n It was easy for me to react and ask the server engineer to disconnect the network cable to isolate the email server,  we can manually delete such email from the inbox of all 500 employees and be back to service in 30 minutes,  right?  right??\n\n So I called my boss to inform the incident and let him know we quickly responded to avoid this nasty email to reach the inbox of every single employee... I was proud of my decision.  \n\nMy boss, instead,  yelled at me over the phone and asked why I dared to disconnect the server!!??   ,  that I know nothing and the more I tried to explain that we avoided a potential nasty situation,  and I had the HR director green light to take actions.  He yelled louder,  \"Connect the bloody cable!! immediately!!! \"... \n-\"okay\"- I said.  \n\n I instructed the engineer to plug-in the cable,  he obeyed in disbelief.   On the next hour the whole company was in chaos after reading the email.  \n\nThe CEO was so angry when called me and my boss to provide a full explanation on what happened.    That night we had a \"lessons learned\" meeting at the outsourcing headquarters,  I was relaxed and almost smiling,  my boss had the worst day ever, he didn't want to make eye contact during the meeting.   \n\n(edit: typos &amp; redaction)",

        "text": "Long time lurker, made a new account because my ol' colleagues know it. A bit long, TLDR near the end.\n\nYears ago, I was young and hired as a specialist for a drug manufacturing start up. The company ended up making drug controls and standards instead, which are used to calibrate and setup the instrumentation used to detect drugs. My role as a specialist was to troubleshoot, create Standard Operating Procedures, initiate/perform/complete studies, and do a full analysis on the manufacturing process. My actual role devolved into doing everything from start to finish; receiving the raw material, making pilots, bulking it up, packaging it, and testing the materials between each step to ensure it fell within specifications (I wrote) and shipping it out. \n\nIt was grueling work and I often ended up working 60-80 hour weeks, which my fiancé was not a fan of but it was my first job out of college job and I needed the experience. I put up with this for about 2 years before the start up got bought out by a larger company. Cooperate decided it was best to assimilate the start up but send in their management team to get the \"... [BIG PHARMA NAME] feel and quality.\" In comes new manager, let's call him \"NM\".\n\nIt has been a while so I'm paraphrasing most of it. \n\nNM: So, Livid. What do you do here?\n\nME: Well, I (proceed to list everything I do and how long my days typically are). We've been understaffed for a while and I could really use the help.\n\nNM: I see, you mentioned you wrote most of the SOP's for each product?\n\nME: Yes. I had to validate X,Y,Z and author the documents myself. \n\nNM: Ok. Well. We have our own people who can draft these and help refine them. Could you email [people] a list of all your document numbers?\n\nME: Ok\n\nNM: Oh and -\n\nNM proceeded to give me orders to follow their protocols and get caught up on their training emphasizing how they're sticklers for rules and regulation. We inform all our customers that due to the changes we will be a week behind schedule and most are understanding. After a week of training NM asks me to sign off on the changes they've made for every SOP. And they completely trashed the old SOP and misconstrued most of the contents of each document. I bring it up and get promptly told to file a grievance via NM. \n\nME: Did you see what they did to the SOP's?\n\nNM: They made them more efficient! There was too much technical language in the old drafts, we need anyone to be able to understand it. \n\nME: They removed the control charts and sample calculations.\n\nNM: Yes. They were deemed unnecessary.\n\nME: Our chemists need to do those to [fulfill government regulatory] \n\nNM: Please, Livid. You do your job and you let the engineers and our legal team handle [GOV'MENT]. \"I don't want to hear anything more about this, your file says you're a QC Analyst. *You can leave the real thinking to the smart guys in QA*.\" If you won't sign off on these we'll just ask someone else. \n\nThose words echo in my head to this day.\n\nNM proceeded to demote me to their entry level, QC Technician with the same rate of pay (to keep me around?). He wants me to follow orders? Fine. I'm almost at my 2 year mark, I'll just follow orders. To the letter.\n\nI proceed to do QC work on all the products exactly as they wrote in our shiny new SOP's and pretty much everything was failing. Or at least they would have known if they bothered to do math. They replaced most of the core staff because old staff refused to cut corners and all our procedures were changed to the vague drivel that passed for technical writing. The products became inconsistent with up to 48%CV (variation) in the final product. All of which would have been known about and subsequently failed if they didn't change my procedures. According to the new procedures, they mostly passed. Mostly. Procedures say it's good to release? You got it boss!\n\nI meticulously documented everything into their new computerized system with a GMP/GLP/GDP compliant audit trial in excruciating detail how, who, and why I did everything I did even going so far as to reference the exact document numbers and versions. Per SOP of course. I kept this up for 2 months, almost all the products were sent back from the OEM's after their own secondary QC testing. \n\nNM: Livid, I need you to stay late for the next couple weeks to figure out what's going on. \n\nME: I followed the SOP's, everything passes with flying colors. \n\nNM: Then why is everything failing?! \n\nME: I wouldn't know. (I hand him my letter of resignation)\n\nNM: You can't quit now! We need you here! Didn't you troubleshoot these things before? I thought you wrote those SOP's!\n\nME: You know I can't do that. I have to leave the thinking to the smart guys in QA. \n\nNM: But, we-\n\nME: By the way, HR's making me use all my PTO effective tomorrow since I had too many hours and they can't cash me out.\n\nI had another job lined up with a more reputable company.\n\nTLDR: \"Leave the thinking to the smart guys in QA.\" You got it boss. Troubleshoot this mess  yourself.\n\nEdit: Formatting and stuff.\n\nEdit 2: Apologies! I omitted the aftermath. I'll reiterate a response I posted to someone's question: \n\nThe site ended up on \"conditional\" (probation) status with the [Gov'ment] and nearly all their OEM's for the better part of 8 months. NM was culled for \"negligence and incompetent leadership\" along with nearly half their staff on site. Or so I've been told. ",

        "text": "A few years back I worked night shift doing inventory at a retail store. We had 2 managers that worked on a rotating schedule and those 2 would swap to day shift and we would get someone else in their place. Well things would get pretty hectic sometimes and the managers would get us to stay late, tgen come in late the next day to avoid overtime. Enter jerk manager, lets call him Dave. Dave comes in and is a complete jerk, he is on our butts constantly and makes us stay super late one morning. I do what Ive been told up to this point and come in 2 hours late because Dave kept me late the day before. Dave calls me into his office as soon as I clock in and demands to know why I am here so late and I explain it to him. He gets red faced and yells at me and makes it clear that he and he alone decides when I need to come in late. I stay super late at and come in one time the next night and the other manager (Bob) is there. Bob asked if I have any extra time and I explain the new rule to him. Bob says good, work as long as needed and come in on time until Dave says otherwise. The next week Dave has to explain to the regional manager, why someone got 6 hours overtime pay when we are not suppost to work overtime. Apparently he didn't have a good excuse and got a torn a new asshole and all of a sudden he was much nicer to lowly ol me.\n\nEdit: to clearify a few points because l'm a bad story teller. Dave was being a smart ass when he said he would decide about coming in late. Bob saying \"good, work as long as needed\"  was him using Dave's words aginst him. I took full advantage of Bobs \"work as long as needed\". \n\nTldr; boss said he would be the one to decide if I had too much overtime or not. I took full advantage of the opportunity. Boss never made the decision and got ripped a new asshole by the regional manager for my 6 hours of overtime pay.",

I said to the owner I would implement an inventory control program and do some extras around the shop as we are somewhat understaffed and over stocked on our inventory.  Being a small business and my experience this was an easy task that could net me a bit more money. Also note I have about 10 years experience in inventory control and a few certificates as well. Currently I'm under paid by about $3500 a year. It's okay because of the 8 hours a day I'm at work I'm only working about 3 or 3.5. \n\nFast forward to now. I remind my boss of the conversation we had a while ago the programs are up and running and I'm helping more in the shop. Now I'm doing various tasks for the full day. Inventory stock has decreased and our customers are still as happy as always. \n\nHe says that because I got a raise last year it's not a good time to ask for one so soon. So I mentioned to my direct supervisor the few conversations I had with owner and he agrees that because I'm still within the \"starting wage\" as posted on the application I should stop all the extras and go back to what we had negotiated when I started. \n\nIt's fine with me. I'll sit on my ass all day and paid to do nothing. \n\nTldr: asked for a raise in return I would do extra work. Started doing extra work. Didn't get a raise and promptly stopped the extra work. ",

        "text": "This story takes place many years ago while I was working as the Help Desk Manager/System Administrator for an online campus. Most of my job was doing support for the small office staff (~12 people at any given time) but I also did things like maintain our file/DNS/DHCP server, wireless, A/V support for the conference room, phones, etc. I also supervised a small help desk of students who would respond to help desk queries from online students and the occasional professor. \n\nI was also responsible for ordering any IT supplies we needed, including things from Staples like blank CDs, labels for Dymos, and what-have-you. Our account manager at Staples never put our individual names on packages when anyone from our office ordered anything - he just addressed them to the office and we'd pick up packages based on tracking emails we got or when we were expecting something. Even though we were a tiny office Staples would sometimes just drop packages off mere hours after we placed an order since we were in a decent-sized city and our account rep was a stand-up guy.\n\nWhile working for this online college, the director hired \"Greta\", the brand-new financial manager and my direct supervisor, after our last finaincial manager \"resigned\" after months of coming into work drunk or hungover. Greta was having difficulty coping with the responsibilities and pressures that came with her new position. She had worked as a junior financial specialist at a sister campus and had been promoted to senior financial specialist when she came to work for us. She was young and it was obvious that she just didn't have the experience yet for this new level. \n\nAs time went on, Greta became frustrated and was under a tremendous amount of anxiety because she just could not understand some of the finer aspects of her job and the central office was calling her out on her frequent mistakes. Meanwhile, the director came in to work later and left earlier so he could work from home because all of his time in the office was being spent with Greta and trying to get her trained up on things. He was a decent director, a little too hands-off, but he had a full plate of work as well and couldn't keep just dropping everything to spend hours with Greta going over the same Excel sheet they had gone over days earlier. \n\nThus, the rest of the office started bearing the brunt of Greta's frustration and anxiety. To be honest, we all felt really bad for her but her attitude was emotionally charged, negative, and defeatist. One of my coworkers, who was friends with a lot of people in the business offices on our sister campuses, lined up a junior financial specialist position for Greta closer to Greta's home. The central office OKed the move, and though it would be a demotion in title for Greta, the pay and benefits would be the same. The idea was that the other campus would be able to invest the time to train her to be a senior financial specialist and we would hire a new senior financial specialist who could get rid of the backlog of work and stay permanently. It was win-win-win, or so we all thought. Greta didn't want the \"demotion\" though. In the end, the effort that had been put into getting her a more appropriate job was wasted. The central office finally gave up, shrugged, and told our director to deal with it. \n\nIt was around this time, about six months into her job, that Greta decided that micromanaging me would make her feel better. If I went to the restroom I would need to let her know. If I went to the server room I would have to let her know. If the white noise generator we had in the office was too loud I was not allowed to adjust it. If I so much as needed a new mouse or CMOS battery I had to ask for her permission. Because she was constantly busy and stressed out she'd go for days without responding to my emails and stupid little things like a broken desk phone couldn't get replaced because Greta wasn't giving me the OK. I was an Army vet, used to working independently as the only IT person, and really didn't sweat the micromanaging. I was more amused than anything else. \n\nOne day I had ordered something like pens or something (with permission, of course) and Greta had ordered superglue. I got the package the same day, took my pens, and gave Greta her superglue. She took it from me and closed her office door. \n\nLater on I passed by her office while she was in the restroom and noticed that she had the glue next to a women's pump (shoe) on her desk. Being curious, I peeked in a little more and noticed that she had purchased superglue on the state's dime to fix her shoe. This was not a big deal but wasn't really allowed. Since Greta had been breathing down my neck and \"supervising\" me at a molecular level I felt it appropriate to email the director and asked him to let her know that it wasn't a great idea to spend state money on personal purchases, no matter how small. He, in turn, forwarded the email I had sent to him to Greta and told her not to do that again. Again, not a big deal: no one was going to lose their job over a $3.00 tube of superglue that was used for personal reasons and I freely admit I was being a ninny-boo-boo tattle-tale for really no good reason - I just thought this would be a little quick jab at her for being a neck-breather. \n\nBut Greta decided that my round-about way of chastising her was the last straw. She told the entire office, not just me, that she would open all packages from here on out and that we were not to handle them at all. \n\nOk. \n\nDid I mention that our Staples rep was a stand-up guy? It was because of him that I found out that I could order quite a few products individually wrapped, addressed, and shipped. I needed a new CMOS battery for a desktop in the office but figured I should get a few extras just in case. After getting approval from Greta for 10 CMOS batteries they all arrived individually wrapped and enclosed in those gray pastic envelopes that really have to be cut open because they are too tough to open by hand. I also found out I could get blank CDs individually as well, so after getting permisison, I ordered 100 blank CDs (we sent software via US mail to some online students who didn't have the bandwidth to download a required application for a specific class). All. Individualy. Wrapped. The Staples courier wasn't thrilled and our small mail/break room was filled with 99 CD-sized cardboard boxes (someone miscounted) for a few days until our cleaning person was able to take them to the recycling dumpster. A day later, Greta stopped approving my purchases so I emailed the director himself and, since he was busy with real, actual work, just told me to go ahead and order what I needed and that I didn't need to ask permission to order things anymore. \n\nI found out I could get those cheap, no-name black ink pens individually. Same with small stacks of Post-It notes, Sharpies, network patch cables, those little individually-wrapped screen wipes, Scotch tape, and mouse pads. The literal amount of plastic and cardboard that was flooding our office those few days was amazing. At one point we had to fill an empty office with boxes leftover from the canned air experiment (Staples was nice enough to break open a pack of 48 compressed airs and send them each individually wrapped in boxes the size of a small wastepaper basket). Since Staples was using their courier for this they weren't getting hammered with shipping charges, though the same-day deliveries were taking a day or two now that the Staples van was maxed out on space. \n\nA week or so after I had ordered the CMOS batteries I got a curt email stating that I could open packages once again. I responded, thanking her, and asked her if I could go use the bathroom. \n\nA few weeks later Greta left for another position and the office returned to normal. ",

It's a contract, so I'm third party to many, many things inside, this can be a blessing or a bane depending on circumstances, but more often than not, blessings floweth over.\n\nRecently the two portions of the company came to a conclusion that they each have different directions and feel as though the company should split into two. For the purpose of confusion, the two parts shall be called company A and company B.\n\nMy contract is bound to company A, but until the official and physical separation, i still support people from both companies. I always had a feeling that the split would end up causing 'us vs them' issues, and while for the most part it didn't, there was the occasional incident. Sadly this one time involved me.\n\ni get a request for some assistance to get some equipment out the door and over to one of our nearby sistersites. Need me some specific paperwork to get this done. This paperwork is provided by our floor admins. I say to myself 'sweet, I know of one' and make my way over to her desk.\n\nAs I arrive, I give my usual pleasantries and ask if they can provide me my necessary paperwork. The admin looks up at me and notices my badge. It's got my flashy 'company A' emblem on it. I had assumed she was offended by said flashy image, because she then tells me 'You're with company A. I can't help you with this. You need to ask an admin from your own company.'\n\nI'm a bit puzzled because I'd worked with numerous other admins from company B without any issue or argument. I assume she's just new and explain to her 'Well, no worries about companies. I'm IT and I support the entire building, regardless of whether they're company A or B!' and put on my best service smile.\n\nShe's unfazed and tells me I need to see another admin and not to return to her desk.\n\nI laugh in stiff disbelief and head to another admin on the same floor from company B and receive zero flak from them. I took a moment to explain what had happened and they were quite taken aback by the offending admins actions and attitude. I shrug it off and get my deed done and move on.\n\nFast forward about 2.5 weeks and I see a familiar name in my queue. It's the Team-B zealot. I snag the ticket faster than greased lightning from .308's barrel and trot my happy arse on down to her desk like a child skipping to the front gates of Disney World.\n\nI approach said admin and ask about her issues, listening intently and nodding on occasion. She finally finishes her tech complaint and I give one final, slow nod with my arms crossed and proceed to break her heart with a 'Well, I'd be happy to assist you and all, but, you're with company B and I'm with company A. So you'll need to contact your immediate supervisor and find out who is supposed to support you now. Sorry!' and disney-waltzed myself all the way back to my desk.\n\nHour or so later I get a call from one of our local white-glove execs with some questions. I explained the first interaction in reference to the needed paperwork and then explained why I took the stance I did about the IT support. he laughed and said he'd manage it and kindly requested that I assist his admin.\n\nI happily helped the admin who sat in a state sheepish silence the entire time. I ended our service request solutions with a very petty, crass and quite venomous 'If you ever need assistance again. Feel free to submit a request to your local company A IT team. We're happy to help any and everyone, regardless of company affiliation.'\n\nNever heard back a negative thing from her.\n\nGood. I don't have time for petty, bureaucratic red-tape and BS.",

        "text": "This is a pretty small compliance that happened in grade 12.\n\nTo set the scene I had a horrible math teacher for calculus and vectors. She was hated by every student in school. Math was my favourite course making it worse. She was a teacher that had a very narrow path that needed to be followed. Notes were needed to be taken exactly how she wanted them and the way to write answers to every question had a formula that needed to be followed. At the end of the year, she began giving pop quizzes to see if we did our homework. This was around the time that all other subjects had major projects but we had to spend an hour on math every day no exception.\n\nThe compliance came when I was in one of her classes. I had gotten out of taking notes because I said I can't focus and take notes. I was getting good grades so she let me. Math comes easy to me and I would not answer any questions she asked the class to let others answer because I didn't want to show off. In the class I'm talking about, I wasn't really paying attention but she called me out in front of the whole class, \"I would appreciate it if more people would participate especially those not taking notes.\" This wasn't the first time she said a line like this and it was starting to annoy me. So for the rest of the class, I answered every question she asked and solved problems before she got to the solution. She got tired of it and tried to call me out again, \"Do you want to teach the class HaroldBeMeName?\" I did what any person would and stopped being an ass. No, I'm joking. I got up and used her notes on the topic to teach it. Needless to say she stopped bothering me in classes.",

        "text": "EDIT: I cross posted this from the maliciouscompliance subreddit to the EMS subreddit because it was requested. It’s a story about a patient who basically made themselves wait 9 hours for no reason through malicious compliance. It has absolutely nothing to do with being a cool story. It was a crosspost because in the comments of the malicious compliant post I was asked to crosspost it. Really not the end of the world.\n\nI love my job, and I work in the EMS field. I love solving problems, and helping people who need help out. We take people who are genuinely sick to the hospital, but we also take people who are 'B.S.' to the hospital.\n\nSometimes on holidays, or right before the super bowl we get an influx of 'grandma hasn't been acting right' hoping to send grandma to the hospital right before their party.  Sometimes we take people who can drive themselves, or have family members who can drive the patient. 911 is definitely an over\\-abused system if you ask me. We end up 'dropping calls' on critical patients because we're on an assignment with a patient who doesn't need the hospital. While what happened during my call wasn't on a holiday or before a party, the example I gave previously was to highlight that 911 is an abused system sometimes. In my area I'd argue that there is an 7\\-3 rule. 7 of every 10 patients don't really need the ambulance, and 3 of them really do.\n\n**Definition 1 \\- Dropping calls**: When the EMS agency that should be responding doesn't answer a call, sometimes due to other assignments or due to limited staffing. Eventually an out of agency organization will handle the call, but sometimes up to 15\\-20 minutes after initially dispatched.\n\n**Definition 2 \\- Mutual Aid**: When an out of agency organization instead handles an assignment instead of the agency responsible for the region. Example \\- EMS Squad A, answers a call for 'chest pain' in EMS Squad B's town.\n\nSo the town I worked in only runs approximately 1800 calls a year, which is about 5 calls in a 24 hour period. So we're far from busy, and it works well for me since I'm a Pre\\-Med student.\n\nIt was a lovely Sunday evening, and we had no calls during the night that were dispatched. Finally at 11PM we get dispatched to a mutual aid assignment which is an abdominal pain in the neighboring town.\n\nSo we respond, and after 10 minutes or so we arrive on location. We get out, and grab our equipment. One of the police officers tells us that the patient is going to walk out, and that that she is a frequent flyer. Then they warn us that the family is 'a little messed up'.\n\n**Definition 3 \\- Frequent Flyer**: A patient who calls 911, and gets transported to the hospital regularly.\n\nThe patient starts power waddling from the front door to the ambulance. She bypasses my partner and I are is ignoring us. We're trying to make first contact and see what the problem is. She attempts to lift herself into the ambulance by grabbing the side rails at the side entrance to the ambulance. Instead of saying she can't, she enlists her grandchildren \\(?\\) to help her in. They attempt to help her by pushing on her ass, hoping to heave her in.\n\nNow during this time, my partner and I are trying to stop the family, and the patient because they're going to hurt the patient. If she can't get in that way, that is fine. We have the stretcher we can pull out and put you in through the rear. But for the next minute of this, they're ignoring us.\n\nSo finally they stop, and listen to us. We get her on the stretcher, and we start talking to her while putting her in the ambulance. She tells us she has abdominal pain, and while explaining her situation her husband cuts her off and says they're calling 911 not because of her abdominal pain but because she fell 2 days ago.\n\nCurious me, asked why did they not call 2 days ago if that is when she fell. The patient starts arguing with her husband about the reason why 911 was called, and we put the patient into the ambulance via stretcher. The cop mouths the words \"Good luck\" and closes the rear doors.\n\nSo I take the next minute and quickly assess the patient, and the situation now that we're able to talk without her husband interrupting. Once I'm done I make my recommendation of which hospital we should take the patient to.\n\n**Hospital A** was a former hospital, and now an emergency room. If you were to get admitted you'd be transferred right upstairs to hospital B, bypassing the ER. Hospital A is generally a dead ER, very few people are there. You get treated immediately. Hospital A is closest to our department's local. Approximately 5 minutes.\n\n**Hospital B** is a very large hospital, but is extremely busy. Many times the ER has filled beds. Hospital B is the farthest from our local. Approximately 15\\-20 minutes depending on traffic.\n\nThis call was sandwiched right in between two hospitals. We really could go either way. Hospital A is something like 3.8 miles away, and hospital B is something like 3.5 miles away.\n\n**I attempted to recommended that we transport to hospital A**, due to the lower volume of patients, and that having been in hospital B recently there was a large influx of patients and she might be forced to go to the waiting room. However during me trying to explain this, the patient rudely interrupted me and said \"NO! I ONLY GO TO 'HOSPITAL B' THAT IS WHERE MY FAMILY DOCTOR IS\".  In my head I thought 'Your family doctor isn't there at 11 PM at night in the ER... and even if he was at the hospital he probably wouldn't see you. He'd be dealing with the other family practice patients'. After being rudely interrupted I agreed and informed her that was fine. We'd take her to hospital of choice. My recommendation was an honest recommendation to the patient, but I've learned something in the time I've worked EMS... when someone cuts you off, they don't care what you have to say. So I figured why bother trying to repeat myself for her benefit.\n\n**Now our department protocols is to the patient to the closest appropriate hospital, and because where we were hospital B was the closest.** The argument to go to hospital A was valid, and wouldn't have been an issue. But I complied with the patient because it was following our protocol. If the call was in our town, hospital A would have been closer and the patient would not have had a choice.\n\nSo I continue to assess the patient on the 8 minute ride into the hospital. I noticed the patient's husband in following behind and I asked her why if her husband is following us, why didn't he just take her to the hospital himself. The patient informed me that if he would have taken her that she would have had to wait out in the waiting room and would not be seen right away. She called 911 so she could get an ER bed immediately.\n\nMy satanic side took over, and I didn't get angry or mean. I knew exactly what was going to happen. I laughed to myself and told her that wasn't how it worked, and the patient called me a liar. She said I should make sure she gets a bed because she called 911, and that is my job.\n\nBoy, was she wrong.\n\nWe arrived at the hospital, and she was taken into the ambulance entrance. The charge nurse asked what was wrong, I explained and it was straight to the waiting room.  \"BUT I CALLED 911 !!!!\" cried the Patient. The charge nurse cockily said \"and now you're going to the waiting room\".  \"BUT THAT MEANS I SHOULD GET A BED FIRST!! \" responded the angry patient. \"That isn't how it works\" said the charge nurse.\n\nShe was transferred to a wheelchair in the waiting room and registered at the front desk. She must have been so embarrassed to come by ambulance to get put in the waiting room. While I was registering her, the husband came to the desk multiple times and informed the register that she fell. They didn't care.\n\nIt was a **9 hour wait for non\\-emergent patients**, like ours. 5\\-6ish hours later we went back and I peaked into the waiting room and she was still there waiting.\n\n&gt;!TLDR: Don't call 911 because you think you'll get a bed in the ER immediately. Patients with B.S. complaints go to the waiting room. Those with emergent complaints get treated right away.!&lt;\n\n**EDIT**: Just some advice for this who call with real emergencies. If your loved ones can talk for themselves please let them. Most of the time they can tell us what the emergency is. If they cannot, then please step in and help. Part of our assessment is how the patient talks and responds to us.\n\n**EDIT x2**: Some people in the comments are asking how people pay for 911 emergencies. The simple answer is insurance, and department based billing systems.\n\nIn the state I live in, only licensed agencies can bill. Which means many small volunteer squads don't.  They get subsidizing from the township. Then you get split into 2 categories for the departments who bill. Those who 'soft bill' and those who 'hard bill'. Soft billing is when you bill an insurance company, and whatever they pay is accepted as payment in full and is usually limited to residents only. Hard billing is when you bill the insurance company, and then come after the patient for the remainder of the balance. My department hard bills because we're private. Many municipal based EMS agencies only soft\\-bill. We get no township assistance so the hard billing keeps us afloat.\n\n**EDIT x3:** I've deleted the second part of billing information I gave. I'm not a biller so it isn't fair for me to give information that people might try to base their decisions off of. This billing is limited to my experience with my departments. We generally charge about $1,000 per transport. We're a BLS \\(EMTs ONLY\\) ambulance. Ambulances that provide ALS services \\(Paramedics or nurses\\) generally charge more.",

(Happened about a year and a bit ago).\n\nSo here in the UK there's a tech store called PC World which as you can guess, mainly sells PC's, laptops, phones amongst most other tech items such as CCTV/speakers/washing machines etc. I had just travelled to Manchester and back from Newcastle (6hr round trip by car) to pick up a refurbished HP Spectre I got at a really good price. \n\nOn the way back we passed a PC World and I thought I might as well get a crappy £20ish case and a wireless mouse for it and popped in. I found a few basic crap ones which I was happy with but there was a HP leather satchel I saw that I fell in love with. I was going to university in October so I could do with a bag, but was a bit apprehensive that it would be super expensive. I couldn't find a price tag ANYWHERE and the hook it was on said it was £30 (for a different brand type case which definitely wasn't the HP one - I looked at all the other hooks but none were for HP stuff). I thought I'd ask a staff member and this is where things got spicy. \n\nSo I ask a guy about the case and he says to go to his till so he can scan and check it. As he goes to scan he realises there isn't even a bar code on this item just brand tags saying what it was etc. I said it was on the hook for £30 but obviously it will cost way more than that and he said he'd check with his boss. This is the exchange:\n\n\n(Staff Member SM): Hey 'bossesname' I need help here there isn't a barcode for this item and I haven't seen it before.\n\n(Boss Man BM): Put the serial number in the till.\n\nSM: There isn't one, can you come and have a look because I've not seen this bag before?\n\nBM: Jesus Christ 'staffmembersname' just run it through what it is priced at and code it as an add-on accessory\n\n\nStaff Member just smiled at me and says \"you said it was £30 right?\" and I'm kind of like \"yeahhh... but I know it's probably worth way more\" but he goes \"boss said run it through what it's priced at and you said it was on the £30 hook so...\"\n\nAnd that's my story on how I got a £100 HP satchel bag for £30 because his boss couldn't be arsed to come and walk 20ft!\n\nBag for those interested: http://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=W5T45AA&amp;opt=ABB&amp;sel=ACC",

        "text": "I used to plan events in this very small city in a province that's more or less stuck back in time. My name doesn't sound English and I always ran into difficulties with paper pushers who were not so subtle racists. After years of dealing with government permits and all kinds of bureaucrats, I learned that making friends with the higher ups made things run smoother.\n\nEnter racist lady (RL). RL was new to the government department I had to get food licenses from. I needed her to go over some documents and approve them so that they could send an inspector on site to ensure that my food vendors were complying with food regulations. This was always fairly straight forward. I submited the documents with the vendor's information and get an approval to set up a time for the inspector to make sure the food vendors set up properly.\n\nI set up a meeting with her to ensure I'm aware of any new policies they may be rolling out between me applying and my event. Back then, I had been made aware that there would be some changes to policy in between the time I submitted the forms and the time my event happened. I always submitted my government forms several months ahead to ensure nothing came back to me with changes last minute. Our province was still figuring out how to deal with mobile food vendors back then and things would change as the year went on.\n\nThis is why I had made friends with the department's director (DD) . DD was chill. He was a man in his 50s that was super excited that the province would finally get some festivals featuring international food. We had met at one of my prior events. As a matter of fact DD had given me the heads up about the changes and gave me a heads up about RL's attitude. He offered me his contact info and told me to let him know when my applications were submitted. \n\nAt my meeting with RL, I greet her warmly and tried to shake her hand but she dismissed it. I chalked it up to normal bureaucrat unpleasantness. She's this big middle aged woman with a get-me-the-manager air all around her. She scaned the documents with a face that's both confused and disgusted. She asks me why there weren't any local \"traditional\" food vendors on site. She offered that the festival would be better if you served traditional local foods. I explain that none applied this year. She continues to criticize the vendor selection for some time. She questions the feasibility of some of the foods. She even out right says that she thinks one particular vendor isn't going to be too popular because people around here do not like spicy food and I should give that spot to a \"local\". That's never mind the fact that everyone in my event is a local business owner.\n\nI get she's going to make this more difficult than it needs to be. A meeting that would have been less than 30 minutes turns into an hour and a half inquiry about the vendor selection process and other details that have nothing to do with her job.\n\nOn my way to the office, I fire an email to her and cc DD with a copy of all the documents \"just so that she has an electronic copy\". \n\nDD acknowledges the e-mail and says he's looking forward to this year's festival. RL doesnt reply.\n\nFast forward a few months. One of my vendors also runs another food festival and she calls me up. She asks me if RL asked me to submit a list of all the menus the vendors will be providing. My friend almost had to cancel her event because RL refused to send the inspector without the menu information.\n\nI email RL and DD and try to get more information. DD says there is no such policy. RL doesnt reply.\n\nI've been burnt by such surprises before and I know a pretty bureaucrat when I see one. I got the feeling that she was going to request menu information from my festival and make me rush to get that info just before the event. I prepared ahead of time and got all my information in order.\n\nAs luck may have it DD was at my friends food festival. We got to talking. I told him about what my friend had had gone through. He didn't seem surprised. He told me he'd look into things but if RL decided to pull something similar off, I'd have to let him know.\n\nFlash forward to two weeks prior to my event. I need approval for my food vendors by that Friday and it is Wednesday and I've heard nothing. I had emailed and called the week prior and RL told me twice that I'd have my approval by the end of the week. I choose not to wait and drove over to the office. When I get there, the front desk lady tells me that I have a package and that it was there since the Friday of the week before. I figure it is my approval and I'm glad that I wont have to deal with RL's bullshit. When the clerk hands me the package I know what's up. She hands me a paper envelope containing what must have been Stephen King book.\n\nRL had taken the trouble of printing the regulations for food vendors and put it in the package straight from the government website. You can find those regulations online and I was very well versed in them. This was a not so subtle insult.  She also added  a document with changes that needed to be submited before approval. The package also contained a notice that I must make the changes to the application by Friday.\n\nI'm fuming. I spent the rest of the day reading through the changes. By the end of it, none of the changes she added brought me into complying with regulations. Most were information requests about specific details of the vendor's set ups and food menus. I had all of that in my original application minus the menus.\n\nWell, I decide to comply in kind. I submit my new application on Friday at 4:00pm. This is 30 minutes prior to the work day ending. I call DD and explain what had happened and to ask him if he can make sure I have the approval by Tuesday morning.\n\nHe answers the phone we greet each other. Before I can even get a word in he goes: \"RL is trying to ruin your event isn't she?\". \n\nI go \"Yep\"\n\n\"I'm tired of her shit. I'll deal with this right now. Enjoy your long weekend and see you in a few weeks!\"\n\nI got an email from RL at around 7pm that night telling me to pick up the documents from their office on Tuesday morning. She wont be in as she's going on vacation for two weeks and to reffer any questions to her manager.\n\nTwo weeks later, I run into DD at my festival. He pulls me aside.\n\n\"I know what you did. You're a lucky one, you know? RL was flying out to Europe for two weeks when you called me. I caught her just as she was walking out. I made her stay late and get your approval done before she leaves. I'm pretty sure she missed her flight.\"\n\nEdit: TL;DR : Racist bureaucrat gives me last minute homework. I give her last minute homework and she ends up missing her flight.\n\n\n\n\n",

It wasn’t my dream job, but it paid the bills and the stories I got from it made up for the crap I had to deal with. \n\nThe company I worked for were contracted to be at different buildings and hospitals, so we weren’t employees of that location. The security director at the hospital I was at was a complete jerk. I heard so many stories about him yelling and screaming at officers. I was on night shift so I didn’t see him too often. I was there for a while and slowly made my way up to supervisor and felt I ran a pretty good crew. \n\nOne day someone made a mistake, lawsuits were threatened, the typical when people get upset. We had a meeting with everyone in security. The director chewed us apart, insulted our ability to do anything, and concluded with “I don’t pay you to think.” He emphasized we were just warm bodies to fill positions. He wanted us to run everything by him. Everything. After all, we were just contractors, not employees of the hospital. \n\nWell I was supervisor on the night shift. And I was apparently not being paid to think. I had to run everything by the security director. Whenever anything happened at night from that point on I would call the director.   Car alarm going off in the parking lot? I called the director to ask what to do. The security car wouldn’t start? I called the director to ask what to do. Had a crazy patient in the ER? I called the security director to ask what to do. False alarm went off? I called the security director to ask what to do. I woke him up in the middle of the night every night since I wasn’t being paid to think and had to run things by him. Things I used to always handle by myself resulted in me calling him in the middle of the night. \n\nHe changed his tune after many nights of interrupted sleep. He eventually dropped the rule that we had to run everything by him after he realized how much went on in the middle of the night that could easily be handled by the crew. \n\n",

Booper. \n\nMy role there was to conduct interviews, do some HR stuffs and a bit of admin support to those higher up. \n\nI had been working for them for 8 months, I had 4 months remaining on my contract. Most people in the office were on these rolling contracts, there were vague assurances they'd be renewed. \n\nThey were not renewed as the whole office was being outsourced. We were told we'd be made redundant within 2 months. \n\nOne of the annoying parts of the system we worked with was when booking a room for whatever, you received an email and the online portal would show a red block when you'd booked the room, so others knew they couldn't book it. But sometimes the red block wouldn't show up, it was just one of those things. \n\nWe were consistently told by our manager that the email wasn't enough, we had to wait for the red block to show too, despite the fact that the email was the important part as it auto-forwarded the email and notified the reception at a PWB building that they had to prep the room for a certain date and time. The red blocks were just so admins knew not to mess with that time slot. \n\nProbably 2 hours after being told I was being made redundant the manager decides to chew me out about 'not waiting for the red block on the admin portal' again. Despite the fact the meeting went ahead at the correct time due to the email (cannot stress this enough) being the important part. \n\nSo I'm stewing, I'm mad. \nI get another meeting to book in a few days later for about a month later. The hiring manager had told me they were free the whole day and it was an inhouse meeting so pick a time and their diaries would match (easy peasy). I pop it into a kinda random interview slot at the PWB building and the email pings through but the red block doesn't update... so I try a different room and a different room until I've booked every room in the office. The emails ping through but no red blocks show. So I try a different time, different rooms until I've booked every room for the whole day. I've got all the emails but not a single red block. \n\nI laugh and shrug, call the manager and the other client and give them a time for the interview. I go back to job hunting and moved job within about 2-3 weeks. \n\nAbout 1 week after moving I get a frantic phonecall from my manager. \n\nThe PWB reception on the day of the interview had realised everything was booked. Nobody could hotdesk, drop ins could not be accommodated and because I'd left, all my Admin stuff had been locked. The manager was being rang off the hook by a super mad reception. \n\n\"Why'd you book the whole thing out, they had the meeting at 9 am as per your email\" he shouted. \n\nI replied that as both parties had been free for the day and I had only received the email confirmations not the red block, that I had to keep trying until a red block might appear.\n\n\"But you know the email is confirmation\" he screamed\n\nI said I was very sorry but I didn't work there anymore and had been under instruction to not take emails as confirmation so couldn't help him. \n\nTLDR; manager was adamant Red Blocks were confirmation, not emails so I showed him how wrong he was.

See the policy was if an item didn't scan, and the customer offered a \"reasonable\" price, you were just to take their word and manually enter it as such.\n\nI'm sure my definition of reasonable didn't quite match the company's, but customers sure didn't mind.\n\nI encouraged low balls and was like \"YOU GET A DISCOUNT, AND YOU GET A DISCOUNT!\" It's crazy how many 99 cent deals were being offered my last few days.\n\nAnd the best part is when I quit without giving a two week notice, the assistant manager took time out of his busy day to let me know I could NEVER be re-hired because I didn't give proper notice. That's one bridge I gladly burnt down on my way to a real career.\n\n",

        "text": "Years ago I had a thankless labour / service job with a pretty unappreciative boss, got lots of stories. \n\nOne morning I roll into the office about 7:25, and get a dirty look from the boss as I head to the dispatcher's office to collect my day's work (supposed to be there for 7:15).  I'd actually been working until about 1:30 (c. 18 hour day) the night before, and was thinking that only being 10 minutes late wasn't bad.  When I got my stack of papers for the day, I let out one of those low groans, and said, \"you've gotta be s#'#'[ng me!\", it was going to be another long day.  Boss takes that as his chance to call me out in front of the rest of the office: \"Hey, if you're going to show up late and then complain about work, we don't need you around here, you're fired\". Dunno if he thought I would apologise for coming in late and ask to not be fired, but I knew that I could have a new, equally crappy job before the end of the day. So I called his bluff, and handed over my clipboard and walked away. He must have looked through my work for the day, and realised that he didn't have anyone that could do what I could do and with the labour market crunch, he just didn't have anybody. On my way out to my car, I stopped and started chatting with my buddy and the dispatcher, having a smoke.  Boss comes out and tells me to meet him in his office so we can discuss my attitude.  I said, I'm not going to your office, I just got fired, my buddy and the dispatch are shocked, buddy says: \"you know he pulled 18 hours yesterday, and 15 the day before that\", dispatch says: \"why did you fire him, we've got no one to do his run today!\".  Boss is taken a little aback and says: \"I didn't say you're fired, I said you're FiHired\", so here's your route for the day.  I say \"well, if I just got hired, we should talk about my starting wage\", and that's how I got a $2/hour raise.\n\nEdit\nAnyone complaining about it 'only being $2 /hour': starting pay was $9 /hour, plus $1 /hour bonus if you didn't skip a shift, didn't break anything etc, so $10 /hour as a swamper if you got your bonus.  Got bumped to $12 /hour ($11 + $1) when you started driving truck, and you could get more from there as you worked your way up, I think the top end was $16 or $17. So for me, as a young guy, getting bumped to $13 + $1 was a big increase.  Also, this was around 2003 - 2004, and minimum wage was like $6.00.",

        "text": "Some background: I wait tables in a corporate restaurant but the other day I spent a dinner shift hosting. I'm a bit older than the other hosts that were on that night and have been in the biz for a few years, so I was designated to deal with this party as soon as it was clear they were going to be difficult. \n\nSome important things so know about this restaurant: all of the tables are bolted to the ground so they can't be moved, our largest table seats 8, we don't accept reservations ever as a matter of policy, for groups less than 8 we require half the party be present to be seated to prevent groups from sending one person to hold a table for an hour, for groups larger than 8 that wish to share one server we require the entire party be present to prevent extras from filtering in when we don't have space for them, and half of the restaurant is only accessable via a set of 3 steps. \n\nWe do enough business any day of the week so the policies on large parties actually do make sense to prevent small parties and servers from getting screwed over by large parties. The policy is posted clearly in the waiting area. Of course, this day was no different so we were very nearly on a wait for small parties and already had a few large parties sat. \n\nThe story: A group of 3 walks in and immediately begins surveying the restaurant. They set their sights on their preferred seating area and approach the host stand. Impromptu Contact will be IC and I will be Me. \n\nIC: We have a room reserved for 20 for 6:30. We're with the [whatever] group.\n\nMe: I'm sorry Ma'am but we don't accept reservations. Our largest table seats 8, so we can sit the group in sets of 4, 6, or 8 as party members arrive and tables are available, or we can wait until your entire party is present and space is available to sit your party together. \n\nIC: No, Betty Crawford (name changed) made the reservation last week but she's out of town so I'm the contact. All of the managers are aware. \n\nMe: Ma'am, we don't accept reservations. We can accommodate your party... \n\nInterrupting me, IC: She rented a room for the [whatever] group. Just all your manager. \n\nI ask for her name and call for my manager over the radio, telling him IC with the [whatever] group is asking for him. He's just around the corner so she only waits about 3 second to see him. \n\nI continue seating people while they talk. After some convincing IC accepts that we haven't taken any reservation and the party will have to wait. They opt to all sit together in one section, so I inform her that could take an hour or so because seats for 20 would have to come available around the same time, since we can't hold tables when small groups are waiting. She's obviously annoyed, but agrees. \n\nVery luckily two large groups and several small groups in one area all left at once, leaving the perfect section open for a group of 20. It had only been about 10 minutes since IC was quoted an hour, and only 5 minutes past their \"reservation\" time. I set up the section as two 8 tops and a four top, with an extra four top on hand Incase any of the group members ended up being large enough to need extra space or an extra or two was added, to be nice and so they wouldn't get screwed by the seating policy.\n\nI approached IC. \n\nMe: IC, how many of your party members are ready? \n\nI'd already decided that I'd seat them if most of the group was there, but I knew we'd have to skip them if less than half had arrived because I would get into trouble if management noticed I'd made such a huge exception. \n\nIC: I don't know! We were supposed to have a room and eat at 6:30! I don't understand why we have to wait! You better have something ready for us right now! We made a reservation and you're making us follow this policy nobody told us about! I don't even know what's happening! You know what? We've been waiting longer than anyone here and this is ridiculous! I read your policy and it says you can give us tables if we don't sit together so do that! This is ridiculous! \n\nWell, you heard her folks! They want to sit NOW according to our policy! \n\nI tell her I can absolutely do that, thank her for her patience, and ask how many are there. There's 12. 12! \n\nI mark the second 8 and 4 tops each available and walk them to the downstairs dining area. I point out their two tables and they immediately jump at the other tables in the area. I remind them that those tables are for other guests and aren't available. They try to push tables together, but obviously that's not going to work. \n\nI feel bad for the one lady with a walker, because we would've sat them upstairs if someone had told us that a party members had a walker. I offered to give her a table upstairs immediately but IC refused to allow it. \n\nI got an earful from IC about not letting them have the other tables, but she wanted to be say immediately according to policy. \n\nThe 8 top and 4 top that were sat where the [whatever] group was going to put the rest of their party were much nicer.

        "text": "So I’ve been reading tons of malicious compliance lately and thought I’d share a story of my own. \n\nSo back in uni I was taking a summer gen ed class on city and regional planning. At the time I was a closeted pre everything trans lesbian. But even though I was in the closet I could never let anyone talk shit about LGBTQ people. My prof in this course was a reverend and repeatedly made tons of remarks that were just on the edge of being socially unacceptable. So for the majority of the class I just smile and nod. \n\nEventually the final project comes along. We’re asked to describe a local public space and the sanctioned and unsanctioned uses of the space. For example a sanctioned use of a fire hydrant is supplying water in the event of a fire. An unsanctioned use would be opening it on a hot day for kids to play in. \n\nI see an opportunity for petty revenge and making my prof wildly uncomfortable. \n\nIn my city there’s a large park that the LGBTQ Pride parade ends at. In my paper I go halfway to the page limit describing the park in detail as well as the sanctioned uses of the park. Festivals, street fairs, taking walks etc. For the last half of the paper I describe an unsanctioned use of the park, as I was instructed. \n\nSee the thing about this park is, when homosexuality was widely criminalized this park was a huge cruising spot. “What’s cruising” you ask? Well, cruising is when gay men go out and hang around public places that don’t get a lot of traffic late at night in order to find a guy to have sex with. It’s almost entirely fallen out of practice due to changing social attitudes. I go into excruciating detail including stories and quotes from people who had cruised the park. I wish I had been there to see his reaction when he read it. \n\nWhen I got it back the entire section about cruising was unmarked and I had gotten full marks with no comment. He wouldn’t look me in the eye though.",

Even though my job title is analyst (which means I shouldn't be touching anything other than Outlook and Excel), but the workload and deadline demands that I do pretty much all the work from beginning to end. \n\nSince this is a suburban hospital where everyone's got their fucking mortgage and stupid step children to support, the environment is pretty passive aggressive, and people are afraid to lose their job. So, the end result is pretty much everyone in my department horde their codes away from each other, as a job security measurement. \n\nA simple number request normally takes me 5 mins to complete, however, management is concerned that such hording behavior will leave the department vulnerable if anyone leaves. \n\nSo essentially, today's meeting, I was told NOT to write SQL codes anymore and have meetings with the job-security people and hand the work to them. \n\nKeep in mind that what takes me 5 mins to do will take these people few days to do. So essentially, I opened up this subreddit and thought to myself: \"less work? Perfect!\" So I will have more time to share how I am NOT doing my job.\n\n**UPDATE**: 10 mins after the new policy went into effect.\n\n\n\n**BOSS**: Can you please provide this by end of this week?\n\n**ME**: According to our new procedure, I need ample time to discuss this with the BI team.\n\n**UPDATE**: BI guy yelled at me yesterday, because I am reciting the new policy, I redirected the anger towards management, saying:\"well, this is the new policy, what do you want me to do. Revolution is just steps away.\n\n**UPDATE**: Workflow reduced by 40%, pushed several projects way further into next year. Have the new policy printed out for easy referral now.\n",

The living arrangement in the building I lived in was that two people shared one bathroom and a small hallway, but had separate bedrooms. I lived with a guy we'll call Adam. \n\nNow being a Christian private school, it comes as no surprise that they had several outdated and weird, but strict rules. For example, couple's dances were strictly forbidden, and boys and girls can't share a blanket or be alone behind closed doors. Thankfully there was no dress code. \n\nA rule that did make sense was the curfew, considering most of the pupils were between 15-17 years old (No curfew for 18+). The curfew meant that after 20.00 all pupils had to be in their dorms, after 22.00 they had to be in their own rooms, and after 23.00 there was to be silence.\n\nTo enforce the curfew a teacher was assigned as nightguard, in case of an emergency. They would usually roam campus for an hour or two after curfew to catch and punish people who were outside. Usually boys sneaking back from the girl's dorm, or pupils who had been to a party off campus. \nIn addition, there was a random night patrol, that would just come into your room and check that you were present, preferably in bed since they came after 22.00. \n\nNow me and Adam got along really well and are good friends to this day, and back then, we used to watch a lot of movies together on my laptop. We were both nightowls, so we kept each other company. \n\nOne night when we were watching a movie in my room, the random night patrol came, they reminded us of the rules, Adam went to his room, they left, and Adam came back and we continued watching. Not five minutes later, the night patrol came back and now they were properly annoyed. \"Go to your own rooms,\" they told us in harsh tones. \"It's past 22.00!\" So Adam left again, and I preteneded to turn off my laptop. \nOnce they had been gone for a minute or two, me and Adam hatched a plan to finish the movie. We put a chair in the small hallway between our rooms and the bathroom, put the laptop on the chair and sat in one room each watching the movie. \nOf course, the night patrol came back, and they were furious, and started whisper-screaming at us that we couldn't watch because we needed to be in our separate rooms and be silent. We pointed out that we were in separate rooms, and that silence was 30 minutes away, and that the movie would be over by then. That was the final straw for one of them, and he threatened Adam with promises of physical harm, the other patroller calmed him down a bit. So we went to bed for half an hour, and finished the movie uninterrupted.\n\nWe did report the guy's threats to his wife, who had taken a shine to us in a recreational activity she led on weekdays, and who is not to be trifled with. A few days later he approached Adam with an awkward apology and a small gift.",

Our previous carrier would simply notify that the limit has been reached, and add the extra charge to the company bill.\n\nThe new one, however, specifically requests an SMS with confirmation that I need more data. First time I receive the message, I confirm it without any hesitation. It usually amounts to an extra couple of Euro at the end of the month anyway.\n\nEnd of month my manager calls me in and informs me that we are explicitly prohibited from ordering any paid features  on the company phone, as they are taken directly from the department's budget. Explanation on why I needed it did not convince him in the slightest.\n\nSo now that I cannot use mobile data to join those conf calls, I started staying late in the office twice a week, and reporting it as overtime. As I would normally leave office earlier, I had to stay an hour before the call started, plus the hour of the call itself.\n\nBy the end of the rust month, I had 16 hours of overtime, which cost the same department more than 500 extra Euro.\n\nImmediately after signing the overtime sheet, my manager told me I am now allowed to order extra data if I needed to.",

        "text": "Hi all, first post here, so I hope it's relevant.\n\nI work at an international school somewhere in Asia. My school is huge, and basically has classes for students between the ages of 0-12. There is a preschool course, a primary school and after-hours cram lessons. All in all the school has about 400 students, mostly in the 2-8 age bracket. \n\nNow, I have my own regular class, as well as being in charge of the after hours cram school. Due to tight staffing, I am usually by myself teaching between 10 and 20 students. It can be tough work when lots of the badly behaved kids are together at the same time, but I manage. \n\nRecently however, the manager retired and was replaced by a younger, self-important woman I will call K. She is a stickler for the rules, even when they are not practical. Recently, a child was hurt in my classroom (two little boys were fighting over a wooden giraffe, one bopped the other on the head and gave him a small cut). Despite the mother of the child being completely understanding, the injury being incredibly minor and my otherwise perfect track record, she decided that the foreign teachers could not be 'trusted' alone in the classroom. They must always have a native assistant teacher present. While I didn't like not being trusted, the idea of have an assistant was great! Assistants basically just focus on the disruptive students so that the teacher doesn't need to stop the lesson, having my own assistant would remove a lot of the pressure from the difficult classes. The manager claimed that the rule would protect the teachers in the event that a student was injured, as there would be another adult present to witness whatever happened, but this didn't ring true to me. All our classrooms have cameras in them, so we were already protected from any legal troubles if there was an accidental injury. This manager, for whatever reason, did not trust me or the other foreign teacher, despite us both having worked for years with no incident.\n\nSo, the new system was in place. If I started my lesson while the assistant was not present, say, she was going to the bathroom, the manager would march to my classroom and berate me in front of the children. This was very annoying, and when I brought it up at the staff meeting, I was told to do what she said. I was the junior employee, I should listen and obey. So, if my assistant was late, I would wait outside the classroom, even if my class was loud and poorly behaved. K would run over and reprimand me for not controlling my students, and I would put up my hands and say: Two teachers per room! She would huff and go into the classroom with me until my assistant finally arrived.\n\nThen, one day... My assistant called in sick. Influenza. The school was understaffed as it was, I was used to running the classes by myself, but with the new rule in place... I arrived at 8am, as usual, to prepare for my class, and the manager ran over and told me to watch over the room where the students who arrive early eat their breakfast. This was usually the job of the assistants. I took one look in the room, and refused. Sorry, two teachers per room! My manager glared daggers at me, and went to watch the children herself while I went and prepared for my first lesson. 9am came, it was time to start my morning class, but there were no free assistants. So, I waited outside the classroom with my material. The children were getting restless inside. K was very busy and stressed trying to deal with the parents of a potential student, so when she saw me calmly waiting outside my classroom while the kids began to cause a ruckus, she blew her top. \n\nWhat are you doing? It's 9oclock! Your lesson should have started!  \n\nI put up my hands: Two teachers per room!\n\nShe was stuck, she couldn't join the class herself, and she couldn't ask me to teach by myself or she would break her own rule. She mumbled something angrily and opened the door to the classroom.\n\nDo it by yourself!  \n\nDid I forget that she had told me she made her rule with the approval of the principal? I ignored her instruction, pulled out my phone and called him directly. I told him my manager was asking me to teach a class of 20 students by myself, despite the two teacher rule that she herself had created. He told me to pass the phone to her. I heard shouting, she winced, and handed the phone back to me. The principal informed me that no such rule existed, and that I should continue to teach the classes by myself, as I had been doing for the last few years. \n\nThe look of humiliation and anger on her face was almost worth it! \n\nI hope you enjoyed my story!",

Anyway, new boss has been there a month, decides that overtime is no longer allowed, to \"save money\". Husband is pissed, because that overtime had slowly, but surely, been getting us out of debt. Well, last week, they call him on his day off, a main machine has gone down fairly early into the shift.\n\n\"Sorry, can't come in, I'm not allowed overtime anymore.\" Machine stays down all night. These machines produce a butt ton of product per hour.

        "text": "Context: I work in a public facing IT service role for an organisation in the UK.\n\nTL/DR at end\n\nStory: So a guy walks up to my desk, with a copy of Windows 10 that he had picked up from the shop floor, and wants to know if this is what he needed to install an operating system (OS) onto his computer, I confirm and then ask if he needs any help doing so. He replies asking for advise on a replacement Hard Drive (HDD) for his laptop, so I ask a few follow up questions such as what he stores on it, if he needs data transferred etc, and it turns out he only does basic emailing, facebook, skype etc and doesn't really store anything at all. So I suggest to him a Solid State Drive (SSD) as they are much faster than traditional HDDs, and as he doesn't really store anything. He asks to see prices and as soon as I show him he gasps and says that he can get a 1TB HDD for the price of the 240GB SSD that I showed him. I tried to explain that as he doesn't need much space he would benefit more from the increased speed than the increased space but he wasn't having any of it and accused me of trying to scam him and that he won't be tricked again into spending more money than he has to, a bit puzzled by his response I ask a few more questions about his situation leading us to the second part of the story.\n\nFollowing on from my questions he explains why he is replacing his HDD in the first place, apparently someone had called him and tricked him into giving them control of his computer and then charging him hundreds of ££ for 'fixing it' and now he's trying to clean it and get a fresh start. Realising now what his goal was I explained there is no need to replace the HDD and install a new copy of windows, all he needs to do to is a factory reset to get the fresh start he was after, and I offer to explain how to do it free of charge. However, now suspicious after he thought I tried to scam him earlier he is having none of it, insisting this is the only way he can get peace of mind. So I figure there is no convincing him at this point so I ask him if he needed anything else, he said he would take the HDD, Windows 10 and asked if he replaced the HDD himself if we would install the OS and the drivers for him, I consider again trying to convince him there is no need to spend all this money, but decide fuck it, this is what he wants, so I reply saying it'll be £60 for us to do it. So there and then he pays £230 for the service, HDD and the Windows 10 licence and says he'll be back in a couple of hours once he's replaced  the HDD. \n\nA couple of hours later he does indeed come back, and to my surprise (I typically have low expectations of my customers technical abilities as they wouldn't be here otherwise) he has swapped the HDD out and will leave the Laptop for us to do the rest. I ask if he wants his old HDD in an enclosure (a device that essentially turns an internal HDD into and external HDD), which he of course declines, instead asking that we destroy or recycle it...\n\nTL:DR - Guy comes to me because he got scammed over the phone and wants a fresh start on his laptop, I advised he just needed a factory reset which I could explain how to do free of charge, but instead he insisted on a new HDD, OS licence + the cost of us doing the work, and on top of that wants us to destroy his perfectly working old HDD. So I say ok, and charge him £230.",

I don't remember why the specific day I had to go so bad but my bladder just felt like it was going to explode. I sat down and held it for a good 5 words of the test but finally I shot my hand up and asked the teacher if I could go to the restroom. I can't remember what she said but us some snarky comment like I should have went earlier and I should have known that I had to go. I got really mad at her and I decided \"oh I'll show you\". So I looked her dead in the eye and I started peeing my pants while sitting in my chair. By the time I was done there was so much pee that my butt cheeks were wet even because it had pooled in the seat. It felt so defiant while it was happening...\n\nUnfortunately, as soon as I was finished I realized I just peed my pants in front of everyone of my friends. I sat still until the test finished and I told her that I peed my pants. I don't remember what happened after that but I remember crying in the principal's office afterwards but waiting for my parents to bring me new pants. To this day I still remember how smart I felt when I started peeing but I don't think I've ever had something change in my mind so quickly lol. ",

On this occasion I got home from work and immediately changed and walked over to jump in and enjoy the summer weather, since I don't get to use it very often. \n\nI was wearing basically some athletic compression underwear that usually goes under my running tights in winter; I was in a hurry and grabbed the first viable option from a pile in my closet. They are hardly revealing at all [\\(example\\)](https://www.amazon.com/Under-Armour-HeatGear-Compression-Shorts/dp/B0088IB9Y2?th=1), fairly long and look similar to swim jammers, aside from the logo around the waistband. Opaque material and kept the junk fairly low-profile. \n\nApparently one of my neighbors at the pool, a lady from a different building probably in her 50s, didn't find it appropriate and complained. I *wanted* to argue that basically any of the actual shorts I'd usually wear in the pool were even smaller, they just weren't technically underwear, so the entire premise was silly.. but I like to be a good neighbor and get along, so I happily complied. \n\n..by putting on the *tiniest* pair of mesh Soffe running shorts I had. These didn't even fit me properly and were comically small; ironically I mainly used them as underwear. I casually sauntered back out to the pool with a huge grin on my face, didn't make eye contact with the neighbor, and jumped right back in. After getting soaked they were basically clinging to me like a speedo with a tulle miniskirt, with minimal restraint of the naughty bits. Didn't hear another word from her, but I definitely caught her staring. (As to whether she was glaring in anger, 'mirin, or both, I couldn't say.) \n\n*Tl;dr - Neighbor lady didn't think me wearing underwear at the pool was appropriate; put on shorts that consisted of about 75% less fabric.

        "text": "Circa 1997. Me, a fresh-faced waiter for a popular Italian restaurant chain that was currently promoting their “Pronto” lunch campaign. The purpose of the initiative was entice local office workers with a 30 minute meal that could fit within their lunch break. \n\nDuring these Pronto lunches, both the kitchen and waitstaff moved at breakneck speeds. For about 2.5 hours of the day, every second counted. I was a decent enough server to manage my sections during Pronto with relative ease. One afternoon, my inherently calm demeanor and professional composure were tested. A fellow waiter missed his shift. I picked up his 4-table section that was next week to mine. My tables fill quickly. I notice the hostess pushing his 4 tables together to make one large one. A 12-top. In the industry, having one large table is far more appealing than 4 individuals. Most of the time. \n\nAt the head of the table, the hostess wheels in a “Larry” chair or chair-with-no-arms meant to accommodate our larger patrons. The guests (office ladies) took their seats. Last to the table was the occupant of my Larry chair. Now, there’s big, and then there’s “how did you get through the door??” big. A serious looking woman in her mid-40s, easily 450 lbs and walking more side-to-side than forward. With considerable effort, she took her seat with an audible grunt. She was Red-faced, but unashamed as this was not her first rodeo dining out while morbidly obese.\n\nUpon being seated, she immediately started organizing the ordering process and coworkers fell into line. You could tell she carried some weight at this company as all the other ladies seemed to take their leads from her. My other tables were in a good spot so I took their drink order. Waters and iced-teas all around. Easy enough. I Dropped off their drinks and asked them if they needed another minute to decide as most of them were still researching the menus. The head of the table made the call for them and announced the ordering was going down immediately. \n\nOf course, she started it off with the famous “Soup, salad and breadstick” lunch. The token meal for every customer feigning a healthy diet. Unlimited bowls of soup and salad drenched in Italian dressing paired with those favorite buttered/salted carb torpedoes. She let everyone know that she only eats soup and salad as part of her new dietary regimen. Their faces were those of people who were not hearing this for the first time.  After everyone’s order was given(mostly soup and salad meals), she asked me if the breadsticks could come out before everything else. I complied and grabbed a few baskets and dropped them off. I put in their order and went to tend to my other tables. \n\nThe whole time all i could hear was this large woman’s voice booming commandingly over one side of the restaurant pausing briefly for an occasional breadstick. After refilling some drinks and dropping of a few meals, I circled back to my 12-top with salads. I had been gone approximately 5-6 minutes. In that time, the boss lady had eaten 3 breadsticks. After the salads were delivered I was heading back to start on the soups until I heard, “Do you think we could get a few more breadsticks?” I pleasantly complied and went back to the kitchen. \n\nHere’s the thing about breadsticks. They’re not in infinite supply and they take some time to bake. I went back to their table and informed them it would be just a few minutes before I could get more breadsticks and that I would be bring their soups out beforehand to stay on schedule as per the Pronto lunch schedule. The ladies at the table were understanding save one disagreeable woman at the head. Hers was a face painted in disappointment and annoyance. \n\nI made another pass by my other tables and then went to load up trays of soup. I quickly ladled and delivered them in record time. I dropped off some bills and checked on the breadstick situation. Good news, they were done so I grabbed some baskets and headed out again. In the short duration I was gone, my friend at the 12-top had inhaled her soup fagioli and was upset that she didn’t have breadsticks to dip in it. I apologized and quickly and traded her the freshly-baked artery bombs for her soup bowl and went to get round 2 for her. Couldn’t help but notice her salad had gone all but untouched. \n\nI dropped off the soup and made the rounds in my section. No more than 5 minutes had passed and I was being waved down again by my increasingly favorite guest. 2 more breadsticks and another bowl of soup had been Houdini’d. I took her’s, and a few more patrons’ bowls back for refills. After serving this last round I knew I had to pay some attention to my other tables. In almost no time at all, I was being snapped at by 2 sausage-like fingers for more soup. At this point, I was almost neglectful of the rest of my section. I dropped off the 4th bowl of soup and made sure to tend to the other tables for a goodly amount of time before heading back. \n\nThe entire time i was away, I could hear her trying to get my attention while her fellow diners looked on apologetically. This woman was at least 6 breadsticks and 4 bowls of soup into this lunch before other diners at her table had even finished one. She was increasingly rude and impatient, but i rushed a fifth bowl out to her. After that, i made myself even more inaccessible. I continued to wait on my other tables while she grew louder and visibly agitated at my lack of attention. After about 8-10 minutes of me catching up with my tables I returned to her royal highness. \n\nDespite the efforts of her coworkers attempting to calm her, she laced into me. Told me I was slow and inattentive. Informed me that she deserved more attention than my other tables because she had brought in a large party. Being the stoic professional I was, I apologized and asked her if I could get her anything else. She wanted another bowl of soup fagioli. I rushed back to the kitchen and, to my horror, discovered there was none. I knew what awaited me and like a condemned man I slowly made my way back to her table with the news. \n\nShe was madder than I think anyone has ever been about being told a 6th bowl of soup my not be in their future. Once again, she went off and questioned my ability to wait tables and even my intellect. A bit more abrasively than before, i explained to her that i had waited on her personally more than any other table in the restaurant and that i did have other people to serve. At this, she lost it and angrily demanded to see the manager. \n\nNow, my manager had been fully aware of the situation at this table and stepped in. He walked up and asked if there was anything he could do. She demanded more soup and my termination. My soft-spoken, non-confrontational manager looked at her and said, “We can’t get you more soup because you ate it all and RonnieRaymond77 isn’t going anywhere.” He comp’d her meal and asked her to leave. I’ve never seen anyone’s face turn as red as Larry Chair Lady’s did that afternoon. A bright shade of maroon made with a pinch of rage and embarrassment with smattering of high blood pressure.",

        "text": "(Disclaimer: I generally think that artists get screwed over way too much and people don’t pay them enough for their work. But this artist dug his own grave.) \n\nBack when I worked at a small publishing company, the product director I worked under was dealing with a very demanding illustrator. The author of the book loved this man’s art and was thrilled when he agreed to do the illustrations, but the artist had never done illustrations for a book before, and had never had to create art to someone else’s expectations. He fought us every step of the way, did the bare minimum to tweak his art to meet our requirements, practically threw tantrums whenever he got feedback, and repeatedly missed deadlines. We would have dropped him entirely were it not for the fact that the art was a deal-breaker for the author, whose books usually sold well for us. Despite all the drama, we just decided to grin and bear with the illustrator’s bad attitude.\n\nIn the middle of all this negative back-and-forth between the illustrator and the publishing team, it came time for us to finalize the illustrator’s contract. He’d already gotten a generous advance and would get another check once the art was finished to our satisfaction, but now we needed to discuss the book's royalties. Our publishing house was pretty small and didn’t have amazing rates, but we usually offered around 5% for the first 10,000 copies, and the percentage increased a bit with each additional 10,000 copies sold. \n\nWhen it came time for the meeting to discuss terms, this artist came sweeping in all full of himself, and before the product director could offer the usual rate, he said, “Now listen. I don’t care what you normally pay your illustrators. I want 2% for the first million copies sold, and 3% for all copies sold over a million. Don’t try to low-ball me; those are my terms, and that’s all I’ll accept for my artwork.” \n\nThe product director leaned back in her chair, put her hand on her chin, and pretended to think about it. Then she said, “Well, [Artist], if that’s what will make you happy, and after all that you’ve done, I think we can make that work.”\n\nWe went over the rest of the contract, and I kept expecting the man to realize how low of a rate he had demanded, but he really seemed to think that his artwork was going to make this book an international bestseller, and that he was getting a great deal! To this day, I cannot comprehend why he had such insane expectations for that book’s sales, and I can’t imagine who he talked to that gave him the idea that 2% was a steal. He went over the contract three times before signing, repeatedly insisting that he get his requested rate, and he left the meeting seeming to think that he’d beaten us at our own game.\n\nThe book ended up topping out at around 30,000 copies. \n",

He figured that this was just a growing pain and once everything was established, he would get paid 40 hours a week and have much less tickets to resolve, looking at the overtime as a personal investment. \n\nWell as the project was nearing completion, he was told that they were cutting his hours in the final weeks and then would simply contract with him on an as needed basis rather than give him salaried hours. He was understandably pissed. \n\nSince he was already at the max of his \"hours\" for the week, he decided to leave when 5 workstations had just been setup, including my wife's. The users hadn't been provided their credentials to log in. She was always nice to him and saw him leaving when she stopped him to ask him her login credentials. He told her what had happened and because she was always nice to him, he gave her the login credentials and then left for the rest of the week, locking several users out of their workstations as an \"unintentional\" result.\n\nNot too long after, the copier/scanner went down and patient charts couldn't be scanned into the EMR for claims processing and work really started to pile up. It was down for several weeks. They ended up bring him back for the 40 hours per week as was initially negotiated. ",

        "text": "My son had been going to a private Christian school for years  until his 7th grade year.  He had a science teacher that really should not have been teaching science that year.  But it was a private school so there wasn't much I could do about it unless I changed his school.  \n\nHe had an assignment to do a research paper about something and he picked dinosaurs.  He spent hours on the computer looking up everything he could find.  He wrote a pretty great report.  He talked about how long ago they lived, how they ate, what they ate, what might have happened to them, how they became fossils and so on.  He created powerpoints and really did it up.  It was his first report for this teacher and he wanted to give a good impression.\n\nHe came home crying.  This was a kid who when he found out I had cancer, just looked at me and said we'll get through this when he was just 7. If a kid would call him a name it wouldn't phase him in the least. For him to be this upset something had to be really wrong.  The teacher had given him an 'F' because the bible says the earth is only 4,000 years old (or something like that) and if the bible didn't mention dinosaurs they couldn't have existed.  And in the future instead of going to fancy places like Scientific America he should open his bible.\n\nI felt really bad for him and started looking for new schools right away, but it was hard finding one in the area that would work for my schedule and for his. In the meantime of looking he ended up just not trying in \"science\". The class spent so much time on what the Bible said and never adventured out.  The teacher made it very clear that the only scientific truth was between those pages. \n\n7th grade is a magical time, it is the time that most people start sex ed.  This school was no different, and that \"science\" teacher was also tasked with sex education. As you can guess, he only preached abstinence as the ONLY form of birth control.  He talked about other contraceptives but told them that they were unreliable and if they used them they would get a disease or worse get pregnant.  The only way to avoid getting pregnant they would have to abstain from sex.\n\nMy son was kind of a smart ass (he gets that from me), so he asked him once that if he had sex with a man and used a condom could he avoid getting someone pregnant that way.  Of course he got sent to the principal's office.  So he played it off that he was curious about if it could keep someone from getting pregnant.  The principal sent him back to the teacher, but gave the teacher strict instructions to teach my son about the horror the bible foretold for being gay.\n\nWhen I heard this, I hit the roof.  BUT my son seemed unusually calm and he told me that he was fine.  The teacher after talking to him had given him an assignment to find scientific reasons why abstaining from sex is the only way to avoid both STDs and pregnancy. I told him he didn't have to do that and I would talk to the teacher.  But he told me he wanted to.  I said ok and went about continuing to look for a new school.\n\nThat next day I get called to the principal's office.  He, my son and the teacher were there for me.  The teacher is red faced and mad.  The principal looks upset too, but my son is just happy as can be.  The teacher explains that my son used the assignment to make a mockery of the Bible.  I asked him what he meant.  He says that he came back and said that scientifically it is proven that abstinence is not 100% because according to the bible, Mary never had sex but became pregnant.  So while abstinence can keep you from getting STDs it cannot guarantee you won't get pregnant.  When the teacher told him he couldn't use the Bible because the birth of Jesus was a miracle, he had brought up his dinosaur paper that the teacher had TOLD him to use the bible in the future (he even brought the paper with him).\n\nI was never more proud of him and he of course was given an F for the assignment and the principal said he would not be welcomed back if he couldn't stop causing a problem.  I asked the principal what he expected my son to do.  He was told to use the bible and when he did he got in trouble.  He had no answer other than to stammer that my son knew what the teacher wanted.  Luckily he was out of that school by the end of the 9 weeks, but for the time period I told him he didn't have to do anything in the class. \n",

I'll try not to use any weird acronyms and keep it simple.  \n\nThe stuff we sell tends to be very expensive.  Think of them as big computer towers that have lots of cards in them to handle network traffic for the organization.  These towers need power supplies, supervisors, line cards, and then optics to connect them to other devices in the network.  \n\nOften Cisco will have bundles.  So you get the chassis, a supervisor, three cards and 16 optics say, for a big reduced price.  If you want more you have to pay to add on but it's way cheaper to buy the bundle and add on then to do it a la carte.  \n\nSo that being said we have mister customer here.  He wants two fully populated chassis with dual supervisors and redundant power.  I tell him that's great and give him the info on the bundle.  Once I mention the included optics he cuts me off.  Went something like this.  \n\nC - Let me stop you right there.  We have plenty of optics.  I'm not paying for more we aren't going to use.  \nMe - Oh not to worry even with the optics it's...  &lt;cuts me off&gt;  \nC - Excuse me.  I don't need you trying to upsell me here.  Just give me what I'm asking for or I'll find another reseller who will.  \n\nOkay then.  Those line cards are stupidly expensive.  We're talking $25,000 list price a pop.  Let alone the supervisor and power supplies.  The list on the optics would have been $16,000 a-la-carte.  Even if they don't need the optics going the route he insisted cost them substantially more.  After their discounts I estimate it about $60,000.  But hey, he got exactly what he asked for.  ",

I'm the guy who publishes tenders and generally try to make sure we don't waste $20,000 on a hammer or $30,000 on a toilet seat or buy some absurd overkill equipment because a manager was dazzled by a seductive salesman or Lord of Thunder.\n\nI keep reminding our internal clients that specs are important when producing tender documents. I'll take care of all the legal mumbo jumbo \\(and trust me there is a shitload of it\\), all I ask in return is a **usable** minimum specs document because when the lowes*t true\\-to\\-your\\-nee*ds bid wins \\(not just the cheapest\\) the quality of your needs \\(aka your listed specs\\) are vital. If it's too vague you'll end up with some cheap crap and it it's too precise or high\\-end, you'll end up with unneeded overkill quality or a complaint because you're trying to single out a particular product \\(yeah, I know when the salesman handed you a specs sheet, you're not the subtle genius you think you are\\)\n\nWhen a minimum specs document isn't adequate I try to guide and help my clients and for the most part it sorta works but you get some people that just don't want to learn or generaly don't care. Most repeated offenses are being to vague and assuming the vendors will know that to bid, being too precise or flat out thinking companies will magically hand us the world on a plater. I don't know how many times I've heard \"*but they'll do this to accomodate us, we're big\"* . Surprise, we're not. We are are insignificant spec of dust on their monthly budget.\n\nOne particular malicious compliance was with a client that just didn't want to agree that his specs document was shit. It was a holy trinity of being too vague at times, clearly too precise at other times, asking for impossible things and not having a budget big enough for his need. Stuff like \"we need a 21.32\" screen... why ? because only one company made this exact size. But at the same time the all\\-in\\-one solution had to magically talk\\-to and convert data from 5 different systems that no way in hell are made to talk to one another \\(what do you mean my car can't communicate with my toaster\\). Since budget was short they also decided to use residential grade equipment even after we told them that no reseller would warranty residential equipment in a clearly high\\-abuse commercial use. There was also some highly questionable contractual clauses inserted here and there. Really a doozy of a specs document. I told him in no uncertain terms that we'd probably have problems within 48 hours on launching the tender. Doesn't matter, client knows best, I'm just the pencil pusher with a credit card.\n\nMalicious compliance time.... OK, let's use your document since you obviously know best and I'm just the idiot monkey. Let's publish it on the government tender portal for the world to see. \n\nDid I say 48 hours before problems ? Hell I meant 5 hours. Within the first day I have 3 vendors informing me that what we were asking for was impossible and within 3 days I had an official complaint lodged at the treasury council because of those weird legal clauses he added. What do you know.... the document was revised along the lines of some of the stuff I had  proposed.\n\nI sometimes still publish bad documents when the client doesn't want to hear anything but that one took the prize above them all.",

        "text": "Back when I was in high school, I used to buss/host at the local diner. It was great at first; chill owner, cool cooks, hot waitresses, got paid in cash every shift. A 16 year olds dream. \n\nAs time went on, I got better and better at what I was doing and was put on Friday nights, the busiest day of the week. I would work Mon-Wed nights and make about $100-$150 cash at the most, whereas Friday, I'd make close to that in three hours. As awesome as it was, it was insanely busy! The place itself wasn't that big, about 15 tables total, and every time around 6pm, the waiting line would be out the door. As you can imagine, being the only busser/host for this took a lot of hard work and was very stressful, especially when Tara (the bitchy head waitress) was breathing down your back. \n\nOne Friday, I came in at 4:45pm and not soon after did I have one sip of my pre-work coffee did people come flocking in for our $5 fish &amp; chips special. About 90% of our customer base was the elderly, so \"flocking in\" was more like slowly maneuvering their walkers at a more heightened pace. By 6pm, the whole place was looking like a Carry Grant convention and we were packed to the gills. I've never seen the place get that busy before. Tara, was having a bad night, and you can tell just by her stomping around and snarky, demeaning comments she'd shoot at me every 5min. If a table got up to leave and it wasn't clean in exactly thirty seconds, I'd get the old \"You're fucking slow\" or \"Speed it up; chop chop!\", as if I was a dog. \n\nWhile she was behind the counter scooping ice out of the machine to make drinks, she slammed the door down so hard that all the Tupperware containers full of cereal and a bunch of glasses on the top fell/ shattered all over the floor. It was loud and made a few people jump, hell, I'm surprised Old Man Joe didn't have flashbacks from Nam. Anyway, I went up to see the damage and was instantly met with \"You have to clean this right now!\" from Tara. I basically told her that there's a line out the door and no one will be able to clear the tables as quick as I can. I thought this was a rational, well though out reason, plus one of the dishwashers could have done it. Nope, I was wrong. \n\n\"I don't give a fuck! Clean this all up NOW! she said. It was loud, but not loud enough to disgust the people sitting down at the counter (though I'm sure some of them heard it). If I was in that position now, I would have quit on the spot and walked out faster than anything. Life is too short to have someone treat you like that, and neither I or you should stand around and be subjected to it. But being young and not wanting to lose out on the money I was making, I put on a fake smile, said yes, and began sweeping.....as slow as I possible could. I made sure of it too. By the time I swept up the last remaining glass/cereal, the line got shorter and shorter from people leaving from waiting too long. The best part about all of this was that most of the people who left were regulars that usually requested Tara as their server. In the end, I managed to clean up all the tables that were left way longer than they should have been. The other waitresses were pissed at Tara because they had to waste time cleaning up on their own end rather than focus on their tables. \n\nTowards the end of the night, I could tell Tara knew she made a stupid mistake by demanding the only busser/host in the restaurant to clean up a mess she made. Once someone realizes that their negative actions can cause them to lose money (in this case, a lot of tips) they tend to look back and not make the same mistake again. From that moment on to when I left for college, she never yelled/demanded anything from me ever again. ",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I’m sorry if I overexplain things, i just explain things like I would need them to be explained to me. Thanks! \n\nI work at an SEO company. The basis of SEO is that businesses want to appear on the first page of Google  for certain keywords to get more traffic. We (legally and totally authorized) build links and reputability for sites so that they can become more popular on google, and get more business. \n\nThis requires looking into a lot of different factors to find the best 6-9 month long strategy to get them the best quality business (internet users that find their site with buying products/services in mind rather than jut ‘looking’, industry competition, whether or not they want to rank nationally or locally, and many others) in the long run, rather than getting them immediate results like an ad would. \n\nThat being said, sometimes clients find it difficult to understand why we’ve chosen certain keywords, but once we explain our thinking, they typically understand and allow us to do our jobs. \n\nThen comes along this guy. Let’s call him Mark. I start this phone call the same way I start every phone call. We talk about his goals and what he’s encountered before with his online presence, etc. he’s a bit short with me in some answers, but I assume he’s just in a hurry and move on. \n\nthen we get to the part where we recommend the specific keywords we should build links for, in order to build his online dominance and authority. He owns a furniture store in CT, so we recommended ranking for some specific, local keywords with strong buyer intent (I.e. ‘metal bedroom set [city] ct’).  He refuses. \n\nI try to explain to him that yes, the keyword is specific, but it’s not about what’s popular. It’s about the quality of the back linking. He says there’s no way he will use those keywords. I asked him what was wrong, and why he didn’t want us to target these keywords. \n\nHe explained to me that he just simply didn’t like them. Out of ideas, I asked him what he would like to rank for. He informed me that he would like to focus on building links for ‘modern furniture nyc’ and ‘modern furniture’. Nationally. For his ONE small warehouse. In Connecticut. \n\nTo clarify, he wants anyone in the nation to search ‘modern furniture’ to find him on the front page. He wants to compete with Wayfair, IKEA, Target, and every other furniture business in the nation. And he expects us to get him there in 6 months. \n\nAt this point I have given up hope that he will ever listen to me, probably because I’m a girl, but I asked my Team Lead and she told me to keep trying to help him understand, because of the monthly amount he was spending for his SEO campaign. Which is $1200 by the way. \n\nSo, I explain our steps to getting the right keyword strategy over and over, but he won’t do it. He has sent me a long list of keywords he thinks we should use. He’s being kind of a jerk but I honestly feel sorry for the dude. \n\nFast forward a few days. We’ve sent the list he gave us to the Keyword research team to ask them if there’s any way we can fit the keywords he wants in, and still somehow do our job correctly. \n\nThey come back with a keyword strategy that’s a bit far fetched to include his requests, even offering to keep track of ‘modern furniture’ so that if in the future it becomes plausible, we can see what the best strategy would be to target it. \n\nI’m preparing to call him in 15 minutes or so and look at his yelp reviews to kill time, after seeing he’s deleted all google reviews that were less than 5 stars. I find out this way that he constantly rips people off. Bad. \n\nCancelling orders and keeping the cash, refusing to issue refunds after products are returned or come damaged, ignoring angry customers, lying about product quality, the whole lot. Makes me feel a little better about everything. \n\nSo then it’s time to call him. \n\nI present him these new keywords and he is furious. He gave me a list and wants me to go by it. I say that’s fine, I’ll tell the keyword research team to input the exact words he sent us and use them. \n\nI email him with a final warning, listing his keywords and stating that if we go forward with the keywords he wants, there is a good possibility that his campaign will have no success at all. He emails me back a very short email stating ‘move forward with keywords. start campaign on Friday.’ I complied. \n\nHe now spends a whopping $1200 monthly for damn near nothing. \n\nTL;DR: client refused the professional advice he pays us for, he now pays $1200 for services that will yield him little to no results. \n\nEdit: sorry for the lack of paragraphs!

        "text": "I posted [a few weeks ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/86ezps/i_tried_to_warn_you_long/) about some MC I served and figured I'd update on the fallout and a little side helping of more MC.\n\ntl;dr of the previous story: Jerk manager \"John\" didn't let me tell him important information at a meeting resulting in unnecessary cost and schedule delays.\n\nAfter my previous story, John peacocked around how he solved the emergency part issue like some overweight Tony Stark. He touted how he \"beat the system\" and made known that our systems are outdated and redundant. John was going to get to use his ~~idiotic~~ change management process (JCM) which he preened about like a proud mother.\n\nFor me, I now had some time to get myself organized and freshen up on company procedures. Since this company if awful about notifications on new procedures, it was no surprise to find several new documents in the database. After going through the parts directly applicable to my job, and having nothing better to do, I started poking into the other departments. Much to my amusement there was now a company-wide standard for change management (CCM).\n\nJCM is a cumbersome bureaucratic marvel conjured up in Hermes Conrad's wet dreams. About seven different stages requiring new forms and signatures for each with applicable backup. The end result resembling a dictionary where each page has the same information but in a different order. This could be a change for $1M or $1k. Same process. Same rain forest decimating amount of paper. CCM reduced it to three stages with one form for the whole process requiring fewer signatures. This is way better for my company and our contractors.\n\nSo I immediately brought this to the attention of my team, right? Of course not. I sat on this information for a month. Besides, now that our new systems were up and running, I had plenty of work to claim plausible deniability. As I came to learn during those four weeks, the emergency parts needed had a larger impact than initially thought. The contractor supplied parts did not meet our specs and would need to be modified before delivery. This resulted in an additional week delay. Typically, work can be redirected to reduce the impact, but the contractor has already exhausted all of their workarounds because of other construction issues. \n\nIf you are not familiar with union craft workers, you should know that if they don't have work for a week they'll switch companies for another project to keeps the paychecks coming. Since we were likely going to need to bench them for two weeks, we were at a high risk of losing our quality qualified crew. In order to prevent issues with qualifying new people and potential delays from rework, we paid ridiculous billing rates for several people to sit in the shade for eight days.\n\nThroughout all of this, I watched from the sidelines as John set up meeting after meeting to improve the contractor's schedule which of course comes at a higher cost to bring more craft in. The company does not want to increase our budget, so John is having to plead and prove why it is necessary so he can keep his promise to those requesting this project. I finally broke my silence at John's precious Monday Meeting^^^TM .\n\n&gt;Me: When are we going to start using CCM?\n\n&gt;John: What are you talking about? We use JCM.\n\n&gt;Me: You didn't know? There is a company standard process now.\n\n&gt;John: We've always used the local process and will continue to do so.\n\n&gt;Me: You should look it over [hand him a copy]. If you look at the highlighted section it states this is the only approved process and anything else is not to be used anymore.\n\nYou would have thought he was reading his child's death certificate by the look on his face. Suddenly his baby, JCM, was useless. It was as if he couldn't comprehend that the process could be so simple yet effective. He tried to hand the procedure back to me, but I just held my hand up and said, \"You keep it. There is some good info in there.\"",

        "text": "I just started a new job at a mental health counseling center as a therapist. I've been in the field for several years and am experienced with all of the most popular software for doing things like keeping track of therapy notes, billing purposes, and storing Electronic Medical Records. On top of that I only need minimal clinical supervision due to my experience. All of that means that my new hire training time has only taken about half as long as it normally does, since all I really needed to learn was the work flow of this new clinic.\n\nMy two \"bosses\" are the Clinic Director (CD) and the Office Manager (OM). They are the two in charge of the entire clinic, and neither is higher than the other. The CD manages all of the therapists and makes sure we are doing what we are supposed to such as keeping proper records and what not. The OM is in charge of everything else, including the scheduling software we use to manage client appointments. \n\nOM and myself had a conversation friday that went something like this.\n\nOM: Wow, so you got through the training process really quickly. CD neglected to tell me you already knew how to use all of our software.\n\nMe: Ya, i've been doing this for several years now. Until the next major change I can run through this stuff with my eyes closed.\n\nOM: CD didn't tell me that she was hiring an experienced counselor this time. I should be able to put you on the scheduler for next week if you're cool with that. You technically have one more week of training time.\n\nMe: Sure, I don't mind. No sense in wasting productive time.\n\nFast Forward to this morning. I walked into the office a little early so I could check my caseload and prepare everything. My CD walks up to me and we have this conversation.\n\nCD: I saw OM put you on the schedular friday. I took you off. You still have a weeks training left.\n\nMe: I finished the training though. I sent you both the same email.\n\nCD: I didn't read that. Besides, it doesn't matter. You still have a week left.\n\nMe: So you want to pay me to sit on my hands for a week because I have a week of training left that I already completed.\n\nCD: Yes. You have a week of training left.\n\nMe: Ok. You're the boss. Let me know if you need anything.\n\nAfter that she smiled, nodded, and walked away. So, for the next week I intend to browse reddit, watch youtube videos, and maybe read a book. All while being on the clock for it!\n\n**Edit 1:** At the behest of many comments, I have done a few things today. First, I sent a cover my ass type of email to both CD and OM that confirms I am to do nothing until the training period is over. Second, I emailed HR asking for any government and/or company policy regarding training rules. I will update farther as the situation unfolds, so to speak. \n\n**Update:** So, after some asking around yesterday and checking my emails this morning I have a few more answers. The handbook states (paraphrasing here) that training takes as long as it needs to so that the supervisor feels like the employee is competent. State guidelines dictate a minimum of 1 week of training on company policy regardless of experience level or competency shown. So, I've crossed the state minimum requirements. \n\nAs for CD and OM. Everyone here is adamant that they have the same level of authority, and each can make changes in systems such as the scheduler as a \"safety precaution\" in case one of them is gone. However, CD  has the final say on the clinical side, where as OM has the final say on pretty much everything else. Both have been at the facility for at least 5 years. My fellow therapists say that in general they work well together, with only occasional disagreements, but OM is a rule bender and CD is a rule follower. \n\nCD specifically responded to my email and said she wasn't ready for me to be done that fast, and always goes at least two weeks as a personal rule. She says she will consider making an exception, but finds it unlikely that she will do so. ",

I have delivered my notice and start at a new (better-paying!) job next week. This was way too much drama and emotional labour for a shitty retail job lol. Peace it! \n\nLTL FTP etc etc. Sorry for the buildup, it's just necessary for understanding. This is just the beginning of my malicious compliance hehe. \n\nI'm 2.5 months into my first retail job. I was hired as keyholder and I'm doing pretty well, considering I've never worked retail in my life. Both my manager and assistant manager like me and have started teaching me some of their responsibilities, which go a little bit beyond keyholder duties. I get along well with all the sales associates, which makes work actually fun! \n\nThe only issue is the other keyholder, who I'm naming Power Trip (PT). A couple of sales associates had mentioned to me that PT treats them differently when management is around, vs. when she's \"in charge\". I never really noticed this as I'm pretty new to the job and we rarely close with each other.\n\nAnyhow, when we close, sales associates are tasked with cleaning/organizing the store, while keyholders do end of day $ counting, deposits, and reports. This is important for later. I personally have no issue with helping associates clean so we can get out faster. And if I'm closing with managers, I help with closing out tills and deposits so it's not just on one person. \n\nSo, I've been closing with PT for the last four days. The first night I cleaned up the store (on my own) and when closing came around, I started on one register while she started the other. \n\nPT stops me quite abruptly. She informs me that she's counting money and says in a very condescending tone: \"You make sure the store is spotless, and when I need you to witness and sign paperwork I'll let you know.\"\n\nOk. I find other things to organize while she counts, We've both been trained to do the EXACT SAME THING. We could have been out in half the time if she had just let me do my job! \n\nThe next day, I ask her if she needs help closing the registers. She insists that she doesn't, and tells me to \"focus on cleaning\". So I do just that. And then I run out of things to do, so I lean against the counter and watch her count.\n\nDay 3: Same thing. I lean and watch.\n\nDay 4: For variation, I sit on the store benches and watch.\n\nI'm just going to keep doing this to see how much longer she lasts. It's a proven thing that people get flustered when they're being watched as they complete a task, so I'm really enjoying this. I get paid regardless, and I live a\n10 minute walk from the store, soooo no skin off my back! \n\nI'll keep y'all posted on whether or not she finally gets fed up with doing all the work on her own. \n\nEDITING TO ADD: Damn I never thought she could be stealing! I’m such an innocent cookie lol. I’m going to mention it to management and also just start counting tills whether she likes it or not. \n\nThank you all for your eye-opening comments!",

        "text": "So this one is a minimally malicious compliance, but could turn out to be much more soon.\n\nOne of our corporate policys is that there must be a minimum of two employees in the store, previous management has been pretty lax on that rule when it comes time to close shop, allowing the other person to go home early while the manager finishes closing up shop. \n\nAnother thing is that they are super stingy with hours (ever wonder why you can't get help sometimes? Stores are minimally staffed.) and when they say you should be out 30min after closing, they want you out.\n\nNew management takes over the store and starts enforcing these rules to cover his own ass (fair enough, always a wise idea).\n\nSo we have this one employee, Mr. Slow who is extremely slow in closing the store, I'm talking 30+ minutes extra every time he does it, and of course, despite me asking him not to schedule to until closing, he does. This puts me in a bad position because I have to be up early for my second job. As someone who needs 7+ hours of sleep, after more than a couple days of getting up at 5:30am and getting home at 10:30+pm,I am exhausted.\n\nThe compliance: The next time he scheduled me to close with Mr. Slow, I decided to comply and stay until he was done. The next day I get asked by my boss why we stayed 45min over our scheduled time. Why? Because you said I had to stay.\n\nGuess who I'm scheduled to close with every day this week? Sure, I'll take a few extra hours of pay this week. :)\n\nAs a bonus: The last time he did this to me, I was so exhausted, I made a lot of mistakes, which he had to deal with, have fun doing that again! What're you going to do, fire me? If I keep working this schedule, I probably will put in my two weeks. One of the two others in my role just put in his two weeks and the other has told me he'll probably be quitting soon too. Hah!",

        "text": "I previously had a boss that was adamant that I kept paper copies of all reports. Despite the fact that the company only mandated that we keep records on the computer, she insisted that we keep weekly files (about 20-30 sheets each). Well, we didn’t have dedicated offices, but of 6 managers we all shared 3 computers in 3 large offices. Because each office had its own purpose, as did each manager, we often had to file each other’s paperwork. (Something was left on the printer or desk, we all liked each other and didn’t have a problem helping each other out). Well, our boss had her own office that was just used for meetings, was very small, and no one, including her, used it unless a big boss showed up. When the building first opened, keeping these files wasn’t an issue. We had a small filing cabinet and for the first 6 months, it held everything. We did have an extreme lack of storage so I asked, when the cabinet got full, where I should put the old files. \n\nI was told all the places I suggested were not secure enough and to figure it out. \n\nWell, our offices were huge so I put them in boxes, in stacks, out of the way. No good for boss-lady. Tried in a corner in a server room. No good. I moved these boxes at least five times over the next two years when it hit me. We now had about 30 boxes as employee files, reports, invoices, and everything else stacked up. All the managers together knew what we had to do. We put about 50 storage boxes into her small office by the time it all went down. (To be fair, the blueprints showed it should have been a storage room). We did leave a path to get to her desk and enough room so that people could still meet. When we finally did have a head manager visit, he  instructed her to get rid of the files because it was a security hazard and what was she thinking keeping them all around. We got to spend two days listening to music and shredding papers. I have never seen someone so mad in my life and it was a nice reminder that it’s the little things. \n\nTLDR: My boss didn’t follow company procedures, inconvenienced her subordinates, so we left all the evidence in her tiny office until it was discovered by her boss.

Well, apparently the big boss didn't like this, so no phones at all unless we're on break. Even if we have 10 minutes in between calls.\n\nI guess I'd be fine with that, but I see supervisors working while on the phone, and I don't really think that's fair. So guess what I'm doing in between calls now? Instead of being on Reddit on my phone, I'm now on Reddit on the computer. They didn't say anything about that, ha!",
