Since then, I had some small contract positions which weren't even longer than 3 months. I am extremely depressed and I lack any sense of direction on where to go in life. I feel miserable and don't know how to explain to employers what I have been doing during that time. A typical day for me goes waking up at 8 am, applying to jobs and changing my resume adhering to job description for a couple of hours. After that, I usually try to distract my mind from the stress by watching youtube videos or playing videos.  I have had my resume changed my multiple people and I still feel like I don't know what I am doing in regards to that. My internships were trash and I barely learned anything from them. Should I just stop trying to be an engineering since it has been so late. I don't want any sugar-coating, just some real hard truths. This isn't supposed to be a pity party, but actual answers. I feel really lost and am on the verge of suicide with how long this has gone on for.",

        "text": "So I live in an apartment built in the 1960s. The structure from the outside looks pretty minimal - large slabs of concrete held up by supporting pillars found inside the building as well as running along the outer perimeter (kind of like a stack of books with gaps in-between). Balconies are not extensions - they are just formed by exposing the outside concrete - creating a rectangular-strip walkway with constant width (kind of like a picture frame when looking top-down), with the units forming the inside and the balconies consisting the frame.\n\nI live in Michigan, so snow and icy conditions with freezing and refreezing is common. In the past two days snow has been accumulating on the roof, and this is likely to affect my local environment due to my unit being on the 11th floor - 1 floor below the top.\n\nHere are my main concerns:\n\n1. I can notice some (probable non-structural) cracks on the **surface** of the balconies outside. They don't seem to run along a significant distance and just seem to be present on the surface. They have been filled in with some process. Is this just minor wear and tear that's been correctly maintained?\n2. There is mild discoloration on the balcony concrete outside. I am not sure if it is coated to be weatherproof. This is especially apparent along the extreme outer edge of the balcony - there are what appears to be water-stains.\n3. Clanging, creaking, and popping sounds have always been present. I understand that thermal expansion and contraction are bound to occur and are accounted for, however after yesterday's drop from around -4c (24.8f) to -20c (-4f), the noises have become much more sharper and startling. I am not sure if this is cause to worry.\n\nI have inspected the basement of the building as well as the adjacent, below-ground-level parking garage, I don't think I saw any visible signs of structural issues (i.e., cracks). I don't think I've heard of any issues occurring in the past 5 months I've been here, but I don't have access to any past incidents (Google search returns nothing).\n\nAfter reading about my specific case, does /r/AskEngineers think I should be worried and contact management?",

We’ve finished manufacturing but I wanted to get a sense of correct steps in assembly. Our flight model (FM) parts still need to be hard anodized, and we are practicing assembly using the engineering model (EM).\nMy first question I wanted to check with is do we need to clean and anodize our machined parts first, then proceed to press fitting? I searched and a topic that came up was the anodized surface produced flaking once deformation occurs if press fit was done secondary, and I suspect this may be an issue with cleanliness.\n\nMy second question is do payload providers such as NanoRacks purposefully break press fit fasteners during their rounds of testing? I don’t think this would be a reasonable possibility for qualification testing but please correct me if I am wrong here. If so we were advised to create a section on disassembly and document it in our procedures if that does happen and would like some general advice if you have worked on something similar.\n\nI appreciate any and all the advice!",

They are incredibly rude, and exist solely to profit off of other people's misery. \n\nI drive a 2013 F150 4 door with 4x4. I want to know, what are some things I can do to my truck to make the job of the operators as annoying as possible? I want to give them a taste of their own medicine. \n\nI have a few ideas. First, E-brake and 4 wheel drive both on this should keep any of the wheels from spinning while the engine is off. \n\nPark as close to the curb as I can. Park in between two legally parked cars, and turn my steering wheel to one side, and then use a steering wheel lock. \n\nNext, I think I should design some sort of retractable wheel locks / chocks that will make the wheels not move. This should ideally prevent any transmission damage if the drive wheels start spinning while the engine isnt running. Maybe like a wheel boot kind of design? I don't know. \n\nNot looking to commit any crimes, I just genuinely want to stick it to these pricks. I am fine with parking illegally to test it out.",

        "text": "I posted this on r/findapath, but figured it'd be good to post here too.\n\nEarly 20M here. Honestly the past 10ish years have been rough for me. Lost a parent in my early teens, family issues, been dealing with lotta health issues. I basically didn't go to high school and ended up just going to community college after my GED.\n\nEntering community college, I just wanted to feel \"normal\" and not feel left behind. I remember taking an anatomy class just because it fit my schedule, and everyone in that class was pre health. After that , I just picked nursing since everyone else in my life also suggested that it was a good idea too.\n\nI'm in a nursing program at a university now, but I honestly don't think I like nursing. I fairly certain I do like bio and chem, but I can't tell if it's just because I'm just good at the subjects now. Living with health issues so much has made me almost not wanna think about healthcare or science recently. I just wanna live my life and not worry about my health to the extent that I've had to the past years.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought I would go into engineering since I really liked tinkering and building stuff. After losing my parent, I was so depressed and in a haze that I just stopped going to school tbh. The thing also is that I don't even know if I still like doing those things. I used to really like learning more about computers and phones, installing random Linux distros, rooting my phone and flashing custom ROMs, building custom PCs, stuff like that. Nowadays, I don't seem to care that much about stuff like that. Now I just wanna use technology that is plug and play and not worry about it.\n\nI've thought about it a bit and I think it's also a matter of confidence. No one ever really showed me how to maintain a car, so I usually just take it to the dealership for regular maintenance. Recently, one of my headlights burned out. I managed to change the headlight myself after watching a couple videos and getting a little bit of help from a neighbor. I think I still really do enjoy doing stuff like that. Fixing things and the sort. I fixed one of my blinds/shutters recently and I was glad I did after. A big thing that stops me from doing more stuff like this is that I have chronic wrist/joint pain that gets exacerbated at times.\n\nIn regards to confidence, I don't feel confident in my math ability at all anymore. Ever since middle school, I've taken huge gaps in my math classes. I don't feel like I have an intuitive sense of all the math even though I've taken Calc 2. I don't even know how I would go about patching up all the holes in my understanding and foundation. Even if I went about this monumental change of major, I'm not even sure if it's something I actually want. Maybe the grass is always greener.\n\nI'm on break right now, focusing on my health (primarily physical, but mental too I suppose), but don't wanna be stuck in undergrad purgatory forever. I know this is a long ass post, but I guess I just want some advice.",

There is also a condenser that draws the water vapor out of the chamber. Ice sublimates at ~0.005 atm (0.073psi).\n\nThis makes me wonder, would a chest freezer with a vacuum pump attached (assuming an adequate seal was achieved at the freezer lip as well as the hose attachment point) work to sublimate the ice out of a frozen product?\n\nA more robust seal could be implemented to create a more airtight chest freezer, and my current hose attachment theory is to drill a hole through the chest freezer and epoxy the vacuum pump hose into the hole.\n\nWhat does Reddit think?",

        "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI'm a researcher developing next gen Cu-carbon wiring to push the boundaries in conductivity of wires. We have come up with a new wire material that is slightly faster than Cu at room temp (\\~5% when conducting 4 point probe measurement). But where it shines is at higher temperatures (150 C) where we are seeing at &gt;15% in conductivity relative to plain Cu.  \n\nWe need to measure the resistance at various AC frequencies and see if the AC resistance is different (100 Hz, 1kHz, 10 kHz).  What would be the best way to go about doing that as the Keithley 2410C (source-meter / multimeter) we used for our 4 point probe measurement, only collects the DC resistance (when utilizing the ohm sensing mode).  \n\n**TLDR; How do you collect the AC resistance (conductivity?) of Cu wire at various frequencies (100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz)?**\n\nThanks a ton in advance!",

We are also looking for a hub style output so that we can mount a platter to the face of the gearbox. Something like the CH090 from candy controls looks like it will work, however, we are also looking for something that is ideally available off the shelf. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any gearbox recommendations or suggestions on where to look!

Or should I wait until after the gap, and take Calc 3 and Physics 2 so that I can apply them easier when I start taking engineering classes again?",

        "text": "Over the past few months, I have gradually come to realize that the engineering profession will almost certainly look significantly different in 5 years than what people currently anticipate due to the recent rapid development of AI. Whether or not AI takes over the majority of work is a different can of worms, but after messing around with ChatGPT as one example, I have realized just how easy it is to either automate complex tasks or learn complicated concepts in less than an hour now — things that formerly took days, if not months, of effort.\n\nJust with this technology, which I have only started to dive into since late December, I see many new avenues to streamline, automate, and all-out revolutionize my line of work as an analysis engineer including the following areas:\n\nReport writing\n\nData processing\n\nScript generation\n\nInformation transfer between departments (like PLM)\n\nThe unfinished list continues to bolster itself seemingly every day at this point as I discover ways that ChatGPT is capable of helping, not to mention other current and future AI developments. As more people start adopting whatever changes the near future of AI will enable in their day-to-day work style, I can foresee a massive adjustment across all industries. It may not lead to a sink-or-swim phenomenon like other major advancements, but I believe that this may provide engineers who adopt it the best and adopt it early will be much more competitive.\n\nAll in all, I have no doubt that AI will soon be generating new, more efficient work methods as well as fixing the inefficiencies that engineers experience on a daily basis. While neither my coworkers nor I have started to actually incorporate today’s technologies into our work, I hope to soon be using AI to save time on mundane tasks. Have you started to change your work style yet based on AI, and what are under-the-radar changes that you predict may soon happen?",

        "text": "**Hey Everyone! I am trying to develop a very high current battery pack. My cells are capable of delivering 20A continuously\\[cylindrical 18650\\]. the configuration of the pack is 20p42s\\[divided into modules\\]. The thickest busbars that i'm able to find can only conduct 5-10A of current in the series path. Over sizing the pack is not an option since weight is crucial here. can someone give me some solution for this or lead me to links that focus on battery pack manufacturing process for high current discharge. There are a lot of links for low current but that's not what I'm looking for. \\[i cant use press-fit spring type busbar since it is not vibration resistant\\]**",
