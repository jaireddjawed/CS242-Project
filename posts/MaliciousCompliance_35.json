        "text": "I'm a developper working in software maintenance. One thing my company asks of developpers is to make a daily log of our work time. For example, if I spent the day working on fixing a bug in Application A, I'd log one day on the Application A task.\n\nTo make things simpler, I took the habit to split my work by days. For example, if, for whatever reason, I worked on two tasks for half a day each, and knew I was going to do the same the next day, I'd log a full day on the first task, and the next day a full day on the second task. Our times are only used to check if we are in accordance with how many days of work we sold to the customer, so as long as the duration is correct, it doesn't matter how it's organized.\n\nMy manager didn't like it though, and asked me to make \"more accurate reports\" (despite the fact that I was one of the few that bothered to make the reports at all, but whatever). Okay, then.\n\nThe thing is, there was one thing that bothered me a lot with this manager : meetings. She had set up one hour long meetings every morning in which we would make a quick summary of what we worked on the previous day. I hated it. I'd much rather work on fixing an issue, than talk about it. Also, my work doesn't get done in one day ; when I get a new issue to look into, I have to check if I'm indeed the one that has to work on it, then reproduce it, fix it, and then thoroughly test it. So losing an hour every morning just to say \"same as yesterday\" really got on my nerves.\n\nBut with that new directive, I saw an opportunity to maliciously comply. See, I have the ability to create tasks in the logging system we use. So I created a task \"Meetings\" and another \"Meeting preparation\". The meetings start 30 minutes after the start of the work day. No way I can get anything done in 30 minutes, so that's meeting preparation. Then there's the meeting itself. And the logging system only works in increments of 30 minutes, so I'd round up. Meeting lasted 1 hour 02 minutes? Yup, I'm logging an hour and a half, in addition the the preparation. Suddenly my time reports are much less readable, and it seems we're getting much less work done on actually important stuff (some of my colleagues followed my lead)\n\nI kept that up for a week. Then I was informed that I no longer needed to make accurate time logs, and the meetings have been split into separate weekly meetings for each team.\n\nTL;DR : manager wants me to be \"more accurate\" when logging my work time for the day. It take it as an opportunity to point out what a waste of time her daily meetings are.",

        "text": "The trite wisdom is that in law school \"1L year they scare you to death, 2L year they work you to death, and 3L year they bore you to death.\" Not so for me. 1L year I was scared as hell and 2L year I worked my ass off, but I also worked my ass off 3L year, thanks to my role as President of a large student club.\n\nI ran for the the position of President with lofty goals in mind. I was friends with the Assistant Dean who was the adviser to the club, having worked with her for the last year when I was on the board. All my big plans were dashed to pieces when she stepped down and the law school incarnation of Dolores Umbridge replaced her.\n\nThe outgoing Assistant Dean would come to student competitions to watch, would interact and fight on behalf of students. She was a queen. Her replacement, Ms. Umbridge, was a busy mid-level administrator with bigger fish to fry. It became clear her mission was 1. to reduce her workload 2. to reduce the budget and 3. to do those things regardless of how it impacted student learning opportunities.\n\nIn the fall, she unilaterally imposed a rule that students would only be permitted to travel once per year with school permission. We challenged and held a meeting, and voiced our discontent. She kept the policy. We retaliated by getting stakeholder attorneys outside the law school together to write a letter to the Dean of the School. Then she rolled back the policy. This sort of thing happened all year - she would reduce student opportunities - we would push back. Suffice to say we were both fed up with each other by the end of the year, but we had also reached compromises on most of the friction-points.\n\nFinally April rolled around, and with graduation around the corner, I think she was under the impression that she could sneak one more policy change through the gates and I would not care. She shot me an email a few weeks before graduation \"formalizing\" the policy changes we had fought over all year. Except she rolled back the travel policy the administration had agreed to.\n\nThis was completely her style - no conversation - no discussion - just a top-down unilateral change that would make our lives difficult. I was vexed extra because we had already hashed this policy out earlier in the year and reached a compromise. I don't know if she thought I wouldn't notice or would be too tired to fight that close to graduation, but I figured I had nothing to lose. It should be emphasized that the policy she had created hurt students by restricting them from travelling, benefited her by allowing her to do less work, but otherwise did not benefit the law school in any way. The school was not bearing the cost of travel. They policy adopted merely denied students permission to travel.\n\nI hit the forward button and typed an email to the group of attorneys who had written the letter earlier in the year, explaining that the administration had just adopted the policy they had the Dean about earlier. In the email I included the policy she had written. I hit send.\n\nI then typed her an email explaining that I had just sent the policy along to the attorneys, and left it like that. Less than a minute later, I receive an email from her.\n\n\"That is an internal policy and I did not give you permission to release it outside the school. Please recall the email.\"\n\nSo I hopped onto the email chain with the attorneys and typed out a recall message. \"Dear Attorney Stakeholders, please note that Ms. Umbridge has requested this email be recalled. Please do not read the attached policy, as she has indicated it is an internal document and does not anyone outside the administration to have access to it or know its contents. Please consider my previous email recalled.\" Send.\n\nThen back to Dolores: \"I've sent an email recalling my previous email and let the coaches know that they are not to open the policy, since it is an internal document.\"\n\nUmbridge back to me: \"There is a feature in our emails that allow you to recall a message after having sent so it does not reach the intended recipient. Please recall the messages immediately.\"\n\nNow, maybe I'm technologically obtuse, but it took me a few minutes to google this feature. By the time I did, I learned that an email can only be recalled in a short amount of time after it is sent (~ 30 seconds to a minute).\n\nTo Umbridge: \"I see now what you meant. I just googled how to do that, and it seems the time frame necessary has passed and the written recall I sent the coaches will have to suffice.\"\n\nIn the meantime, one of the attorney stakeholders responded:\n\"Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, by the time I received your recall I had read the policy. Thank you for the update.\"\n\nAll was quiet on the Western Front for few days, when I received another email indicating she would like to meet with me the following week. I gladly acquiesced.\n\nThat meeting was the first time I have been screamed at by an adult professional in a white collar environment. The meeting lasted an hour. She asked me if I saw anything wrong with sending the internal policy to our external attorney stakeholders. I told her I did not. She then tried for a good five minutes to trap me in an honor code violation by getting me to admit I knew I was in the wrong. I stuck to my guns. If she had nothing to hide, then she should not have minded the policy getting out. She accused me of using the stakeholder attorneys as leverage. I agreed that that is exactly what I was doing, but that she was the source of her own pain since she was the one creating the policies. She then berated me for being unprofessional and asked if this was the reputation I wanted in the community. I told her I absolutely wanted to have the reputation of not rolling over when faced with a bully, fighting with passion for causes I believe in, and being a creative strategic advocate for my cause. After an hour, I got up and thanked her for her time and we parted ways.\n\nTo give you an idea of how bad the meeting was and how degraded our relationship was, she emailed me a few days later asking if I had recorded the conversation. Unfortunately, I had not.\n\nThe stakeholder attorneys ended up requesting a meeting with the Dean. He agreed, and they all went out and had a beer. Umbridge went along. The policy was rolled back. The attorney stakeholders are satisfied. The administration is satisfied, but the Dean certainly was not happy to have to deal with this petty bureaucratic nonsense.\n\nI have a job lined up after graduation. My boss knows I'm a fighter, and it turns out that's a desirable trait in litigation. Turns out I'll be alright after all. And it's good to know about that recall feature. That might come in handy some day.",

Their union had foolproof policies and procedures, and the manager of this one station didn't know any of them, because he didn't rise through the ranks, but jumped or was appointed or something.  Basically, Bossman (BM) didn't know what the union rules were concerning breaks.  He was also a jerk.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if the lineworker (LW) in question was a jerk or what, but he was a nice guy. He had given me multiple tours of the facilities and I was always fascinated by them. I had some basic electrical training as a teen at school, so I was basically talking shop to them, and when I was told of the incident in question, I went to the source to check it out.\n\nNo 1: Union Rules and Regs: the lineworkers get 60 minutes of uninterrupted time to eat their meals.  If their time is interrupted, the lunch break starts over again.\n\nCan you guess what happened?\n\nYup.  BM decided to bug LW when he was having his lunch and chilling.  So, the entire lunch started again.\n\nThis went on all afternoon.  LW would be near the end of his break, and BM decided to bug him again, and the lunch break started again.  Rinse, repeat for a week, and the other two LWs got into the act too.\n\nSo, big electric company was paying minimum $20/hr (back in 1990's) minimum for these guys to sit around and do nothing.  These guys were all journeymen or masters at their craft, and were into the $40-50/hr wages, and more for call outs.\n\nWhen BM figured out what was going on, he left the guys alone from 11:30 to 2:30, especially if he saw them sitting at the break room table.\n\ntldr: Union rules say \"leave my peeps alone.\" Boss don't.  Company pays hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on workers because breaks were interrupted.",

        "text": "I finally remembered one for this glorious sub! Sorry for any format issues, I’m on mobile. TL;DR at the bottom\n\nSo this takes place many years ago when I used I work at the only gas station in this little nook of a place that a lot of cottages and year round houses are. I was the gas jockey at full serve gas station but if people wanted to pump their own it was fine. Just I always tried to pump the diesel for customers because the diesel pump’s handle was finicky and tended to overflow (the overflow shutoff never worked properly).\n\nCue Local Dick (LD). He rolls in with what a John Deere tractor and parked it next to the diesel pump while I was with another car that was for a fill up so I just flicked the lever to keep the gas flowing while I went to see LD.\n\nMe: Hey LD, nice tractor I didn’t know you had one of those, how much do you need?\nLD: It’s not mine, it’s my bosses but I’ll pump this, she’s empty and you’ve got a car anyway, so I’ll be a while.\nMe: It’s no problem, this pump can be a bitch and sometimes won’t shut off when it’s full, I don’t want any to spill (I could tell by the noise it made if it was about to overflow or not)\nLD: No I said I got it, I’m in a hurry anyway (In a fuck you type of tone)\nMe: You sure?\nLD: YES!\nMe: Ookaay then!\n\nSo I went back the car I was with because their pump was finished and I took their card in to do the payment and when I came back out, the smell of diesel was unmistakable. I looked over and sure enough LD wasn’t paying attention and let it overflow a lot. Since this was a pretty big tractor, and it only took me like 2 minutes to run the payment back and forth, I knew something was wrong.\n\nAs I walked up to him and asked why it was done so fast, he started to panic about the spill all over his boss’ tractor. So went to clean it up from where it overflowed and I noticed not only wasn’t he paying attention to the pump, the reason why it happened so fast was because he mistook the radiator cap for the diesel cap and filled the rad with diesel. I don’t know why he was able to get so much diesel in there,\nI guess it was low on coolant.\n\nHe panicked when I told him and he asked me what he should do about it. I told him that I didn’t know, I just know where to put in fuel, and maybe next time let me do it. He even asked if he should move it out of the way and I said NO! Turns out he had to leave the tractor there and someone had to come and drain and flush the whole system. I never saw LD back there again in that tractor.\n\nTL;DR: Local Dick told me not to pump his boss’ tractor, proceeds to cause big spill that I warned him would happen, pumped the radiator full of diesel instead of where it’s supposed to.\n\n",

        "text": "This happened around ten years ago.\n\nThe office building in which I work sits on the very end of a row of separate-but-joined older buildings in a small, Midwestern town. Parking has always been problematic as there are only two dozen spaces shared by about ten to fifteen businesses. While these are public parking spaces and anyone can park in them, there had always been an effort made to keep them free for customers by having all employees park in the private gravel parking lot behind the buildings. While we were not one of the lot’s three owners, for well over two decades there had been a common understanding that we could park back there because they’d rather we not take up spaces needed by paying customers. \n\nMy vehicle at the time was small so I chose to park in the gravel lot at the very end of the mostly unused access alley, right on the corner where no other car could fit. This meant that not only was I not using a customer space, I wasn’t taking any space from any of the other employees either. \n\nOne day while parking in my usual spot, an attorney who rented an office in the same location came out and angrily demanded I move. This attorney and I had a bit of a history as she had been the counsel for the company I had worked for previously and since she was a lousy attorney, the company had parted on less than amicable terms with her. It was also common knowledge in our town that she was just an unpleasant person to deal with.\n\nI refused to move, pointing out that since I was technically parked in the alley and that it was a public right-of-way, she had no legal standing to tell me I couldn’t park there. This pissed her off even more and later that day she faxed a very snotty letter to my office, stating she was the legal representative of one of the lot’s property owners and demanded we stop parking in the rear.\n\nRather than fight the issue, everyone in my office started parking in the public spaces out front, thus making it that much more difficult for customers to find a convenient place to park. This didn’t affect us that much because we’re in a service industry that doesn’t rely on walk-in clientele whereas almost all our neighbors were retail. As for me, since my day began early enough, I was always able to snag the public space directly in front of the lawyer’s office. So not only did she have to stare at my car from her office every single weekday, none of her clients would ever be able to park in the most convenient spot.\n\nThis was not my last confrontation with the lawyer (which ultimately involved being interviewed by a police detective) but that’s another story. If anyone is interested, I’d be happy to provide those details in another post.\n\ntldr- A snotty lawyer demanded I stop parking in a space that wasn’t being used so I stole the best space available for her clients.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFOLLOW UP (as requested)\n\nOne day I received a call from one of my old bosses from the collection agency I had worked for that had also employed the horrible attorney. My old boss said she’d received a call from a police detective investigating some threatening letters that had allegedly been mailed to our old lawyer (her name was Michelle). According to my boss, the officer seemed to be of the opinion that Michelle may have been mailing them to herself. We spent some time debating whether or not she was that crazy before deciding the letters were probably real. Enough people in the area hated her. In fact, someone had once vandalized her office by spray painting a swastika on the front of the building (Michelle was Jewish). Sadly, racism and anti-Semitism isn’t exactly unheard of in this area, so that could have just been a bored redneck.\n\nLater that day I also received a call from the detective. Considering the parking problems I’d recently had with Michelle, it was obvious she’d told the police that the letters could have been from me. The detective asked if I would stop by the station and discuss the matter. I denied knowing anything about the letters but I also flat out told him I couldn’t stand Michelle and wasn’t inclined to do anything to help her. It was obvious he didn’t care for Michelle either and didn’t want the job. He also asked if I thought she might be crazy enough to be sending the letters to herself. I told him as awful as she was, it was very probable that plenty of people disliked her enough to send hate mail.\n\nA few weeks went by before the detective made a follow-up call. He sounded exasperated and asked me once again if I would come in and talk to him. I asked if I was under investigation or if I needed a lawyer or if I was subject to arrest if I refused. He said no to all three but that it would at least make his life a lot easier if he could tell Michelle he had interviewed me. This was over a decade ago and there is no way I would have agreed to meet with him like that nowadays, but at the time I was more inclined to trust the police so I agreed to the interview. I visited the police station and met with the detective. He explained that Michelle had been getting these letters for quite some time and that she’d just received another one. He handed me a binder with perhaps a few dozen letters in total. They were mostly typed or printed from a dot matrix printer (which I was relieved to see because I didn’t have access to one so it would be a lot harder if she was determined to pin them on me). Funny enough, while the letters were extraordinarily vile, calling her every foul name possible and making very pointed comments on her looks, her sexuality and general merit as a woman, none of them actually seemed threatening. They didn’t mention violence nor make any promises of harm. In fact, most sounded like the ravings of an angry ex-boyfriend or lover. I was careful to handle them only by the edges to avoid fingerprints (despite the detective telling me not to worry about that) and I finished by once again denying they came from me. I also told him they sounded like an ex-client she screwed over or an ex-lover angry at being dumped. The detective thanked me for my time and I was on my way.\n\nA few weeks later after a busy snowstorm, I was pulling in to the usual spot in front of Michelle’s office. Unfortunately, she was outside shoveling the walk next to the parking space and was extremely disheveled, out of breath with her face very red and her curly hair frazzled.  When she saw my car, her face changed to a manic expression of wide-eyed, fake friendliness, waving me into my spot with a crazed grimace and wide, exaggerated motions like a runway tech waving at taxiing planes. I pulled in, got out of my car and said hello as I walked past her.\n\n“You can kill me!” she yelled behind me. “My family will be taken care of! You can kill me and it won’t matter!”\n\nI stopped, turned and even though I knew exactly what she was insinuating, said “What the hell are you talking about?”\n\nShe repeated that her family would be taken care of if something happened to her. I told her she was insane. I turned my back to her and started walking away. The sidewalk was treacherous from the snow and I briefly lost my footing, barely managing to keep from slipping.\n\n“Fall! Fall! Fall!” she screamed at me.\n\nIgnoring the crazy lady with the snow shovel, I entered my office, immediately sat down at my desk, picked up the phone and called the detective. \n\n“Remember how I told you that I didn’t think Michelle was crazy enough to send those letters to herself?” I explained, “I may have changed my mind,” before explaining the interaction I’d just had with her.\n\nI never spoke to the detective (or Michelle) again, but it reached me through my old boss that the police did eventually find someone who was likely the letter writer, but I never learned what happened after that.",

        "text": "So this happened quite a few months ago but reading through some of these stories made me want to post it - I hope it is what you’d consider relevant for this sub.\n\nIt has become the worlds worst kept secret that the management at the company I work for get bonuses based on different targets being met and they can be very generous if all targets are met, not just the odd one or two.\n\nOne of these targets is customer satisfaction. When an enquiry or complaint comes in, we have 2 working days to resolve it or to at least have provided a satisfactory response to be within the expected standards of the governing body that represents our industry. If we achieve an average lower than those 48 hours over the year, we get financial reward (by we, I mean the company who don’t share any of it with the staff that do the work but so-so).\n\nOur manager is always desperate for us to get enquiries and complaints resolved on the day they come in even though our reward is based on ‘within 2 working days’ even if the customer contact comes in 15 minutes before the end of the working day. No-one really understands why he is desperate for a quick resolution when it doesn’t effect the company if it waits until the next morning, until someone overhears him bragging about the size of his bonus this year and explaining that he gets rewarded more if our department performs better than the target set by the governing body. Again, none of the staff that deal with the work get anything and he is the kind of guy that brags about his money and extravagant purchases to the staff that are struggling to pay their rent.\n\nSo one day, a complaint comes in and it is passed to me. Run of the mill stuff, customer wants to try and push for cheaper work even though they have the lowest possible cost we can do. I try calling multiple times and get no answer so it looks like it will have to wait until morning. \n\nHe comes over asking me to stick around until the complaint is resolved. I tell him I can stay for half an hour after close of play with overtime pay because I have plans but no, that’s not good enough. ‘I want you here until it is resolved’. I go online and find out the number is registered to a shop which shuts at 5. I ask him what time he wants me to stay until. ‘How long can you stay if I pay you double time?’ He asks. I tell him 11pm (I only live 10 minutes walk from work so not a major deal about commuting home late). He takes the deal, even goes as far as nominating me for a £20 reward for going above and beyond not realising I spent the next 6 hours watching Netflix because there was no possible way of speaking with the customer and occasionally updating the job to say ‘call made, no answer’. \n\nCan’t complain about taking home 12 hours additional pay + a £20 voucher for watching Netflix, which was made even better by the fact I knew I couldn’t resolve the complaint and he wouldn’t be getting that fraction more of a bonus as a result.",

        "text": "A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8o3l9e/the_fast_lane_is_for_fast_swimmers/) from u/schedenfiend yesterday knocked loose this old story from my high school swimming days.\n\nSome background: I went to a rural school in the middle of nowhere. We had a pool and a swim team, and neither were very good. The boys' and girls' team hadn't won a meet in years, and no one on the team took it very seriously. It was mostly something people did for fun over the winter to stay in shape between their main summer sports.\n\nI was always a strong swimmer. It was the only sport I did so I put more into it. As soon as I could drive I joined a summer swim program at a nearby school that regularly won state titles. I was never fast enough to make it to state, but sucking in the pool during the summers with a state level team meant I got good by \"back home\" standards. I could win my event, the breast stroke, against every school in our conference and got into the last round at sectionals which no one else on our team ever did. Think medium\\-sized fish in a very small pond.\n\nCute the malicious compliance story. Back at my regular school, after I'd been doing summer swimming for a couple of years, our coach had us do an exercise where we had to swim a long distance in our main event. I swam in the \"fast\" lane and I was usually out front, but this time around a girl we'll call Cindy stopped me before we got going.\n\nCindy: No way. You're not going first.\n\nMe: What?\n\nCindy: Coach said we're supposed to swim our main event. That's freestyle for us \\(crawl stroke, usually the fastest way to move through the water\\) and you're breast stroke \\(think swimming like a frog, and usually it's slower than crawl stroke\\).\n\nMe: You're serious?\n\nCindy: Yeah, you'll slow us down. Start swimming at the back of the line.\n\nI shrugged. I knew how fast we were relative to each other and thought I should be up front, but if she wanted me swimming at the back of the line because I was swimming a \"slow\" stroke and everyone else in the fast lane was doing crawl stroke? Sure. I'd play along. Besides, she said start at the back.\n\nSo we start this long swim. Cindy starts off with a smug smile and everyone follows. Because of everyone going ahead of me I didn't get going until Cindy was coming back after doing a length. I go at a pace I'll be able to maintain for the set. No point killing myself to make a point, but I figured I could have some fun without killing myself.\n\nLong story short, by the end of a few pool lengths I was ahead of everyone but Cindy. I was tickling her feet every time I sliced through the water, the universal signal for \"get the fuck out of the way\" on our team, but she refused to move. So finally on a turn I went under her off the wall, came up ahead, and finished the set.\n\nI finished about a full length ahead of everyone else. Cindy comes up and stares daggers while everyone else starts hitting the wall and having a good laugh at her expense. She called me a jerk, and I explained that I said I'd start at the back of the line, but I didn't say anything about staying there.",

The meeting consists of the foreman asking the men if there's any safety or health hazards they've noticed and would like to see corrected. After that's over, they ask one of the apprentices to read the weekly safety briefing out loud to everyone. It's a document that talks about a specific safety topic we should know, like how to use fall restraint systems or how to reduce fire hazards in one's work space.\n\nThis week it was my turn to read the safety briefing. It was about electrical shocks and electrocutions and how to avoid such an event. Unfortunately for me the documents was 4 pages long and I had no intention of reading the entire document word for word. So I started off by reading just a few key sentences and points, just to get it over with and because everyone knows how electricity works and the hazards of it. My foreman interrupts and says \"Mercurydriver, I didn't ask you to make a brief summary. I want you to actually read the papers in front of you as they are.\"\n\nI knew he was busting my balls, so I went along with it. I respond \"You want me to read it exactly as it is verbatim? Got it.\" So I did just that. I started from the beginning of the 4 page document and read every. Single. Word. I read it slowly, took my time reading it out loud to the guys and basically made sure I wasted as much time as possible while covering all of the key points of the briefing. I took 10 minutes to read through it all and by the end of it I could see in everyone's face that they just wanted it to be over.\n\nSure I annoyed the foreman a bit and got called a smart ass by some of the men in my crew but it was so worth it.",

        "text": "Admittedly this didn't happen recently - this was many more years ago than I care to admit, way back when I was still a student at University, studying Computer Science. [Cue wobbly lines, travelling back in time...]\n\nVery late one night sitting in the computer lab at University, a friend of mine and I received a very convincing looking phishing email, clearly targeting students at our university, looking for email logins and passwords. If it wasn't for the fact we are proudly geeky and technically minded, we might have fallen for it - one of the better crafted phishing mails I've seen in a very long time.\n\nAfter reporting the scam to the network admin, we decided to have some fun. Being Comp Sci students, we had access to not only some server space, but plenty of free time and development tools. Less than an hour later, we had a small script set up which would access the phishing site, generate realistic-looking but fake accounts (using a dictionary of real names), and generate realistic-looking but fake passwords. The script would then submit one of these fake logins to the phishing site with a random time between each submission - at which point we turned it on, and forgot about it.\n\nA few weeks later we checked in, and discovered the phishing site had received hundreds of thousands of our fake farmed accounts... and from there we left it running until our accounts got disabled when we left the university.\n\nIt still makes me happy to this day to think back and realise someone who had spent their time building a site designed to prey on the vulnerable and steal their login details had spent all that time just to be left with a database filled with potentially millions of account details, none of which would work. Even if others had fallen for the trick and entered their real email / password, it would have been a case of the attackers finding a \"needle in a haystack\".\n\ntl;dr - we purposely maliciously responded to a phishing scam email with so many fake accounts the attackers would end up with a giant, useless database of fake accounts.",

I work as a waitress for a chain Mexican restaurant that also does carry outs and pick ups. It's a very laid back job and my GM is chill. I recently got a promotion to become a trainer. I went to the class and have already gone through training so I thought that was it. About 2 days after the class my GM comes to me and tells me I didn't complete the training test. He has to submit the test to corporate so I can get my raise. It's the end of my shift and I'm tired and just want to go home. My GM says I can leave after I complete the test and not to clock out until it's finished. \n\nAs I grab the test and sit down in the dining room he reminds me to be very thorough. There are like 7 questions but I'm still slightly annoyed that I have to complete this. The first question is what is the proper take-out procedure? I decide I'm going to have a little fun since I'm getting paid anyway so I start a list. \n\nStep 1. make sure you are clocked in\n\nStep 2. walk to the expo station\n\nStep 3. confirm the boxes on the station are take-outs\n\nStep 4. take out your pen\n\nStep 5. write the time on the top of the ticket\n\nStep 6. call out the time to the kitchen\n\nStep 7. pick up the take out boxes\n\nStep 8. walk to take-out expo table\n\nStep 9. place boxes on expo station table\n\n\nAnyway I write out every step trying to cover EVERYTHING. About 15 minutes later my GM asks me how's it going and I tell him I'm almost finished with the first question. I then ask him if I can have another piece of paper. He walks over with the paper and just stares at my test. He starts to laugh after reading my steps. I tell him that since I'm a trainer now if a new trainee was reading this I would make sure they new exactly what to do. I take the piece of paper and continue.\n \nI finish the first question with 57 steps and I look at the second question... What is the proper way to greet a guest? I finally finished the test an hour later and I gave it to my GM along with 3 more pieces of paper filled. At that point I was happy and tired and I thought that would be the end of it as I left. \n\nAbout a week later the regional manager come to visit our store. Nothing special since he does random visits all the time but when he sees me he pulls me to the side. He proceeds to tell me that he has to grade the tests for all the stores and when he got to my test with the 3 extra papers stapled to it he thought it was a joke. He read through everything and I got a perfect score but now there is a new policy in place. The tests where just to confirm that people knew what they were doing and now will be administered by the GM verbally. The GM's will then report back to the regional managers with pass or fail statements. I'm pretty sure the regional manager was already looking for a way to get out of grading the tests it still makes me laugh to think about. \n\nTL;DR: GM told me to be thorough when completing a test. I went over and beyond and now the tests are done verbally.",

        "text": "This happened to me some years back while I was still an undergrad at university in the UK. I had ordered a 32 inch TV for my flat from Tesco and opted to collect the TV from the nearest store that did pickups/collection. Cool! I was happy to be going to get a flat\\-screen TV  to connect and play with my ps3 \\(this was in 2008\\). Little did I know the trouble that was waiting for me.\n\nThis Tesco store had the collections area near the entrance before you walk some few metres to the supermarket. So, both the collections area and the supermarket are in the same massive room without any demarcation except a few metres of space. I went to collect the TV and I had to present the confirmation of purchase email \\(the email is important for later\\) in order to collect it. I got the TV in its packaging with no hassle. I decided to also do some grocery shopping and so, I kept the TV \\(which was quite heavy\\) in a trolley and went to the supermarket area. \n\nI finish the the grocery shopping and go to the till. I put the groceries on the counter but the cashier then asks about the TV. I reply that I have already paid for it as I bought it online and collected it from the collections area. But for some reason, she says that it is possible that I took it from the supermarket shelf \\(they also sell TVs in the supermarket area\\). I then presented the confirmation of purchase email to as proof that I bought it online. She then says with a loud and angry voice, *\"I CANNOT READ THE EMAIL AND IT IS NOT A RECEIPT. YOU CANNOT LEAVE WITH THE TV UNLESS YOU PAY FOR IT\"*. \n\nIt was at that point that I lost my temper and told her that she is quite daft for trying to say that I was trying to steal the TV which I had already paid for. I also pointed out that there must be CCTV cameras and so they could easily check where I got the TV from. Her supervisor \\(another woman\\) came along and supported her by saying that since I did not have a receipt, I did not get it from the collections area. The supervisor repeated that I could not leave with the TV.\n\nI quickly noticed that almost everyone was starting to stare \\(probably because I  was shouting and I am a black guy with a foreign accent\\) and also that a large queue was starting to form as there were only two tills open at the time\\-  and I was holding up one of the tills. A quick idea for malicious compliance came into my head\\- ***they said that I can't leave with my TV and so I will stay!***\n\nI then just said, \"make your move\" and kept quiet. The queue kept piling up, and to my luck, the queue at the other till was not moving fast as well. So after about  fifteen to twenty awkward minutes of angry customers mumbling about the hold up behind me and the supervisor deliberating what to do,two more staff come over to see what is happening. They talk with the supervisor and then she comes over and asks to see my TV. As she is looking at it, realisation dawns on her face \\(I noticed her reaction but didn't understand why\\).\n\nThe supervisor noticed that a name \\(my name\\) was on the TV packaging  which means that I actually bought it online. She then explained it to me and apologised in a very squeaky voice probably because it was humbling for her. I was still angry and so, I told her that she was daft for not checking the packaging in the first place. The supervisor then left to get me a receipt from the collection area. The cashier, feeling foolish, just scanned my remaining grocery items silently with her head down. I left, but not without telling her that she should be more sensible in the future. However, it did not end there. \n\nApparently, the police was called sometime during the shout\\-fest. The police arrived as soon as I collected my receipt from the supervisor at the collection area. After talking to the police, the police warned the supervisor and another staff there that they could easily be charged  for unlawful detention had the matter escalated. They had no proof that I stole anything and they chose not to confirm with the collection area in the first place whether I had bought the TV, but they still chose to say that I should not leave.\n\nTLDR\\- I bought a TV online and opted to collect it at a Tesco store. I collected it from the collection area and proceeded to the supermarket area to buy some groceries. At the till, the cashier and supervisor did not believe that I bought the TV and refused to let me leave with the TV. I maliciously complied by waiting till they were pressured to do something and then, they saw the errors of their ways. Even the police that later came, sided with me.",

They haven't yet figured out that my wife is the woman that's with me and that's whose account we're dealing with. \n\nBefore they roll off to the back to grab the tablet, the rep asks me if I want to add the upgrade plan/insurance to this purchase. I decline. I don't have a need for insurance on a tablet of all things. He runs off to the back, grabs the tablet, comes back and tries to sell me on the insurance again, plus accessories. I decline, again.\n\nThis time, he cuts in with the \"are you sure? It's a really good deal...\" Yes. I'm sure. \"But you can upgrade every 3 months!\" No, I'm fine.\n\nThat's when a neighboring rep senses that he can maybe help his buddy sell, and starts reiterating that I really should buy the insurance. NO. How many damn times do I have to tell you. After which the *store manager* notices, cuts in, and attempts to cancel the transaction unless I buy the insurance. Normally, I should have walked, but this was at a time where I only had my two feet to get me places and this was the only store remotely close to me. I argued that they couldn't do that before the store manager looked at the account and noticed that this was my wife's account, not mine.\n\n(**Here's the malicious compliance bit.**)\n\nSM and the rep came to the conclusion that my wife must be an idiot, and they could convince her to override my decision, because as per policy, the primary account holder has the final say, right? So they demand to speak to my wife. She tells them no, I'm the one paying for this, and she's not getting involved. \n\nSM tries to say that my wife needs to finish the transaction for security purposes. I protest, but at this point, I'm just like...okay, you really want to speak to my wife and let her finish the transaction so badly?\n\nFine. Have fun. I tried to save you guys from getting massacred. I know that the whole \"the PAH has to finish the transaction for security purposes\" is a bullshit, made up on the spot policy. But you know what? Fine. I'll roll with it. Because my wife is going to verbally asskick you so hard you'll kiss the moon.\n\nShe immediately flips the proverbial table in their faces, telling them that if they don't drop the predatory sales tactics, back off, and sell the tablet without insurance, to call care from their in-store phones so she can cancel her account and switch to $OtherTelecom, because she won't stand for being treated like this. Further, she'll be sending an email with every known exec email cc'd detailing the horrible experience we had today. It doesn't sound like much when I type this, but trust me when I say that I can count on half a hand in my 6 years with this woman that I have ever heard her speak with such disgust and anger but in a calm and collected manner.\n\nThey immediately processed everything and apologized profusely, because they didn't anticipate that my wife works in sales and is *very* savvy to this type of bullshit. They probably expected to have it easy once they got past me, but...nope.\n\nTrue to her word, she emailed corporate, and we got some huge bill credits for our trouble *and* that store manager and rep were never seen again. Not sure if they got fired or shuffled off to another store, but we never saw them again at our local store.",

        "text": "People who weren't there probably can never really understand the degree of turmoil of the changing of the guard that occurred across western societies during the late 60s and 70s. Attitudes, morals, music, dress and automatic deference to authority figures etc etc, all underwent drastic change. And in many cases, the established old guard (those upright unbending generations of ww2 and the 50s) were ill-equipped to even begin to understand just what was going on, let alone know how to deal with it.\n\nOur catholic boys school had had our class-year disrupting/destroying their ancient traditions and rituals for ~8 or 9years. More rambunctious and fearless with each passing year their exploits were spoken of in growing awe throughout that small capital city.\n\nThe school principal and admin were completely stymied in that their \"assumed\" authority was just ignored and their very enthusiastically delivered corporal punishment was somewhat shrugged off and contemptuously acknowledged as the last refuge of the incompetent. (Please understand \"the strap\" was brutal, and to be avoided at all costs, especially when wielded by fit strong facistic fetishic and sadistic christian brothers hoping to quell the inevitable tide of societal change through pain, ....but if the game was worth the candle, then six'o the best was a painful price worth paying. ......And obviously, it was vastly superior to just not get caught.)\n\nAnyway, after a series of wild weekend deviancies and carousing events by the classes crews made the news with bonus police involvement, the principal and admins decided that even just the chance of the school's name being besmirched by the rabble class demanded definite and heavy preemptive action.\n\nSo they penned a Proclamation to be taken home by every student and to be sighted and signed by all parents and returned to the school.\nIt said (paraphrasing 40+years later ...but in essence and intent)\n\n...for future reference, any group of three or more students of (XXX College) meeting together, anywhere at anytime, is to be considered an \"official school meeting\" whether on the school property or off, and as such requires the school being immediately informed of each and every meeting.\n\nAnd it was a remarkably effective tool, they got exactly what they demanded.\n\nThe christian brothers lived their strange monastic lives in beautiful old buildings on the school grounds. They had an after hours contact number that rang very loud in their communal living space. It took only one week&amp;weekend of relentless, multiple, dutiful and maliciously compliant 3-4am drunken and hellacious phonecalls from the hard partying crew to have the \"school meeting\" directive quietly and utterly withdrawn.",

        "text": "This happened about 10yrs ago in my Army days during a deployment. I was in a scout platoon (19D) and we had been tasked to set up a screen line on a long empty stretch of road on the outskirts of a town where a task force operation was going on. Essentially we were sitting in place intercepting anyone fleeing from the town for an operation lasting days, so it got incredibly boring, incredibly fast. We did what we could to keep ourselves entertained, while still trying to stay vigilant and not get complacent. Pretty delicate balancing act.     \n\nNow our platoon sergeant (SFC) had a tendency to be bipolar, switching back and forth from unyielding hard-ass dickbag, to happy, friendly, and just goofy AF. This made him generally unpleasant to deal with at any given point in time, as both extremes of his personality were very annoying. So to set the scene, we have been sitting in our humvees in one spot stretched along the road, waiting and watching diligently for 3 days.\n\nI was the Lieutenant's (LT) gunner, and we were passing time as best we could, talking, eating, listening to music on tiny speakers, etc, when the platoon sergeant got bored and started playing on the radio(on our platoon freq, which is only monitored by us). Over the course of hours, he would radio our truck to talk to the LT, just to be silly and pass the time. (apparently his truck had got tired of talking to him, and he was bored) So for hours we hear shit like,  \nSFC - \"Hey Red 1(LT's callsign), this is Red 4, over (SFC's callsign)\"  \nLT - \"4 this is 1, what's up, over\"  \nSFC - \"Whatcha thinkin bout?\"  \n  \n\n\nAfter a few hours of this type of nonsense, my LT is annoyed beyond measure, and stops answering the radio for him. This only encourages the SFC to spam platoon freq even more.  Finally the LT looks at me and says 'you answer that shit, I'm sick of dealing with his bullshit.' Haha, NO PROBLEM SIR.\n\nIf you've been deployed, you know that bootleg music and movies are the main way you stay entertained, and I probably had close to every song known to man downloaded on my Ipod at that point, including random things like slow jazz, classical, and other assorted elevator type music. So I grab the radio, and in my best automated voice impression I say\n\"Hello, you've reached the 1 truck. All of our associates are currently busy at the moment, so please stay on the line and a representative will be with you shortly.\"  \n\nNow that in and of itself could easily have earned me an ass-chewing, but I felt compelled to go the extra mile and held the mic up to my Ipod speakers playing a very mellow sax arrangement of the Girl from Ipanema. On a military radio, if someone is speaking on that frequency, you can't key over them until they stop broadcasting. So my LT is looking at me kinda stunned (so are the other gunners I can see in their humvees) as I play that music for a good 60 seconds or so, tying up our platoon freq and forcing SFC to listen to this.   \n\nI pull the mic away from the speakers and LT looks relieved, thinking the joke is over, but at this point I say, \"Your call is very important to us. Please stay on the line and our next available representative will be with you shortly.\" Then he gets another 60 seconds or so of Girl from Ipanema. When I finally release the mic, and the platoon net is clear, my LT, our dismounts, and every other gunner is dying laughing, but SFC doesn't respond, and even the LT is afraid to call back there, as SFC has a history of doing 180s on his bipolar switch at the slightest provocation. \n\nSo after a good 5 min or so, we finally hear the mic beep as SFC gets on to answer me, \"Red 1g (my callsign), if that wasn't the funniest shit I've ever heard, you'd be in serious shit right now. Put Red1 back on the mic and stay off the fucking radio.\"  \n\nTL;DR - Platoon Sgt is being annoying on the radio, LT gets tired of it, tells me to deal with it. Which I do, by putting him on hold, complete with elevator waiting music.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I don't make text posts often so I apologize if there are any formatting issues ahead of time.\n\nThis happened a few days ago at a local community swimming pool. As expected of any community center, you get people of all different levels of athletic prowess there, so the standard of \"fast\" in the \"fast swimming lane\" is usually set pretty low because a lot of elderly frequent come here. Regardless, I went in on a day that wasn't too busy, but busy enough for me to become 1 of 3 people that occupied the fast lane. \n\nThere was one very slow swimmer (SS) who happened to be in the lane doing god knows what, an impatient swimmer (IS) who isn't slow but definitely not the fastest (seeing as I've caught up to him several times and eventually swam past), and myself. It's also common etiquette to switch to a slower lane if you find yourself being passed too many times by faster swimmers.\n\nAt some point, SS started swimming at a snail's pace dead center in the lane, with myself right behind him. Since he was swimming right in the center, I couldn't swim past him, so I slowed down to look for an opportunity to do so. But doing so only gave IS the opportunity to finally catch up to me from behind. \n\nI get a tap on my shoulder in the middle of the pool, only to have IS rudely push past me and say, \"The fast lane is for fast swimmers only, and you're too slow to be here!\" After he pushes past me, he catches up with SS to say the same thing and kick SS out of the lane.\n\nSo I got pretty annoyed at that, because I was not the one who was slow in this lane. I was slow because I was held back by SS who was in front of me. And normally, I'd gladly switch to a medium speed lane if an athlete happened to be training. But in this case, IS wasn't an athlete by any means since, like I said earlier, I already caught up to him several times before this.\n\nSo of course, I do what he asks. The fast lane is for fast swimmers, right? \n\nI speed up and start swimming faster -- fast enough to catch up to IS, but never passing. Just always there behind him, almost able to touch his toes in front of me, and always being there when he'd get to the end of the lane so that the moment he turns around, he sees me trailing closely behind him, always pressuring him to swim faster to increase the gap between us. But once again, always right behind and never passing.\n\nAfter doing this for about 5 laps, I eventually get bored and get out of the pool to go to the change room. \n\nI've never seen anyone look so relieved to see me go.",

I was at the theater seeing that new Deadpool movie. Funny Stuff!\n\nASM/SM: Uh-Huh... The thing is, you are normally on a set rotation.

As we all know, the ScheduleRight/CustomerFirst scheduling system is making the best possible decisions with regard to hourly associate schedules.\n\nASM/SM: You didn't come to work on a day of your normal rotation. The CAP2 Supervisor and the Grocery Support Manager had to cover for you. That placed an unreasonable strain on the store.\n\nME: I am an hourly associate employed by this company.

        "text": "I worked for an international furniture store for a few years in the mid 2000s. My job included helping customers load flat packed furniture, couches, kitchens, and some assembled floor models into their vehicles as well as retrieving hundreds of shopping carts from a massive parking lot. Needless to say, I was busy on the slowest of days.\n\nBack in 2006 the store was having it's annual \"midnight madness sale\". It's about 10:30 pm when I get paged on my radio to help a woman bring a kitchen from the \"Furniture Pick\\-Up / Drop\\-off Counter\" past 20 or so busy cashier desks &amp; a bistro to the loading dock &amp; of course help her load it. Now usually this is an easy task but this is the busiest store in the city, on one of the busiest days of the year and there's line\\-ups everywhere including the drop\\-off counter where dozens of people have their shopping carts scattered waiting to drop them off for delivery and she has a huge pallet with an unassembled kitchen on it including cabinets, counters, drawers, hardware, backsplash (basically everything except for appliances) on it which was approximately 8 ft long X 5 ft wide.\n\nAll things considered, I got to the counter rather quickly \\(within 3 minutes from being paged\\) so she wasn't waiting on me very long. When I saw her pallet I jokingly said to my co\\-worker working the desk \"Whoa! Talk about mission impossible\". I didn't realize she was right beside me when I heard her say \"Well F#&amp;#37;king get it done!\". Not the nicest of first impressions but  I was swamped with work and not in the mood so I just sucked it up and pulled this massive pallet through the corridor while getting dozens of people to move dozens of carts and their oblivious children out of the way.\n\nThis should've only taken 2 minutes but it took at least 10 minutes. The whole time she was complaining about how busy it was and how long everything is taking as if it was somehow my fault that she decided to pickup her kitchen during the busiest sale of the year at a time when the store is usually closed.\n\nI finally get to the loading dock and politely asked her to bring her car up. She asked me to bring the pallet to her car and I said I can't due to safety reasons so she said in frustration \"Ugh! Fine!\". I had never actually heard someone exclaim \"Uuuugh!\" before. I thought it was just inserted in comic strips for emphasis but here we were. I kindly requested that she reverse park her vehicle to make loading easier &amp; she said \"Yeah. Sure.\"\n\nI reserved a spot for her and helped a few other customers while waiting for her and she parks nose first and gets out of her minivan. I immediately ask her to park the other way since it's difficult to carry items between vehicles &amp; dangerous to load items walking into the parking lot. She started raising her voice \"You are here to help me! Not the other way around! Stop complaining!\". I explained that I'm not allowed to load the way she is parked \\(I am but it's double the work and dangerous especially with a kitchen which is conservatively 50 small\\-large\\) so I can't help her load. So she says \"Fine! I'll do it myself! Bring it closer... puh\\-lease!\" So I jacked up the pallet and moved it exactly to where she instructed me to. I asked her if she's sure she doesn't just want to turn the car around. She replied \"No! Just lower it and go!\" So I did. Right onto her foot.\n\nThe pallet was massive so I couldn't see that her right foot was underneath it when she asked me to lower it so she she first calmly says \"You lowered it on me foot\" I had an *Oh Shit Moment* and started to jack it up which took no more than 5 seconds. While I'm jacking it up she starts making a scene yelling \"You dropped it on my foot! You dropped it on my foot! Ahhhh!\". To be fair it might've hurt depending on the positioning of her foot but I've seen people who are in genuine pain as well as poor actors &amp; toddlers throwing tantrums and fake crying to get their way and her cries for help were as disingenuous as a 3 year old who can't have ice cream.\n\nOnce the pallet was off, she sat down on the bench and said \"Ow, ow, ow. I need an ambulance\" so I said \"Okay\", went to the security office which was right beside the exit. Told them what happened, they called an ambulance and paged my manager. I explained to my manager \"She asked me to lower the pallet, so I did. I couldn't see that she placed her foot underneath it\" he held back a chuckle and immediately went back to his poised boss stance and said \"This is serious but you need to go back to work\".\n\nMy manager took roughly 30 minutes to load her car \\(still parked nose first\\) which was satisfying for other reasons. While he did this, the ambulance came and left. At the end of my shift I asked my manager if she was okay. She was rude but I still wanted to make sure she was alright. I didn't care that much for the job. At the time it paid well but it was hard work and thankless so I couldn't care less if I got fired or not. He said that her foot was completely fine and that she confirmed my story that she asked me to lower it but she still wanted me to be \"punished\" for what I did since I was operating the pallet jack. He told her that he would make sure I was taught a lesson. He handed me an incident report &amp; said \"Paperwork sucks &amp; so do some people. Fill this out\". I filled it out but it was more so a record of what happened in case she tried to sue the store \\(which I don't think she did\\).

Paperwork does suck &amp; so do some people.\n\nTLDR; A customer refused my simple request so that I could help her load her minivan so she decided to do it herself. She asked me to lower her pallet with a kitchen on it while her foot was under it and then threw a toddler caliber tantrum. Her foot was fine. She wanted me to be punished but I only had to fill out a standard incident\n\nNote: This sub has quickly become my favorite since discovering it last month.

        "text": "Hello all, this might be a little wholesome for this subreddit but here goes \\(FYI  I am being intentionally vague with the details so I can't be traced\\).\n\nThe background is that our company went through a massive restructure a couple of years ago. Many good people were squeezed out and the rest of us barely hung on. To top it off they had brought in an expensive consultancy who told us that we were losing too much money, hence the layoffs. As usual the redundancies didn't reach past middle\\-management level and the upper echelons all received bonuses for their hard work in laying off the rest of us. Needless to say many of us are still a little sore.\n\nIt was decided recently that following this restructure we should create a new Team Charter to outline our purpose, define our scope and to reflect the new directions we are taking. However, since morale was at and all time low and it was decided that bulk of this new Charter should be crowd\\-sourced by the remaining staff. I could see why they thought this might be a good idea, if we help to come up with our own Corporate Mission then we would be more likely to have pride in the company again.\n\nHowever, the North remembers.\n\nWe sat through several presentations trying to get us to define our new charter, countless cups of coffee drunk, many trays of fancy biscuits consumed, quite a few games of buzzword bingo were played. I went on at least three workshop days myself where we covered a very professional looking board with our ideas in post\\-it notes with the sole intention to stretch this out as long as possible. Each day at a workshop was a late start \\(in at 9.30 to start at 10am\\); drinks, snacks and lunch and \\(best of all\\) we would finish for the day at around 3pm.\n\nIt couldn't last forever though, the Senior Management eventually gave us a strict deadline and insisted that if we couldn't come up with a Charter by the end of the day with an overall majority then they would be going with their own idea.\n\nFine by us. So after months of workshops we called a vote which as passed unanimously and Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present our company's new Team Charter in its entirety...\n\n\"Be Excellent To Each Other\"\n\n\\(We really tried to get Party On Dudes too \\- they managed to strike that, something something professionalism\\)",

        "text": "Heads Up: Throw away and some vague areas for anonymity as I like having a job reference, on mobile, and can’t spell yada yada \n\nSo a few years ago my first job out of university was in sales for medium to big (for my country) financial institution. This company had an odd bonus structure. Contracts stated bonuses were at the discretion of the company, not written into the contract. They could dangle them and apply all sorts of fuckery. \n\nAs you know (and people reminded us of a lot) finance jobs got good bonuses when we achieved sales and profit targets. But when we when you exceeded those targets it would be Wolf of Wall Street living. \n\nOf course these targets were always either too high, or, how they were calculated was fiddled with in the mid year to make sure they weren’t achievable for most. Over the last 15 years there have been times where sales went gang busters and you could easily hit target on inbound queries alone. But somehow few really hit the big commission rates and bonus money??\n\nMorale started dropping, as soon as staff knew they would not hit a bonus, then why bother selling. When the method of calculating sales was messed with, people stopped selling. \n\nStaff were getting openly negative about company and manglement realises this too late. People are quitting in hordes. \n\nSo the company’s board puts it to upper management to get our moral up. A initial benchmark survey was done, it was bad. They start putting on free pizzas and internal puff pieces on our homepage about how great they are to work for.  Connecting with the average worker about what they are doing for summer holidays etc. \nNote: Working your ass off and VPs telling you about their holidays on a private beach of some exclusive tropical island, does not bring you together as one big team. \n\nThey tried, it failed, but upper management felt they made a little positive change in the culture, but knew it was nowhere near the targets they set. They were trying to get an Enron (post closure) culture to an Apple level. \n\nWell remember how I mentioned there have been times of gang buster growth. Well last two quarters we had a bubble. Pretty much everyone hit bonus and a lot of us did really well according to sales reporting. \n\nWhen the company realised the end of FY payouts were going be be HUGE they changed it up (surprise surprise). Managers had started talking about potential end of year results etc and nobody had any more reviews before end of year. We were all pretty happy. \n\nBut that’s not why we are here.\n\nThe company that originally ran the benchmark survey was asked to run the 200 multi choice survey again. This company was used for results privacy and survey results integrity. \n\nA few days before the survey was sent, an email stating that “We are on a journey to come together as one family to do right by our customers, community and shareholders. [some crap about focusing on the next set of goals etc]... the only formula to succeed is to do this together. If we aren’t engaged as a team, we will never deliver quality service for our customers.”\n\nWithout us knowing, an update was slipped into our bonus conditions page on the companies homepage noting the survey results will apply a bonus multiplier depending survey result to target. As mentioned earlier, the target was high. \n\nEg. For a low morale to target score, a 20k sales bonus x 0.5 multiplier = an actual bonus of $10k. A positive score multiplier of 1.5 would result in a 30k bonus. \n\nNobody caught wind of it. Until one woman in another sales division who wanted to double check her bonus found it. \n\nThis is where the malicious compliance hit. Instead of raising this to management as being unfair, word of mouth about the multiplier spread with instructions. People started posting positive things on the homepage and slipping in how the multiplier is great to keep us honest, and we might not get there yet, but we need long term goals etc. Literally hundreds of these types of messages from sales teams, they flooded the homepage. \n\nNext came the survey to fill out...\n\nThat year, our sales divisions were more engaged than any other company on the planet. According to our survey results, Apple and Google looked the slave labour for morale and engagement. \n\nOur bonuses all went up by 25% to what we were expecting. Company couldn’t pull the multiplier as there was so much positive attention to it on the homepage. \n\nThe bonus should have been waaay higher, but IT, marketing, admins, risk, finance etc didn’t have a sales bonus it was multiplied by. So they submitted what everyone in sales felt as it had no impact on them. \n\nSo glad I am on in finance anymore.  Not sure if this was revenge or malicious compliance, but damn it was fun. ",

One was this guy who bought two adjacent houses with the intention of making them into one.\n\nBoth houses had separate council tax accounts which needed to be merged into one. So the guy calls the council and pays the balance on both accounts. He then cancels one account, then changes the other so that it covers the whole building.\n\nA month after doing this, the guy gets two bills; one for the new account that covers the whole building, and one for the old account that was cancelled, which states that he owes £1.68. He calls them to ask about it. They tell him that their office takes 24 hours to process the account closure, so the £1.68 represents a single day of tax that was accumulated before the closure was completed.\n\nThe guy asks if this could just be waivered, since he's technically already paying for that period through the other tax code. Council tells him \"No, absolutely no discretion can be given with any transaction.\"\n\nSo the guy does some research, and somehow finds out that under UK law, if this account still has funds in it, the council have to keep it open for 100 years, even if the property it relates to no longer exists.\n\nSo he calls them back to tell them that he's sending them a cheque for £2.68, and for the next 100 years they have to send him an annual statement telling him that his account is £1 in credit.\n\nCoincidentally, the person on the other end of the phone had suddenly found some spare discretion, and was able to waive the charge.",

They were on the nicer side of town, and had just got done hiking at a local park, so they were kinda sweaty and gross. My dad also has this big, wildly bushy beard, which doesn't help him look any less funky.\n\nEither way, they order, and both of them get a pretty large order with drinks and such, and their total comes out to $30 something. I can't remember exactly why, but he only has a $100 bill on him, not including his credit and debit cards. \n\nNow this was pretty soon after they changed the look of the $100 bill, and both the new ones and the old ones were in circulation. More often than not, you'd see the new ones, but the old bills popped up from time to time.\n\nSo he hands the cashier (C, for reference) the bill, and their conversation goes something like this after he \"holds it to the light\":\n\nC: I'm sorry sir, but I believe this bill is counterfeit. I'm going to have to confiscate it.\n\nDad: No that's okay, give me the bill and I'll pay with my card.\n\nC: I can't do that sir, it's company policy for us to keep counterfeit bills. It's to keep them out of circulation in other businesses.\n\nDad: That's bullshit, give me my money back.\n\nC: If you keep this up, I'm calling the police and they can handle this.\n\nDad: You know what? Call the police. I want them here now.\n\nBy this point, there are several people in line behind them, complaining about what's taking so long, etc. The police are called, and they wait another 15 minutes or so for them to get to the WingStop. They aren't taking any other orders or being remotely productive at all. My dad is getting visibly mire irritated by the minute. Finally, the police (P) arrive.\n\nP: So, what's the issue here?\n\nC: This man is trying to pay with fake money.\n\nDad: Um, no, I'm trying to pay with my $100 bill and this cashier is trying to steal from me. Told them I'd pay with my card if they would just give the bill back, they said that it was \"company policy\" to keep counterfeit bills. \n\nP (to C): Did you check it?\n\nC: Of COURSE I checked it, I held it to the light and the bar wasn't there.\n\nThe police man is noticeably irritated as well at this point, snatches the bill and checks it with his fancy pen. The bill \"passes the test,\" and the cashier pales as they realize they've been caught.\n\nP: So what you're trying to tell me is that you wanted to steal from this man? Give the man his money back and stop harassing people.\n\nThe cashier takes the bill from the police officer and shamefully hands it back to my dad. The cashier, who is— SUPRISE!— the manager, offers my dad his lunch on the house, and a gift card. My dad refuses, and they go to the McDonald's across the street.\n\nMy dad (and the rest of our family, surprisingly) has not been to another WingStop since. ",

We have IT consultants who act as network admins and do most of the heavy lifting. \n\nThere's a guy, we'll just call him douche, cause he's a douche. anyway, Douche accidentally deletes a file he's been working on. before we go too far, Douche technically works for a different company, and doesn't have a single iota of authority over me. I basically answer directly to the CEO. So he comes to me, Friday, at 4:53 and tells me he deleted the file and he needs it back. He then proceeds to tell me that I'm not allowed to go home until this is taken care of. Now see... If you would have just not been a douche, you probably would have had the file back in about 5 minutes, but you had to go and be a douche. Oh well. \n\nI'm a little jammed on this day with something I'm working on, so I decided to work a little bit of over time. Nothing crazy, just 15 minutes. And so at 5:14, I email the offsite IT guys to restore the file, since they're the only ones who can do that. \\(But they've now been gone for 14 minutes.\\) I've now taken care of everything I can do on my end, so as far as I'm concerned, I've met my criteria and I'm headed home. It was a 3 day weekend but Douche had scheduled his crew to come in and work on Monday. But the IT guys were out until Tuesday. On Tuesday AM, I got an email that the file had been restored and I forwarded it over to Douche. \n\nCome on man. Just don't be a douche; your life would probably be much more pleasant, and you'd get your files restored faster. ",

Brilliant engineer/crazy person. Because Nathan likes rules and Nathan doesn't give up when he knows how things *should* work. I like to get him to tell the story whenever we're together because he doesn't even see why its funny - it's just how he deals with all problems. \n\nNathan was like if you saw Sysiphus and you thought, maybe I should try to stop him. But then one day, the boulder was on top of the hill. And you go and ask Sysiphus how he did it and he replied, \"it was simple... I just kept pushing it forever and ever, and eventually... the mountain gave up.\" A real Grade 19 Bureaucrat. He just works systems through problems no matter how daunting they should seem.\n\n***\n\nUntil one day, when Nathan's unstoppable force met an immovable object. I came into work and saw checks and envelopes spread all over his desk. And Nathan filling them out with the kind of grin Steve Buscemi might have crossing names off a list with a tube of lipstick.\n\nI ask him about it and he calmly starts explaining that he's \"having trouble with the IRS.\" I probe a little deeper since that in no way explains more than one check or envelope and he starts telling me about how last year during tax season he was in China for work so he started filling his taxes out early while at his parents' house. He owed a little but left before he could mail it in. But he remembered while in China and (broke through the firewall in order to) paid it online. But then his parents, thinking he forget, wrote a check for him and mailed his taxes in too. So now his taxes would be paid twice. So they said don't worry about it, we'll cancel the check.\n\nWell, it turns out that NYS IRS has a cancelled check fee of something like $40. And they sent Nathan a bill and penalty for the $40... That was it. That was the whole story. A $40 fee.\n\nNathan, why do you have 20 checks on your desk? \"Oh, well after I explained to them what was wrong with the fee they didn't get it.\" So Nathan spent the next 4 weeks escalating the issue to the point that he got a case officer - a real, live human agent on the phone with a case number. Nathan started by asking for the agent to spell his name - and politely to demonstrate that he was where he said he was by asking how the weather was and how the \"drive in\" had been that day. He then asked for his agent's manager - got their name and exchanged some pleasantries.\n\nHe explained that his parents wrote the check but that he was the one being charged the fee. The agent explained that this was the policy of the IRS - \"All cancelled checks will result in a $40 fee\". The agent and Nathan went in rigorously compliant circles for hours exploring the rules. Nathan then calmly confirmed that:\n\n1. It is the policy of the IRS to allow just anyone to write a check on behalf of anyone else - *\"yes sir that is fine. You just need to indicate the name and zip code of the account.\"*\n2.  It is the policy of the IRS to charge a $40 cancellation fee to the person whose account is indicated on the check. - *\"yes sir, that is the policy in NYS\".*\n\nThis means that - *and I swear to God he actually asked the agent this hypothetical on the phone* - \"I (Nathan) could write a $10 check and indicate it's for you (Mr. \"Agent\" at 1234567 Schenectady, NY) and cancel it resulting in a $40 fee for you with absolutely no penalty or recourse to me?\" - The equally compliant and rule-minded agent replied, \"Yes sir, I guess you could.\"\n\nSo, that's what Nathan did. \nAnd that's what was doing with 20 checks on his desk and what he meant by \"IRS trouble\". He was following through... sending checks to the IRS addressed to pay the taxes of the agent and the agent's manager - so Nathan could cancel them, causing the agent and his manager to owe the IRS a fee for each cancelled check. He was exploiting the same flaw in the system in which he was caught to essentially *extort* the IRS agents.\n\nI laughed about this for weeks after... \n\nAnd then... 3 or so weeks later... I'll be damned if he didn't receive a letter from the IRS:\n\n&gt; \"Sir, we understand the point you've made. Please consider your fee waived and I hope we can put this behind us.\"\n\nTL;DR:\nMy Co-Worker got the IRS to reverse a fee because he found a way to use a loophole to force the IRS Agent to have to pay the fee too.",

He starts the claim through his insurance and they start the repairs. The insurance adjuster writes into the repair report that the insurance company put a lifetime guarantee on all repairs done to the car from this accident. Things that were repaired/replaced included the transmission, the condenser, the radiator, serpentine belt, headlights assembly, ECU, etc. Basically, a lot of big ticket items. \n\nSo time wears on, and about three years later the clutch padneeds to be replaced so my dad takes it into the shop and then sends the insurance company through bill. \n\nInsurance agent: why are you sending this to us?\n\nDad: it's one of the things repaired after the accident that you guaranteed for life.\n\nInsurance company: we didn't mean lifetime, we meant a year.\n\nDad: well, the policy says lifetime so you're on the hook.\n\nAfter a few nasty grams between lawyers, the insurance company pays up. But now, my parents are pissed at the way they've been treated so they resolve to keep the car until the floorboards rust out.\n\nThings that have been replaced on the insurance company dime since then: clutch, radio, left front tire (multiple times), brake pads and rotors, front bumper, driver door window motor, air filter, left side engine mounts, etc.\n\nThe insurance company tried to buy them out a few years ago but my parents refused, and since no limitations were put on the repair policy, the insurance company is on the hook for as long as my parents own the car. It's a manual diesel so it's going to live forever.\n\nCurrent mileage target: 500k",

What better way to earn some cash for the holidays than a temp package handler?  I wasn’t doing anything better.\n\nDuring this time in the late 90s, we would leave budget rental trucks at locations that could ship for us. This way, all we had to do is go pick up the truck and take it to our main facility to be offloaded.  It was a cake job and I got paid pretty well. \n\nOne night, we get to a store that sells our shipping services. A man was arguing with a store clerk about the size of his package. My buddy and I ask whats up and the clerk tells us the package dimensional weight is too big (dimensional weight is used to calculate how much space the package will take up on a truck/plane).   Oh, it also may not fit through the conveyor belt system at the main facility.\n\nAnyway we remeasure and confirm its too big. And the packaging was some cardboard boxes cut up and taped around this large rectangle item.   The guy goes bizerk and demands that we take his item or he’ll make sure we are fired. \n\nFinally, we decide its not worth the argument and agree to take it and take the chance. We ask if it had insurance on on it and the man said,  “this is basically indestructible, so the $100 you give is ok. “ We take the package. \n\nAbout 3 days later my boss calls us on the radio and ask us what we know about this item. We tell the story and ask why.  Our boss told us the belt system destroyed the item beyond repair. \n\nHe then tells us that it was a Dodge Viper carbon fiber T-top and was worth about $5000.  He really should have paid for the insurance.  I never heard anything else about it. ",

        "text": "In my youth I worked for a fast food chain. In this chain standard protocol for putting sauce on a burger was to put what looked like a stop symbol (🚫) on the top bun. I also had a shift manager who was a complete arsehole that hated my guts, and once tried to tell the store manager that I was dealing drugs on the side, but that’s a story for another time.\n\nOne day this lanky gentlemen walks in during peak period. My shift manager is incredibly lazy so he’s on the work computer while I’m cooking and doing the register while our driver is on delivery. Lankmeister McMayoface (let’s call him LM for short) asks for extra mayo on his burger. \n\nNot a worry, just put the little stop sign on the top and bottom of the burger, as per the standard. \n\nI make it for him, hand it to him, hit him with that “have a great day sir, enjoy your meal” and go back to serving and cooking.\n\nA few minutes later LM walks back in and goes up to the counter, burger half eaten. “Hi, I asked for extra mayo and there isn’t enough on this burger, could you remake it?” This burger has been well eaten, but fuck it, he asked me nicely (which is rare) and I’m being paid minimum wage. \n\nI remake his burger, but I smother it with mayo, I even show him and he says it looks like enough. He leaves, I continue serving customers.\n\nLM storms back into the shop full of customers and he’s fuming. He marches up to the counter, slaps the burger down (there’s about a quarter of it left) and yells “are you fucking deaf? Are you fucking thick? I asked you twice for extra mayo! There’s no mayo!” I immediately realise it’s a scam and am about to tell him there’s nothing more I can do when my shift manager makes a miraculous appearance. After LM explains that he wanted extra mayo and that I wasn’t giving it to him,  my boss chews me out in front of the customers and reminds me that the protocol for extra mayo is on the top and the bottom. He goes and makes him the burger that I made originally (just 2 lame little stop signs) and I don’t bother trying to tell him that’s what I already did. Hey, he must be right since it’s the company policy, something I definitely was not following in the first place. He tells me from now on I gotta stick to the rules. I agree, hand LM his burger, hit him with the “have a great day sir, enjoy your meal” and a cheeky little “see you soon!” just for me.\n\nLM is pissed when he gets back in the shop. He stands on a table and screams that we’re fucking con artists. That we are just stupid high school drop outs that can’t follow simple fucking instructions. Tells us his autistic 4 year old can make better burgers. Asks us if we even know what mayo is. He doesn’t even have the burger this time, I make him another, but this time, the burger is dripping with in mayo. \n\n”Put it in a cup if you have to!” I get out a small gravy cup and fill it with mayo, at his request (apparently a large gravy cup is ridiculous, and that by suggesting it I’m just mocking him)\n\nI put the gravy container full of mayo on the counter but before LM can take it, I slap my hand on the container. I turn my head to the manager and say “sorry sir but for this much mayo it’s protocol for me to charge $2” he is extremely pissed off. Says that we made 3 garbage burgers and that he should get the mayo for free. \n\nMe: “Didn’t stop you from eating them, though”\n\nLM: “You were just going to throw them out anyway.”\n\nMe: “Sorry sir, but the only way for you to avoid this charge is if I put it straight on your burger, I can’t give you so much extra mayo on the side”\n\nLM: “Do it then. Put the mayo on the burger”\n\nMe: “Are you sure?”\n\nLM: “Of course I’m fucking sure, just do it!”\n\nI ruined his burger, it was the most disgusting thing you’ve ever seen. The bun was mayo, the chicken might as well have been mayo, there was mayo between every ingredient. It was basically a small pile of mayo. He gave us a scathing review and called up the head office of the franchise to complain (and to try and score some freebies, I’m sure). They came down, reviewed the footage and took witness statements. They berated me briefly for being “too lenient” and banned that guy from visiting any of the franchise restaurants in the country.\n\n(TL;DR gave the man extra mayo and got him banned from every fast food restaurant (of that type) in the country).",

Usually I just stay in my room to avoid her because there’s not a confrontational bone in my body, but she still finds nice little ways to make life miserable. We’ll call her N.\n\nN has always enjoyed fun roommate activities like not doing dishes for months at a time (I was blamed for every dish so I switched to disposable plates, haven’t used actual cutlery in months so it’s all her), smoking weed in the house almost every day, never paying bills on time then getting mad at us for “pestering her” about them, and getting mad at pretty much anything else we do.\n\nNow for a little backstory, N has 2 huge German Shepherds who are loud, aggressive, and stay in the backyard almost every night while she’s out partying. Our neighbors have a young kid who is woken up by the loud barking, so we’ve had the cops called on us 4 times already for noise complaints from. I also have a dog (border collie) but she stays in my room for most of the day bc I’m only ever gone for a few hours at a time. The last time the cops were called I was home and the officer let it go with a warning but said next time there will be a ticket.\n\nFast forward 2 months, N is dog sitting for a friend (we now have 5 big dogs in our tiny house) and these dogs are even more barky, which only riles up her 2 even more. She’s left them outside for the past 2 night when she goes to bed and they sit outside my window howling their asses off until 3 am until I finally let them in out of fear for a ticket. Finally I’ve had enough, so I let the dogs in again and politely ask they be kept inside overnight bc we’re going to get a ticket... and she LOSES IT.\n\nShe fires back a two paragraph text about how it’s somehow my fault, that my dog barks 24 hours a day anyway (not true), that I need to immediately let them back outside and she isn’t worried about cops.\n\nHa, ok.\n\nLike any good roommate would, I release the hellhounds into the backyard and they immediately go apeshit, then I grab my purse and book it out if there to stay w a friend for the night. Came back the next day and - surprise! - the neighbors called the cops and N received a BEAUTIFUL $350 citation. \n\nShe’s pissed, it feels so good.\n\nI hope she moves out.\n\nTL;DR- Roommate’s dogs get the cops called for noise, she gets more dogs. Tried to warn her about ticket potential, doesn’t listen, I let them bark it up and get her a citation.",

        "text": "Let me start this by saying this isn't something where someone lost thousands of dollars or anything like that, this is small time, but it made me happy so might as well spread the joy!\n\nI work for a labour company that hires me out to other companies, hepling out with pretty basic construction stuff. (Painting, carpeting, etc). Anyway, the foreman asked to borrow my scissors, and when I told him I don't have scissors he was annoyed, insisting I needed scissors to do my job. (I don't). The manager then told me to go buy a pair of scissors from a nearby store, and to give the receipt to some guy in charge of finance so that I can get the cost back.\n\nSo that's what I do. I go for a nice walk (a good break from work), buy the scissors, and return the receipt to the finance guy that looks at me incredulously. \"Five dollars, really? If I show this to the boss he's just going to be annoyed. Next time come to me first and I'll lend you my credit card\" I'm slightly miffed, sure it's five bucks, but it's the principal. He hands back the receipt and the scissors, and says they're mine to keep. \n\nI tell the manager and he says just add the extra cost to my hours if you know what I mean. (If I get paid $15 an hour add 20 minutes). This is where the malicious compliance comes in! I do just that, adding a few minutes to my timesheet. This means I am paid an extra $5, *but* because I'm hired by a labour company, I'm only paid minimum wage, while the company I work for is paid almost the same again for each hour I work. Because of this, while I still receive $5, the place I'm currently working pays twice that!\n\nSo in conclusion, the company that hires me out pays $10 bucks and gives me a free pair of scissors, when if handled properly they would have paid $5 and kept the scissors.

        "text": "I am not sure this is malicious compliance or not, but it was one of my finer moments and I feel the need to share it! Some five or six years ago...\n\nMy wife’s grandmother passed and left us her home in her will. The house was rather large, but had been built some time in the 1960s and needed updating. We decided to basically gut the home and do a full remodel. \n\nFirst thing was to talk to my insurance guy and see what I needed to do with the insurance. He comes out and explains that I need to do a fire policy, which basically will replace the structure in the event of a major catastrophe. Cool, insurance in place I start remodeling. \n\nFast forward seven or eight months and I am done, and so bone tired and mad at the world that my reflection in the mirror tried to avoid me. I was working a rotating shift (days, evenings, midnights) and spending every waking moment working on this house. Five hours a day/night was the most sleep I was getting. I would snap at the wind for blowing I was so strung out. Que the insurance guy and his antics...\n\nWhile I was sleeping after working midnight shift, my wife has IG (insurance guy) come to look at the house and change the policy back to full coverage. When I wake up for my next shift, she informs me that we have to put a new roof on before he can change the policy. I almost came unglued. I had ripped the ceilings out of this house, so if there had been a roof leak, I am pretty sure I would have found it. Luckily this was Friday evening, so I had the entire weekend to calm down and plot my next move. \n\nI called first thing  Monday morning and set up an appointment for 8 a.m. Tuesday at the house, and explained to him I was on midnights and to please make sure he was there by 8 a.m. No particular reason, I just hoped it would discomfort him having to be somewhere else that early in the morning (a dick move mostly). Tuesday morning rolls around, and he shows up with his boss. At first this threw me off, but I figure what the hell, two birds, one rock and stuff. \n\nMe: IG, hows it going?\n\nIG: Pretty good, how are you?\n\nMe: Tired. How bout you show me exactly what is wrong with this roof so we can get going?\n\nIG: Sure thing, step right over here. You see that shingle?\n\nMe: Ya.\n\nIG: See how bad a shape it’s in?\n\nMe: Sure do! (thinking to myself, “hell no, what the fuck are you looking at?”)\n\nIG: And over there see that place?\n\nMe: Yup, gotta bad spot or two there also!\n\nIG: This roof has taken some serious storm damage, it is in rough shape!\n\nWe proceed all the way around the house with him pointing at random spots, as far as I could tell, and saying things like “That shingle is shot. Those too. Ya, and right here.” The whole time I just did like a chicken pecking and affirmed him with “Yup! You’re right” All the while his boss is saying nothing. \n\nAfter he is finished pointing out all of these bad places,\n\nIG: So see, you will have to replace that roof before we can cover it. \n\nMe: Your right, I had been so busy on the inside I hadn’t paid much attention. So, can you file the claim for me, or do I need to go talk to one of the ladies down at the office?\n\nIG: CLAIM??!! What do you mean a claim!!???\n\nMe: Well, best I can figure it was those bad storms back in April that did all this damage, and y’all were covering it through my GMIL’s policy, so I reckon y’all would be who I s’posed to talk to right? \n \n(I like turning the backwoods country accent up to 11 when dealing with people who think they are smarter than me, adds flavor to the humble pie for them)\n\nIG: Well now, hold on. \n\nMe: Naw, you’re a hunnerd percent right. It’s took some serious storm damage, and we ain’t had none since that bout back in April. Now, I put the fire policy on in July, so any damage done woulda fell back on the old policy. \n\nIG: ......(standing there sucking air like it’s gonna run out)\n\nIG’s boss: He’s right. And since they have a year to file that claim, we will have to do it. Get the paperwork started and let me know if you need help.\n\n\n\nI am no roof expert, the roof could have been shot all to hell for all I know. It looked good, and didn’t leak. After I explained to the adjuster what the whole deal was about, he found enough other stuff wrong so that I wasn’t out one nickel on an entire new roof!\n\nTLDR: Insurance guy decided to be a jack wagon for some reason, and I got a free roof out of the deal!\n\n\nEdit: A few points to help clear things up some. \n\nMy wife was executor of the estate, and had a POA for the deceased. \n\nI referenced the storms in April because that year there were multiple bad hail storms that came through. Car dealerships lost entire inventories from these storms. It was an insurance nightmare all year long, which was why nothing was really questioned. The rest of that year was fairly calm weather wise, so it was most likely the event that “destroyed” the roof. \n\nThe roof was about 5 years old give or take. Wear and tear wasn’t a concern, and the insurance company had held the policy on the house since forever and were familiar with it. \n\nIG was wanting me to pay for the roof out of my pocket. If this had been pointed out in July when I had the policy changed originally it would not have irritated me as much. After spending the entire summer and fall working on the house and him popping up with “Oh yeah by the way”, yes it rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nI am a hick, bumpkin, and some of the other names mentioned. I love that people automatically shave 30 points off of my IQ for talking the way I do (insert jokes about my now negative IQ here please). It gives me a distinct advantage when someone does this. Yes I play it up for my own amusement/benefit. It is no different than a woman using her looks, a policeman using his badge, or any of the other advantages people use daily. \n\nI do not type in my southern accent all the time because it isn’t easy. It’s almost like making a language up as you go, and if it is that hard for me to type, I can only imagine what someone who is unfamiliar with the vernacular would go through reading it. I would imagine there would be migraines and brain scans involved before they got to the end of the post. \n\n",

I was always the type of worker that had zero problems helping a customer, not in my section, sure thing let me show you exactly where it is or spend time helping them figure out exactly what they needed for a project. I like helping people. But some people can still be crappy.\n\nMy work had an item in my section on a really good sale for a week. It sold out completely during that week. So two hours before we close on the last day of this week long sale an older gentleman with a real nasty attitude comes up to me and wants to know where the product is at. I walk over with him and show him where it should be at and see we have none. Okay, I say i can scan it in and see if there are any in stock that just are not on the shelf. My section has lots of big items and this was one so we didn't really keep backstock but whatever, despite his nasty attitude I still want to help him. Scanning it rings up that there are none in stock just like I expected. I tell him I am really sorry we are sold out of them right now. He immediately starts yelling at me about how crooked we are to advertise for products that we dont carry just to trick people into coming into the store and how I am a terrible person for helping with this scam. I told him I can do a rain check for him so we will hold however many he wants when they come back in and give him the sale price but he is having none of it. He is still yelling at me about it being a scam and that another one of our stores that is about 30 minutes away would never treat a customer like we do. Finally he says forget it, I am just going to the other store to get the product like I should have in the first place. I look down at the scanner that also includes stock numbers for the couple closest stores, including the one this man is now planning to go to, and they are all also out of stock. I just told the man i was really sorry I couldn't help him and hopefully the other store would be able to and to have a wonderful evening and turned around and went right back to work and let him make the drive.",

        "text": "When I was a teenager, my friends and I used to hang out at the local theater on weekends because we were still counting down to being old enough to drink in public. In fact, everyone who went to the three nearest high schools all hung out at the theater on weekends with their preferred groups.  \n\nThough every era-appropriate subgenre of suburban 90s teens was represented on any given weekend night, the punk rock enthusiasts stood out from the rest. It is important to note that this distinction had nothing to do with our behavior--we were no more rambunctious than some other groups, but as far as appearance went, we looked like the extras from _The Road Warrior_ enjoying a perpetual smoke break.\n\nFor my part, in addition to a green bihawk, I had an old military jacket that I had dyed black and covered in spikes, studs, and band patches, the most prominent of which was a giant back patch that had been cut from an old t-shirt. It depicted an emaciated, skeletal humanoid with a Mohawk vomiting blood into a pile of dead babies. \n\nThis period of my life is as close as I will likely come to understanding even a little bit what it feels like to be discriminated against based on my appearance. People in the Georgia suburbs generally reacted to my presence with suspicion, fear, and distrust wherever I went, and I reveled in it when it suited me. In a few years, I would learn that I could take off the jacket, along with the baggage that went with it, but as far as this story goes, we definitely aren’t there yet. \n\nAnyway, it was on a night like any other that the cop that patrolled the theater approached our group with definite purpose. D, one of my younger friends, had already started to get up. We knew the drill.\n\nEven then, I had mixed feelings about law enforcement officers. In my experience, some of them did heroic work that saved lives, some of them took bribes to look the other way, and some of them singled out any difference and punished it any way they could, just like any bully would.\n\n“D, sit down,” I quietly but firmly commanded. If the cop saw this, he gave no indication. \n\nThe cop said, “You boys need to leave.”\n\nD started to get up again.\n\n“D, sit down,” I said again.\n\nD sat back down slowly, perhaps realizing that he was now at the edge of something, not in the middle.\n\n“You heard me, right? You need to leave.”\n\n“Oh? Why is that?”\n\n“Because you are loitering,” the cop said, exasperated at being challenged.\n\nThen I did what was either the most or least punk rock thing I've ever done:\n\nI looked up at him and said, \"Actually, according to Georgia Municipal Code section 16-11-36, loitering consists of acting in an evasive manner in the presence of law enforcement, refusing to identify ourselves, or manifestly endeavoring to conceal ourselves or an object.”\n\nHe looked at me like I just came down from outer space to swindle his mom out of her retirement fund. I continued:\n\n“Now you’re supposed to give us a reasonable opportunity to identify ourselves and explain or justify our presence and behavior.\"\n\nIf it strains credibility to imagine a 17 year old saying that to a cop, I understand completely. I should mention, though, that we had been getting sent home early almost every weekend for almost a year by the same cop, while all of the other teens, from AC to Zack, were allowed to play out their curfews. \n\nAt one point, the word went around my group of friends that the charge of loitering was specifically related to taking up commercial space without actively consuming anything, so we had adopted the habit of making sure we each had at least one dollar on us at all times to demonstrate our status as potential paying customers. \n\nThis theory, unfortunately, broke down in practice: One night, upon being confronted by the cop, we attempted to present our dollars, but instead of hissing and vanishing like a Marxist vampire, he laughed at us and told us we needed to “learn more about the law.”\n\nThusly inspired to a new level of civic participation, I spent the rest of the night memorizing the relevant municipal ordinances pertaining to loitering for the next time the police confronted us, and I even practiced saying them out loud a few times. \n\nBut I digress. \n\nThe cop, having just been prompted to give us an opportunity to explain or justify our presence and behavior simply gave me a long, hard look and said, \"Are you a lawyer? Because I love throwing lawyers in jail.\"\n\nI gave him a long, hard look and said, \"No, I'm not _actually_ a lawyer, but this jacket fools everyone.\"\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something, but instead just gulped a few times like a landed fish. The realization that he wasn’t psychologically prepared to turn a routine troublemaker sweep into an actual incident crossed his face, and he went back inside the theater.  \n\nHe never bothered us again.\n\nTL;DR: A cop suggested I learn the law, so I came back to tutor him.\n\n",

        "text": "I hope this qualifies as MC. A few years ago, I was assigned to go on a work trip with two other coworkers to one of our sites that's about 4 hours away. We were doing our Windows 7 upgrade, that site kept getting delayed because they moved and so our trip kept getting delayed because of the schedule of the other upgrades.\n\nIt was me, my coworker (CW), and a networking guy (NG) going on the 3-day trip. NG had moved on from our team but used to handle all of our remote sites and knew them like the back of his hand. He was passing the knowledge onto us and the rest of our team on how to handle these situations.\n\nCW heard from NG through the grapevine that the trip had been delayed from the summer date we had planned until it was postponed for fall break (and then eventually winter break). However, we didn't hear word from our manager on it and as far as we knew, it was still happening over the summer. She was terrible at communicating and we frequently had to follow up with her multiple times on issues that we couldn't take care of. We got tired of asking her about every little thing and decided to play dumb.\n\nThe day before the scheduled date of the trip, our manager sends an email at 3:30 telling us the trip has been postponed. I'm still in the office so now I'm officially aware. CW leaves at 3 and is an hourly employee, therefore he wouldn't be checking his email after hours. He had already devised his plan for tomorrow.\n\nThe next day he comes into the office in sweatpants and a tee, holding his travel bag with some clothes in it to look believable. He comes in at his normal time, has to wait 2 hours for our manager comes in, and sees her official email about that day. When she comes in, he puts on the act:\n\n&gt;CW: So when were you going to tell us about the trip?\n\n&gt;M: I thought you'd see the email and kind of already knew since we haven't discussed more details of the trip.\n\n&gt;CW: I'm an hourly employee, I'm not supposed to check email outside of work. I figured we would just ride along and NG would give us the details on the way there. I had to make plans for this trip, I even had my dog boarded.\n\n&gt;M: Oh wow, I'm so sorry. It won't happen again.\n\nThe lack of communication thing? It did happen again from her, many times. I just sat at my cubicle listening to the whole thing, stifling laughter. There wasn't much aftermath to it, other than CW not going on the trip when he transferred to networking with NG.",

        "text": "Hello, this is my first post here.\n\nI work at a car rental so my job is to have customers sign the forms and give them the car they rented. \n\nWe also have a clubmember discount (this is important later).  Everyone can be a clubmember and it basically means that we put your details in the system so we can fill out the forms more quickly and as an added bonus your own risk on the car is lowered. Normally if you have an accident or hit a pole or scratch the car you have to pay anywhere between 600 and 1250 depending on the car. Club members pay 150-350€. \n\nKeep in mind being a clubmember is 100% free no extra charges just some nice discounts and we can help you quicker.\n\nWell, meet the bitchy lady. Because I was in the garage helping another customer she had to wait 5 minutes which was absolutely unacceptable of course. Me explaining her nicely that I was alone in the store at the moment and that the customer before here just need some extra explanation about the car.\n\nBL: Just give me the car keys so I can go.\n\nME: Sure, just sign here for the invoice and since you are a clubmember we already have all your personal details.\n\nBL: Okay, looks at the receipt. Why is my own risk lowered to 350?\n\nME: I calmly explain here this is because she is a clubmember and it's a free bonus. It doesn't cost anything and will only save her money.\n\nBL: I don't want my own risk lowered just remove it.\n\nME: It won't give you any discount, we lower it for free for returning customers. \n\nBL: Listen up, you remove it from the receipt because I don't want it.\n\nME: Shrugging, okay if that is what you want. I'll just change it in the system real quick and voila your own risk is now 1250€ instead of 350 and you still pay the same rate.\n\nBL: Happily signs the required forms and I give her the car keys and she goes on her way.\n\n\nFast forward 2 days later she returns the car and there is a huge dent + scratch on the front side of the car.\n\nSo I explain her that she will have to pay for that and that it will.... ( Yeah, you guessed it) 1250€! The bitching lady completely loses it and tells me she is a clubmember and that she has reduced risk. I calmly explain to her that she didn't want the lowered risk. \n\nShe asks for the manager and starts bitching against him. The manager completely takes my side because he already knew the full story. And the bitching lady had to pay up the full 1250€.\n\nTLDR: Customer at a car rental didn't want free lowering of her own risk in case of accidents and scratches. She had to pay 1250 euro instead of 350 cause she fcked up the car.\n\nEdit1: thanks Reddit this post is now 50% of my karma!\n\n\n\n",

As a grew bigger and bigger it was a challenge  but it started to be a total nightmare, while getting into my third trimester also summer was approaching and it was going to get hotter and hotter. So I approached my chef (usually a nice guy)and asked him to move me to the cold area for  the rest of my pregnancy as blah, blah, blah, me bigger, baby hot in the belly blah, blah, blah. I honestly thought it wasn't a big deal as he was hiring new people for a busy summer anyway but he said let me ask HR\n\nI was a little bit disappointed but I was determined not to finish all the way so I planed to go on mat leave just earlier in case they wouldn't accommodate me. \n\nAfter 2 weeks of waiting on their decision they asked me to have my doctor to filled out a form, so I went to my doctor I asked her to please restrict me because my job was mostly physical.  She told me to tell her what exactly  I wanted, so I took my note with my restrictions which included to work up to 6 hours a day.\n\nAfter another week of waiting, one day they called me into a conference room with my two chefs, HR, an HR assistant and a union rep. I thought it was too odd but it turned out that my accommodation was something that came with my benefits and that working 6 hours a day put  me into sick leave benefits which made my insurance paid  80%of those 2 hours a day I was missing because of my medical restriction. \n\nMy chef wasn't happy cause it was busy season but I was willing to work the entire pregnancy if he was just nice enough to let me work across the kitchen were the windows were but he decided to be a meanie and involve HR.\n\n I am very sensitive and while pregnant I was even more so I took it bad when my chef wouldn't understand I was just a pregnant woman who couldn't move fast enough to work on a busy line.  So I ended up leaving earlier, almost 2 months before my due date and got paid sick leave through my insurance before my mat leave benefits. \n\n\n",

        "text": "This was about 10 years back in my ARMY days. \n\nSO, part of ARMY grunt life is waking up at 0500 every morning for physical training (PT). My platoon would practice combatives(hand-to-hand) for PT at least twice a week, as it is a pretty intense workout, and keeps that skill set sharp.\nNow our company commander (we'll call him Cpt. Tryhard) was a 6ft 3in 250lbs+ corn fed midwestern guy, always with a dip, a swagger, and a 'pompous hard-ass' attitude that officers tend to develop as they grow in rank. He was genuinely a pretty decent guy, but it was important to him to look good (ie bad-ass) in front of the junior enlisted, and it was pretty obvious most of the time.\n\nBy contrast, I had a very close friend (we'll call him Jim), who is all of 5ft 9in, ~130lbs soaking wet. Jim is also one of the wiriest, scrappiest, most hate filled little bastards to ever walk the earth, which is why we were good friends. (you can probably tell where this is going)\n\nNormally, every platoon is given free reign on their PT choices, and they do PT together, just the platoon. Occasionally, one of the brass will feel like making an appearance for morale, get an itch to do some 'real' PT, or just want to show off in front of the junior enlisted. (enter Cpt. Tryhard)\n\nOne day we are setting up a circle to practice combatives for morning PT, when Cpt. Tryhard decides to join our morning session. We defer to him and set up for him to go first, and of course he spots Jim (easily the smallest guy in the platoon by a wide margin) and says 'I'll take private Jim over there.' At this point a few guys are whispering complaints, 'that's some bullshit' etc, and from the immediate reaction on his face, I can tell even my Sgt thinks this is shitty. But he just looks up with a subtle smirk and says 'alright Jim, you're up.' (there are no excuses, no 'unfair,' you just suck that shit up) So Jim steps up and we get ready for them to go at it.\n\nUsually in a training setting, the two guys will ease forward, feel each other out a bit, and lead into grappling and holds, and what generally amounts to a bunch of rolling around looking for a pin (no striking, that is separate training, and has a higher probability of injury). Well, Cpt. Tryhard decides to open with a full speed spear, because of course he would. Jim is caught off guard, shoulder right to the midsection, and is taken off his feet. However,  one of the downsides of spearing someone like that, is that it puts you into a textbook position to be guillotine choked, and sure enough, when Jim lands on his ass, we look, and he's got the Cpt. choking purple in a perfect guillotine. Maybe 5 seconds later the Cpt. is tapping out, all of us are purple with suppressed laughter, and the Cpt. quickly makes some excuse to be elsewhere. I saw him later on in the day, and during my salute in passing I innocently asked \"how did you enjoy PT with us this morning sir?\" I was met with a very muffled 'go fuck yourself' and half-assed salute as he sped along to his next destination.\n\nTL;DR - Giant corn fed Cpt decides to pick tiniest platoon member to practice combatives with, gets beat almost instantly, spends rest of the day (week, month, we laughed about that for awhile) pretty embarassed\n\nedit - some words, cause I'm not great at them  \n\nedit2: changed '5am in the morning' to '0500 every morning' because the Navy dislikes redundancy :p",

I reach out to our team that lets us move orders from one DC to another DC depending on cost and other details. I explain the situation, confirming the site I would like to handle these orders can handle them and they are aware. Here's the rough summary of the interactions:\n\nFirst Request - I have orders A and B, where combined 104 of the 200 cases are cutting, can you please source?\n\nFirst Response - We checked the order and there was only 40 cases cutting, no we won't source. 100 case minimum. \n\nSecond Request - Look at both orders please, combined they are 100 cases, which is your minimum. Source please\n\nSecond Response - It's two orders combining to the 100 cases, no we won't source.\n\nAt this point I'm frustrated, as by their definition of what is viable, I should be eligible for review for sourcing.\n\nI call my customer explain the situation to them.
