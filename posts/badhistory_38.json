        "text": "I'm shamelessly hopping on the \"lyrical bad history\" bandwagon. Billy Joel is probably one of the most celebrated songwriters of the 1970s and 80s, with hits like \"Piano Man,\" \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant,\" \"New York State of Mind,\" and many others. Joel released numerous songs with historical themes, such as \"Allentown,\" \"Goodnight Saigon,\" \"Leningrad,\" and most famously \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" which was frequently played in my freshman US History 1945-1989 class.\n\nThis post concerns a hit single from his 1973 album *Piano Man,* in which Joel sings a cowboy ballad about the famous outlaw [Billy the Kid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ASIT5DqN0)\n\n&gt;From a town known as Wheeling West Virginia\n\n&gt;Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand\n\n&gt;And his daring life of crime made him a legend in his time\n\n&gt;East and west of the Rio Grande\n\nRight away the song gets off on the wrong foot. Billy the Kid was born William Henry McCarty, Jr. sometime before the Civil War in New York City. His place of birth cannot be ascertained entirely due to a lack of records, but he most definitely did not hail from Wheeling, WV.\n\n&gt;Well he started with a bank in Colorado\n\n&gt;In the pocket of his vest a Colt he hid\n\n&gt;And his age and his size took the teller by surprise\n\n&gt;And the word spread of Billy the Kid\n\nBilly the Kid's career as an outlaw began when he stole some cheese in Silver City, NM at the age of fourteen. He escaped jail and became a fugitive. Despite his reputation, Billy the Kid never held up a bank in his entire career. His notoriety stemmed from his horse rustling along the Chisholm Trail and involvement with the Lincoln County range war. The cognomen \"the Kid\" came from obituaries and editorials written after his death and was likely not a contemporary nickname.\n\n&gt;One cold day a posse captured Billy\n\n&gt;And the judge said string him up for what he did\n\n&gt;And the cowboys and their kin\n\n&gt;Like the sea came pouring in to watch\n\n&gt;The hangin' of Billy the Kid\n\nBilly the Kid was never executed. He was killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett of Fort Sumner, NM. The exact circumstances of the altercation which resulted in his death are debated and detailed [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_the_Kid#Death), but he certainly never had a trial or hanging. Lew Wallace, the governor of New Mexico Territory, even considered granting a pardon to everyone involved in the Lincoln County Range War. It was this purported pardon which led Governor Bill Richardson to consider pardoning Billy the Kid posthumously in 2010 before deciding against it based on \"historical ambiguity.\"\n\nInterestingly, the song's inaccuracy was intentional. It was written to be a tall tale, with lyrics chosen based on how they sounded rather than their accuracy. Joel admitted in 1975 to *ZigZag* magazine, \n&gt;\"Basically it was an experiment with an impressionist type of lyric. It was historically totally inaccurate as a story, it wasn't supposed to be listened to as a story. I like writing more soundtrack type things, and I wanted to try something musical. I wrote that song all in one day – it was kind of a spoof on the rock-star type of thing.\"",

        "text": "The Irish War of Independence (and the subsequent conflicts) have produced a great many songs from the rebel perspective. Though interestingly enough there aren't many songs from the opposite perspective, and even fewer that have as their subject the Irish Civil War.\n\nI don't know why this is, but if I had to hazard a guess I'd say it's because most of the \"rebel\" songs about the Irish War of Independence were actually written long after the war was over, so they're looking back on the conflict and celebrating it and drawing parallels to the current conflict (and by current I mean whatever conflict was going on when the songs were written).\n\nSuch a song is \"Come Out Ye Black and Tans\", which purports to be about an IRA man in Dublin who would come home from the bar and call out his neighbors daring them to come fight him. \n\nIt's a rousing song that's incredibly easy to sing along with. My favorite version is by a group called The Irish Descendants (they're Canadian)\n\n[Come Out Ye Black and Tans](http://youtu.be/FCnGD6xv5ik)\n\nOf course it's full of historical inaccuracies.\n\n    I was born in a Dublin street\n    Where the loyal drums do beat,\n    And the loving English feet walked all over us;\n    And every single night when me dad would come home tight,\n    He'd invite the neighbours out with this chorus:\n\nChorus:\n\n    Come out you black and tans,\n    Come out and fight me like a man,\n    Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders;\n    Tell her how the IRA made you run like hell away,\n    From the green and lovely lanes of Killeshandra.\n\n    Come tell us how you slew\n    Them ol' Arabs two by two,\n    Like the Zulus they had knives and bows and arrows;\n    Of how bravely you faced one with your sixteen-pounder gun,\n    And you frightened all the natives to the marrow.\n\nChorus\n\n    Come let us hear you tell\n    How you slammed the brave Parnell,\n    And taught him well and truly persecuted;\n    Where are the stares and jeers that you proudly let us hear,\n    When our heroes of sixteen were executed.\n\nChorus\n\n    Oh! Come out you British Huns,\n    Come out and fight without your guns,\n    Show your wife how you won medals up in Derry;\n    You murdered sixteen men and you'll do the same again,\n    So get out of here and take your bloody army.\n\nChorus x2\n\nOn to the bad history!\n\n    I was born in a Dublin street\nTrue enough. The song was written by Dominic Behan, a famous Irish author/songwriter/poet who was born in Dublin\n\n    And every single night when me dad would come home tight,\n    He'd invite the neighbours out with this chorus\nHighly unlikely. Dominic would have needed to borrow Edward's time machine for this. Dominic was born in 1928. The events described in this song couldn't have happened after 1923.\n\n    Come out you black and tans\nThe Black and Tans were an auxiliary police force hired to help supplement the RIC and the British Army. They consisted of ex British soldiers who had fought in WWI. A complementary group was the Auxiliary Division which consisted of ex-British officers. The Auxiliary Division was supposed to focus on doing counter-insurgency work, and the Black and Tans were supposed to act as policemen to bolster the police forces.\n\nBoth groups would end up being called the Black and Tans. It's highly unlikely that Dominc Beehan heard his father calling out to the Black and Tans to come out and fight after 1923, because the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Divison were recruited starting in 1919 and were disbanded by 1922.  \n\nIn addition the Black &amp; Tans were stationed in hot spots, mostly in rural areas of the country. Thus it would be highly unlikely for a unit of them to be stationed in Dublin itself, *especially* in a Loyalist neighborhood. \n\nFinally it would be unlikely to Black and Tans in Dublin proper, because the vast majority of them were not Irish (most of them were English). Those neighbors of Dominic's who were part of any military force were far more likely to be part of the RIC than anything else.\n\n    Tell her how the IRA made you run like hell away,\n    From the green and lovely lakes of Killeshandra.\n\nI've been interested in the Irish conflict for many years (though I haven't studied it like I've studied the American Revolution), and I've never been able to find any action that took place in Killeshandra. I've read many of the action reports from county Cavan (which Killeshandra is part of) and haven't ever seen anything regard any action against the Black and Tans in Killeshandra. I've asked experts in the Irish War of Independence the same question and they haven't been able to tell me anything either.\n\nHowever there was a *very* famous action against the Auxiliary Division in the area of Kilmichael, which involved 36 members of Tom Barry's flying column killing 17 Auxiliary Division members. \n\nThe event is depicted in [this](http://youtu.be/ypmqbBdp6fg) scene from the movie *Wind That Shakes the Barley*\n\nIt seems odd that Behan's father would use an unknown action to taunt his neighbors, and I kind of think that the action that was meant was the Kilmichael one--only it doesn't fit into the line as well as does Killeshandra.\n\n    Come tell us how you slew\n    Them ol' Arabs two by two,\n\n    And you frightened all the natives to the marrow.\n\nI have no idea what action this could be. The Wikipedia page on the song seems to think that this is reference to the Arab revolt of 1920. However that presents a major problem with the timeline, since the Black and Tans were composed of ex-British soldiers who were mostly recruited in 1919. Very unlikely that any British soldiers who participated in the Arab revolt would have made it home in time to sign up for the Black and Tans. \n\nMaybe it's an event in WWI, but the British didn't see much combat against Arab forces in WWI, and most of it was limited to light weapons. \n\n    Like the Zulus they had knives and bows and arrows;\n\nThe Anglo-Zulu war was fought in 1879. Any member of the Black and Tans or Auxiliary Division who had fought in that war would be at least 60 years old (assuming that they were 16 when they fought against the Zulus). I guess it's not beyond the realm of possibility that a few members of the B&amp;Ts or the Auxiliaries had participated in the Anglo-Zulu war but I find it *highly* unlikely. \n\n    Of how bravely you faced one with your sixteen-pounder gun\n\nWell the British didn't use 16-pounder guns in the Anglo-Zulu war. In fact I'm not sure that the British army fielded any 16 pounder guns at all. /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov and /u/nmw would probably know more about this than I would.\n\nThe primary artillery piece in WWI would have been the 18-pounder gun, not a 16-pounder gun. [This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/68_pounder_fort_nelson.JPG) gun fires a 68 pound projectile using a 16 pound powder charge, but I really doubt that the song is referring to a 19th century gun.\n\n    How you slammed the brave Parnell\n\nThis refers to Charles Stewart Parnell, one of the major figures in 19th century Irish resistance. He died in 1891 of pneumonia, so it's quite possible that Behan's Loyalist neighbors might have slandered the brave Parnell.\n\n&gt;When our heroes of sixteen were executed\n\nRefers to the execution of the leaders of the Easter rebellion. \n\n&gt;Oh! Come out you British Huns\n\n/r/Badanthropology! The British can't be Huns, because the Huns were a group of people who lived in Eastern Europe and who disappeared by the 7th century A.D.\n\nThis last verse isn't a Dominic Behan original, but it's still got badhistory in it. \n\n    Show your wife how you won medals up in Derry\n\nThis refers to the actions of [Bloody Sunday \\(1972\\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_%281972%29) when British troops shot 26 civilians. No medals were given out for this action.\n\n    You murdered sixteen men and you'll do the same again\n\nActually 14 men were killed that day. Thirteen died immediately or very soon after. One died from his wound 4 1/2 months later. \n",

        "text": "In 1974, a rising pop group from Sweden stunned the world by [winning the Eurovision Song Contest with a bouncy love ballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FsVeMz1F5c) that improbably took the Emperor Napoleon's 1815 defeat at Waterloo as its pretext.  ABBA (as they were called) were largely unknown in the English-speaking world in spite of a strong showing at the previous year's Eurovision competition, but the surprise victory of \"Waterloo\" -- one of the first songs at the competition to be sung in English instead of in its creators' native tongue -- helped cement the band's status as one of the premier pop/disco groups in the world.  The album of the same name had been released the previous month (March of 1974), and quickly climbed the charts.\n\nBut what are we to make of ABBA's \"Waterloo\" as a piece of historiography?\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the lyrics:\n\n&gt;     My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender\n&gt;     Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way\n\n&gt;     The history book on the shelf\n&gt;     Is always repeating itself\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     I was defeated, you won the war\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Promise to love you forever more\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Couldn't escape if I wanted to\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Knowing my fate is to be with you\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Finally facing my Waterloo\n\n&gt;     My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger\n&gt;     Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight\n&gt;     And how could I ever refuse?\n&gt;     I feel like I win when I lose\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     I was defeated, you won the war\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Promise you'll love me forever more\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Couldn't escape if I wanted to\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Knowing my fate is to be with you\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Finally facing my Waterloo\n\n&gt;     So how could I ever refuse?\n&gt;     I feel like I win when I lose\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Couldn't escape if I wanted to\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Knowing my fate is to be with you\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Finally facing my Waterloo\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Knowing my fate is to be with you\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Finally facing my Waterloo\n\nWhile the song manages to achieve a certain blamelessness by skirting around historical detail, there's enough in here to cause any BadHistorian to reach for the bottle.  Let's consider some of the highlights:\n\n&gt;     My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender\n\nDear God, **no**.  Napoleon himself did not surrender at all at the Battle of Waterloo.  On the heels of his Hundred Days' reign in Paris after his audacious coup over the army at Grenoble, Napoleon still nursed the faint hope of consolidating the forces that remained to him after the events of 18 June.  He only fled the field after the collapse of his line and the encirclement of the Old Guard, himself having remained until dusk commanding the square nearest his headquarters at the Inn of Belle-Alliance.  15,000 of his men had left the field of Waterloo alive and at liberty, and a further 33,000 under General Grouchy were still at large -- and had indeed won a victory over the Prussians at Wavre that very afternoon, pursuant to the Emperor's orders.  In spite of Napoleon's immense frustration that the letter countermanding those orders and ordering Grouchy's army to Waterloo had seemingly never reached him (it would not do so until around 10PM, hours after Napoleon had already withdrawn), there was still hope that this army might reform in defense of Paris and Napoleon himself raise new levies to continue the fight against the Coalition.\n\nNapoleon's actual surrender would happen in several stages; he formally abdicated in favour of his son on 22 June, fled Paris on 24 June, and finally turned himself over to the custody of Captain Frederick Maitland of HMS *Bellerophon* at Rochefort on 15 July.\n\nIn any event, this is all a very far cry from the blasphemous lie attested by the song's opening words.\n\n&gt;     Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way\n\nThis erroneously views history in a deterministic sense, as though events must unfold in a certain way and \"destinies\" may be achieved rather than ridiculed squarely for the fantasies they are.  We must also pause to consider the unlikelihood that the events described above could in any way meaningfully approximate the experiences of someone deciding to date someone else.  It's certainly true that on the night an ex-girlfriend and I had our first date I was constantly checking my texts to see if the 30,000 men I had sent out under my roommate's command to harry the Prussians would return in time to let me call the date off early, but there any similarities must end as they began.\n\n&gt;     The history book on the shelf\n&gt;     Is always repeating itself\n\nThat history repeats itself is as much an empty platitude as that it is written by a coalition of conspirators led by Victor Hugo, Victor Garber, and Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     I was defeated, you won the war\n\nAgain, this is very far from being strictly accurate.  Napoleon himself was not defeated, and neither were his forces *in toto*.  Nearly 50,000 men escaped destruction or capture at the hands of the Coalition, and it was not until Napoleon's return to Paris that he discovered that both the populace and the civil government had turned against him.  Even at that, the final battle of the war would not even be fought until 3 July -- many days after the Emperor had actually abdicated, though still before he had formally turned himself over to the English.\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Couldn't escape if I wanted to\n\nThis is also a flagrant lie.  Napoleon did indeed escape in good order (though his carriage eventually had to be abandoned, and was captured by Coalition forces with many of his documents and valuables still in it) and returned to Paris.  From there his escape continued, taking him to the coast of France.  There are apocryphal reports that he had intended to board a sympathetic ship and make his way to the Americas, but mounting concerns over his official \"outlaw\" status (declared at the Congress of Vienna in March of 1815) and the dead-or-alive price placed upon his head by the Prussians saw him instead surrender to Captain Maitland on the assurance of safe conduct to England, where he hoped (not without reason) to receive a sentence of permanent house arrest.  This did not end up happening, of course, and he was instead exiled to St. Helena -- but even then it must be asked whether or not he would have been able to escape from there if he had desired to.  He had escaped Elba without any great difficulty, but that was when chaos reigned and hope remained.  We will never known what he might have done from St. Helena if only he had willed it so.\n\n&gt;     Waterloo\n&gt;     Finally facing my Waterloo\n\nMore of the deterministic view, as though Waterloo and its consequences were something that sat inexorably in the path of Napoleon's life.  Any number of things -- down to the mute and mindless alteration of the weather -- might have shifted the battle in his favour, so treating it as though it was fated seems insane.  \n\n&gt;     My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger\n\nDebatable.  Napoleon's Old Guard remained more or less intact, and constituted some of the finest infantry in Europe.  Blücher's arrival was fortuitous but not pre-ordained, and on his own he and his men could not have been decisive.  Grouchy's absence was pivotal, certainly, but should we really consider the Coalition \"stronger\" when it achieved this strength only by the absurd and unfortunate absence of two-fifths of the opposing force?  In any case, \"strength\" is always a relative thing.  The Royal Scots Greys were derisively known (by the French, at least), as the \"noblest cavalry in Europe -- and the worst led.\"  What consequences would that have?  The French light cavalry charged at an opportune time but did not withdraw as it should have, instead facing the catastrophe of sprawling over a sunken road and being decimated (or I guess more than decimated) by massed British infantry squares.  Was the cavalry really not \"stronger\"?  Were the infantry \"stronger\" just because of how they were standing?  An endless debate. \n\n&gt;     Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight\n\nFair enough, I suppose; the only way the Emperor could have consolidated his remaining troops was indeed by withdrawing, and so he did.\n\n&gt;     And how could I ever refuse?\n&gt;     I feel like I win when I lose\n\nI don't even begin to know what this means.  At no point during any of the events occurring between 18 June and 15 July did the Emperor \"feel like he had won.\"  We have evidence that he conducted his affairs in a sense of hope, but his actions during this period show that he was more than aware of the realities facing him.  As for how he could ever refuse?  Well -- twenty years spent at war and creating a nation and a legal code that redefined civil, economic, and military life in Europe.  Twenty years spent shaping a continent to his will, treating with duplicitous and skeptical enemies, conducting diplomacy across half the earth in dozens of languages, reforming a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, engaging in dozens of intrigues and affairs, inspiring and hating a people in equal measure, kidnapping pontiffs and emancipating Jews and flirting with Islam, bringing his nation to its greatest glory AND its greatest defeat, attempting to embody an entire Revolution in the person of one unhappy man -- I say again, **well**.  How could he ***but*** refuse?\n\n**TL;DR:** A song being catchy is no guarantee that it is also accurate as a piece of historiography.",

However I do know that Muhammad [didn't](http://ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu/@themes/islam/conquest_maps/islamic-conquest_map632.JPG) conquer Egypt; later Arab conquests did that. I also know that gunpowder (and therefore cannons) were not [even in existence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon#History) during Muhammad's lifetime. \n\nThen he started to talk about the Freemasons. There was nothing particularly bad (it was all pretty bad), but he didn't seem to realize that the Freemasons among the founding fathers were not really the same thing as the masons that helped construct buildings during the Middle Ages. He also started talking about how they were the only ones who understood architecture and that their understanding came from secret knowledge preserved from the Egyptians. No one else had ANY understanding of how architecture worked. \n\nThis last detail is just incredibly insulting to the normal people. Included in this secret knowledge was things like creating a doorway with two posts and a crossbeam. Anyone can figure that out. Someone might be better at it, but it doesn't take a genius to connect three sticks. Unfortunately, everyone in the Middle Ages was apparently so devoid of intelligence that they could do what children do when given wood blocks. \n\nNow comes the really bad history. Prepare the liquor, lots of it. \n\n&gt;Masons couldn't say how they knew how to build buildings because if they talked about how they really knew what to do (math and calculating forces) the Church would accuse them of heresy because those things were beyond the comprehension of everyone but God himself. After accused of heresy theywould be burned at the stake. \n\nBurned at the stake for math. What. The. Serious. Hell. \n\nAs proof of this he mentioned Galileo.\n\n&gt;Galileo was imprisoned for proving that gravity existed. If he hadn't been so well connected, he also wouldn't been burned at the stake.\n\nWhat really happened with Galileo has been discussed here before. However, I don't think we've previously found it necessary to explain that Christianity actually does support math, least of all to a Christian. The Church is perfectly fine with math and architecture. If you'd like proof, I point [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Tobu_World_Square_St_Peters_Basilica_2.jpg). Or [here](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/12/28/travel/28day395.jpg). Or [here](http://fourriverscharter.org/projects/Inventions/images/gothic_cathedrals5.jpg). Or [here](https://buildingfailures.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hagia-sophia.jpg). Or to any of the numerous Christians who throughout history used math in various ways. \n\nI can't even explain how angry these last two points made me. It takes the points of Atheist bad history and makes them even more extreme. The worst detail is that he isn't an atheist. He is a devoted Christian at a Christian university (which generally has very good faculty). I don't know where he got these ideas, but I could hardly believe it when I heard it. It made me so incredibly angry and I could barely keep myself from just standing up and saying he was full of crap. It's insulting to Christians, to history, to the truth. This man should not be allowed to say anything about history until he clears each and every statement with the history department (which is excellent thank goodness). He keeps talking about things of which he has no knowledge and he sounds increasingly ignorant each day. The worst part is that no one else in the class is a history major so they might never know how ignorant he is. The thought of this man teaching students angers me to no end. \n\nFor the record: I'm conflating the Middle Ages and the Renaissance because he clearly doesn't know the difference and he keeps conflating them himself. I'm sorry for those of you who know the difference. ",

In the above list that would be any country which is marked as green, yellow have been reserved [in the previous thread](www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2uvruo/meta_badhistory_universalis_starts_next_saturday/) for the player mentioned next to it and **red are off-limit** due to base tax and in Japan's case the ridiculous vassal situation.\n\n**Info:**\n\n- **You only need the base game**, DLCs are shared by the host.\n\n- If you are running late or crash out I will enable hotjoining so you should be able to return, just keep in mind that when you don't play your country will be run by the AI. Seeing as we currently have about 50 players pre-registered, **there will be no pausing unless previously agreed upon**, we'll try what speed everyone is comfortable with and aim to stay at that.\n\n- The primary means of communication (apart from in-game chat obviously) is [Teamspeak](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads). As it is international trend we will be using a server in Luxembourg to protect out clients from taxation.

Going live about a quarter hour before starting time.  \nEDIT: **we are live now.**  \nEDIT 2: apparently no one can find it... looking into it  \nEDIT 3: someone else hosted it, if you don't find it on the list try joining the Steam group chat and right clicking *DinoFunk* and clicking *join game*\n\nObservers are welcome if they don't want to play but still watch. You can either join the server/TS and don't chose a country or view a stream. Currently the only one who notified me that he will be streaming was /u/Legion4800 as mighty Cyprus ([link to his Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/legion4800)).\n\nI think that is all. Good luck and good fun!\n\nEDIT 4: aaaaand we're out, 3 1/2 hours after the planned start, probably more like 2 1/2 hours actual game time with that weird server stuff at the start and three hotjoin waves.\nThank you to everyone who came, we're hoping to see you and many more next week. For those who missed it we'll be providing an overview what happened soon. [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/notamacropus/profile/past_broadcasts) will also keep archived for a week or so my terrible last-minute stream of me getting slowly crushed to death as Ryazan and then crashing and waiting to join back in twice as Saxony ... it's audio at least I guess.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2vkib2/how_christian_dior_me_is_not_an_inaccurate/",
        "text": "Today is a sad day. Why is today sad, you might ask? Well, for starters, I realised my Evita soundtrack CD that has been my friend and companion for many a year has stopped working. In addition to that, though, I finally decided to buckle down and do a bad history post about one of my absolute favourite movies, Evita. \n\nOh, not the whole thing. God no, not the whole thing. My poor, tender heart couldn't take that hurt. But I can look at [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MguxA61ZtZ8). Well, maybe not the whole thing. But I can look at two lines. Yes. I think I can do that.\n\nAt one point, Evita sings, \"I come from the people. They need to adore me, so Christian Dior me, from my head to my toes.\" This is part of her preparation for Eva's 1947 Rainbow Tour across Europe, a tour which is interesting in and of itself, but not the focus of this particular post. No, instead I'd like to look at the fact that Christian Dior was not Eva Peron's fashion of choice prior to the Rainbow Tour, nor are 1947 pieces by Christian Dior depicted in the film.\n\n[This](http://i.imgur.com/ylRmtmm.jpg) is an example of a piece made by Christian Dior as part of the spring and summer line-up for 1947. As you can see, it has fairly neutral colours, with beige and black being the main themes. It's also a bit flouncy at the bottom, a look that epitomised Christian Dior's style until the mid-1950s and was known as the \"new look.\" Indeed, the New Look was so popular that it manage to put the Parisian fashion industry back on the map, especially after European aristocracy started wearing it. \n\nCompare that to [this](http://i.imgur.com/AwCHGnt.jpg) image of Evita when she's singing about being Christian Diored. There's a striking difference between what she's being dressed up in and actual Christian Dior style. Here, the clothes are more colourful and tight-fitting, things that lie in direct opposition to the ideals of the New Look. Rather than being representative of French fashions, these dresses are instead representative of Argentine fashions of the time. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-DZAMhpXA) shows a little bit of the fashions that were popular in Argentina (skip to about 3:00 unless you want to admire llamas, and I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to see llamas with ear tassles), and they are rather different from Christian Dior's creations. Argentine fashion focused on being more skin-tight and colourful, as well as being accompanied by large hats and flouncy hair styles. This is all a far cry from Christian Dior, and much more accurately reflects Argentine fashion.\n\nIndeed, the film version has quite a few fashion mistakes in this one section. Eva was a bit famous for wearing a fox fur coat (which you can see in [this clip](http://i.imgur.com/ZfsdEbW.jpg)) even in Rome where it was bloody sweltering. The fur she is wearing in the \"Christian Dior me\" is clearly not the same, and is probably not her famous fox fur cape. However, Evita was known for her ostentatious fashion sense, so the fact that she owns multiple furs is probably not bad history. \n\nLater on, however, Eva sings that she wants her aides to \"Lauren Bacall me,\" another demand for a particular fashion. While Lauren Bacall was indeed a model in the 1940s, she wasn't exactly world famous. In fact, Bacall's major breakthrough roles didn't occur until the mid-1940s (with *To Have and Have Not* finally being the film that would make her famous). However, since Eva Peron had previously been an actress, she likely would have been at least passingly familiar with Bacall and her work. The problem is, though, that Bacall's style looks nothing like what Eva was wearing. [This](http://i.imgur.com/kgjhKGQ.jpg) is an image of Lauren Bacall from 1943, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/gxYH6x6.jpg) is from 1947. These are both radically different from what Eva describes as [\"Lauren Bacall me\"](http://i.imgur.com/hspPOIO.jpg), as, once again, Eva dons a fur coat and a low cut druss with a gaudy brooch. \n\nInterestingly, one reason why Eva's Rainbow Tour was unsuccessful in places like France and England was specifically because of Eva's ostentatious Argentine style. In Argentina, her big hair styles, colourful dresses, and lavish jewellery worked in her favour. It allowed her to be a performer in Argentina and craft a particular public persona that appealed to Argentinians. It created something that oozed social power, which in turn allowed her to climb the ranks of the social ladder. In Europe, however, this fashion sense was just seen as garish and unnecessary, likely contributing to the reaction against her in places that had more minimalist fashions.\n\nEva Peron would eventually be Christian Diored, though that would be after her return from the Rainbow Tour.  After her return from the Rainbow Tour, she adopted more European styles, losing her extravagant hair styles and form-fitting dresses in favour of flouncier dresses and bun hair. [This](http://i.imgur.com/5qmHiRt.jpg), for instance, is a picture of Eva wearing a Christian Dior dress in 1950. Her hair is different, and the dress is definitely different from [this dress](http://i.imgur.com/fsV4EX4.jpg) that she wore for the presidential portrait. Her hair is also less shiny and less boldly gold. There is a clear difference between Christian Diored Evita and Rainbow Tour Evita, and this movie doesn't respect that.\n\nFinally, since someone got me started on it, [this](http://i.imgur.com/xNe1OhA.png) is not what Eva was wearing in Spain. [This](http://i.imgur.com/tvPfZIX.jpg) is what she was wearing. In the photo, you can clearly see she's not wearing a fur coat. Jeez, movie, it's like you don't even care. \n\nThat said, it does do a great job with Eva's hair. Kudos to movie for fully capturing the evolution of Eva Peron's hair styles.\n\nSources:\n\n...oh god, this is where I'm supposed to admit how many biographies of Eva Peron I've read, isn't it?",

This user, who is the moderator a bunch of other racist and antisemitic subs,  copypastes shit like this from time to time, so I guess I just decided to have a look at it (I initially posted yesterday night, but I deleted after advice from /u/Quouar.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional historian, and my amateur expertise has nothing to do with US history.

However, that does not mean that immigrants, indentured servants, and people in interment camps were:\n\n* treated as chattel, with very little legal rights\n\n* regularly sold by their masters/employers, with families often being separated\n\n* unlikely to be freed/emancipated from their masters/employers/internment camps, with little chance of social mobility\n\n* officially barred from learning how to read (as slaves were [in Alabama](http://www.archives.alabama.gov/teacher/slavery/lesson1/doc1-9.html), for example)\n\n* [regularly raped](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2kfty5/did_a_high_or_low_of_american_slaveowners_rape/cll3ux3) or otherwise coerced into sexual relations with the master/employer\n\nIt's ridiculous to claim that the Chinese, the Irish, and the Japanese had it worse than the slaves.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n# \"Irish slaves\"\n\n&gt; For instance, an Irish slave was worth nothing basically. They didn't care whether they lived or died. A black slave had a lot of money tied into it. For instance, the last 10 years before the civil war, the best slave hand was worth around 56000 dollars in today's money. You would take care of that kind of investment, no?\n\nAn \"Irish slave\" is a misnomer, because the majority of Irish \"slaves\" in the Americas were more or less voluntary indentured servants. [This](http://www.academia.edu/9475964/The_Myth_of_Irish_Slaves_in_the_Colonies) is a nice (and long) essay on the \"Irish slaves,\" and I'm basing what I'm saying here on that essay.\n\nSo, there were three main forms of bondage in the colonies: indentured servitude, forced labor, and chattel slavery. \n\n&gt; The majority of the indentured labourers from Ireland who emigrated to the West Indies in the 17th and 18th century, did so voluntarily.^6  This was part of a much larger migratory trend and it has been estimated that the ma jority of Europeans who emigrated to the American colonies were indentured servants.^7 There is a dispute over the origin of the indenture system but it appears that it was an innovation of two English customs: apprenticeship and husbandry: this innovation occurred as “some such system was necessary to ﬁnance the crossing of the Atlantic.”^8 Agreeing to an indenture meant that the cost of the migrants’ voyage to the colony was paid for, and the “recruits in turn promised to work for stated periods..”^9 Once an indenture’s term of service was complete (usually between two to seven years) they were automatically emancipated. It is important to note that potential servants in Ireland did not board the transport ships without some knowledge of the conditions on the various colonies. Anchored in Kinsale in 1636, Capt. Thomas Anthony found that the Irish labourers had a surprising amount of knowledge about the different conditions on the islands. \n\n&gt; [.....]\n\n&gt; Once an indentured servant’s term of service was over they received their “freedom dues” which was around £10 sterling, or its equivalent in tobacco or sugar. They were now free, with cash in hand. If they wished they could lease or buy land, buy or trade in slaves or hire them out to others. Alternatively they could migrate to another colony where there were better opportunities. This was all in accordance with the various colonial laws which treated indentures as bonded labour under strict contract and control, and which treated chattel slaves as non-human objects of property, i.e. livestock.\n\n&gt; The social mobility he refers to can be observed among Irish immigrants. In Montserrat, a colony where many Irish settled in the 17th century, we ﬁnd that by 1729 over sixty six percent of all the sugar planters/slave owners on the island were Irish.^12 In 1670 ten percent of the property owners in Jamaica were Irish, and in 1729 “twenty percent of the colonial assemblymen possessed Irish names.”^13 This is further illustrated, in a moderate sense, in the case of Cornelius Bryan, an emigrant labourer from Ireland. Bryan was charged with slandering the English (he was accused of threatening to drink their blood) before a Barbados Council in the 1650s. He received 21 lashes of the whip on his back as punishment. Yet by the time he died in 1687 he had progressed to the status of a small planter in Barbados. He had acquired thirteen slaves and twenty two acres of land.^14\n\n&gt; This potential for upward social mobility can also be observed in the case of two former indentured servants from Ireland, Daniel Dulany and William Killeen.^15 Dulany, who was educated at Trinity College Dublin and indentured in Maryland in 1703, became the Attorney General of Maryland, while Killeen who, “was imported as an indentured servant from Co. Clare in 1737”, eventually became the Chief Justice of the state of Delaware.^16\n\n&gt; It shall be noted that in many cases indentured servants were abused and overworked. There was even an indentured servants’ revolt in Barbados in 1647 and one in Virginia in 1663. The leaders of the Barbadian revolt were hanged but “no particular part was imputed to the Irish.”^17 Indentured servants were essentially the white, European underclass in colonial societies that were stratiﬁed by assumptions of racial superiority; ergo only non-white, non-Europeans were chattel slaves. The Indentured servants work was often brutal and the mortality rate in the colonies, across all classes, was extremely high, particularly among the ﬁrst generation of settlers. Many did not survive to see the expiration of their contract. \n\n&gt; Not all Irish indentures were employed as tradesmen, servants or labourers. Many served as soldiers in militias or in colonial armies. In this role they were charged with upholding their white supremacist society by suppressing the chattel slaves’ capacity to revolt, as well as protecting the colony from raids by other European powers.\n\n&gt; [....]\n\n&gt; The planters in Barbados had cause for worry [...] as by 1667 the Irish constituted over 50% of their 4000-man militia.^20\n\n&gt; They were also paranoid that the poor Irish would connive with the African slaves to foment rebellion. But this fear was never realised; as Rodgers put it “in the last resort the Irish did not make common cause with the slaves..[...]..they were white and wished to exercise the advantage it conferred upon them.”^21\n\n&gt; Nevertheless in Barbados in 1685, this paranoia spilled over into arrests. Twenty two slaves and eighteen Irish servants were interrogated on suspicion of being involved in a plot to revolt. All the slaves were executed and all the Irish walked free.^22\n\nBut nooooooooooo, Africans were worth more than the Irish, because otherwise, how can I \"prove\" African inferiority?\n\nLet's continue on with the essay about indentured servitude:\n\n&gt; Were indentured servants from Ireland “cheaper” than slaves? This is another misunderstood aspect of colonial history. This was not a value judgement, they were simply less proﬁtable (for obvious reasons).\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; *Better*  because they [slaves] can be tortured/murdered at will to encourage the others to work harder and for longer. *Cheaper* because they [slaves] are more proﬁtable. They [the plantation owners] will own them [slaves] for their entire life, feed them less expensive food, clothe them less, house them in worse conditions, will own their children, and will never have to pay them their freedom dues. Planters did attempt to extract the maximum amount of labour from their indentured servants while they were still in contract, but as soon as they had enough capital accumulated they invested heavily in slaves.  \n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; \"The cost of indentured servants who would work for ﬁve or six years no longer made any sense given the proﬁts to be made in the sugar boom. Under the new circumstance, the larger investment in a slave could be recouped in eighteen months - and slaves could be worked a lifetime long.\"^28\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; This rationalisation [that because Irish laborers often did dangerous jobs, they were being treated worse than slaves] erroneously removes all agency from the Irish workers, who were, unlike slaves, free to down tools and look for work elsewhere. If a slave refused to work it could lead to torture or possibly death. After all, many homicide laws in the South did not apply to the killing of “any slave dying under moderate correction.”^31 It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that Irish workers were paid for their efforts, for that is the sole reason they were *choosing* to do the work in the ﬁrst place. The work the slaves were forced to do enriched their owners, exclusively.\n\n&gt; The foundation for this myth appears to be the belief that free workers who undertook dangerous work were worse off than slaves, but only if slaves were not doing said dangerous work. This is disingenuous for the same argument cannot exist in a situation where all the workers are freemen, i.e. “I don’t want to do this dangerous work, can I be a chattel slave instead.” To paraphrase David T. Gleeson, historians have yet to encounter evidence of a free labourer pining for enchattlement.^32\n\nNow the essay turns to forced labor:\n\n&gt; The Irish that were forcibly transported to the West Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries can be classiﬁed [...] as forced labourers. This classiﬁcation includes those souls who were deported from Ireland due to military design as well as the victims of notorious criminal activity such as deceptions and kidnapping. It is important to state that, with the exception of serious criminals, on their arrival to the colonies they were invariably prescribed the same rights as voluntary indentured servants.^35\n\nAnd on chattel slavery (which is what people often refer to when they say \"slavery\"):\n\n&gt; Persons from Ireland have been held in various forms of human bondage throughout history, but they have never been chattel slaves in the West Indies.\n\nSo no, the Irish \"slaves\" in the Americas were never reduced to chattel slavery, and no, they were not treated worse than chattel slaves.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n# Slave Prices\n\n&gt; A black slave had a lot of money tied into it. For instance, the last 10 years before the civil war, the best slave hand was worth around 56000 dollars in today's money. You would take care of that kind of investment, no?\n\nIf the best slave hand being expensive means that slaves were valued in Southern society, then since the most expensive soccer ball costs millions of $, I guess soccer balls are immensely valued in modern society? Oh wait. It doesn't work like that. The average slave cost around five times cheaper than what this person gives here ([source](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dp3cb/how_much_did_slaves_in_america_cost_in_todays/) ). Furthermore, these are from 1850, which is AFAIK (correct me if I'm wrong) when slave prices were higher than the typical slave price a century before, because the Atlantic Slave Trade had stopped.\n\n\n# Dubious sources\n\n&gt;  http://www.saveyourheritage.com/white_slavery.htm\n\nClearly a neutral, reliable source.^/s I didn't even click on that link.\n\n&gt; http://www.zakkeith.com/articles,blogs,forums/anti-Chinese-persecution-in-the-USA-history-timeline.htm\n\nIt's good to talk about discrimination against the Chinese, however, that link appears to be some sort of bizarre Chinese nationalist bullshit mixed in with actual facts. And I'm pretty certain of this because of this paragraph:\n\n&gt; When did the Chinese arrive in America?\n\n&gt; If the accounts of the Chinese buddhist monk Hui Shen , who visited a land he called Fusang, are anything to go by, then in 450 AD, the Chinese traveled along what can only be the West Coast of America, southward from present-day British Columbia, to Baja California. If you believe in the theories of Gavin Menzies as put forth in his book, 1421, or Henriette Mertz’ Perl Ink (1953), or the findings of Col. Barclay Kennon (who served on the US North Pacific Surveying Expedition in 1871), or Charles Godfrey Leland (1824-1903), or Sinologist Karl Friedrich Neumann (1793-1870), the Chinese have been in the Americas for centuries, perhaps even millennia, long before the first European settlers arrived. There is also genetic evidence to support this. [said \"genetic evidence\" being the theory that people from Beringia followed the coastline into the Americas, which is completely irrelevant to the Chinese \"discovery\" of the Americas]\n\nAnd finally \n\n&gt; http://www.ushistory.org/us/51e.asp\n\nThis seems accurate, but I have no idea what the point of this link is.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSomehow, this has become too long, so see my comment below.\n",

        "text": "Today, I’d like to look at what classical and historical scholarship looked like in the early 20th century, and by extension that in the late 19th century as well, via a particular lens, in order to give all of you what I think is a good insight into a number of issues relevant to BadHistory.\n\nI have, for the purposes of research, recently been taking a look at old scholarship on the Seleukid Empire. For those unfamiliar with the Seleukids, the Seleukid state was one of several formed out of the post-Alexander-the-Great free for all derby that ensued upon the eponymous Makedonian’s death. It was founded by one Seleukos, and was an extremely major power in western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean until the mid-2nd century BCE, having been buffeted by the Romans, and then kicked out of Mesopotamia and everything east of it by the rising Arsacid state (most commonly referred to as the Parthian Empire). The rump state lingered in the Seleukid heartlands of Syria, before eventually descending into internecine irrelevance and then getting absorbed by the Romans without too much pomp or circumstance during the mid 1st century BCE. \n\nThe Seleukids are not my sole academic area of interest or focus, as people aware of my posts in AskHistorians and even in earlier BadHistory threads might already know. But what motivated this specific piece of reading was the fact that, until recently, the Seleukids tended to get very disdainfully treated by historians. It’s still an attitude that I frequently have to contend with, though I am very pleased that this is continuing to improve. But it’s also one that’s so fresh in the mouth that I don’t think it’s been critically examined the long duree, reaching back beyond ‘modern’ scholarship and into what came before. In other words, I wanted to look at the historiography of the Seleukids prior to what you might call the current post-60s era of scholarly methodology, thus I encountered the work that we’re about to look at. And, well, the first chapter alone was enough to make me want to post about a huge number of subjects on BadHistory, so make of that what you will.\n\nBefore I introduce the work and begin, I’d also like to establish that in my *own* comments, as you’ve already encountered, I tend to prefer a slightly different form of transliterating ancient Greek-derived terms than what you might be used to. If at any point this causes confusion then I apologise, because it’s not intended to do so; I just prefer rendering Greek like that, especially in ways that guide English speakers to a slightly more accurate understanding of how it was originally pronounced.\n\n**The Work and Author**\n\nThe work I’m looking at here is: *The House of Seleucus*, Volume 1, by Edwyn Robert Bevan, published in 1902.\n\nEdwyn Robert Bevan was born in London in 1870. He was the fourteenth child of Robert Cooper Lee Bevan, who was a partner in Barclays bank. We are thus immediately dealing with a very monied segment of the world’s premier imperial power. He won a classical scholarship to attend New College at Oxford University, where he did very well. For anyone familiar with Oxford you will understand what I say he achieved there, for anyone else I apologise for the fact that Oxford is very weird for anyone who didn’t attend it (which includes me); he got a first in Classical Moderations and then in Literae Humaniores, which essentially means he got the highest degree grade possible in Oxford’s equivalent of a Classics degree. This marks him out as being within the absolute apogee of the Classical academic world of the time, particularly within Britain, whilst also establishing him as being in the social and intellectual elite of Britain as well- Classics is the degree that several Prime Ministers possessed across the late 19th and 20th centuries, including William Gladstone, Herbert Asquith, and Harold Wilson. He was wealthy enough that he did not attach himself to an academic institution, and published as an independent scholar. Thus far, the House of Seleucus is the earliest such work of his that I can find, published in multiple volumes. This continued until World War One, when he worked for the Foreign Office in political intelligence and the department for Propaganda and Information, and in the post-war economic slump he finally needed a salary, so he got himself hired by Kings College London where he lectured for 11 years.\n\n**Chapter 1 of the House of Seleucus- Our Main Star**\n\nI’ll be putting some commentary in this bit, but will be saving a lot of that for later. The title of the chapter in the original is ‘Hellenism in the East’, and if you want to follow along with the full text (which I advise) rather than my abridged excerpts then [here’s a link to a copy on archive.org](https://archive.org/stream/houseofseleucusv017717mbp#page/n0/mode/2up).\n\n&gt; It is not so much the characters of the kings which gives the house of Seleucus its peculiar interest. It was the circumstances in which it was placed. The kings were (to all intents and purposes) Greek kings; the sphere of their empire was in Asia. They were called to preside over the process by which Hellenism penetrated an alien world, coming into contact with other traditions, modifying them and being modified. Upon them that process depended.\n&gt;\n \nExcusing the extremely old fashioned tone, several sentiments here would not be out of place in a modern work on the Seleukids, particularly the idea that the Seleukids both caused change and themselves changed, including by extension the Greeks settled in the Empire. Likewise, even though Greek merchants or adventurers probably penetrated the territory of the Persian Empire at some point, it’s true that much of that world was extremely poorly known to Greeks as a whole, with many prior works on geography and ethnography getting distinctly fuzzy when they passed further east than Kilikia and Phoinikia, though the word ‘alien’ might be a little extreme.\n\n&gt; Hellenism, it is true, contained in itself an expansive force, but the expansion could have hardly gone far unless the political matter had been in congenial hands.\n&gt; \n\nAgain, not a particularly controversial notion, the idea that a given polity had to be friendly towards Greek culture to promote it.\n\n&gt; As a matter of fact, it languished in countries which passed under barbarian rule.\n\nAnd here we start coming into the parts where the era of scholarship expresses itself rather clearly. I could be extremely snarky here but I’d rather be precise. Firstly, from whose point of view are we talking about barbarians- because the Romans, one of the most famous cultures with regards to adopting many trappings associated with Hellenic culture, would have been barbarians to the Greeks, particularly in the era in question. Likewise, in terms of cultures that were heavily influenced by Hellenic things that were not ruled by Greeks, we have in no particular order; the Etruscans, the other Italic speaking cultures, the Iapgyian cultures of Italy, large parts of Illyria, Carthage, the Nabataeans, parts of the Iberian peninsula, Near Eastern culture in general under the Parthians, Central Asia and what is now the Indus region under the Kushans, various cultures along the Danube… It would be considered extremely stupid these days to write off these ‘countries’ as languishing, or as barbarians (though you will still find people who persist in doing that). Making that statement means you have already written off all of these cultures as actually having any kind of development or achievements of note, or even a worthy place in the conversation of history.\n\n&gt; It was thus that the Seleucid dynasty in maintaining itself was safeguarding the progress of Hellenism.\n\nBecause, of course, all of the other Greek-ruled states, like Pergamon and its famous library, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms, had absolutely no part in promoting Hellenic culture. At all.\n\n&gt; The interest with which we follow its struggles for aggrandizement and finally for existence does not arise from any peculiar nobility in the motives which actuate them or any exceptional features in their course, but from our knowing what much larger issues were involved.\n\nNothing interesting or special happened in the Seleukid Empire’s history, and instead their importance solely lies in us recognising how the path of history developed. Yummy.\n\n&gt; At the break-up of the dynasty we see peoples of non-Hellenic culture, Persians, Armenians, Arabs, Jews, pressing in everywhere to reclaim what Alexander and Seleucus had won. They are only checked by Hellenism finding a new defender in Rome.\n&gt; \n\nBahaha, hahahaha, hahahahahaha. Because of course a non-Hellenic culture can be a defender of ‘Hellenism’, but only the super civilized ones.\n\n&gt; The house of Seleucus, however feeble and disorganized in its latter days, stood at any rate in the breach till Rome was ready to enter on the heritage of Alexander.\n&gt; \n\nHere’s another feature of the period expressing itself- the progression of civilizations and Empires. We still do this now, but not so teleologically in works of any kind of scholarly quality, and certainly not with moral purpose. Here the entire purpose of the Seleukids is to be a temporary entertainment until the real act comes on stage- the Romans. Even by trying to defend the Seleukids from criticism as irrelevant here, Bevan is still conceding to most of the basic positions- the Seleukids are important because of their relation to much more important, better things that come with Romans. This is despite calling this era foundational in the spread of ‘Hellenism’, I’ll note.\n\n&gt; But what does one mean by Hellenism?\n\nInteresting how he’s already talked about Hellenism as though everyone knows what it is, as though it has a fixed definition, and only now thinks that it’s appropriate to define it. I’ll talk about that more later.\n\nAlso, here on out’s where it gets spectacular for the modern reader.\n\n&gt; That characteristic which the Greeks themselves chiefly pointed to as distinguishing them from “barbarians” was *freedom*. The barbarians, they said, or at any rate the Asiatics, were by nature slaves. It was a proud declaration. It was based upon a real fact. But it was not absolutely true. Freedom had existed before the Greeks, just as civilization had existed before them. But these two had existed only in separation. *The achievement of the Greeks is that they brought freedom and civilization into union*.\n\nI leave you this statement with no commentary, aside from the fact that the italics are as in the text, and are not my own invention.\n\n&gt; We, like the Greeks, are apt to speak in our loose way of the Asiatic or the “Oriental”, reflecting on his servility, his patience, his reserve. But in doing so we lose sight of that other element in the East which presents in many ways the exact opposite of these characteristics. Before men had formed those larger groups which are essential to civilization they lived in smaller groups or tribes, and after the larger groups had been formed the tribal system in mountain and desert went on as before. We can still see in the East to-day many peoples who have not emerged from this stage.\n&gt;\n\nAnd so, everyone, I bring us our first, enormous, totally pure nugget of raw Orientalism. This is not our alloyed, adulterated stuff which talks about African mud huts, but also acknowledges that places like China (full of communists and worker bees), India (full of spices and mystics), Iran (full of hard line Islamists and wine) are quite different from one another. This is unmixed, unrestrained, and unbound. Nor is it to be our last.\n\nI’m skipping a chunk about the earliest known civilizations, and the freedom of primitive tribes; to Bevan, Egypt and Babylonia, though they are interesting context- the discussions of in particular Babylonia as the oldest ‘civilizations’ must postdate the beginning of archaeology in Mesopotamia, which I will come back to in the later analysis.\n\n&gt; By the time that Hellenism had reached its full development the East, as far as the Greeks knew it, was united under an Irânian Great King. The Irânian Empire had swallowed up the preceding Semitic and Egyptian Empires, and in the vast reach of territory which the Persian king ruled in the fifth century before Christ he exceeded any potentate that the world had yet seen. He seemed to the Greeks to have touched the pinnacle of human greatness.\n\nIt interested me that Bevan chooses to consciously use the term Irânian (with a little hat and everything) here, though its presence alongside Semitic means that it’s intended to be a racial categorisation- despite the fact that he knows that Persians and Iranians are two different things, nonetheless the fact that Persians are an Iranian people. Likewise, Jews, Akkadians, Arameans, Arabs, and many others are totally different peoples, yet the Neo-Babylonian and Assyrian Empires to which he refers are ‘Semitic’. This is also the first time that a race-related set of categorisations has really reared its head so far.\n\nI now skip a chunk about tribalism vs monarchy among the Persians, which doesn’t really say anything that I’d care to remark on for our current purposes, for good or ill, aside from a continued insistence on uncritically utilising Herodotus which comes up elsewhere.\n\n&gt; As an alternative, them, to the rude freedom of primitive tribes, the world, up to the appearance of Hellenism, seemed to present only unprogressive despotism. Some of the nations, like the Egyptians and Babylonians, had been subject to kings for thousands of years. And during all that time there had been no advance. Movement there had been, dynastic revolutions, foreign conquests, changes of fashioned in dress, in art, in religion, but no progress. If anything there had been decline.\n\nHere we find another raw thing that is almost always very reduced in both modern scholarship and in the modern world; a) for the purposes of the progress of history, only the Eurasian world focused around the Mediterranean and Near East *count*, and b) literally no progress existed of any real kind until the Greeks and then Romans come along. I’m also going to present this without comment, because I think it speaks for itself.\n\nWe then skip an otherwise hilarious and interesting chunk about how everyone under kings was a slave, in the interest of time.\n\n&gt; It was under these circumstances that the character we now describe as “Oriental” was developed. To the husbandman or merchant it never occurred that the work of government was any concern of his; he was merely a unit in a great aggregate, whose sole bond of union was its subjection to one external authority; for him, while kings went to war, it was enough to make provision for himself and his children in this life, or make sure of good things in the next, and let the world take its way. It was not to be wondered at that he came to find the world uninteresting outside his own concerns- his bodily wants and his religion. He had to submit perforce to whatever violences or exactions the king or his ministers chose to put upon him; he had no defence but concealment; and he developed the bravery, not of action, but of endurance, and an extraordinary secretiveness. He became the Oriental whom we know.\n\nHave another nugget! Again, there’s almost nothing I feel I actually need to say here, except to of course note that almost all societies could be summarised as having individuals primarily concerned with bodily wants and ‘religion’, if we decide to define that as ambiguously as this has done. But believe me, we’ll be coming back to ‘the Oriental’.\n\n&gt; Then with the appearance of Hellenism twenty-five centuries ago there was a new thing in the earth. The Greeks did not find themselves shut up to the alternative of tribal rudeness or cultured despotism. They passed from the tribal stage to a form of association which was neither one nor the other- the city-state. They were not absolutely the first to develop the city-state; they had been preceded by the Semites of Syria. Before Athens and Sparta were heard of, Tyre and Sidon had spread their name over the Mediterranean. But it was not till the city-state entered into combination with the peculiar endowments of the Hellenes that it produced a new and wonderful form of culture.\n\nSo, I’d just like to note that ‘Semites of Syria’ could mean, variously, Arabs, Hebrews, Arameans, Assyrians, or Canaanites/Phoenicians depending on when we’re talking about and exactly whose definition of Syria we’re talking about. From context, it’s clear that Bevan intended to specify the Phoenicians, as we’d call them, or Canaanites as they’re generally called before c.1000 BC. In the which case, his use of Syria is odd, and contrary to the definition of Syria generally used by the ancient geographers. However, the Syria of his day would have included what is now Lebanon and ancient Phoinikia. But, if he was including the territory of Ottoman or even Roman Syria, then ‘Semites of Syria’ could still have meant all of the peoples that I just mentioned. Also, there have been far more city-state cultures than the Phoenicians and the Greeks in the ancient world…\n\nI’m skipping a bit about Greek geography being a deterministic influence in their state formations.\n\n**CONT’D BELOW**\n",

        "author": "Samuel_I",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2vhbzh/napoleon_vs_george_washington_on_deadliest/",
        "text": "Well, guys I've been planning to do this for a while and /u/Bernardito's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2vffat/the_bottom_of_the_barrel_deadliest_warrior_s02e05/) finally convinced me to get moving with it. This episode of Deadliest Warrior is near and dear to me as an example of everything I hate about how history is portrayed in the media. Every stereotype about Napoleon, George Washington, the American Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars is on full display. We'll go from the Sniper Elite Minutemen™ to Napoleon as a maniacal warmonger to George Washington as the Lord and Savior of Freedom to the concept of the American Revolution being a guerrilla war. I'm qualified to speak on this subject because 1. I'm a masochist who drinks a lot and 2. up until a post about South Park/Family Guy overtook it, my highest rated [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z39i1/have_there_ever_been_any_good_dictators/c615ma2) was about Napoleon. That's a qualification, right?\n\nSo let's jump in to it, shall we? Let's see what Faramir thinks about Napoleon versus Washington! [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ssbgJ3D6cw)\n\nRight off the bat the biases of the show are laid bare with the 'megalomaniac-Napoleon' trope coming up immediately: \"obsessed with war,\" \"wanted to take all of Europe and make it his,\" \"becomes known as the God of War,\" \"the bloodthirsty French Emperor whose maniacal dream was to conquer the world.\" This all happens within the first sixty seconds of the episode. So it's pretty clear which historical narrative of Napoleon we will be working with today. I mean, why even bother with a nuanced approach? \n\nWhere even to start? First of all, very few serious historians of the Napoleonic Era are going to stereotype him as a bloodthirsty, maniacal conqueror. Even some of his staunchest critics still have to acknowledge that he was declared war upon quite a few times and was, at least a few times, the subject of outside aggression. Regardless, most of you are familiar with the debate over Napoleon's legacy, so I will say no more here, except that this tone continues throughout the episode for Napoleon. Feel free to yell at me for being a dirty Bonapartist in the comments.\n\nIn much the same way, George Washington is described as, \"The American hero who against all odds defeated the mighty British Army.\" So yes, this isn't going to be a nuanced approach either. I honestly can't decide which depiction of him is more accurate; Deadliest Warrior's or [Brad Neely's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7iVsdRbhnc). While Washington played an invaluable role in the American Revolution he was *not* held as a tactical genius and relied heavily upon successful campaigns elsewhere such as the Saratoga Campaign, the Southern Campaign, and the assistance of the French (somewhat ironically in this context). In fact, the area of battlefield tactics George Washington was most adept at would probably be retreating. What Washington is really known for is his leadership. He kept the army together after defeats and through tough times where other generals would probably have failed to do so.\n\nSo let's meet our \"experts!\" So we have a Navy Seal, whom I can only assume is a time traveler and is thus qualified to speak on \"the tactics of the warriors behind the weapons.\" A Biomedical engineer who \"applies 21st century technology to unlock new data on the arsenals of the past.\" So, being a biomedical engineer makes you a ballistic expert or something? Pretty sure he's just the guy who dresses up the dummies. Then there's an ER surgeon who is there to look at how badly a cannonball fucks up a dummy. They even talk about historical research! Which you can tell they did because the Navy Seal is gettin' [all sensual](http://youtu.be/1ssbgJ3D6cw?t=1m51s) with that big-assed book.\n\nFor Napoleon's side we get a 19th century arms expert and someone who is ostensibly a Napoleonic Historian. Though, I'm somewhat skeptical of both of these claims considering that neither manages to bring up French light infantry. Not to mention, the arms expert makes the sweeping claim that Napoleon's men had the best equipment, to which the Army of Italy would like to have a word (the Army of Italy was woefully under-supplied and -equipped at the beginning of Napoleon's campaign).\n\nFor Washington we have another swordsmen/18th century arms expert and then an ex-army officer and current history professor. \n\nThus we get to the meat of the episode: blowing things up. They start with the artillery and name the 8-pound cannon for the Napoleon and the 6-pound cannon for Washington. They do make note of the fact that Napoleon's cannon would likely have been made to a higher degree of precision, so all well and good. So they start taking their shots from 200 yards away (way too close, but I understand it's a TV show and camera concerns are important). The cannon does it's job and destroys a fake cannon and some dummies. No one is surprised. *However*, then they start going on about George Washington's 'lighter and more mobile' cannon and here we get to the first example of *George Washington has something that Napoleon also had but we're going to deprive it of him because of reasons*. Despite historical Napoleon also having access to lighter artillery than standard 8-pound guns including *gasp* horse artillery, this is glossed over in order to give Washington some form of counterbalance to the Grande Armée's superiority. So then they shoot some shots from that and go to conclusions. And this is where things start to get real screwy. The results were similar and thus they argue that the accuracy is, thus, comparable. As you'll recall, however, this was at a range of only 200 yards. It's hardly surprising for two even vastly different cannons to have similar accuracy at such a short range. Nonetheless, they gloss over this and declare them more or less equal, while noting that the 8-pound gun is heavier. \n\nThey decide on a tiebreaker; Napoleon gets properly made grapeshot compared to Washington's down-home-country scattershot. Once again, they're forcing the narrative of the outgunned and out-supplied Washington, despite the fact that grapeshot was used in the American Revolution including by, you guessed it, George Washington. Regardless, they do make the right choice giving the edge to Napoleon's artillery, especially considering that Napoleon's usage of artillery was part of what made him such a brilliant commander.\n\nThus comes the second contest: muskets and rifles. Ah yes, one of the most persistent misconceptions about the American Revolution; the American Rifleman Sharpshooter hiding behind cover and picking off those silly redcoats. So, as most of you already know, the vast majority of American soldiers in the revolution were not armed with rifles. Most of them fought with muskets that would have been more or less equivalent to the muskets that Napoleon's men were using. They carry on the misconception to it's inevitable conclusion, that muskets only had a range of ~60 yards. This is again inaccurate, as the Brown Bess and Charleville actually had an effective range of ~175 yards. Regardless of history, the Americans get 50% rifles and 50% muskets (the real number of rifles would be nowhere near this high) and the French get muskets alone.\n\nDespite Phillipe ostensibly being a historian, he furthers this line of reasoning stating that, \"Napoleon loved volley fire to make up for the lack of accuracy of the muskets.\" Uh, yeah, no. Volley fire was used by any European-style army of this time, not just Napoleon (this includes Washington's regulars and militia). Units of Foot used volley fire to mass as much firepower onto an enemy at one time as possible and to maintain fire in an orderly manner. This helps with discipline, cohesion, and shock. This is also not new. Volley fire has been around since ranged weapons and organized combat first came together. It's used for massing firepower and its effect upon the enemy. Plus, there were actually different methods of organizing firepower in Napoleonic Europe such as platoon, rank, and volley fire, used by different armies and in different applications. \"To accurately reproduce Napoleon's volley fire tactic, Mathew and three experienced blackpowder marksmen form a volley line.\" Once again, the test itself is set up to give Washington an advantage. It's five spaced-out dudes firing at five spaced out targets. This is not how battle formations worked at the time. This is far more akin to how light infantry functioned (which I will get to later) and is in no way an accurate method of demonstrating the effectiveness of volley fire.\n\nSo with the weapons and methods covered, they do their test. Unsurprisingly, the muskets are faster and less accurate, the rifles slower and more accurate. They give Washington the edge, because this was really more of a light infantry comparison than line infantry and when you disregard time and only focus on accuracy, light infantry will win every time.\n\nAnd thus we find ourselves at the single most irrelevant test: melee combat. They compare Napeolon's cavalry saber to George Washington's colichmarde. How this factors at all into one's ability to win a battle I can't tell you and will therefore ignore it. George Washington wins because his sword is made to counter sabers and Napoleon refuses to stay on his horse or something. But, then again, they did take account of the physical attributes, so whatever. Maybe it's relevant, I don't know.\n\nThey then go on to discuss two battles that optimize the tactics of the two generals: Yorktown and Austerlitz. The general narrative for Washington is that he employed guerrilla tactics to delay the British forces in the South until he could corner them at Yorktown using conventional tactics, thus they have their 'hybrid warfare'. The problem is that this isn't how it happened and it's fairly clear that their 'research' on the Southern Campaign was just watching *The Patriot* while smashing a few 40's of Bud Lite. First of all, it wasn't a guerrilla war. Yes, there were some guerrilla and irregular actions taken in instances such as the [Battle of Cowpens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cowpens) and the somewhat overstated actions of [Francis Marion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Marion), a.k.a. the Swamp Fox. However, it is important to not forget that Washington did not command at Cowpens, provide the plan for Cowpens, or teach Marion about tactics. The only real instance we have of Washington doing anything vaguely guerrilla-esque is his more symbolic than strategic victory at [Trenton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton). It wasn't a Washington commanded guerrilla campaign that kept the British occupied in the South. It was the failure of the British Saratoga Campaign and Haratio Gate's movement to the South, where he was promptly beat at the [Battle of Camden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Camden) (not guerrilla). Cornwallis tried to raise loyalist militias, but his attempts were thwarted at the [Battle of Kings Mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kings_Mountain) (not guerrilla). Then Green takes over and wins at the [Battle of Cowpens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cowpens) using, yes in this once instance, irregular tactics and soldiers to win a victory (still not guerrilla). From here there was a series of regular battles, skirmishes, and sieges of which the British were usually the tactical victors, but strategic losers. Attrition, along with a series of strategic blunders on the part of Cornwallis, took its toll on the British without reinforcements from home or the north. This is all not to mention that the only reason Cornwallis took up position at Yorktown was because he was ordered to set up a fortified port for British ships, thus allowing him to be penned in on land and sea. The ensuing [Siege of Yorktown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown) (not guerrilla) was an American victory. So was this campaign really the result of Washington's brilliant hybrid warfare seamlessly combining guerrilla and regular tactics? Of course not.\n\nTheir description of the Battle of Austerlitz, while overly simple and extremely brief, is not inaccurate and thus there isn't much need to comment on it. However, it is worth noting that Napoleon was a tactical genius and thus had a fairly large playbook not limited to the \"bait &amp; bash\" that they mention on the television show.\n\nThe last step before the simulation of the battle is the collection of \"X-factors.\" Out of the 100 factors they assign values to, they discuss the following three in detail:\n\n1. Generalship: They give the edge to Washington, mostly due to Napoleon's 'impatience.' They base this mostly on the Russian Campaign of 1812, despite having twenty years of nearly continuous warfare (and Napoleon's successes to choose from). They emphasize his greatest defeat (I would personally put it above Waterloo and Leipzig) as what symbolizes everything about him. They don't at all delve into why he attacked Russia or instances where he was shown to be quite patient, such as waiting for the reply of the Tsar to his extended offer of peace while in Moscow, you know, during the Russian Campaign. So George Washington wins 'because he was patient enough to do what it would take to win.' As if Napoleon had failed to demonstrate this trait by being the first person to conquer Italy since Justinian. They even point out George Washington's defeats earlier in the program without those counting against him.\n\n2. Fatigue: Washington wins again because of the Russian Campaign. Let's not worry about Napoleon's campaign against the Genoans and Austrians where his troops moved so fast that they could not keep track of him. Let's not worry about the French Campaign of 1814 where Napoleon was only able to hold on for so long because of his masterful lightning advances. No, let's give it to Washington because his strategy was \"prolonging the battle\" and because he was moving quickly in a local area. Well, it's kind of hard to restrict your battle to a small, local area when all of Europe is at war with you.\n\n3. Logistics: They rightfully give it to Napoleon, but for the wrong reasons. Once again, they're comparing Washington's one war (ignoring the Seven Years War because Washington didn't do so hot, I presume) against Napoleon's seven. When they say things like, \"Napoleon's men had the equipment and the training,\" they neglect points where he did not have either. The Italian Campaign comes up again, because essentially every positive thing they say about Washington can be applied to Napoleon in Italy. His troops were ill-equipped, undisciplined, and relatively untrained. And yet he defeated his enemies time and time again. Napoleon's obsession over ledgers and figures, his ability to assign competent men to logistical tasks, and his methods for ensuring his men always had food made him a logistical *master*, even when everything external pointed to an unfavorable situation. Here again they bring up Russia completely out of context and dock him their fake points, while not bringing up the same reasoning for Washington's Valley Forge campaign.\n\nThe battle simulation goes as the rest of the episode would lead us to believe it would. Washington manages to squeeze by in a relatively close victory. As the battle is between Napoleon with four men and Washington with four men, it's hardly relevant to any discussion of the relative merits of their battlefield prowess anyway. There's nothing approaching proper scale. This is really like asking, \"JEFFERSON DAVIS OR ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO WOULD WIN?\" It has nothing to do with their qualities as generals or their militaries, it would just be whichever one of them is stronger. By the way, Lincoln would win because he's a million feet tall and has an axe.\n\nThe simulation also suffers from absolutes and limited options. Napoleon had artillery other than 8-pound guns. Washington had more than just 6-pound guns with no grapeshot. Both had cavalry (though Napoleon has the advantage here). They limit themselves to produce false dichotomies between the armies; i.e. Napoleon had this, Washington had this. This utterly fails in producing anything like a legitimate battle. Let's get the Total War Engine on this!\n\nIn closing, I'd like to address a few more things that they completely gloss over, that really help to put this ridiculousness into further perspective.\n\n1. **Napoleon was the true master of hybrid warfare**: Napoleon's *corps* system was revolutionary in its ability to combine infantry (light and line), cavalry, and artillery into cohesive, self-supporting units. It was an organization masterstroke that allowed his units to never be left without complimentary military support. George Washington was not, in any way I can think of, a military innovator. \n\n2. **I'd take Napoleon's light infantry over Washington's Minutemen and Pennsylvania Riflemen any day**: Surprise guys! Napoleon actually had [light infantry](http://www.napolun.com/mirror/web2.airmail.net/napoleon/infantry_Napoleon.html#frenchdifferences) (so did the British in the American Revolution, but that's neither here nor there). This means that their view of the Americans as the masters of irregular warfare is essentially moot. The Voltigeurs were some of the finest light infantry on the Continent. Scharnhorst later recalled, \"The physical ability and high intelligence of the common man enables the French light infantryman to profit from all advantages offered by the terrain and the general situation, while the phlegmatic Germans, Bohemians and Dutch form an open ground and do nothing but what their officers order them to do.\" This assertion that Washington and the American militia and fronteirsmen could stand up to Napoleon and his Chassuers and Voltigeurs is absurd.\n\n3. **George Washington could not have become king**: this misconception is rooted in a single letter written to Washington by a subordinate officer. There was no widespread support among the elites or the people for this. When they mention this falsehood in the show, they say it almost as a positive, to show how awesome he was and how much his men look up to him. However, they neglect to mention that Napoleon's people made him Emperor not once, but *twice*. His men protected him from the Assembly and the Monarchists alike. They welcomed him back after his return from Exile. Seriously, how much of Napoleon's history can the gloss over?\n\n4. **Napoleon's military accomplishments are orders of magnitude more impressive than Washington's**: Washington took on an army of soldiers that were thousands of miles from home on his home turf with a decent amount of popular support. Napoleon not only took on that same power with only the English Channel between them, but literally every other Great Power in Europe. He rose from being a very minor noble to Emperor of the French and King of Italy. His opponents measured their might in the hundred of thousands. There' simply no contest.\n\n5. Feeding from point four, **\"Generals of Generals, Two of the Greatest Generals in History**: Washington was a competent commander and an excellent leader. He held his men together and conducted his tactical and strategic plans well enough to prevent his losses from destroying him and to ensure his victories led to further successes. With relatively limited resources he was able to lead a campaign that broke the resolve of a foreign army and lead to them coming to terms. He had numerous defeats, but also some solid victories.\nNapoleon was a brilliant commander, a hugely inspirational leader leader, and master of logistics. He won 40 victories and lost only a few battles. In his final battle at Waterloo he was outnumbered, outflanked, outgunned, and out-supplied. Yet his opponent still called it the \"nearest run thing you ever saw in your life.\" He took an inexperienced, under-supplied, under-disciplined army and used it to outfox Austria in Italy. He assembled a coalition of nations that was capable of standing up the Great Powers of Europe. He is still studied today for his tactics, strategies, logistical systems, and leadership qualities.\nWhen they say that these are two of greatest generals in history, it is simply not true... for one of them. Washington simply doesn't have the CV to live up to that title. Napoleon most certainly does.\n\n6. **Hey Mr. Military expert, it's pronounce *CAV-AL-REE*, not *CAL-VAR-EE*: Seriously, could they not find a guy who knows how to pronounce this word? While we're on the subject though, Napoleon has far more experience with cavalry. So, that's another point in his favor. Cavalry was pretty important.\n\n7 **In the end, they had to constantly manipulate the data, pick and choose what to include and what not to include, and pile things in Washington's favor in order to have this outcome**.\n\nSo there it is /r/BadHistory. Let me know what you think! I'm off to get another drink.\n\nEdit for the sake of /u/smileyman. I'm not saying that George Washington was in any way an incompetent general. He accomplished an impressive feat in winning the American Revolutionary War. If I was not 100% fair to him in my portrayal of him, it's because of the way he is held up as a god in the show. While I disagree with /u/smileyman in terms of exactly how good Washington was, we agree that he was by no means a bad or inept commander.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I'm Bernardito. Some of you might know me as the go-to guy on counterinsurgency questions in /r/AskHistorians. Today, I am going to descend the barrel to reach its bottom and explore a particular episode of Spike TV's infamous \"Deadliest Warrior\". Why Bernardito, you might ask, why do you feel that it is necessary to correct something which is so obviously wrong? \n\nBecause misconceptions surrounding both the Waffen-SS and the VC are still widespread. Incredibly so. In fact, the lack of knowledge and understanding of the Vietnam War on Reddit is on the scale of embarrassing and I have to restrain myself from reading the comments on Vietnam War topics whenever they appear on Reddit. I spend a lot of time educating individuals on the subject of counterinsurgency and guerilla warfare in modern history, and the Vietnam War is the most popular war that is brought up and eclipse every other single counterinsurgency conflict out there. My hope is that with this post, some of you will learn just a little bit more about the VC than you knew before.\n\nBefore we start, I'd just like to say that I will use the acronym VC (short for Viet Cong, 'Vietnamese Communist') which was the nickname that the South Vietnamese gave to the fighters of the armed wing of the *Front national de libération du Sud Viêt Nam*. The official names for the armed wing of the FNL varied throughout the years and I have chosen to simply use the popularized VC instead. \nSo, let's begin shall we?\n\nThe show always start with the introduction of the two sides, swiftly summarized in the opening and then slightly longer in the first few minutes of the show.\n\nThus, the VC is introduced as the following:\n\n*\"The Viet Cong. The rag-tag guerrilla force who took the US military head on and won the Vietnam War.\"*\n\nBy the time of the American escalation of the Vietnam War in 1965, the main force Viet Cong was not a rag-tag guerrilla force. It was a highly trained, highly mobile guerrilla force who were very much like professional soldiers. They were not part time guerrillas like the regional or local VC forces and were usually given the most up-to-date weaponry available. The image of the VC as a bunch of peasants fighting the US with rocks and stones and defeating them against all odds is an image conjured by North Vietnamese propaganda which had an enormous influence in shaping the contemporary image of the Viet Cong soldier outside of South Vietnam, an image that is still with us today.\n\nThe VC did not take the US military \"head on\" either. Now, to be fair, there was a brief period in '65-'66 in which the VC engaged in what is usually called a \"big unit\" war but the Vietnam War was characterized by guerrilla warfare and it was carried out according to Mao's theory on guerrilla warfare which is divided into three stages: beginning with making the population politically aware and building a base of operations and ending with the third stage in which the guerrilla army would transform into a conventional army and start conventional operations against another conventional force. While attempts were made at reaching that third stage (the Vietnamese use of Mao's theory was actually quite fluid), a successful transition to that stage was not carried out until 1974 by which time the Americans had been gone for a year and the VC essentially out of the picture.\n\nAnd the second introduction:\n\n*\"Versus the vicious Viet Cong. Murderous masters of jungle warfare. Architect of hidden horror during the Vietnam War.\"*\n\nThis isn't actually a wrong statement beyond the idea that the VC were 'masters of jungle warfare'. The VC definitely made very good use of the jungle, but South Vietnam is characterized by a whole array of different environments, from swamps to mountains, to open plains and jungles. I won't be too picky about this, however.\n\nFollowing that, the VC made very good use of the psychological effect of booby traps. While the Punji sticks has been mythologized by Vietnamese tour guides at Cu Chi for the last few decades, it was mines that caused more casualties than feces on a pointy stick. Regular mines, control detonated mines and other booby traps that included grenades (hidden in items which soldiers were known to kick, such as empty cans or clay mud balls), smaller explosive devices and bullets put into a bamboo tube which was triggered by the push of a foot (known as \"toe popper\"), larger explosives such as duds from bombs that had been dropped over South or North Vietnam and rigged in the field by the VC/NVA as well as artillery rounds. These devices had a tremendous effect on the psychological (not to mention physical) well being of soldiers in the field. Men would constantly be anxious and stressed due to the random nature of the booby traps; they could be the unlucky ones to step onto a \"toe popper\" or trigger a Bouncing Betty next. \"Hidden horror\" indeed.\n\nIn the introduction, there are accompanying action sequences where the warriors pull of some cool shit. The VC have three sequences: a US tent set up by a creek (?) is assaulted by a couple of VC fighters without apparently hearing them approach at all or having any soldiers on the lookout (as well as other safety precautions, like setting up C4). There is another sequence of a US soldier being the unfortunate victim of a booby trap, but it's the last sequence which is simply downright stupid. three VC soldiers are running from a UH-1 \"Huey\" helicopter. One of the soldiers, armed with a MAT-49, a French submachine gun, turns around and aimlessly fires into the sky which against all odds (and belief) hits the helicopter which descends into flame. Not only is the helicopter way out of the range for the MAT-49, [but the soldier in question doesn't even seem to care to aim straight.](http://imgur.com/a/iYFK6) \n\nThe VC and the PAVN did not commonly engage helicopters in flight like this. Instead, they preferred to attack helicopters that were either in low altitude, landing, lifting off or simply on the ground. For these attacks however, they would not be using submachine guns, but rather weapons like the RPG-2, RPG-7 and the B40. A lone soldier with a RPG-7 wouldn't attack alone however, and to increase their chances of success, several soldiers wielding weapons like these would fire together, usually in an ambush.\n\n*\"We are not here to argue ideologies we just want to do clean tests of the weapons and the warriors behind them\"*\n\nI'm sure this is far more aimed at the Waffen-SS than the VC, but man. This line and some of the really unintentionally offensive comments (\"No finer soldier ever fought for a worse cause\") from the Waffen-SS experts really drag this episode into the Waffen-SS glorification Hall of Fame. As you can imagine, there is no mention of the Holocaust at all.\n\nNow we get introduced to our experts! What fine scholars are going to represent the VC in what is bracing up to be a duel to be remembered in TV history?\n\nFirst up is [Tuan Nguyen](http://i.imgur.com/FRUIRDS.jpg), a.. Vietnam War survivor? The VO explains that Mr. Nguyen is a former member of the US Army but doesn't elaborate beyond that. How being a survivor from a war gives you the right to be an \"expert\" is beyond me, but there you go.\n\n[Danny Boyer](http://i.imgur.com/YuP3JgY.jpg) is our next expert, a private security contractor who primarily works in South-East Asia and was born in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. As we can see, the standards to be an expert for SpikeTV are predictably low. Scholars working with the Vietnam War aren't easy to get but I must say, these two guys are better than the [two guys over at the Waffen-SS team](http://imgur.com/a/F39Kj) who are sporting some very, uh, interesting fashion choices.\n\nBefore this sequence however, [we are introduced to the \"stats\" of the VC.](http://i.imgur.com/XTsMi97.jpg)\n\nAs we can see by this image, there are some really general descriptions (reign of terror, allegience etc.). What I will point out though is the \"reign of terror\". The VC was not active between 1954 and 1976. Considering that the FNL was founded as an organization in 1960, it would be incorrect to say that the VC (being the armed wing of the FNL) was active before that. However, the South Vietnamese insurgency had been active since the latter part of the 1950's and the first two American men to have been killed by Vietnamese insurgents were killed in 1959. [I've previously written a post about this here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ndmuo/tuesday_trivia_firsts_and_lasts/cmcpqqn), which might be worth checking out. \n\nIf we're going to be brutally honest about the end date of the VC, the FNL was disbanded in 1976. However, the VC had stopped being made up of southerners in 1968 after the Têt Offensive and played barely any part in the Ho Chi Minh campaign of 1974-75. Interestingly enough, I actually think that the \"researchers\" for the show actually got the 1954-1976 date from Wikipedia since it features very prominently on the Viet Cong page.\n\nAfter this, we get a rundown of the weapons involved on each side. [The VC are given the following weapons](http://i.imgur.com/TbvGIiD.jpg):\n\nThe MAT-49. A French submachine gun, widely used by the French Expeditionary Force during the First Indochina War, it seems like a given weapon for insurgents in South Vietnam. But the reality is that a MAT-49 was more commonly given to a local or regional force VC, not the Main Force VC who would have been equipped with an SKS earlier on in the war and the Type-56 (the Chinese copy of the AK-47) during the mid to end stages of the war. While the ranges in which the common engagements during the war itself were fought were short, an assault rifle to match the M16 was far more appropriate than an older French submachine gun. Then there is also the logistics issue. There were only so many captured MAT-49's available and while many were converted to take the 7.62×25mm cartridge, it was more common to see a Soviet submachine gun (like the PPS-43) rather than the MAT-49. \n\nI'm less picky about the choice of the POMZ-2 mine and the Punji sticks. Refer back to the section on booby traps regarding the Punji sticks. The VC used every sort of mine or grenade that they could come across, so the choice of the POMZ-2 isn't that bad.\n\nEvery modern soldier that this show includes always need to have a pistol included in the arsenal and the choice of the Tokarev TT-33 is almost obvious in this regard. The ordinary VC soldier would not have had a pistol, something more reserved for commanders or VC saboteurs fighting in urban environments. Even then, the variety of pistols exceeded that of other small-arms. One interesting example of this comes from Michael Lee Lanning, who served in the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry, 199th Infantry Brigade (Light), and who wrote that he once \"*captured a German P-38 9mm pistol, each part complete with the eagle and swastika proofmark of the Third Reich, from the deputy commander of the 274th VC Regiment in November 1969.*\"\n\nThe major portion of the show consist of weapon tests which are quite useless and mostly consist of gratuitous shots of the weapons being fired at mannequins while Geoff Desmoulin shouts \"WOAH HO HO!\". The weapons are then judged by how many of these mannequins are hit or which one looks coolest. When this is all set and done, the \"simulation\" begins and the battle is on. I'm not even going to bother go through it since by now, we've gone from an attempt to speak about history into pure fantasy. It is here which I will end my post, but not without my quick thoughts about this episode.\n\nIn a perfect world, this episode would have consisted of four scholars sitting in comfy armchairs and speaking about the average Waffen-SS and VC soldier, in the context of their times and with a large portion of the show dedicated to how post-war historiography has treated them. The fact that it has completely escaped the Deadliest Warrior producers to put any mention of the fact that there were Waffen-SS units whose primary task was fighting partisans feels like a huge missed opportunity. Then again, that would have had to include a discussion of the fact that the German counterinsurgency efforts in WWII were incredibly brutal and counterproductive and usually carried out by men who most certainly doesn't fit the picture of the beautiful, blonde Waffen-SS man fighting for Fuhrer und Vaterland. In the end, this episode of Deadliest Warrior only reinforces the stereotypes of the VC and the Waffen-SS that is spread in the popular memory of these two combatants as well as what is commonly said in military forums throughout the Internet. The men and women who fought in the VC and their efforts are not to be generalized and should be treated with the same amount of complexity that the war itself deserves. Unfortunately, I have yet to see a depiction of this anywhere outside of academia.\n\nI would be very happy to answer questions on what I've written above or on the topic in general.",

As always, if you see any errors, please let me know so I can fix them and learn from my mistakes. Scholars of the Americas, feel free to add information from your areas of research.\n\nHere we go, one last time…\n\n**The Myth: Contact Could Only Result in Native American Destruction**\n\nOf all the myths of conquest, the Terminal Narrative may be the most pervasive. In the Terminal Narrative, the trajectory of Native American history is fundamentally altered after Columbus set foot on San Salvador. Contact marks the beginning of the end, an event horizon after which history could only flow on one inevitable and completely destructive course. The end is assured, the die is cast, and existing Native American populations lived on borrowed time, doomed to die fighting a lost cause. The Terminal Narrative permeates nearly every popular analysis of Native American history, prejudices our interpretation of events after contact, and replaces discussion of agency and autonomy with notions of superiority or condescending pity for a people vanishing from the earth. As we have seen throughout the series, the reality was far more complex.\n\nIn the past the notion that primitive peoples would always fall before the sword of the civilized supported the Terminal Narrative. When overt academic racism became faux pas the reasoning shifted. Native Americans lacked key technological innovations, and were therefore overcome by a more advanced race across the sea, a people armed with writing, steel, and firearms. The narrative of course ignored evidence of Native American writing systems, the limited utility of steel when facing overwhelming odds and a determined resistance, a rich indigenous oral history, and the actual ineffectiveness of early firearms in the New World. Nevertheless, intelligence triumphed over barbarism, and Europeans spread across the globe. \n\nHidden in this narrative is the notion that the fault lies with the conquered, that the colonized were doomed for replacement because they weren’t smart enough to invent the tools needed for their own survival. Diamond himself mixes condescending pity, ignorance of Native American history/racism, and blame together quite perfectly when he states\n\n&gt; we find it hard to avoid the conclusion that Atahuallpa “should” have been more suspicious, if only his society had experienced a broader range of human behavior… not only did Atahuallpa have no conception of the Spaniards themselves, and no personal experience of any other invaders from overseas, but he also had not even heard (or read) of similar threats to anyone else, anywhere else, anytime previously in history. (p. 80)\n\n[Tawantinsuyu](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Inca-expansion.png) was the largest empire in the Americas. The Inca managed, through a combination of diplomacy and wars of conquest, to incorporate diverse cultures from Colombia to Chile, from the Pacific Coast to the Amazon Basin. To patronizingly suggest their ignorance of other cultures led to their demise is laughable. Check out /u/snickeringshadow’s analysis of [Collison at Cajamarca](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/) for a more in-depth reply to this specific chapter because I’m just getting riled up. \n\nToday, the idea of technological or racial superiority still creeps in, but disease mortality has emerged as the preeminent theme in the Terminal Narrative. The Death by Disease Alone post presented a far more complex story of population decline, and the Pristine, Uninhabited Eden post showed the slow, tenuous advancement of colonists, and their decedents, across North America. Here, we’ll address the Terminal Narrative that contextualizes the story of Native America in terms of eventual defeat, and biases our interpretation of the past. \n\n**The Reality: A Discussion Plagued by Silos of Knowledge and Creeping Determinism**\n\nThe popular narrative, influenced by major popular nonfiction works and almost every textbook ever printed, uses 1492 as a dividing line to denote irrevocable change in the Americas. As we mentioned in previous posts, recounting Native American history from a European perspective reinforces the idea of European actors and Native American reactors. This tendency defines Native American history only as it relates to European interests, and strips indigenous populations of autonomous actions independent of colonists. In the Native Desolation post we saw how the notion of an irrevocable break at contact failed to reflect the experience of people like the Maya, for whom conquest was simply a small blip in their larger perspective of history. Populations in Spanish missions continued to express autonomy and agency where we least expected to see independence. The Pristine, Uninhabited Eden and Completed Conquest posts showed the protracted nature of conquest, and how the successes of colonial enterprises resulted from centuries of conflict and negotiation.\n\nIf all this evidence of vibrant populations exists, why do we still have a Terminal Narrative? To understand the Terminal Narrative we need to investigate both how we explore the past, as well as the biases in constructing the history of the New World. Much of the confusion and misunderstanding surrounding Native American history can be traced to the division of information within academic departments, and our failure as a discipline to educate the public on revolutions in the field. Finally, a key aspect in the formation of the terminal narrative is the influence of hindsight bias, or creeping determinism. \n\n*Silos of Knowledge, or Why Absence of Evidence is Not Evidence of Absence* \n\nDeep divisions between disciplines contribute to the formation of an academic dead space surrounding Native American history after contact. Traditionally, historical investigations of the Americas begin with the arrival of *entradas* and the emergence of a paper trail of letters, tax records, and diaries. This focus on the written record, and the Europeans composing the record, continues throughout the colonial period. When written texts do exist to bridge the protohistoric gap, like Mesoamerican histories that detail centuries before contact, few have been translated to English. Added to the prehistory/history division is a traditional distrust of indigenous ethnohistorical sources and oral tradition, but thankfully this bias is lessening of late.\n\nA deep separation likewise exists within archaeology where the bulk of investigations focus either on solidly Native American populations before the arrival of Europeans (prehistoric archaeology), or the archaeology of historic colonial settlements (historic archaeology). The division between history and anthropology, the separation of two schools of knowledge, and the use of contact as a dividing line in academic pursuits dramatically influences both investigations of the past, as well as the narrative those investigations create. As Wilcox states in *The Pueblo Revolt and the Mythology of Conquest*\n\n&gt; Generally, historians have emphasized the period of contact as a historical moment in which the pre-Columbian or Indigenous past is segregated professionally and theoretically from the advent of Western history. The practical result of these profession divisions is that Indians effectively disappear when archaeological investigations end and historical studies begin. (p. 14) \n\nThese deep divisions both between, and within, disciplines reinforce contact as a point of no return. One must actually transfer between departments, alter methods, utilize different theory and evidence when shifting between the silos of knowledge. The number of interdisciplinary scholars capable of working between disciplines increased in the last few decades, but the repercussions of that separation continue to influence popular history. Practically, the creation of an academic dead space is reflected in a lack of scholarship bridging the disciplines, and therefore a lack of popular history that tells the story of the protohistoric period. This process becomes a recursive feedback loop. Lack of academic studies -&gt; lack of popular media -&gt; lack of popular interest -&gt; satisfaction with simple answers/myths of conquest -&gt; lack of academics entering the field -&gt; lack of academic studies -&gt; rinse and repeat. \n\nWe can little fault a popular narrative that interprets a lack of popular history on Native Americans after contact as evidence of their absence from the historical record. When faced with academic silence, the natural assumption is that Native American history ceases to be important. They must be doomed to die, because no one discusses how they lived. \n\nDuring the chaos of a gigantic /r/AskHistorians [AMA on the Americas](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2pa7hf/civilizations_of_the_precolumbian_americas/), several of my fellow Americas scholars lamented in IRC that we always seem to field the same questions. There is a wealth of academic knowledge accumulating about Native American history, but very little is making its way into the public consciousness where myths continue to dominate discussion. As historians on reddit we have the unique opportunity to engage the public, and on /r/badhistory we have a specific forum to directly address the common misconceptions of our respective fields. This series is an attempt bridge a tiny portion of that gap between academia and public history, to highlight the fascinating complexity of the Americas after contact.\n\n*Creeping Determinism*\n\nCreeping determinism, “the sense that grows on us, in retrospect, that what has happened was actually inevitable” (Gladwell), influences every investigation of the past. Ignorance of the period and acceptance of simple myths allows creeping determinism to shape how we discuss the history of the Americas, making the end seem inescapable.\n\nBut it didn’t have to unfold this way. \n\n&gt; It is conceivable that things might have been different. There could have arisen a polyglot Floridian Republic, a Francophone Mississippian America, a Hispanic New Biscay, a Republic of the Great Lakes, a Columbia- comprising the present Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Only if we assume a God-given drive toward geopolitical unity on the North American continent would this retrojection be meaningless. (Wolf, p.6)\n\nEuropeans entered a dynamic system with populations changing, growing, collapsing, dispersing, coalescing, making war, and negotiating peace. Colonial survival was not guaranteed. There are an infinite number of “what ifs” hidden under the hindsight bias of a terminal narrative. At every step along the way both the Europeans and Native Americans realized that conquest was a “close-run thing” (Restall). We do a disservice to the history of the New World when we assume there was only one possible way to arrive at this place and time.\n\nI struggled with how to end this post. There is much more to say, but I guess this will do…\n\n&gt; it is only when we integrate our different kinds of knowledge that the people without history emerge as actors in their own right. When we parcel them out among the several disciplines, we render them invisible-their story which is our story, vanishes from sight. (Wolf)\n\nI hope these posts sparked your interest in the time period, and provided sources for you to dig deeper. Going forward, remember the best method for combating the myths of conquest is with an interdisciplinary approach combining archaeology, history, oral tradition, and cultural anthropology to fold all the available evidence together into a complete narrative. That is how we uncover the truly fascinating history hiding beneath the myths of conquest.\n\nThanks for taking this journey with me.\n\n**For More Info**\n\nHamilton et al. 2014. “Crash and rebound of indigenous populations in lowland South America.”\n\nMcSweeney and Arps. 2005. “A ‘demographic turnaround’: the rapid growth of the indigenous populations in Lowland Latin America.”\n\nRestall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*\n\nShoemaker *American Indian Population Recovery in the Twentieth Century*\n\nWilcox *The Pueblo Revolt and the Mythology of Conquest: An Indigenous Archaeology of Contact*\n\nWolf *Europe and the People Without History*\n\nThanks to /u/snickeringshadow for help phrasing the notion of a recursive feedback loop, and thanks to /u/400-Rabbits for insight on the sources available for protohistoric Mesoamerica.

        "text": "This is a pretty old comment I found, but I was reading this article: http://www.tofugu.com/2010/03/22/the-history-of-kanji/ and found this in the comment section, I am not even sure if it belongs in /r/badlinguistics or /r/badhistory because there's a lot of bad going on here. But I wrote out this long explanation, so it is going here.\n\n---------------\nBottom line, many years ago everyone was Chinese. When the Countries declared independence from the Empire, smarter heads prevailed and both Korea and Japan got Alphabets. Good move. It also means they needed to drop the tonal speech.\n\nChinese could never have an alphabet until they drop the damn tones. Until then these evil Characters (sigh...Start at 5,000.... Geek out at 50,000+) must be learned.\n\nMeanwhile, the Koreans took the Chinese language, rejigged the Grammar for a more Confuscian Subject-Object-Verb (often no \"I\" needed, like Japanese) and just turned the tonal words into non tonal...\n\nEg. 정통 (jeon tong)= 传统 (chuan2tong3) ＝ Tradition/Traditional\n\nGuess which one is easier to read? The former has about 14 letters in their alphabet... the latter..*facepalm..\n\nOn the other hand, the former has about 40million people (80 if you count the North), the latter is spoken by about 2 billion people worldwide. So guess which one is going to land you that next job? \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nTo begin with, the quote about the tones is ridiculous. Vietnamese has worked perfectly well using a roman system, and that's to say nothing of Pinyin, which might not be the perfect system, but it works. \n\nNow to work down through the comment:\n\n&gt;many years ago everyone was Chinese\n\nJapan has never been part of China, and there have been people in Japan since the Paleolithic era, long before there was any semblence of what became modern China. The earliest known artifacts from Japan are dated to about 30,000BC. [A Rundown of the Japanese Paleolithic Period](http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/palaeol.html) To move a little further in history, the Founding Myth and first Emperor of Japan is said to be Emperor Jimmu, and his ascension to the throne is supposed to date to around 660 BC. Now this may be a legend, but we certainly know there were people at this time and [here is a jar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dmon_period#mediaviewer/File:JarWithSpiralsFinalJomonKamegaokaStyle.jpg) from the Final Jomon period which is 1,000-300BC. \n\nAs seen in the Book of the Later Han (A Chinese court document covering the history of the Han Dynasty), the first official Chinese ambassader to go to Japan happened in 57AD and that is when they gave the [King of Na Gold Seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Na_gold_seal) to Japan. \n\nAs for Korea, I am not an expert in Korean history, which is complicated by their much more extensive, closer and older interactions with China. But we do also have Pottery from ~3,500BC, [Here is a picture from the National Museum of Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeulmun_pottery_period#mediaviewer/File:Korea-Neolithic.age-Pot-01.jpg) which is fairly distinct from Chinese pottery. Most importantly, whether or not the Gojoseon State was founded by someone from China, and the Jin state was a coherent state or not, the dominant ethnic group here was Korean, and they spoke Proto-Korean, not Chinese (of which the Korean language is not related to). Which is a nice segue into the language part: \n\n(The Chinese Emperor may have thought he was King of the known world, but that doesn't mean Japanese and Korean people didn't exist as a separate entity)\n\n&gt;Both Korea and Japan got Alphabets. Good move. It also means they needed to drop the tonal speech.\n\nThe first and most important part here is that Japanese and Korean are not related to Chinese. The writing system from Chinese was imported into both Japan and Korea, in Japan ~6th century AD, in Korea probably around the 5th Century via the spread of Buddhism and the [Thousand Character Classic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Character_Classic). But a writing system does not equal a language.\n\nNow with this importation of the Hanzi into Korean and Japanese, we do see Sino vocabulary imported into both Korean and Japanese, however, the tones never existed because they simply made Korean and Japanese approximations of the sounds and nothing more. Heck, if you take his theory that both Japanese and Korean came from Chinese, then it would've been Old Chinese which didn't even have tones anyway. \n\nNow on to the Alphabets, Hangul was created in the 15th Century, in the early part of the Joseon dynasty. However, the Joseons come after the Goryeo which were not China, so I am not sure how he ties this into \"declaring independence from China.\" While Hangul has had its ups and downs over the past 600 years, it didn't become \"official\" until the late 19th century (and didn't become popular at all until say the mid 18th century), Hanja (the Chinese characters) were pretty much a requirement if you wanted to be fully literate. \n\nAs far as the Japanaese \"alphabet\" started as soon as the importation of the Kanji with the Manyogana where Chinese characters were used phonetically, and that became the Kana. But until 1900 the same sound could be represented multiple ways, so, that's confusing.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, the Koreans took the Chinese language\n\nSee above\n\n&gt;rejigged the Grammar for a more Confuscian Subject-Object-Verb (often no \"I\" needed, like Japanese) \n\nWhether a language is SOV or SVO has nothing to do with whether or not you can drop \"I\" or other pronouns. But I don't even know how this relates to being Confucian at all, nor was Korean or Japanese ever SVO. ",

        "text": "Let's talk about [Richard Wagner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRU1AJsXN1g). More specifically, let's talk about [this comment](http://i.imgur.com/lB8sIU6.png) someone made with regards to on Mr. Richard Wagner. Even more specifically, let's look at:\n\n&gt; They had that Wagner guy writing some rocking tunes somewhere behind them while they went about trying to take over the world.\n\nGötterdämmerung it! This is bad history, plain and Sigmund! They're trying to pull a Faust one, but I won't stand Thor it!\n\nThe Nazis - and Hitler especially - liked Wagner. Hitler was quoted as saying that Wagner's music embodied \"the heroic Teutonic nature,\" which is a rousing endorsement if ever I've heard one. And - let's be clear - Wagner's music was very easy for the Nazis to appropriate. You don't really have to Sach your brain to see the anti-Semitism in something like [*Die Meistersinger von Nuernberg*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg), an opera about how a young cobbler overcomes the nefarious schemings of a fellow who rather resembles some ugly Jewish stereotypes. It's an opera that saw frequent performances during the Third Reich, and one which was one of Hitler's favourites. It had evil Jews, brave Germans, and a romantic subplot. It was, for the Nazis, perfect.\n\nEqually, you don't have to Klingsor too hard to see what themes in [*Parsifal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal) might have attracted the Nazis. In *Parsifal,* we follow the titular Parsifal as he seeks the Holy Grail. Throughout the opera, there are themes of purity of blood and soul, and once again, the brave German overcomes Jewish and anti-Christian forces to bring forth a triumphant victory. Goebbels was a fan of this one, and it was performed 23 times in Berlin between 1939 and 1942.\n\nHowever, what really made Wagner stand out, and the primary reason he was so popular is that he took opera and made it German. Before Wagner, German opera wasn't necessarily a thing. While Carl Maria von Weber started the idea of operas with German themes (or *romantisch opera*), these weren't operas in the way we would recognise them. They were closer to *singspiels,* or something closer to a musical today. True opera, complete with massive sets, arias, costumes, and filled with a grandiose, high production value, was primarily Italian before Wagner. Wagner took Italian opera, and he made it German. He introduced German ideals, had the singers sing in German, told stories of German mythology, and made the heroes German. His operas are incredibly nationalistic, full of themes of Germany and German superiority.\n\nNo idea why the Nazis might have liked it.\n\nBut for the Nazis and the Germans who agreed with them, Wagner was perfect. He wrote big, grandiose, impressive music that was all about how great Germany was and how awesome Germans were as a people. In some of them, there's even anti-Semitism. Considering Wagner at one point claimed \"the German has the exclusive right to be called 'musician,'\" it's really not hard at all to see why the Nazis might have been fans.\n\nThe trouble with saying that \"that Wagner guy [was] writing some rocking tunes somewhere behind them,\" though, is simple. Wagner died of a heart attack in 1883. If he was writing music in the 1930s and 40s for the Nazis, I'll be impressed. Not surprised, really, but damned impressed. The Nazis most definitely used Wagner's music and used it gladly, but had him writing it right then and there? Not really.\n\nThat said, there were some composers writing who were undeniably Nazis, and who sort of saw themselves as successors to Wagner. [Carl Orff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Orff), for instance, was probably a Nazi, and some of his music - well, [one piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD3VsesSBsw) - gained rather a lot of popularity, though nothing close to Wagner. [Werner Egk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Egk), too, was probably a Nazi, and certainly an opportunist when it came to writing music for the Nazis to enjoy. Hitler even called him a \"worthy successor to Wagner,\" which is generally a good thing to be when you're a composer in the Third Reich. [Hans Pfitzner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Pfitzner), almost amusingly, was a big fan of the Nazis, even though they didn't like him. In any case, there were certainly composers aplenty who were writing music for the Nazis. Wagner wasn't one of them. \n\nTL;DR: [This](http://i.imgur.com/l1AB4LE.gif) was Wagner during the Third Reich.\n\nSources:\n\nI highly recommend **Composers of the Nazi Era** by Michael Kater. It's a fantastic look at the state of music during the Third Reich and what composers accomplished - or didn't accomplish - what. It's also great for understanding the general backdrop of Nazi music.\n\n[This](http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/) is also a great website, though it focuses on the Holocaust specifically rather than Nazi Germany more generally. \n\nAlso, I had a chat with /u/Mirior. That was kinda nice. He's a pretty helpful guy.",

        "text": "[This post](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2ugbg4/-/co8o7rk). Well, really, the whole thread, but this post most of all. This post really encapsulates all the bad history in the entire thread. The idea that Germans couldn't be POWs, the idea that POWs could be executed willy nilly, all of it stems from this one misunderstanding about the history of international law. \n\nIt's debated what the origin of international law is. Certainly there have been philosophers like Francisco de Vitoria and Hugo Grotius who have proposed things that have had a large influence on and which we might recognise as precursors of modern international law. Grotius' [*Mare Liberum*](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/552) certainly had a massive influence on international laws of the sea, and is still used today on the high seas, albeit in a modified form. His work [*De jure belli ac Pacis*](http://www.constitution.org/gro/djbp.htm), too, is considered a seminal work in the field of international law. Both these works were written in the early 17th century.\n\nHowever, I see the real beginning of international law lying with the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia). Signed in 1648, the treaties of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years War and the Eighty Years War. It recognised the independence of Switzerland, Bremen, and the Netherlands, but more relevantly, it established for the first time the principle of national sovereignty. National sovereignty and the idea that each state is in charge of its own affairs without interference from other states is central to international law. This views sets the relevant players in international politics not to be citizens or rulers, but rather, the state itself. It's the difference between meeting with Ferdinand III and meeting with the leader of the Holy Roman Empire - they may be the same person, but there is significance in establishing a difference between the person and the state, and establishing the state as the more important body. This is how modern law and diplomacy works (though there is some deviation from the traditional Westphalian model). \n\nFor the next few centuries, many political philosophers expanded on this idea of the state as the actor, laying out principles for what principles could and ought to govern international law. Grotius is one of the earliest and - in my opinion - more influential thinkers. Kant, too, adds a lot to international law theory in [*Zum ewigen freiden*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46873), in which he argues that a legal system that allows for war can never really have peace. It's another principle that's been heavily debated and somewhat implemented in modern law, though once again, with modifications.\n\nA good example of these sorts of principles being put in place can be found in the [Congress of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna), a meeting that occurred after the Napoleonic Wars. The Congress of Vienna restored and reshaped national boundaries, but more than that, did so with the intention of creating a more militaristically balanced Europe. Borders were redrawn with the intention of preventing future massive wars like the Napoleonic Wars. While it's questionable how effective this actually was - after all, it hardly represented an end to war in Europe - it did prevent a massive continental war for a century, which is always a plus. Moreover, the methods and make-up of the Congress of Vienna were used as the basis for future organisations, such as the League of Nations and UN.\n\nTo be clear, the Congress of Vienna was not a law-making body. It didn't have the power to make laws that would or could be enforced internationally. The first things that we can think of true international \"laws\" will come in a few decades. However, the importance of a body that was seen as having authority greater than any individual nation-state cannot be emphasised enough. It's the basis of modern international law and - more importantly - established that there could theoretically be punishments and negotiations meted out by an uninterested and uninvolved third party. \n\nBut what about law itself? I'm talking about all these bodies, but not much about actual documents. First off, it's important to understand at least a little bit about how international law works in order to understand what would have been in effect during WWII. To give a very brief primer, international law relies on two aspects - written documents that establish law (treaties and such)(this is also called \"hard law,\" and it's how I'll be referring to it) and non-binding agreements or things nations like to do (customary or \"soft\" law). Both are valid (or at least as valid as international law can be said to be), but each has their own set of punishments and systems. As an example of the difference, the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions) are an example of hard law. They're something that have been codified and which people have signed. The fact that people are still beholding to the Geneva Conventions without necessarily having signed them is an example of soft law - you have to do it because it's customary at this point to do so.\n\nIn 1863, we have the [Lieber Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieber_Code), a document signed by President Lincoln which established a code of conduct for soldiers in war. More importantly, however, it established a standard by which war crimes could be judged. Those who were in violation of the Lieber Code could be held accountable for their actions after the war by a criminal court, as was the case with [Henry Wirz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wirz#Trial_and_execution), a Confederate officer. Because of this, the Lieber Code became extremely important in two other groups of documents that are foundational in international law - the Geneva and Hague Conventions.\n\nI'll talk about the Geneva Conventions first because, well, they're older and more people know about them. The first Geneva Convention was adopted in 1864, and dealt with the treatment of wounded soldiers. It and the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies at Sea adopted in 1906 established basic codes for how soldiers needed to be treated. While only thirteen countries signed the original ten articles in 1864, by WWI, they had certainly entered into customary law. \n\nThe Hague Conventions also addressed war time conduct, though their focus was more on what weapons could and could not be used. Poison gas, for instance, was [banned](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-02.asp) in the Hague Conventions, as were exploding bullets and dropping things out of balloons on people. In 1907, they were slightly expanded, but otherwise remained more or less the same. Once again, though, the Hague Conventions were fundamental in establishing both hard and soft law regarding what could and could and could not be done. On the other hand, they were almost all violated during WWI, which is, in its own way, instrumental in the evolution of modern international law.\n\nHow was it instrumental? The atrocities and horrors of WWI led directly to the creation of an organisation that would ostensibly ensure that there was peace and happiness throughout the world forever and ever - the League of Nations. The League did more than just work out territorial disputes and international conflicts - it also helped create human rights laws, worked with refugees and displaced peoples, and tried to institute a policy of disarmament. However, by 1946, the creation of the UN meant that the League of Nations was redundant and a bit of a failure, so it was dissolved. \n\nSo then, I suppose, the question is what exactly the state of international law was when the Allies were liberating concentration camps. Ostensibly, the League of Nations had been responsible partly for enforcing international law, but this was largely a failure. However, does an inability to enforce a law necessarily mean that law is non-existent? Hardly. By 1945, most of the laws we recognise vis a vis conduct during war - especially those regarding treatment of POWs, which Nazi officers would have been - were in place. Laws regarding things you could and could not use while offing enemy soldiers were in place. International law, however chaotic the situation might have been, was most definitely in place. \n\nThis is perhaps especially well illustrated by the fact that there were war crimes tribunals - of which Nuremberg is probably the most famous - after the war ended. There were war crimes tribunals specifically people had been committing war crimes. For there to be war crimes, there must be a law that was broken. While the law was expanded to encompass new crimes and situations that had come up during WWII, the fact remains that during WWII, there was most certainly international law. It was a thing, and had been for quite some time already. ",

        "text": "According to Storyworld....well I'll just let him say it:\n\n\"This is good advice, however you are missing one key ingredient. You say the film is a 3 hour glorification of the KKK, but it's very important to put it into historical context and realize that the KKK at the time was NOT what we think of as the KKK. When slaves were freed, there were large groups of formers slaves roaming the South pillaging, raping, murdering, and burning. They were pissed off (who wouldn't be in that situation) so it does make sense why this happened. The KKK was originally formed to protect the Southern land owners that were being targeted. Yes it eventually evolved into the evil organization we now know, but at the time this story takes place it was not that organization yet.\nEdit: Oh very mature Reddit, just downvote historical facts into oblivion because you don't like what it implies. I'd love for someone here to actually try and refute what I said.\"\n\n\nhttp://www.np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2v70xd/100_years_ago_today_dw_griffiths_controversial/cof6sxp\n\nSince he so kindly asks for someone to refute what he said. I will take a stab at it.\n\nBefore we begin, I will say that there probably were some former slaves who took revenge.  However, I am not well versed in reconstruction, so someone with more info can probably help me.\n\nThe First Ku Klux Klan was not a defensive organization.  Southern whites, threatened with loss of their power, formed these Klan type groups all over the south.  Their sole purpose was to intimidate, murder, and scare blacks to limit their potential new political power.  This is in conjunction with Southern Legislators immediately passing new black codes that prohibited freedmen from having any job other than farmer, maid, or servant.  All of this was done to reassert white supremacy, not to defend helpless landowners from former slaves.  This violence prohibited Freedmen from having any political power until the Federal Government stepped in and cracked down on white landowners.  The Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Freedmen's Bureau helped establish new African American dominated legislatures.  Eventually these would be overthrown in the mid 1870s with the help of white supremacist paramilitary organizations. (The first Klan being largely defeated in 1870/1871).  The most famous example of this would be the Hamburg Massacre in South Carolina 1876.\n\nWhile the Freedmen Bureau helped, the former planters still owned the land.  And soon you have the emergence of share cropping, which usually put Freedmen into a debt cycle.  This was marginally better, but not entirely different from slavery.\n\nBut don't take my word for it that white were the aggressors and not defending from roving bands of blacks.  Read Carl Schurz's 1865 report on conditions in the South, which clearly documents the kind of terror that freed slaves were living under.\n\nhttp://www.wwnorton.com/college/history/give-me-liberty4/docs/CSchurz-South_Report-1865.pdf\n\nSources:\n\nHahn, \"Nation Under Our Feet\"\n\nBudiansky, \"The Bloody Shirt: Terror after Appomattox\" (Excellent book btw).\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#First_KKK\n\n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2v7wvw/let_give_you_a_brief_history_in_the_feminist/",
        "text": "So, yesterday, there was [a post on TheRedPill](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2v4izl/a_brief_history_on_feminism_i_am_trying_to_give/) purporting to be a “brief history on feminism”. Considering the source, and the fact that literally *everything* there could be a submission to one of many various badacademia subs, you know this is going to be good.\n\nBefore we get started, I’d like to remind you that **we will remove posts that delve into modern gender politics**, as per R2. You all know where the line is. \n\nMuch of this is going to American-centric. That’s the author’s focus, so I’m going to focus on that. Feel free to add on to this R5, however. \n\n&gt; The family structure was very strong and everyone was happy (despite the short hard lives).\n\n[Really? REALLY?](http://i.imgur.com/JzxyMf9.jpg) \n\nWow. Literally, like, holy shit. We’re only a few sentences in (excluding that stupidly long intro about how “this is not for women’s ears” and how they “don’t need their [women’s] input”), and we just erased the entire [history of the labor movement](http://www.history.com/topics/labor). Upton Sinclair’s *The Jungle*? Didn’t real, apparently. Knights of Labor? Nope. Samuel Gompers (and not our Gompers, the historical Gompers)? Nuh uh. You know that [Haymarket Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair), where someone threw a bomb during a labor demonstration, leading to a shootout and the deaths of four people? Apparently did not exist anymore! Efforts to end child labor? Nahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Everyone was perfectly happy about their lives and had absolutely no complaints!\n\n&gt; American (and other countries, I’m sure, but this isn’t about them. It is about us) families worked on farms to produce food to eat and not die. Grandfather lived inside because he was too old to work anymore, Dad and two Uncles lived there (or very close) and worked the farm. \n\nUrban workers apparently don’t exist in this idyllic universe.\n\n&gt; On a side note, homosexuality did not exist. Yes, there were men that were attracted to other men, but they did an act, they were not “gay.” What I mean is that they were not defining their life or their identity by what they did. Yeah, Joe down the street fucked Billy, and nobody knew it, but this was not a gay man, he was a man that worked a farm or sold shit or whatever, he just happened to fuck dudes. \n\n[We started to classify sexual orientation by the 1860s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation#Early_classification_schemes) In addition, [sexology (as an academic discipline) came about sometime in the 1880s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexology#Sexology_as_an_academic_discipline). If we’re talking about the sub-culture, we start seeing such an emergence [by the 19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_history#Male_ideal_and_the_19th_century) and the early 20th century.\n\nI will admit that I’m not as familiar with this era of history than I’d like. I’m pretty sure there are people hanging about who might know more about the history regarding sexual identity in the US than I do, so please, add comments!\n\n&gt; My point in this was that we as men, straight men, hung out with guys all the time. \n\n… if you’re going to argue that there was no concept of “homosexual”, you can’t then claim that there was a concept of “straight” or “heterosexual” either. That’s not how it works.\n\n&gt; In fact, if you look at a lot of the pictures when they became a mainstream thing, they were pics of men with their best friends and they would hold hands, or put their hands on each other in intimate ways. Not gay ways, as sexuality had nothing to do with it. This is because the male bod was very strong. Now that fags are hear, we have this fear of it, so we don’t want to be associated with anything that could appear gay. This new era kind of ruined the male brotherhood and turned it into “bromance” or other fag assed things. We have changed quite a bit over the years, hacking away at what male bonding is.\n\n… no comment. Any commentary about this section will violate R2.\n\n&gt; flash forward to the industrial revolution. (Despite being so hard and lots of deaths, it was a much much much better situation for all).\n\n\\*points to the section about the labor movement* Uh huh.\n\n&gt; The only problem with it was this; Dad now goes to work in the factory and leaves all of his kids at home. So, for 12 or so hours a day, where you used to be able to talk with your father, your dad is now at work.\n\nAnd now we just erased the history of working women and children! Apparently, women never had to go out and work, which is why the [Lowell and Lawrence textile factories relied on young women to work on their mills during the 19th century](http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/ww/mills.html). *The Jungle* features women working in the canning industry. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory was staffed by young immigrant women, and [the people who died in that famous fire were women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire). Also, in this universe, child labor just never happened. I’m guessing they never paid any attention to class, or even did [a basic Google image search for pictures of children working in factories or in coal mines](https://www.google.com/search?q=child+labor+industrial+revolution&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch)\n\n&gt; So, who is teaching you all day? Your mom! She is raising you more than before, because dads are now in factories working.\n\nBesides the whole “WOMEN NEVER WORKED IN FACTORIES” and “CHILD LABOR DID NOT EXIST” thing (ahahahaha, no), [there were public schools by the late 18th century, and we started to see compulsory schooling laws in the late 19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_the_United_States#Growth_of_public_schools). In fact, [Horace Mann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Mann) introduced various reforms, such as teacher training schools and pushing for the Prussian system of teaching. So, in all likelihood, you might have been sent to a public school to get your education rather than being taught by Mom.\n\nI’m skipping the rest because it’s mostly baseless misogynistic tripe about women and how women are raising men to not be men because they don’t know what they want and what women really want is an alpha dark triad male but all she gets are nice guys and blah blah blah blah blah.\n\nOh, also, racism. Because we have to shoehorn racism. \\*groans*\n\nHilariously enough, though, there isn’t any talk about the history of feminism. Now I’m sad. ",

It's essentially useless as a map and almost impossible to critique because it looks like someone just took a map of Europe and Asia and use the spraypaint tool from Microsoft Paint on it. \n\nThe second image, labeled \"Crusade Battles\" is easier to critique, because of how laughably wrong it is. The Crusades, by most measurements, covered a 200-400-year period, covering the nine generally-recognized Crusades. If the Crusades are broadened to include the Baltic Crusades and the Reconquista, the last Crusade ended with the conquest of Grenada in 1492. Yet according to Mr. ~~D'Snooza~~ D'Souza, the Crusaders fought only thirteen battles over the centuries. The map doesn't include the locations of many notable battles, such as the capture of Constantinople by the Venetians in the Fourth Crusade. It omits the Baltic Crusade and the Reconquista entirely. \n\nIt should be obvious to anyone looking at the maps that they weren't meant to illustrate medieval battles but to score cheap political points by deliberately mis-representing history to present all Muslims as conquering barbarians and Crusaders as peaceful defenders of Western civilization.",

These skills have long sense been forgotten but the Danish archer Lars Anderson is trying to reinvent what has been lost.\"\n\nOh god. This is going to be so rough on my liver. \n\nI should also make note that, at this point, Lars is shooting a bow while sticking his leg though it. Truly a lost art that was essential to past archers.\n\n********************\n\n[00:17]\n\nNow we get into the baseless claims that:\n\n1. Holding arrows in the draw hand was once widespread\n\n2. It is somehow the apex of archery skill\n\nTo support this he brings up a picture of a Syrian archer (obviously representative of every historical use of the bow) and a quote from *Arab Archery* (which he calls the most extensive book ever written on the subject.)\n\nThe quote he uses seems like it actually supports his point pretty well.\n\n&gt;This is the best type of shooting and there is nothing beyond it in power or accuracy, and no one can manage to do it except a person who has trained himself in it and has obtained mastery in it and also in horsemanship.\n\nNow lets add context.\n\n&gt;Others said that Kisra once ordered Bustam to shoot a lion in his presence. One arrow, however, failed to kill the beast, and Kisra exclaimed that an arrow was not a satisfactory weapon; unlike a sword with which one can strike one blow after another, or a spear with which one can thrust repeatedly… The interval between each two shots might endanger the safety of the warrior or the hunter. Bustam gave thought to the matter and subsequently devised the shower or successive shooting, with five, ten, or fifteen arrows, all held at the same time in the archer’s hand. They are shot one after the other in rapid succession thereby rendering the bow and arrow superior to the sword and spear… Al-Tabari said that he himself had shot in this fashion fifteen arrows, one after the other in rapid succession. **This is the best type of shooting and there is nothing beyond it in power or accuracy, and no one can manage to do it except a person who has trained himself in it and has obtained mastery in it and also in horsemanship.** The kings of Persia were wont to take children and teach it to them, rewarding those who mastered it and punishing those who did not.\n\nSo who are these actors that claim holding arrows in the archers hand is the best way to **hunt**? (Hunt is bolded because Lars seems to be under the impression that there is one singular way to shoot a bow that is best for every single situation.)\n\n * Kisra - A mythological figure\n\n * Bustam - Another mythological figure\n\nThe Secondary source he sources seems to be making a pretty wild claim based on some not so trustworthy primary sources. It makes no attempt to explain how or why holding the arrows in your draw hand somehow increases the power and accuracy of your bow. Also, **power**? Really? The only way to get more power out of a bow is by overdrawing (bad form and bad for the bow) or by getting a new bow with a higher draw weight.\n \n\nIt should also be noted that the Source *Arab Archery* is a manuscript written in the 1500's about Arab Archery. It's not representative of every culture's use of the bow.\n\n*******************************\n\n[00:35]\n\n*Lars fires multiple shots in quick succession while half drawing a 25 lb bow 8 ft from his target.*\n\n&gt; But the big question is, \"Why has it been forgotten today?\"\n\nThe method of shooting Lars demonstrates is so useless that it deserves to be forgotten.\n\n******************************\n\n[00:51]\n\n*A normally agile Lars drops his arrows while running through the forest.*\n\n&gt; Surprisingly, the quiver turned out to be useless when it came to moving fast.\n\nWell yea. \n\n&gt; The back quiver is a Hollywood myth and was not common in the past. But is still spread all over the world. Why? Because modern archers do not move.\n\nThis demonstrates a weird bias in what Lars determines to be the purpose of archery. I think he is projecting his own style of trick shooting into the past and assuming that that is the most efficient style of shooting. The idea that European archers used back quivers is actually a Hollywood myth. But there are plenty of examples of back quivers being used in other cultures from the Native Americans, to the Japanese, to Africans, to the Mongols.\n\n&gt;They stand still, firing at a target board; something that was unknown in the past.\n\nComplete and utter bullshit.\n\n&gt; These archers also starting placing the arrow on the left side of the bow... This is probably due to the fact that aiming at stationary two dimensional target makes you aim with one eye instead of two.\n\nDoes Lars understand the basics of Archery? Which ever side of the bow that the arrow is placed on is completely dependent on the archers dominant hand and eye.\n\n******************************\n\n[01:30]\n\n&gt; Lars discovered that some historical archers held their arrows on the right side of the bow.\n\n**Breaking News: Lars has discovered left handed or left eye dominant humans!!**\n\n***************************\n\n[01:50]\n\n&gt;Lars discovered that what we think of as historical archery only works well for modern target archery and film.\n\n*drinks*\n\nArchery was never a cohesive practice with a guidebook. The style of Archery can be completely different depending on what the circumstances demand of it. I guarantee you that a European long-bowman would not be doing gymnastics on the front line of battle.\n\nYes, our conception of archery is imperfect but it's not a lot better than the understanding that people watching this video are left with.\n\n************************\n\n*Lars fills approximately 2 minutes of video time doing a bunch of flashy bullshit and making inaccurate claims about the needed skills of past archers.*\n\n******************************\n\n[03:38]\n\nHere Lars presents us with the tech tree of archery, he manages to simplify the use of bow and arrow thought history into a few simple stages.\n\n1. Simple minded archers naively use quivers\n\n2. Archers of the world simultaneously level up to holding arrows in their bow hand\n\n3. Archers learn to hold arrows in their draw hand\n\n4. ~~The firearm class of weapons rises up to abolish the Archer's monopoly of violence~~\n\n5. ~~The Firearm state slowly melts away leaving an egalitarian society where all members share the means of violence.~~\n\n\n***************************************\n\n*More flashy bullshit ensues*\n\n***********************\n\n[4:45]\n\n&gt; In the past archers allegedly used both hands to give the arrow more power\n\n\nI'm having a lot of trouble understanding what he means by this because archers already use both hands, and their back, and their arms. Surely not using both hands on the string. That would be impractical in almost every situation I can think of and would be useless because you are supposed to be able to draw your bow to the draw length with one hand. The only thing I can imagine is some poor sod being given the crappy bow that has a draw strength of 200 pounds and being forced to shoot arrows sitting on his ass pulling against his feet.\n\n*************************\n\nHe wraps it up with the splitting an arrow trick which, to his credit, he does not claim to have any use or even be possible when the target arrow isn't made out of bamboo or a similar strait grained wood.\n\nThose were some cool trick shots but I'm mad that he used bad history to garner over 25 million youtube views.",

The Dresden bombing was part of a larger campaign to hamper German troop movement from the Eastern front and aid Soviet advance by targeting transportation centers which were already being heavily taxed by refugees. \n\nA British intelligence report on January 25, stated: \n\n&gt;[Soviet success depends on] the result of a race between the arrival of German reserves …and the loss\nof the Russian advance owing to logistic difficulties and the distraction of forces\non the flanks.” \n\nThis is where Dresden comes in.  Besides being an military industrial center, Dresden was a very important railroad junction for both north-south and east-west rail routes. No less than three trunk routes ran through Dresden. This is why Arthur Harris recommended Dresden be targeted, along with Leipzig, Chemnitz and Berlin.  On January 31, the Anglo-American plan had been finalized in the words of Carl Spaatz: \n\n&gt;[to target]cities where heavy attack will cause great confusion in civilian evacuation from the East and hamper movement of reinforcements from other fronts.\n\nNow that is pretty horrific when you cut away the bureaucratic veneer but it damn well isn't \"punitive\".  \n\n&gt; destroyed a great city and hundred of thousands of civilians (many of them refugees from all over Eastern Europe).\n\nAnd here David Irving rears his ugly little head.  The idea of 100,000+ casualties is pure bullshit born from Joseph Goebbels and reiterated by delighted little nazi-apologists everywhere (and Kurt Vonnegut).  There were 21,271 registered burials following the raid and historians generally agree that somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000 people ultimately died, mostly within a area of eight squares of the old city.  \n\n&gt; It was in February of 1945 and it was completely clear at that point that the Allies would defeat Germany.\n\nWell first off, it fucking wasn't, because they didn't live in the future.  The Ardennes Offensive had completely thrown off any Allied expectations regarding the war's end.  A January 16 memorandum by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee noted the \"probable worst-case scenario\" had the Allies being completely stopped until August 1945.  Five days later, a US Army Air force reported stated that not only had the allies lost the initiative in the west, but that the Luftwaffe had recovered \"to a degree not considered possible by Allied intelligence some\neight months ago.\"  That was the atmosphere in which the Allies decided to do to Dresden what they had done to Hamburg, Cologne, Darmstadt, Pforzheim, Wuerzburg, Freiburg, Stutgart... you get the picture.\n\nBut to take it further, why should it matter that Germany was clearly defeated?  In what world should the Allies have taken the proverbial foot off the gas pedal?  Dresden was bombed in February 1945.  In that month , the United States alone lost 49,689 casualties. The war may have been \"winding down\", but those men were just as dead as those killed in '41 or '42.  Anne Frank was still alive in February 1945 for fuck's sake. The camp where she died, Bergen-Belsen, was liberated two months to the day after Dresden.  Two months.  60 more days of industrial genocide.   \nI see this attitude pop up again and again on Reddit and it frustrates me so much. This idea that the Allies should have \"let up\". If they want to blame someone they should be blaming the Nazi leadership for continuing a war they had clearly lost, and not the Allies for ending it.  Ugh. Well on that note, Happy Saturday!",

        "text": "[The bad History in question.](http://www.kensingtonrunestone.us)\n\nThe Kensington Rune-Stone is a a supposed Rune-Stone of Norse origin found in Minnesota by a farmer around the turn of the century, that tells the tale of a Norse voyage to North America. The rune-stone describes a voyage of about 30 Swedish and Norwegian explorers that traveled through Hudson Bay to Minnesota. Ten members of the crew were found dead and the renaming crew members set off to return to Vinland. The stone was written in a unusual form of old Swedish and was found by Olof Ohman buried in mud on his farm in Minnesota. A quote from the bad history:\n\n&gt;Many of the scholarly culprits of the past have been linguists. They proclaimed that there were runes on the stone that didn’t exist in the language in 1362, and so therefore the stone must be a hoax, which is to say it was carved by Olof Ohman. But then new discoveries of medieval runes in Europe dating to the correct period would emerge. Suddenly the tables are turned - how could a farmer have known about these runes decades before the academics discovered them?\n\nThe key issue with the Rhinestones language is not just that it is  \"“a jumble of Swedish and Norwegian in late grammatical forms with here and there an English word, but all spelled in runic characters\" but that the strange runes match perfectly the errors in a book owned by the Ohman family. Some of the errors are described below:\n&gt;Secondly, there are several forms of words that look very odd. Among other things, Medieval Swedish still had per- son and number inflections on verbs, but on the Kensing- ton Rune Stone only singular verb forms appear. This is in- deed a feature of some Swedish texts from the fourteenth century, although these are very rare. Old Swedish of the kind supposedly used on the Kensington Rune Stone would also have had case inflection, with special forms of nouns after prepositions. The preposition ve(d) “by” took the dative case, and thus we expect a form vid hafinu for “by the sea”, rather than the “modern” version ve(d) havet (Wahlgren, 1958: 112-113).\n\nMany of these errors can be identified from a single page in a book owned b the Ohman family:\n&gt;The encyclopaedia The Well-Informed Schoolmaster by Carl Rosander (or: Den kunskapsrike skolmästaren, eller Hufvudgrunderna uti de för eft borgerligt samfundslif nö- digaste vetenskaper), in its third edition of 1882, is docu- mented as being part of the library of the Ohman house- hold. The first part of this book covers the history of the Swedish language, with information on Viking Age runes and tongue, as well as information about Old Swedish and older Swedish dialects. \n\nand\n\n&gt;Very little content beyond that of page 64 in Rosander is required to identify all of the anomalies or oddities of the Kensington Rune Stones’ inscriptions.\n\nThis argument is the key feature of what the Kensington Rune stone is a fake, is that all of the strange conventions of the writing can be explained by the errors in a single page of text in a book owned by the individual that discovered the stone. The alternative explanation is that a unique blend of Swedish/Norwegian formed by the explores would have to include a new form of writing, conventions from multiple dialects of Swedish and somehow include phrasing that has not been found before the 1700's. \n\nTo answer the question posed above, \"The Well Informed Schoolmaster\" provides the evidence that the farmer would of known about the Runes in the same form as the Rune stone. On that argument the Kensington Rune Stone cannot be claimed to be a authentic artifact and can be at best be regarded as intriguing and at worst out-right fraud. \n\nSources: \nTikkanen, Karin Westin. \"The Consequences of Truth.\" Bulletin of the History of Archaeology 22.1 (2012): n. pag.

We are moving north in the later posts in the series and I will focus mostly on my areas of expertise in North America. As always, if you see any errors, let me know so I can fix them and learn from my mistakes. Scholars of the Americas, feel free to add information from your areas of research.\n\nHere we go…\n\n**The Myth: A Pristine, Uninhabited Eden**\n\nPer the Myth of a Pristine Eden, few Native Americas lived in the New World at the time of contact. Worse versions of the myth hold that inhabited areas, though few and far between, were home to nomadic groups who did little to modify the natural environment. For those who believe the New World was richly populated at contact, but also hold to the uninhabited Eden myth, catastrophic population decline due to disease is often blamed for winnowing Native Americans population before wide-spread colonization. The Myth of a Pristine Eden explains, and excuses, the apparent rapid movement of European colonists across the North America. Like the Death by Disease Alone myth, the Myth of a Pristine Eden allows for the flawed, simple answer to ignorance of Native American history by assuming their absence from the story of North America.\n\n**The Reality: A System in Motion, Obscured by Cliff’s Notes Version of History**\n\nWe’ve encountered elements of the Myth of a Pristine Eden myth in previous posts. Popular films often utilize the trope of a virgin, peaceful populace inhabiting a land largely unaltered by their presence. The notion of initial purity contrasts nicely with the Myth of Native Desolation in response to oppression, defeat, and catastrophic population decline. Visions of innocent Native Americans with their nonexistent societies emerged early in European accounts. Vespucci stated, in 1502, that Native Americans “have no property; instead all things are held in community… They live without king and without any form of authority, and each one is his own master” as they lived “in agreement with nature”. Those seeking to promote English colonial enterprises in New England likewise emphasized the natural bounty of this New World, while stressing the absence of original inhabitants. \n\nThe popular narrative inherited the myth of a New World paradise of abundance, while ignoring the tremendous effort and planning required to extract those resources. Exaggeration of the richness of New England reached comical levels early in colonial history, and required a /r/badistory-worthy tongue-in-cheek response. In 1628 Captain Christopher Levett wrote\n\n&gt; I will not tell you that you may smell the corn field before you see the land; neither must men think that corn doth grow naturally, (or on trees,) nor will the deer come when they are called, or stand still and look on a man until he shoot him… nor the fish leap into the kettle, nor on the dry land, neither are they so plentiful, that you may dip them up in baskets… which is no truer than that the fowls will present themselves to you with spits through them. (quoted in Cronon)\n\nCaptain Levett had good reason to preach caution. Early English colonists, drunk on tales of natural abundance, and gold-hungry, refused to labor to store food during the brief times of plenty, only to starve to death once the snows fell. In a land reputed to be Eden, more than half the original founders of Plymouth died the first winter. Inhabitants of [Jamestown resorted to cannibalism](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/starving-settlers-in-jamestown-colony-resorted-to-cannibalism-46000815/?no-ist) during Starving Time in the winter of 1609, and were in the process of abandoning the settlement when the new governor arrived with supplies in 1610. \n\nOn the other extreme, racist stereotypes of Native Americans abandon this romanticization, stating the New World was “unused and undeveloped…life was nasty, brutish, and short” with conquest bringing “an objectively superior culture” (The Ayn Rand Institute, quoted in Restall). This is the same racism/ignorance we touched on in the Myth of Miscommunication where [Aztecs couldn’t adapt to Spanish battle tactics](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2pa7hf/civilizations_of_the_precolumbian_americas/cmuya21), thought [cavalry were centaurs](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/268f4u/where_the_centaurs_really_based_on_the/chpklxk), and [Cortés was Quetzalcoatl](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rgsfl/is_there_any_truth_to_the_commonly_cited_fact/cdn7avv). An in-depth consideration of the abundant evidence of dense population settlements, monumental architecture, complex cultures, and a thoroughly utilized landscape in the New World is beyond the scope of this post. However, I am loathe to leave such drivel unanswered. \n\nWhen Columbus encountered a New World, the cyclic pattern of consolidation and dispersal accompanying Southeastern paramount chiefdoms [like Cahokia](http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/images/cahokia-1150-lg.jpg) continued, as it had, for hundreds of years. The Haudenosaunee League was forming in modern day New York. Orchards lined the St. Lawrence River, and acres of maize supported large populations at the northern extreme of the plant’s range. Their golden age passed, [Pueblo Bonito](http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/21974/lightbox/Screen_shot_2013-03-06_at_10.14.42_AM.png?1362590122) in Chaco Canyon and the [Cliff Palace of Mesa Verde](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/8600000/Mesa-Verde-Cliff-Palace-united-states-of-america-8609177-800-499.jpg) already declined in use, their population spreading about the greater Southwest to regions with more reliant water sources. [Tenochtitlan](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-3/325_02_2.jpg), the seat of an expanding Triple Alliance Empire, was conservatively home to over 100,000 people. Túpac Inca finished his wars of conquest, incorporated the Kingdom of Chimor, and [extended the borders of an empire ranging from modern-day Ecuador to Chile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire#mediaviewer/File:Inca-expansion.png) that encompassed over fifteen million people. \n\nThe Myth of a Pristine Eden, combined with a terminal narrative of inevitable Native American decline, interprets 1492 as the beginning of the end for Amerindians. In truth, Europeans entered a New World teeming with dynamic populations changing, growing, collapsing, dispersing, coalescing, making war, and negotiating peace. There was no guarantee that any colonial outpost, not Spanish nor Portuguese nor English nor French nor Dutch, would succeed in the shadow of two richly inhabited continents. \n\n*A Cliff’s Notes Version of North American History*\n\nThe popular history of the United States encourages the omission of Native Americans by creating a narrative that temporally jumps from 1492 to Jamestown/Plymouth to the Revolution in the same breath. As mentioned in a previous post, the Myth of Death by Disease Alone is used as a balm to cover ignorance of Native American history in the protohistoric, while the Pristine Eden explains the seemingly unimpeded advancement of colonial enterprises. Absent from the narrative is the story of North America beyond the frontier of tiny European settlements. What follows are vignettes, by no means exhaustive, that show the combination of factors leading to extending the frontier to the Mississippi River.\n\n* For the first century of contact the bulk of European-Native American interaction occurred in Spanish Florida and New Mexico. Ignoring this time period hides a century of Europeans fishing, exploring, and trading along the Atlantic Coast, the negotiation and rebellion in Spanish missions, and the relative stasis of populations in the southeast despite continual contact with Spanish colonial enterprises.\n\n* After a century of previous European trade and exploration along the New England coast, Plymouth colonists arrived in Massachusetts on the heels of a nasty epidemic. Population decline and pressure from inland enemies caused Massasoit, sachem of the Wampanoag, to change the traditional policy of opposing long-term European settlement. Instead of driving the colonists into the sea, he sought an alliance with Plymouth. The peace lasted a generation. When the dust settled on King Phillip’s War, the English colony barely survived. Over 3,000 Wampanoag, Nipmuck, Podunk, Narragansett, and Nashaway were dead. Native American survivors who were not confessing Christians were sold into slavery in the Caribbean. English colonists moved on to the newly emptied land.\n\n* Jamestown colonists arrived in Tsenacommacah (densely inhabited land), a large area of tidewater Virginia under the control of the Powhatan mamanatocik (paramount chief) Wahunsunacawh. Wahunsunacawh/Powhatan responded to the encroachment of the Spanish from the south by allying more than twenty tributary groups under one confederacy, and through Captain John Smith established Jamestown as yet another tributary settlement within the greater Powhatan sphere. Again, the peace proved short-lived. The Anglo-Powhatan Wars and the aftermath of Bacon’s Rebellion prompted the establishment of the first Indian reservations, restricting the territorial limits for the original inhabitants of Tsenacommacah.\n\n* Traders operating out of English Virginia and Carolina united the greater southeast in the sale of human captives and deerskins. The changes wrought in the English shatterzone, the displacement, warfare, disease, exportation of slaves, and famine, set the stage for the first smallpox pandemic from 1696-1700. The Yamasee War that followed threatened the survival of the colony of South Carolina, but the damage was done. Slaving raids collapsed the Spanish mission system, nearly depopulating the Florida peninsula. Survivors banded together, forming alliances of convenience, and coalesced into confederacies like the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Chickasaw. Slaving raids, warfare, and disease left the southern tidewater open to English expansion.\n\n* From roughly 1638-1701 the Iroquois engaged in a massive, bloody expansion to monopolize the fur trade, and quicken their dead in a mourning war writ large. [The Beaver Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Wars#mediaviewer/File:5NationsExpansion.jpg) engulfed the Great Lakes region. Huron, Petun, Ottawa, Sauk, Fox, Miami, Illinois, and Kickapoo refugees fled west, to the territory of the Winnebago and Menominee. Like slavers in the southeast, where the Iroquois raided, displacement, famine and disease followed. After the Great Peace of Montreal, displaced refugees repopulated the Midwest, but their presence was short-lived. A new land-hungry confederacy of 13 colonies declared their independence, and eagerly sought to expand westward.\n\n* In 1791 the United States suffered it’s largest military disaster on the banks of the Maumee River. General Arthur St. Clair led 1,400 soldiers to attack Miami villages in Ohio at the behest of a government whose Indian policy “was essentially a land policy” (Calloway). With 1,000 U.S. soldiers killed or wounded, practically the entire U.S. army at the time, the defeat jeopardized the security of the new nation and emphasized the potential power of a united Indian confederacy. Unfortunately, the Northwestern Confederacy was not to last. Shawnee, Miami, Delaware, Wyandot, Ottawa, Ojibwa, Sauk, Fox and Mahican warriors dispersed the following winter as the U.S. conducted damage control, and exploited divisions to undermine the confederacy. The Treaty of Greenville in 1795 ceded 2/3 of Ohio, Indiana and the future site of Chicago to the United States, opening the floodgates for American expansion over the Appalachian Mountains. Forty years after the Northwestern Confederacy destroyed the U.S. army, 938,000 people lived in Ohio, making it the fourth most populous state in the Union.\n\n* On June 30, 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the [Indian Removal Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act#mediaviewer/File:Trails_of_Tears_en.png) into law. Though other nations were effected, the bulk of the forced migrants were from the Five Civilized Tribes, the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee, settled throughout the southeast. Over 50,000 people emigrated or were forcibly removed to Oklahoma, while ~5,000 died in the transition. 25 million acres were thereby free for American settlement.\n\nA century after initial contact more than two million people lived east of the Mississippi River. Less than five hundred were European. After more than three hundred years of war, epidemics, displacement, and maneuverings the descendants European colonists finally gained hegemony east of the Mississippi by 1820 (Richter). The displacement of Native Americans from eastern North America was neither fast nor easy nor inevitable. Myths of vacant land ignore the processes that contributed to population dispersal, and the complicated history of Native American-European interaction.\n\nOne more myth of conquest to come.

        "text": "Main thread:\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2uxe2o/if_modern_man_came_into_existence_200k_years_ago/\n\nIt is an interesting question--granted, one that there are numerous threads in /r/AskHistorians about, but there are several anthropologists in /r/AskScience and the top comment by /u/atomfullerene handles the issues well and there are several other great responses. Unfortunately, it is still a default subreddit, and we all know what that means: [The first offending thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2uxe2o/if_modern_man_came_into_existence_200k_years_ago/cocnjey) (EDIT: Thank you /r/AskScience mods!).\n\n&gt;Part of the problem is that the 10,000 year figure is based on whatever evidence we can dig up. Who knows? Groups may have tried all sorts of different things, but if no one finds an archaeological site, we will never know. Just for example, a major site was just found in the US because they are building a bridge. No one thought there were any urban settlements of that age (12,000 years or so) in that part of the world.\n\nThere is a \"slight\" factual issue here: I don't know what site is being referred to but it is probably something like Meadowcroft, which shows pre-Clovis habitation, and the person simply confused \"major site\" with \"urban site\". This is making the generous assumption that, one, they are not getting confused about Gobekli Tepe (which is also definitely not an urban site, but it is often confused as such), and two, it isn't just bullshit.\n\nThe bigger problem has to do with methodology, namely the idea that we only know what we dig up. I think this is a bit easier to frame using paleontology, because the Reddit mind reflexively trusts what it arbitrarily deems science: would it be accurate to say that all we know about the Cambrian is what we have found, and that there could have been land dwelling mammalian megafauna? Well, no. We may only have what we dig up, but what we have gives us a picture of the period, and we can make solid inferences based on that. For the Cambrian we can look at the sort of body forms around at the time and later developments and conclude that no, there was no yeti. For the Paleolithic, we can look at artefact assemblages and conclude that no, there was no urbanization or what they would term \"advanced civilization\". So despite what this post says:\n\n&gt;Kilometer high glaciers have a way of destroying evidence.\n\nWe have rock shelters, camp sites and boatloads of shaped artifacts. Essentially what this line of reasoning is asking us to believe is that the glaciers crashed through, destroying all the cities but leaving the fire pits. Quite silly. Of course, this non-non-evidence is essentially what drives the rest of the conversation. But, hey, they have authoritative support!\n\n&gt;Google Randall Carlson, Graham Hancock, John Anthony West.\n\nGraham Hancock, for those who have not had the pleasure, is one of the founders of the \"lost civilizations\" \"theories\". [Bad Archaeology](http://www.badarchaeology.com/?page_id=547) has a good description of the theories along with refutations, although they seem to have replaced their earlier well designed website with an abomination, so that's sad. Basically, Hancock argues that there have been many lost civilizations stretching back hundreds of thousands of years, including a global civilization based out of, where else, Antarctica. The evidence for this is the usual suspects, such as multiple pyramid building cultures, \"unexplained\" sites like Tiwanaku and Gobekli Tepe, and the standard Illuminati lay line triangle stuff.\n\nIn short, exactly the sort of thing we expect to find sited on /r/AskScience!\n\n&gt;Joe Rogan has had them all on his podcast, if you guys are interested you should give it a listen.\n\nTotal sidenote: I have no idea who Joe Rogan is, but it seems like whenever there is a topic of Reddit's chosen Reddity bullshit, from MRA brütal takedowns of feminazis to ancient civilizations to drugs, Joe Rogan will have made a podcast about it. I'm beginning to suspect he is an escaped piece of the greater Reddit consciousness that has somehow taken corporeal form, a bit like the gods in Discworld.\n\n&gt;He's theorizing, he appears to fully own that it's a theory and with the others that he's waxing philosophical. \n\n\"Waxing philosophical\" apparently means \"spouting unsubstantiated bullshit\". Anyway, thread reported and moving on. There is plenty of other Ancient Aliens style claptrap about to look at, but there are a few other major misconceptions about Paleolithic life to be corrected. First up:\n\n&gt;If Neolithic Ned was screwing around trying to get a rhinoceros to settle down or whatever, then he was going to miss the berry harvest or the salmon run or something, and his family was going to go hungry. Neolithic people had cultures that were very well adapted to their environments, and didn't have much of a margin for trying new and different things.\n\nWell, the most obvious problem with this is confusion of terminology: The Neolithic is defined as essentially the \"early agriculturalists\", although the term can be confused when looking at the loci of domestication. Most famously, Gobekli Tepe is considered a Neolithic site despite not being made by agriculturalists because it exhibits certain cultural features associated with neolithic peoples. That nuance aside, this person is simply confusing the Neolithic with the Paleolithic, which actually shows a pretty shocking lack of willingness for even basic research before making a top level comment on /r/AskScience.\n\nThe bigger problem, however, is the conceptualization of Paleolithic lifestyles. This person, and many many others in the thread, is essentially parroting the standard line about hunter gatherer lifestyles, that they live hand to mouth, constantly unsure of their next meal and one mistake away from starvation and ruin. This is, in fact, the complete opposite of reality observed from modern hunter gatherer populations. Hunter gatherer populations have excellent food security and starvation is practically unknown (in fact, it has been reported that they tend to find the very concept absurd). To understand why this is, it is useful to wash away all cultural preconceptions and view hunter gatherers and agriculturalists as two differing types of subsistence strategy:\n\n1. Agriculture: An intensive exploitation of a narrow range of food sources in a limited geographic range.\n\n2. Immediate return foraging: The non-intensive exploitation of a wide range of food sources in a wide geographic range.\n\nThe diversity of the hunter gatherer diet comes from the diversity of their food sources and their critical ability to move--the lack of burdensome material possession and locations that effectively tie them to the land (like a farm) means that a lack of resources in a particular place can be remedied by simply moving to another. Likewise, the failure of a particular food sources can be remedied by a temporary more intensive exploitation of another. For example, when a San hunter is unable to catch game, the band can simply switch to a diet more reliant on mongongo nuts. The best example actually comes from archaeological sites, where we can see populations that live near the shoreline fall back on shellfish and other easily harvested marine resources. Shellfish may not be as fun to eat as a red deer, but they are a reliably gathered source of protein. \n\nNow compare this to agriculturalists: if a localized disaster strikes, say in the form of floods, there is no real recourse to movement. The reason why, for example, Yellow River floods are so devastating is because the subsistence strategies of agriculturalists is so heavily tied to the a particular area that if that area radically alters the agriculturalist is not able to simply move to a new one.  Likewise, if a food source fails, say because of a bad winter or summer, there is not the same recourse to other resources.\n\nNow of course agriculturalists are acutely aware of this problem and develop strategies to deal with it. Storage is the most obvious, but of course storage is very uncertain and a few minor mistakes (say, an improperly sealed top) can negate that. The other is diversification of crops (for example, the plating of millet along with wheat) and falling back on marginal resources, such as thistle or even tree bark. The problem with these is that agriculture by its nature radically alters the environment and pushes out these marginal resources--for example, by clearing weeds, picking weeds and eliminating pests. This means that even these fallbacks are frequently not enough, which is why a glance through history reveals it is full of famine and starvation (Horden and Purcell estimate that famine occurs in a typical Mediterranean environment once every seven years). The over-reliance on a small range of food resources is essentially putting all the eggs in one basket: a highly productive basket, yes, but also a highly unstable one.\n\nAn obvious objection to my characterization of hunter gatherers is that it relies on modern ethnography, and how can we say that is appropriate for dealing with the Paleolithic? This is a good point, but the answer is that modern hunter gatherers are in the worst situation they have been in in human history. One reason is that they live in the most marginal of territory, be it the desert of the Kalahari, the Arctic tundra, or the deep jungle of Malaysia. These are environments too poor to support agriculture, highly marginal by their very nature. In contrast, Paleolithic hunter gatherers would have also lived in southern France, the Levant, and the Pacific Northwest--far more comfortable locations. The other reason is that modern hunter gatherer populations are actively persecuted by nearby agriculturalists. Paleolithic populations did not need to worry about logging companies, poachers with guns and a willingness to murder, or governments that want territory \"pristine\" for ecotourism. In short, they suffer all the detriments of civilization with none of the benefits--but even they live lives that seem much better than nearby impoverished agriculturalists.\n\nReturning to the post, the rest of the thread has plenty of discussion of \"progress\" and the like, but rather than type more here I'll just link to [a critique of progress](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2t9a40/is_it_possible_there_were_civilizations_10_or_20/cnxk1bi) I made a few weeks ago.\n\nSources for this are extensive: the best widely available description of the Paleolithic I have found are *Prehistoric Europe* ed Barry Cunliffe and *Cro-Magnon* by Brian Fagen--unfortunately both focus on Europe. For my discussion of hunter gatherers the literature is extensive, but Marshall Sahlins' \"The Original Affluent Society\" is still a must read.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis is my first post here. I just experienced some badhistory today, and it left a bitter taste in my mouth. I'm a college freshman, and in my Spanish class today we were discussing holidays that are celebrated in the US, but not in Spanish speaking countries. On the topic of Thanksgiving, my professor asked the class what century the first Thanksgiving took place. A student raised his hand and when she called on him he said that it took place in the 17th century. Now, so far prior to this I have liked this professor and her general enthusiasm for history, but what happened next annoyed me somewhat. She corrected the student saying that it was the 18th century, reminding him that the 18th century refers to the 1700s, as if the student had made a simple mistake with correlating the numbers (I heard him mumble afterward \"I thought it was the 1600s...\"). The professor went on to explain that the real first Thanksgiving in the land that is now the United States took place in the 1500s between the Spaniards and Native Americans in Texas. I assume she was referring to an event which took place in [San Elizario, Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Elizario,_Texas#The_First_Thanksgiving) (she said if we googled \"The First Thanksgiving\" that would be the first result because \"google is good about this now\", but I tried this and it didn't work, and information on it seems a bit scarce). Now, she usually likes to point out things that Spanish speakers did earlier or better than English speakers, as a way to one up the anglophone nations or something. I'm generally alright with this, because it is a Spanish class after all and she needs a way to get people interested in Spanish speaking countries. However, she decided to hammer in the point that the Spanish/Native Thanksgiving in Texas took place 200 years earlier than the English/Native Thanksgiving in Massachusetts. \n\nNow, I think we all know that the event commonly referred to as Thanksgiving in the US is generally [\"traced to a poorly documented 1621 celebration at Plymouth in present-day Massachusetts\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving#In_the_United_States), as stated by Wikipedia. The event is indeed poorly documented, and there has been a lot of debate over the years concerning when, how, and even if the First Thanksgiving took place. However, I think any history savvy person knows that it didn't occur in the 1700s. \n\nFurthermore, the event in San Elizario that my professor argued was the first Thanksgiving took place in 1598. This means that the Spanish/Native Thanksgiving did not take place \"200 years earlier\" than the English/Native one, as my professor proudly claimed, but rather a mere 23 years earlier, if we use the generally accepted date of the Massachusetts event.\n\nI considered correcting my professor in class, but I am generally shy and felt it might be rude, so I decided not to. I don't want to be \"that guy\" after all, who interrupts class to argue with the teacher (we had a kid like that in one of my classes last semester and he was pretty much universally hated). So I'm a bit torn on how to handle this. I have considered sending my professor a polite email with the correction, but I am wondering if it would be better to just do nothing and let it slide. I mean I suppose it is a pretty minor point after all in the grand scheme of things, and I don't want to get on her bad side for calling her out. But after this I'm going to have to be careful about what she says, because after someone gives you the entirely wrong century for one of the most famous events in American history, it's hard to trust anything they say, especially in a class that covers a lot of Spanish/American history.",

Specific times were a bit more scattered but to try and accommodate everyone I eventually settled for 19:00 UTC since the biggest spike seemed to be around there (±1h).  \nThere was another plateau around 9-12:00 UTC but far smaller and not as distinct. However, if anyone wants to host a secondary game for our time-zone-challenged members I'd be more than happy to edit that in the OP.\n\nSo in short:   \n- **The game will be starting next Saturday (14^th ), 19:00 UTC** (in her grace and boredom our most ~~feared~~ beloved /u/cordis_melum has provided us [an EST conversion chart](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2tw95h/meta_come_join_us_for_a_multiplayer_game_of/co32h30)).  \nPlan for 2\\3 hours but as many have also opted to keep the end time open let's see how it develops.  \nEDIT: Note that this is going to be repeated every Saturday for the next four weeks, possibly more if the game is not finished and still interesting.\n\n- If you are going to be running late or your game is unstable we'll try and accomodate you if possible but in the and we'll go with the words of the prophet: \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few... or the one\" (Book of Khan the Wrathful).  \nEDIT: Joining individual sessions only is also an option if need be, just remember that the AI can be pretty wild at times.\n\n- You may chose to play any nation in the world as long as the **nation's total tax base is not greater than 23** ([where to find it on the starting screen](http://i.imgur.com/ydSi5Oe.jpg) and also [complete 1444 list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-exn0lHJXro5t2Ndfu2ROVa6S7eSWfAOaRXvIDTP5o/pubhtml)). I realise this probably isn't the best way to do it but that leaves you with an abundance of great countries and for a first try it should suffice.  \nYou may also change your country at a later date before game start if you'd rather go to a more or less player-heavy area.  \nEDIT: But if you want to be Japan you'll have to work for it as a Daimyo you lousy imperialist!\n\n- I will try and provide a regularly updated list of chosen countries in the OP but please also check the thread yourself and notify me if you want to switch nation.  \nEDIT: I realise now this is not really a thing i  can do while on mobile. Please use the age-old CTRL+F method until I can get around to it in a more reasonable way.\n\n- If you want to stream the game I'll happily mention and link you in the reminder and server info thread on the day of the event in case people without the game want to make fun of us too.\n\n- **Only the base game is necessary to play**, all DLCs should be shared by the host so don't worry about that.\n\n- In-game communication is still something of an issue, especially before I can estimate a turnout. Skype? Steam chat? Anyone with a flock of messenger pigeons currently unemployed? Suggestions are still open on that one.  \nEDIT: I am told there is a /r/paradoxplaza teamspeak server so we'll probably go with that.\n\nThat is all I can think of so far. Get selecting and don't let the Frenchmen bite.\n\nEDIT: note that we already have [a steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/badhistory) for general purposes.",

Jaded and cynical, it didn't surprise me when my young sister (in 6th grade) told me that Lenin committed genocide, or that Columbus discovered America, or that people in the \"dark ages\" thought the world was flat. These supposed truisms and more elicited merely a disappointed chuckle and a short explanation of reality.\n\nI've been on this sub since day one, I thought I'd seen it all. But nothing could've prepared me for the bizarre idiocy I encountered today when my sister showed me [this test](http://imgur.com/a/7XbRh).\nI'll just start from the beginning and deal with the worst offenses.\n&gt;2. How many years ago did people came from Asia to Japan\n&gt;A. 2,000\n&gt;B. 300\n&gt;C. 500\n&gt;D. 1,000\n\nThe correct answer here is supposed to be A., but [the paleolithic history of Japan goes back at least 35,000 years](http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/palaeol.html). Quite famously, Japan's Jomon culture is responsible for the oldest pottery, dating to [more than 12,000 years ago](http://books.google.com/books/about/Ancient_Jomon_of_Japan.html?id=vGnAbTyTynsC).\nEven if one of these answers was a simple typo lacking an extra 0, it would be incorrect by at least 10 millennia.\n\n&gt;8. ____ were the first group in Mesopotamia\n&gt;A. Assyrians\n&gt;B. Babylonians\n&gt;C. Ute\n&gt;D. Sumerians\n\nThe oldest Mesopotamian culture listed is of course the Sumerians, but they weren't anywhere near to being the first group of people in Mesopotamia. They were the first urban civilization, but they were descendants of many much earlier inhabitants of the region: the [Jemdet-Nasr culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemdet_Nasr_period), the proto-literate peoples of the [Uruk Period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk_period) in the 4th millennium BCE, the [Ubaid cultures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period) from the 4th to 7th millennia, and the [Hassuna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassuna_culture).\n\n&gt;11. The leader of the Mongols is ___\n&gt;A. Kublai Khan\n&gt;B. Ban Po\n&gt;C. Genghis Khan\n&gt;D. Qin Shi Huangdi\n\nGrammar is a bitch. The current leader of the Mongols IS [Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsakhiagiin_Elbegdorj), President for the last 6 years.\nHowever this question was probably supposed to deal with the past, so we run into the bigger problem: Kublai Khan and Genghis Khan were both leaders of the Mongols. In fact, they both held the exact same rank, *Great Khan*, it's right there in the name. The Toluid split occurred after Kublai's election at the kurultai of 1260 so Genghis might be a more correct answer, but Kublai was nevertheless the Khagan of the Mongols.\n\n&gt;12. This man made a code of laws, that our laws today are based on, what is his name\n&gt;A. Assyrians\n&gt;B. Luther\n&gt;C. Hammurabi\n&gt;D. Nebuchadnezzar II\n\nHammurabi's Code is *in no way* the basis of any modern legal system. When the American legal system was founded in the 18th century, no one on earth had known a single thing about Hammurabi for more than two thousand years. British Common Law, which was the most direct predecessor to US laws, had no connection to Hammurabi. Even the Roman legal system, which is perhaps the most distant link in a chain of legal continuity to modern law, was formulated in a time when Hammurabi's stelae were already all lost, his cities buried, and his language and people forgotten.\n\n&gt;14. ____ dynasty invented paper, the magnetic compass, acupuncture\n&gt;A. Tang\n&gt;B. Ch'in\n&gt;C. Han\n&gt;D. Tao\n\nNo single dynasty of China invented those three things. Acupuncture is ascribed to the legendary Second Sovereign, Shen Nung, of around 2700 BCE, while [*Bian Shi*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture#History) date back to at *least* the Neolithic. Paper was invented during the [Han Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_paper#Early_papermaking_in_China), so that's probably the answer the test was aiming for. Magnetism was used in the Han for divination rituals, but it was discovered by Chinese alchemists at the end of the Warring States period of the Zhou dynasty and wasn't employed as a navigational compass until nearly a [thousand years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass#China) afterwards.\n\n&gt;15. The major religion in India is ____\n&gt;A. Buddhism\n&gt;B. Hinduism\n&gt;C. Catholic\n&gt;D. Shinto\n\nNevermind the inconsistent tenses; somehow my sister answered \"Buddhism\" and got this correct. [84% of Indians were Hindu as of the 2010 census.](http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_And_You/religion.aspx)\nI gather there was some controversy in the 2011 census that may have dropped that below 80%, but still, Hinduism is the overwhelming majority.\n\n&gt;18.\n\nThe question and answers here are just outright nonsensical. Not even going to bother. Bitch be high, yo.\n\n&gt;20. What ideas did India make to math\n\nNot so much bad history as horrible grammar, but I'll just point out that it's not like India invented pi, and it was independently discovered or approximated by multiple other civilizations.\n\n&gt;21. Which dynasty made the Great Wall of China\n\nThis one is almost impossible to answer. My sister went with the Qin, which is arguably correct as Qin Shi Huang made the northern fortifications a major project, but there had been walls there for 500 years before him, and the majority of the structure that we call the GREAT Wall wasn't built until the Ming dynasty, which isn't an option. Expansions and renovations were initiated by many dynasties throughout the last two millennia.\n\n&gt;22. Today Japan's major religion is _____\n&gt;A. Buddhism\n&gt;B. Hinduism\n&gt;C. Shinto\n&gt;D. Catholic\n\nThere are those inconsistent tenses again... Anyways, this question requires a subtlety of distinction which this teacher clearly is incapable of. It begins with the fact that Shintoism is not a religion in the same sense as the other options. There *are* organized institutions of shintoist cults, but these do not outnumber Buddhists in Japan. The vast majority of Japanese *do* identify as Shinto to some degree or another, but that's because Shinto encompasses pervasive cultural traditions and is not necessarily a matter of religiosity. Identifying as Shinto does not prevent the majority of Japanese as claiming to be \"not religious\", and many who 'practice' Shinto identify as Buddhist simultaneously.\n\nAgain, this was a test in a 6th grade \"Social Studies\" class. I feel really bad for those students, but don't know what else to do save share my misery with you.\nEdit: Reddit turned all my question numbers into 1's and I'm too stupid to tell why! Doesn't matter I guess.",

        "text": "When we last met Karl F. Boetel, editor-in-chief of the ... um ... blog *Radish Magazine*, he was hard at work at [restoring the rightful reputation of the Congo Free State as a tropical paradise where nothing bad ever happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2pob9r/neoreactionary_apologism_for_the_congo_free_state/). In our newest encounter, he's aiming his usual weapons of uncritical use of primary sources and mark-missing sarcasm at an even bigger historical myth: that [the black slaves of the American South would have preferred not to be slaves](http://www.donotlink.com/diam). Yes, they were apparently peachy keen with being owned by and forced to work for someone else.\n\nDisclaimer: *I am no historian.* I am an undergraduate mathematics student at a reasonably well-known American university; my formal training in history ended with secondary school. I also have an unhealthy obsession with the far right, which has taught me such fascinating things as that [70% of the slaveowners in the United States were Jews, and all the rest of them were also black](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2q5h16/the_whites_owning_black_slaves_in_america_hoax/). My knowledge of most fields of history is scanty, which is why my submissions here are all the historiographical equivalent of what mathematicians call [nuking mosquitoes](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/798215/nuking-the-mosquito-ridiculously-complicated-ways-to-achieve-very-simple-resul).\n\nBoetel includes a lengthy discussion on slavery in Africa and a critique of Adam Hochschild's *King Leopold's Ghost*; my knowledge of African history is too weak to evaluate his argument fairly, so I'll leave that to someone else. He briefly touches on typical scientific-racist claims about IQ differences between the races; I *can* refute those, but this is not the right forum. (The curious should consult [this literature review](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-67-2-130.pdf) by seven leading psychologists, especially PDF pages 17-18.) Both of these tangents, in any case, are separable from what I take as his three main claims: first, that slaves were content and treated well and that certain abuses, especially the selling of young children away from their families, were quite rare; second, that slaves did not desire freedom, which in fact drastically lowered their standard of living; and third, that freedom is overrated. Boetel's treatment of the evidence is superficial and selective, and none of his three contentions withstands scrutiny. I address them in turn.\n\n**Were slaves treated well?**\n\nBoetel devotes the most space to establishing this point; I will therefore devote the most effort to refuting it. Boetel's principal source, from which he quotes at tedious length, is *A South-Side View of Slavery* by Rev. Nehemiah Adams, a Unitarian minister from Boston. Adams recounts his encounters with slaves during a trip to Savannah, Georgia, and portrays them as generally proud and contented, remarking especially on their good cheer and fancy Sunday clothes. Boetel places considerable emphasis on Adams' claim that he sharply opposed slavery before his trip and so had little incentive to whitewash what he saw. Choosing a representative from Boetel's thousands of words of quotation is difficult, but take this as a sample:\n&gt;A better-looking, happier, more courteous set of people I had never seen, than those colored men, women, and children whom I met the first few days of my stay in Savannah. It had a singular effect on my spirits. They all seemed glad to see me. I was tempted with some vain feelings, as though they meant to pay me some special respect. It was all the more grateful, because for months sickness and death had covered almost every thing, even the faces of friends at home, with sadness to my eye, and my spirits had drooped. But to be met and accosted with such extremely civil, benevolent looks, to see so many faces break into pleasant smiles in going by, made one feel that he was not alone in the world even in a land of strangers.\n\nAdams also recounts one instance of a young infant girl put up for auction, only for the sheriff to invoke a law against selling young children and return the girl to her family. The implication, Boetel claims, is that such sales in fact never happened.\n\nBoetel's argument is specious and relies on several questionable elided assumptions. He (and, apparently, Adams) believe that people who seem content to outsiders must be well-treated; given the documented existence of [Stockholm syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome), this seems incompletely justified. But more fundamentally, we cannot assume Adams' reports are representative of slavery throughout the South! Adams was one man who spent one winter in one city - and I do mean *city* specifically. All of Boetel's quotations show Adams recounting his encounters on the streets in Savannah; there is no sign that he ever set foot on a plantation field. Though the distinction between traitorous Uncle Tom \"house slaves\" and ground-down \"field slaves\" as portrayed by, say, [Malcolm X](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/mxp/speeches/mxa17.html) is [exaggerated](http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2013/04/house_slaves_vs_field_slaves_were_there_betrayers_like_djangos_stephen.html), Adams still probably saw only the best-treated slaves doing the least physically demanding work.\n\nIf we want to fight Boetel on his own favored turf of quoting primary sources uncritically, we should have some primary sources of our own handy. Fortunately, someone who has not me has done that: the pseudonymous blogger \"The Prussian\" in his [Anti-Racialist Q&amp;A](http://www.skepticink.com/prussian/2014/03/31/the-anti-racialist-q-a/). Skip down to section 2.6. The Prussian quotes no less an authority than Charles Darwin, traveling in South America, whose remarks fit my skepticism about whether Adams' experiences are representative:\n&gt; I will not even allude to the many heart-sickening atrocities which I authenitically heard of – nor would I have mentioned the above revolting details, had I not met with several people, so blinded by the contitutional gaiety of the negro, as to speak of slavery as a tolerable evil.  Such people have generally visited at the houses of the upper classes, where the domestic slaves are usually well treated; and they have not, like myself, lived amongst the lower classes.\n\nand Charles Dickens' *American Notes*, in which Dickens contrasts the slaveholders' claims of contented and well-treated slaves with their descriptions of runaways:\n\n&gt;Let us try this public opinion by another test, which is important in three points of view: first, as showing how desperately timid of public opinion slave-owners are, in their delicate descriptions of fugitive slaves in widely circulated newspapers; secondly, as showing how perfectly contented the slaves are, and how very seldom they run away; thirdly, as exhibiting their entire freedom from scar, or blemish, or any mark of cruel infliction, as their pictures are drawn, not by lying abolitionists, but by their own truthful masters.\n\n&gt;The following are a few specimens of the advertisements in the public papers.  It is only four years since the oldest among them appeared; and others of the same nature continue to be published every day, in shoals.\n\n&gt;'Ran away, Negress Caroline.  Had on a collar with one prong turned down.'\n\n&gt;'Ran away, a black woman, Betsy. Had an iron bar on he right leg.'\n\n&gt;'Ran away, the negress Fanny.  Had in an iron band about her neck.'\n\n&gt;[...]\n\n&gt;'Detained at the police jail, the negro wench, Myra.  Has several marks of LASHING, and has irons on her feet.'\n\n&gt;'Ran away a negro woman and two children.  A few days before she went off, I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face.  I tried to make the letter M.'\n\nThe Prussian also raises a good point about the annulled sale of a baby:\n\n&gt;Those of you with IQs greater than room temperature will have observed that if it got to the point that a baby could even be put up for sale, it must have been a practice that had some acceptance and such sales must have happened at least to some extent.\n\nI don't have much to add except for one delicious bit of irony. Boetel intersperses his multiple-paragraph copy-pastes of Adams with quotations from reviews of *Django Unchained*. One such passage, with his trademark misplaced snark following:\n\n&gt;&gt;At other times, we see chained slaves headed to the slave market in Mississippi or slaves forced to fight each other like animals for the white man’s amusement, or, in a particularly gruesome scene, a runaway slave is thrown to wild dogs. We see how his body is torn apart. We hear his screams.\n\n&gt;Well, thank goodness for *that* bit of realism. I was worried we’d never cover the period in American history when runaway slaves were thrown to *wild dogs*.\n\nGiven Boetel's fondness for primary sources, especially a certain anthology of WPA slave narratives hosted on a University of Virginia website, he may be interested in hearing from [Charity Anderson of Mobile, Alabama](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/wpa/anderso1.html):\n\n&gt;My old Marster was a good man, he treated all his slaves kind, and took care of dem, he wanted to leave dem hisn chillun. It sho' was hard for us older uns to keep de little cullered chillun out ob de dinin' room whar ol marster ate, cause when dey would slip in and stan' by his cheer, when he finished eatin' he would fix a plate and gib dem and dey would set on de hearth and eat. But honey chile, all white folks warn 't good to dere slaves, cause *I'se seen pore niggers almos' tore up by dogs*, and whipped unmercifully, when dey did'nt do lack de white folks say.\n\n**Did slaves want to be free?**\n\nOne tenet of neoreactionary thought is the [superiority of exit to voice](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/11/patchwork-positive-vision-part-1.html). Political dialogue and democracy, so the theory goes, are corrupted by holier-than-thou posturing and perverse incentives. It's better to let leaders run their countries however they would like and let people vote with their feet.\n\nThis principle would seem to show that slaves did prefer freedom to slavery. Between 1810 and 1860, 100,000 slaves [risked fearsome punishments to escape to the North](http://www.historynet.com/underground-railroad); thousands more [ran off to the Union Army during the War of Southern Treason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband_%28American_Civil_War%29) or participated in [violent revolts](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/did-african-american-slaves-rebel/). One man unusually well placed to compare the benefits of freedom and slavery for himself was [Solomon Northup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Northup), author of *Twelve Years a Slave*. After his capture by slave traders posing as circus workers, he did *not* in fact become comfortably accustomed to his newfound life as a slave free from worry: he made strenuous efforts to get help freeing himself, and later became an active abolitionist.\n\nBoetel's evidence to the contrary: an essay by Oscar Wilde (!!) and a few sentences from one of the other WPA slave narratives, to the effect that slavery was better than freedom because slaves had their basic material needs met. Clearly, one black woman's recollections seventy years in her past, in the middle of a horrible economic crisis and following the national government's [betrayal of the freedmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir_of_American_race_relations), are completely objective and can speak for all black people everywhere.\n\nBoetel also cites as support for slavery that a vast number of freed slaves died of starvation during and in the years immediately after the Civil War. This is a very silly argument. Uneducated penniless people in a region destroyed by warfare tend not to do very well. [Hundreds of thousands, or possibly millions, of Germans died in the years after World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_%281944%E2%80%9350%29); this does not in fact constitute an argument for Nazism.\n\n**OK, but suppose that the slaves were in fact treated well. When you're guaranteed a place to sleep, medical care, and three meals a day, isn't caring about such empty notions as \"freedom\" and \"autonomy\" and \"the choice of one's own destiny\" and \"the right to the profits of one's own labor\" a bit beside the point?**\n\nNo. No, it is absolutely not beside the point, you racist dumbfuck.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nReal research rebuts Radish rag's racist reactionary revisionist ramblings, radical right regrettably 'rong.\n\nThanks for reading. A few people floated the idea of making RadishMag (or neoreactionary stuff more generally) a recurring /r/badhistory series, and as the only thing that can keep me sane after reading this stuff is finding other people with whom to laugh at it, I would love to see this happen. Anyone interested?\n\nAlso, don't miss [this short but sweet flame war](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/#comment-41708) that Boetel starts in another blog's comments section when he tries to make this same argument. The other participants were not as patient as I was here.\n\n[**EDIT:** blockquote and link formatting.]",

        "text": "Firstly, I hope this doesn't violate the moratorium, because it isn't Nazi Apologia rather it is warcrimes olympics.  \n\nIn a discussion of the Geneva Convention, somehow, this gets brought up by Hencher27:  \"No they bombed the shit out of a surrendered Germany, particularly in Dresden and killed hundreds of thousands of people.\"\n\n(http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2unfmu/isis_burns_jordanian_pilot_alive/co9yu2u)\n\nThis in reference to the fact that the Allies did not wander into Germany and kill all Germans on sight.  In Hencher27's mind, the allies were more than happy to kill all Germans from the air.\n\nBut lets break this down a bit:  \"No they bombed the shit out of a surrendered Germany\"\n\nThis isn't true.  Germany officially surrendered on May 8th 1945, while the last bombing mission against Germany took place on April 25th 1945.  As a side note, it actually took place against Czechoslovakia.  Even though it was part of Nazi Germany it wasn't really Germany per se. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_air_operations_during_the_Battle_of_Europe)\n\nIn all there were only 6 strategic bombing operations against Germany in 1945.  So we weren't bombing the shit out of a surrendered Germany.\n\nEven in 1944, Germany Industrial output was increasing, despite massive bombing campaigns, so there is no argument that the allies were bombing the shit out of an almost dead Germany that year either.  \n\nNow onto Dresden...There are some controversial aspects of it, and it is sad that it destroyed many cultural artifacts.  However, it was also a legitimate military target, it was not bombed for fun.  There were over 100 factories still producing armaments and supplies for the Wehrmacht, and it had remained untouched by bombs throughout the war.  Destroying it probably didn't end the war any faster and Germany was close to defeat in February 1945, but we have the benefit of HINDSIGHT.  In early 1945 the Allies were just coming off from the Battle of the Bulge.  There is no way Allied High Command could know that the war would end in three months.  Though certainly they realized the end was near, they had to take every action to prevent additional German counter offensives.  Including their ability to produce goods for the war effort.\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Military_and_industrial_profile)\n\nI will end on this note too, and it is a bit of a rant.  I don't know why people are so quick to jump and defend German civilians killed during the war.  Yes, it is sad that WWII happened and it was surely horrific.  All told, about 350,000 German civilians died in Allied bombing campaigns, or .5% of the total casualties of the war.  For contrast, Soviet civilians represent 24% of casualties from the war, but I never hear a soul complain about how forgotten they are.\n\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#Casualties)\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties)\n\n\n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2unov9/indigenous_americans_were_descended_from_those/",
        "text": "[Here](http://i.imgur.com/yMJomaQ.png) is the offending Reddit post. To avoid vote brigading, I blacked out the username and used a screenshot (screenshots are also good because sometimes a mod will delete the bad history). I'll just say that this post is from a default subreddit that I-and probably everyone in this sub-occasionally visit.\n\n&gt; Peoples in that part of the world [that is, the Americas] moved around a lot.\n\nIt's undeniable that many indigenous American peoples lived a nomadic lifestyle. However, there were nomadic peoples in all the other continents, including the Mongols, the Xiongnu, and other steppe peoples and empires, the Romani and other traveller groups in Europe, many (if not most or all-I know nothing about Australian Aboriginal history) peoples in Australia, a bunch of peoples throughout Africa. The Americas weren't as nomadic as people often think. Even many Great Plains peoples, generally thought of as nomadic *mounted* tribes by laymen, were a lot more settled in the 15th century compared to the 19th century. This was also true for the Amazon.\n\n&gt; They would build cities and abandon them \n\nThis is true, but so did the [Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-Ramesses), the [Etruscans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina), the [Shang Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinxu), [modern Azerbaijanis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agdam), [modern Montserratians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth,_Montserrat), and [Ancient Greeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kameiros). People, both in the past and in the present, had perfectly good reasons to leave a city (sometimes a natural disaster, sometimes economic shifts, sometimes war, sometimes other things, often a combination of these factors), and the Precolumbian Americans were no exception.\n\n&gt; for reasons we'll probably never understand.\n\nSince the Classic Maya \"Collapse\" is the most famous of these supposedly unexplained abandonments, let's just use that as an example. My thanks to /u/Mictlantecuhtli for answering my question back in /r/AskHistorians about [the Classic Maya \"Collapse\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2uiaxo/what_are_the_current_views_on_the_classic_maya/) (I actually needed that for another reason, but now I can use it here). I'll just copy his answer, since he obviously knows more than me on the subject:\n\n&gt; There wasn't a collapse as most people think. There wasn't death and destruction left and right. The end of the Classic period did see an increase in conflict, that's true. Places like Aguateca had walls put up around their ceremonial center, Colha was a huge lithic production center with a mass grave, and La Blanca shows that access to the ceremonial center was restricted and blocked. While there was conflict and killing, against who is still uncertain, there was also a lot of population movement. Many people from the Lowland areas moved to the Highlands or closer to the coast. The exact reasons for the Lowland Abandonment are still uncertain, but several reasons have been put forth. Some areas experienced intense drought that they could not deal with in part due to the deforestation that took place around most of their settlements for cooking fuel and to make plaster. There also seems to be a political change in which the king is no longer seen as divine and rules with the aid of a council. There was also a marked increase in trade along the coast which may have motivated people to move. Warfare certainly played a part for some areas. Most likely it was a combination of all of these factors to various degrees.\n\nSo we *do* have several likely reasons for the \"Collapse,\" and despite what the post says, I don't see why our understanding of the Maya during the Classic-Postclassic transition, or of any other Precolumbian events, will \"probably\" never improve.\n\n&gt; If you think about it, the Americas were the last stop for those with a wandering spirit-I mean, mankind started off in Africa and then spread throughout the world, with South America being the final area that could be reached by land.\n\nThe Americas were not \"the last stop for those with a wandering spirit.\"\n\nThey weren't even the last major uninhabited non-insular landmass. According to [the UNESCO Tentative World Heritage list submitted in 2004 by the National Monuments Council of Chile](http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1873/), Monte Verde, which is in *South* America, dates to around 12,800 BC. This is long before the human colonization of [most of Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_prehistory), for example. Furthermore, there are still lots of uninhabited or nearly uninhabited land throughout the world.\n\nAnd from a non-historical POV; why the fuck do \"those with a wandering spirit\" even need to wander into uninhabited areas? I'm pretty sure I can wander around just fine in the middle of Paris or Tokyo. \n\nSecond, maybe it's just me, but this person seems to be implying that the reason indigenous American cities sometimes became abandoned is *because they were descended from nomads.* Well, every living person is at least partly descended from nomads, so that doesn't mean anything. Also, I'm fairly certain that nomadism is not a genetic trait.\n\n&gt; (Islands are another matter)\n\nWhy? Why were, say, the Polynesians who first sailed to Easter Island any less brave than the first people to enter South America?\n\n&gt; Neither the Incas or the Aztecs had been around that long as major expansionist powers when the Europeans arrived, would their civilizations have grown larger or would they have vanished too? We'll never know.\n\nTrue, but I don't really like that verb \"vanish\" there.\n\n&gt; In any case, Cortez and the Conquistadors who first came into Tenochtitlan (home of the Aztecs)\n\nI'm not sure why this guy called Tenochtitlan the \"home\" of the Aztecs, instead of a better phrase like \"the Aztec capital\" or \"the greatest city of the Aztecs.\" That's like calling Paris \"the home of the French\" or London \"the home of the English.\"\n\n&gt; reported it as being a magnificent, impressive city that could compare with those in Spain-but they were hardly impartial and could have been either exaggerating or downplaying.\n\nTenochtitlan was compared to Spanish cities by Cortes, but another conquistador compared it to \"an enchanted vision from the tale of Amadis.\" \n\nAlso, in 1519, no Spanish cities had as high a population as Tenochtitlan. That really should have been mentioned, don't you think? This guy makes Tenochtitlan look like the American counterpart of something like Salamanca, when it was much grander.",

        "text": "I recently came across [this article](http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Perspectives_1/article_9178.shtml) in *The Final Call*, the Nation of Islam's newspaper. It's fascinating most of the time, but this article goes well beyond the pale. Mr. Tingba Muhammad, guest columnist, I suspect has no idea what he's talking about. \n\nThe article itself is meant to be about the history of black Americans with rape being at the centre. He's arguing, more or less, that black history is the history of inter-racial rape. While it's true that inter-racial rape does indeed have a long and sordid relationship with African American history, Mr. Muhammad's portrayal of it isn't entirely accurate. \n\nFor instance, in the fifth paragraph, we are told that: \n\n&gt; Columbus helped the Portuguese initiate the slave trade on the islands of the African coast...\n\nNow, to be clear here, Columbus was not a nice fellow. Segments from his journals say things about the Native Americans like:\n\n&gt; They ought to be good servants and of good skill, for I see that they repeat very quickly whatever is said to them\n\nwhich makes clear that he wasn't necessarily interested solely in hugs and snuggles. Equally, the quote that Mr. Muhammad uses in describing how Columbus and his crew interacted with the native Caribs is also accurate. One of Columbus' shipmates, Michele de Cuneo, did indeed write about raping a Carib woman and beating her until she acquiesced. It's not pleasant.\n\nBut blaming Columbus for Portuguese slavery is a bit of a stretch. If nothing else, at the time of his arrival in the Caribbean, he was sailing for Spain, not Portugal. Now, that said, he did have his connections in Portugal. If nothing else, he lived in Lisbon from 1477 to 1485, married a Portuguese lady, and first proposed his western route to Asia to King John II of Portugal. However, these connections to Portugal do not automatically mean he's responsible for the Portuguese slave trade. It's debatable what can be called the official beginning of the Portuguese slave trade in Africa; however, the first shipment of African slaves to Portugal arrived in Lagos in 1444. By 1460, the Portuguese were using enslaved Africans on the island of Madeira off the west coast of Africa. Christopher Columbus wasn't born until 1451. I tend to doubt that the 9 year old Columbus helped in the subjugation of Africans, but you never know. He might have been particularly malevolent. \n\nEqually, he didn't help found Spanish slavery. That too had been thriving without Columbus' help, especially with regards to the conquest of the Canary Islands. While it could be argued that he inaugurated the trans-Atlantic slave trade, that too seems a bit more coincidental than something that can be directly blamed on him. He wandered to the New World and in doing so fuelled the ability of the Spanish and Portuguese to colonise it. That doesn't necessarily make him a mastermind of slavery. That said, he was in favour of enslaving the Native Americans, and sent some Native American slaves to Queen Isabella to try and demonstrate how effective they were, but this doesn't make him responsible for slavery in Africa. \n\nThe bigger problem with this paragraph, though, lies with this line:\n\n&gt; Their mixed-race offspring were trained in the business of slavery and in fact these half-Europeans were the “Africans” that White people are referring to when they claim that “Africans sold each other.”\n\nThere's a whole post that could be written about this line alone. From what I've seen in *The Final Call* and other such publications, it's not an uncommon idea that there's no way Africans could have sold each other into slavery. There's an almost categorical denial of the idea that Africans either couldn't have known what they were doing, or that they were willing to do it anyway.\n\nThe thing about it, though, is that this idea is a bit...um...racist in its own right. It sees Africans as a monolithic people, all united in their thoughts, actions, and relations. It ignores the fact that, much like anywhere else in the world, Africans in West Africa were more likely to identify themselves as Igbo, Wolof, or Yoruba before they even thought about themselves as \"African.\" Indeed, suggesting to them that they all ought to share the same identity by virtue of all living on the same continent would have been seen as laughable, much as suggesting to a group of Europeans that they are all the same would have been laughable as well.\n\nThis idea of a united \"Africa\" strips African peoples of their own identities and cultures, and more importantly, strips them of their agency. It paints them all as pawns in someone else's game rather than as people capable of making their own decisions and understanding the consequences and repercussions of said decisions. It is, in many ways, much more dehumanising to try and paint all African peoples as united than it is to accept that there is a myriad of identities on the continent, and that each individual does, in fact, make their own choices and decisions.\n\nSuffice to say, though, that some Africans did sell other Africans into slavery. They weren't people bred to enslave by some nefarious European plot, but people who had lived on the continent and been active participants in its politics.\n\nAs an example of what the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade looked like to the non-enslaved Africans participating in it, let's look at the Oyo Empire. While it had been established in what is now modern Nigeria and Benin in the 1400s, it came into prominence by the 17th century, reaching its peak in the 18th century. It, like many other kingdoms in the area, became incredibly wealthy thanks to the Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Saharan slave trades. The Oyo would sell prisoners and criminals to slave traders, eventually getting to the point where the Oyo military was being devoted to the cause of getting enough prisoners to sell. However, as the slave trade declined, so did the Oyo economy, with the Oyo Empire having declined into oblivion by 1896. \n\nThis is a story that can be repeated with many West African kingdoms and empires. The slave trade with Europeans fuelled a need for captives and criminals and provided incredible wealth to those who could provide these slaves. Kingdoms rose and fell based on the wealth that slavery could provide, and entire regions became depopulated in raids for slaves. This is what is actually meant by \"Africans sold Africans into slavery.\" It means that kingdoms like the Oyo captured Wolof, Igbo, and other peoples and sold them to Europeans. There was none of this pan-African-ness that Mr. Muhammad seems to believe existed. Rather, there were people participating in an economic and political situation that gave some groups advantages while disadvantaging others.\n\nTo be very clear, this is not saying that Africans are the cause of the slave trade. Demand for slaves created the conditions that these groups took advantage of. However, it's equally wrong to strip the participation of these various groups and why they participated from the historical record.\n\nThe article, however, is not content to just strip various African peoples of their identities. We are then treated to this line: \n\n&gt; Englishman John Gabriel Stedman travelled in 18th century Surinam...\n\nJohn Gabriel Stedman is an interesting fellow. Much of what we know about slavery in Surinam is thanks to his work *The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam*. This work was also used by abolitionists to argue against slavery as immoral, and indeed, if you read it, it's easy to see why. The things he details are worse than what Mr. Muhammad puts in his article, and certainly make a fine case for slavery as an inhumane institution. However, Stedman wasn't English. He was Dutch-Scottish. That's pretty much the worst person to call English.\n\nWe then come to this paragraph, which starts with: \n\n&gt; Closer to home, rape was explicitly used in the plantation system to create a light-skinned buffer zone of control over the pure Africans. These mixed-race “mulattos” became the house slaves and were trained to keep the darker Africans in check and compliant with the aims of the slave owner. \n\nI searched and I searched and I searched, but I couldn't find anything to support the idea that slave owners intentionally raped their slaves to specifically create a ruling class of slaves. Now, were whiter slaves sometimes treated better than darker slaves? Yes, on occasion, though this was by no means a common thing. For instance, one famous example that was repeated throughout the slaveholding south is that of Sally Hemmings, Jefferson's slave with whom he fathered six children. That relationship was akin to concubinage, and could be seen on other plantations. Equally, mixed race slaves might have an easier time passing as white, better allowing them to escape or assimilate into society if freed. It's unlikely that slave holders intended for these effects to happen. It's also unlikely that slave holders intentionally created a legion of mixed race slaves specifically to keep darker skinned slaves oppressed. \n\nTo be clear, this is also not to say that colour differences didn't matter. They did, and to a certain extent, still do. Lighter skinned slaves were seen as generally more intelligent than darker skinned slaves, and thus were sometimes given some privileges. However, this varied from owner to owner, and certainly wasn't consistent. That said, things like paper bag tests highlight the fact that, even within the black community, lighter skinned people were seen as superior to darker skinned people. We can *still* see evidence of this in things like skin bleaching. However, this once again doesn't support the idea that rape was used to specifically create a ruling class of slaves, or indeed that a ruling class of slaves ever existed.\n\nOne way that female slaves *did* gain favour, though, outside their skin colour was if they voluntary entered into a sexual relationship with a prominent white man. This would result in special favours for them and their children, though was also dangerous as it put them in direct competition with people like the man's wife. However, both dark and light skinned slaves engaged in these relationships. \n\nMr. Muhammad continues this exploration of plantation owners' schemes with: \n\n&gt; In 1786, America’s soon-to-be first President George Washington enslaved 216 Black Africans, 92 of them children. This unusually high number of children who were unable to work his plantation indicates that George was heavily involved in the breeding of Black people for the domestic slave trade \n\nIt's interesting that Mr. Muhammad goes into Washington, especially consider that he doesn't even seem to have a particularly consistent view of Washington's attitude towards slavery. For instance, in the previous quote, he's talking about rape or at least selective breeding, but in the next line:\n\n&gt; A visitor to Washington’s plantation wrote in his diary that he felt ill treated by the President, who didn’t supply him with a female slave for his sexual enjoyment—that is to say, rape.\n\nthe author seems to redeem Washington by making him out to be a person who did not, in fact, want his slaves raped. It's a confusing narrative that Mr. Muhammad presents, so I'm just going to jump into how Washington treated his slaves.\n\nI'll start by saying that Washington was the only one of the slave-holding founders to free his slaves, albeit in his will or only after the death of his wife. There's debate about how Washington actually treated his slaves. Some accounts say he was harsh, while others say that he was very nice. We do know that whipped and threatened the slaves, as well as selling them to the West Indies as a punishment. Some of his slaves also tried to escape - or did successfully escape - on multiple occasions, suggesting that life at Mount Vernon was not, in fact, all hunky-dory. \n\nThat said, by 1778, Washington had stopped selling slaves so as not to break up families. By 1786, he was writing in his letters that he was no longer purchasing slaves, and that he was not exactly enamoured with the institution of slavery. However, during his presidency, he also signed things like the Fugitive Slave Act and provided arms to France to end the Haitian slave revolt, suggesting that, even if he didn't *like* slavery, he acknowledged its political implications. \n\nWhat all this suggests is that Washington had a complex relationship with slavery and his slaves. While he was by no means an abolitionist - to keep his slaves from being freed in Philadelphia, for instance, he left the state every six months - he also wasn't necessarily gung-ho about the institution of slavery. He likely wasn't a kind slave owner, but neither is there evidence that he serially raped his slaves. Certainly by the time period Mr. Muhammad cites, Washington was no longer selling slaves, meaning it would have been difficult for him to breed slaves to sell domestically. \n\nThis view of a rape-centric black history continues with the line:\n\n&gt; Black men cited this widespread sexual terrorism by White men as one of their prime motivations for fleeing the South in the Great Migration northward starting in the early 1900s.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned while researching this post, it's that the Great Migration had a lot of complex factors. Depending on what you read and how you interpret it, some factors become more primary than others. If you focus on secondary sources, it seems economic conditions were the driving factor behind the Great Migration. Primary sources, however, suggest that those migrating were more concerned with segregation and Jim Crow policies, though that didn't necessarily stop people from migrating first to southern cities before pressing on to the north. However, very rarely was \"rape\" a pressing concern expressed in primary sources. Lynching, yes. Rape, not so much. What those migrating sought was security and a better life through a combination of better economic and political conditions. This is not to say that rape wasn't a threat that was faced by African Americans living in the Jim Crow-era South, but it wasn't the primary reason that the Great Migration happened, as Mr. Muhammad argues. \n\nFrom here, the article goes into even worse history which, to be honest, I'm not sure how to start addressing, let alone whether or not it's worth it. Lines like:\n\n&gt; At one point New York law did not recognize the possibility of a Black woman being raped. \n\nand \n\n&gt; Jewish and Gentile women by the thousands became victims of this brutal rape-for-profit business\n\nare either completely wrong (as in, I can find no evidence that New York never recognised rape) or have no relation whatsoever to the actual topic at hand (like the second quote about the trafficking and sexual slavery of Eastern European Jewish women). It's a bizarre article, and I think it's probably for the best if I stop staring at it.\n\nI think what bothers me most about it, though, is that there's a kernel of a good idea at the heart of it. There does need to be a recapturing of black history and realisation of what black history actually is. However, rampant Afrocentrism and \"blackwashing\" of history is not the way to do it. What there needs to be is an acknowledgement of facts as they are, not facts as some would like them to be. There's enough horrors in the history of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Jim Crow South without making up demons to leap out of the pages of history books. History can be told and still make an impact without resorting to being laughably - and even racist-ly - wrong. Articles like this one, quite frankly, do more harm than good to their cause.\n\nSources:\n\n[A pair of excellent articles about the Great Migration](http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=K12-Reference&amp;prodId=UHIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CCX2876300017&amp;mode=view&amp;userGroupName=txshracd2904&amp;jsid=d28b2636152974404dcc72ff422460a4) by Elizabeth Schafer and Christopher Schmidt\n\n[Woohoo!

        "text": "I always get nervous when a topic that is near and dear to my heart hits the front page. Anything medieval tends to be a minefield of bad history, but certain topics in particular can be especially explosive. It's worth noting that I have a hard enough time keeping my socks on when discussing Magna Carta with other historians. Something about the legacy of Whig history has made any discussion of the great charter naturally prone to misunderstanding, even between scholars.\n\nAnyways, enough waxing of my own philosophical carrot. Here comes a cavalcade of misery, courtesy of u/SteveJEO:\n\n&gt;England was a bit different from your average idea of serfdom or peasantry. (there were no 'serfs' in england anyway as a concept it didn't exist.) What you had was lords, villains[sic] and free men. Lords owned land. Villains lived on the land beholden to the lord, free men could do whatever they wanted. Villains initially sound like serfs with no rights but really it's not true. They had more rights and responsibilities than free men did. Only a villain could enforce the law, mediate arguments etc. The quality of your beer and bread would be checked by a villain. Land right's and dispute regulated by villains etc. In a lot of cases it was a villain who really controlled the land and acted as both judges and accountants because lords weren't too interested in the whole 'reading' thing.\n\nOk, where to begin with this mess? This reminds me of a desperate attempt by someone who skimmed the textbook and didn't study to get partial credit on a test question. The basic elements are there, but they're all bass-ackwards. So what I think happened here is that Steve is trying to describe the position of reeve/bailiff, but having forgotten the right word, he has conflated reeves with villeins. Having done this, there are no longer villeins for the reeve to supervise, and as a result the \"villain\" is now exclusively supervising the free peasants instead of his fellow serfs. The result is a warped vision of manorial life in which serfdom disappears, and all villeins have magically transformed into sheriffs and accountants. Someone tell Richard II quick, this could save him a lot of trouble. One shudders at the thought of the poor steward who has to contend with this veritable army of bailiffs.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeve_%28England%29\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this piece of bad history is that it's clearly founded on some knowledge. SteveJEO has learned enough to know that serfdom in England was qualitatively different than on the continent, and he remembers enough from his intro course in medieval studies to offer a passable description of the functions of a reeve. This is one of those rare cases in which the devil is not in the details but actually sitting on your face.\n\nI was going to post some more examples from this thread, but I've worn myself out reading them. Someone else can take a crack at it if they really want to.",

        "text": "[So this made the front page a few days ago.](http://i.imgur.com/9bJTGY1.jpg) The tweet concerning the  Michelangelo muttering about penises while painting the ceiling fresco of the Sistine Chapel. In the absolute vaguest sense, this tweet is actually correct. Michelangelo certainly did go through his extremely rough patches while painting the ceiling, and it's not hard to imagine him taking some dark humor out of the discomfort that the more conservative of the Catholic Church would take at having male genitalia liberally spread about the Sistine Chapel. \n\nThat's the beauty about these kinds of stupid tweets. 140 characters is just enough information to be funny without making any real claims to be wrong with. That said, a deluge of \"history buffs\" who read at most two articles on ScientificAmerican.com about Michelangelo's \"secret message\" on the Sistine Chapel charge face-first into the comments section of this post with \"BRAAAAINS\" and \"DAE MICHELANGELO MASTERTROLL?!\". \n\nhttp://www.np.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/2sppz8/michaelangelo_dont_care/\n\n&gt;There is some truth to this...\n\nBoy, I can't wait to hear this.^[sarcasm]^[lol]\n\n&gt;Michelangelo tried to refuse the commission to paint the Sistine Chapel (he considered himself a sculptor not a painter) and as the story goes he accepted it under duress and was actually slapped by Pope Julius II for painting too slowly.\n\nYeah, that's why he tried to refuse the commision, and not because of Michelangelo had devoted his soul, his heart and three years of his life to constructing the [Tomb of Julius II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Pope_Julius_II), and this was to be his greatest work ever, and KNOWING that being assigned to the Sistine Chapel's ceiling fresco would likely mean the tomb would never be finished-- a problem that was epidemic among Michelangelo's projects. Abandoning the Tomb must have been heartbreaking for Michelangelo. Sure, he might have some professional misgivings about painting, his specialty was marble sculpture. He had the same damn misgivings about [the bronze statue he casted for Pope Julius II as well.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aworlds_media/ibase_1/00/13/08/00130888_000.jpg) Didn't stop him from he still devoting his full intensity to the project.\n\nBut what am I saying? This is r/BlackPeopleTwitter where white people go to laugh (at/with?) black people being funny. I'm clearly expecting too much from them. *\"...non era mia arte\"* (I dun like painting)  is why Michelangelo refused the commission out of such *great concern* for his professional ability to accomplish such a task, a hur dur dur. \n\n&gt;Beyond giving some offence by painting nudes, something that was not common at the time, the panel called \"The Creation of Adam\" is said to show a human brain, which could be considered another dig at the Church.\n\n(A different person below)\n\n&gt;Michelangelo also studied dead people but did it illegally. He would sneak into a mortuary and dissect the cadavers at night and then then wrapped them back up and went back home at dawn only to do it again the next night.\n\nOVERALL TRANSLATION:\n\n\"Since Michelangelo attended dissections of the human body, he would be familiar the anatomy of the brain. Too familiar to have accidentally painted something on the Sistine Chapel ceiling that a few doctors hundreds of years later considered to look like a brain, or a goiter, or a kidney or whatever the fuck have you. I buy glue sometimes just to eat.\"\n\n Is this making any sense? It shouldn't. It is true that dissections were a common way for artists to refine their craft and strive for a more lifelike portrayal of the human figure. That said, the majority of artists were also largely confined to the muscular-skeletal portion of the body-- the most relevant portions to the art of sculpting and painting, obviously. The organs of the human body and the brain would have been considered to be secondary importance to detailed study of the muscles and bones.\n\nALSO these dissections were in no way illegal. Fuck the neckbeard (probably some Protestant Reformist looking to trash the Catholic Church a good 500 years ago come to think of it) who first came up with that \"theory\" since it's been a long few centuries of playing whack-a-mole with this ideal. back in reality, a seventeen-year old Michelangelo, using his connections with Lorenzo \"the Magnificent\" di Medici, befriended the prior of the church of Santo Spirito who permitted the young sculpter to perform some dissections in the morgue. Michelangelo even carved the prior a [wooden crucifix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifix_%28Michelangelo%29) as thanks for the arrangement. \n\nALSO:\n\n&gt;He would sneak into a mortuary and dissect the cadavers at night **and then then wrapped them back up and went back home at dawn only to do it again the next night.**\n\nGod, fuck you.\n\n&gt;This was pre-Byzantine correct? IIRC nudity was a huge taboo in Byzantine\n\nA herpderp [Fall of Costantinople](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople) don't real.\n\n&gt;This tweet is pretty accurate, really. \n\nLiterally the only thing right that's been said so far.\n\n&gt;The Pope had originally just wanted the 12 Apostles painted. Michaelangelo reluctantly accepted the commission and went on to paint the ceiling the way he envisioned it, regardless of what the Pope ordered. He didn't think nudity should be something to be ashamed of (and it wasn't when Adam was created), so that's how he depicted the scene.\n\nUm, we have plenty of evidence that Michelangelo deigned to argue his case to the Pope, who acceded. This was a negotiation. They were people. *They talked*. Do these people seriously believe that Michelangelo would have painted something TOTALLY DIFFERENT from what he was asked without informing the pope first? Would he just stand at the doorway to the Sistine Chapel and wave the pope away for four years saying \"no you can't come in yet I'm totally doing what you asked lol\".\n\n And these people are taking Vasari and Condivi out of fucking context again-- Vasari being Vasari and Michelangelo advising Condivi's arguably more accurate biography still had a vested interest in making himself look good. Part of that was being \"cool and rebellious\" to the pope. Not that anyone in this fucking thread would even realize they were falling for a 500-year old artist's self-aggradanizing tactics. \n\n&gt;Julius eventually came around to love the ceiling, but he was still kind of a dick.\n\nI hate to see what future historiography would be like if reading three internet articles grants someone the authority to label anyone they know nothing about a \"dick\".\n\n\n&gt;I know everybody here is about jokes but heres an interesting theory i saw a few years ago: Sisteen chapel (the building he painted the cieling on) is part of a church. The most iconic image in the painting is god reaching for adams hand. If you look at the shell around god and the way his leg sticks out of the shell it perfectly overlays onto an mri of a human brain in the profile view.\n\nYeah because Renaissance Italy was known for it's high quality MRI scans, just behind their innovations in open heart surgery and penicillin.  And sure, I bet everyone's brain stem sticks out at a 45* angle out the back of their neck in a tube just like Mewtwo, because that's what it would take for the *Creation of Adam* to \"perfectly overlay\" an MRI of a human brain. [Note how God's feet disappear from the right hand side of the superimposed brain.](http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/wp-content/blogs.dir/263/files/2012/04/i-8f3e98954abf5fe1ae31ef7866873835-paluzzisistine.jpg) Godfucking science magazine blogs tryna be art history majors.\n\n&gt;In addition, he painted a panel titled \"Zachary\" with the face of the pope, who was ecstatic to be the face of such a huge figure in Christianity. What he didn't see was that Michelangelo painted an angel giving him their \"middle finger\" which at the time was passing your thumb between your index and middle finger. So Michelangelo basically flipped off the pope for eternity.\n\nAs soon as I get my \"Discovering Michelangelo\" delivered I will shit over this so much you guys don't even know.\n\n\nBONUS:\n\n&gt;&gt;This is probably the most I have learned from a black people twitter link. \n&gt;Forgot I as in bpt after reading the comments\n\n",

        "text": "Presentism! It's bad.\n\nNow that we've got that over with, the question is how do you explain that to people? First let's get a solid understanding of what it is. Presentism is the application of present day perspectives, laws, morals, definitions, understandings, or ideas to the past. This is rather frowned upon by the majority of historians.^1 However, while much of the historical community frowns upon it, large swathes of the general public are guilty of rampant presentism, especially those with an agenda, the uninformed, or producers of 'pop-history'.^2 What can we few, we drunken few, we band of badhistorians, do about that?^3 We can correct them. Sounds simple, right? As I found out recently, it turns out it's not. So, I'm now trying to write a relatively simple resource to enable you to explain to the layperson all about presentism.\n\n*****\n\nPresentism often can be boiled down to the following:\n&gt;\"X Historical figure or concept^4 was Y^5\"   \n\nThis is the generic form of it, but I've pulled some more complex Sappho related ones from tumblr. \n\nFor privacy's sake I'm not going to give the blogs or link to the posts these are from.\n\n&gt;For all your Queer Valentines &lt;3  \nDid you know that fella-loving-fellas and lady-loving-ladies have our own unique “courtship flowers” that go all the way back to Ancient Greece? \nFor the fellas, there’s Green Carnations, which were often worn in the lapel of queer men (most famously Oscar Wilde) as a signal of sexuality to other savvy queer men.  \nAnd for the ladies, we have Violets, which became associated with **sapphic women thanks to Sappho (bisexual mother of all lesbians)**, who wrote poetry about adorning her lovers with them.  \nSo if roses aren’t really your thing, get your boo some queer flowers and wow them with your knowledge of our history!^6\n\n^(Bold sections done for emphasis)\n\nThe issue here is that Sappho is being branded with the term \"Bisexual\", a concept which did not exist in its modern form when she was alive. As /u/daeres explained in the badsubhub IRC: \n    \n    \"it's also not liable to be true anyway, because\n    Sappho's poems are a) mostly fragmentary and \n    b) almost always written for clients i.e it's meant to \n    take the client's POV, not her own [meaning] that the \n    content of the poems implies nothing about her sexual \n    preferences [and they are] the only source we have \n    ever had access to \"\n\nOn to the next post:\n\n&gt;Heavily considering getting a tattoo of a violet on my wrist.  \n    Sappho used to give her female lovers violets.  \n    I just want to decorate myself in queer art and symbolism.  \n\nAgain, there is this application of modern terms, communities, identities, and/or movements to this historical figure. That's presentist. You can't say Sappho was queer because 'queer' didn't exist when she was alive. This is not to detract from the queer community, or to maliciously take away a symbol of their struggle, but it is the height of presentism to ascribe current conceptualizations of gender and sexuality to a figure who may or may not fit into that categorization in part or whole. This is not to say that such behavior is exclusive to any one group. For each person saying \"X historical figure was gay\" there's another claiming someone to have been an MRA, or TRPer, or a fascist, or any other social or political movement. The use of tumblr and Sappho is just because it's a relatively simple thing for me to find and explain.\n\n****\nThe other major form presentism takes is, roughly \"X group should have invented Y because it's obvious, because people in the past were dumb\"\n\n For example, see [this post on steam engines, greece, and the \"inevitable march of progress\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1r5qpa/in_which_cgpgrey_gets_dangerously_close_to_the/)\n\nThe thing about this type of presentism is that it implies that there is an inevitability to history, a linear progression from the unenlightened shittyness of the past towards a brighter future. This is also present in Whig and Marxian historiography, as well as \"The Chart\". It's wrong, deterministic, simplistic, and bad. This one is easier to refute, generally by explaining that history has no narrative. This sort of presentist historiography is really prevalent in the historiography of science, especially due to the popularity of the 'Civ V tech tree' view of the history of science.\n\n****\nTo take a step back and look at this in a more general context, the application of present concepts and perspectives to the past displays an attitude of temporal superiority that is simply wrong. There is a fine balance to be made. To be totally morally relativistic would be absurd, but one cannot fall into the trap of looking at the past through the eyes of the present. It's a complex issue, but a necessary one for people to understand as they look at history, even as a layperson.\n\n****\n\n1. [See here, first sentence](http://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-2002/against-presentism)\n\n2. This is anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt, but in my experience it holds up.\n\n3. I mean other than write large pedantic tracts about it like we already do. Oh, and also other than drink.\n\n4. Napoleon, The lady in the lake, Lincoln, joan of arc, Shakespeare, Caesar, one of the innumerable unimportant pope innocent or piuses, Hitler, Ancient fill in the blank with a modern country etc.\n\n5. Gay, Straight, MRA, mormon, jewish, genderqueer, genderfluid, communist, trans, Libertarian, An-Cap, et cetera\n\n6. I checked with /u/daeres about the historiocity of the rest of this too, it's bunk.",

If I had to guess, I'd say during that time period, a lot of people lived more agrarian lives, and worked as a family together. Not so much the husband \"has a job\" and the wife is a \"stay at home mother\" or anything like that, but rather the family as a whole works for the success of the household. The \"man has a job\" thought seems like modern cultural terms, and not something that could be applied to that time period.\n\nSo which one of us has the bad history? Am I wrong to assume an agrarian culture in that time period? Or is he wrong? Or are we both wrong? Any one who could point me to some resources on this would be greatly appreciated! It's hard finding resources on this without a bias or an agenda. \n\nBonus: Does anyone have some historical reference to what it's referring to when it talks about the husband at the city gates?

We know that the Greeks had some fairly impressive voyages, but I've never heard any theory that they made it to the Americas before.\n\n&gt; The only plausible explanation for these findings is that a considerable number of transoceanic voyages in both directions across both major oceans were completed between the 7th millennium BC and the European age of discovery.\n\nThis is my favourite quote. Which findings can only be explained by \"a considerable number of transoceanic voyages\"? Which can only be explained by *any* transoceanic voyages, for that matter?",

        "text": "*Mankind: The Story of All of Us* Knows Next to Nothing about the Portuguese Age of Discovery\n\nI'm going to go ahead and admit that the History Channel is a low-hanging fruit. However, I was appalled by the way it handled the Age of Discovery in Portugal. This information appears primarily in the fifth episode, entitled \"Survivors\". This is the first time Portugal is deemed worthy of real mention. This in spite of the fact that Portugal was the first European nation to expand its territory to its present borders. \n\nThe first thing that caught my attention in this episode was the mention of the Portuguese having “invented the lateen sail”. That is an obvious misconception. Here's a little bit on the etymology of the word lateen: it seems to be a anglicized spelling of French *latine*, meaning Latin, a reference to its use in the [Mediterranean sea.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateen#Introduction_into_Mediterranean_Sea). Yes, that's a Wikipedia link, but notice: even Wikipedia knows that the lateen sail predates the merest *idea* of Portugal. \n\nWhat they probably meant to say was that the Portuguese invented the *caravela latina* (the lateen caravel), a small vessel of 20-80 tons with one to three masts, each with a lateen sail. These could only carry about 25 men.  These could sail closer to the wind than other ships and maneuvered well both in costal waters and the high seas. It was later refined as the *caravela redonda* with one mast having a square sail instead of a lateen sail, which let it catch more wind in aft. (Disney 40) \n\nAnother Portuguese innovation that was pretty much the secret to their success was the *volta do mar* (literally \"return from the sea\"). Without this technique, it would have been far more difficult for the Portuguese expeditions to return to Lisbon. Instead of following the African coast north, which required them to go against the currents, they would instead head in a northwest direction; once they caught the westerlies, they would sail northeast to Lisbon. (ibid.)  [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_do_mar#mediaviewer/File:Henrican_navigation_routes.gif) is a depiction of the volta do mar on a map. It helped that the Portuguese kept very good records of their voyages.\n\nThe next part that surprised me is that Bartolomeu Dias is the only Portuguese explorer that the makers of *Mankind the Story of Us* feels is fit to mention. They completely ignore the expeditions sponsored by the Infante D. Henrique, better known in English as Prince Henry the Navigator. He was the first to sponsor expeditions exploring Africa. He is seen as important even today: \"recent polls indicate that in North America he is generally placed among the twenty-five most important personages of the past millennium\" (Disney 28). His explorations were quite difficult.  He sponsored his first expeditions soon after the conquest of Ceuta in 1415; his squire Gil Eanes did not manage to round Cape Bojador in Morocco, the extent of the known world at that time, until 1434. Eanes did it on his third try, in a barca (a square-rigged ship; not a caravel). (31) And yet, this process is not worth a mention. \n\n Then, they decided to ignore the first explorer employed by King João II, Henrique's nephew who continued his work. This was a commoner named Diogo Cão. He found and explored the Congo river and managed to reach Cape Cross in Namibia in 4 years, doing as much as had been done in the previous 20 years. Soon after his return, King João commissioned Bartolomeu Dias. (35-37).\n\nIn conclusion, I will admit that it is a bit much to expect that a mini-series on world history go in depth on this kind of information. But I affirm that *Mankind: The Story of Us* did its research poorly and that this resulted in misinformation being spread about the Portuguese Age of Discovery.  \n\n\nSource\nDisney, A.R. *A History of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009. *The Portuguese Empire*. Vol. 2 of 2. Print. 28, 31, 35-47, 40. \n\n\nEdit: This post was partly inspired by [this earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2uac8l/mankind_the_story_of_us_the_story_of_bad/) by /u/Tiako. He had the first idea to do a post on this; I remembered something I had heard while watching the series out of boredom and decided to do a different post. I think the reason we both watched the series around the same time is its apparently recent release on Netflix. \n\nEdit2: I just wanted to roundly endorse the book I used. I think Disney has written the best history of Portugal in English. It does a good job of showing alternative viewpoints and justifying its position, and it covers Portuguese history from prehistory to 1807 in some detail. The bibliography is extensive and includes primary and secondary sources in English, Portuguese, French, Italian and Spanish. I heartily recommend it as an introduction to Portuguese history for English speakers who are interested. ",

        "text": "I was recently indulging in an internet trivia game, having a grand old time, when suddenly, the game decided to try to pull a fast one on me. It threw [this question](http://i.imgur.com/PIjC9b7.png) in my face and expected me to answer it. For a moment, I was flabbergasted. After all, I had no reason to suspect that this otherwise innocent and silly quiz would commit such a heinous crime as trying to pass off bad history as actual history. Once I recovered from the shock, however, I laughed in the quiz's face. Trying to convince me that you know more about the history of cosmetics than I do? Ha! The nerve!\n\nOne of the first problems when looking at where cosmetics were first used is in defining what is an is not a \"cosmetic.\" Someone accidentally getting mud or dust on their face probably doesn't qualify as \"using cosmetics,\" but what about someone intentionally splattering mud on themselves in a meaningful pattern? We generally think of cosmetics as needing to be manufactured, and certainly, that's the assumption that this trivia question is based on, but is it necessarily an accurate one?\n\nFor instance, if we assume that cosmetics needed to be something that was manufactured, then the earliest archaeological evidence we have for cosmetics dates back around 6000 years in more places than just Egypt. In Egypt, we have evidence of [henna being used as a hair dye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna#Body_art), giving ancient Egyptians bright red hair. The evidence of henna use increases the closer we get to the present, but dyed objects in tombs and such suggest that it was being used. Tombs have also included face creams and balms that likely served as sunscreen, as well as making faces smell nice. Murals and busts also show Egyptian women wearing eyeliner made of kohl, a lead sulfide and herb combination that came in a variety of colours, but mostly black. Unsurprisingly, there were side effects to this. Later developments would include mixing it with frankincense in some of the first recorded uses of the resin.\n\nWhat's interesting about kohl, though, is that it's debatable whether the Egyptians were the first to use it. While little is known about it, one of Egypt's trading partners was the kingdom of Punt (and I swear, I can write about them without giggling to myself). Pretty much everything we know about Punt, we know from the Egyptians, who first start writing about it in the 26th century BCE (or, more specifically, writing about the stuff they got from Punt). Some of the things that Egypt got from Punt included ebony, myrrh, gold, and materials that could have been used to make kohl. However, since there are few depictions of Punt (except for [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Queen_of_punt.jpg) lovely bit of art), it's hard to say whether they themselves were using kohl, or if they were just exporting the materials for it. Either way, kohl is certainly endemic to the Horn area, and there are historians that argue it's been there for a very, very long time.\n\nAt the very least, then, we have at least one instance of cosmetics that could possibly be contemporary with ancient Egyptian cosmetics, if not a predecessor. However, there are instances of cosmetics outside Africa as well, once again almost contemporary with Egypt. \n\nIn India, for instance, we find evidence dating from around five thousand years ago of mehndi (another form of henna where the henna is mixed with turmeric) being used as ritual paint and as nail polish. It became more firmly a part of Indian and Hindu culture when it was mentioned and incorporated into the Vedas in the 2nd millennium BCE.\n\nAround the same time (3000 BCE), another form of nail polish was being developed in china. This used a base of egg whites and beeswax with dyes to turn fingernails different colours. By the Chou dynasty, gold dust was added in to create new and more vivid colours, though all these colours carried with them distinct social implications. \n\nIn addition to this nail polish, we also have evidence of lead-based cosmetics dating back to around 3000 BCE. These were rare, however, and it's not until the Chou dynasty that it becomes more common to see face paints. These paints were made from massicot or orpiment, which gave them a yellow tinge that was highly desirable during the Chou dynasty. Really, the number of names for various shades of yellow that women wore is itself indicative of what could be done with these early cosmetics. Over time, red and white also became more popular, though yellow continued to be seen as an auspicious colour into the T'ang Dynasty. \n\nOf course, all of this goes off the initial assumption that cosmetics themselves must be made of some combination of chemicals or ingredients to qualify as cosmetics. I don't happen to agree with that definition. After all, many body paints used around the world aren't much more than ochres or pigments (though perhaps the fact that I use the term \"body paint\" to refer to them rather than \"cosmetics\" might be more revealing than I intend for it be). If we expand the definition of \"cosmetics\" to include these sorts of pigments and body paints - things that are unquestionably decorative - then the question of \"first use of cosmetics\" goes much, much farther back in history. \n\nSome of the oldest known evidence for body painting comes from places like [Pinnacle Point](http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/early-human-marine-resources-pigment-south-africa-during-middle-pleistocene-2/#) in South Africa. At Pinnacle Point, there is evidence for not only an exploitation of marine foods like shellfish, but also early evidence of \"symbolic behaviour,\" namely evidence of ochre and body paints. It's debated exactly how old this is, but the article I linked suggests that this dates back to between 135 and 75 thousand years ago. To be clear, this is debated, and some archaeologists don't accept this estimate, instead preferring to say that pigments and other evidence of clear, conscious thought dates back around 40 000 years. However, either way, it still stretches well beyond the 6000 years that the trivia question implies. \n\nSo what's the actual answer to the trivia question? The answer that they're likely looking for is Egypt, though there's some evidence that both India and China could be acceptable answers. The real answer, though, is that doodling on ourselves is probably as old as humanity itself. \n\nSources:\n\nHaft Qalam Arayish: cosmetics in the Iranian world by Fatema Soudavar Farmanfarmaian in the journal Iranian Studies (I didn't actually cite it in the post, but I read it and enjoyed it, so by god, you will too)\n\nA Cosmetic Palette from Umm el-Biyara by Crystal Bennett in Antiquity (I didn't cite this one either, but it's a really good look at one instance of the evolution and spread of cosmetics in the ancient Near East.

This is, without exaggeration, one of the most important works of anthropology ever written and it is only a couple pages long! Beyond that, er, I suppose Brian Fagen's *Cro-Magnon* and Barry Cunliffe (ed) *Prehistoric Europe* are excellent sources on paleolithic society. They focus on Europe, but hey, so does the show. For the Neolithic, Bellwood's *First Farmers*, for Egypt the *Oxford History of Ancient Egypt* is the best single volume history. For any other issue I am happy to provide a source.\n\nI had never actually heard of this History/Discovery Channel Documentary series until it popped up on my Netflix, and I will admit I decided to watch it in large part because I thought it would make a good submission to /r/badhistory. And boy, was I right. This stuff is just silly. The documentary is generally broken into couple minute segments, so I will be following that with time stamps.\n\nSo the series, as I take it, is attempting to tell THE STORY OF HUMANITY. This would be an interesting show if it were done by, say, the BBC and narrated by Michael Wood. Instead it is done by the History Channel and narrated by Josh Brolin. I have nothing against Josh Brolin--*The Goonies* was a great movie--but he is a somewhat idiosyncratic choice for narrator. I'm not entirely certain how else I can mock the idea of Josh Brolin narrating a documentary series as arrogantly named as [MANKIND: THE STORY OF ALL OF US](http://www.history.com/shows/mankind-the-story-of-all-of-us) but there we go.\n\nAnyway, we open on a group of hunters. Man hunters, it is worth noting, as these are *men*, manly men. I'm mocking this decision because it opens by saying it is recreating a scene with Y-chromosomal Adam, or the most recent common source of Y-chromosomes. This particular person is significantly more recent than mitochondrial Eve (let's say 70 kya [ed: 1000 years ago] vs. 150 kya between friends) and is also significantly less well genetically understood. But he has one advantage: he is a MAN, a MANLY MAN who hunts game with his spear by running them down despite the fact that a pronghorn antelope can run at over 60 km/hr. I'm also mocking the masculine ideology here because it continually emphasizes that if Y-Adam does not bring home his game, starvation looms. Well, not quite. Hunter gatherers have a deep knowledge of their surroundings and thus almost never face starvation because they know the plat foods they can gather nearby. So generally speaking, wifey waiting back home has already gathered the food neccesary for subsistence with a few hours labor--meat gathered through hunting is a bonus in terms of protein, flavor and social bonding, but is not a subsistence necessity. But I suppose this documentary isn't going to be subverting any notion of \"man the provider\".\n\nThe other reason I suspect that is that the credentials of the first expert is \"former Navy SEAL\" and no, I am not joking. Beyond that, I have so far (at 9:00) seen a \"writer\", a \"doctor\", Anthony Bourdain, Brian Williams, and Henry Louis Gates. I have great affection for the last three and am sure the others are lovely people, but six talking heads and not a single one belongs to an anthropologist? Brolin forfend!\n\n[~9:00]Now, entering the actual narrative, it begins with the Toba Eruption, which is somewhat controversial but fair enough. It is worth noting that human movement out of Africa was probably due to the so-called \"Saharan Pump\", that is, the gradual wettening(?)/desiccation of the Sahara that draws human populations into the desert then pushes them out. I won't even comment on the date because honestly 70 kya is good enough, but it is a bit grating to hear--from Henry Louis Gates of all people!--that this is when humanity's story begins. **NO**. Humanity's story begins *in Africa* and the vast majority of it has been spent *in Africa*. This is the latest version of a very old narrative that Africans are somehow not full participants in the human story.\n\n[~10:30] So now we pick up at the Ice Age, leaving aside the dull complexity of the lower/upper paleolithic transition (essentially the change between *homo neanderthalensis* and *homo sapiens*) because who need that evolution stuff? Anyway, right off the bat they establish this as a cold, unforgiving and harsh land, but in reality the Upper Paleolithic was not the wasteland it is often portrayed as, it was a feeding frenzy. The continent of Europe which is now agriculture over forest was basically open grassland dominated by herds of megafauna. The hunting was so rich that human populations could attain an incredible degree of specialization--90% of a particular species going by bone remains. This isn't a human population at he edge, this is a *thriving* population, with wide trading contacts and rich sources of hunting supplies. But of course that isn't what we will see here.\n\n[12:00] So after a bit of silliness about wolves, it starts to blabber on about “the great leap forward”. This was an idea held in anthropology due to a drastic change in human material remains around, say 50 kya. This was once a subject of considerable debate, but with more research outside of Europe we can see the idea of a “great leap forward” is actually high Eurocentric. What this actually represents is a change from Neanderthal populations to *homo sapiens*, and so no, this is not when we first see stitching and the like. It is also worth noting that, unlike what the show states, it does not seem that caves were common habitation sites.\n\n[13:39] PUPPY\n\n[17:10] Well, this is arguably the worst narrative of how farming started. Now for a quick biology talk, the difference between wild and domestic wheat is that the rachis—essentially what holds the seed to the stalk—degrades in wild wheat so it falls to the ground. The tendency to fall to the ground is selected for in wild conditions, however, when humans are gathering grain stalks, the ability of a seed to stick on the stalk will be selected for. The show portrays the development of agriculture as simply the realization that seeds turn into stalks—in reality, hunter gatherer societies understand this very well and exploit it at times. But the plant has a say too.\n\nOK, one more thing, for one, it shows the First Woman Farmer as having a fenced in enclosure which, I mean, such ideology! My god! Secondly, it says this crop conquers the globe. In reality, wheat cultivation was between, say, Gujarat and the Atlantic, rice cultivation was east of that, and beyond those it gets very complicated indeed. Long story short: it takes more than one crop to make a Neolithic.\n\n[18:30] So, it appears that Josh Brolin just claimed that agriculture reached southern England in 3000 BCE, leading to villages, “mankind's first settled communities”. The Neolithic reached Britain probably around 5000, but more securely 4000 BCE. This is about the beginning of the Uruk Period in Mesopotamia (essentially, the period of large scale urbanization), so you can imagine how ridiculous it is to call this “mankind's first settled communities”. Worth noting that there were permanent settlements before agriculture.\n\n[26:25] So we have shifted from villages to Stonehenge—the interpretation pushed here is of a monument to the dead, which is still valid although complicated by recent research in the area—to Egypt. I don't have real objections here, as the segment emphasizes that the workers were skilled craftsmen and not mindless slaves, but I shoukld not that depsite what it sayd, writing is not neccesary to large public works! The Inca, to name one, show that.\n\n[30:00] So now it starts talking about urbanization, even though as I noted that story had begun well before the pyramids and Stonhenge. Anyway, I just want to note that everyone is wearing turbans and veils and that no, contemporary Arab populations are not good analogues for neolithic (or bronze age, because we seem to have skipped the Neolithic) Mesopotamia.\n\n[35:00] THE ORIGINS OF TRADE! Well, not really. As I alluded to before, people in the Paleolithic had extensive trading connections that we can trace through the exchange of various materials, especially obsidian which traveled hundreds of miles. We also see trade in flint, shells and other prestige materials during the Neolithic. Now what is interesting about the Bronze Age, in particularly starting about a thousand years before what I think is the Old Assyrian in the video, is that trade begins to consist of subsistence items and everyday materials, particularly stone for tools. This is largely not discussed in the show.\n\n[35:00] Alright, so we are about to get what I assume is a very stupid account of the Battle of Megiddo. I will say if it isn't stupid.\n\n[End] Yeah it was pretty dumb (this isn't a gimmick, I actually did wait to write this). I appreciate the ethnic diversity in the Pharoah's ranks and Thutmose III deserves more credit than he gets in pop culture, but generally, kind of dumb.\n\nSo what can I say? Does it give a good account of Paleolithic man? No, it does not. Does it give a good account of the Neolithic revolution? Well, it depends on whether you think domestication is important to that. Does it give a good account of anything? No, not really. But it has lots of MANALY MEN and plenty of US Marine Corp (hoo rah! amirite) giving intense stares into the camera while they talk about premodern warfare for some reason.\n\nIn short, it is exactly what I thought it would be, so I give it to you. Upvotes pls.\n\nIncidentally, of the talking heads, zero were anthropologists, archaeologists, or historians.",

This period is traditionally understood to have begun during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (786 to 809) with the inauguration of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world's knowledge into Arabic.\n\n\"experiencing a scientific, economic, and cultural flourishing...\" that doesn't exactly sound like Islam \"ruined everything.\" And while I do admit that Muslim people have done terrible things in the name of Islam, I believe that saying that Islam \"ruined everything\" is way too extreme without even trying to acknowledge the contributions made by Muslims.  \n\nYou have stuff like [algebra:](http://www.und.edu/instruct/lgeller/algebra.html)\n&gt;The word algebra is a Latin variant of the Arabic word al-jabr. This came from the title of a book, Hidab al-jabr wal-muqubala, written in Baghdad about 825 A.D. by the Arab mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi.\n\nThen you have goddamn [Hindu–Arabic numeral system:](https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Arabic_numerals.html)\n&gt;The Indian numerals were adopted by the Persian mathematicians in India, and passed on to the Arabs further west.

But if you're gonna say that the Middle East was great before Islam was introduced and everything thereafter was ruined, at least make a good comparison of what happened before and after that. Ffs, much of what we call \"the modern world\" is a result of scientific advancements which happened in the Muslim world.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2u5xhw/womens_ideal_body_types_throughout_history/",
        "text": "Buzzfeed recently released a [video on women's ideal body types throughout history](http://www.buzzfeed.com/eugeneyang/womens-ideal-body-types-throughout-history#.wyX183raE), and I kinda applaud the attempt to do a serious examination of how beauty standards have changed over time and across cultures. Unfortunately, the video is riddled with enough historical inaccuracies to kinda compromise the project.\n\nSome of the eras I don't know enough about to say anything meaningful – New Kingdom Egypt, Han China and the Renaissance – so this write-up is going to be a bit low effort, but I'm curious if any of you have any input! (Also note I'll not talk about the 80s, 90s and 2000s because R2.)\n\n**General Points**\n\nWe have a fair idea that fashions changed in the past about as quickly as they change today. Julius Caesar was meant to be a trend-setter in how he wore his tunic, and I know Alcibiades made the flute unfashionable in his day. As such, I think it's naive to imagine that beauty standards were static over hundreds of years, or across cities/regions, even if certain traits stayed in fashion for a long time (i.e. small feet in China). I also think it's easy to cherry pick: to select one or two 'beauties' from a time, and extrapolate from that an ideal beauty. To some extent I think this is inevitable where you have only limited sources, but it's a problem when you're ignoring known counter-examples and especially when you're trying to make a moral argument that's meant to sway or convince us moderns.\n\nIt's also heavily weighted towards the West and the 20th Century, which is a bit lazy. Also: holy anachronisms, batman! Ancient Egypt was 'sex-positive'? That term carries a whole heap of modern connotations that you can't really apply to a civilisation that's over three-thousand years old.\n\n**Ancient Greece (500-300 BCE)**\n\n&gt; Aristotle called the female form “a deformed male,” so yeah — ancient Greece was pretty male-centric. The ancient Greeks were more focused on the ideal male physique than women’s, meaning that it was the men of this time period, rather than the women, who had to live up to high standards of physical perfection. This sounds good, except that this meant women were body-shamed for not looking like men.\n\nAristotle might have thought of women as 'deformed males', but his views were hardly representative of Greek society. That would be like assuming Dawkin's ideals reflect 21st Century society. And women were 'body-shamed' for not looking like men? How would we know that? Is there a line in *The Birds* where a fishmonger complains of his wife's narrow shoulders and unseemly hips? The Classical Greeks obviously had a love affair with the male form, but it's speculative to say they therefore found the female form to be shame-worthy.\n\nDespite that, I do think it's fair to say that the Venus of Cnidus (which they used as their example) demonstrates that Athenians did find a 'plump' figure to be attractive. But over in Sparta they [valued women with an athletic figure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Youth), which reinforces my earlier point that you can't really generalise about an entire region and period of history with one example.\n\nBonus badhistory: commenter Krista Drummond writes 'the reason Ancient Greek (and later periods as a result because they used Greek statues as a model) women are portrayed manly is because they could not get females to pose nude so artists would have a male model pose and modify the work to look like a woman'. I know this is probably true of Michelangelo, but the Cnidus Venus was modelled on Phryne who was, amongst other things, a woman. I suspect this is an example of someone knowing one thing about classical art and using that to generalise about all classical art.\n\n**Victorian England (c. 1837 - 1901)**\n\nCommenter Piper Ferguson has this one:\n\n&gt; The images and hairstyle you used for the Victorian section are incorrect. What you are demonstrating is actually the Edwardian Ideal Body. The Victorian era began in 1837 ended in 1901. There are similarities between Victorian and Edwardian ideal body types, but they are not the same. The generic silhouette for the Victorian period is the classic cinched waist enhanced by exaggerated shoulders and bell shaped skirts to create a trompe l'oeil to make a lady's waist look smaller than it actually was. The photograph you used was an advertisement for the modern 1903 \"health\", or as we know it today, the S-Bend corset as characterized by it's distinctive construction that thrusts a lady's ribcage forward while pulling the hips back to create a distinctive S-shaped profile, as well as it's standard underbust detailing. The hairstyle that the model presents is called the Gibson Girl chignon, a coiffure popularized by actress Camille Clifford and Charles Gibson's pen and ink caricatures between 1901 and 1911.\n\n**Golden Age Of Hollywood (c. 1930s - 1950s)**\n\nThe model is meant to be Marilyn Monroe: you can tell by them having Marilyn in the background, the model's poses, and the fact the model used the hashtag #MillennialMarilyn on her [instagram](http://instagram.com/vivalasantana). The model, Sierra Santana, is perfectly beautiful, but she is no Marilyn. Just compare their measurements. (Felt a bit skeezy googling her measurements, but she's a model so I knew they'd be easily accessible.)\n\n[Sierra Santana](http://www.modelmayhem.com/2038269):\n\n* Height: 5' 7\"\n* Weight: 155 lbs\n* Bust: 38\"\n* Waist: 29\"\n* Hips: 41\"\n* Cup: DD\n* Dress: 10\n\n[Marilyn Monroe](http://jezebel.com/5299793/for-the-last-time-what-size-was-marilyn-monroe):\n\n* Height: 5 feet, 5½ inches\n* Weight: 118-140 pounds\n* Bust: 35-37 inches\n* Waist: 22-23 inches\n* Hips: 35-36 inches\n* Bra size: 36D\n\nI think it's worth noting here just why Marilyn is considered such a bombshell. Her hour-glass figure is just fuck-off ridiculous. Nobody has those measurements, so it's no discredit that Sierra doesn't. But, yeah, key points: Marilyn was not just shorter and lighter, but her bust/hips are nearly identical and her waist is *tiny* in proportion. They're both 'curvy' women, but aside from that their figures are not even remotely comparable.\n\nSo why was the model used? There's an urban myth that Marilyn was a 16 dress size. She was actually an 8-10, and Sierra is a 10, so you can see why Sierra was chosen. Except that Sierra is a *US* 10, while Marilyn was a *British* 8-10, [which is more like a US 4-6](http://www.modelmayhem.com/2038269) or even a modern 2 (given vanity sizing). An honest mistake to make, but still bad history.\n\nIn fairness, though, commentator Kay Grimes makes the point that contemporary actresses 'Mae West Jane Russell had an athletic curvy body and she stated in her autobiography 130 to 140 was her \"fighting weight\" at 5'7 – very much in shape but not what most would called slim at all.' That's the same height as Sierra and not too far off in terms of weight. But they don't look *that* similar, and the comparison with Marilyn is still off.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think you can definitely make the case that beauty is informed by culture, and that our beauty standards have changed a lot over the past. And I also sympathise with efforts to reduce the sort of stigma that women and, to a lesser extent, men are subjected to because of their bodies. But I don't think this is achieved by promoting the idea that there is only ever one ideal body type in an era, or by using lazy and selective historical research to try and make a political point. At best, you only end up convincing the people who already agreed with you and alienating those people who disagree.",

I often rail against the “death by disease alone” myth of conquest. Though I’m fascinated by the subject, I intentionally tried to keep this post below 2,000 words to not exhaust your patience. If you would like more in-depth analysis check out the “More Information” section for some of my longer posts on the topic, and feel free to ask further questions. As always, if you see any errors, let me know so I can fix them and learn from my mistakes. Scholars of the Americas, feel free to add information from your areas of research.\n\nHere we go…\n\n**The Myth: Universal &gt; 95% Mortality from Introduced Infectious Organisms**\n\nThe dominant narrative of Native American population decline after contact cites introduced infectious diseases as the chief mechanism of widowing the Americas of its original inhabitants. Per the myth, Native Americans throughout the New World died at unprecedented, catastrophic, apocalyptic levels, victims of invisible assailants they neither understood nor were evolutionarily prepared to combat. In the worst versions of the narrative, immunological naïveté is folded into the larger metaphor of Native Americans as inexperienced, genetically weaker, and helpless to defend themselves against the oncoming tide of colonialism. Disease, a scythe cutting a path ahead of colonial encounters, conveniently explains the absence of Native Americans from the narrative of post-contact history and obscures the history of rebellion, revolt, conflict, peace and negotiation that followed on the heels of colonial encounters. \n\n**The Reality: A Toxic Cocktail Poured Out Over Centuries**\n\nPrevious myths of conquest posts highlighted the persistence of dynamic Native American communities who allied with Cortés against Tenochtitlan, defeated the majority of *entradas* into North America, served as translators throughout the New World, violently resisted conquest for centuries, and actively negotiated an autonomous existence in the mission system. With a firm foundation on this abundant evidence of life we now turn to the narrative of death. The reality of excess mortality after contact requires an examination the complete colonial cocktail leading to population decline, as well as the ecological factors that allowed for the initiation and propagation of epidemics. Demographic decline occurred due to a variety of factors striking over the course of centuries, not just by disease alone.  \n\n*Mexican Demographic Trends Inappropriately Generalized*\n\nThe 90-95% figure that dominates the popular discourse has its foundation in the study of mortality in conquest-period Mexico. Several terrible epidemics struck the population of greater Mexico (estimated at ~22 million at contact) in quick succession. Roughly 8 million died in the 1520 smallpox epidemic, followed closely by the 1545 and 1576 cocoliztli epidemics where ~12-15 million and ~2 million perished, respectively (Acuna-Soto et al., 2002). After these epidemics and other demographic insults, the population in Mexico hit its nadir (lowest point) by 1600 before slowly beginning to recover. \n\nThough the data from Mexico represents a great work of historic demography, the mortality figures from one specific place and time have been uncritically applied across the New World. Two key factors are commonly omitted when transferring the 90-95% mortality seen in Mexico to the greater Americas: (1) the 90-95% figure represents all excess mortality after contact (including the impact of warfare, famine, slavery, etc. with disease totals), and (2) disease mortality in Mexico was highest in densely populated urban centers where epidemics spread by rapidly among a population directly exposed to large numbers of Spanish colonists. Very few locations in the Americas mimic these ecological conditions, making the application of demographic patterns witnessed in one specific location inappropriate for generalization to the entire New World.\n\n*Interaction of Host, Pathogen, and Environment*\n\nAs hinted earlier, any examination of disease epidemiology after contact must incorporate a larger ecological perspective. Epidemics require the proper conditions for the host, the pathogen, and the environment to spread widely. Too often the narrative of “death by disease alone” fails to examine the greater context that facilitated the spread of epidemics. Infectious agents are treated as an inevitable miasma spreading ahead of contact. As [the case study on the U.S. Southeast](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bqvto/slavery_smallpox_and_virgins_the_us_southeast_as/) showed, the ecological context underscores how pathogens spread in conjunction with the repercussions of conquest. In the Florida missions, early disease outbreaks failed to travel beyond the immediate mission environs due to contested buffer zones between rival polities. Only after English slaving raids changed the social environment, erased these protective buffer zones, and destabilized the region did the first verifiable smallpox pandemic sweep the greater U.S. Southeast. \n\nWhen attacks by slavers disrupted normal life, hunting and harvesting outside the village defenses became deadly exercises. Nutritional stress led to famine as food stores were depleted and enemies burned growing crops. Displaced nations attempted to carve new territory inland, escalating violence as the shatterzone of English colonial enterprises spread across the region. The slave trade united the Southeast in a commercial enterprise involving the long-range travel of human hosts, crowded susceptible hosts into dense palisaded villages, and weakened host immunity through the stresses of societal upheaval, famine, and warfare (Kelton). All of these factors were needed to propagate a smallpox epidemic across the Southeast, and all of these factors led to increase mortality once the epidemic arrived. \n\nThe myth of catastrophic disease spread often cites an incredibly high case fatality rate (number of people infected who die of that disease) for introduced pathogens in the Americas. We hear that an infectious organism like smallpox, which historically has an overall [fatality rate of 30%](http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp), killed 95% of infected Native Americans. Taken without reference to the greater ecological situation, and assuming the validity of colonial mortality rates (a large assumption), the myth arises of an immunologically weaker Indian population unable to respond to novel pathogens. \n\nExamining the greater context reveals how the cocktail of colonial stressors often stacked the deck against host immune defense before epidemics arrived. Plains Winter Counts recount disease mortality consistently increased in the year following nutritional stress (Sundstrom), and this link was understood by European colonists who routinely burned growing crops and food stores when invading Native American lands, trusting disease and depopulation would soon follow (Calloway). Mortality increased in populations under nutritional stress, geographically displaced due to warfare and slaving raids, and adapting to the breakdown of traditional social support systems caused by excess conquest-period mortality. Context highlights why many Native Americans, [like modern refugee populations facing similar concurrent physiological stress](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dludden/RefugeePublicHealth.pdf), had a decreased capacity to respond to infection, and therefore higher mortality to periodic epidemics.\n\n*Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc*\n\nTraditionally, the discussion of epidemic disease after contact contains an element of a post hoc fallacy. Archaeologists uncover evidence of population dispersal in the protohistoric and assume disease led to the abandonment of the site. Historians read de Soto’s retelling of the Plague of Cofitachequi and assumed the population perished from introduced infectious disease. This assumption rests on the flawed notion that the New World was a disease-free paradise, that site abandonment can only be attributed to disease, and the belief that observed epidemics arose solely from introduced pathogens. \n\nA full discussion of the New World disease load before contact is beyond the scope of this post, but populations in the Americas were subject to a wide variety of intestinal parasites, Chagas, pinta, bejel, tick-borne pathogens like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, syphilis, TB, and zoonotic pathogens. Those infectious organisms didn’t stop infecting Native Americans after European arrival. Changes in host ecology associated with conquest could alter the transmission cycle of native infectious organisms, and transform a benign, or at least contained, infectious organism into one capable of causing massive mortality. [Researchers propose](http://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/revbio/bio-2002/bio024h.pdf) the devastating cocoliztli epidemics, which killed millions in 1545 and 1576 in Mexico, were the work of a native viral hemorrhagic pathogen similar to our modern Hantavirus rather than an introduced infection. The authors hypothesize that extended drought altered the interaction of the mouse host with human populations and, combined with other shocks of conquest, allowed for the virus to jump to humans. The story of cocoliztli encourages us to at least entertain that notion that epidemics after contact could occur from pathogens indigenous to the New World, and not solely from introduced infectious organisms.\n\n*Wrapping Up*\n\n&gt; One consequence of the dominance of “disease and acculturation models” of the postcontact period has been a lack of scholarly attention paid to the subjects of conflict, violence, and resistance between colonists and Native peoples through extended periods of time. (Wilcox, p. 17)\n\nThe “death by disease alone” myth ignores the myriad of factors influencing the demography of Native American populations after contact. Introduced infectious disease mortality was awful. However, I intentionally placed the disease myth later in the series, after discussing abundant evidence of persisting Native American communities, to place epidemics in the larger context of vibrant populations adapting, resisting, accommodating, and negotiating in the post-contact environment. Southeastern populations responded to the shocks of conquest by coalescing into powerful confederacies. Violent resistance to conquest continued throughout the Americas, and periodic waves of disease could not diminish the vitality of mission inhabitants across the northern border of New Spain. Epidemics were not an automatic cultural death sentence.\n\nHumans are demographically capable of rebounding from high mortality events, like epidemics, provided other sources of excess mortality are limited. In the mid-twentieth century when the Aché of Paraguay moved to the missions ~38% of the population died from respiratory diseases alone. However, the Aché rallied quickly and are now a growing population. The key factor for population survival after high mortality events is limiting other demographic shocks, like violent incursions from outsiders, providing sufficient food resources, and the territory needed for forage and hunt to supplement food intake.\n\nWhen the colonial cocktail arrived in full force demographic recovery became challenging. Warfare and slaving raids added to excess mortality, while simultaneously displacing populations from their stable food supply, and forcing refugees into crowded settlements where disease can spread among weakened hosts. Later reservations restricted access to foraged foods and exacerbated resource scarcity where disease could follow quickly on the heels of famine. The greater cocktail of colonial insults, not just the pathogens themselves, decreased population size and prevented rapid recovery during the conquest. \n\nBy far the greatest sin of the “death by disease alone” myth is the emphasis it places on a terminal narrative that contextualizes the story of Native Americans in terms of eventual defeat and disappearance. Disease provides the easy answer to Amerindian population decline, and discourages further investigation into the rich, abundant evidence of persisting native communities who continued to shape the history of the Americas.\n\nMore myths of conquest to come.

        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not here to shit on any religion; mainstream reddit does it well and often enough without me having to help them. But, I do believe that it's best not to muddle up religion with other disciplines that require hard facts, like history and science, for example. And while I do know that religious writings can provide a valuable glimpse into the history of a particular time period, believing that religious mythology actually happened is a perilously flawed assumption.  \n\nYou might expect more from Y. Sudershan Rao, as he's [the chairperson of the Indian Council for Historical Research and a former professor of History at Kakatiya University in Telengana.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellapragada_Sudershan_Rao) But, it turns out that he's not above indulging in badhistory, as revealed by [this interview.](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-11-17/news/56174738_1_ramayana-history-indian-council)  \n\nLet's get straight to the shitty history, shall we?\n&gt;**So does India, according to you, need a history or a past?**  \n&gt;History writing in India is just about 300 years old and is not exactly reflective of our past.\n\nAre you f\\*cking kidding me? Are you willing to shit upon the works of people like [Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak)(1551 – 12 August 1602) and [`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%60Abd_al-Qadir_Bada%27uni)(c. 1540 - 1615)\n&gt;The first generation of history writers in India was European, the second generation was nationalist and the third generation in the post-Independence era was dominated by Marxists, who use European tools of analysis. \n\nSo yeah, he hasn't even considered [Mughal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Historians_in_the_Mughal_Empire) and various other [Muslim historians in India.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Muslim_historians#India_and_Pakistan) And remember, he was a history professor, ffs.\n&gt;If Rama's story is not true then how has he survived in the collective memory for so long?\n\n1. [The Ramayana has a lot of variations.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana#Variant_versions) It's not even consistent enough to be regarded as true.\n2. You expect me to believe that stories full of [mythical flying vehicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana#Ramayana), [demonic beings of monstrous size](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbhakarna), [demi-gods with the form of vultures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatayu) and other mythical creations is true? Wut?\n\n&gt;People do not care whether Ram is historical or not.\n\nThen precisely why are you ranting about how \"true\" he is?\n&gt;He is truth for them.\n\nDo you even know what the word \"historical\" means?\n&gt;India's need is a special study of its past and the truth of its past cannot be denied.\n\nDidn't you just say that people don't care if a mythological figure is historical or not?\n&gt;We need to Indianise our history writing.\n\nI really don't know what he's talking about here.  \n&gt;**You say Ramayana and Mahabharata are \"truths\", but we have many versions of both in our country. So what is the real truth?**  \n&gt;[...]The content of one Ramayana may be different from the other but the existence of Ram, Sita and Ravan is consistent. That's the truth.\n\nHow is the existence of Ram, Sita and Ravan is consistent when the mythological variations about it are inconsistent? Hold on, I'll just examine the various different [versions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana#Variant_versions) of the Ramayana and see how they differ in their treatment of Ram, Sita and Ravan.\n&gt;Mappillapattu—a genre of song popular among the Muslims belonging to Kerala and Lakshadweep—has incorporated some episodes from the Ramayana into its songs. These songs, known as mappila ramayana, have been handed down from one generation to the next orally. In mappila ramayana, the story of the Ramayana has been changed into that of a sultan, and there are no major changes in the names of characters except for that of Rama which is `laman' in many places. The language and the imagery projected in the mappilapattu are in accordance with the social fabric of the earlier muslim community.\n\n#\n&gt;In Guru Granth Sahib, there is description of two types of Ramayana. One is spiritual Ramayana which is actual subject of Guru Granth Sahib, in which Ravan is ego, Seeta is budhi (intellect), Rama is inner soul and Laxman is mann (attention, mind).\n\n#\n&gt;According to Jain cosmology,every half time cycle has nine set's of Balarama, Vasudeva and prativasudeva. Rama, Lakshmana and Ravana are the eighth baladeva, vasudeva, and prativasudeva respectively.\n\n#\n&gt;Phra Lak Phra Lam is a Lao language version, whose title comes from Lakshmana and Rama. The story of Lakshmana and Rama is told as the previous life of the Buddha. In Hikayat Seri Rama of Malaysia, Dasharatha is the great-grandson of the Prophet Adam. Ravana receives boons from Allah instead of Brahma. In many Malay language versions, Lakshmana is given greater importance than Rama, whose character is considered somewhat weak.\n\nSo yeah, the existence of the aforementioned figures isn't consistent either.\n&gt;I might not know anything about my great great grandfather but I can't deny his existence for lack of evidence or how else would I be here? Similarly Rama's existence need not be proved by historical procedure. What benefit are you (historians) going to get if you deny the existence of Rama? Why do you want to try to prove he is not there?\n\nOhh crap...he's making zero sense now.\n&gt;**History writing in India has always been a Left Vs Right debate. Will you try to change it?**  \n&gt;ICHR is willing to debate all issues but historians participating should have a scientific temper.\n\nHow the f\\*ck is casting aside historicity indicative of a scientific temper? Ugh.\n&gt;Perhaps we didn't have any religion before Buddhism.\n\n[Nope. Don't even think of making that hypothesis.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_religion)\n&gt;**What about suggestions that modern medical science was there in ancient India. For instance, Lord Ganesha and plastic surgery?**  \n&gt;I don't think so. I think scientific concepts could have been there in ancient times but not actual examples of, say, plastic surgery.\n\n[Oh really?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery#History)\n&gt;Reconstructive surgery techniques were being carried out in India by 800 BC. Sushruta was a physician that made important contributions to the field of plastic and cataract surgery in 6th century BC.[...]British physicians traveled to India to see rhinoplasties being performed by native methods. Reports on Indian rhinoplasty performed by a Kumhar vaidya were published in the Gentleman's Magazine by 1794.  \n\nAnd so, I'm done. Thanks to /u/shannondoah for pointing out this badhistory on the IRC.  \n\nEDIT: Woohoo, it turns out that [Rao is a fraud, more or less.](https://archive.today/f0Cfc) (Thanks to /u/TortugaNeve2 for the link).  \n\nEDIT 2: Changed a few words.",

        "text": "[Here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/2u0lc7/how_english_has_changed_over_the_last_1000_years/) we see a post in /r/interestingasfuck showing the evolution of the English language over the last 1000 years. The [linked image](http://i.imgur.com/aE4v3Uz.jpg) is a page from a book using Psalm 23 to illustrate the changes. As an indication of language evolution, I think using four separate translations/adaptations of Scripture is not very useful. The psalm is being translated into English from Hebrew directly, or by way of earlier Greek or Latin translations, all of which were subject to the specific sensibilities of the translators (see: The Septuagint, The Vulgate, The KJV, etc). Since each translation is a distinct work, and not just a re-translation of the earlier English work, it's difficult to point to those translations as the evolution of the English language. \n\nAs we get to the comments, there's not a whole lot of badhistory, if only because the comments don't talk about much. One thing that does pop out to me, is [this nugget.](http://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/2u0lc7/how_english_has_changed_over_the_last_1000_years/co4b97b) The poster mentions the revitalization of Hebrew as Modern Hebrew, and claims that the language is \"ancient Hebrew with some funny pronunciations and about 70 years of additional evolution past whenever the most recent parts of the Hebrew bible were written\". That hits a bit close to home. Modern Hebrew is definitely not ancient Hebrew with funny pronunciations. \n\nModern Hebrew in its current form was developed primarily by a man named Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, who built his version of the language using classical Hebrew as his main source of the lexicon, as well as incorporating medieval literary Hebrew as well as modern literary Hebrew (which experienced a revival slightly prior to the spoken language). In addition, when he found no existing words for new concepts, he constructed his own words, along with the help of other pioneering Hebrew teachers and speakers. Primarily these were, like Ben-Yehuda, eastern European immigrants, lending the new language a Yiddish and Russian influence, as well as incorporating aspects from other North African and Middle Eastern populations already using Hebrew as a lingua franca with Jews that they shared no other common language with. With respect to the modern pronunciation of Hebrew, the \"standard\" is a Sephardic-influenced pronunciation. \n\n\nAnyway, that seems like enough of a tangent for now. TL;DR: Using separate translations of scripture is not a good way to show language evolution.",

Feel free to delete this or otherwise direct me if I am wrong on either count. Furthermore, I have a Bachelor's in Classics, so while I am familiar with the academic conventions of history and am quite knowledgeable in some arenas, this is a bit out of my sphere.\n\n[A user posted a parody of conspiracy theorist graphics in /r/funny about Hitler being a Nazi.](http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2tvxfo/the_conspiracy_is_getting_intense/) Surprising to absolutely no one, Israel quickly got drawn into the mix.\n\nAfter one user posts a similar parodic infographic about Israel being related Judaism, one user posts \"Is Israel a Jewish state??!\" in a clearly jocular manner. \n\nFirst and foremost, I'd like to acknowledge that I am well aware that Israel has no state religion. However, I doubt I am blowing anyone's mind when I state that [about three-quarters of the population is Jewish.](http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st02_01.pdf) Even though the government may be acting areligiously doesn't mean the people are. In further full disclosure, I am very sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and while I wouldn't call myself anti-Zionist or antisemitic by any means, I definitely think the US has backed Israel too much.\n\nOur brave hero /u/flipflow27 then enters the fray. He informs us, [\"No. It's a zionist terrorist occupation. Outside of of US and UK, israel is not recognized as a country/state. Someone sued Rand McNally because they found a map that only showed Palestine, sold in most countries around the world. Fun Fact: The only people to acknowledge \"the state of israel\" are US, UK, and israel, the only 3 standing members of the UN.\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2tvxfo/the_conspiracy_is_getting_intense/co32z2i) [sic everything]\n\nWell, that's a bold statement. I've never heard anything like it. I don't believe it, and not just because I went to the state Geography Bee 15 years ago (/r/humblebrag). Being a trained historian, the first thing I do is Google his statement. I get a Wikipedia article saying that [83% of the UN recognizes Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Israel). While this is Wikipedia, it is the only centralized resource I could find, and the footnotes source from official documents.\n\nWell, part one of /u/flipflow27's argument fell flat. What about the rest? This is the part where I reveal I'm a law student. Before I get into anything else, I'd like to say that you can sue anyone or anything for anything. It won't hold up as a suit, but the mere existence of a suit says nothing about its merits. Basically, even if there were a lawsuit having to do with Rand McNally and its maps, it wouldn't necessarily mean that there was a real reason to sue.\n\nI googled variations of \"Rand McNally,\" \"lawsuit,\" and \"Israel,\" as /u/flipflow27 was not helpful enough to provide links. I got nothing. I then remembered that I had access to Westlaw and LexisNexis, the two primary legal research search engines. Note that these are largely restricted to US law. I searched in both databases for Rand McNally. Most of the results in my initial scan were referencing their atlases rather than naming them as a party. I then searched within those results for \"Israel.\" I got 10 results in LexisNexis and 9 in Westlaw, 8 of which were duplicates, for a total of 11 results. None of them had to do with /u/flipflow27's scenario. Almost all had to do with someone or something named Israel with a reference to the atlas. One had to do with a vacation to Israel that Rand McNally had booked.\n\nI know it's impossible to prove a negative, but if the media and caselaw haven't picked up on something as monumental as Israel not being a valid state, it likely has no basis in fact. There certainly are no suits that reached the US Supreme Court. Even if it were a casual thing, one could compare to [Myanmar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma), which the US does not recognize as legitimate and instead recognizes Burma.\n\nThank you with bearing through my first /r/badhistory post. May it be my last.\n\n",
