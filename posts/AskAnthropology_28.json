So what are some good linguistic or cultural anthropology books suitable for a high school student?\n\nWhile I'm posting, I also have a question about studying anthropology in college. So I have applied to all of my colleges, and though some of them seem to have extensive anthropology faculties, they only have a general B.A. in anthropology. Would that be disadvantageous in any way for employment/graduate school, or is it something to not bother worrying about?\n\nThanks in advance!",

However, a contradiction arises, since even inanimate objects possess qi and, from my understanding, not in lesser or greater amount than animate beings, so that one could not say that by the decrease of qi below a certain threshold the cessation of vital functions is caused. Were a river filled up, would it lose its qi? What of the landscape that were to follow it? Would it be devoid of qi, because a pre-existing landscape at its location was destroyed? Would it possess its own qi? Likewise, if a person's qi is exhausted and the person dies, does the corpse have corpse-qi, being now an inanimate object like many other inanimate objects that possess qi? Or would it be devoid of qi? ",

Because of its history, the town is a Unesco heritage sight, and it has almost no industry whatsoever. 5 years ago, however, a factory came to town, which has caused quite a stir due to the smell it emits. This has severely affected the daily lives of the neighbours. However, the people in the other end of town, who can't smell anything, don't seem to believe their neighbours. Trust and distrust seem to be big themes in the controversy. I also suspect there to be an interesting connection between the non-tangible nature of scents and this distrust between the people of the town (it's much easier to communicate a loud noise, an ugly building etc. than a bad smell, and thus convince other people of your problem). \n\nMy question is, is there a canon of trust in anthropology? I've read A. Corsín Jiménez's article, but wasn't quite satisfied as it \"is not about trust itself but about the kind of theory that we need to resist the temptations of a sociology of trust.\" There's also a lot of work on the polisci and sociology of trust, but it only seems to be tangentially relevant to this project.

I know that whatever I do in life I would prefer to work with the dead. This is my dream job, I've never been so passionate about something in my entire life (I'm 23), but I'm worried that it's going to let me down.

I have straight A's but my advisor informed me that would not be enough to secure a spot and I'm freaking out a little.

Any advice you can offer me would be greatly appreciated and I appreciate anyone that takes the time to look at this! Thank you in advance!\n",

Therefore, I find myself struggling with both my personal reactions, and that of my family, to this most recent NYC terror attack which killed 8 people and injured 12. Of course, this is post-Vegas, which America has still not recovered from, so feelings are escalated. \n\nI was texting my mother today (my family are Trump supporters, except my mother), and we both found ourselves \"trying not to be prejudice against Middle Eastern men with beards.\" The amount of prejudice differs, yet we both feel some of those sentiments. Given that the Vegas shooter was a white old man, however, I know that his prejudice is exactly that: prejudice. Yet, I cannot tell my family to ignore the fact that there is a specific goal from a specific religion (which is dominant is specific regions) to destroy America and the west. That would be illogical, correct? To ignore a direct threat? \n\nOn top of that, the news was reporting that the NYC terror suspect in custody was most likely depressed due to family reports, which led to his radicalization. The family stated that he had a hard life financially and had a hard time finding stability, which drove hime to drastic measures. I explained this to my mother and she said \"every one has a hard life.\" However, this man came from Uzbekistan, of which I know little about but most likely revolves around fundamentally different economic, social, and political structures. The kind of identity clashes which would occur from enter a new fundamentally different culture structure could definitely dive someone to commit these acts of terror, yes? To me, this demonstrates a problem with conflicting economic and political structures, and the affect produced from these systems, rather than a conflict of religion. So when my mother asked if we should close our borders even more, something which I am opposed to, I had no logical explanation as to why not. The same goes for Trump's call for a merit based immigration system and the dismantling of chain immigration. Although I oppose it, I cannot form a rational explanation that would quell the worry my family and many Trump supporters feel, which of course Trump divisively utilizes. \n\nMy question to all of you, is: \n\nHow do we rationalize these issues of conflicting affect produced through clashes of fundamentally different economic and political realities? And how do we ensure that the family and friends we can speak to about this subject try to remain open minded and hopeful for a solution, other than to categorize all \"middle eastern men with beads,\" into this terrorist category, because we all know that that is illogical and foolish. \n\nSorry if this is not thoroughly explained. There's only so much time in a day. \n\nAppreciate any answers / advice. \n\nThanks: C. ",

The following link provides some info on this modification:\n\n&gt;The Ju/'hoansi of Southwestern Africa and the Aborigines of Australia usually respond physiologically to the cold in a different way.  Thick fat insulation develops around the vital organs of the chest and abdomen.   In addition, their skin cools due to vasoconstriction at night.  As a result, heat loss is reduced....This response would not be adaptive if the Ju/'hoansi and the Aborigines lived in consistently freezing environments because the concentration of body heat in their torsos would allow the loss of fingers, toes, and other appendages from frostbite....Their physiological adaptation is to environments that rarely stay below freezing long...\n\nhttps://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/adapt/adapt_2.htm\n\nIs the above modification individual or hereditable (or both)?   The below adaptation for the Inuits is heritable.\n\nhttps://anthropology.net/2017/01/01/the-genetics-of-inuit-cold-weather-adaptation/\n\nThe above adaptations seem to relate mostly to core temperatures.  (The link on the Ju/'hanse asserts no benefit in terms of frostbite resistance; perhaps there is debate on this.) Yagan people were probably regularly subject to cold sufficient to cause frostbite.  The strategies to ward off cold and frostbite cited in the Wikipedia link are important, but is there another evolutionary modification known to have benefited the Yagan and peoples like them (with only scant clothing)?\n\n\n",

Partially because of a long-time fascination with old stuff, particularly remnants of ancient cultures and the like, and even more so because of the level of personal freedom that the field seems to entail.\n\nMy first question is whether or not I'm wrong about that last part. The way the book makes it seem is that you're traveling around, jumping from cheap motel to cheap motel, doing field work out in nature for most of the year, and then you're unemployed and SOL the rest. I'm asking this specifically because I have a burning envy for Hunter S. Thompson's self-ruled and quasi-nomadic lifestyle that he maintained for most of his career, but I figure freelance journalism is a terrible plan A to have for most people including myself, and shovel bumming seems like a path to that goal that's less likely to result in homelessness - just thought I should specify to make \"personal freedom\" less ambiguous.\n\nSecond, what are the hours and pay like? Will saving up a cushion fund to last me until I can find work again, if I'm in an area with off seasons (which I've heard people say isn't the case *everywhere*) mean starving to death?",
