        "text": "Can I just mention that I'm thrilled when people get the history of food wrong? I love food history. It's the best.\n\nAnyway, in [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/33uakx/whats_a_common_misconception_about_a_historical/cqon3hv) thread in /r/history, there's a prolonged debate about who invented peanut butter, and how much it isn't George Washington Carver. The thread vacillates between Marcellus Gilmore Edson (the titular Canadian) and the Aztecs, but is unified in its opinion that it definitely wasn't George Washington Carver. I have bad news for them, though. They're all wrong. \n\nI don't blame them for their misconceptions. If you go to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter#History), it says it was the Aztecs. If you go to the source the Wikipedia page uses (a Huffington post article), it says it was the Aztecs. Everything is designed to mislead them into believing that it was the Aztecs. Or the Canadians. But definitely not George Washington Carver. The trouble is that the sources people rely on (like that bastion of academic integrity, the Huffington Post), are wrong as well. \n\nYou can trust me on this. I have too much time on my hands. \n\nPeanut butter is actually fantastically old. Remember when I talked about curry and said it was older than dirt? That's about how old peanut butter is in one form or another. Peanuts themselves are from the wetlands of Brazil, Bolivia, and Uruguay, and have been cultivated for the last seven thousand years. While \"cultivated\" doesn't mean \"made Jif out of it,\" by 1500 BCE, Andean peoples were decorating [pottery and jewelry](http://www.pca.com.au/images/story-of-peanuts-2.jpg) with images of peanuts and burying peanuts with their dead as a sacrifice. What's important for our purposes, though, is the fact that at roughly the same time in central Brazil, groups were mixing ground peanuts with maize to make a thick, pasty drink. \n\nThis, of course, raises the desperately important question of how we define peanut butter. By 1500 BCE, we see clear evidence of peanut butter pasty stuff. To me, that counts as an early form of peanut butter, just as valid as the stuff we get in jars today. \n\nBy the time Spanish conquistadors reached Mesoamerica, peanut butter had spread to the Aztecs. They roasted the peanuts before mashing them into a paste. While this is different from modern peanut butter methods - modern peanuts are roasted, blanched, and crushed, which is apparently a huge difference - it still produced a paste that at least superficially resembles modern peanut butter.\n\nHowever, if we're looking for the earliest thing that, if we ate it, would probably taste like what we expect peanut butter to taste like, we would need to look at west Africa in the 1500s. Like many other crops, peanuts were spread as part of the Columbian Exchange, flooding out across the world, and becoming an indelible part of a variety of cuisines. By the early 1500s, it was being mixed with honey and peppers in Africa into thick, pasty stuff much like what we currently have. Within half a century, peanuts had spread to India and southeast Asia, adapting to the cuisine and permanently altering it. \n\nInterestingly, peanuts weren't terribly popular in the US until the Civil War. Despite being previously viewed as livestock food and a poor man's substitute for cocoa, peanuts gained quite a bit of popularity with both northern and southern troops as a way for those troops to have a tasty source of protein. Troops on both sides brought peanuts home with them after the war, increasing their popularity.\n\nSo what role do Canadians actually play in the invention of peanut butter? In 1884, Marcellus Gilmore Edson became the first to patent a particular way of producing peanut paste. This method involved roasting peanuts, then grinding them into a pulp until it had roughly the same consistency as butter, then throwing some sugar in just for stability's sake. This is similar to the method used today, and represents the first patent of actual peanut butter. However, in the 1890s, two different inventors in the US - John Harvey Kellogg and George Bayle - patented two new ways to create peanut pastes, one involving boiling peanuts, and one changing the post-roasting process. By 1904, peanut butter was being introduced to the masses at the St. Louis World's Fair. The rest is, as they say, history.\n\nIt feels unfair, though, not to discuss the role the George Washington Carver actually played in the invention of peanut butter. While peanut butter was invented long before he did his nutty professor schtick, he was integral in popularising peanuts as a cash crop in the American south. Indeed, his work was not limited to peanuts, as he advocated for a variety of food crops to replace the soil's integrity after being drained by cotton, and as a way for farmers to feed themselves. He's most known for peanuts because of his many, many uses of the crop, but the man was recognised as a genius and a national asset in his own lifetime. He became one of the few black men to speak at a Congressional hearing, and was granted substantial extra time to speak because of how much he intrigued the listening Congressmen. While he didn't invent peanut butter, let's not disparage him for it - he still provided buckets of peanut recipes to the world.\n\nSources!\n\nEver wanted to know how peanut butter is made?

        "text": "[TIL \\(Today I learned\\) recently posted a Wikipedia article](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3g669d/til_the_concept_of_the_rap_battle_has_existed/) with the intention of claiming that ‘rap battles’ (from now on I’ll refer it to the US terminology of cyphers) go way back to the 5th century what was known as flyinting.  It’s such a dubious claim and quite offensive to hip hop (and other genres even ethnic communities) as a whole. There was certainly superficial similarities between Flyting and cyphers but the similarities end with superficialities.   \n\nTo state my own biases I’m just a person heavily interested in popular music history especially music that comes from the broad black diaspora tradition but my intention is to show that contextual clues is key when discussing history of culture not superficial similarities. I don’t think this is whitewashing for the most part (some comments are) but rather it comes from lazy thinking.\n\n\nLet’s start out by dissecting the differences between poetry and rapping. The two certainly overlap heavily but there is a distinct difference. Poetry is traditionally more based in literature whereas rapping can be seen as a vocal improvization. Another words rapping is key to music. There’s much more of a flow to rapping. It can be very rhythmic or melodic. Poetry does too but rapping puts a bigger emphasis as it can contract to the music.  On top of that rapping is descended from a bunch of sources. Jazz scat to reggae all of the influence is there.  There are certainly poetic influences for sure though and its blurs even more with slam poetry and the like. In the context of poetry hundreds and hundreds of years ago far removed from contemporary vernacular and culture the lines are certainly not blurry at all. \n\nClaiming that two things are connected because they have vaguely the same theme is extremely weak evidence.  You can’t say an orange was the first basketball just because they are both spherical and share almost the same color for example.  This is what the TIL post is trying to do.  \nThe comments in general are awful such as citing Catallus as an earlier example. While Catallus certainly did have a dirty mouth he has nothing to do with rapping for the reasons stated. \n\nI have no doubts that this myth will continue. I’ve been seeing variations of the myth for around eight years and it always disappoints me that there isn’t any type of rebuttal.  By my small explanation I hope I can make people analyze history a bit better!\n",

        "author": "Quouar",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3g6cmb/negotiations_deals_and_the_iran_hostage_crisis/",
        "text": "Let's talk about [this image](http://i.imgur.com/gqTGz4d.jpg) that, like so many, ended up in my Facebook feed. The \"he\" in the quote is ambiguous - I don't know whether it's Reagan or Khomeini not needing a deal to end the Iran Hostage Crisis - but to be honest, I don't care. It's still wrong. Negotiation and deal-making was absolutely vital to the resolution of the Iran Hostage Crisis. From the outset, both the Carter administration and the Iranian government worked to try and achieve a diplomatic solution (also known as a \"deal\") to the crisis. Neither side spent 444 days futzing about, waiting for Reagan to get elected and save the day, however much a prevailing narrative that might be.\n\nOn the morning of 4 November, 1979, a few hundred members of the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line stormed the US embassy in Tehran in response to the US allowing the Shah into the US for medical treatment, as well as out of fear that the US would overthrow the new theocratic government. Initially, their plan had been to make a statement and leave, but as more and more support for their protest materialised, the occupation grew more violent, and Khomeini's support for it more vocal. Carter appealed for the hostages' release on humanitarian grounds, but didn't offer an ultimatum. The Iranian government seethed with conflict as more moderate members of the government resigned amidst accusations of pro-American sentiment. The hostage crisis became a prime opportunity for the new Iranian government to solidify its power, as well as purge potentially problematic elements. \n\nUnderstandably, Carter started negotiating for the hostages' release, though these were delayed by Iranian and American internal politics. On the Iranian side, the hostages represented an opportunity to unfreeze Iranian assets that had been frozen in the US, demonstrate the legitimacy of the new government, and provide leverage for the Shah's extradition. However, the hostage taking was not universally popular - President Abolhassan Bani Sadr, for instance, criticised some aspects of the crisis, though backtracked as purges continued in the Iranian government. For Carter, the crisis demonstrated a failure in his already heavily-criticised foreign policy, and a further blow to his chances of re-election. However, in January 1980, negotiations began between the US and Iran's foreign minister, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh. By late February, a deal had almost been reached before Iranian politics once again intervened, and Ghotbzadeh and Bani Sadr had to back off. \n\nThis is the basic pattern of the Iran Hostage Crisis negotiations. Carter would reach out and ask \"can we be friends,\" and the more moderate members - like Bani Sadr and Ghotbzadeh - would say \"oh thank god, yes please.\" Iran would make a demand, Carter would acquiesce, Iran would make another demand, Carter would acquiesce again, and the whole dance would continue until Khomeini realised there were still political benefits to keeping the hostages, causing all negotiations to be scrapped. The hostage crisis helped Khomeini's popularity soar - particularly after the spectacular failure of Operation Eagle Claw - even while the Iran-Iraq War made ticking off a major world power a more and more dangerous proposition. \n\nIn September of 1980, the Iranian government reached out to the US, seeking an end to the hostage crisis. With the Iranian economy in turmoil due to the war with Iraq and sanctions that had been imposed and with no clear further benefit to having hostages, their goal became to get an end to the crisis. By November, they laid out their conditions for releasing the hostages, and on 19 January, 1981, the US and Iran agreed to the [Algiers Accords](http://www.parstimes.com/history/algiers_accords.pdf), which laid out basically the same things Iran had wanted the whole time - unfreezing of Iranian assets, ending lawsuits against Iran, and a promise that the US wouldn't interfere in Iranian affairs. The US government agreed, and on 20 January 1981, twenty minutes after Reagan took office (not fifteen like the image claims), the hostages were released. \n\nThe US, in essence, made a deal with Iran for the release of the hostages. It wasn't Reagan making the deal, true, but to claim that the Iran Hostage Crisis ended because of Reagan giving them a dirty look rather than negotiation is a gross, gross misunderstanding of what happened. Quite simply, while there was a political use for the hostages, they got to stay in Tehran. When they were no longer useful, they were released in accordance with a deal with the US. \n\nOf course, the question of why it took so long has always been there. During the 1980 presidential election, there were substantial fears on the part of the Republican Party that Carter would pull off an October Surprise and free the hostages before the election, potentially turning it in his favour. There are several theories on why this didn't happen, especially given how willing the Iranian government was to negotiate in September. First, there's the fact that Iran refused to speak with Americans directly, demanding that Algeria act as a go-between (hence the Algiers Accords). This slowed down the negotiation process substantially, and delayed its resolution until well after the election. Some have theorised that this was done because the Iranian government was mad that the Shah hadn't been extradited in the first place, and that they intentionally slowed it down. Delays in transferring assets, too, slowed down the process. Bureaucracy and the Iranian government's desire to stick it to Carter delayed the release and in doing, made it look like Reagan was getting the credit. He wasn't. Reagan probably had nothing to do with it. \n\nIn essence, then, while Reagan probably wasn't making secret deals with the Iranian government, it's extremely misleading to say that deals and negotiation had nothing to do with ending the Iran hostage crisis. The end of the crisis was wholly due to political manoeuvrings and negotiation with the Iranian government. Reagan just wasn't that scary. \n\nSources!\n\nThe [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/carter-hostage-crisis/) website has a good timeline of the crisis, which I used rather a lot. \n\n[This](http://countrystudies.us/iran/25.htm) is a good overview of Bani Sadr's presidency, and the problems he faced, as well as the political turmoil in Iran at the time. \n\nI also spent a bit of time reading about the [October Surprise conspiracy theory](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/books/the-case-for-a-conspiracy.html), which is one of those things that's just so much fun that I kind of wish it was real. It's like the theory that Russians stole MH370 - very, very likely to be untrue, but wouldn't the world be more fun if it was? Though, just to be clear, I don't think this is a thing. Nor do I think Russians stole MH370. It just amuses me, like cat videos or writing these damn posts.",

Due to the impact our decisions would have on the sub, we've decided to start a community discussion so we can do a better job of putting everyone's thoughts into consideration when making our decisions regarding the rules. \n\nToday, we have two points of discussion: the circlejerk and the overall atmosphere of the subreddit, and the possible amending of Rules 2, 4, and 5. \n\nBut, before we begin, we'd like to make the following announcement:\n\n#### **Staring today, the following unwritten precedents will be codified:**\n\n1. No asking if x is bad history\n2. No talking about how user xyz or sub abc is such and such (Rule 4) \n3. No bad history posts about comments or submissions in badhistory\n\nWith that said, let's begin!\n\n#### **The Circlejerk** \n\nWhen our esteemed founder /u/Kai_Daigoji first created this subreddit, /r/BadHistory was nothing more but a circlejerk meant to mock people for saying historically fallacious things or to make fun of popular bad history tropes. However, as our little subreddit grew, more and more people wanted to see less circlejerk and more actual discussion about bad history. To meet this demand, we created an optional Rule 5 to improve the sub's quality. This Rule 5 had to be posted within an hour of the post being made, and it could either be done by the poster themselves or another user. However, this proved not to be enough to satisfythe part of our userbase who wanted better quality posts. As such, we made the sub self post only, hoping to remedy the problem. Eventually, Rule 5 became required and the OP themselves became responsibe for providing Rule 5. Finally, come the dawn of the moratorium, the circlejerk was decreased even more.\n\nHowever, despite our efforts, we've found that even though the circlejerk has become less, there can still be a lot of unnecessary snarkiness and jerking in the subreddit regardless of the content of the post in question. Seeing how many people in the community dislike the persistent circlejerk according to our 40k user census, we're wondering what you guys think we should do about this problem. \n\nBut, along with that, we come to a very important question: How can we lessen the circlejerk without turning into too serious a subreddit like /r/AskHistorians? *Do* we want to turn into a serious subreddit like /r/AskHistorians? Alternatively, how can we lessen the circlejerk without becoming too serious a subreddit and losing what makes /r/BadHistory /r/BadHistory? Is it even possible?\n\n#### **Rule Amendments** \n\nSomewhat connected to the problem of the circlejerk is the problem of needless hostility Rule 4 breaking, Rule 2 breaking, and the occasional low effort or bad Rule 5. Now, a lot of you are regulars, so you're very well acquainted with the rules. The problem is, *because* a lot of you are regulars and are well acquainted with the the rules, you know how to say things that are close to breaking the rules but not *quite* because of some minor technicality. This means we can't remove your posts/comments and drama ensues (wow, that sounds *way* too much like I'm saying we wish we could remove more posts or something the way I wrote it). And drama sucks.\n\nSo, we're asking how you guys would feel about strengthening Rules 2, 4, and 5 in order to minimize the jerk, drama, and the potential for rule breaking.\n\nSome suggestions your mods have come up with are:\n\n* Being more strict about Rules 2, 4, and 5\nReminding submitters to stick to history when doing their R5, while making sure to minimize or exclude any mention of politics (whether it be politics in general or something in regards to the political views or agenda of the OP)\n* Being certain that submitters aren't attacking or insulting the OP of the bad history in question to minimize hostility and circlejerking in the comments\n* Finding a way to disincentivise jerking and incentivise content engagement\n* Purposely change how we make posts and comments in a \"lead by example\" sort of way to limit the amount of circlejerking, hostility, and snarkiness in the comments\n* Have more closely monitored and moderated debates and discussions without actually shutting those debates and discussions down\n * Somewhat related to that: get more mods to help help keep track of everything and to make sure that the discussions and debates remain friendly (man, we're *really* starting to sound like censorship Nazis, aren't we?)\n* \"Incentivize high quality posts somehow.

        "text": "Once again, Cracked gives us some shit history, because *of course they do*.  It's in an article about [5 myths of war](http://www.cracked.com/article_22750_5-stupid-war-myths-everyone-believes-thanks-to-movies_p2.html), which does have some non-terrible history in it.  However, #2 is suspect at best.\n\n&gt;After WWII, the U.S. military did studies on how many men would shoot at the enemy on their own accord. The results showed that only about 15 to 20 percent of men would voluntarily fire upon the enemy. The rest just would not fire unless an officer was present and specifically ordering them to do so.\n\nWell, this is actually suspect, to put it mildly.  It's based almost entirely off of SLA Marshall's interviews, which, um...don't actually give numbers of this.  Anywhere.  There's no actual documentation on this, at all.  Saying it's \"made up\" would be accurate.\n\nThen it goes on a bit:\n\n&gt;That's probably how it was for most of history -- most people just stayed out of it. It has changed recently, thanks to professional armies (that is, people who actually want to be there as opposed to conscripts or draftees) and conditioning techniques specifically designed to dehumanize the enemy and make killing easier.\n\nWell, this is pretty fucking dumb.  Professional armies, or at least professional *soldiers* have been around since...well, a long damn time.  The majority of a force on a field might not be professional, but they certainly were almost always led by a strong core of professionals, or they lost to someone who *did*.  \n\n&gt;But even this doesn't mean they were actually trying to hit the target.\n\nThis goes to Grossman's work, which is dependent on SLA Marshall's work, which I have already mentioned is not exactly rigorous or really defensible.  \n\n&gt;Yeah, it turns out U.S. troops fired 52,000 rounds for every single human they hit during the Vietnam War.\n\nWell, yes.  Suppressive fire is a thing.  You're trying to hit the guy, or at least where the guy has to be to hit *you*.  You know, so your supporting arms can come in and pound him to dirt.  If he's too busy keeping his head behind that log because of those thousands of rounds heading his way, then he can't shoot you, and he can't move to flank you or to get into a position to call for his own fire.\n\n&gt; It's almost like there was a connection between this and that thing we just told you about most battles having surprisingly small fatality rates, and how full-on bayonet charges barely managed to kill anyone.\n\nOh, right this.  I forgot about the bit about \"bayonets being shit\" that they bandied about.  Well, *some* battles did have small fatality rates *in certain areas*, because the losing side was able to retreat in good order without being harassed by cavalry the whole way back to safety.  Also, bayonets charges were there to *break* the enemy, not to kill them.  But, really, I work third shift, it's 11 AM, I should be in bed, so I'm gonna leave that pile of turds for later or for someone else.",

        "text": "I love /r/MapPorn. It's almost as good a source as /r/TodayILearned for bad history. Like [this map](https://i.imgur.com/MwvMhJk.jpg), which was posted in [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/3fyj8g/a_map_where_europe_never_discovered_america/) this morning. While I suppose it's technically bad alternate history, it's still bad history for its misunderstanding of where Native American groups lived, *when* Native American groups lived, and - most importantly for purposes of this post - how stagnant nation states and Native Americans are. \n\nAs far as the bad history in the map itself, /u/CognitioCupitor offers a great comment listing the many different ways in which the map is wrong [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/3fyj8g/a_map_where_europe_never_discovered_america/ctt7s3w). To ~~steal~~ quote liberally from it, its problems include:\n\n- The Olmecs having disappeared around 400 BCE, raising the interesting question of what they're doing in Mexico in 2015.\n\n- The Anasazi also having disappeared long before 1492, once again raising the question of how they made such a remarkable come-back.\n\n- The Cheyenne, Chickasaw, and Crow only being in the west because of expansion by settlers and displacement\n\n- A host of location problems for most of the groups, as well as a misunderstanding of the factors that allowed them to rise to power in the first place (i.e. Comanche needing horses, which only happened because of the arrival of Europeans)\n\nEssentially, there's a lot wrong with the map. What I think must absolutely be kept in mind, though, is how Native American history was never a static thing. Much like how [this map](https://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/latemiddleages/maps/1500b.jpg) of Europe in 1500 can't really be used to determine what modern Europe would look like because of the shifting political landscape of the continent, we can't look what existed in 1492 (...or nearly a millennium before that, if you want to be weird about it) as a gauge of what could have existed in 2015. \n\nJust as an example of this, let's take the history of the Iroquois League prior to European contact, how it developed, and how that shows how Native American political history was hardly this stagnant, permanent entity. Based on oral tradition, the Iroquois League was most likely founded in 1451 (though there is debate about this date, with most scholars agreeing that it was probably somewhere between 1450 and 1600) through the political machinations and religious message of Great Peacemaker and Hiawatha, both of whom sought to unite the various warring groups in the area around the southern Great Lakes into a united confederacy for greater protection and economic prosperity. Each of the five groups - the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca - joined as pressure from the others mounted, with the Seneca being the last to join. With the League's united power, they were able to expand into larger and larger territories, displacing or subjugating smaller groups, like the Akansea and Mosopelea. They became the dominant force in the area, and an empire in pretty much every sense of the word. Their political power had a huge impact in shaping northeastern North America, and sent ripple effects throughout the Mississippi River delta as groups migrated away from the Iroquois. \n\nThese sort of events happened time and time again through the history of pre-Columbian America. Empires rose and fell, groups moved and vanished, and political entities shifted and altered. North and South America were as much political entities as anything in Europe, unlike what this map suggests. Really, this map seems to exist in that greater trend of assuming that anything outside Eurasia is history-less, or history that doesn't matter anyway. In truth, there's as much to know as with any other group of people, and it's just as interesting.",

        "text": "[This comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/39kmdi/the_disappearance_of_paula_jean_weldena_very_old/cs4lpgi) from /r/UnresolvedMysteries makes an interesting claim about women hiking during the 1940s, and one woman in particular. The comment says:\n\n&gt; Seriously, the thing I'm having the hardest time picturing is a young woman of that era being an avid hiker. I know that sounds sexist, and I'm a woman, but I can't imagine her routinely lacing up her New Balance hikers and going out for a multi-mile hike alone.\n\nWhile I'll agree that there is a perception that women weren't necessarily active in outdoors life, the reality is quite the opposite. Women have a long and illustrious tradition of being involved in hiking, conservation, exploration, and general outdoors activities. The late 1940s in particular was an era in which women's involvement in sports like rock climbing was exploding as the sports grew in popularity and accessibility. \n\nAs far as general outdoorsiness is concerned, there's a long and illustrious history of American women becoming enamoured with the environment around them. [This article](http://www.norwegianjournaloffriluftsliv.com/doc/212010.pdf), for instance, compiles numerous stories of women throughout the 19th and 20th centuries who could be considered to be as much at home in nature as Thoreau, Audubon, or Muir. The activities they participated in, too, are as adventurous, if not moreso, than many men. Georgie Clark White, for instance, became the first person to swim the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, and 1953 saw the first Western all-women's climb of Gyalgen Peak in Nepal. Even in the early 1940s, [surfing](http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/intersections/riding-waves-forging-communities-surfing-gender-and-feminism-in-twentieth-century-california.html) was beginning to be a gender-integrated activity, demonstrating the increased accessibility of outdoors activities for women. Before the 1940s, women were involved in botany, fossil collecting, archaeology, and numerous other outdoors activities. Indeed, the fact that the [Girl Scouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA#History) were founded in 1912 as a way for girls to get involved in the outdoors is indicative of how normalised women in the outdoors was. Nor were the Girl Scouts the only such organisation - outdoor camps for girls existed at least as early as 1907. Safe to say, then, that women were substantially more involved in outdoors activities than common perceptions might make it seem. \n\nHowever, the comment is about avid hiking, and how accessible that was. I'll admit that I don't quite know what qualifies as \"avid hiking,\" so I can't say how common that was. However, as images like [these](http://www.vintagedancer.com/vintage/vintage-hiking-camping-clothes/) demonstrate, there was definitely a market for camping clothes, and enough women interested in that market to sustain it. The women I've cited also likely counted as avid in their particular area, especially if they were climbing Himalayan peaks. Most importantly, however, is the particular case we're looking at. The woman the quote is referring to is [Paula Jean Welden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Jean_Welden), a college student at Bennington College in Vermont in 1946. Bennington College was an all-women's school specifically tailored to drive their students to do field work. In the case of Welden, that field work involved an increasing amount of botany research, and necessitated hiking and outdoors activities. Equally, Bennington had several active outdoors clubs for women to go hiking, skiing, and swimming, and saw encouraging women to participate in these clubs as part of its raison d'etre. Even if you don't accept that hiking and camping were normal activities for women in the 1940s, it was certainly part of the university culture at Bennington. \n\nUltimately, though, the point is that women were very much involved in outdoors activities of all sorts, from hiking to rock climbing to surfing. This involvement exploded in the 1940s as the sports themselves grew, and as the outdoors became more and more accessible. However, it's in no way unreasonable to say that a woman could have been an avid hiker in 1946. \n\nSources!\n\n[This essay](http://www.womenclimbing.com/climb/essay.html) is specifically about rock climbing rather than hiking, but still gives a good overview of the growth of the sport and women's involvement in it.\n\n[This article](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/03/sports/outdoors-women-s-club-still-thriving-in-massachusetts.html) is about women involved in hunting and fishing, and a particular club that started in 1940 - a bit tangential from what I wanted to talk about, but still interesting.\n\n[\"Women and Nature\"](https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_and_Nature.html?id=HM3-gBccFJUC) by Glenda Riley gives an exquisitely detailed look at women's involvement in the conservation movement, starting in the 19th century.\n\n[This essay](http://www.norwegianjournaloffriluftsliv.com/doc/212010.pdf) is mostly about the sociology of men and women's perspectives on nature, but still has a good history section that talks about some sports pioneers.\n\nI couldn't really figure out how to talk about her in the post, but [Bonnie Prudden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Prudden) is a fantastic example of women shaping our ideas of outdoorsmanship, fitness, and exercise.",

        "title": "\"Until the end of the 20th century, there never was a nation or a culture that recognized marriage between two people of the same sex\"",
        "author": "Quouar",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3fr26b/until_the_end_of_the_20th_century_there_never_was/",
        "text": "The title quote comes from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and can be found in the [oral arguments](http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-556q1_7l48.pdf) in the recent gay marriage case. While I meant to write about this case when it was more recent, it's not like Alito's bad history has ceased to be bad because of the Supreme Court's decision. Equally, Justice Roberts' statement that \"Every definition that I looked up, prior to about a dozen years ago, defined marriage as unity between a man and a woman as husband and wife\" is also no less wrong (unless he's talking about his ability to research things, in which case I can't say one way or the other whether or not he's actually able to look things up). Supreme Court justices aren't historians, nor are they necessarily knowledgeable about all things, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to take them to task for being wrong. \n\nOf course, the first thing that needs to be considered is what a \"marriage\" is. Like most things in history - or, let's be real, human society - the definition of \"marriage\" is incredibly fluid and reflects the particular society it's in, if it exists in a society at all. For the purposes of this post, though, I'm going to first look at things that are legally recognised and specifically ordained by the laws of their particular society as \"marriages\" - or at least the equivalent of marriage in that society, considering that not everyone has the same concept - and then at things that aren't *legally* marriage, but were *socially* marriage. Alito and Roberts would probably be more interested in the first definition. Me, I'm an inclusive kind of gal, so I'll look at both of them.\n\nPlus, I didn't do all that reading for nothing. I will inflict it on you whether you like it or not. \n\nAs I said, one problem with the statement that there has never been same-sex marriage is with that concept of \"marriage.\" Across societies and history, there are different types of relationships with varying degrees of binding or non-bindingness. We also have the problem of \"same-sex.\" Sex is another one of those things that isn't going to have a clear definition. Not to blend the definitions of \"sex\" and \"gender,\" but when looking at a concept like [*two-spirit*](https://books.google.ca/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=berdache&amp;f=false), it becomes abundantly clear that the concept of a gneder or sexual binary is not a universal one. With *two-spirit,* for instance, intersex is a class all its own, with individuals clearly being and identifying as neither male nor female. In a case like that, how does one figure out what is a \"same-sex marriage\" and what is not? Who is same-sex? What is marriage?\n\nBasically, people are complicated. Silly people, not agreeing that marriage and sex will have the same definitions in perpetuity.\n\nTo get around this, I'm going to say that if people recognise themselves as being part of the same social group that their particular society recognises as being an equivalent to sex (\"I'm a dude!\" \"No way, dude! I'm a dude too!\" \"Dude!\"), then they are the same sex. Kay.\n\nSo with these restrictions in place, let's have a look at the whole of human history. Can we find an example, of something that was recognised in its particular society not only as a marriage in the sense of a legal, committed relationship, but also involved two people of the same sex?\n\nThe answer is yes. So much yes.\n\n- Hittite law codes make [specific (if debated) mention of slaves being able to purchase male \"brides\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=hittite+homosexuality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MLICkbwUFk&amp;sig=q79ePjYWAqo9V-OAEHiFHFwUPkA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwA2oVChMIz_aJ7NrjxgIVgtWACh2-0gl5#v=onepage&amp;q=hittite%20homosexuality&amp;f=false) who, while called \"brides,\" seem to have identified as \"male\" in every other way, making this look suspiciously like a same-sex marriage. Beyond that, while Hittite law doesn't say anything about free men having same-sex marriages, or indeed much about homosexuality at all beyond a prohibition on incestuous homosexual relations, it seems unlikely that slaves were permitted to have a certain kind of relationship that free men were not, especially given that the law seems to exist to specify that no one else has rights to a slave's rightfully purchased spouse. \n\n- Prior to British colonisation, [Azande warriors](https://books.google.com/books?id=xH2JAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=azande+boy+marriage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wh5O39vCBg&amp;sig=Vny1qSuiFHuKMqZ1IJswDHGht4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwDWoVChMIxuqT54TlxgIVhsyACh22jwSb#v=onepage&amp;q=azande%20boy%20marriage&amp;f=false) of Sudan would take boys to be their \"wives,\" paying a bride price for them and marrying them in the same ceremony that was used for marrying women. While on the surface, this looks the same as ancient Greek pederasty, the fact that there was a special ceremony and a bride-price that had to be paid which was identical to the women suggests that these marriages were, in fact, meant to be more akin to marriages. The marriages were recognised as such by their societies, and good son-in-laws were treated the same as if they'd married a daughter (except that, in addition to usual son-in-law treats, they'd get offered a daughter as another wife). Granted, the boy-husband would later go on to have his own boy-husband in a sort of circle of life, but I don't see that as delegitimising these \"marriages.\"\n\n- The [Nuer](http://sc2218.wikifoundry.com/page/The+Nuer+Tribe), also of Sudan and Ethiopia, are rather famous for being one of several groups who have a tradition of women marrying other women. With the Nuer, this is as a solution to the problem of barrenness or widowhood, though other groups will do it for financial reasons. In these sorts of marriages, the women both identify as women, though the barren woman will take the role of \"pater\" and be the head of household. All children born will be hers, and she treats the other woman like a man would treat his wife. Once again, it's in many ways identical to a heterosexual marriage, except that the wife is encouraged to sleep with other men.\n\n- In 17th century Chinese literature, we find reference to the fact that men in the Fujian province could get married. Li Yu's [\"Chronicle of Extraordinary Love\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=3rEJ9hpvwlcC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=jifang+and+ruiji&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ni_jOKsFgH&amp;sig=o4b8LevAGAPuuNYz_5h9t2zZ1lI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAmoVChMIj9fxt6_lxgIVC5ANCh2K2wvJ#v=onepage&amp;q=jifang%20and%20ruiji&amp;f=false), while a fictional story, still takes place in an area where there is evidence that male marriages did occur, with men paying bride-prices for other men, as they would for women, and going through the same ceremony they would for a woman. \"Chronicle of Extraordinary Love\" ostensibly documents some of the reaction to this, but is also evidence of how these marriages worked, and how they weren't different from different-sex marriages in the same society. Indeed, this isn't even the only example I can bring in from China. While it's stretching the rules of \"marriage\" a bit, the 3rd century scholars [Ruan Ji and Shan Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruan_Ji) were well-known for their committed relationship and devotion to one another.\n\nThese are just a few examples. I found many, many more, but excluded them for one reason or another. My point is, though, that not only are these two justices wrong about the historical prevalence of same-sex marriage, but they misunderstand that their idea of marriage itself is based on something radically Western and modern. For instance, we make jokes about \"Biblical marriage\" being defined as monogamy despite tons of Biblical marriages being anything but, but it's an illustration of how the idea of marriage is based on something that isn't terribly traditional.\n\nAs an example, until about the 12th century in Europe, homosexuality was far more tolerated than at any point afterwards. Flexibility with gender and gender roles was much more of an accepted thing up until that point. After that point, increased urbanisation meant that these relationships and flaunting of gender roles became more prominent - and therefore potentially more destabilising - and thus was cracked down on. More and more non-conformities were persecuted, not just sexual ones, as increasingly powerful nation-states began to view social stability as something that could be influenced. European history is a history filled with lovers who happened to be the same sex, and even marriages that were recognised as such by their particular societies. What we remember in our narrative of our history, though, is the narrative of persecution of deviance and that we are and always have been a society of heterosexuals. \n\nReally, if we want to get even more into where the idea of marriage that Justices Alito and Roberts seem to be espousing comes from, we should look at the fact, until the Civil War, [cohabitation in England](http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/830) and [America](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002115/) was incredibly common as a replacement for marriage, either because the costs for marriage were too great, because of social pressure against marrying, because divorce laws prevented remarrying, or because they just didn't like the idea of marriage. Indeed, consider for a moment that, legally, slaves in the South couldn't marry, putting the entire idea of the American marriage traditions in an interesting lens. \n\nThe idea of marriage that Alito and Roberts seem to be drawing from is from the 1950s image of the nuclear family of man, woman, and two and a half children. While I won't claim that history is a parade of non-heterosexual relationships, I do think it's clear that the conception of marriage as being a monogamous, heterosexual relationship is a recent one, and certainly not one that can be stretched back throughout the annals of time. I can understand where this idea comes from - when you're raised with a certain image being \"correct,\" there is, of course, going to be a backlash against ideas that are \"deviant\" - but wishes don't make it true.\n\nJustice Alito is wrong. Justice Roberts is wrong. Same-sex marriage was totally a thing, and marriage has absolutely been defined as being something other than one man-one woman. All you have to do is cursory research.\n\n**Addendum!**\n\nI wanted to include a bunch of stuff that I didn't include in the post itself because it didn't meet my definitions for one reason or another, but did meet other people's definitions because they weren't as strict. So more examples!\n\n- [The Tomb of the Two Manicurists](http://epistle.us/hbarticles/ancientegypt2.html), a tomb of two very intimate men from the 2400s BCE in Memphis, Egypt. \n\n- In 69 CE, Emperor Nero married a slave boy named [Sporus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporus).\n\n- Some scholars see Native American [*two-spirit*](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/11/two-spirit-people-north-america) marriages as examples of same-sex marriage because they involve someone who is biologically one sex or the other marrying someone of that same biological sex (sometimes). I don't think this counts because gender identity is not the same as biological sex and because the particular societies in which this occurred would not have viewed it as a \"same-sex\" relationship, but I'll throw it on this list anyway.\n\n- [Brotherhood rituals](http://www.livescience.com/7344-gay-civil-unions-sanctioned-medieval-europe.html) throughout early Christian Europe strongly resembled marriage rituals, and sometimes those participating in them lived as a couple afterwards in much the same way a heterosexual couple would. However, I don't know how socially accepted these were, other than that the brotherhood part was performed by a priest.\n\n- Conquistadors worte about having difficulties suppressing same sex relationships throughout the New World. Other evidence has shown a disagreement about when prejudices towards homosexuality arrived in the New World, but also that Spanish colonisers would sometimes have same-sex relationships - albeit not marriages - with Native Americans. \n\n- In 15th century Venice and 16th century Rome, there are [examples of men](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/23/-sp-secret-history-same-sex-marriage) being banished or executed for either co-habiting in a long-term relationship or \"marrying\" each other in ceremonies that were not recognised by the state. Likely, this was more wide-spread than just the examples I found.\n\n- In 1687, [Cornelia Gerritse van Breugel](http://www.historischmuseumhaarlem.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=402:cornelia-gerritse-van-breugel-1663-1688&amp;catid=31:others)(Dutch source, sorry) disguised herself as a man to marry her longtime lover, Elisabeth Boleijn, in a church in Amsterdam. They were eventually found out, and banished from the city. There are *tons* of examples of women disguising themselves as men in order to marry each other - this one just happens to be my favourite because it ended when Cornelia just got tired of dressing as a man and stopped doing it.

        "text": "School starts up for me in a week, and someone posted on our class's Facebook page wanting an intelligent discussion on the William Faulkner stories we had been assigned to read over the summer break.\n\nShe (a white girl) feels that Faulkner \"as a white man\" had \"no business\" writing all of that \"N word\" stuff in his stories. I (a black girl) feel that she took those writings *way* too seriously and saw of it more as observant than racist (even though I, too, was pretty livid when I was reading \"Red Leaves\"). Weren't all of these stories supposed to trigger us? They were supposed to evoke emotions of anger and sadness.\n\nAnyway, onto the two pieces of badhistory.\n\nThe first one: She said that he died \"before\" the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nBullshit! Faulkner died in 1962. The African-American Civil Rights Movement started around 1954 or 1955 (depending on whether you want to start it with either *Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas* or Rosa Parks).\n\nThe second one: She didn't like that I called Faulkner progressive (see \"Elly\" for interracial relationships and \"Divorce in Naples\" for implications of gay relationships) in his writings, so she accused him of protesting \"against black people going to white schools\" in the 1950's. I called shenanigans and asked for her sources. I have yet to find a source on this, and she has yet to show me her sources (she said that her phone \"deletes history automatically\").\n\nI did, however, find [a book](https://books.google.com/books?id=0nZ93-IKIeoC&amp;pg=PT307&amp;lpg=PT307&amp;dq=william+faulkner+integrating+schools&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hQIeivUvb8&amp;sig=uunh5HRa0UBnZAl-mNFgXvcdbko&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBGoVChMI6Nz-gsyOxwIVQ3Q-Ch1fsQ50#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20faulkner%20integrating%20schools&amp;f=false) where the author discusses how Faulkner tried to \"persuade\" Virginia to \"racial justice\" and let blacks be educated \"either by taking him into our white schools or giving [the Negro] white teachers in his own schools until we have taught the teachers of his own race to teach and train him in these hard and unpleasant habits.\" This was in 1958.\n\nIn the same book it is mentioned that Faulkner advised the Northerners and blacks to \"go slow\" when it came to integration to \"please\" the white Southerners.\n\nI found three college websites that all have a page focused on Faulkner. The [first one](https://books.google.com/books?id=0nZ93-IKIeoC&amp;pg=PT307&amp;lpg=PT307&amp;dq=william+faulkner+integrating+schools&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hQIeivUvb8&amp;sig=uunh5HRa0UBnZAl-mNFgXvcdbko&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBGoVChMI6Nz-gsyOxwIVQ3Q-Ch1fsQ50#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20faulkner%20integrating%20schools&amp;f=false) mentioning that he took a \"moderate, if not liberal\" stance on schools integrating. This same biography goes even further to state that Faulkner \"condemned\" segregation. Such statements drew in a plethora of threats from fellow southerners and even facing \"rejection\" from his own brother, John Faulkner.\n\nSure, Faulkner was quoted in 1956 by a London *Sunday Times* (on wanting a \"middle road\" for integration) as saying:\n\n&gt; But if it came to fighting I'd fight for Mississippi against the United States even if it meant going out into the street and shooting Negroes.\n\nHe would later explain that his comments were more of a [\"misconstruction than a misquotation\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=efc_r6Zw-08C&amp;pg=PA618&amp;lpg=PA618&amp;dq=fight+for+Mississippi+against+the+United+States,+even+if+it+meant+going+out+into+the+street+and+shooting+Negroes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0EqkcnX3NK&amp;sig=XGTSSIv2FB8ySvBvpSymjXvKDCU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIsdS-r-mOxwIVQYsNCh2nzwvd#v=onepage&amp;q=fight%20for%20Mississippi%20against%20the%20United%20States%2C%20even%20if%20it%20meant%20going%20out%20into%20the%20street%20and%20shooting%20Negroes&amp;f=false) since he was heavily drinking around that time of his interview.\n\nAlso in 1956, NAACP founder W.E.B. DuBois challenged Faulkner to a debate on integration in Mississippi. The [Ole Miss biography](http://www.olemiss.edu/mwp/dir/faulkner_william/) and [*William Faulkner and Southern History*](https://books.google.com/books?id=0nZ93-IKIeoC&amp;pg=PT307&amp;lpg=PT307&amp;dq=william+faulkner+integrating+schools&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hQIeivUvb8&amp;sig=uunh5HRa0UBnZAl-mNFgXvcdbko&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBGoVChMI6Nz-gsyOxwIVQ3Q-Ch1fsQ50#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20faulkner%20integrating%20schools&amp;f=false) both state that he declined the offer of a debate, the former quoting Faulkner as saying\n\n&gt; I do not believe there is a debatable point between us. We both agree in advance that the position you will take is right morally, legally, and ethically. If it is not evident to you that the position I take in asking for moderation and patience is right practically then we will both waste our breath in debate.\n\nand the latter does not have that quote but does explain that Faulkner believed the NAACP \"did not understand Mississippi and its blacks\" and therefore would not be able to help the situation.\n\nThe [second site](http://www.egs.edu/library/william-faulkner/biography/) I discovered does not say much about Faulkner and the civil rights movement. It's barely mentioned, really.\n\n&gt; His political interest involved acting in the Civil Rights movements. Faulkner was a supporter of nonviolent and moderate resistance.\n\nThe [third site](http://faulkner.lib.virginia.edu/page?id=essays&amp;section=faulkner) has a whole section dedicated to what Faulkner did in the (late) 1950's.\n\n&gt; ... he saw himself as a moderate who knew blacks could no longer be denied their rights as people and citizens but who also knew the white South would resist orders coming from “outlanders,” by which he meant the North.\n\nThis sounds like less of a protest about blacks being integrated and more of a call to Southerners to accept that history is changing (even though Faulkner is aware that white Southerners could very likely disregard whatever the Northerners have to say on integration).\n\nIn conclusion, William Faulkner was a white man who never publicly protested against school integration in the 1950's, which is contradictory to what my classmate claimed. Yes, he did make that statement about fighting for Mississippi while he was drunk, but even 4-5 years before his death he still vouched for \"moderate\" integration and wanted a peaceful solution for Northerners and Southerners in this conflict.\n\nLastly, it's best to actually research the authors of books (or short stories, in our case) you have to read over the summer before you spout badhistory like this girl did.\n\nEdit: a word",

        "text": "Your friendly ~~moderator~~ dictator team here. Just wanted to clarify/remind people of some Rules &amp; Regulations that need to be tightened up a bit. (What, you didn't think I meant Rest &amp; Relaxation did you?)\n\n**R1:**\n\nY'all are great about the not brigading part of this. All y'all kinda suck about the other part of this rule which is to please, please for the love of all that's holy, include a damn np link whenever you link to a reddit thread.\n\nYes, if it's archived we'll approve it, and if it's a link back to /r/badhistory we'll approve it, but each time a comment or thread is linked without the np in it we get mod mail from that tyrant Auto-Mod.\n\nIf you don't know how to do an np link it's pretty simple--just replace the www part of your link with np. So a link to the the results of August's moratorium would look like so [August moratorium](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3fel9z/august_moratorium_lost_causestates_rights/)\n\n**R2:**\n\nY'all are pretty good about this, so keep it up. The worst offenses tend to happen when we start discussing issues like Lost Causim, or various social issues through history, and then we tend to have lots of comments that go something like \"I just don't get Republicans/conservatives/libertarians . . . .\" Those are R2 violations.\n\n**R3:**\nI don't think we've had an R3 violation in months. Maybe not ever. Good job everyone!\n\n**R4:**\n\nAll y'all need lots of work with R4. Most of you are pretty damn good about not directly insulting each other. You're mostly pretty good about not using hateful speech, and those of you that do either 'fess up and apologize or we ban you. However there needs to be improvement in the following areas, because we've been seeing lots of issues with it:\n\n* Don't quote speech that's hateful. We generally won't approve it. Exceptions *might* include if it's in the text of a self post and you're quoting it to debunk it--but that's on an individual basis. If it's in a comment we'll almost never approve it. Don't use slurs at all. Not when quoting someone else, not ironically. Every time you use a slur we get notified by that tyrant Auto-Mod, and to be honest, we're terrified of AM (and its flunky /u/cordis_melum) and would rather not deal with it if we don't have to. \n\n* That bit in R2 I talked about how we tend to get comments going \"I don't get how such and such a group thinks?\" Don't do that either. Don't go around talking about how AnCaps are all stupid, and MRAs are all misogynistic. Your comment will likely get deleted as a violation of R4 because you're painting an entire group with a wide brush.\n\n* Don't make separate posts in /r/badhistory linking back to previous conversations that happened within /r/badhistory. If you've got an issue with the badhistory of a particular comment, reply to that comment. Don't make a separate post, as that can be seen as calling out the user, and is disrespectful and not civil. If you want to address a claim made in a comment, message the mods first. \n\n* Why is this an R4 violation? Consider this scenario. You and your best buddy are chatting about music, specifically Bruce Springsteen. You're having a grand old time discussing various albums, Bruce's various poor hairstyle decisions and whether or not Nils Lofgren or Steve van Zandt are the worst sidekicks. Then your buddy makes the horrible mistake of saying \"Bruce sure did a pretty damn good cover of the Patti Smith Group's [\"Because the Night\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xACZHv-sLCg) during the touring he did in '78, didn't he? My favorite is from [the first Passaic show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWos8TS9yaE), which is yours?\" Later that night you type a lengthy email about how stupid your friend was because he didn't know that \"Because the Night\" is a Springsteen original that he wrote during his management dispute with Mike Appel when he was prevented from recording any new music. So he wrote \"Because the Night\" and gave it away to the Patti Smith Group (and it was later on [covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUGC5oRpbkg) by the 10,000 Maniacs with Natalie Merchant). It's pretty easy to see why that sort of behavior would be somewhat uncivil and not very polite--not when you had the opportunity to correct him then &amp; there. \n\n**R5:**\n\nAll y'all are awesome with your R5s, and we really appreciate that. There's really only one minor thing about R5 that can be improved on, and that's the idea of posting shitty comments here and then debunking them. If we're talking about things like racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. the better sub for them is probably /r/BadSocialScience, because it's really hard to historically debunk things like that. If you're going to make a post about the racism, sexism, homophobia, or other general bigotry of a particular comment or post you'd better be prepared to A.) be *very* specific about what part of that post you're commenting on, and B.) limit yourself to the badhistory portion of it, because otherwise you end up too close to the line of violating R2 and R5. \n",

        "title": "1844 - A year in which Baha'i was not founded",
        "author": "Quouar",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3fny26/1844_a_year_in_which_bahai_was_not_founded/",
        "text": "I'd like to take a look at [this chart](http://rahoorkhuit93.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timeline-myth-religion.jpg). There's a lot wrong with this chart. Really, it's easier to pick out what's right about it rather than what's wrong, but that's beside the point. I'm going to ignore most of the chart and instead focus specifically on the bit of it that talks about \"Baha'ism\" and when it was founded. There's multiple problems with this one specific entry on the tree, but more importantly, it also sheds light on the difficulty of trying to assign one specific date to the founding of a religion. Religion is more complex than that. I swear I'll explain, though.\n\nFirst off, \"Baha'ism\" is not the name of the religion. \"Baha'ism\" is actually a rather insulting way to refer to the Baha'i faith, one which was historically popular, but which has been seen more recently as unacceptable. I'm also not clear on why it's listed as a semitic faith rather than an Iranian one - while it does come out of the Judeo-Christian tradition, it was founded in Iran and with Iranian interpretations of Shi'i Islam. I would say that my confidence in the chart has been shaken, but I think it's difficult to shake something that wasn't there to begin with. \n\nWhat's more interesting is the choice of year. Don't get me wrong - 1844 is an important year in the development of Baha'i. It's the year the Baha'i calendar starts, and it's the year of the Declaration of the Bab, but it's not the year Baha'i was founded. It's the year Babism was founded, and to understand the distinction and relationship of the two, we have to understand a bit about 19th century Iranian Islam. \n\nAli-Muhammad (who would later be called the Bab, and who I'm going to refer to as \"the Bab\" from here on out) grew up and was raised surrounded by Twelvers, or members of Shi'i Islam who hold the belief that the twelfth imam is hidden, but will reappear at the end of days as Al-Qa'im (or Mahdi, to use the more well-known, but slightly less accurate term), and will help lead the fight against evil. Understandably, there have been numerous people throughout history claiming to be the Mahdi, and each time, they have either had followers and gone on to be politically powerful (such as Muhammad Ahmad, leader of the Mahdists in Sudan, or Wallace Fard Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam), or have been taken out back and shot. There were also searches for these \"twelfth imams\" and travelling scholars and imams who would preach about them. Iran in 1844 was rife with these travelling scholars. One of them - Mulla Hussayn - traveled to the town of Shiraz on 22 May, 1844, where he encountered the Bab, your average 20-something 19th century Iranian Muslim, educated in the Qur'an, working as a merchant, and who had apparently been having prophetic dreams. The two had a chat, Hussayn tested the Bab, and determined that he was the Mahdi. This is known as the Declaration of the Bab in Baha'i. \n\nThe Declaration of the Bab is indeed very important in Baha'i. As I said earlier, 23 May 1844 is the starting day of the Baha'i calendar, and is one of the nine holy days in Baha'i. However, listing it as the founding of Baha'i misrepresents what happens next in the story of Baha'i.\n\nOnce the Bab was recognised at the Mahdi, he set to work establishing himself as a religious authority. He authored the *Qayyumu'l-asma*, a massive text meant to fulfil the same purpose as the Qur'an, namely to clarify God's wishes for the world. It also established the Bab as the most exalted, and solidified his place with regards to *dhikr,* or rememberance of God. Over the course of the forty days it took to write this, the Bab attracted eighteen followers who then became the first missionaries of the faith. In September 1844, the Bab left for Mecca while his followers tried to secretly convert Muslims throughout the Middle East, but in actuality largely succeeded in getting themselves killed as heretics. However, some did attract converts, enough so that by early 1845, the city of Karbala was in turmoil, and the Bab was arrested as a dissident on his way back to Shiraz. He was imprisoned, but the faith continued to grow until by 1850, there were major conflicts with Babis across Iran. To try and solve this, on 9 July, 1850, the Bab was executed in Tabriz, along with several other Babi leaders, and the persecution of practicing Babis.\n\nBabism essentially vanished; however, a few of its leaders escaped execution, the most notable of which was Mirza Husayn-al Nuri, who, in 1853, came to dominate the remaining Babis through his charisma and ability to keep them organised. During his imprisonment, al Nuri came to describe himself as a prophet in his own right and gave himself a new name - Baha'u'llah. Those who followed him began to follow his writings and interpretations of the Bab's writings over the Bab, at some point shifting from being followers of the Bab to followers of Baha'u'llah. Most of them shifted from calling themselves Babis to calling themselves Baha'is. \n\nI'll pause here for a moment, because this shift really illustrates the problem with the chart and with trying to establish any one particular date for the founding of a religion. Without the events in 1844, Baha'i as a faith would never have happened, but equally, Babism was not Baha'i. Indeed, after Baha'u'llah's declaration, there were still some Babis - like Subh-i-Azal - who didn't recognise Baha'u'llah's claim and who maintained that Baha'is were a heretical sect. This solidifies the idea that the founding of Babism is not the same thing as the founding of Baha'i, however interconnected the two faiths might be. Equally important, though, is Baha'u'llah's own declaration in 1863, without which there would be no Baha'is. However, just as the conflict with Subh-i-Azal demonstrates that the founding of Babism was not the founding of Baha'i, it also shows that Baha'u'llah's declaration of himself as a manifestation (prophet, to use the more understood, slightly less accurate term) was not in and of itself the founding of a faith because he had no followers, and be because he himself was unlikely to have seen himself as founding a new faith, but rather, fulfilling and clarifying and older one. \n\nTo put it more simply, what marks the start of a religion? Does saying \"boom, new religion\" count, or do you need followers? If someone doesn't say \"boom, new religion,\" but is later recognised to be the founder of a new religion, does it matter what they themselves thought they were doing? \n\nIn any case, by 1873, Baha'i was a religion. The publication of *Kitab-i-Aqdas* with laws specifically for Baha'is rather than Babis or Muslims makes it crystal clear what Baha'u'llah's perspective on the new faith was. A case could also be made that Baha'i was a clearly recognised faith by Baha'u'llah's exile to Constantinople in 1863 because of the Persian government's response to Baha'i leaders as the source of insurrection rather than Babis, but once again, that's an ambiguous case and one that I don't think necessarily establishes a clear distinction between Babis and Baha'is. But then again, does there need to be a clear distinction? I don't know.\n\nHowever, what is clear is that 1844 is not the founding date of Baha'i. It's the founding of a precursor faith and a very important year, but not the actual beginning of the Baha'i faith. What is the beginning? I suppose that all depends on how you want to define a faith's beginning, but to be honest, I don't have a specific date. It's somewhere between 1853 and 1873.\n\nSources!\n\n*An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith* by Peter Smith and really all of Peter Smith's works provide a great look into the history of Baha'i. I highly recommend them. \n\n*The Baha'i Faith: A Guide For The Perplexed* by Robert H. Stockman (and, once again, all of Stockman's works) is also a good look at some of the early history of Baha'i. Stockman is much more specialised at some of its later developments, though - and especially the work of 'Abdu'l-Baha - and I'd recommend him more for that than for early history. The book I read was pretty good, though.",

I don't know what the dictionary definition of 'jack shit' is, but according to this cited [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War) over 100,000 PLA soldiers died in the war, which at the least would show his armies did more than 'jack shit'. Also the PLA was using \"people's war\", or guerrilla tactics, so it's not exactly fair to directly compare the two army's contributions. \n\n&gt;Mao and his gang of mere tens of thousands of troops were holed up in the mountains and deserts of western China up until the Japanese surrendered Manchuria to the Soviets in 1945\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_People%27s_Liberation_Army#Second_Sino-Japanese_War\n\n\nAnd a statement with citations\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist-controlled_China_(1927%E2%80%9349)\n\n\nThe second Sino-Japanese war went on for a while, so the comment may be correct when referring to the earlier years, but by 1945 the PLA definitely was more than just a 'gang' of 'tens of thousands of troops'. \n\n&gt;Stalin gave it [Manchuria] to Mao, gaining more than 2 million troops and Japanese + Soviet military equipment in the process. All he ever did in the 20 years of \"liberation war\" was to be a pain in the ass to the KMT and being an opportunist.\n\n\nYowza. Well I don't know what this guy is smoking or where I can get some, but I'm pretty sure Stalin went out of his way to make sure the Chinese Communists *didn't* take Manchuria when Soviet forces withdrew. And the fact that the PLA would be able to seize Manchuria the moment the Soviets left, while the Nationalists needed weeks to secure the area kinda refutes the \"Communists were just a pest to the Nationalists and only a regional issue\" statement. Not to mention, if that was the case they wouldn't have been able to take control of all of China sans Taiwan. \n\n(Another cited Wikipedia articles backing that up. Also I'm just going to assume I don't need to point out Stalin and Mao's uneasy relationship, or the Sino-Soviet split)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Manchuria\n \n\n\nI don't exactly know how to counter the 2 million troops and Japanese + Soviet military equipment claims, because I don't really know where they even came from, or how Stalin gifting a region to Mao would magically give 2 million troops to the Communists. Maybe the soldiers in the Chinese Civil War were treated as resources tied to the provinces they occupied, and if a ~~player~~ leader resigned, those troops would go to their closest (ideological) ally, or something like that. I'm not exactly an expert on the game mechanics of war. \n\n\nThe next two paragraphs I don't really know enough about to speak on, I think there is some basis in fact in them but I haven't really read up on early Communist Chinese propaganda. Like I said at the beginning, I'm not a historian so I could be pretty wrong, feel free to ~~roast~~ educate me on the matter. ",

        "text": "I came across [this comic](https://thenib.com/great-moments-in-peaceful-protest-history-44bdadb44cf) a couple of weeks ago (...fine, I'll be honest - a couple months ago) when a friend posted it to Facebook as an illustration of why the Baltimore riots were justified. I'll head that particular discussion off at the pass by clinging to rule 2, but the comic itself makes it clear how it feels about rioting as a way to solve social and political problems. It tries to say that non-violent protest is hokey and dumb, and that all major problems have been solved through violence. Indeed, the comic argues, it's absurd to think of these problems being solved *without* violence or violent resistance. It specifically cites ending slavery in Haiti (a notoriously bloody affair), the French Revolution (also known for being a smash hit), the Stonewall Riots, and the American civil rights movement. There's lots to say about this, but I really want to make two points here. The first is that this comic is laughably unfunny (which may be the point, but I feel like it's not), and that its depiction of history and how social change happens is misleading, if not flat-out wrong. What's worse about it, though, is that it misrepresents that social change is a fluid thing. Change on a social and political level doesn't always look the same, nor does it occur via the same methods. The changes that happen now take place in a different way than changes that took place in the 18th century, and what worked in the 18th century shouldn't be assumed to be the same thing that works now. \n\nBut I'll get to that. I'll even do it without body slamming rule 2. :D\n\nLet's look at what this comic - scrolling down slightly tells me that the author's name is Matt Lubchansky, so I'll use his name from now on - has to say about history. As I said, its first bit is about the Haitian Revolution (which is listed first despite taking place after the French Revolution had already begun, raising the question of whether this is meant to be an artistic statement or if the author legitimately doesn't know when the Haitian Revolution and French Revolution took place). The Haitian Revolution *was* incredibly bloody, to the point where it terrified other slave-holding countries in the area, and arguably made slavery measurably worse for slaves in countries like the United States. Over the next decade, Haitian slaves led by Touissant l'Overture would take over more and more of Haiti - and eventually the entire island of Hispaniola - repelling a British invasion as they did so, and killing more than half of the whites living on the island. As I said, it was brutal, and, when people think of slaves ensuring their own freedom, it's likely things like this and other violent events and uprisings that they think of.\n\nThe thing is, though, that Lubchansky's point seems to be that this demonstrates that asking for a peaceful resolution to slavery is laughable, and that the only way abolition worked was through violence. That, however, is very much not the case, nor is Haiti - nor the US, for that matter, since that probably shapes this guy's image of the abolition of slavery as well - the norm for the abolition of slavery. For another example of what abolition could look like, we can turn to the British Empire.\n\nIn 1772, [*Somerset v. Stewart*](http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1772/57.pdf) established that slavery was illegal in England or Scotland, and sparked the British abolitionist movement. Over the next several decades, abolitionism would grow, leading to the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which banned the slave trade but not slavery throughout the British Empire, and was heavily enforced along the coast of West Africa. 1823 saw the founding of the Anti-Slavery Society, which later became the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (and Anti-Slavery International). Its members - especially William Wilberforce - used their influence to great effect to convince politicians to outlaw slavery throughout the Empire. The Anti-Slavery Society, however, was greatly helped by a slave revolt in Jamaica in 1831 known as the [Baptist War.](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/slavery/8p4.htm) Initially organised as a labour strike, British troops stationed in Jamaica crushed the rebellion. However, its message about slaves wanting emancipation - and, more specifically, the financial and political hazards of them not getting it - became abundantly clear. In 1833, Parliament passed the [Slavery Abolition Act of 1833](http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm), which abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, with the exception of territories held by the British East India Company. Granted, this act didn't lead to true emancipation - it required that slaves over the age of six work for another six years as unpaid \"apprentices\" before being free to do whatever they liked - but it was close to abolition, and it was achieved without serious violence. Rather, what helped make it happen was constant pressure from a mounting political faction and a particularly brutally crushed non-violent protest. \n\nI'll grant you, though, that this isn't necessarily an example of slaves themselves asking nicely for freedom and getting it - though I'd argue that the Baptist War certainly made a statement. It's an example of what well-placed social elites can do when they keep pressing for something. However, I don't want to give the impression either that black slaves were entirely without agency. Freed slaves played a large role in British abolition organisations, and their narratives helped demonstrate to the public why slavery needed to be abolished. In addition, things like the Baptist War made it clear from countries with an enslaved population that there was a desire from within that population for freedom, and that they were willing to take matters into their own hands. \n\nBut I feel like what Lubchansky is saying is that non-violent protest doesn't work, and I also worry that my examples might not demonstrate how much that's not true, so I'll add in another. Remember when I said that the Slavery Abolition Act made slaves remain essentially slaves for another six years after the Act passed? Shockingly, former slaves weren't terribly pleased with that. In Trinidad, protests began in July 1834 with resistance from abolitionists, and more earnestly in August as slaves began protesting in front of the governor's mansion, demanding immediate freedom and chanting that they would not tolerate another six years of slavery. These protests continued for four years, and led to an early end to the apprenticeship system, and to Trinidad being the first British colony to end slavery. Throughout, the protests remained non-violent, and relied on labour strikes and disruptions to Trinidad's economic structure. It's a clear demonstration of the fact that non-violent protests could solve a problem, even if it took a bit for that problem to be solved.\n\nIndeed, the fact that non-violent methods do generally take a while to work can be seen with multiple non-violent protests, especially women's suffrage. While it's hard to pinpoint when movements for women's suffrage began - women such as Olympe de Gouges were calling for women's suffrage during the French Revolution, for instance - what is clear is that, much like the abolition movement, it was a slow process of building up support for an idea, and then having it enacted. The first women's rights convention in the US, for example, was in 1840, and wouldn't see its goal of women's suffrage until 1920, eighty years later. However, throughout the movement, violence wasn't the method of choice. Indeed, when Alice Paul and Harriet Stanton Blatch initially proposed picketing and picketing the White House specifically to get more attention to their cause, the suggestion was initially seen as overly aggressive before it was adopted by the National Women's Party. Picketing represents about how violent suffragettes in the US got, though the stories of their suffering at the hands of police and angry mobs and the violence that entailed did attract significant attention to their cause. \n\nWhat's really key about this, though, is the time it took, and how it eventually achieved at least its primary goal through non-violence and protest. Civil disobedience without violence still achieved women's suffrage, even if it took a long time to get there. If anything, that particular fight is *still* going, and the overall goal of equality still hasn't been achieved. \n\nThat brings me to the last panel of the comic, and the idea that because racial tensions in the US haven't been solved, non-violent protest must be a failed system. Lubchansky makes fun of the idea that Martin Luther King Jr.'s focus on non-violence achieved anything, but completely misses the point about what made that non-violence work. Much like with some aspects of the women's suffrage movement, much of the non-violence of the civil rights movement highlighted the barbarity of the oppressive system when compared with the peaceful marches and sit-ins of the protesters. Non-violent protest in the civil rights movement was much more involved than chatting over a game of golf - it was an intricate campaign of altering public perception of what racial discrimination and segregation was, and calling upon a public conscience to elicit change. To say it was less effective because they didn't blow up a few trains along the way misses why non-violent protest worked at all - it worked because people are empathetic creatures and saw themselves in the suffering protesters. If you want to be blunt, the marketing worked, and segregation ended because of it. \n\nNow, does that mean there's racial equality? Of course not, nor would I expect there to be after such a short time. Equality is a harder thing to achieve once the methods of oppression become more subtle and it's harder for empathy to kick in. But I digress. This is about history, not about whatever I feel like chatting about, however much it may seem like it sometimes.\n\nWhen one looks at history, though, it turns out that there's a really interesting fact that this comic completely overlooks. In addition to the number of peaceful revolutions increasing relative to violent ones, those non-violent revolutions are substantially more effective than the violent ones, provided they meet certain conditions. Throughout decolonisation and the end of the Cold War (and certain events since that I can't talk about because of rule 2), non-violent protests have been the protest of choice with increasing frequency, and have been more successful. These take the form of social change, yes, but also the overthrow of entire governments, as illustrated by things like the Singing Revolution in Lithuania and other, similar non-violent revolutions. In these cases, not only did the public generally feel more involved with the revolution, but the non-violent aspect meant that state suppression was seen as even less justifiable, and led to greater participation. The state being resisted, as well, found itself with troops that were more reluctant to suppress the protesters and, indeed, were sometimes just joining the protests themselves.\n\nLubchansky's point is that non-violent protest is stupid, but that's ahistorical hogwash, and ignores the fact that *non-violent protest is more effective than violence.* It ignores the myriad of examples from around the world of protests that overthrew governments, stopped some aspects of genocides, or resulted in drastic social change. It's fine to have a point that you're advocating, but incredibly stupid to dress it up in strawmans and falsehoods, and then parade it around like a pig with lipstick. It's still a pig, and it will probably come back to bite you because pigs are jerks like that. \n\nAlso, he has no idea when the French Revolution took place. I've decided this.\n\nSources!\n\n[This](http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/formerly-enslaved-people-end-apprenticeship-practices-trinidad-1832-1838) is a good resource to read more about the strikes and protests in Trinidad and what methods the protesters use.\n\n[Here's](http://www.blackpast.org/gah/haitian-revolution-1791-1804) more about the Haitian Revolution.\n\nAnd [more](http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1772/57.pdf) about *Somerset v. Stewart*\n\nA [bit](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/slavery/8p4.htm) about the Baptist War from a site looking specifically at Scottish aspects of it.\n\n[Here's](http://www.loc.gov/collections/static/women-of-protest/images/tactics.pdf) a good resource about the women's suffrage movement and the particular methods the NWP used to achieve its goals, as well as the evolution of their protest methods.\n\nI recommend *Why Civil Resistance Works* by Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan, which talks about the trends in non-violent protests and the factors that determine whether or not they're ultimately successful. [This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/11/05/peaceful-protest-is-much-more-effective-than-violence-in-toppling-dictators/) and [this article](http://ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/facts-are-nonviolent-resistance-works) do a good job summarising the book, even though the second one gets a bit soapbox-y.

        "text": "This post has been prompted by a recent controversy regarding an Australian 'journalist' by the name of Andrew Bolt. Bolt has a history of denying white Australia's dark past, specifically he denies what is known as the \"Stolen Generations\", which is the modern name for a series of federal and state government policies towards Aboriginal Australians from the late 19th to mid 20th century (in fact it went on until the 1970s) which, among other things, included the forcible removal of Aboriginal children from their parents. Those children would then typically be put into Church run orphanages, where Aboriginal languages and characteristics were discouraged and English ones encouraged.\n\nThe specifics of Bolt's denialism ([found here](http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/stolen_generations_my_writers_festival_speech/)) are that: the number of children removed has been grossly exaggerated (Most reports put it the 10-100 thousand range, Bolt says a few thousand at most), and that the children who were removed were removed for humanitarian reasons which were independent of the ethnicity of the children and parents.\n\nLet me start with the first claim: establishing how many children were removed from their parents. Unfortunately, many government records have not survived, and even if they had that would only cover children who were officially removed. Nevertheless, numerous attempts have been made to estimate this number. Peter Read used NSW government records to count around 5,600 children removed by the government between 1883 and 1969, although he stressed that a large number of the records were incomplete, meaning the real number officially removed during that period in NSW is likely to be closer to 10,000. The number for Australia as a whole would be around 2-5x larger.\n\nOther studies have focused on self-reporting of removal from adult Aboriginal people. Numerous studies have found similar results: 20-30% of adult Aboriginal people reported that they were removed from their parents as a child. As the population of Aboriginal Australians between 70,000 to 100,000 during the period we are talking about, and policies of removal were in place for several generations, this estimate produces numbers towards the higher end of the previous estimate; anywhere from 30-100 thousand children.\n\nNow let's turn to the other claim: that children were removed for humanitarian reasons and not because they were Aboriginal. This is a significantly easier claim to refute than the previous one, which relied on rather uncertain estimates, because all we need to do is look at what the politicians in charge of this said. Here's William South, Chief Protector of the Aboriginal people in South Australia in the early 20th century, stating what was the bipartisan position for 100 years:\n\n&gt;I am of the opinion that the young children - especially the half castes - should be put in an industrial institution, educated up to a certain standard, and trained to useful trades and occupations, and then be apprenticed until they attain the age of 18 or 20 years. During this period they should not be allowed to mix with other Aborigines.\n\nIt's also important to note that despite contemporary politicians and bureaucrats claiming that the removals were to increase quality of life for the children, the *Bringing Them Home* report shows that [there was no significant difference in 20 year education or employment outcomes for the children who were removed.](http://i.imgur.com/H1A9K8w.png) Nor were there significant differences in other measures of quality of life, such as income, and in other areas such as mental health and self-assessed happiness, children who were removed from their parents performed significantly worse than non-removed children.\n\nLet me end by saying that, although this post has focused on denying the Stolen Generations, sadly this is not the only racist whitewashing of history that is prevalent within a conservative subsection of Australia. In particular the denial of the Tasmanian genocide comes to mind; however that deserves its own post and I'll leave it for someone else.\n\nImportant Reading\n\nhttps://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/content/pdf/social_justice/bringing_them_home_report.pdf\n\nhttp://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/34.pdf",

        "text": "Deutschland '83 is a fantastic spy show set in the early ~~90s~~ 80s in Germany, during the height of the cold war. We don't have an exact date on the time period of the show, however the first episode opens up with Reagan giving his \"greatest evil is not done\" speech\n\n&gt;It was C.S. Lewis who, in his unforgettable \"Screwtape Letters,\" wrote: \"The greatest evil is not done now in those sordid 'dens of crime' that Dickens loved to paint. It is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clear, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.\"\n\nThis speech was delivered on March 8, 1983. The show then shows the process of getting a young East German lieutenant ready to assume the place of an unlucky West German lieutenant and go undercover as an aide to a West German general.\n\nAt the end of episode three the young undercover agent is shown stealing a report that's kept on a floppy disk. The next episode shows the attempts of the East German intelligence agencies in deciphering this report.\n\nThere's a great [shot](http://i.imgur.com/N7ZY2lw.jpg) of a group of people staring at something in complete befuddlement. The head of the East German secret service (I'm never quite sure of his title) asks, rather grumpily, \"What the hell am I supposed to do with it?\"\n\nThe it, in question, being [this](http://i.imgur.com/9W1lpuN.png) 5 1/4\" floppy disk. \n\nHere we [have a scene](http://i.imgur.com/6gmJGtA.jpg) showing the computer \"tech\" trying to get information off the disk, only there's quite a bit wrong here. (Mostly nitpicky stuff, but hey that's what we're here for, no?)\n\nThe machine being used is a [Robitron 5120](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Robotron_A_5120_with_UDOS.jpg), which was first developed in 1982 and marketed towards businesses and institutions (mostly because of the cost). Notice the configuration of the disk drives on the Robitron 5120. They were all parallel to the ground, while the machine being used has all the disk drives being vertical to the ground. \n\nIn addition the scene shows the tech having problems fitting the 5 1/4\" floppy into the 8\" drives of the Robitron--but by 1983 the 5 1/4\" floppy was really old news (it was developed in the late 70s), and the Robitron had 5 1/4\" drives by 1983. It is possible that they were simply dealing with an obsolete model. \n\nThe tech tells his boss that he's got the wrong type of computer and that he needs an American one. What kind of computer? \n\n[An IBM 567 or 436](http://i.imgur.com/mObAqzX.jpg), both of which are made-up names. IBM didn't release it's first personal computer until the tail end of 1981. It was incredibly popular, and supply outsold demand, so it's possible that this report was written on an IBM, but the most popular word processing software by far in the early 80s was Wordstar, and Wordstar didn't port over to IBM machines until 1983--and it was a mess when it first ported over.\n\n[Kaypros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaypro#Kaypro_computers) and [Osbornes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_1) were both extremely popular personal computers of the early 80s (I grew up using a Kaypro II), and both would have been likely candidates for the report to have been written on, especially since they both used CP/M in their operating systems and Wordstar was still mostly a CP/M machine. \n\nOne other thing--the loading screen for the Robitron 5120 actually says \"Loader\", in English. I have a tough time believing that an East German company sold computers to East German businesses and institutions and had the instructions be in English.\n\nIf spy dramas are your thing, you should definitely check out Deutschland 83.

        "text": "Let's talk about St. Patrick, arguably the most famous Irish slave ever. He's an Irish hero, an indelible part of Irish national identity, and the subject of [this](http://www.conservapedia.com/St._Patrick) Conservapedia article. The interesting thing about this article and its partner [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick) is that the two make roughly the same points. Wikipedia just happens to be more thorough on the biographical details, and Conservapedia seems to treat legends as reality.\n\nTake the bit about:\n\n&gt; After six years of this, he experienced a profound spiritual awakening, escaped, and returned to his family but with the intention of returning to Ireland and converting it to Christianity.\n\nOn the one hand, there's some aspects of the truth shining through there. St. Patrick was a Roman-Briton living somewhere in Britain (no one can agree on where because, frankly, everyone wants to say a saint was born just down the road a bit). Both his father and grandfather were involved in the Church, with his father being a deacon and his grandfather being a priest. While Patrick wasn't a particularly good Christian (at least based on his own accounts), he was a Christian prior to being abducted by slavers at the age of sixteen. Indeed, throughout his captivity in Ireland, he describes himself as praying more and more devoutly until God tells him to leave Ireland, which he does.\n\nThe Conservapedia article makes it seem like he had a conversionary experience a la St. Paul. Was that the case? Probably not.\n\nThe Conservapedia article goes on to say:\n\n&gt; When Patrick was in his forties, he had a vivid dream that told him to return to Ireland.\n\nOnce again, there's some truth here. Patrick did indeed say he had a dream where he was told to go back to Ireland and convert them. However, once again through his own words, this was only a few years after he got back from Ireland. He was 16 when he was initially abducted, and escaped Ireland after six years, meaning he was around 22 when he returned to England. Unless \"a few years\" has changed its meaning to now be \"long enough to be almost the entire time I was alive prior to this,\" it seems more likely that he was no more than 30 when he had this dream, and certainly not in his forties. However, for the next thirty years, he would roam Ireland, converting people and establishing churches. I don't know if he was quite as successful as\n\n&gt; Patrick baptized 120,000 Irish and established 300 churches\n\npartly because I have no idea what the source for that was (though I suspect it's [this bit](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/patrick/confession.x.html) from his *Confession* where he says that he baptised \"many thousands,\" but doesn't put a specific number), but he was rather successful. Within two hundred years of his arrival, Ireland was Christian. \n\nNow, that's not to say that it was easy. Conservapedia is sort of right when it says:\n\n&gt; Patrick risked his life by returning to Ireland and attempting to convert the ruling Kings and Chieftains who ruled the island.\n\nthough, as usual, it misses the nuance of what St. Patrick actually did. It was indeed dangerous for St. Patrick to go back to Ireland, so he found a place within Ireland that was less dangerous, and starting by converting ordinary people. When the son of a local chieftain joined him, that gave him more legitimacy and protection, though he was still beaten, robbed, and generally mistreated by the Irish. It seems to have worked out in the end, though. Irish people seem to be big fans of his.\n\nThe interesting turn Conservapedia takes at this point is to start relying on legends to tell the rest of the story of St. Patrick. The article says things like:\n\n&gt; According to legend, he used the shamrock (seamróg), a small three-leafed plant that resembles a miniature clover to educate the Irish about the Trinity.\n\nand \n\n&gt; According to legend, Patrick banished the snakes from Ireland, as there are no snakes there to this day. \n\nwith no real evaluation of what those claims are or why they aren't accurate (because spoiler alert: St. Patrick did not drive the snakes out of Ireland). I'll grant you that the article isn't necessarily setting out to debunk every aspect of the St. Patrick mythos, but equally, it strikes me as rather irresponsible to purport to tell the history of St. Patrick without also going into the truth value of these legends. \n\nFor the record, St. Patrick almost certainly didn't use the shamrock to illustrate the Trinity. The first written record associating St. Patrick with the shamrock appears in 1726, and while it may be the most famous bit of iconography associated with the man, that doesn't make it old. Equally, he didn't drive the snakes out of Ireland - the Ice Age did. \n\nBut that brings me to what I think is one of the more fascinating aspects of this article, namely the bit about role St. Patrick has played in Irish identity.\n\n&gt; Catholics leaders also had to revise the traditional image of Patrick as a miracle-working, Moses-like prophet in order to remake him into the model of a devout pastor administering sacraments and encouraging repentance for sins. By the middle of the 17th century he was firmly established as the founder of Catholicism in Ireland. By 1800 Protestants in Ireland had also adopted him.\n\nThe first interesting bit is how the Conservapedia article itself seems to fall in line with the Catholic view of emphasising the aspects of St. Patrick that are Mosaic or miraculous over the historically accurate one. Considering how anti-Catholic the article on Catholicism is (go on, read it, you know you want to(and follow it up with [this one](http://www.conservapedia.com/Cafeteria_Catholic)), the fact that this article largely agrees with the Catholic approach just makes me laugh. \n\nBeyond that, though, the phrase \"Protestants in Ireland had also adopted him\" just makes no sense. That St. Patrick was the patron saint of Ireland and a key figure in Ireland's conversion was never in doubt, regardless of whether one was Catholic or Protestant. Indeed, St. Patrick and St. Patrick's Day is a bigger part of *American-Irish* identity than strictly Irish identity. I just don't know what to do with that sentence. \n\nBut as I said, what I find most interesting about the Conservapedia article - beyond its Catholic leanings, which are hilarious - is the fact that it gets the rough narrative right. It just really, really doesn't understand details, or the difference between myth and history, or what \"consequences\" are. It's wrong, but a very special, subtle kind of wrong.\n\nAlso, I missed you, /r/badhistory. I missed you very much.",

The Germans had been using it to great effect in battles prior to the war and continued to improve. The Germans were so successful with it against the French in the initial stages of the war that the other armies of Europe hastily clamoured to build their own through fear of being the next victims, with no obvious defense against such tactics. It was the A-Bomb of its era.\n\nDisregarding the last line (LMFAO) this is just flat out badhistory. As mentioned in the comments the French 7.5cm flat trajectory field gun was an astounding piece of technology that came into service in 1897. It would be capable of firing 3 rounds for every 1 the German counterpart, the 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A. The British had their equivalent, the QF 18 pounder or the BLC 15 pounder, which saw service since 1904 and 1907 respectively past the wars end. \n\nThe irony of him stating that the rest of Europe 'clamored' to catch up to German artillery advance should not be lost considering it was the German reaction to the French 75mm that caused them to rapidly modernize their artillery corps. Each Division in 1914 would have nine 4 gun batteries and twelve more 4 gun batteries as their own independent command adding up to 120 of these 75mm field guns and a daily output of 13 600 rounds produced per day for these guns. So something tells me, an itching feeling, that the armies of Europe, notably the French, knew what artillery was. \n\nThe reason, in short, the Germans were so successful against the French early in the war was because they had more heavy pieces; by that I mean the French had basically none. However by the time of the Marne they had lost all those pieces mostly due to not having the logistical ability to bring them up as fast as the armies were moving. The French kept all their highly mobile 75mm guns though and when the Marne happened the French had a 2:1 artillery advantage and whallopped the inferior German 77mm's. \n\nFor instance northeast of Nancy, during the Battle of Grand Couronné the Bavarian artillery could not even perform counter battery -- the French guns were so light and mobile that every time they sighted their positions the guns were already gone firing elsewhere. The German attack melted on the 10th as the rail-bound heavy guns could not support the infantry advance while the French 75's could join the infantry on the counter attack. By the next morning Luneville would be abandoned by German forces in panic and Fraimbois, Remereville, Nomeny, and Pont-a-Mousson would also be easily captured in the face of withering French fire superiority. \n\nSo, again, something tells me that *maybe* non-Germans had a clue of what artillery was and how to use it. \n\nI'm not even going to touch \"with no obvious defense\" against artillery.",

I don't know how he wants to measure vastness, but the population of the Americas is estimated to have been relatively close to that of Western Europe at the time:\n\n&gt; How close will scholars ever come to the real numbers? A recent effort by geographer William Denevan to reconcile the many conflicting estimates, by using the best findings of various scholars, concludes that 54 million people inhabited the Americas in 1492, including 3.8 million above the Rio Grande. [Source](http://www.bxscience.edu/ourpages/auto/2009/4/5/34767803/Pre-Columbian%20population.pdf)\n\nNative populations could be found across the entirety of the continent, and lived in large cities, one of which was the [sixth largest of its epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan). I wouldn't hazard a guess as to where the goalposts are going to be set for 'first world', especially given that the term is basically meaningless in a pre/early-modern context, but let's use medicine as an indicator of advancement:\n\n&gt; Medicine was not an unknown science in the Western Hemisphere. Most natural herbs used for medicinal purposes in the modern world had also been used by Native Americans before European contact. Archaeologists have learned that North American Indians made salt by evaporation and mined a great many minerals including copper, lead, and coal. [Source](http://www.ushistory.org/us/1.asp)\n\nI'm not saying medicine is the end-all-be-all determinant of 'first world' status, but it is clear that, in the case of disease, Native Americans had access to similar tools that Europeans had for combating illness. \n\nIndustry seems somewhat anachronistic to put in there, given that European industry only developed long after the colonization of the Americas, but the fact remains that Native Americans had [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy_in_pre-Columbian_America), [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era#Agricultural_development), and were engaged in productive activities which we can scarcely classify as \"nature preserve for the stone age.\" Yes, innovation occurs at different paces and in different directions; this hardly qualifies *an entire continent's worth* of cultures and peoples as cavemen.\n\nMilitary forces... there's a doozy. As soon as colonists started arriving, [natives had guns](http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2012/06/Riley.pdf). They were no fools, they adapted. Natives resisted occupation [well into the 20th Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars) and were often called into [critical alliances](http://firstpeoplesofcanada.com/fp_treaties/fp_treaties_earlyalliances.html) by European powers against their competitors. \n\nLegal systems really gets me steamed, because this is where so much of this 'native nations don't exist' bullshit comes from. There is a fundamental absence of clear understanding by settler descendants about the legal and political theory behind Native American governance. So much so that people often forget that [the oral Iroquois constitution influenced the American one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Law_of_Peace) \n\nAnd might I add, it takes a lot of chutzpah to want to die on the hill of legality when the legal scholar contracted by Charles V of Spain, Fransico de Vitoria, [flat out denied that conquest in the Americas was just war](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/De_Indis_De_Jure_Belli):\n\n&gt; On the opposite side we have the fact that the people in question were in peaceable possession of their goods, both publicly and privately. Therefore, unless the contrary is shown, they must be treated as owners and\nnot be disturbed in their possession unless cause be shown.\n\nSome more choice quotes that do not address the main bad history above.\n\n&gt; Whites built the United States, not Africans, not Mexicans, not Chinese, not Native Americans.\n\nImplying that non-whites have had a negligible effect on the economic development of the United States makes my head spin.\n\n&gt; Yes, I'm more than aware of the real threat of Papal domination from other white races... For example, Spain was conducting inquisitions against heresy when protestants were designing electricity in the Americas.\n\n[I've been waiting to use this one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjjS47z-65I)\n\nThose Catholics are so backwards, and yet we are at constant threat of being dominated by them in spite of our superiority! Also the implication that 19th Century America had much less superstition and far more science than 19th Century Catholic Europe is laughable. \n\n&gt;  I'm well adapted to standing by evidence when the popular dogma of my environment disparages it. \n\nAyy lmao",

        "author": "TemporaryCritic",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3f52k8/a_look_at_my_ap_us_history_textbook_the_american/",
        "text": "In the Fall of 2011, my sophomore year of High School, I received my APUSH textbook. This was a daunting time, seeing as though this was my first AP class and I had a schedule loaded with other difficult courses. At over 1000 pages across 42 chapters, it was probably one of the thickest and densest, and not to mention heaviest, textbooks I had yet seen. For a course that covers as much content as the entirety of US History in a single year (which according to the sometimes overly-patriotic authors stretches back to the dawn of time) one would hope for a textbook that is concise, clear and to the point. Unfortunately *The American Pageant* is anything but that, and its convoluted, purple, and sometimes downright inaccurate approach to forensically examining the minute details of the American past made learning the material a nightmare. It often feels that the authors (delusionally of course) fancied themselves to be some sort of historian versions of Charles Dickens, or Nathaniel Hawthorne, or John Steinbeck, or somebody, filling their historical account with unnecessary similes, metaphors, and other purple prose. Indeed, it sometimes feels like they forgot what they were doing and tried to write a sweeping epic of nineteenth century literature (and failed rather miserably) rather than a twenty-first century textbook. The title of the book seems to reflect the pageantry they aimed for in writing the book. \n\nWhen I received my textbook, I also received a pdf ebook file of a slightly older edition of the same book. Some of the pictures are different, but the vast majority of the text seems to be identical in the older edition. Last night I found it on my old laptop, transferred it over to my desktop, and began perusing some of the passages that stuck out most in my mind from my sophomore year. I would say I probably read about half of the chapters in the book that year, along with a few choice sections from other parts of the book. According to the curriculum and the teacher's syllabus, we were supposed to read every page, but I don't think anyone in their right mind could get through the whole thing. I doubt anyone in my class that year came even close to finishing the whole book (in fact I doubt many even attempted), except maybe that one crazy Chinese girl...\n\nAnyway, I digress. I have taken screenshots of the most interesting passages I found last night (and by interesting I mean inaccurate, confusing, or laughable), so I'll begin breaking down my finds.\n\n**Section I: Historical Inaccuracies and Other Confusing Blunders**\n\n[Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/WWqqlTQ.jpg)\n\nUpon reading this passage, 15-year-old me was surprised to see that Nathaniel Bowditch, a man born in the early 1700s, had lived to the ripe old age of 105. For years I believed this lie and occasionally thought of it. You can only imagine my disappointment when I decided to look up [the mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Bowditch) last night and discovered that he was actually born in 1773 and only lived to be 64.\n\n[Exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/wKrJuXc.jpg)\n\nAlright, maybe this one is pedantry, but [a Confederate officer's horse died there](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fort-sumter-cannons-mark-civil-war-anniversary/), so a life (albeit non-human) was in fact taken.\n\n[Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/LgkCtQd.jpg)\n\nThat's right, kids. There were not one, not two, not three, but NINE World Wars! But for some reason World Wars 8 and 9 were actually called World War I and World War II, while all the other ones had different names that didn't mention anything about the world. And apparently a war just has to have belligerents from multiple continents to be considered a World War. I always thought that World Wars I and II were unprecedented in their global scale and thus deserving of the titles, but apparently the barrier of entry for World War status has been significantly lowered over time.\n\nI'm sure there are a number of other inaccuracies throughout the book, but those are the only ones I caught at a glance. I don't recommend any sane human try to find them all.\n\n**Section II: Pompousness and Patriotism**\n\nThis book does not want you to forget that American history is important. Like really important. That's why the authors decided it was necessary to go all the way back to the beginning. All the way back to when the Native Americans crossed the land bridge into North America in prehistoric times, you ask, and [as the introductory page for the first section suggests](http://i.imgur.com/u99FfLb.jpg)? No, that is far too late. American history goes back much farther than that. In fact, [it goes all the way back to the formation of the Earth itself](http://i.imgur.com/LUPrKwe.jpg). Yes, that is actually how the book starts. And yes, they felt it was necessary to put the 1976 US Bicentennial on the same timeline as \"Recorded History Begins\" and \"Jesus born\". We then get [a nice lesson in geology](http://i.imgur.com/A5e6HCs.jpg), as the author stresses that North America's mountain ranges are \"truly American mountains\", born after America took on its own \"geological identity\", whatever that means.  I remember something like this being a one-line gag in a book my teacher read to us in Elementary School called *The Kid Who Became President*. It's funny to see people do stuff like this for real.\n\nThe book has lots of other over the top moments of patriotism and pompousness. I'll spare you some groans though, and move on to the next section shortly. On a serious note though, I do have to give credit to the book for not completely whitewashing history. It definitely makes a point of discussing and damning the evils of slavery and the KKK, among other things (at least as far as I remember, though apparently other people I stumbled across online have conflicting ideas about how it treated those issues).\n\n**Section III: Purple Prose, Dear God, the Purple Prose**\n\nAs I said earlier, the authors of this book seemed deluded into thinking they were writing a seminal literary work, and as a result, many passages come off like a work of High School English creative fiction. Not only are some of these attempts downright gross and embarrassing, they make trying to cover the material for a test an exercise in critical interpretation. [Take the last sentence of this passage, instance](http://i.imgur.com/V7lity5.jpg). They could have just made it easy and said \"The populist party rapidly became irrelevant due to the Gold Standard Act\". Wouldn't that have made studying and reviewing a breeze? But nope. They had to fabricate some weird metaphor about fish from a sea made of precious metal gasping for air on a beach made out of another precious metal. Because that's what we all felt we were missing in our textbooks. \n\n[Here are some other choice examples I found in my relatively brief jaunt through the book last night](http://imgur.com/a/uHePe). Some of them have only one or two one gag-inducing sentences, though I have included the surrounding paragraph(s) for context. This is by no means a comprehensive collection, and I'm sure I've only scratched the surface of the purple delights this book has to offer.\n\n**Section IV: Treatment of the Present Day**\n\nThe final chapter of the book makes a horribly awkward attempt at maintaining a historical tense while discussing current issues and events. It is very strange reading about the quirky things that happened way back in the good old early twenty-first century. [Here are some examples](http://imgur.com/a/sIBQf).\n\nI don't know how to explain it, but it just feels *wrong*. They talk about current social and economic issues as if they were problems of a distant past rather than the pressing issues of today and *the future*. It feels a hackened attempt to keep the book feeling relevant when it inevitably becomes outdated, but I think it would have a stronger and much less awkward impact if it switched over to the present tense when talking about current problems. It would make them seem more real and urgent, and might help compel the youth to care a bit more about doing something about the issues America still faces.\n\n**Section V: Other Miscellaneous Oddities, Quirks, and Embarrassments**\n\nSome of these are a bit more tongue in cheek, but here it goes:\n\n1. [I can't read this section heading without laughing](http://i.imgur.com/eoEpt1b.jpg)\n\n2. [Replace \"whites\" with \"trolls/orcs/goblins/elves/dwarves\" and you've got a passage straight out of *Lord of the Rings*](http://i.imgur.com/WuYwUbH.jpg)\n\n3. [The Dust Bowl is literally slavery](http://i.imgur.com/YFHyDGU.jpg)\n\n4. [We need to know the exact height of every president](http://i.imgur.com/E229qLz.jpg)\n\n5. [Groan inducing puns are everywhere](http://i.imgur.com/fSW1vbR.jpg)\n\n6. [You can't not have fat jokes about Taft](http://i.imgur.com/kWNJ68I.jpg)\n\n7. [What is this, a Paradox video game?](http://i.imgur.com/VvDBFyP.jpg)\n\n8. [Got enough quotation marks? Also nice idiom at the end there, brah](http://i.imgur.com/ZFd3Yb3.jpg)\n\n9. [Is there a competition among historians for who has the worst eyesight?](http://i.imgur.com/E0LiH5s.jpg)\n\n10. [I don't even know what to say about this one](http://i.imgur.com/Xs7o2eL.png)\n\n11. [The author sure does love to use the word \"orgy\". Bonus: More purple prose, some maybe even featuring eighth-grade-English-book-tier religious allusions!](http://imgur.com/a/XyNXd)\n\n12. Unfortunately I don't have a screenshot for this one, but the more recent edition of the text I had felt the need to namedrop Facebook in the last chapter. As if kids need to learn about that in school. Was it an attempt to stay hip with the latest kid \"lingo\", or shameless product placement paid for by Zuckerberg?\n\n~~~\n\nSo yeah, that's my *parodical purple treatise* on *The American Pageant*. I'm sure it's not the worst US History textbook on the market, but it sure has its issues. I may have been a bit too hard on it here, and to be fair its plague of problems helped to keep it interesting in its own special way (and it somehow helped to land me a 5 on the AP test!), but at the end of the day I'd still probably trade it for a clear and concise history, and a refund on the free time I lost wrapping my head around its anomalies while cramming for tests. Hell, I was 15/16 back then, I could have been out in the sunshine, having adventures and talking to girls instead of reading that crap. Then again, this was quite the nostalgic trip down memory lane, and I doubt any other textbook could compel me to write something like this. It's almost endearing in a weird sort of way. So for that I guess it deserves some sort of award?",

        "text": "Be gentle, guys, it's my first time, but I think [this thread] (http://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3f0byt/eli5_why_did_the_romansitalians_drop_their/) is riddled with errors.\n\nBasically, the OP is asking reddit to ELI5 why the Christianity replaced the various Roman religions as the most popular religion, why the Romans \"dropped\" their gods to follow the new faith. Some commenters are insisting it's because Rome really wasn't practicing religion seriously anymore, so it was easy to drop the old ways. That's not consistent with anything I've read, describing a time and place with a great deal of religious pluralism but serious religious commitment - hell, you had to be religious to be in the Senate and serve as consul. But not according to one commenter:\n\n&gt;...we can safely assume that at the time of Constantine few if any Romans believed in the literal existance of the twelve olympic gods. The predominant belief system of the Roman empire at the time was probably a mix of philosophical scepticism and newly imported middle-eastern cults such as Mithraism, Zoroastrianism and Christianity.\n\nThis doesn't seem to agree:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome\n\n&gt;For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.[1] Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city.[2] The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.\n\nI'm not sure what this next guy is driving at, but he seems to be suggesting politics replaced religion, that state authorities - because they were on the money - were the new gods:\n\n&gt;Simply put, it wasn't working; neither for the citizens or the ruling classes. It represented a paradigm shift in existential thought moving away from agricultural/nature worship (animal sacrifices, nature figureheads, etc) to socio-political symbolism and authority. This was a necessity when dealing with large, multi-cultural populations assimilated into urban coin based economies brought about by significant Roman conquest. \n\nOthers are saying Christianity was \"basically the same\" as the religion(s) it replaced. In my opinion, Gibbon provided the best answer to that and the whole thing:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christianity#Spread_of_Christianity\n\n&gt;Edward Gibbon (1737-1794), in his classic The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-1789), discusses the topic in considerable detail in his famous Chapter Fifteen, summarizing the historical causes of the early success of Christianity as follows: \"(1) The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which, instead of inviting, had deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses. (2) The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth. (3) The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church. (4) The pure and austere morals of the Christians. (5) The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the Roman empire.\"[67]\n\n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3f0fkb/australian_war_memorials_atrocious_account_of_the/",
        "text": "First time posting here. Be gentle.\n\nToday I present to you the official webpage of the Australian War Memorial, highlighting the Boxer Uprising (which I came across because I was about to answer a question about it on AskHistorians).\n\nhttps://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/boxer/\n\nI'm honestly a bit floored to see this composed this way. I guess I had the idea that the organisations running war memorials would be like... good... at history. They're really not doing themselves any favours with this page.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n&gt;During the nineteenth century the major European powers compelled the reluctant Chinese Empire to start trading with them. There was little the Chinese government wanted from the West at the time but there was a strong demand for opium among the population.\n\nAh yes, the Chinese and their love of opium. Say, since we're on the subject, how did this increased demand for opium come about anyway?\n\n&gt;In the Opium Wars of 1839-1842 and 1856-1860, the British forced the Chinese to accept the import of opium in return for Chinese goods, and trading centres were established at major ports. \n\nAh yes. Import imbalance. *That* was the most important part to highlight as a follow up sentence. Not coordinated efforts to push it on the population to create addiction and demand.\n\n&gt;The largest of these was Shanghai, where French, German, British, and American merchants demanded large tracts of land in which they asserted \"extra-territorial\" rights, meaning they were subject to the laws of their own country not China. In Shanghai a legendary sign in a park near one of the European compounds read: \"No dogs or Chinamen.\".\n\n(**edit:** Apparently I'd linked to some questionable people without realising it. Apologies. Point was that we simply have nothing more than hearsay that such a sign was there. No such sign shows up in photographs from the period, and the only writings on it are vague references. I'm going to bed now but I'll try to dig up something more substantial about it in the morning.)\n\nAside from it being shown time and time again that there is absolutely no evidence to support this claim, and aside from there being much better and more real ways in which Chinese access was limited in parts of Shanghai of the time, WHY WOULD YOU FOCUS ON THAT SIGN. Look extraterritoriality is *horrible*. There's no disputing that. But it also actually happened. Why wouldn't you focus on one of the many many *actual issues* faced by the Chinese under this oppressive system? Why instead just perpetuate a myth that's clearly a myth? It doesn't do either \"side\" any good to push this sign further down the throats of the masses. If your goal is education, how about you actually educate?\n\n&gt;The Chinese government's failure to resist inroads on its sovereignty and withstand further demands from the Europeans, such as the right to build railways and other concessions, caused much resentment among large sections of the population. This eventually led to the Chinese revolution of 1911 which toppled the imperial dynasty.\n\nNah man it's cool. She should have said \"no\" more strongly. Totally not on me.\n\nLet's jump to the part where they explain the Treaty of Nanjing or the Treaty of Tianjing. Oh wait they don't. Ok let's skip ahead to where they talk about the climate of the time leading up to the Boxer Uprising was one where people weren't happy with the mountain pressure of European colonialism, and how a very real manifestation of that faced daily by the people was the free reign afforded to missionaries. Oh that's not there either. In face they only mention the missionaries once:\n\n&gt;Missionaries and other civilians were killed, women were raped, and European property was destroyed.\n\nAll bad, but I take some issue with the last one in particular. It's not nearly of the degree of bad of murder and rape.\n\nI'll skip the rest. I'm unhappy enough with this post that I'd consider calling them when they're in the office to explain to them how problematic this telling is, but I don't imagine I'm in much of a position or with the right credentials to force a change. Posting here instead in the mean time.",

Earl grey, milk and sugar, if you're wondering.\n\n[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y58cNcrFjDw&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nSo, the video description is as follows:\n\n&gt;(History without the dumb dumb portrayal of evil)\n\n&gt;I guarantee I get accused more of negative isms than you do. Also a holocaust denier even though I flatly say all the time I don't deny holocausts. Problem is I also acknowledge the holocaust of Hamburg, Dresden, Frankfurt, Nagoya, Tokyo, Kobe, etc. and the murder of millions in Vietnam, North Korea, Iraq, Congo etc and the colonization of the Americas, Oceanic states, and much of Africa. And the tens of millions who starved or were work d to death under communist China and USSR. Yes the Axis raped and murdered and imprisoned people ... About 1/100 as much as The Allies countries have done which they have done for centuries and continue to do today. Japan and Germany have not died a shot in 75 years. Maybe if we understood the horrors and atrocities of France UK America and Russia we wouldn't have so much death and destruction today. Instead the word Nazi is the epitome of evil. It's the state religion. Hold up a sign that says I hate God and have another person hold a sign that says I hate Jews and see who gets attacked first. Evil people are not compared to Devils they are compared to nazis. Why not compare them to colonists? Colonization isn't even over. Israel continues to do it openly. The winners write the history. School text books are state indoctrination.\n\n[AYYYYY LMAO!](http://i.imgur.com/qVbMXmL.gif)\n\nLet's break it down. \n\n&gt;(History without the dumb dumb portrayal of evil)\n\nI dunno, I think it's pretty justifiable to call the nazis evil and portray them as such.\n\n&gt;blah blah blah, false equivalences\n\nwe know the drill. Intent is crucial in establishing genocide, stop with the whataboutism\n\n&gt;DAE ALLIZ KILLED AN RAPED EVERYONE\n\nwhile the allies did commit war crimes, it was not on nearly the scale of the germans or japanese. Or the italians, WRT use of gas in Ethiopia.\n\n&gt;poor poor nazis, being the epitome of evil! \n\n[~~Seriously. The devil punishes those who are damned to hell for all eternity.

You get what you pay for I guess.\n\n**00:00:52** almost at the one minute mark, it look like /r/combatfootage is leaking, but with shitty audio of gunfire over the top\n\n**00:01:00** a nice lady is telling me the german army suffered terribly during the first world war. Because, you know, I didn't know that. Also dead body pictures. lots of them\n\n**00:01:06** the germans suffered during the great depression too! poor germans, it's almost as if they were the agressors in the war!\n\n**00:01:15** sad music and footage from Versailles. poor poor germans. So sad\n\n**00:00:26** apparently the communists took berlin? I thought that the uprising was put down?\n\n**00:01:44** apparently inflation destroys morality? and only germany was affected by economic woes post-wwi, because the UK wasn't strapped for cash in an insane scale.\n\n**00:01:51** \"German cities were awash in pornography an prostitution.\" sounds fun. I still don't see the bad part that deserves the sad cello\n\n**00:02:05** I have yet to see anything other than be told how shitty germany is by this woman over archival footage. So far am not impressed.\n\n**00:02:13** \"the situation seemed hopeless. And then things changed dramatically\" Queue weimar? How about Hjalmar Schact? nope. You guessed it [THE NAZIS!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/HYkKdNX.jpg). You'd think they were highschoolers crushing. \"My life was terrible, but then I saw him, and suddenly it was worth living! *swoon*\"\n\n**00:02:19** [uplifting music] \"soon after the NSDAP was elected the german economy sprang to life, unemployment was erased, building boomed, great projects began.\" I'll let comrade /u/froghurt explain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1qr3b2/the_nazi_party_helped_pull_germany_out_of_a/)\n\n**00:02:39** \"germany became a happy hopeful nation again\" unless you were jewish. no source cited either\n\n**00:02:51** blah blah blah, sucking off hitler, he did nothing wrong, time man of the year, happy nazis\n\n**00:02:57** \"to many it seemed as if a new cultural, political, and economic renaissance for europe was at hand\" EXCUSE ME?!?!?? I... Yes, there were fascists, and many of them, but the use of this fucking weasel worded bullshit is really annoying because I can't refute it. Many people *did* believe this, probably. Many is a vague number.\n\n**00:03:06** jews apparenly envy the nazis. Also were working night and day to take germany down. This documentary is really vague. It says \"many people\" then has pictures of headlines about the boycott of german goods. UGHRGH\n\n**00:02:57** lel, nazi germany was the underdog guys! them plucky war criminals just standing up for what they believe in against the world! Never mind that they were the aggressor.\n\n**00:03:38** blah blah blah the nazis lost. What is more interesting are the photos from yalta, because I've got some very cool ones from the US Army Signal Corps Photographer's scrap book. [look here. they're cool](http://imgur.com/a/tiWnL)\n\n**00:03:51** \"Germany was subjected to pure hatred...\" well what do you expect after the way you treated the Russians and Jews and gypsies and Catholics and poles and Ukrainians and ruthenians and mentally disabled and Belorussians and Moldavians and communists and protestants who didn't agree with you and dissidents et alia.\n\n**00:04:00** \"germans, most of whom had little to do with the war, were raped, tortured, slaughtered, etc.\" yeeeeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... again, ye reap what ye sow. Maybe if you hadn't started the war, slaughtered the civilians, etc. etc. they wouldn't have been so pissed off as to brutalize you, germany.\n\n**00:04:15** ohhhh, this is about how germany was fucked up right after the war! That took long enough. We finally reached the opening credits.\n\n**00:04:38** they claim thomas goodrich is a historian, but he has no credentials, not even a wikipedia article.\n\n**00:04:50** OOOOOH! He's written about the ACW, Lincoln, and the indian wars too! Oh joy, oh rapture, I am not touching those with a ten foot pole.\n\n**00:05:08** \"the words you will hear are of the victims themselves and teh witnesses to these atrocities. There will be no attempt here to present the viewpoint of the other side, if you want that bluh bluh whining about our friend Victor\" Oh great, because that's in impartial source. *sigh* Still no citations. Not even as youtube annotations.\n\n**00:05:35** This film, like the book it's based on, apparently doesn't talk about what the germans \"allegedly did to the world\" because then you'd realize that what the germans did was quite evil.\n\n**00:05:51** apparently there are no words to describe the crimes as detailed to follow. I can think of a few: overblown, whataboutist, equivalentist, deserved, and trumped up.\n\n   &gt;whinging about Victor and his works of historical study continues, along with sad music and presumedly german people being meepey (mopey and weepey) and brutalized. As does the lack of sources. I'll stop mentioning it because I don't want to do a second by second overview.\n\n**00:06:17** apparently this is supposed to be a rallying cry to demand that nothing like the treatment of germans after the war ever happens anywhere again. Next time a country decides to go bat shit, start a world war, kill millions, bomb civilians, be racist, and other nazish things, they should get off scott free, because THE POOR POOR NAZIS. BOOO FUCKING HOOOOOOO I AM SO SADDENED BY THEIR LOSS OF THE WAR AND SUBSIQUENT TREATMENT. That said, the actual crimes against german civilians that occurred are deplorable.\n\n**00:06:35** TERROR BOMBING!!!! WOOWOWOWOWOWOOOO! [im so scurred](http://i.imgur.com/xXmEdll.jpg) I don't know where I was going with that, but it's a shitty graphic. Shame on you, movie.\n\n**00:07:28** it should be noted that the first pilots to bomb civilians were germans. Not that that makes the allied bomber offensive ok, but it's not like the germans weren't doing the same thing on what scale they could. It's not the allies fault for having more planes and bombs to drop.\n\n**00:08:15** [Schools](http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article248299.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/blitz-image-4-435826423.jpg) [churches](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/10/article-0-0B2EA52E000005DC-845_468x524.jpg) [hospitals](http://liverpoolblitz70.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mill-road-hospital1.jpg) [homes](http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/articles/blitzhouse.jpg) [ancient art](http://i3.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article3268585.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/the-bombed-out-hittite-gallery-at-liverpool-city-museum-in-may-1941-535209675.jpg) and [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christopher_Wren_churches_in_London#Destroyed_in_the_Blitz) you say?\n\nblah blah blah operation gomorrah. \n\nCombined bomber offensive etc etc. I don't see how this is unheard of? Am I supposed to be shocked? They were trying to end the war by bombing germany into submission. \n\nAlso, yeah, there was a lot of gore involved, that's what happens in war. People die. This is, of course, a new and exciting way of killing new people.\n\n**00:14:40** OOOH DRESDEN! I wrote a piece about dresden in reaction. [read it here](http://pastebin.com/zEKVX7ig) You know where else had towering cathedrals, irreplacable treasures, ornate palaces, and world renowned museums and art galleries? Leningrad. You know what city experienced the greatest cataclysm to ever happen to a city? Leningrad. You know what city wasn't german? FUCKING LENINGRAD. And the nazis did their best to flatten that, sooo, yeah. \n\n**00:19:56** I'm not sure what the point of this is? Like, yeah, we bombed the fuck out of the germans. That is a known fact. It isn't anything near the holocaust, it wasn't genocide, it's just a false equivalence. URGHGHGH\n\n**00:24:16** over 200,000 deaths! wow! that's like, almost a fifth as many civilians as died in leningrad. A city who had, before the war, a population greater than paris or rome, and more than double Los Angeles. A city of 3.5 million, reduced to 300,000 after the siege broke. In the first half of 1942 the city averaged 100,000 casualties *a month* Let that sink in.\n\n**00:26:13** the subtly named part 2, THE RAPE OF GERMANY!!!!!!!\n\n**00:26:24** why are these nice soviet-type chaps being called the evil from the east? DAMN YOU MONGOLIANS!\n\n**00:28:21** because the massacre of 72 civilians is the same as institutional reprisal massacres of tens of thousands across europe\n\n**00:30:12** WHY DOES IT MATTER THAT ILYA EHRENBURG IS JEWISH? OTHER THAN THAT HE MIGHT BE A BIT BITTER ABOUT THAT WHOLE HOLOCAUST THING?\n\n**00:30:34** an hour left. FML\n\n**00:31:26** oh, the mongols. Because asiatic hordes. WHY DO YOU DO THIS MOVIE?!?!????\n\n**00:32:11** \"... The communist commissars, the fanatical political officers composed almost exclusively of jews\" You know, sometimes when watching these you forget they're all made by nazis, and then they just casually slip some judeo bolshevism or whatever in there. Fucking hell.\n\nRAPE RAPE RAPE. ALSO JEWISH COMMISARS WANTED TO DEFILE THE CHURCHES OF GERMANY. BECAUSE STALIN WASN'T ANTI-RELIGION AT ALL. NOPE [NOT ONE BIT](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Christ_saviour_explosion.jpg)\n\nalso, remember the commissar order? How about the hunger plan? These are things the nazis did that were similar. Also rape, they did that too. And murder. And all sorts of bad shit. Like exterminate the poles and jews and gypsies and communists and other undesiriables.\n\n**00:38:12** soooo apparently millions were massacred, raped and enslaved? I mean, if you count german jews maybe?\n\n**00:38:26** PART THREE!!!!!!! THE BALTIC MASSACRE! (probably not as fun as \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree\")\n\n**00:38:42** lol the film just unironically called the occupied territories greater germany. \n\n**00:39:26** YOU KNOW WHERE ELSE IT WAS COLD AND EVERYONE FROZE OR STARVED? LENINGRAD. WHICH HAD IT MUCH WORSE THAN GERMANY DID, BECAUSE THE GERMANS HAD A MORE STEADY FOOD SUPPLY.\n\n**00:40:10** apparently flat stanley is based on german civilians that were pressed flat by soviet tanks? I guess it works with pigeons in the road and cars, so why not? It just seems kinda out of place. \"Hey Ivan, let's run over all these german civilians\" \"but Pasha, what if we throw a track, or something\" \"Fuck it, let's kill these german civilians for sport! and rape the bodies!\" \"YES COMMISAR ROSENBLATT! HAIL STALIN, BRINGER OF PEACE!\"\n\nSO MUCH DEATH. HOLY SHIT. I AM ALL FOR DEAD NAZIS, BUT IT GETS KINDA STALE AFTER 40 MINUTES. SIGH\n\nThey mention the Wilhelm Gustloff. Notable is the fact that though it had several thousand refugees on it, it was armed, and not marked as a hospital ship, and as such was a legitimate target for S-13.\n\n**00:49:54** PART IV DE feat. In Da West\n\n**00:51:02** so apparently the US army was even more hateful towards the germans than the USSR because of \"a decade of jewish propaganda\" and the US was just as rapey and murdery as the russians. \n\nAlso, I'm watching this, and it's very easy to think of this as just another wheraboo wank fest, but then it's like \"TEH JOOOOOZE\" and I remember that it's just nazi crap.\n\n**00:51:42** so, apparently Ike called for the massacre of nazi party members and army officers. Like 100,000 leaders should be exterminated? I've never heard this anywhere, so I might just be looking in the wrong places, or this is made up bullshit. \n\n**00:52:12** also, apparently, 10s of 1000s of german soldiers were summarially executed while surrendering. I don't know if they're talking about SS troops, who often were summarily executed, but it's rather unclear either way.\n\n**00:54:35** I think I'm supposed to feel bad for the executed camp guards here, but for the life of me, I can't. It might have something to do with them being NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP GUARDS. I dunno.\n\n**00:56:07** so apparently the allied troops were horrified that they were ordered to execute their prisoners, yet still harbored a deep hatred for the deutches volk.\n\n**00:56:14** LOOOOOOOOOOOL SS being good at fighting (they weren't. There was a wonderful BH post about it, but for the life of me I can't find it. It's 2:33AM here. I've been doing this for like 4 hours now.\n\n**00:56:40** Huh, I always thought it was the germans who summarily shot prisoners, ignored the Geneva convention, and neglected their POWs to the point where 1/3 of them died in the first year they were held. Weird.\n\n**00:57:13** oh no the allies let the victims out of the concentration camps. So terrible. How dare they.\n\nRAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE. STILL NO SOURCES ON AMERIKKKAN RAPES OR ANYTHING ELSE.\n\n**00:58:52** the \"jewish media\" releasing \"bloodthirsty propiganda\" nice one. Fuckin' nazis, man.\n\n**00:59:45** \"Eisenhower's pathological hatred of germans\". This hatred must be issued by the army when you reach a certain rank, since sherman had it too. Seriously, where do they get this shit, Eisenhower is a german name (eisenheuer)\n\n**00:59:48** PART PYAT'! DEATH CAMPS  \n^wait, ^I ^thought ^we ^weren't ^talking ^about ^that ^part ^of ^the ^war. ^Isn't ^that ^what ^they ^said ^at ^five ^minutes?\n\n**01:00:18** \"since Eisenhower couldn't kill more armed germans in war, the american desk general decided to kill disarmed germans in peace.\" SERIOUSLY WHERETHE FUCK DO THEY GET THIS? As an anecdotal counterpoint, a friend of mine's grandfather, Karl, was in the SS, was captured and sent to a POW camp in England where they let him roam around, learn english, go to the pub, etc. He said he liked it, apparently. But that must be propJEWganda.\n\n**01:00:34** only a half hour left. Thank god.\n\n**01:01:18** WOW WOAH WOW WOW WOOOOAH there nellie. You just called the US POW camps \"Concentration camps\". That's not the same at all.\n\n**01:01:31** and disease killed hundreds of thousands. Where did the bodies go then? I don't get this at all.\n\n**01:04:18** I guess the ebil amerikkkans just wanted to kill the germans, right? I don't even know where they're getting this. If this is a well documented thing, let me know, but it honestly seems to just be made up crap.\n\nAll this bullshit about Ike slaughtering prisoners is really grating. I've never heard anything about this. Fucking death camps? Oh for goodness sakes. \n\n**01:06:45** 600,000 german prisoners apparently died in american and french death camps post-wwii.

        "text": "A post a few days earlier on the ‘clash of civilisations’ brought out a few interesting viewpoints, including [one](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3eot0l/clash_of_civilizations_revisted_islam_is_and/ctgy7s4) with the rather controversial statement that: \n\n&gt;[Islam] was first spread by the sword\n\nThis, luckily, was quickly corrected by others, but the ensuing fracas between the two sides invoked more bad history rather than less. The study of early Islam has by no means developed a consensus yet. Instead, historians are more certain that that we know far less than we thought and fierce debates are still raging within academia right now. I am definitely not an expert on early Islam and most of my knowledge is a result of studying how early Islam interacted with the Roman Empire, but given my experience both here and at /r/AskHistorians, I feel that my input would still be useful, since the view that we know quite a bit about this enigmatic period of history is seemingly still quite popular. This is more of a rant than anything else, but I hope some of you will enjoy the read nonetheless!\n\n*****\n\n**Part I: The Revisionist Menace**\n\nI'll be very boring and begin by talking about historiography. This is very important though, because the study of early Islam has been transformed utterly from the 60s/70s. To make a long story short, before then, historians had a tendency to broadly trust the story as told by the Muslim sources, the vast majority of which date to the late eighth century or later, when studying the seventh century. This in itself is not a bad thing, since a lot of information can be derived from them, but this was often done at the expense of attention paid to earlier sources, particularly those in Syriac, Coptic and Armenian. Since then however historians have learnt that later sources can be critiqued and some of them even dismissed outright. This is actually the standard *modus operandi* for most medieval historians nowadays, because we can't trust our sources. They provide a lot of information, but we have to analyse them critically and try to understand the writers' motives. As a result, we no longer take the Venerable Bede or Gregory of Tours' conversion narratives of the Anglo-Saxons and the Franks seriously, nor do we examine Iconoclasm only from pro-Iconodule sources; these developments were, like the trend in Islamic studies, only accepted from the last few decades or so. The same approach has filtered into the study of early Islam, bringing the standard degree of scepticism into a field that still unfortunately has numerous orthodox positions that are rarely attacked (see [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3ds7pw/who_was_the_muqawqis_of_egypt_in_628632_and_would/ct8n6qs) for a discussion of the evidence against Muhammad dying in 632 for example). This is by no means an attack on Muslim beliefs, but instead just historians thinking critically about history, a fact that has unfortunately often been misinterpreted as offensive in recent years.\n\nThe most (in)famous work in this mould would be the ideas of the late Patricia Crone. As she rightfully noted in *Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World* (1977), a book co-written with Michael Cook:\n\n&gt; Virtually all accounts of the early development of Islam take it as axiomatic that it is possible to elicit at least the outlines of the process from the Islamic sources. It is however well-known that these sources are not demonstrably early. [...] The historicity of the Islamic tradition is thus to some degree problematic: while there are no cogent internal grounds for rejecting it, there are equally no cogent external grounds for accepting it. [...] The only way out of the dilemma is thus to step outside the Islamic tradition altogether and start again. \n\nMore recently, Chase Robinson wrote an excellent article outlining the value of Patricia Crone's contribution in B. Sadeghi (ed.), *Islamic Cultures, Islamic Contexts:\nEssays in Honor of Professor Patricia Crone* (2014):\n\n&gt; As far as the historiography of early Islam is concerned, the burden of proof has shifted decisively: what was once effortlessly assumed is now painstakingly documented. In fact, much of what was radical in the 1970s and early 1980s is now middle-of-the road, the radical fringe now occupied by those who deny what so-called revisionists freely concede, e.g., that Muḥammad existed or that the conquests took place. It is largely due to the skeptical turn that the once-sleepy field of early Islamic historiography has changed beyond recognition, and so, too, the study of early Islamic documentary and material culture (e.g., archaeology, epigraphy, papyrology, and numismatics). It is upon the basis of such sources that matters once settled (such as the nature of the earliest Islamic state) are now subject to stimulating controversy\n\nA pithier summary would be this:\n\n&gt; The natural vice of historians is to claim to know about the past.\n\n*Hagarism* is famous for being controversial and its thesis is almost certainly wrong, but it asked the right questions. The traditional narrative of early Islam is problematic, simply because later sources are often favoured over earlier, fragmentary and sometimes contradictory evidence. Of course, early sources are often wrong as well, but they should still be incorporated into the study of early Islam. Likewise, some revisionists go too far and throw out all later Muslim sources. Surely a synthesis of the two would be the best approach? This is the approach taken by most historians in the present day and the position I myself follow.\n\nSo why is this important anyway? Get to the bad history, I hear you ask. Well, take a look at this:\n\n&gt; [I am actually trying to find some other things showing the same, but am only finding more Islamic writing on the subject, which doesn't count as real evidence to me.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3eot0l/clash_of_civilizations_revisted_islam_is_and/cti32px)\n\nThis sentiment is found amongst many people unconvinced by historians of religion, best seen perhaps in the 'controversy' over whether Jesus was a real historical figure. However, there is a degree of truth in this statement, albeit a very small one. A response to this cannot just be a defence of Muslim sources, as they are problematic (which is actually no different from any other historical source), but should instead be a more nuanced one, an answer that is aware of how little we know for certain, as well as one that defends the value of unreliable sources. As it is currently, the answers are (from my perspective) not compelling, with this [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3eot0l/clash_of_civilizations_revisted_islam_is_and/ctifqc2) being particularly troubling. Understanding all of this is indeed very difficult, so I don't blame anyone. Below is my attempt at finding a middle-way between the two positions, one that hopefully explains why both extremes are bad ways of doing history, but I am happy to be corrected and fully acknowledge that there are multiple interpretations out there of the same evidence.\n \n*****\n\n**Part II: The Community of Believers**\n\n&gt; [Islam would not have gained traction in medieval Arabia without violence. While it is true Islam was first preached to gain SOME converts, they were also run out of the city. That whole flight to Mecca \\(sic\\) thing was because there were some converts, and a whole lot of people who did not like that. When they returned, they took Yathrib (sic) by force. According to Muslims, it was this flight and return which marks the beginning of their religion.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3eot0l/clash_of_civilizations_revisted_islam_is_and/cth0dvl)\n\nThis is a fairly simple point to counter. At no point in the story we have from the earliest Islamic sources did Muhammad resort to the sword to convert his fellow Meccans. Instead, it was his friends and family who converted first, followed by others, both local bigwigs and downtrodden slaves. I don't see how Muhammad, a merchant, could muster up enough power to forcibly convert anyone, especially since he had to be protected by his uncle throughout this period. If anything, I see the peaceful beginning of Muhammad's preaching in Mecca as the moment when his movement gained traction: here, he gained followers that would follow him into exile and stay at his side until his death, eventually steering the movement towards territorial conquest. Without these willing converts, early Islam would have surely been very different.\n\nThis however is only the story as told by later Muslim traditions and recent revisionist historians have proposed numerous interesting and contradictory theories about the nature of early Islam. So what do they say about Muhammad's life in Mecca? It's a good idea to consult the *New Cambridge History of Islam I* (2010) here, as it summed up a lot of the recent historiographical developments:\n\n&gt; Exactly how the revelations were received cannot be known in any detail either. The lists and accounts of early converts more clearly reflect controversies about post-Prophetic politics than they do Prophetic history. [...] Nor can much be said about how the polytheist establishment responded to Muhammad’s prophetic claims.\n\nTo piece together the events in Mecca, the best source would be the Qur'an, an early document from the 630s and based on earlier uncollected teachings.\n\n&gt; The Qur'an itself makes plain that many Meccans quite naturally took him to be a magician, soothsayer or otherwise possessed. There were other reasons to find Muhammad objectionable. As a ‘warner’ in the tradition of early prophets, he emphasised man’s accountability to God, His power, the rewards of Heaven and the punishment of Hell. He also levelled criticism against the prevailing social norms, railing against female infanticide and the abuses of wealth. None of this apparently sat well with the polytheist establishment, especially because he came to attack its gods and claim the Ka'ba for the One God. As his followers grew in number and Muhammad grew in stature, the opposition to his movement stiffened.\n\nBeyond that, I don't think we can say anything for certain about the nature of the dispute in Mecca. Some people may argue that using only the Qur'an is a bad way of doing history, but unfortunately for most things in late antiquity historians have to rely on just one source - the Qur'an is no different in this respect. If we ignore this invaluable source, then we literally have nothing else to replace it. All sources are biased, so that in itself is not a barrier, and as long as it is examined critically, there is no reason not to use the Qur'an as evidence. \n\nThings got more interesting when Muhammad reached Yathrib/Medina, as a new community of both Muslims and non-Muslims was created. The OP however had this to say:\n\n&gt; Well, according to Islam, he was invited. Though, after other people claimed that, I tried to find contemporary writing elsewhere saying that was the case, to no effect. But let's say it is true...HE was invited. With a few of his followers. Which very quickly turned into near complete dominance over all aspects of life in the city and surrounding areas. THAT is conquer. Whether done by military, economic, socio-political, or religious means, taking a place over from the populace, and drastically restructuring in the view of the new controllers, is conquer.\n\nModern Western scholarship now leans more towards the view that the early *umma* (community) was a rather inclusive one. Fred Donner's *Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam* (2010) for example argued for an ecumenical apocalyptic movement that included Christians, Jews and 'Qur'anic pagans', one with the goal of attacking polytheism and to prepare for the end times. This is perhaps most clearly seen in this document preserved in the first biography of the Prophet:\n\n&gt; In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. This is a document from Muhammad, God’s prayers and peace be upon him, between the believers and Muslims of the Quraysh and Yathrib, and those who followed them, joined them and struggled with them. They are a single community (umma) to the exclusion of [other] people\n\nIt was no doubt a religious community, but not one just for Muslims. Though the degree to which the new movement was inclusive is debatable and Donner's thesis is by no means agreed upon by everyone, it is important to stress that from the start Islam was not out to convert monotheistic non-Muslims. In a sense, these ecumenical ideas were already present in Arabia, as Christians, Jews and pagans of both monotheist and polytheist varieties were all present in the peninsula. Some degree of co-operation and toleration was therefore the norm, though obviously violence on a large scale also happened, such as the massacre of Christians at Najran by a Jewish king of Yemen in the early sixth century. But even then, events such as the pogrom at Najran had a multi-faith cast. Miaphysite Christians and 'Nestorian' Christians were all massacred by a Jewish king, who probably seized power from a Christian. There were also Jews from Palestine involved in this for some reason and arbitration was later sought from a pagan Arab king. Then there were the miaphysite Ethiopians and Chalcedonian Romans who intervened in favour of the local Christians, which was in turn countered by the Zoroastrian Persians. There was even some kind of syncretic Jewish-pagan faith active in the region. Arabia in late antiquity was a super-diverse place and it was from this context that Islam was born, so it cannot but be influenced by the complex history it inherited. \n\nIn any case, there are basically no contemporary sources for Muhammad's time in Medina aside from the Qur'an and the document I quoted above, *The Constitution of Medina*, though I know some people doubt their dating as well. So in this respect, the OP's criticism was correct and we shouldn't go too far in defending the historicity of certain events. But still, even in this instance it seems hard to justify the view that Islam was forcibly imposed on Medina. Muhammad had little to no power at this point, so I doubt that he was able to overcome all the entrenched interests in Medina only through force. There were also political and social factors involved as well. Too often people studying religious history will only look at the evidence from a religious lens - as Muhammad was by all accounts a charismatic and politically astute individual, why couldn't he have achieved power and influence at Medina through more bog-standard means of persuasion? If we see this as an example of 'conquest', then we might as well call all our politicians conquerors as well.\n\nEven if we take the traditional narrative at face-value, that the Jews were in a subordinate position in this new community, forced conversions did not happen until they acted against Muhammad. Modern narratives of the Arab conquests meanwhile, such as Robert Hoyland's *In God's Path: The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire* (2015), who actually argued against Donner's thesis, persuasively made the point that Christian and Jewish Arabs did take part in the conquests themselves; there is a reason the conquests are often described as 'Arab' rather than 'Islamic' after all.\n\nOne last thing... the reconquest of Mecca (not Yathrib as the OP described it) was universally seen as almost a bloodless affair. By then, Muhammad's power had grown to an extent that his Meccan enemies were no longer inclined to fight to the bitter end. This is not to say that violence was not part of early Islamic history, it surely must have, but I think it would be a good idea to contextualise it a bit. The world of late antiquity was a violent place and the seventh century was a century dominated by holy wars. To understand the origins of Islam, we would have look beyond Arabia and examine the 'last great war of antiquity'.\n\n******\n**Part III: An Age of Iron** \n\nAmidst the devastating Roman-Persian war of 603-628, Jerusalem fell to the Persians in 614, an event that left its mark in the minds of many contemporaries. It was a disaster \"worthy of unceasing lamentations\" for a Constantinopolitan chronicler and unleashed chaos in Palestine, a little-known consequence of the war that was recorded in two contemporary monastic texts:\n\n&gt; For Ishmaelites descended upon our laura [monastery] one week before the attack upon the holy city, and pillaged all the church’s holy vessels, and most of the fathers fled at once. \n\n... and:\n\n&gt; When the Persians invaded and surrounded the holy city, then both the brothers in the coenobium and those in cells left, some fleeing to Arabia with the higoumen, others entering into caves, and others hiding in Calamon [...] But the Saracens inspected the wadi, and searched the heights for people among them. They discovered the elder [George] and many of the other fathers, and took them to another wadi, where they killed from their number Abba Stephan [...], the others they put into captivity\n\nInterestingly, these two texts also tell us that Arab raiders were already striking into Palestine at this point (a similarly early raid was attested to in Iraq as well). This was actually pretty common, since Arabs had been involved in the wars between Rome and Persia for centuries and their raids had been a fact of life for people on the frontier for a very long time. Arabs however had also defended imperial territories from raiders, since many groups served the two great empire of late antiquity as border patrols and as a result had a great deal of influence in the borderlands. It was an interconnected world, even for Arabs deep within Arabia, and violence was a key part of it. The Arab conquests cannot be separated from the damage it wrought, but that also normalised it to an extent. If war was already endemic, then surely the damage cannot be wholly blamed on Arabs alone? To what extent can Islam explain the escalation of the attacks as time went on?\n\nEven holy war was a part of the fixture of the time. Aside from the ideologically driven sack of Jerusalem, whilst Muhammad was busy building up support in the late 620s, the Roman emperor Heraclius was happily burning his way through Persia, with special attention being paid to Zoroastrian fire-temples. In the years to come, he would forcibly convert Jews within his empire (an edict that was even influential in distant Francia) and impose a new Christological formulation on his subjects, which in turned ushered in a number of revolts and consumed the energy of the Roman state even as it faced a new dire threat in the shape of the caliphate. \n\nIn this respect therefore Islam was not particularly exceptional in religious terms, even if we take at face-value all the reports of its early excesses. Even if we ignore the evidence from the Qur'an, it still makes sense that Muhammad would be aware of the world crisis unfolding around him and the eschatological tensions it caused. The end of the world was coming and God would soon punish mankind for their sins; re-affirming their faith in God was therefore very necessary. This is not a justification for the violence this process involved, only an attempt to explain why it happened and why it made sense at the time. As mentioned above, we also have to take into account other factors as well, such simple human greed and various social/political motivations - I mean, frontier warfare had been characterised by this sort of thing for centuries, so why would it suddenly stop now? Regardless of the cause of this mess, it definitely wasn't a clash of civilizations, but instead an instance of how different cultures can profoundly influence each other.\n\nStill, examples of Muslim atrocities are legion in the earliest sources, but allow me to direct you to [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/305ahf/what_did_the_byzantines_think_about_islam_when/) instead of a detailed break-down here. I collected there many of the earliest sources for early Arab attacks on the Roman Empire and most mention a massacre or two. I however pointed out that we cannot read the sources so simply and that there were many reasons why they portrayed the Arabs so negatively. Indeed, if we look at the Near East from an archaeological perspective, little damage was actually done by the conquests. As for why this was so, Hoyland summarised the key points nicely in his new book:\n\n&gt; From this perspective the Arab conquests began as an Arab insurrection, that is, the early conquerors were not invaders coming from outside the empire but insiders trying to seize a share of the power and wealth of the Byzantine state. This helps explain why the Arab conquests were not particularly destructive: the leadership already had close acquaintance with the empires and they wanted to rule it themselves, not destroy it. \n\n&gt; [...] But the Arabs did not only employ military means to further their aims. They also made heavy use of agreements to respect life, property, and customs in return for submission and tribute. Such agreements were part of an ancient Middle Eastern tradition of rules for military engagement, examples of which exist from as far back as the third millennium BC.\n\nAt this point, someone might bring up the 'classic' answer to how early Muslims treated non-Muslims: the choice of conversion, paying the jizya, or death. In reality however things were far more complicated and this represented a much later attempt at simplifying the narrative. From the earliest sources, whether non-Muslim or the accounts of scholars such as al-Baladhuri (one of the first Arab historians of the seventh-century conquests), innumerable different kinds of deals were made. Ad-hoc agreements were the norm and we should be careful about generalising the ways by which the Arabs were able to secure the locals' co-operation. More importantly, as I have repeatedly emphasised here, we don't know enough to come up with a simple elegant theory, if it is even possible.\n\n*****\n\n**A Byzantine Conclusion**\n\n&gt; [I don't like the renaming of Istanbul because it was named after a military genius, an emperor of incredibly historical significance, and someone with a tenacity I admire. If they had renamed Byzantium to Istanbul, I wouldn't care. It is just the loss of Constantine's city I dislike. But I don't think that makes it actually WRONG.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3eot0l/clash_of_civilizations_revisted_islam_is_and/cti9fp0)\n\nIstanbul was actually derived from the Greek εις την Πόλιν [eis ten polin, 'to the city'], which was the term many Byzantine Greeks used to refer to Constantinople. It was a term familiar to many Muslims in the Middle Ages and so it became the city's name in Turkish as well. Rather than complaining about how it was a term imposed by the Muslims, I see it as a fascinating case of cross-cultural exchange, one that instead demonstrated both the influence of Roman rule and cultural acceptance on behalf of the Turks in the long-term. \n\nThis to some extent also explains my line of thinking throughout this post. History is a dynamic process and change is a key part of that. so I feel that a student of history shouldn't really 'dislike' something that happened. Instead, why not look at it as an interesting phenomenon that makes us think about ourselves? There are enough problems in the world today, no need to look in the past for injustices to righteously condemn as well.",

        "text": "[The Ball started on the Oxford Journal of Social History 36.2 (2002) 405-429 in 2002, but here is the 2004 version from the Prof’s website.](http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/no-irish.htm)\n\n[Or if you like Ads and a shorter version, a slightly abridged version is available From Irish Central](http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/no-such-thing-as-no-irish-need-apply-signs-argues-history-professor-211727201-237597051.html?page=1&amp;showAll=y)\n\nProf. Jensen says very clearly that there never were No Irish Need Apply signs for jobs in the 19th century US or the 18th, because he went looking and couldn't find them. Then goes on to do some clever extrapolation, based on his failure to locate. \n\n&gt;The fact that Irish vividly \"remember\" NINA signs is a curious historical puzzle. There are no contemporary or retrospective accounts of a specific sign at a specific location. No particular business enterprise is named as a culprit. No historian, 2 archivist, or museum curator has ever located one 3 ; no photograph or drawing exists. 4 No other ethnic group complained about being singled out by comparable signs. Only Irish Catholics have reported seeing the sign in America—no Protestant, no Jew, no non-Irish Catholic has reported seeing one. This is especially strange since signs were primarily directed toward these others: the signs said that employment was available here and invited Yankees, French-Canadians, Italians and any other non-Irish to come inside and apply. The business literature, both published and unpublished, never mentions NINA or any policy remotely like it. The newspapers and magazines are silent. The courts are silent. There is no record of an angry youth tossing a brick through the window that held such a sign. Have we not discovered all of the signs of an urban legend?\n\nThat’s very strong. Not only no signs, but the discrimination was imaginary and a psychological ploy to allow the Irish in the US to bully other people. \n\n&gt; The myth justified bullying strangers and helped sour relations between Irish and everyone else \n\nAnd \n\n&gt;the NINA phenomenon is an ahistorical memory to be explained by ‘delu[sional]’ group psychology and ‘the political need to be bona-fide victims’ rather than by the fact of historic discrimination… \n\n\nThe problem comes when you read the article, and his evidence of non-existence, is the fact that there’s a lack of evidence explained by his inability to find one. Despite memories of them and the fact that they were common in England and Northern Ireland for a century or more. But the kicker isn’t the signs. But his implication in the lack of them, also indicating that the lack of signage indicated a lack of discriminatory practices. \n\n13 years and a few Google updates later, a  Student goes looking and shows that the phenomenon attempting to bar the Irish from even applying was more widespread than the Professor professed. \n\n[Same Journal Current Issue]( http://intl-jsh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/03/jsh.shv066.full.pdf+html) \n\n[Here’s the Abstract Page](http://jsh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/03/jsh.shv066.abstract) \n\nAnd covered in [Irish Central for those without a link through their Uni or Library ](http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/High-school-student-disproves-professors-theory-that-No-Irish-Need-Apply-signs-never-existed.html) \n\n&gt;Fried challenges Jensen’s claim that “the NINA phenomenon is an ahistorical memory to be explained by ‘delu[sional]’ group psychology and ‘the political need to be bona-fide victims’ rather than by the fact of historic discrimination.”\n\n&gt;Instead, she writes, “the documentary record better supports the earlier view that Irish-Americans have a communal recollection of NINA advertising because NINA advertising did, in fact, exist over a substantial period of United States history, sometimes on a fairly widespread basis\n\nKeep in mind, how strongly he stated the phenomenon didn’t exist. She’s not saying that every window had one, but that it did happen, enough in advertising for jobs to be noticable,  and that she can prove it, with sources. And then she makes an excellent case to show that his implications are not sound. \n\n[Added Bonus Level:   The Professor and the Foil meet again in the comments. And he still can't own up. But they keep it civil.  He tries some head patting, so good job kid, and some ego posting, and he eventually moves the goal posts to, “I was only talking about the signs, and not really about discrimination against the Irish.” but it doesn’t work, mainly because of how strongly his own argument was worded: and the unproved implications of his argument.](http://imgur.com/a/OIdSZ)\n\nLink above to fantastic album of comments from  www.reddit.com/u/fungwah . Be sure to say thank you people. \n\nIt’s bad history because you have a Professional Historian calling out bad history in an article in 2002, being called out on his own bad history in 2015, and then “Can’t Google” and “Lol. The Internet is better now” face off in the comments where the Prof. tries to save face, and is clearly on the defensive, and the uppity youngster is cheekily polite. A good show all around. \n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3eot0l/clash_of_civilizations_revisted_islam_is_and/",
        "text": "https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3elwc2/slug/ctgbynx\n\nI'l begin by saying that Samuel Huntington, for all his numerous faults, did not actually conceive of the *Clash of Civilizations* as civilization vs un-civilization. The plural, after all, is key. He was making a fairly interesting an nuanced point I vehemently disagree with but needs to be seen within the historical context in which it was made, that is the post-Cold War \"End of History\" western liberal triumphalism. However, his revival of this particular civilizational thesis has percolated through popular culture largely in the form of a very different form of right wing ideology. And thus you have the sorts of statements fit for a British colonial officer unironically sipping tea updated for a modern Europe:\n\n&gt;Islam is and always has been a threat to the safe existence of civilised culture.\n\nNow of course there are many different ways to approach this. I suppose the easiest is to wonder when Islam attacked classical Athens, or ancient Egypt, or Edo Japan, or classical Khmer, but that is really just too easy. Or you could ask when Pakistan colonized Britain, or Algeria France. Or you could ask who, in a war between the Safavids of Iran and the Ottoman Turks, constituted the \"civilized culture\" and the \"threat\". You know what, this hangs too low, I'll let someone else handle it. I will only add that if they want to live in a world without chicken tikka masala and doner kebab that is their choice, before skipping to the next historical theory:\n\n&gt;Up until the sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols, Islam was probably the intellectual center of the world.\n\nGood old class of civilizations replaced by sequence of civilizations. This is an argument that I really, really wish would just die because it is an ineffective counter and it perpetuates two eally prevalent notions: one, that civilization should be seen as monolithic, with, for example, the fall of Rome passing the mantle of civilization to the middle east, and the sack of Baghdad passing it to Italy or something. It also just generally isn't true, because as impressive as the schools of Baghdad were it isn't as if they were overflowing with Chinese scholars, and I am reasonably certain there were no Nahuatl there either. But it also ignores more recent contributions from the Muslim world: what about the architectural wonders of Sinan Mimar? The Persian miniatures of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries? The literature of the Mughal court poet Faizi? *What about coffee?*\n\n&gt;Germany was a center for industrial advancement between WWI and WWII, and again not long after WWII, despite crippling debt repayments, war restitutions, being firebombed into the ground, invaded, divided between two competing superpowers, and having a lot of its intellectual talent poached, still managed to be relevant within 50 years.\n\nWehraboos? In *my* KiA?\n\nAlso let's not forget that post WWII Germany had industry rebuilt due to the financial might of a superpower rather than its population deported and irrigation networks destroyed.\n\n&gt;That was 800 AD. I think it's time for that claim to stop being relevant.\n\nMongol time machine.\n\nAnyway, there is some great stuff in the rest of the thread to pick out, particularly when they focus on the number one neoreactionary punching bag, Sweden:\n\n&gt;its kind of sad Sweden used to be one of the freest most equal countries, now the country is known for having some of the highest rape stats in Europe.\n\n&gt;&gt;Sweden used to be one of the most powerful nations in Europe, to the point where they curbstomped the HRE and the Habsburg during the thirty-year war and lead to the rise of the Swedish empire, it was their greatest time ever.... then they got into a war with Russia and the Swedish king decided \"hey, it's winter! Let's march on Moscow!\"\n\nThat's right, Charles XII was defeated by SJWs.",

        "text": "This is a show by H2 in which \"America is full of archaeological secrets buried in the earth. In this series, forensic geologist Scott Wolter -- considered a real-life Indiana Jones by some -- travels across the country to uncover some of the hidden treasures and to reveal the history associated with them, discovering in the process that there is a lot Americans don't know about the country's past, and the history that people do know may not always tell the whole story. Ancient symbols, religious relics and other artifacts that Wolter unearths indicate that various civilizations have left their mark on the nation.\" First off, this show is on Netflix, at least the first season. I have never watched this show before, and it was recommended to me by a friend as a sort of \"look at this stupid show\". I am going to watch each episode, and in a similar fashion to match threads on /r/soccer or /r/mls, do a time recap. I will attempt to use pictures from the show. My R5ing isn't going to be perfect as I am not an expert on the Mayan peoples, but I am able to use the internet and read so it should be more accurate than this show.For example:\n\n19:02. Scott says \"Mayans are from outer space\".\n\nI say, [no they're not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica) you fraud. \n\nAlso, I will come up with 24 words for this episode for a bingo game. I think I'll have 10 that will always be there, 5 events I think will happen, and at the end of this review and each subsequent review, I will say what the next episode will be about and you guys can come up with 10 words that should be in the bingo. I then will put it in, randomize it and dive in. Here goes!\n\n**Words that'll be in all Bingos**: possible cover-up, a professional debunks his theories, Knights Templar, mythical beings, \"pre-Columbian\", terrible archaeology, psuedo-science, gets proven wrong and doesn't accept it, visiting America over 1000 years ago, state archaeologist.\n\n**Actions**: drives like there's no tomorrow, \"alleged\" turns into \"definite\", ghost-cam, mentions Minnesota (his home state), ominous music for no reason, talks about his book \n\n**This episode only**: talks about Mayan sacrifices, finds a burial mound, Chichen Itza, mixes up Aztec and Maya, sees a pointy stone and calls it an arrowhead, doesn't talk to any Native Americans, spooky shot of a Georgia forest, aliens, Columbus, \n\nPlease add ideas for next episode's bingo, which is called Medieval Desert Mystery and has this tagline: Wolter investigates a burial site in the mountains of Arizona and believes it may belong to a medieval Englishman.\n\n[Bingo Link](http://imgur.com/PSSIe0n). Print along and play with me!\n\n00:30. So far we have some forests in Georgia with text over it talking about how this place called the Track Rocks are \"controversially linked to Mayans\" and \"Federal Authorities blocked access to the site\". Flashing in and out, are some step pyramids that are filmed using the Ghost Hunter effect. I'm intrigued. However, I have \"possible cover up\" and \"mentions Minnesota\" checked off on my bingo!\n\n01:30. Apparently the government won't let him in to Track Rock. However, when I googled it, [they tell you it's free](http://imgur.com/89cXyrj). Maybe they just don't want some crackpot to go digging in the *hey wait a minute*. Also got [\"drives like there's no tomorrow.\"](http://imgur.com/s8kMgEc)\n\n02:00. The opening credits roll. I will admit they did a nice job with them, they look ok. Basically the show is about Scott Wolter who goes around to discover the \"real history of America\". It's worth noting that Mr. Wolter describes himself as a \"forensics Geologist.\" Also, according to [this](http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/scott-wolters-apparently-non-existent-degree) he just made up his degree. He has spent lots of time working on the [Kensington Rune Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Runestone) which is largely accepted to be a [hoax](http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/Kensington.shtml).\n\n04:51. He will see a Native American historian who also believes that there is a Mayan connection to the Track Rock site. So I guess I won't get that one on my bingo. \n\n05:30: He gets to the historians house. The [shot](http://imgur.com/HQDdz3O) is VERY ominous. It looks like a storm is about to hit.\n\n05:45. \"Well I mean it's not even a theory, it's a fact.\" Well lets just put all our cards on the table right away. \n\n08:45. The 2 men have a mini vent session about how the academic community normally tries to \"cover things up\" and how when the \"academic community thinks there's nothing there, that makes me more inquisitive.\" Still waiting for Mayan proof. \n\n10:00. The historian, Richard Thornton, is convinced that these [terraces](http://imgur.com/VcljhUV) have something to do with Mayans. This is a GCI topographical map they made, so I can't say how accurate it is. To be fair to him, the Mayans apparently DID use [terraces to farm](http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/pesek/), as did many other civilizations. It's not like the Mayans had a monopoly on terrace farming. \n\n10:30. \"If they won't let me hike in, maybe I'll fly in\" \nMission Impossible 6: The Mayan Conspiracy\n\n11:00. We're going on a plane! Apparently, they're going to use LiDAR which seems to be a thing that can make a topographical map by scanning the ground. \n\n12:07. We get to our first commercial break. [These](http://imgur.com/ZHpBrfG) are our clues so far. We already know there are ruins, it's a Native American site. Remember, that's the reason Scott couldn't get a permit?? Scott said the word archaeoastronomy 1 time and didn't even discuss it further. Finally, I'm not sure how terracing proves that there were Mayans there. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_(agriculture), Terracing was common all around the world. So far, the evidence isn't proving anything. Oh, and [this](http://imgur.com/ClziOIC) is the Bingo scorecard so far.\n\n15:46. We're going on a roadtrip to Athens, GA, site of the [Forsyth Petroglyph](http://imgur.com/GeO2Pcf). He touches said rock in its no no place, takes tons of photos and shines a flashlight on it.  \n\n16:15. \"I think the rock looks better wet than if it was dry.\"\n\nSays the guy who was touching it in a creepy manner a couple seconds ago\n\n17:00. Mr. Wolter meets with an expert Gary Daniels, who has written a [series of well-researched books.](http://www.amazon.com/Gary-Daniels/e/B009GKFX1Q) So now they're convinced that the rock is a star map. According to the show, the Mayans and the Creek peoples \"used the same symbols.\" I googled the Forsyth Petroglyph and found [this](http://esrara.org/rock-art-sites/). According to the website \"Archaeologists believe that the petroglyphs were made by ancestors of the Creeks or Cherokees dating back to Late Woodland period (c. AD 1000).\"\n\n18:12. Now the same expert on Mayan cultures is talking with Scott about [Mayan Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_blue) which is a clay that contains Palygorskite clay, which apparently is abundant in GA but hard to find in Mexico. When I googled palygorskite, the Wikipedia page talked about how it was found in South East USA. According to [sciencedaily.com](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090420085049.htm), palygorskite was found on the Yucatan peninsula by scientists attempting to discover the source of the Maya blue. \n\n19:00. They now are talking about how a [plate](http://imgur.com/qU3uzhb) found in Georgia has the same markings as a carving on Chichen Itza. That's one for the bingo card! However, we don't see pictures of the actual plate, just what looks like drawings. Then he talks about how a site in GA had supposed cranial deformation evidence. Both of these things, along with Maya blue are him just throwing darts to see if one hits.\n\n19:30. He gets angry about how the academic community is trying to cover this up again. Same old, same old. I think we're going to Ocmulgee, where the supposed cranial deformation happened.\n\n20:00. [The forest](http://imgur.com/UVIYgtS) isn't spooky. However, the [spider](http://imgur.com/crwbQs7) that they showed 3 different shots of is kind of scary.\n\n20:45. Scott Wolter asks the researcher what he thinks of Richard Thornton's work (the first expert). His answer is the best non-answer ever: \"You know, Mr. Thornton has presented a hypothesis and that hypothesis needs to be tested. Is the Track Rock site a Mayan site? You know, I don't know. Could it be? Absolutely, it could be, but we're never gonna know that as long as the academics are insisting that it can't be.\" Gary Daniels doesn't even answer the question, which leads me to believe that he think Mr. Thornton doesn't know what he's talking about. Coincidentally, that's my opinion.  \n\n21:30. They get to the mound in question, and some [CGI](http://imgur.com/h1DTSzb) tries to depict that it has layers. Apparently, [Xochitecatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xochitecatl) in Mexico is [\"THE only other site in North America\"](http://imgur.com/T4TRsAz) that has a spiral mound, which I found hard to believe. I googled Spiral Mounds, and came accross a bunch of other ones, such as the Wycliffe Mounds in KY, the Spiro Mounds of OK, and more. It's worth noting they barely spent a half minute of some far away footage on the mound before going to photos of it.\n\n23:50. Apparently because the Mayaimi, Mayayuaca, and Mayaca all have \"Maya\" in their name, they are descended from Mayans. The [Mayaimi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayaimi) take their name from nearby Lake Okeechobee which back then, was called Mayaimi which meant \"big water\". [Mayaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayaca_people) was apparently the Spanish name for that tribe. Scott Wolter, in his infinite wisdom, asks \"Is there a connection to Miami?\". Yes Scott there is. Miami was named after the Mayaimi people, who named themselves after Lake Okeechobee, not the Mayans.\n\n24:00. We have reached our 2nd commerical break. [These](http://imgur.com/CFReCR1) are the clues so far. The first 2 he hasn't really talked about. The mound spiraling, ok, I suppose you can count that. The last 2 are only hearsay, he hasn't actually shown ANY evidence to support either iconography or cranial deformation in Georgia. [This](http://imgur.com/uLtchrG) is our bingo.\n\n24:50. They see a mound with an entrance pointing East and because no other civilization other than the Mayans have ever done that, it must be Mayan. Also, we're going to Mexico to visit Chichen Itza. Among some shots of Wolter marching through an airport set to epic music, it is explained that if he finds something that looks close to what he's seen in GA, the link has been proven. \n\n26:30. We meet Archaeologist Alfonso Morales in Mexico, and travel to Chichen Itza. This time, Wolter is in the back of the car, but they still have the epic driving shots. When Wolter tells Morales his theory, Morales says it's possible. Mr. Wolter is surprised and says, \"Oh, so you agree with the speculation?\"\n\n27:45. Morales implies that Wolter has a lack of evidence, so this guy might be kind of smart. I wonder how the show got him?\n\n28:15. Wolter tries to explain archaeoastronomy to Morales. Morales gives him a look that says \"I know what archaeoastronomy is you idiot,\", but only counters with \"Right.\"\n\n28:45. Wolter mentions he saw a rock with spirals and a spiral mound in Georgia. Cue the minute long footage of panning over parts of Chichen Itza and outlining the spirals in blue. I still don't see the link, I'm pretty sure the Mayans didn't invent the spiral. He then spends 30 seconds to explain a Fibonacci Sequence to Morales. I think it's important to point out Morales has [30 years in the field](http://catherwoodtravels.blogspot.com/2013/05/meet-alfonso-morales-catherwoods.html). \n\n30:00. Ffs he brought up 2012 and the end of the world.\n\n31:00. Now they're comparing a drawing that he found that was based on a plate that was supposedly found in GA to carvings in Chichen Itza. He also mentions Columbus, who's on our bingo. And with that, we got to commercials. [Here's](http://imgur.com/2aLlLFS) our bingo card so far. \n\n34:30. They go to a cenote, and it has a layer of Maya blue at the bottom. Cut to badly filmed depiction of the \"savage\" Mayans cutting out someone's heart and throwing the body into the cenote. That's another bingo by the way. \n\n37:00. We reach another commercial screen. He just spent the last 3 minute explaining how Maya blue is made, to someone who's an expert on the Mayan peoples. I did some research, and the Mayans were able to trade all the way to Puerto Rico. This shows that the Mayans had the capacity to trade all the way to the distance of Georgia. Also, it is widely accepted that the Mayans and the cultures of the Mississippi had limited trade. An obsidian scraper in the Mayan style [was found at Spiro](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2694879?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). We have our [scorecard](http://imgur.com/TszKz84) here. \n\n37:50. They go back to his lab in Minnesota, and test the LiDAR data against the topographical data collected by Thornton. He makes a big deal about it when they are a close match, saying \"This is all really coming together,\" but all that shows is that Thornton can gather data. Just because Richard Thornton can correctly gather topographical data doesn't mean his interpretation of that data is correct, like Scott Wolter is making it out to be.  \n\n38:30. He talks about all of his so-called evidence. He mentions the word archaeoastronomy, as well as talks about the cranial deformation that no one has seen. Now, he says he's going to go test the palygorskite from GA and match it to the palygorskite found in Mexico. First, he makes Maya blue in his lab using the Anil leaf and palygorskite in the correct manner. [The culmination of his experiment.](http://imgur.com/k7V5GqU)\n\n41:45. The whole \"make Maya blue\" thing pans out to just...him making Maya blue. Instead, they go to a mineral testing lab to test palygorskite in Maya blue samples against palygorskite found in Georgia. If they have a match that will \"prove to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that the connection exists.\" According to Wikipedia it has a formula of (Mg,Al)2Si4O10(OH)·4(H2O). Maya blue has palygorskite in it, which we know already, so I can predict what's going to happen. After the mandatory 30 seconds of panning over the science stuff set to ominous music, they test and find out that the Maya blue is a match to playgorskite from Georgia. According to Mr. Wolter, now the \"bullshit academics\" can now start to rewrite history books. And roll credits. Oh yeah, he mentions 2012 one more time. [Final bingo card.](http://imgur.com/Af3EiKk)\n\n\n**Recap of \"Evidence\"**\n\n1. The Track Rock Site. There is definitely a site at Track Rock, but as discussed prior, it is open to the public, unless you are trying to dig around in it. The terracing was never proven and never discussed past the part of saying the word terracing. The only thing proved here was that Thornton's topographical data was accurate according to the LiDAR scan. Still, that proves nothing about the Mayans. \n\n2. Mayan Blue. I think this was thrown on to add a \"science don't lie\" aspect to the show. The only thing he proved was that palygorskite in Georgia was found in 1 sample of Maya blue. We already knew that they were able to trade with each other, and had limited trade. So what he's proven is again, something we already know. \n\nEDIT: /u/svatycyrilcesky has a really nice write up on this copied and pasted below.\n\nAs a (brand new) geologist, I think Scott Walter is using weasel words to make bad science seem legit.\nFirst, just a bit about x-ray diffraction: the idea behind x-ray diffraction is that you pulverize an unknown crystalline substance and then shoot x-rays at the powder. The x-rays will bounce off the atoms present, and by looking at how exactly the x-rays are diffracted you can figure out the size of the unit cell of a crystal, and then within a unit cell the size of the atoms present and their position relative to each other. You then compare the structure and composition of your mystery substance to the reference values of known substances, to see what elements are present, how they are bonding, and then by extension what compound(s) might be present in the mystery substance.\nA second point, just in geology in general - when you're comparing substances that have an overall similar composition, you generally look for things like trace elements, impurities, isotopes, etc. that would indicate a particular provenance. That's how, for example, carbon dating works - the great mass of Carbon is pretty much indistinguishable no matter how old it is, but it's the little bit of specially-preserved C-14 that can give useful information. You'd also look for relatively minor variations in the main crystal - for example, if there's two possible crystal variations which one is present, or if there are regular substitutions.\nAs for what Scott actually did, I made a transcript starting at about 40:00\nScott (to us) Did the Mayans use Georgia clay, specifically Palygorskite clay? Using indigo from añil leaves and Palygorskite clay from Georgia, I'm going to make Maya blue. If the Georgia clay in my sample matches X-Ray test results of clay used in real Maya blue, then we have a hard geological link between the Mayans and Georgia.\nScott (to scientist) Well basically what I'm trying to do is figure out if there's a match between Maya Blue in Mexico and a sample of Palygorskite from Georgia. They did find some sources in Mexico, but there's just not enough sources to explain the amount of Palygorskite that they found.\nScientist Here we've got the scan that we did. The ones labelled \"PA\" are the peaks we would expect for the Palygorskite clay structure. And these ones labelled \"QU\", these are one of the impurities present, and this is the mineral Quartz.\nScott So these are your signature elements. Now the question is, how did it compare with the actual Maya blue sample?\nScientist It actually matches almost perfectly\nSo, where are the weasel words? Let's take a look:\nScott isn't asking how does Palygorskite A compares to Palygorskite B - he's asking how Mystery Substance A (the Maya Blue sample) matches Palygorskite B. That's an important distinction - in the first case they'd calibrate the machine to a higher resolution and specifically look for particular trace elements, and then compare what they find. But that's not what they did. Scott tells us that he wants to see if Maya blue has \"Georgia clay, specifically Palygorskite clay\", which is a question about general structure and composition. The answer the scientist gives matches this question - he says that that the peaks match the Palygorskite clay structure, and that there's also some Quartz. If Scott asked the right question, they wouldn't be talking about clays and Quartz at all - they'd be talking about Vanadium and Yttrium and all those weird elements that never show up in chem problems. They didn't actually analyze the Maya Blue on-screen so I have no idea what they found. But if the scientist says that \"they match almost perfectly\" for a general composition question, the \"almost\" implies that there are trace impurities that don't match up, which implies that they are actually of a different origin. For what it's worth, in one of the papers below it seems that Mayan Palygorksite is almost completely pure while Georgian Palygorksite (which was shown on-screen) has Quartz impurities, so that makes the connection dubious.\nFor the whole show he keeps making the Palygorskite source seem like a big deal, that it must have come from Georgia, but notice that he never actually says that there isn't any in Mexico. Why? Because there's totally Palygorskite in Mexico! [http://rmcg.unam.mx/13-1/(6)de_Pablo.pdf], The Occurence of Palygorskite in the Yucatán Peninsula, Synthesis and Acid Resistence of Maya Blue, The Clays of Yucatán. These people give a nice two-page account about how you can use x-ray diffraction to analyze Palygorskite, with helpful graphs included. Here's a paper that asked the right question instead of the Scott question, and found that the Maya Blue clay from historical sites can be traced to various Yucatán mines. Hell, here's a paper from 1977 that mentions finding ancient mining tools inside of a modern Mayan clay mine (and the attapulgite it mentions is just an old name for Palygorskite). Finally, if you read any article read this - it's comprehensive and has the prettiest layout. Among other things, it mentions that the Mayan town Sacalum is just the hispanisized version of the Mayan prahse \"sac luum\", which refers specifically to Palygorskite clay, and that to this day the town mines the stuff from the bottom of a cenote, and that this mine has a bunch of Classical pottery around it.\nThis is almost a minor side point, but I really don't know why he seems to think Mexico didn't have enough Palygorskite for everybody. As I noted above Yucatecos are still collecting it today, so clearly they didn't run out. In the US Palygorksite can be found not only in Georgia but also in New Mexico, California, Washington, even Alaska - if we're investigating extensive trade routes to figure out how ancient Mayans gathered a clay that's literally in their own backyards, we might as well investigate everyone.\nIn conclusion, I think Scott Wolter's science is dubious, and that it doesn't really seem all that implausible that the Mayans just got their clay from the Yucatán. Also, thanks for making this review and the bingo cards, this was fun!\nEDIT: fixed some words and typos.\n\n3. Archaeoastronomy. He never really discusses what it is. He says the word a lot and no one really says anything about it. Then, he gets to a mound facing the sun, and because as we all know, only the Mayans did that, the Creek were Mayans. \n\n4. Petroglyphs. I did a bit more research into the plate on his show, and apparently it's part of a collection called the [Etowah plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etowah_plates). I looked them up, and found them to be the [Rogan plates](http://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/anth/?irn=8319024) of the Smithsonian. That seems to be a good reason as to why he wasn't allowed to manhandle them. The link for the Rogan plates states that it's from the 13th century and *made at Cahokia*, not Mayaland as he leads us to believe. \n\n5. Cranial Deformation. He mentions how someone heard of it and *that's it*.\n\n6. Language. Those three tribes didn't get their name from the Maya people as he said. Wolter just assumed that they did without even trying to look it up. \n\nTo conclude, this show was full of backwards logic, non-evidence, and Wolter's driving while talking on the phone skills. He proved nothing except for some evidence towards a trade link that \"bullshit academics\" were already aware of, while spending half the show complaining about a \"cover-up\". He spent more time complaining about cover-ups than he did actually solving any mystery. However, it was really funny, and I can't wait to do the next episode. Please suggest bingo ideas for episode 2, the description of which is above. Also, if you want me to do the review in a different format, just tell me how, I'm open to C&amp;C. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Threads like this will almost without fail lure in a Neo-Nazi or two, and sure enough I wasn't disappointed:  \n  \nA few minutes after the thread was posted \"friend1949\" (I'm *sure* the username is *purely* coincidental) [comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3eaw4m/eli5_why_do_nazi_sympathizers_deny_the_holocaust/ctd63jr)\n&gt; There were some positive aspects of National Socialism. Clean healthy living with exercise was emphasized. Working together for a common goal and improvement of the living standards was good.  \n  \n['dis gon b gud!](http://38.media.tumblr.com/454e34ad6cbd81cee3c82660ad84394b/tumblr_mmx9zhPBUI1qgppcuo1_400.gif)  \n  \n\nHis next paragraph is an *impressive* display of negationism:  \n&gt; It was Adolph Hitler who hated Jews, not the National Socialism movement. Hitler popularized the movement and corrupted it with his hatred of the Jews.  \n  \nWow. Woooow.  \n\nIt doesn't take a historian to see what's wrong with that statement.  \nOur \"friend\" from 1949 is apparently completely unaware of Nazism's origins. He fully ignores the fact that the oftentimes close link between German Nationalism and Antisemitism dates back almost two centuries before Hitler was even born.\n\nTake, for example,[ Johann Gottlieb Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte), one of the first Nationalist thinkers and a major influence on the Nazi ideology - he was a full-blown racist and Jew-hater. Some of his highlights include \"Addresses to the German Nation\", in which he makes the argument that making Jews free citizens would hurt the German nation and that Antisemitism is an inherently German quality.  \n\nThis was in 1808, 81 years before Hitler was even born and ~110 years before he would become relevant. *And it's not even the earliest example!* In 1793, 96 years before Hitler was born, he wrote \"Contributions to the Correction of the Public's Judgment concerning the French Revolution\" in which he calls Judaism \"a state within a state\" that could \"undermine the German nation\" and states that Jews should not be granted civil rights.  \n  \nI picked out Fichte because I'm somewhat familiar with his works (thanks, Advanced History class!) but I'm aware that there are *even earlier* examples.  \n  \nA quick look at Wikipedia gives me [Johann Gottfried von Herder](http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/05/herders-theory-of-the-volksgeist/) (1744-1803), who was one of the forerunners of Nationalism and undeniably subscribed to a racialist worldview. He referred to the Jews as *\"a parasitic growth on the stem of other nations, a race of cunning brokers all over the earth\"*, for Chrissake.  \n\nAnother one is [Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Heinrich_Riehl) (1823-1897), one of the first subscribers to the idea of Völkisch thought. He was convinced that Jews were secretly dominating the German culture.  \n  \nIt would take me months to list all examples of Nationalist thinkers before Hitler who also were antisemitic, so I'm gonna leave it at that. But rest assured, friend1949, that the National Socialism movement was corrupted with hatred of Jews long, long before Hitler came into play.  \n  \nBut wait, there's more! The rest of his comment deals less with history and more with ideology, but it's worthwhile in its own right.\n  \nHe goes on to comment that \n&gt; The strengths of National Socialism, building a strong nation of healthy individuals, did not have to include hatred of Jews. So sympathizers can like the movement but deny negative aspects.  \n  \n...yeeeah. Sure. Because cherry-picking works *so* well with ideologist movements. If you simply ignore the eight-figure body count Nazism looks *so* good all of the sudden!  \n  \nAnd finally, there's this gem:\n&gt; Nazis disliked fringe groups and minorities. They were very intolerant of them. They became enamored of a master race of pure white people so much they denied evidence that other races and minorities had strengths and could contribute to society.  \n  \n\"Intolerant\" is an interesting choice of words, here.  \n  \n---\n  \n^Edit: ^Replaced ^\"Nationalism\" ^with ^\"National ^Socialism\" ^since ^that's ^more ^accurate  \n^Edit^2: ^Added ^an ^\"oftentimes\" ^and ^re-replaced ^\"National ^Socialism\" ^with ^\"Nationalism\"",

Plus, we can't go through the whole list and verify that all of them are good, and it takes a lot of work and organization. So, instead, we decided to allow the community to discuss the books and articles that they've read/are reading in a new megathread! \n\nFind a book you like?

        "text": "This is a weird one, because I've always seen people make out that all the Founding Fathers were Christian, when they were not, and that would be the Bad History post. Some people on reddit have gone the other way however, and act like none of them were Christian. (Some of the replies do call him out on it though.)\n\n[The post in question](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3eemim/what_common_knowledge_facts_are_actually_wrong/cte7cn0)\n\n&gt;That the founding fathers were Christian. Many, in fact, were deists, a popular religious movement at the time that suggested that the world was created by a god who didn't really care about what happened in the world, and therefore didn't intervene. Some, like Thomas Jefferson, were Christian deists, a sect of Christianity that embraced Christ's moral teachings but denied his divinity and thought that God didn't really want anything to do with our world. Google the Jeffersonian Bible.\n\nI'm not sure by what way to measure who counts as a Founding Father here and who not, so it may change around a bit.\n\nFrom what I can find, of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 49 were Protestants, and two were Roman Catholics. Out of the Protestants, 28 were Anglican, eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists. I'm not sure about the 4 other people, I'm assuming a mix of Deist, Unitarian or just unknown?\n\nAlso I will point out, the people talking about Unitarians as if the Unitarians of the 18th Century are the same as modern day Unitarian Universalists. While I'm sure some are the same, Unitarian Universalists are a very open, accommodating group, Unitarians then were a much more strongly Christian influenced faith, who rejected the Trinity.\n\nWhile many of the most famous founders were Deist, Unitarian or in other ways hugely went against orthodox Christianity, or just had private religious beliefs. Those that weren't Christian still were massively influenced by it, to quote Colonial Williamsburg historian Linda Rowe [here](http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring09/deism.cfm) said, “Franklin, Washington, and Jefferson all attended church services frequently to the end of their lives. They gave money to church building funds of several denominations, and attended Baptist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, and Unitarian houses of worship. Most made no secret of their conviction that regular religious practice was necessary to public virtue upon which the survival of the republic depended.”\n\nAnyway, with the major founding fathers, Jefferson and Franklin were most likely Deists, strongly influenced by Christianity, with Jefferson flirting with Unitarianism, being friends with Joseph Priestley and attending servives while in Philadelphia. Thomas Paine was definitly a Deist. Washington and John Adams changed their religious views over time, with Washington being especially private about his views, and Adams was raised a Congregationalist but shared many views with Deists, while not necesarilly being one himself, saying about Thomas Paines' Age of Reason \"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.\".\n\nTo say that the Founding Fathers were Christian or weren't Christian are both wrong. They are a large group of people (that still Historians can't agree who is included in that) with many different religious beliefs. Let me know if I made any mistakes in this, not exactly the area of history I know most about.\n\n ",

The movie was in its last half hour when I started, so I got to hear this gem from one of the \"angel\" characters:\n\n&gt; David Norris: What ever happened to Free Will?\n\n&gt; Thompson: We actually tried Free Will before. After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire we stepped back to see how you'd do on your own. You gave us the Dark Ages for five centuries... until finally we decided we should come back in. The Chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride a bike before taking the training wheels off again. So we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution. For six hundred years we taught you to control your impulses with reason, then in 1910 we stepped back. Within fifty years, you'd brought us World War I, the Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust and capped it off by bringing the entire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban Missile Crisis. At that point a decision was taken to step back in again before you did something that even we couldn't fix. You don't have free will, David. You have the appearance of free will.\n\nHe describes the \"Dark Ages\" as lasting for 500 years, so we'll say it's the [Early Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages) he's talking about. Roughly 500-1000 CE. Rome is considered as having fallen in 476 CE when Odocaer revolted, and there's a long way between that and the Renaissance, so we had to nail it down a little bit. In fact, there's a basic problem here with math. Going back six hundred years from 1910 CE you have 1310 CE. Going back 500 years from that, you have 810 CE. The Western Roman Empire was *long* collapsed at that point. So for the sake of argument we'll assume Thompson leaves unsaid that from 1000 CE to 1310 CE they were correcting humanity's horrible dark ages mistakes. \n\nBiggest problem: The Dark Ages were only arguably dark for one specific place, Western Europe. \n\nRight next door to the Western Roman Empire you had the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire. They were thriving during the Early Middle Ages, a period which includes the following:\n\n&gt; The resolution of the Iconoclastic controversy in favor of the use of icons ushered in a second flowering of the empire, the Middle Byzantine period (843–1204). Greek became the official language of the Byzantine state and church, and Christianity spread from Constantinople throughout the Slavic lands to the north. Efforts to recover eastern territories lost to Arab armies in the seventh century, including Syria and Crete, met with some success early in the period. The Byzantine system of military governorship over themes (administrative divisions), existing from the seventh to twelfth centuries, provided administration for the state's distant and expanding territories.\n\n&gt; Art and architecture flourished during the Middle Byzantine period, owing to the empire's growing wealth and broad base of affluent patrons. Manuscript production reached an apogee (2007.286), as did works in cloisonné enamel (1997.235; 17.190.678) and stone and ivory carving (2007.9; 1970.324.3). An intensified revival of interest in classical art forms and ancient literature reflected Byzantium's continuous and active engagement with its ancient past throughout the empire's long history (17.190.239).\n\n[Byzantium (ca. 330–1453)](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/byza/hd_byza.htm)\n\nThe Early Middle Ages also saw the start of the Golden Age of Islam, particularly under the Abbassid Dynasty:\n\n&gt; “The Golden Age” was based on several factors (5) . Muslims following the guidelines of the Prophet studied and searched for knowledge (1 , 5 , 6) . The Quran is clear: “The scholar’s ink is more sacred than the blood of martyrs”, while the Prophet promoted medical research preaching that “For every disease, Allah has given a cure.” (5) Communication became easier because the Muslim Empire united extensive geographic areas. Scholars traveled to teach or share ideas. Furthermore, the Arabic language became a unifying factor (4 , 5) . Translations from Greek, Latin, and Chinese into Arabic were innumerable, thus removing language barriers for scholars. During the same period, Arabs learned from the Chinese how to produce paper and books became more available (5) . Libraries were established in Cairo, Aleppo, Baghdad, and urban centers in Iran, central Asia, and Spain, while bookshops with thousands of titles opened in several cities (4 , 5) . Finally, The House of Wisdom, an academic institution serving as a university, was established in Baghdad in 1004 C.E. (5) .\n\n[Arab science in the golden age (750–1258 C.E.) and today](http://www.fasebj.org/content/20/10/1581.full)\n\nThat's just Europe and the Near East. Never mind China with the Tang and Song dynasties, or the Nara and Heian Period in Japan, or Maya's Classical Period. While it's no surprise to anybody here that the Dark Ages weren't all they Dark, they **definitely** weren't \"mankind collapsing into chaos because angels aren't guiding him\". Even in Western Europe you had Charlemagne and the Carolingians.\n\nNext, he claims that the period from 1000-1910 was *just dandy* because we had angels at the wheel. And once they stepped back, we did terrible things like the world wars, and the Depression, and the Holocaust, and Fascism. \n\nThe Holocaust was definitely bad. Also bad: The [Congo Free State](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/18/congo.andrewosborn):\n\n&gt; Shocking claims - often well documented - that 10 million Congolese were either murdered or worked to death by Leopold's private army, that women were systematically raped, that people's hands were cut off and that the local populace endured kidnapping, looting and village burnings, have never been the subject of serious debate in Belgium, let alone brought an apology.\n\nWhen was this nightmare regime in place? 1885-1908. Good job, angels!\n\nOther examples of the \"six hundred years\" we were taught to control our impulses with reason include the Spanish conquering of South America, the Trail of Tears, the Transatlantic Slave Trade (at least 1.2 million Africans dead), the American Civil War, and the Terror of the French Revolution. Given what a mess we had just in the 19th century with free will ostensibly restrained, what could have made them think in 1910 we were ready to give it a go? \n\nCriticism of Fascism is a weird thing to see from somebody who was holding the Roman Empire up as an example of their beneficial guidance. Using the Depression as a benchmark of economic horror from somebody apparently proud of feudalism and the slave trade is also weird. And the child labor of the 19th century, the appalling factory conditions and mine conditions during the Industrial Revolution, I guess we have them to thank for that?\n\nPretty much the only valid point he'd have in there was that we had the possibility to blow up the world with nukes. Of course, never mind the abundance of other technological advances from 1910 to 1962. The use of radio for communication. Television. Jet engines. Computers. Sputnik. Yuri Gagarin, Alan Shepard, Gherman Titov, John Glenn. Blood transfusion. Sulfa antibiotics. On and on. Even though the World Wars and the Cold War had tremendous loss of human life and tremendous risk to the planet, they also spurred intense technological revolutions that built tremendously on the past. Honestly, we didn't do too bad for ourselves when we were at the helm, and the angels didn't do that great of a job either. \n\nWithin the premise of the movie, anyway. My hackles went up from the moment the character said \"You gave us the Dark Ages for five centuries\", I couldn't just let that slide. \n\n**EDIT** Since some little wanker sent me repeated direct messages insisting I was wrong to say \n\n&gt; The Dark Ages were only arguably dark for one specific place, Western Europe. \n\nAccording to him, the dark ages weren't at all dark, not in Western Europe, where everything was fine. And I should \"educate myself\" and \"Learn history\". Of course, I had not said definitively that they were or were not dark, I simply said that the argument could be made one way or the other. \n\nI said that for a reason, because of entries like this *from the Encyclopedia Britannica*:\n\n&gt; Dark Ages,\n\n&gt; The early medieval period of western European history. Specifically, the term refers to the time (476–800) when there was no Roman (or Holy Roman) emperor in the West; or, more generally, to the period between about 500 and 1000, **which was marked by frequent warfare and a virtual disappearance of urban life**. It is now rarely used by historians because of the value judgment it implies. Though sometimes taken to derive its meaning from the fact that little was then known about the period, the term’s more usual and pejorative sense is of a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity. See Middle Ages.\n\n[Dark Ages](http://www.britannica.com/event/Dark-Ages)\n\nHe wouldn't lay off and I have better things to do with my time so I blocked him. From his comment history, nothing of value was lost.",

They're built to last hundreds of years, not tens. Is there a reason that US houses for example are seemingly not brick built in many places, and opt for a cladding type material? I remember seeing a ton of posts about people having to reclad their houses after hurricanes. Surely if they were brick built from the begining, this wouldn't be needed.\n\n&gt;Even roof tiles. It's very rare to ever need to touch them on British style houses, yet, again, there seems to be a lot of American style house builds that use really thin tiling that damages way easier than it should.\n\n&gt;I get that a lot of housing needs to be put up quickly, but in big neighbourhoods why are they not built to last?\n\nFixed formatting\n\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/3e2nfc/history_of_american_homes/ctbfedz\n\nNever mind that this is untrue (Sweden, Finland, and Estonia are full of wooden houses and Austria is working on a wooden skyscraper), but even for, say, England the cause of the decline had nothing to do with structural quality and everything to do with unsustainable forestry. By the 1600s, England was so deforested from charcoal and shipbuilding that it was importing wood from the Baltic countries; there wasn't much left for the famous half-timbered homes of the Tudor period. Wood frame became a rarity.\n\n[According to this book (warning: PDF) deforestation in England killed off heavy wooden houses starting in the 1600s. At the same time, brick-making technology was improving. It is only now, with better stewardship, international trade, and environmental concern, that wood frame is again feasible in the UK.]( https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.dhow.co.uk/eva.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0CBgQFjAFahUKEwivjYCU8fHGAhXCHB4KHR5KAUw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqcCmYT2P84ta5uDqwYAW1h6yjfA)",

Don't stop at this comment, though, because the whole thing is *amazing*.\n\n&gt; I don't ignore his sins. People think Hitler was behind the POW camps. He had almost nothing to do with the camps. That was under the power of Himmler. Hitler may have supplied the doctrine, but he was focused on war in Europe, not criminals in POW camps.\n\n&gt; And most of the sins of the NSDAP were made up and sensationalized by Western media.\n\n&gt; Stories like how jews were raised by wolves and geysers of blood and dogs trained to attack jews who didn't play the right notes and lampshades made of human skin and evil doctors experimenting on people and gas chambers that never existed or were built after the war by the USSR or extermination camps. All lies. Camps are common in time of war. They are called POWs.\n\n&gt; The only sins during the war belong to the West. Eisenhower ran the only true death camps that killed Germans, not jews or fags or w/e envokes public outrage for the cause. They were the ones who violated POW law during wartime by reclassifying captured Germans so they could starve them and be internationally free of guilt.\n\nOh God, where to begin?\n\nA POW or Prisoner Of War camp is, as this posted claims, a normal and expected part of warfare, but *concentration camps* are something different and *death camps* are yet a whole different thing. (They're not called \"POWs\" though, that's the actual prisoners). That said, WW2 German POW camps really *were* something... special, particularly for prisoners of the Slavic persuasion.\n\nHowever, when most of us think about Nazi atrocities, it's usually the concentration camps and death camps we think about. The victims of these weren't prisoners of war at all, but German and foreign civilians who, through being born of the wrong ethnicity or sexual preference or just having different politics to the Nazis, somehow committed an unforgivable sin with the result that they were overworked, underfed and generally mistreated *to death* or shipped off to literal murder factories.\n\nAnother claim is that the US (through the offices of Gen. Eisenhower) ran \"true\" death camps for Germans. Yes, the US ran POW camps for German prisoners of war and DP camps for displaced persons, but neither of these remotely qualifies as a \"death camp.\" I hate to relativize suffering but... compared to the conditions the Germans kept *their* prisoners of war in, the US camps were downright cushy. Most of the population of DP camps would have been people displaced by the German war and genocide efforts, including former concentration camp inmates, and the Allies in general did their best to make their *temporary* accommodations livable until they could be reunited with their loved ones (if any survived).\n\nTL;DR Bog standard Holocaust denialism with a side of comical ignorance. \n\n\nI'll give /r/conspiracy credit for (moderately) downvoting the worst posts but when this crap shows up in your sub on a regular basis I think you need to address the elephant in the room, am I right?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: And before anyone else says it: THIS AIN'T NO FRUIT, THIS IS A GODDAMN TATER\n",

It stated that women found guilty of seducing men by a cosmetic product could be tried for witchcraft.'\n\nThe problem is that Witchcraft was not punishable under the law anymore in Britain by 1770.  A Witchcraft Act had been passed under James I in 1604, which made witchcraft and communication with familiar spirits punishable by death:\n\n'In 1604, the year following James' accession to the English throne, the Elizabethan Act was broadened to bring the penalty of death without benefit of clergy to any one who invoked evil spirits or communed with familiar spirits.'\n\nHowever, by 1735, the Witchcraft Act was repealed, and changed to reflect the growing attitude that witchcraft was no longer a scientific possibility.  The new Act specifically targeted fraudulent claims:\n\n'A person who claimed to have the power to call up spirits, or foretell the future, or cast spells, or discover the whereabouts of stolen goods, was to be punished as a vagrant and a con artist, subject to fines and imprisonment.'\n\nSo I highly doubt that women were being tried and hanged on accusations of witchcraft in Britain during the 1770s for wearing lipstick.  In Britain, the 1735 Act was in full force.  It would take slightly longer to take effect in America; in the 1770s, Thomas Jefferson passed an Act modeled on the 1735 Act in use in Great Britain, which attacked fraudulent claims of magic and mediumship.",

Complaining that people don't hear enough about it is ludicrous; right up there with saying the bombing of Pearl Harbor doesn't get enough play.\n\n&gt;Indeed, Sherman's March was the first use of an Industrial Era army against a civilian population\n\nHorseshit. In what way was Sherman's army \"industrial?\" He had cut loose from their supply lines and determined that his fifty thousand infantrymen would march across Georgia whilst living off the land, simultaneously feeding his army while weakening the rebel homeland. This is classic, traditional campaigning, as familiar to Caesar as to William the Conqueror as to Gustavus Adolphus as to Napoleon. Refusing to target civilians for forage and trucking/shipping/railing in supplies is by far the more modern behavior.\n\n&gt;one not surpassed until the genocidal regimes of the 20th century\n\nThis is not only blatantly wrong, but it is offensive on several levels. The number of civilians killed - outright murdered - by Sherman's army was vanishingly small. A few dozen or hundred at best. His aim was not to kill civilians, but to wreck war industry and infrastructure and to generally collapse the southern economy by liberal foraging. It is mind-boggling that someone would compare the targeted mass killing of Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, et al to Sherman's actions in Georgia and South Carolina. It is a slap in the face to the millions of victims of these 20th century murderous regimes.",

        "text": "I was looking for the title to a particular article about Roman immigration, and so I entered \"immigration ancient Roman\" into Google and unfortunately did not find the article I was looking for. I did, however, fin quite a few articles I was *not* looking for about how immigrants destroyed the Roman Empire. I'm going to focus on one particular strand: people who apparently think this is what Peter Heather's books *Empires and Barbarians* and *The Fall of the Roman Empire*. Examples:\n\n[From the John Birch Society](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+immigration+destroyed+Rome.+Oxford+historian+Peter+Heather+has...-a0141907543)\n\n[From Brussel's Journal](http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/3851)\n\n[From Pat Buchanan](http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/08/25/buchanan-likened-illegal-immigrants-to-goths-wh/136479)\n\nTo give some flavors, from the first link:\n\n&gt;There are two major lessons to be learned from the fall of the Roman Empire in the West, and these are made apparent in Heather's book. First and foremost is the danger of uncontrolled hostile immigration. That the empire could absorb large groups of immigrants is beyond doubt. It could and did do so over several centuries. But even the Roman Empire, with its vast territory and unprecedented wealth, had a limit to the number of people it could absorb and Romanize. Eventually, the immigrants grew more powerful than the existing Roman authority and, maintaining to some degree their independence of spirit and character, were unwilling to relinquish their own culture and adopt the Roman.\n\nFrom the second:\n\n&gt;Heather upholds the immigration-theory of the Empire’s disintegration. When Heather’s book appeared, indeed, a number of conservative commentators remarked it, calling admonitory attention to its author’s thesis that a kind of illegal immigration, or technically legal immigration by culturally inassimilable people, played a major role in killing off the largest, longest-lived, most functionally universal polity that ever existed.\n\nFrom the third:\n\n&gt;\"In 376 a large band of Gothic refugees arrived at the Empire's Danube frontier, asking for asylum. In a complete break with established Roman policy, they were allowed in, unsubdued. They revolted, and within two years had defeated and killed the emperor Valens -- the one who had received them -- along with two-thirds of his army, at the battle of Hadrianople.\"\n\n\nNow just as a bit of corrective, Peter Heather himself [wrote a short review article](http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/40538) for History News Network, so let's see how *he* describes this flood of illegal immigration:\n\n&gt;By 440, their different original components – more than half a dozen in total - had coalesced into two major groupings, each much larger than any of the groups which had existed beyond the frontier in the fourth century: the Visigoths in southern Gaul, the Vandals in North Africa, both representing amalgamations of three separate immigrant groups of 10,000 warriors plus.  The immigrants had in the process inflicted great damage on west Roman state structures, by first mincing its armies and then preventing their proper replacement either by ravaging or annexing key areas of its tax base.  This in turn allowed Anglo-Saxons and Franks to take over former Roman territories in Britain and north-eastern Gaul, weakening the state still further.  The immigrants also acted as alternative sources of political magnetism for local Roman elites. \n\nNow I grant that things may be different in California and Arizona, but at least in Georgia immigrants are not represented by armies of over 10,000 who routinely defeat the US army in military engagements. They have also, as far as I know, yet to carve out autonomous polities in New Mexico and the strangle the US tax base. However I do admit they may be talking about Europe, so if any Scandinavian Redditors can let us know if refugees have started forming into warbands to conquer towns and ravage the countryside that would be really helpful!\n\nFrom a broader perspective, these tend to badly misunderstand the events leading up to the Battle of Adrianople. Broadly speaking, pressure from the central Eurasian steppe set off a chain reaction that eventually drove the Goths to seek entrance into the borders of the empire. This was, itself, a fairly common state of affairs: way back in the first century the overnor Plautius Silvanus claimed to have settled 100,000 people from across the Danube into Roman territory. The Goths were a bit different in that they aspired to remain more cohesive and organized but still, this \"immigration\" had been going on since the beginning.\n\nSo what changed? Well, when the Goths tried to enter the empire the local magistrates were *complete douchebags*. They cut off the supply of grain and demanded extraordinary payments, even in the form of slaves. The Goths reached a breaking point and revolted, not because they were ungrateful welfare queens, but because the Romans did not uphold their end of the bargain.\n\nAnd finally, all these claims of unassimilated immigrants ignores the fact that the Germanic kingdoms all tried very hard to be like Roman states, by building monuments, holding triumphs an patronizing literature. They eventually outran their taxing capabilities and turned into Medieval states, but this was not for lack of trying.\n\nSo long story short, until the Guatemalan immigrants defeat the US military in the field this comparison is *really* not going to work.\n\nNaturally, see Heather's work to see what he actually said, rather than what silly people think he said.",

        "text": "My university's student magazine is abysmal.  Usually it is just the inherent classism which annoys me (like, literally in an article about sexism/slut shaming containing jokes about how if you visit working class areas you will get S.T.Is just by walking around, like, no self awareness, it is amazing), but today it was the use of badhistory to match an agenda.  To be fair, this is probably one of my more pedantic criticisms of the magazine.  That being said, fuck 'em.  If you are going to use history to support your arguments then please do so without bending, presenting or omitting information to suit your agenda.  The article is called *Refugees, Why are we Failling?* by Gemma Forlong. \n\nThe quote:\n\n&gt;John McGlashan, a Scottish immigrant who ended up in Dunedin once said:  'If your prospects are bad...then I can safely say you would be ten times better off in New Zealand, where, if you are able to keep yourself sober, you would in a little time be surrounded with abundance of bacon and eggs, bread, butter, milk and cream, puddings, fowls, and all kinds of vegetables.'  This was in 1848.  Even then, New Zealand was seen as a sweet place to live, and this is further evidenced by the huge number of immigrants who have come to New Zealand and settled permanently since.\"\n\n...\n\n&gt;John McGlashan once said\n\nFirst of all, I am not 100% sure that it was John McGlashan who said this.  Of course the article has no reference, but the only other mention of this quote I can find is in *New Zealand and its Six Colonies Historically and Geographically Described* a book written in 1853, and published by Craddock and Co. London.  This book seems to attribute the quote to a Mr. Ward, who I think is a Mr. J. Ward of Nelson who I know nothing about.\n\n&gt;In 1848 New Zealand was seen as a sweet place to live\n\nFurthermore, even if McGlashan did say this it isn't evidence that New Zealand was thought of as a good place to live in 1848.  Firstly; John McGlashan had not been (to the best of my knowledge) to New Zealand in 1848.  He may have visited, but he did not emigrate until 1853.  So why would he be saying something like this?  From Te Ara, the Encyclopedia of New Zealand:\n\n&gt;Because of his rejection of an established church and because he believed that the church should embrace the whole community, McGlashan became interested in the proposal for settlement in Otago. He saw in it the possibility of a finer Scotland, embodying the best British and Christian values. Appointed secretary of the Otago Association at £300 a year in 1847, he worked compulsively, if not always effectively, for the success of the colony. He oversaw the arrangements for the dispatch of 12 of the first 14 ships, and edited the Otago Journal from January 1848 to August 1852, setting out the advantages of emigration but saying little about the hardships. He lobbied the Colonial Office vigorously, but with only partial success, to safeguard the interests of Otago in the proposed constitution. Clause 78 of the Constitution Act 1852, designed to provide this safeguard, was substantially his work.\n\nThis Te Ara article already calls out McGlashan's bias.  Literallt the first place I look when I want to talk about a figure in New Zealand History (followed by the print Encyclopedia of New Zealand).  John McGlashan was employed by the people setting up the colony of Dunedin/Otago.  Not just any colony, though, a colony for members of the Scottish Free Church, a south seas theocracy, from *Being Scottish in an Irish Catholic Church in a Scottish Presbyterian Settlement*:\n\n&gt;The schism of the Scottish Presbyterian Church in 1843, which witnessed the formation of a new ‘Free Church’ Presbyterian body, coincided neatly with the promotion of this scheme. Rennie and Wakefield saw value in a core religious identity as a binding element in the proposed settlement and courted the new organisation to take a major role in the planned settlement. The Free Church was only interested, however, if the colonisation scheme was exclusive to its adherents. They sought a Free Church theocracy in the South Seas, hence when Revd Thomas Burns was appointed as Minister to the proposed colony he set out to redefine the proposal on this narrower basis. This put Burns on a collision course with Rennie, who was unwilling to sacrifice his broader vision of a Scots community in New Zealand to promote the interests of the new sect...\n\n&gt;Yet the Free Church’s enthusiasm for Otago proved more notional than had been hoped for; it offered no money and little practical assistance to the scheme. It was left to a Lay Committee of the Church to beat the drum for Otago, virtually a one-man band in the person of Edinburgh lawyer John McGlashan.\n\nIn 1848, from the same source as above, McGlashan was in Scotland pushing the colony, while William Cargill and Thomas Burns went to New Zealand to begin establishing the community.  Of course somebody whose occupation was to set up a New Zealand colony was praiseworthy of New Zealand as a place to live.  Furthermore, because of their intense attention to the Free Church the Otago colony struggled to attract members, so there was an even greater need to advertise for new members.\n\n&gt;further evidenced by the huge numbers of immigrants who have come to NZ since\n\nNow this is just frustrating.  It is a dated analysis, and shows poor understanding of New Zealand history.  Unfortunately I don't have my Lyndon Fraser or Angela McCarthy books on hand, but I will just summarise for now, then source things when I get home (I hope that is OK!).  My area of expertise is New Zealand Catholics, so while I know this is almost certainly true for Irish settlers there some may be some minor differences between Scottish and English settlers, however, these would be in examples not in concepts and I will be mostly dealing with concepts.\n\nThe first important thing to remember is that migration does not just happen because the target destination is a \"sweet place to live.\"  Recent historiography, particularly on the Irish diaspora, has shown the importance of investigating not just the destination, but also the place they left from.  It also shows that migration was a large network, not just people moving from one place to another.  A specific example of this is Fredrick Burwell, an architect who moved from Scotland to Queenstown, New Zealand in the early 1870s.  By 1878 he was in Invercargill, New Zealand, and by the 1880s he was in Australia.  Burwell didn't move around a lot because he thought places would be 'sweet to live' he moved to places because there was work there, and he could make a living.  If he thought there was better/more work elsewhere he would have (and did) go elsewhere.  Queenstown, for example, was a gold mining town, and by the 1870s the gold rush in New Zealand was over, so there wasn't as much money in Queenstown.  Agriculture was growing by this point, however, as there were larger numbers of settlers and more land had been converted for European farming techniques, so a town like Invercargill (a large rural centre) would have been a much better place to be for an architect.\n\nThe second point to remember is that immigration to NZ was very much 'wave-oriented.'  Migrants would come in large groups motivated by specific events in NZ.  One such event was the gold-rush, gold-rush migrants certainly weren't coming to NZ because it was a sweet place to live, as many were coming from goldfields in Australia and America.  Again, they were migrating for professional reasons.  Other events would be events which were specifically designed to attract immigrants, such as Julius Vogel's immigration schemes, which were involved with a large public works scheme to improve the NZ economy.  In this later example you could argue they are moving there because it is 'pretty sweet.'  But the reason they thought this was because of a concentrated, state-funded advertisement scheme designed to attract as many people as possible.\n\nIf migrants weren't coming in waves it was usually because they were involved in 'chains of migration.'  That is to say, they were nominated by friends and family in NZ to come join their family in the colony.  Again, these migrants did not come because they thought NZ was 'pretty sweet' they came because they had an opportunity to come to NZ.  It was more that they didn't think Ireland/Scotland/England was particularly good, and it would be easier to get to NZ than Canada or Australia or America.  They wanted a new life, and because they knew people in NZ it became their best chance for a new life that was better than the old.  Describing this by merely saying they thought New Zealand was good is horribly lacking in nuance.\n\nI don't really want to go into the comparison between 21st century refugees, and 19th century colonial settlers, as I think this would probably step on R2?\n\nSources:\n\n&gt;  *New Zealand and its Six Colonies Historically and Geographically Described* 1853: accessed at Early New Zealand Books, Auckland University\n\n&gt;  Brosnahan, Seán. \"Being Scottish in an Irish Catholic Church in a Scottish Presbyterian Settlement: Otago's Scottish Catholics, 1848–1895.\" *Immigrants &amp; Minorities: Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora* 30, no. 1 (2012): 22-42.\n\n&gt;  Ian Breward.

        "text": "EDIT: We did it reddit? I pmed the mods and I think they removed it. it's at least labeled as misleading so I'm satisfied.\n\n[Honestly I don't know why I read this crap anymore.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3dv0q4/til_robert_e_lee_the_general_of_the_confederate/)\n\nThe title proudly proclaims;\n&gt; TIL Robert E Lee, the General of the Confederate Army, was anti-slavery and wanted to keep the Union intact but was very loyal to his home state of Virginia and choose to fight with the Confederacy because that is where Virginia aligned.\n\nNow, this is a crock of shit. Like one thing in this title is true. And it sits at a humble 1197 upvotes right now. I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH KARMA PUT TOGETHER. Sometimes I think I should just post pro-nazi, pro-confederate crap all over TIL so that I can have bucketloads of karma.\n\nI'll give you the fact that people in the comments are all calling his shit out, but why do a thousand people agree with him? I don't know how I get angry at this stuff anymore.\n\nAnyway, here's your R5, not that any of us need it anymore:\n\nLee was about as anti-slavery as the [rest of the Confederacy](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mbgl0/what_historical_figure_has_the_most_undeserved/cc96uwc) (Which he fought to protect. Just a side note).\n\nWe see this in a letter he wrote to his wife, which is often cherry-picked in order to call General Lee anti-slavery.\n\n&gt; ...In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral &amp; political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, &amp; while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially &amp; physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, &amp; I hope will prepare &amp; lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known &amp; ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.\n\nAh, the classic \"White Man's Burden\"! Don't see that one very often, do we?\n\nThere's also the fact that when Lee's father in law died, he inherited a few hundred slaves, which were to be freed in a manner seen to be \"most expedient and proper\" in no more than five years. Lee, ever anti-slavery, decided to take a two-year leave from soldiering to run the plantation when he could find no one else to do so. In his time there, three slaves escaped but were captured and forced to return. The *New York Daily Tribune* claimed (based off of two anonymous letters) that Lee had them whipped, and when the overseer refused to whip the woman in the group Lee decided to execute the task himself and whipped her. If you want to read the whole story, you can just click on the TIL link. Handy!\n\nAnyway, back to the rest of the slaves. Thanks to /u/nonhomogenized for helping me out here. My memory was kind of sketchy and I didn't want to look up \"General Lee's Slaves\" for multiple reasons. [Here's his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3dwc2c/hey_look_guys_til_is_ready_to_have_a_completely/ct9f686) (give him an upvote!):\n\n&gt; Robert E Lee was the executor of his father-in-law's will (his father-in-law, George Washington Parke Custis died October 10, 1857). As you mentioned, it contained a clause to the effect that the slaves (which were in the name of Lee's wife, Mary Custis Lee) would have to be freed within 5 years. Lee tried to file a lawsuit to allow them to keep the slaves longer, but lost. Before the 5 years were over, however, the Civil War intervened in 1861, and Lee went off to join the Confederacy.\nAnd Lee didn't end up officially freeing those slaves until December 29, 1862... just over the original 5 year mark, and only 3 days before the deadline Lincoln had given in his September 22, 1862 announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation (which was to take effect January 1, 1863). In fact, Robert E Lee's actual \"emancipation proclamation\" was dated January 2, 1863.\n\nAlso there's this handy little guy:\n\n&gt; However, despite his stated opinions, Lee's troops under his command were allowed to actively raid settlements during major operations like the 1863 invasion of Pennsylvania to freely capture Free Blacks for enslavement.\n\nI got like half of this from the article that the TIL linked to. Can we not try harder to praise a man who fought for the institution of slavery?",

It was an English class but where it happened is more important, keep that in mind.\n\n\nSo we have a test about Irish history, which means we are given a source text and have to answer to a few tasks. The source was about &lt;Peace Lines&gt; in Belfast. Basically, these are walls between catholic and protestant neighbourhoods to prevent violence (&lt;The Troubles&gt;). First built in 1969, they have been extended to the 2000s, and just recently there was resolution to remove all of them 'til 2023.\n\n\nBack to the test: The source compared those Peace Lines to the Berlin Wall as they restrict freedom of movement and we were asked to comment on this comparison. Let's ignore that point but what has been really bad history was the answer of a student in my class. She stated, without batting an eye, that the *Berlin Wall was built by Hitler to shield from the Jews.*\n\n\nAfter the second world war, lead by Hitler, Germany was occupied by the US, Great Britain, France and Russia. While the first three basically pooled together, Russia did it's own thing an tried to build a pseudo socialism in Eastern Germany (&lt;DDR&gt;) from 1949. Berlin was in the Eastern area, but part of it belonged to Western Germany. In 1961, Eastern Germany built a 100 mile-wall around the Western part of Berlin and guarded it without mercy, killing everyone who tried to pass. In 1989, the wall fell, enabling German reunion in 1990.\n\n\nNote that Nazi-Germany and post-war Germany are the best known parts of German history. Stating this is like saying Abraham Lincoln was a leading fighter in the war of independence.",

        "text": "Come one, come all, to the Circus of Bad History! Bottles at the ready, gang, we're in for a bumpy ride...\n\nIt's been a rough day for Her Maj, after that bastion of high quality press, *The Sun*, printed an incriminating video showing her, aged 6 or 7, giving a Nazi salute with her Uncle, Prince Edward (Edward VIII), a known Nazi sympathiser.\n\nNaturally, there's been a lot of debate as to whether this was appropriate and there's a UK based left wing blogger who I follow on Facebook called 'Another Angry Voice' who pitched their hat into the ring with [this post](https://www.facebook.com/185180654855189/photos/a.389966974376555.89655.185180654855189/1012804138759499/?type=1), making the perfectly valid point that it's probably a bit rich to criticise someone for things they did when they were 6 and an adult told them to do it.\n\nHowever, that is not the Bad History/Bad Linguistics we're here to criticise. Instead, it comes from this steaming pile of crap found in the comments, which I shall reproduce in full so you may all bask in its glory:\n\n&gt;We have to understand exactly what was / is meant by the term \"nazi\". The word Nazi (from Hebrew Nasi meaning “Knight”) came to be used in 1933, as the 'official' new name of 'The National Socialist German Workers Party' (The Nazi Party). The word (Nazi or Nasi), dates back to the time of the Sanhedrin councils of Palestine, first formed by the Romans in the 1st Century BCE. To members of modern Judaism, the Nasi were the appointed spiritual leaders of the Sanhedrin of the office of Nasi and the bloodline of the Rabbinical Scholars of the House of Hillel.\n\n&gt;The Nazi SS also known as \"SS\" is a shortened name for the \"Knights of the Holy See\" and is/was a Roman Catholic spiritual and military order first formed in 1933. It was based completely upon the Jesuit order structure, upon the signing of the \"sacred\" Reich Concordat between Franz von Papen (on behalf of Nazi Germany) and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII). - Interesting when you connect the dots to the British (and other European) Royals, isn't it....\n\n... wut?\n\nBut, seriously. What? What did I just read?\n\nTaking it point by point:\n\n&gt;We have to understand exactly what was / is meant by the term \"nazi\". The word Nazi (from Hebrew Nasi meaning “Knight”) came to be used in 1933, as the 'official' new name of 'The National Socialist German Workers Party' (The Nazi Party).\n\nNope. The word 'Nazi' is formed by ~~a contraction of the German '**Na**tional So**zi**alistisch' (National Socialist)~~ **(nope, I am wrong and I should have noticed this sooner with my degree in German)** the fact that 'National', when pronounced with a German accent, is 'Nat-see-on-aal'. Drop the last two syllable and, voila, Nazi.\n\n&gt;The word (Nazi or Nasi), dates back to the time of the Sanhedrin councils of Palestine, first formed by the Romans in the 1st Century BCE. To members of modern Judaism, the Nasi were the appointed spiritual leaders of the Sanhedrin of the office of Nasi and the bloodline of the Rabbinical Scholars of the House of Hillel.\n\nAlso nope. The word nasi appears in the Masoeretic text of the Hebrew Bible (132 times, no less), with the Aleppo Codex dating back to 10th Century BCE, a good 4 centuries before the Roman Republic was even founded! The Romans did not found the Sanhedrin Councils, though they did recognise the Nasi as Patriach of the Jews and required Jews to pay taxes for upkeep of that office.\n\nBut somehow, it gets worse!\n\n&gt;The Nazi SS also known as \"SS\" is a shortened name for the \"Knights of the Holy See\" and is/was a Roman Catholic spiritual and military order first formed in 1933.\n\nThis is so unbelievably counter-factual, I genuinely wonder whether this is an elaborate troll but I've seen people say weirder shit before in earnest, so I'm taking this at face value.\n\nSS is an acronym for *Schutzstaffel*, literal translation *Protection Squadron*. It has nothing to do with *Knights of the Holy See*. The only reference I could find to link them came from the totally legit [one-evil.org](http://one-evil.org/content/entities_organizations_nazi_ss.html) and this entire paragraph appears to have been directly copied and pasted from there. Apart from this lovely rejoinder:\n\n&gt;Interesting when you connect the dots to the British (and other European) Royals, isn't it....\n\nIs it? Look, we all know Edward VIII was a Nazi sympathiser who had to be shipped off the Caribbean so he wouldn't do anything embarrassing, but it seems a bit far to start blaming all the European Royals for National Socialism. Especially when you consider that Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom (all European Monarchies) all fought against the Nazis (although, we should note that Leopold III of Belgium had a dodgy relationship with the Nazis).\n\nN.b. After a little more digging, it turns out this entire post was copied directly from one-evil.org, which appears to be a [very silly place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Npo0cmp-VY) indeed.\n\nEDIT: I think my title is probably a touch misleading - I'm not sure if this is really 'Anti-Semitic'. It's definitely anti-Catholic and the undercurrent of 'ooh look at this connection between Judaism and Nazism' could be seen as one step from 'DAE HOLOHOAX' but might not be enough for 'Anti-Semitic'.\n",

        "text": "Yay! I finally found the blog post everyone seems to be drinking, so I can call out this particular bit of annoying bad history! \n\nI’ve heard an egregious number of people over the years say that the mytho-historical female soldier, Hua Mulan, was executed for treason or the like at the end of her story. I’m not claiming be-all end-all expertise here, but I’m claiming the ability to open JSTOR and read, as well as do a simple Google search.\n\nThe post in question comes from [this blog](http://www.janelcomeau.ca/2014/02/overanalyzing-disney-why-mulan-did.html) and here’s the quote that’s making me sadder than that one answer on Ask.com that just said, “Sorry to burst your bubble, but Mulan is beheaded at the end.”\n\n&gt;The movie never comes right out and says it - because there's no G-rated way of telling three-year-olds that the only reward for female heroism is death by having your head sawed off - but when Mulan's deception is finally revealed (sixteen-year-old spoiler alert), the movie does show us what would have been Mulan's execution scene. In some versions of the Hua Mulan legend, that really is how her story ends; she gives the army twelve years of excellent service and gets beheaded by a commanding officer for her troubles. \n\nOkay, well, here goes nothing.\n\nFrom a paper [(here)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2659214\n) on Asian womanhood:\n\n&gt;Returning to her amazed and grateful parents and siblings, Mulan sits on her\nbed, casts aside her soldier's cloak, dons her old dress, binds her hair, fastens her\ncombs, and goes out to the road to confront her former soldier friends in her true\nsexual persona. They are astonished that she has fooled them so completely. The ballad\nends there with two lines about a male and a female hare running as fast as they can\ngo. At such a moment, the poet suggests, neither can see clearly whether the other is\nmale or female-just as soldiers fighting a war will be oblivious to such fine\ndistinctions while they are bent on saving their lives.\n\nAyyyy! The author notes some connotations of filial piety and femininity added later by Xu Wei, the playwright, but no beheading here! Hmph. Moving on!\n\nFrom another [paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/312812\n) on female warriors:\n\n&gt;She battles as a man, with none suspecting her sex,\nfor twelve years before finally returning home and resuming her\nfemale life. On hearing of this remarkable occurrence the Emperor\nrequested that she join his palace, but Mulan refused and committed\nsuicide rather than obey his command. From this simple tale of filial\ndevotion and courage many different versions have developed. An\nearly folk poem, written 1,500 years ago, titled 'Mulan shi' narrates\nher feats in verse and ends with the question: 'When a pair of rabbits\nromp together how can one know if they are male or female?'\n\nAnother version of the myth, another version of her ~~ahem~~ *not getting beheaded*. Unless I’m missing something huge here, I’m still not drinking the blog-post Kool-Aid.\n\nAnd hey, another [paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/189364Page\n), which summarizes a later screenplay by Ouyang Yuqian!\n\n&gt; After defeating the enemy, Mulan returns to the capital triumphantly.\nShe refuses all the Emperor's rewards but requests instead a steed\nto carry her home. In the final scene, she surprises Liu Yuandu,\nwith whom she has secretly fallen in love, by revealing her true\nidentity as a young maiden. The couple then marries and lives\nhappily ever after. \n\nAnd if you can’t JSTOR, here’s a good [blog post](https://dettoldisney.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/mulan-vs-the-legend-of-hua-mulan/)\n with publicly accessible sources! \n\n**Tl;dr:** It would certainly appear that the popular version of the myth, as well as the most frequently cited plays and such based on it, gives our Mulan a storied twelve-year military career with no beheading, and then a nice happy ending or, well, suicide. \n\nConveniently enough, the offensive blog post had no sources listed for anything; citing “some versions” of a ballad is like citing \"some versions\" of the Aphrodite myth. The \"some\" doesn't remove the testicles from it. (Oh, God, that was a bad joke. Thanks, Hesiod.) I'm not normally one to call anyone out on this type of Disney idiocy, but the implications of this one were too annoying--I'd like to see scholarly sources backing up the beheading bit, because otherwise it's just a bunch of ~~meaners~~ people trying to sell this to fans of the Disney version. \n\nColleagues, I leave you with the [Wikiped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Mulan):\n\n&gt;Hua Mulan or Fa Mulan is a legendary woman warrior from the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589) of China who was originally described in a ballad known as the Ballad of Mulan. In the ballad, Hua Mulan takes her aged father's place in the army. She fought for twelve years and gained high merit, but she refused any reward and retired to her hometown instead.\n\nLike, even Wikiped says she fought for twelve years and then retired to her knitting. Get it together, #meninism. Sorry for the low-effort R5ing, but it's late and I'm not caught up on my stories.\n\nEdit: English.",

[Even though, y'know, zero as a concept was around 2000 years before Christ and seems to have been promulgated by Islamic mathematicians in the 8th century.](http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/about/zero.jsp)\n\nFor extra irony, this comment goes to a Lutheran, who's probably just dying to defend the ancient or renaissance Catholic Church and everything they ever did. When called out on their badhistory, OP goes \"Jokes on them, I was only pretending to be stupid.\"\n\n**EDIT:** So, I apparently needed more exposition of good history and what the Catholic Church actually thought of zero. Copied from one of my comments below:\n\nThe Church really didn't interact with zero much if at all. At best, I can find a few people saying Catholic mathematicians were upset about zero because it was a \"Muslim idea\" or \"unbiblical\", but nothing about this turning into heresy trials or the death penalty. It seems like one of the few sources about it is Christopher Hitchens' God is Not Great, which isn't really a historical work.\n\nA quick Google search provides one link to a Catholic forum discussing it, another to something called \"Vedic Science\" that supports the whole \"zero is heretical\" notion (although, it's pretty clearly biased to praise Hindu mathematicians and shame Christians), and the Wikipedia article about the Catholic Church and science that has no instances of the word \"zero\".\n\nWe know that at least by the time of Aquinas zero and nothingness became a key part of Western mathematics. I'm really having a hard time finding anything about the Catholic Church opposing the number zero.\n",

While the students were setting up, I surveyed the room that I was in and the posters that decorated its walls. Suddenly it seemed as if I had returned to a John Wayne movie or a schoolhouse of a hundred years ago.\n\n&gt; Indians live in tipis\n\nThis was the first badhistory I noticed on a poster. For one, most people say Native American now so it was a bit odd that it said Indian. Secondly, that is only somewhat true. As I suspect many of you know (and I learned in elementary school) some Native Americans did in fact live in tipis. That is totally correct and uncontroversial. However, many of them did not. Tipis were primarily used by the tribes on the Great Plains. Native populations in other areas used different housing that matched their climate and needs. For example, Native Americans in my own beloved Pacific Northwest built plank houses such as [these](http://imgur.com/a/xwo30). The Southwest has examples such as [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/DOoj0YR/new) (again, clearly not a tipi). I'm sure someone more knowledgeable could give even more information of the diversity of Native American housing. \n\nThey were diverse because different tribes had different needs, and most importantly, because Native Americans were not a single homogeneous group. There was tons of diversity in every facet. \n\nNow onto something that is honestly just sorta silly.\n\n&gt; Indians used bows and arrows and Americans used guns.\n\nYes. That is also sometimes true. Native Americans did use [bows and arrows](http://jgrey12.imgur.com/all/) and Americans did in fact use [guns](http://imgur.com/gallery/leYslGy/new). However, Native Americans also used guns. In fact\n\n&gt; Almost from the first point of contact between Europeans and Indians,\nIndians have had guns. \n\n[Source](http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2012/06/Riley.pdf)\n\nNative Americans weren't stupid. They quickly adapted to the introduction of firearms and used them themselves. Even John Wayne movies get this stuff right. In fact, Custer would probably have something to say about Native Americans not having guns (well, he would if those guns hadn't killed him). \n\nI never dealt with these sorts of things in high school. Don't get me wrong. There was plenty of bad history, but nothing like this. This is just so outdated and silly. Its ridiculous that it is hanging in a school in the 21st century.  ",

You're all welcome to dissect that though. Okay, lets just look at some choice bit because this entire thing makes me upset.\n\n&gt;One is that back then American was completely **undiscovered and undeveloped**.

The artist says he\n\n&gt;did not follow the current and unfortunate fad of revising history for the sake of making it fit the wishes of any special interest segment of society\n\nFunny enough, he is actually doing *exactly* that. Here is his explanation of why he painted the mural:\n\n&gt;Lawlessness among ex-slaves and troublesome whites was the rule of the day. No relief was given by the carpetbag and scalawag government or by the Union troops. The result was the emergence of secret societies claiming to bring law and order to the county. One of these groups was the Ku Klux Klan, an organization that sometimes took vigilante justice to extremes but was sometimes the only control the county knew over those outside the law. The Klan faded from view at the end of Reconstruction. It had minor come-backs in the 1920’s and mid 1950’s. Since then it has become the subject of legend rather than a cause of fear.\n\nYea, no. Let's go through this bit by bit.\n\n&gt;Lawlessness among ex-slaves and troublesome whites was the rule of the day.\n\nThere is no way in Hell this can be substantiated. We do know that Reconstruction was part of an overall very violent period in terms of crime rates that existed from about 20 years before the Civil War to about 20 years after, but we do not have any racial statistics as to who was committing those violent crimes. To up and say it was largely the ex-slaves isn't backed by the evidence. [Source] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ian-reifowitz/race-and-murder-in-america_b_4843630.html) In fact, the fact that this period of high murder rates existed both before and after Reconstruction seems to suggest that blaming Reconstruction is not at all correct. Not to mention that he does not go on to explain exactly who those troublemaking whites were. Given that the South of the period was mostly either white or ex-slave, blaming ex-slaves and troublemaking whites has no meaning, because a criminal is of course a troublemaker.\n\n&gt;No relief was given by the carpetbag and scalawag government or by the Union troops.\n\nWhile he is certainly correct that Unionists were very active in the Southern governments during Reconstruction, to say they provided no crime relief falls flat. After all,\n\n&gt;In 1871 and 1872, federal marshals, assisted by U. S. troops, brought to trial scores of Klansmen, crushing the organization\n\n[Source](http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/exhibits/reconstruction/section5/section5_intro.html)\n\nThis source goes on to mention that the North largely withdrew from Reconstruction, having lost their will, after the crushing of the KKK. This is a very important detail, because it blows apart the next assertion:\n\n&gt;The result was the emergence of secret societies claiming to bring law and order to the county. One of these groups was the Ku Klux Klan, an organization that sometimes took vigilante justice to extremes but was sometimes the only control the county knew over those outside the law.\n\nThat logic doesn't really work when the Feds stepped in and whomped the KKK before abandoning Reconstruction. In fact, the KKK frequently waged guerilla warfare against the local authorities, even fighting each other when factions had differences of opinion. [Source] (http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/history.html?LEARN_Cat=ExtremismLEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_Americaxpicked=4item=kkk%20) That doesn't sound like maintaining control over crime to me, it sounds like creating a lot of the crime. It is perhaps the case that the KKK were those troublemaking whites the artist mentioned earlier?\n\n&gt;The Klan faded from view at the end of Reconstruction. It had minor come-backs in the 1920’s and mid 1950’s. Since then it has become the subject of legend rather than a cause of fear.\n\nAbsolutely and hilariously wrong. The 1920s wasn't a minor comeback, it propelled the Klan to a level of power it never saw during Reconstruction, and expanded the organization to hating much more than just blacks and carpetbaggers, adding Jews, Catholics, Eastern Europeans, and more. It was also the time in which the KKK numbered in the millions and was a part of mainstream society. That's a pretty big fucking comeback. Likewise, the KKK was pretty damn active during the Civil Rights movement. 35-50 thousand is no small number for a group of active domestic terrorists. No group active in the US today can come close to those numbers. You can't call that minor, especially with all the people they killed and community centers they burned or blew up.[Source](http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/publication/Ku-Klux-Klan-A-History-of-Racism.pdf)\n\nIn short, our artist has no idea at all what the fuck he is talking about, and he's lionizing things that deserve condemnation. To go back to that first assertion,\n\n\n&gt; did not follow the current and unfortunate fad of revising history for the sake of making it fit the wishes of any special interest segment of society\n\nIt looks like he was doing some revising to fit his own special interest in making the KKK out to be something other than a bunch of terrorists.",

Here are some gems:\n\n&gt;Thats absolutely ridiculous. The average southern white had no interest in preserving slavery at all. The idea of owning a slave was laughable to the average middle-class southerner. Thats like saying that all common people today have a vested interest in shipping jobs overseas so its cheaper for big businesses. They were either \n\n&gt;1) Caught up in political, nationalistic fervor 2) Shamed into joining by the hyper-masculine culture and peer pressure 3) Drafted 4) Legitimately believed in the dominance of states rights over that of the federal government, with succession being supported in legal precedent by the declaration of independence \"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\"\n\n&gt;A poor white man was certainly NOT worth more than a slave. For work, you would actually have to PAY him. Many poor whites (especially in the Appalachian region) were completely against slavery and fought for the North e.g. West Virginia.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csc5n25\n\n&gt;The states, their leaders, and their politicians? Yes... more than likely so.. (although there are more factors than slavery, but I will not get into that because slavery was definitely a main driver).\nBut the average soldier? They were fighting for their rights, their lands, and their homes. They didn't own slaves nor did they benefit from it. I am not saying the flag isn't a symbol of hate... it is a symbol of many things, heritage and valor included. But I would not say it ONLY stands for slavery.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csbx0f2\n\n&gt;I already started. Nobody has responded because it's easier to post things like \"nuh uhhhh\" and \"no you are\". But I'll repeat for you.\n\n&gt;For starters, most Southerners never owned a single slave. In 1860, 95% of the slaves in the US were owned by 5% of the population.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csc6xd7\n\n&gt;Not in the mind of Lincoln and federal policy pre and post-war. Lincoln had no intention of ending slavery in the South.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csc7iiy\n\n&gt;Not even all their leaders. General Lee hated slavery.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csbxlq5\n\nThere are dozens more, probably hundreds. But that was just from a single comment thread.\n\nThe refutations are pretty obvious, but I'll post some anyway.\n\n*On \"average middle-class Southerners\" (I'm not even sure that was a thing in the 1800's, but I'll go with it) having no interest in preserving slavery*:\n\n&gt;Defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and killing economic impact in the South where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy. The cotton economy would collapse. The tobacco crop would dry in the fields. Rice would cease being profitable.\n\n&gt;Defenders of slavery argued that if all the slaves were freed, there would be widespread unemployment and chaos. This would lead to uprisings, bloodshed, and anarchy. They pointed to the mob's \"rule of terror\" during the French Revolution and argued for the continuation of the status quo, which was providing for affluence and stability for the slaveholding class and for all free people who enjoyed the bounty of the slave society.\n\nSource- http://www.ushistory.org/us/27f.asp\n\nThe South overwhelmingly supported slavery because it represented the foundation of its economy. The idea that the \"average southern white\" had no interest in preserving slavery is as laughable as it is wrong. Why the hell did they go to war over it then, in many cases eagerly?\n\n*On the majority of soldiers simply fighting for their rights, land, and homes*:\n\nThis is debatable at best and patently false at worst. In the buildup to the Civil War, Lincoln never once threatened to take the homes or lands of anyone, nor did he wish to disenfranchise them in any way. At most he just didn't want slavery to expand into new territory, which the South absolutely wanted. He desperately wanted to keep the US together, and the idea of him being an invading force before the war started is ludicrous. But as to the soldiers fighting for their homes after the war had already begun, there's something to that. The Conscription Acts after 1862 thrust thousands of fighting age men onto the front lines, and it's hard to say what their motivations were. However, we do know that [a very large portion of the Confederate Army, including its entire initial force, was made up of militias formed by volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army#Organization), and their homes and lands were never directly threatened by the North until the secessions.\n\n*On 95% of the slaves being owned by 5% of the population*:\n\nThis number looks very much like an ass-pull, as I can find no credible sources to back it up. In fact, [the stat appears to come from a biased \"Southern Heritage\" blog that cites \"census data\" or some such](http://www.southernheritage411.com/truehistory.php?th=094). Other sources put [the number at closer to a third](http://www.civilwarcauses.org/stat.htm). Either way the point is moot, because there was almost universal tacit approval of slavery in the South, and that is more than enough to be ashamed of.\n\n*On Lincoln having no intention of ending slavery*:\n\nAs I said earlier, Lincoln was desperate to keep the Union intact, and did indeed hesitate when it came to immediate emancipation. But to say that he never wanted to end it is asinine. As early as 1837 he expressed his disdain for it, and by 1861 he said this:\n\n&gt;I say now, however, as I have all the while said, that on the territorial question -- that is, the question of extending slavery under the national auspices, -- I am inflexible. I am for no compromise which assists or permits the extension of the institution on soil owned by the nation. And any trick by which the nation is to acquire territory, and then allow some local authority to spread slavery over it, is as obnoxious as any other.\n\nOh, and there was that little document he himself signed on January 1, 1863.\n\nSource- http://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/slavery.htm[11]\n\n*On General Lee hating slavery*:\n\nThis is refuted right in the thread. So I'll copy it here-\n\n&gt;In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral &amp; political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, &amp; while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former.\n\nThis user expands on that, and does a good job showing that Lee's \"hatred\" wasn't enough to stop him from supporting it in some pretty fundamental ways.\n\nSource(s)- \n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3aekpe/til_the_confederate_battle_flag_the_modern_day/csbxql7\n\nhttp://fair-use.org/robert-e-lee/letter-to-his-wife-on-slavery\n\nSo there it is.

        "text": "[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbvDRY0O30E)\n\nSorry for the low-hanging fruit that is Gavin McInnes, it came up in my youtube related videos after watching the mockumentary [CSA: The Confederate States of America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exnwTWfFRM8) and it made me fidget in my chair in anger just listening to it. It's also my first badhistory post, so I figured I'd get my foot in the door with something rather simple (yet apparently not obvious to everyone as the video has got a 75% approval rating). Disclaimer: I'm going to be using the term \"Confederate Flag\" quite loosely here, I realise it's not the official flag but rather the battle flag, however specifics like these would just be besides the point in my opinion.\n\nI'll just contend his five points in the order he mentions them.\n\nBefore we get started with the meat of his arguments, I'd like to point out that he repeatedly introduces himself as Canadian and therefore magically *unbiased*. Everyone has bias! Furthermore, when dealing with a matter of debate, having personal convictions and providing evidence that supports your point is kinda the whole objective. But onto his main arguments.\n\n\n**1) The Civil War was an American Holocaust** (and for some reason the Confederate flag is the best way to remember its history and honor its veterans?)\n\n&gt; The Confederate flag needs to be commemorated because we should never forget the stunning amount of deaths in this war.\n\nI completely agree, but there's certainly got to be other ways to go about this than flying a flag associated with slavery and racism? [Germans certainly don't remember the death of 10% of their population during World War II this way.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a)\n\n&gt; Six hundred twenty thousand people died, five hundred thousand of those were Confederates.\n\nNot to delegitimise the horrible thing that is death on the battlefield or make it sound like any life lost is less valuable than the other, but [these statistics are demonstrably false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) and seem to be used to convey an attitude of victimisation towards the Confederacy. He also brings up captivity as a leading cause of death, specifically mentioning the [Shohola train wreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohola_train_wreck) while quickly brushing aside the true leading cause of death, [disease, which took twice as many lives as battle](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/death-numbers/).\n\n&gt; Proportionally, civil war deaths would be like six million dying today. Six million. Ring any bells?\n\nIf he's honestly trying to equate war to genocide when [war or active fighting is by definition not genocide](http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf) I don't know what else to say.\n\n**2) The Civil War was not about slavery, but rather states' rights.**\n\nRisen from its grave, the classic Confederate apologia is back. Luckily, [/u/Georgy_K_Zhukov has already written the definitive volume on this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3boun3/the_lost_cause_the_american_civil_war_and_the/). A good tl;dr (although you should read it) would probably be the [reasons the Confederate themselves gave when seceding](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html), all of which make slavery a forefront issue. McInnes does earn bonus points for throwing in a civil war reenactment photo of an black man holding a confederate flag though! (Because we all know that reenactments are *always* accurate portrayals of battle).\n\n**3) Lincoln was a racist**\n\n&gt; I don't know where we get this image of Lincoln being a non-racist\n\nWhen in doubt, break out presentism and tu quoque. [Clickbait and shoddy journalistic sites have been oh-so-eager to break out the racist Lincoln topic](http://atlantablackstar.com/2015/05/05/not-great-emancipator-10-racists-quotes-abraham-lincoln-said-black-people/). He's honestly scraping the bottom of the barrel here. To say that Lincoln didn't adhere to some Social Darwinist concepts would be false, but it would be even more wrong to forget all that he did in the name of equality, and to forget that his legacy would lead to the ratification of the 13, 14, and 15 amendments. With the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation (which Confederate apologists are always happy to point out didn't free any slaves), Lincoln reiterated that not only was this war about slavery, but that he would not allow the Union to stand half slave and half free - because it could not stand half slave and half free. That alone should stand testament to his progressive policy for the era. To juxtapose social standards from 150 years ago and today is quite blatantly unjust.\n\nPerhaps the more direct rebuttal to this though is that Lincoln's stance is entirely irrelevant on the issue. Lincoln could've supported sending all African-Americans to Liberia, it wouldn't change the fact that the Confederate flag is associated with slavery and racism.\n\n**4) We don't negotiate with terrorists.**\n\nExcept for when the United States *does* negotiate with terrorists. [*cough cough*](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/03/the-u-s-does-negotiate-with-terrorists/)\n\nThat's not even the most wrong part of this point though! The Charleston shootings merely shed light on the racism still present in American society today. Unless the shooter was playing some sort of long-con wherein [getting caught was part of his plan](http://static2.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/If+i+pulled+those+glasses+of+would+you+die+_6572d8e9ace907ec6e521a7cb72b4bbc.jpg) in order to raise social awareness about racism in America in hopes that it would lead to the taking down of the Confederate flag, it's not negotiation. He makes an analogy to the [1927 Bath school disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster) that's backwards - in his analogy, where the government *gives in* to the terrorist's demands, the Confederate flag would be hoisted above every school and an apartheid like state enforced. What's going on with the Confederate flag right now is the pretty much the exact opposite.\n\n**5) America was not built on Slavery**\n\nOh boy. [Much of the South](http://www.virginiaplaces.org/agriculture/graphics/slaves18602.gif) had, by the end of the colonial period and leading up to the Civil War, transitioned from an economy *with* slaves to an [an economy *dependent* on slaves](http://www.maritimetexas.net/Documents/SC.png). The raw value of slaves in the south pre-Civil War was worth more than the value of northern factories prior to the War's start. Slaves being used increasingly to [pick cotton](http://dtsdapache.hershey.k12.pa.us/wpmu/hs_aphg/files/2009/11/raw-cotton-graph.jpg). The south recognised this, and [King Cotton was a major part of the southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Cotton) both in the years leading up to war and as part of diplomatic efforts to earn recognition and support from other powers during the war. The South was quite literally dominated socially, politically, and economically by its cotton production and within that slavery.\n\nBut perhaps the most egregious statement is what was saved for last:\n\n&gt; After the Civil War, the balance was **zero**. Anything that was built up from slavery was gone...We all started on a blank slate.\n\nExcept for the part where [the practice of what is essentially slavery was carried on under a different name: sharecropping](http://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name/themes/sharecropping/).\n\nMcInnes goes on to suggest that the grave of two dead Confederate soldiers can only be properly honoured with Confederate memorabilia, and ends by quite literally pleading to Americans to \"get over it\" with regards to slavery.\n\nThat's all I have the energy to write right now. I do realise it's quite low-hanging fruit, but I figured it be a good way to get my foot in the door in this subreddit and it felt good to let out my frustration in a more peaceful manner. If you have any suggestions (or corrections!), let me know so I can be a better OP in the future. ",

He also attempts to disassociate National Socialism from fascism, which was pretty funny as well.\n\nBut then he moves on to throwing out some \"facts\" that he believed supported his argument, or whatever the fuck you want to call it. This is where we can actually measure his garbage philosophy to see if it's hatred that was borne from an unfortunate kernel of truth, or hatred that was spawned from just pure ignorance and stupidity. These Nat Soc assholes usually aren't worth the time, but this one is just so darn *sincere*, and really seems to be a poster child for the hyuck-hyuck goober white supremacist movement more than any other. \n\nSo I figure I'll have a go at him.\n\nFirst:\n\n&gt;I know you support Israel, even through U.S.S. Liberty attack, Lavon Affair, endless war on terror with no border definitions, and of course 100+ million dead to Jewish communism. (Thanks Rosenbergs for giving USSR our atomic weapons technology starting proxy cold wars in Korea/Vietnam etc.!)\n\n*Let's take a look at the USS Liberty \"attack\" as he calls it, though the more appropriate term would seem to be \"incident\" based on the findings of multiple inquiries on both sides*:\n\n&gt;**The CIA Memoranda consist of two documents: one dated June 13, 1967, and the other dated June 21, 1967.** The June 13 memorandum is an \"account of circumstances of the attack ... compiled from all available sources.\" The June 21 memorandum is a point-by-point analysis of Israeli inquiry findings of fact. **It concludes: \"The attack was not made in malice toward the U.S. and was by mistake, but the failure of the IDF Headquarters and the attacking aircraft to identify the Liberty and the subsequent attack by torpedo boats were both incongruous and indicative of gross negligence.\"**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident#U.S._government_investigations\n\nThe US Naval Court of Inquiry and Joint Chiefs of Staff reports also resulted in similar findings, though their investigations were not, for all intents and purposes, focused on determining any culpability at that time. Suffice it to say that both sides reached a satisfactory conclusion that this incident was a result of negligence, overzealousness, and paranoia. It was not, however, an act of full on aggression as Na7Soc implies. There's obviously a tremendous amount of controversy attached to this tragedy, but to use it as evidence of Israel's all encompassing evil is just stupid an entirely devoid of any good sense.\n\n*On \"100+ million dead to Jewish communism\"*:\n\nI have no idea where this number comes from. It's an ass-pull for sure, but I can't even figure out what he's referencing here. Russia or something? Maybe one of you guys can help? I have no fucking clue what this shitbird is on about.\n\n*On the Rosenbergs for giving USSR our atomic weapons technology starting proxy cold wars in Korea/Vietnam etc.*:\n\nThe Soviets were already well underway toward developing their own atomic weapons by the early 1940's. The Rosenberg's and other spies did play a role in aiding that effort. But to say that they, and by extension *all Jews*, were responsible for \"giving Russia the Bomb\" is utterly preposterous. The Russians had utilized everything from kidnapped Nazi scientists to reading declassified American material like the Smyth Report to aid them in their efforts. Laying responsibility at the feet of two spies is like saying two construction workers built every bridge in New York City by themselves. And then making the leap to the Jews being responsible for the Korean and Vietnam conflicts... well... you know, crazy Nat Soc bullshit is all.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smyth_Report#Publication\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project#Beginnings_of_the_program\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen he posts this unenlightened garbage from everyone's favorite hate rag American Renaissance:\n\nhttp://www.amren.com/news/2015/07/professor-reason-itself-is-a-white-male-construct/\n\nIt contains this:\n\n&gt;“I think that what modern philosophers call ‘pure’ reason–the Cartesian ego cogito and Kant’s transcendental consciousness–is a white male Euro-Christian construction,” he says. “White is not ‘neutral.’ ‘Pure’ reason is lily white, as if white is not a color or is closest to the purity of the sun, and everything else is ‘colored.’ Purification is a name for terror and deportation, and ‘white’ is a thick, dense, potent cultural signifier that is closely linked to rationalism and colonialism. What is not white is not rational. So white is philosophically relevant and needs to be philosophically critiqued–it affects what we mean by ‘reason’–and ‘we’ white philosophers cannot ignore it.”\n\n- *Professor John D. Caputo, who is the Thomas J. Watson professor of religion emeritus at Syracuse University*\n\nSo basically this snippet (because this is taken from a professor from Syracuse University, and it's pretty obvious that the quote has been cherry-picked) is being used by the authors of the post to essentially say that \"Hur look at the librul saying sanity is just an example of white privilege. Look how stupid he is!\"\n \nBut what AR and other right wingnuts conveniently left out was that he went on to say this:\n\n&gt;But I also think we have to take account of the professionalization and corporatization of the university, where our livelihood depends upon becoming furiously specialized technicians who publish in very narrow areas. Racism — like sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, religious discrimination, mistreatment of animals, environmental destruction, economic inequality — is a complex problem. All these problems demand to be addressed responsibly, and that requires expertise, a command of the literature, a knowledge of history, etc. No one can do all that, especially people trying to find jobs and later on get tenure and promotion, unless it intersects with their specialty in some pertinent way.\n\nProfessor Caputo's basically just saying that our backgrounds and life experiences color our perception of all sorts of issues, so it behooves us to look at things from every conceivable angle and approach things like race in a responsible and measured manner. He ruminates, “To what extent is everything you just said a function of being white?” when speaking about racial issues. That's actually a very fair question.\n\nThese trolls are fixated on a misinterpretation of what he's stating here. They believe he's just another limo liberal member of the detached-from-reality intelligentsia who's beating an SJW style drum about how \"reason is a white male construct\" and pushing a deluded anti-white agenda. They think he's tearing down reason solely because it's espoused by white men. But that's not what he's saying at all. There's basically two separate definitions of \"reason\" at work here, but the outage pornographers are taking their interpretation and running with it as per usual.\n\nNat Soc ignorance's #1 rule: Outrage first, truth comes later or better yet not at all.\n\n-----------------------------------\nAnd then we'll end it with this gem:\n\nhttp://nationalvanguard.org/2015/07/south-korean-media-jewish-financial-power-is-ruthless-and-merciless/\n\nHe posts this as proof the \"Koreans get that Jews are bad\" or some shit. As if this was completely representative of both Koreas in their entirety.\n\nBasically it posits that since some Jews are involved in high level finance, then it's proof that all Jews are engaged in a massive conspiracy to I don't fucking know my head is starting to hurt and my brain is beginning to leak out my nose I think. Read it for yourself if you have the time, energy, and oxycodone handy.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nI'll end it there. If I missed anything please let me know. When I started this I thought it would be fun to pick apart such asinine crap, but after a while it just started to seem like work because there's just so much fucking *stupid* to sort through. Even his posted sources are just rabbit holes of *stupid*.\n\nI'm not even gonna go near the Bernie Sanders jackassery. Maybe some other time.\n\nFeel free to peruse the links and correct me as needed! Cheers!\n\n\n",

        "text": "*Author's note*: This was originally supposed to be x-posted a while back but it slipped my mind. Low hanging fruit alert - its about wikipedia ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nI recently began reading Don Fox's history of the US 4th Armored Division, and to my surprise, the book had a robust and glowing foreward written by none other than Martin Blumenson, a man deeply important to developing histories of the US Army in the immediate and post-war eras. In terms of dry military histories, he is essentially a, if not *the* authority on the US Army's actions in Europe during the course of the war. In short: He's a very important read for getting a larger, drier picture of events. Fox's history takes the greater narrative of Blumenson and narrows it down to a single unit -in this case, a division- and tends to give otherwise faceless soldiers a voice, for better or worse.\n\nIn short, its just good practice to combine your readings of general or academic pieces with well researched and sourced specific histories. Veteran's testimonies and single-source reading allows for source-bias to creep into your mind. For example, if I were to have only read Don Fox's book, I would've become convinced that the 4th Armored did indeed run into such a high concentration of \"88s\" in its fighting in August. Blumenson and others shed more factual light on inconsistencies/exaggerations within Veteran's testimonies. Its a necessary step in filling out an accurate picture of events that are now just beginning to go beyond the limit's of human memory.\n\nOkay, okay. I'll get to the point. Its good to use multiple sources, Wikipedia, like any secondary-source anthology, may be a very good place to get a list of potential books to read, evaluate, challenge, etc. This is a basic tenet of research: just like I would go to a reporter's anthology to find relevant case law for my studies, I would never be daft enough to cite them directly, but rather go to the source legislation or Judge's notes(now *knowing* that source) to make sure the reporter briefed the case and applicable law/common law in a correct fashion. Going to the source is something that should always be done.\n\n[Exhibit A](http://s4.postimg.org/vtnecq8v1/exhibit_a.png):\n\n\nThis is the references section for an article on an obscure unit that opposed the 4th Armored division sometime in late August, 1944. I was curious to try and get more information from the German side viz. a particular series of actions and more general background (when was the unit formed? how did it perform? what was its demographics?). To my (initial) delight, the Wikipedia page was fairly in depth and had many citations for such a small, obscure subject. Then I saw the actual references.\n\n**WHY ITS FULL OF SHIT**:\n\nWhoever edited this Wikipedia page is sipping the kool-aid or is over-eager. He has two sources, one academic (big ole' checkmark here), the other not (feldgrau.net - actual lol). He uses only a handful (4) of pages from the academic source, and the citations are few and far between. Presumably, Landwher's book is equally well-sourced and detailed as say, Don Fox's book. We can presume it has all the same potential weaknesses (lack of, or faulty, veteran's testimony, etc.) and therefore offers a nice foil to Mr. Fox's publication. In short, its a good source (Its fucking *not*, but one thing at a time kinder).\n\nYet feldgrau gets cited constantly, much more than Landwehr. But the source is scanty to say the least:\n\n[Exhibit B](http://postimg.org/image/48rdmohnd/):\n\nIts short, unsourced, and comes from a site with a reasonable presumption of user-bias (\"feldgrau\" should be sounding klaxons). The latter bit would be mitigated greatly by the presence of the former, but given that its (a) heavily cited and (b)completely unsourced we must conclude it is not academic (duh) and therefore belongs nowhere near an encyclopedia page.\n\nThus the problems begin. Let's quote two snippets of the 51 SS-PzGren. Brigade's article concerning the battle of Troyes. For the record, Landwehr citations will be *italicized* while feldgrau citations will be **bolded**:\n\n&gt;*The next day 25 August, Troyes was attacked by a large American tank force of the U.S. 4th Armored Division* which *captured or destroyed the 8th Company, a medical detachment and the Brigade Motor Transport unit*. The assault lasted all day and by late afternoon **the tank assault had been turned back, but a large force from the French Resistance had surrounded the Brigade Headquarters**. Soon afterwards the Americans returned and occupied Troyes and all contact with Brigade Headquarters was lost by 1630 hours.\n\n&gt;**Sturmbannfuehrer Walter Joecke gave orders that the Brigade staff, Headquarters Company and the Pionier Company should fight their way out of the town and rejoin the rest of the Brigade. Fighting house to house they fought their way free of the town, which surprised the Americans who had expected them to surrender.**\n\n&gt;**The SS Pionier Company 51, covered the break out losing all its officers but they were effective and their sacrifice was not in vain. Their effectiveness in house to house fighting won praise from the American General George Patton and it was documented in his memoirs.**\n \nThree brief paragraphs dedicated to the most significant action of the unit - the defense of Troyes - and only *one* citation intersects with both sources, the very first Landwehr source. The rest come from the unsourced text of feldgrau, and from reading both Blumenson and Fox (if you're keeping track, that's 2 academically appropriate sources kiddos), its quite clear that whoever wrote the Feldgrau article desperately whitewashed what was an undeniable asskicking.\n\nFrom Blumenson, which despite being a grand history takes a paragraph to mention this action:\n\n&gt;CCA of the 4th Armored Division drove forty miles to the outskirts of Troyes on the morning of 25 August. There the bulk of the command launched a frontal attack in desert-spread formation. With tanks approximately a hundred yards apart and tankers firing their weapons continuously, the troops charged across three miles of open ground sloping down toward the city. Inside Troyes, the Germans fought back. Though street fighting continued through the night, the Americans were in possession of the greater part of the city by nightfall.\n\nThis already contradicts the Feldgrau citations that the 'tank attack was turned back' - Uh-oh Shaggy.\n\nFrom Fox, who is far more lengthy in his description, so I'll abbreviate:\n\n&gt;TF West would conduct a frontal assault on the city...\n\n&gt;Prior to the attack, [West] issued comprehensive orders for the assault on Troyes:\n\n&gt;...In essence, West's orders had created a classic wide-desert formation. \n\nWe already have corroboration between two valid sources. This is already strikes against the validity of the feldgrau article. Feldgrau also notes that two motor columns attempt to escape Troyes, and do so without incident, only citing minor air attack with little observable damage. This is questionable; as the only time Landwehr is cited again is describing the 'destruction' of the Brigade, which corroborates with Fox's description of one of the two motor columns being devestated by *armored vehicles* - not airpower. I quote:\n\n&gt;The Germans....at first light, before the American attack [crossed the Seine], the SS unit formed a column of a dozen vehicles and attempted to drive their way out of the city. As they made their way down one of the side streets, a Sherman tank from [C Company, 35th Tank Battalion] blocked their path and destroyed the two leading vehicles...\n\nThe differences in account and the lack of appropriate primary sources for the feldgrau article drive a stake into its heart; it has no traction, no grip on the letter of the events and should be discounted as an appropriate, credible source. Yet there it is, on wikipedia.\n\nNow we turn to Landwehr, I had been giving him the benefit of the doubt, and by his own admission in his book *Alarm Units! SS PanzerGrenadier Brigades 49 and 51* the brigade was cut to shreds:\n\n&gt; In the face of overpowering, advancing enemy elemnts, the disintegrating German forces could do little else but retreat in mixed-up order towards Verdun and Metz...\n\nPg. 133 of the aforementioned book.\n\nWho, however, *is* Richard Landwehr? Ostensibly this published work is a legitimate, trustworthy source, and the author lacking any alarming bias. Nope. Turns out he's a shiteating holocaust denier - I'm not sure what I was expecting from a guy who wrote almost exclusively about the SS. He has written for the [Institute for Historical Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Historical_Review) a blustering academic name for what is essentially a holocaust denial organization.\n\nThe man's own words are damning:\n\n&gt;After a generation of slander, vilification and falsehood concerning the European volunteers, the first rays of light are beginning to shine through. Slowly, but surely, their story is being told. As for the soldiers themselves, **many are of the belief that they were ahead of their time, both militarily and philosophically**, and that their legacy is yet to be fulfilled. For myself, perhaps the most incisive observation was made by the former Waffen-SS Colonel Joachim Peiper in a letter to his comrades while he was being held in American confinement under sentence of death: 'Don't forget that it was in the ranks of the SS that the first European died'.\n\nAYYY LMAO. So he's simply not a good source, the entire article on Wikipedia is more or less horseshit. I'll stick to Blumenson and Fox, thanks.\n\n**TL;DR: RECONFIRMING WIKIPEDIA IS A SHIT FUCKING SOURCE AND NEVER GIVE WEHRABOOS/MUH-SS HOMEBOYS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN THEY CITE IT**\n\n",

She went to jail for real but she walked on that bus with the intent of being hauled off and it had been planned for weeks if not months. \n\nThis is the fourth highest upvoted answer. It's also completely wrong.   \n\nI've seen the story of Rosa Parks's famous bus arrest as being a planned publicity stunt for a long time (I even saw it referenced on an episode of \"The Boondocks\"). I have no idea where it came from but there's zero evidence for it. It is true that Rosa Parks had been a political activist for a long time, and that the NAACP had been planning the campaign that followed her arrest for months. They were looking for the right case to launch it, and Parks fit the bill perfectly, but nothing about her arrest itself was planned, nor was the white man who arrested her in on it. (She had had a prior run-in with the bus driver, James Blake, but that was incidental.)\n\n&gt; 4. Her act of civil disobedience was not pre-meditated.\n\n&gt; Although Parks knew that the NAACP was looking for a lead plaintiff in a case to test the constitutionality of the Jim Crow law, she did not set out to be arrested on bus 2857. Parks wrote in her autobiography that she was so preoccupied that day that she failed to notice that Blake was driving the bus. “If I had been paying attention,” she wrote, “I wouldn’t even have gotten on that bus.”\n\nhttp://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-rosa-parks\n\nIncidentally, the poster in question is taking pains to point out that his (wrong) story doesn't take away from Parks's accomplishments, which I agree with. A lot of people, including me at one point, believed this very common myth without feeling it discredited Parks or the Montgomery boycott. The only problem with it is that it didn't happen.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3d3c74/doctor_who_meets_robin_hood_and_everything_is/",
        "text": "All right, so I figured if this sub can point out the historical climatological errors in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I can nitpick some fucking Doctor Who. Specifically, we'll be looking at the third episode of the 34th season, \"Robots of Sherwood,\" written by Mark Gatiss. Because there's some things that have bothered me ever since I read the script when it leaked a while back, and I gotta get this off my chest, for my sake. And hey, I still have that script downloaded. I'm gonna be summarizing the episode as I go, so spoilers if you're behind. And without further ado:\n\nWe open in the TARDIS, with the Doctor inviting Clara to go anywhere in space and time she pleases. She asks to meet Robin Hood, and reluctantly, he agrees.\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\nVery well. Earth.\nEngland.\nSherwood Forest.\n1190 AD. Ish.\n\nSo the timeframe chosen is a bit peculiar. The 1190s would cover the reign of Richard I, with whom Robin Hood is popularly associated. However, this association is not present in the earliest legends. *A Gest of Robyn Hode,* one of the earliest extant ballads, names the reigning monarch Edward, but it isn't clear which Edward is being referred to. The best fit, based on the early ballads' description of the king as \"cumly\" is Edward III (r. 1327-1377) (see the footnote on line 1412 [here](http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/gest-of-robyn-hode)). But assuming (dubiously) that Robing Hood existed, and that the earliest material is indicative of when he lived, then the furthest back we can go is 1272, when Edward I ascended. Even if those early ballads were wrong, it seems a little too convenient that later versions of the legend just happened to get everything right. But regardless, the Doctor and Clara do run into Robin Hood immediately, and the Doctor is understandably incredulous.\n\n\nAfter that initial meeting, we cut to Nottingham, where the legendary sheriff is extracting money from a villager.\n\n&gt;One of the KNIGHTS flips open the casket he's carrying. It's full\nof jewels and gold coins. Oddly, the SHERIFF throws aside the\njewels and runs his fingers through the coins.\n\nIf you're committing to a 12th century setting, nobody in England should have that many gold coins. The first gold coin circulated in England was the gold penny, which was introduced by Henry III (r. 1216-1272), and was unpopular. The first widely circulated gold currency in England didn't come about until the reign of... Edward III. Funny that. \n\nThe Sheriff makes a big deal about all this gold, and we cut back to the Doctor and Robin Hood.\n\n&gt;A hog roasts on a spit. THE DOCTOR is in amongst the greenery,\nripping down branches and scanning them with the sonic. ROBIN\nis introducing CLARA to a group of MEN. They're all in Lincoln\nGreen and very... MERRY.\n\nThe phrase \"merry men\" referred generically to members of an outlaw band without specific reference to Robin Hood going back to the 13th century. Having all the Merry Men act merry is like having having a group of wise guys in a mafia flick demonstrate actual wisdom. They can just be criminals with some emotional range, but they all laugh throughout the episode as if to justify the title. Then again, maybe this band's characteristic merriness was in fact the etymological origin of the phrase.\n\nOne of the Merry Men we meet is Friar Tuck. The first order of friars, the Fransiscans, wasn't founded until 1209, and they didn't reach England until 1224. This might be excusable in other adaptations, since both Friar Tuck and Richard I are such iconic figures in the Robin Hood legend in spite of this incompatibility, but if we're going back in time to see the real historical Robin Hood, you'd think they'd avoid such blatant anachronism. Even the 2006 TV show made him a Cistercian. And besides, it's not like Mark Gatiss is absolutely faithful to the most popular version of the legend, since Little John, usually an ironically named giant, has dwarfism here.\n\nDuring this scene, while the Doctor performs various scientific tests to determine the true nature of the Merry Men (and can't come to any firm conclusions), Will Scarlet clarifies the timeframe a bit:\n\n&gt;King Richard is away on\nCrusade, my Lady, and his tyrant of a\nbrother rules instead.\n\nSo this puts the story some point between 1191 and 1194, in case you were trying to justify things by noting that \"1190. Ish.\" could potentially be a fair bit later and excuse those anachronisms. I know I was.\n\nThen there's this exchange:\n\n&gt;ROBIN\nI do not live this outlaw life by choice,\nmy Lady. You see before you Robert, Earl-\n\n&gt;CLARA\nEarl of Loxley!\n\n&gt;ROBIN\n(puzzled)\nYes.\n\nSo a few notes here: The idea of Robin Hood as a deposed noble is another later addition to the legend. A hypothetical historical Robin Hood is much more likely to have been a yeoman, as the earliest ballads identify him as such pretty much univocally. Also, \"Earl of Loxley\" was never a title, although Robin Hood has been, in separate traditions, been identified as a native of Loxley and as the former Earl of Huntington (a title held by David of Scotland when this story is set). \n\nAnyhow, as the Doctor still finds all of this very dubious, the following exchange occurs.\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\nWhat time is it, Mr Hood?\n\n&gt;ROBIN\nSomewhat after noon –\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\n(snaps)\nNo, no. Time of year! The season.\n\n&gt;ROBIN\nDame Autumn has draped her mellow\nskirts about the forest, Doctor. The\ntime of mists and harvest approaches-\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\nYes, yes. All very poetic. But it's very\ngreen hereabouts, though, isn't it?\nAnd, like I said, very sunny.\n\n&gt;CLARA\nSo?\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\nHave you ever been to Nottingham?\n\n&gt;CLARA\nClimate change?\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\n1190.\n\nI don't know enough about the climate of Nottingham in the late 12th century to comment on this. Perhaps /u/Quouar could lend me a hand.\n\nAnyhow, next we get the famous archery contest. This version includes the bit where Robin Hood splits another arrow down the middle, which originates in the 1819 novel *Ivanhoe* (at least according to [this Robin Hood enthusiast](http://www.boldoutlaw.com/rhbal/bal152.html)). Again, it's funny how well history aligns with the versions of the legend popularized centuries after the fact. Although most of those fail to mention how a snarky 2000 year old space alien with a Scottish accent subsequently split Robin's arrow. Or how the two of them took turns splitting each other's arrows, or how afterwards said alien was attacked by knights, or how those knights were actually robots from outer space who shot purple lasers out of their visors. But I'll give the story some leeway here, since *Doctor Who* relies on robots from outer space interfering in history all the time, and I can respect the show's conventions. \n\nSo the Doctor, Robin, and Clara get captured, and imprisoned, and we see those people the Sheriff took that improbably gold from earlier are being used for slave labor. One of them gets killed by robots. The Sheriff interrogates/hits on Clara and reveals that he saw the spaceship crash, found mechanical men inside, and plans to use them to achieve world domination. Typical *Who* villain stuff. The Doctor and Robin escape and go into the castle's keep, and find the interior of a crashed spaceship, which disguised itself as a castle and its inhabitants as knights, blending into the surroundings. Apparently an entire stone castle appearing one day was entirely inconspicuous to the locals. After the Doctor explains all this, he figures out what's with all the Nottingham weirdness:\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\nBut the engines...The engines are\ndamaged.\n\n&gt;More schematics come up.\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\nThey're leaking radiation into the\nlocal atmosphere creating a temporary\nmicro-climate of staggering\nbenevolence. \n\n&gt;ROBIN\nBeg pardon?\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\nI told you! It's too sunny, it's too\ngreen. And there's even an evil Sheriff\nto oppress the locals! This explains\neverything. Even you.\n\n&gt;ROBIN\nIt does?\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR looks ROBIN up and down.\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR\nWell, what does every oppressed\npeasant workforce need? The illusion\nof hope! Some silly story to get them\nthrough the day, lull them into\ndocility and keep them working.\n\n&gt;FX: His fingers dance again and the screens before them are suddenly\nfilled with images of ROBIN HOOD. Storybooks, (non-copyright)\nmovies, engravings, paintings. On and on and on they go.\n\n&gt;THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\nShip's data banks. Full of every myth\nand legend you could hope for.\nIncluding...Robin Hood! Friend of the\npoor!\n\nSo that's a feasible enough explanation for why the most popular version of Robin Hood happens to exist, at least by the standards of very soft science fiction in which time travel and perfect androids are commonplace. It also turns out not to be true, annoyingly, as if Gatiss was taunting my pedantic brain with the prospect of closer resemblance of the Whoniverse to our own, then snatching it all away. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nIt turns out the gold I've complained about so much was being used to repair the ship's circuits.  The Sheriff tries to use it to begin his conquest of England, but the Doctor warns that the ship is too damaged and will blow up. He finds away to send it into orbit before doing that happens, the day is saved. So Nottingham Castle is destroyed, even though in March of 1194, it was the site of an important siege by King Richard's forces against John's rebellion. Now John took power in October 1191, and this story is set, at the earliest, at some point during that autumn. So it's pretty damn remarkable that the entire castle was rebuilt with such little turnaround. But this is Whoniverse, so maybe aliens intervened in English history again during that time. \n\n",

        "text": "Unfortunately, I do not own Total War: ATTILA, but while checking it out on Steam I was delighted to see a [\"Celtic Culture pack\" DLC](http://store.steampowered.com/app/343461/) - you mean I can play as the Irish, Britons or Picts in late Antiquity? Awesome! Sadly, my expectations were quickly shattered when I started reading the actual product description. For my own sanity, I will only be criticizing the \"Ebdanian\" faction included in the DLC, as the Pictish and Caledonian ones are probably so full of bullshit that they smell like a rodeo. \n\nThe first and most bizarre item of badhistory is the fact that the Irish faction is called the \"Ebdanians\". The Eblani (*at least spell the goddamned name right, Total War*) were a people who were purported to live somewhere near modern Co. Dublin in Ptolemy's 2nd century BC *Geography*. Total War: ATTILA begins in 395 AD, nearly 600 years after Ptolemy's unique reporting of the existence of the Eblani, meaning that their continued existence was unlikely at best. Creative Assembly likely chose this arbitrary archaic population group because they were centered sort of near Dublin, the only unit of Irish geography familiar to most of its international audience. The fact that one faction owns the entirety of Ireland is also absurd, as the island was splintered into dozens (if not hundreds during this period) of local tribal polities, regional kingdoms, provincial kingdoms and inter-regional kingdoms.\n\nThe fact that the game picked a random population group (not even a kingdom, mind you) that probably didn't even exist in the game's timeframe is a great shame because the 4th-5th centuries were a crucial period in Irish history, when great dynastic kingships finally overcame and subjugated archaic tribal population groups. In fact, the beginning of the game's campaign coincides with the rule of one of Ireland's most famous sort of historical but also sort of mythical kings; Niall Noígíallach (Niall of the Nine Hostages), king of Tara, who was coronated sometime in the late 4th century and died sometime in the early 5th century. According to tradition, Niall got his nickname by subjugating the 5 provinces of Ireland (which meant giving hostages) and taking even more hostages from the Picts, the Britons, the Saxons and the Franks (which probably reflects him conducting frequent raids on Britain and the continent) and created the Uí Néill dynasty that dominated Ireland for another 500 years. He is also the genetic Genghis Khan of western Europe; 2-3 million men are patrilineally descended from him, including 8% of Ireland's population and 2% of New York's male population. How could you NOT make a faction based around this guy? \n\nContinuing on, the product description then states that:\n\n&gt;Alongside the common Celtic traits for raiding, the Ebdanians also have a talent for sacking and looting that combined gives them a unique playstyle and unrivalled potential for profiting bloodily at their enemies' expense. \n\nTrue, the Irish conducted a lot of amphibious raids during late Antiquity (St Patrick was originally a Briton enslaved by Irish raiders) but this had more to do with demographic and political pressure than an inherent talent for sacking and looting: Ireland, much like the Western Roman Empire, likely faced a severe shortage of manpower that was probably compounded by a low birthrate and extreme limitations on the kinds of labour that patrons could extract from their clients, as Irish customary law ensured that Irish freemen were comparatively 'freer' than peasants elsewhere in Europe. \n\nOkay, so with that out of the way let's look at the *worst* element of this DLC: the Irish unit roster. This roster is a sickening mish-mash of fantastical warriors mixed with actual Irish troops drawn from multiple periods in time, none of which really coincide with late Antiquity. To give some context: before the high medieval period, we don't really know how Irish wars were fought and who fought them. Some scholars accept the most-probably inflated numbers of troops and casualties reported in historical accounts of battles, which is the angle Total War has taken - noble units are mixed with all kinds of made up levies of commoners. In my own opinion, it seems that Irish warfare was very small scale, and *very* aristocratic. Levies of common peasants were probably unheard of until the early modern period, when the Irish lord Aodh Mór Ó Néill actually trained and armed his own subjects instead of relying on professional mercenaries, and came super close to expelling the English colony from Ireland. Early medieval battles were most likely fought by small bands of warrior-aristocrats and their retinues of noble clients, who probably fought unarmoured except for a small targe, and with a sword, spear and javelins. Though predictably, the noble units in game are shown to wear mail coats and carry large round shields. Early literary sources reveal that the ideology behind Irish warfare was intensely aristocratic; armies and individual warriors are compared to stags dueling in the wilds, while unfair and ungentlemanly conflicts were feared as much as the devastation of farmland, the destruction of homes and enslavement of women.\n\nSome of the Irish units are downright stupid. Kerns and Galloglasses are available as units unique to the Irish faction, although both kinds of troops actually come from the late medieval-early modern period. Gallowglasses are a particularly strange choice because they were Norse-Scottish men sent as diplomatic gifts or hired as mercenaries by Irish lords from the 13th century onwards, meaning that gallowglasses that appear in the game may possibly be time travelers.\n\nThe funniest unit is the Righdamhna, who are a bunch of javelin throwers. Unlike gallowglasses and kerns, the righdamhna were not a military unit but a title for men of a dynastic lineage who could possibly inherit a kingship - the word literally means \"kingly material\". This is the equivalent of having an American unit in a WWII strategy game named VICE PRESIDENT. There is no historical or literary precedent for such holders of a political title going into battle in formation. Also present in the game are the Fianna, who were less of a historical reality than the pagan Irish version of the Knights of the Round Table. \n\nPerhaps the most egregious of this DLC's mistakes is [this](http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/343461/ss_0d377e71943be1024c73d64d971cffb1384ad0db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1435333580). Can you spot what's wrong in this picture, depicting Irish horsemen? The answer is: PANTS. NOBODY IN IRELAND WORE PANTS (okay maybe some of them did but it was RARE) ~~UNTIL IRISH LORDS ABANDONED THEIR PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR CUSTOMS, DRESS AND TONGUE TO A COLONIZING POWER WHICH IMPOSED ITS OWN CULTURE, AFTER THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION WAS DISLOCATED BY WARS, REBELLIONS AND FAMINE  AND MARGINALIZED FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEF~~ various historical factors led to the adoption of many English customs. The early Irish wore long-sleeved tunics that draped below the knee with a large woolen cloak, the aristocracy having intricately manufactured clothing such as red tunics with embroidered gold thread and \"multicoloured\" (probably tartan) cloaks. They would have also worn all kinds of precious jewelery and had swords, shields and spears inlaid with gold, coral, silver and ivory. Needless to say, warfare in early Irish history was probably *fabulous*.\n",

The easiest way they know to express this is to fly a confederate flag. Because northern bigots believe that southerners are all bigots who hate black people, they associate the flag with racism.\nYou may or may not already know, race is a really complex issue in the states. There are a lot of white people eager to prove they aren't racist by pointing out people who are way more racist. Since the southern pride faction is pretty small, the media loves to shame them for these sorts of things. As you can see here on reddit, people tend to do the same in social situations to make sure they don't appear racist themselves.\n\n**Why is it bad history?**\n\nThe comment implies that the only reason why the Confederate flag is considered racist is because of \"bigoted northerners\".\n\n**What refutes this bad history?**\n\n1. [The responding comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3cxvfb/kid_rock_tells_confederate_flag_protesters_to/ct07h84) has a good response \n\n&gt;But actually, people associate that flag with racism because it was the symbol of a movement to keep black people enslaved, and later, was the symbol of a group of people that lynched thousands of black people. That's pretty simple to understand.\n\n2. [This comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3aguj7/south_carolina_state_rep_will_introduce_bill_to/cscmclc) in a different submission shows how various declarations of independence from confederate states showed that they were declaring independence over slavery. Here is one example\n\n&gt;Mississippi:\nOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth...We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property.\n\nThis helps shows that the Confederate cause was about maintaining the enslavement of African Americans and therefore also shows that the Confederate battle flag is a symbol of that cause.",

        "text": "So had a friend on facebook link me [this](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/11081227_485694378245279_7504908602758751973_n.jpg?oh=31cab780c09354d91d43dcc0aee7faeb&amp;oe=56236926), which has been making the rounds in atheist communities for awhile. The \"Jesus is Horus\" connection has been covered a bit here before, but this sums up a lot of bad info in one place, and it's amazing that almost everything about it, both about Horus and Jesus, is wrong.\n\nSo let's start with story of Horus \"written down 5,000 years ago,\" the implication here being the story of Jesus is cribbed from the Egyptian mythology of Horus. The problem here is that the story of Horus was never actually written down in any kind of comprehensive way. Stories about him appear in Egyptian funerary literature, books of spells and stories left at grave sites that are collectively known as *The Book of the Dead.* The problem with that title is that there is no single *Book of the Dead* but a number of different collections that reveal a changing view of the god Horus over many thousands of years. Stories about him date from the late pre-dynastic period and are widely inconsistent with one another. Early versions describe him as the brother of Isis and Osiris, while later interpretations make him their son. There is no singular story of Horus.\n\n\"Born of the virgin Isis\" is incorrect. Isis was a goddess, not human, so it's unclear if the term \"virgin birth\" is even applicable, but even if it was it would still be wrong. The most common interpretation has him born by Isis after being impregnated by Osiris, who she had resurrected after his body had been dismembered. As his phallus had been fed to catfish, she had a golden one constructed for him (I kind of wish this was the Jesus story now, honestly. Sunday school would have been so much more fun). Basically making Isis the definition of \"not a virgin.\" The [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus) on the origin story of Horus sums it up pretty well.\n\nRegarding the claim that both were born on December 25th: well, kinda. Christmas is celebrated on December 25th for many reasons, [none of them having to do with the story of Jesus told in the Scriptures](http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/how-december-25-became-christmas/), which mention no dates or time of year for when he was born. Any precise date is conjecture. There's no mention of the day December 25th until three centuries after his death, when Roman almanacs mention it and the reasons for choosing that particular date range from it being borrowed from Roman Saturnalia festivals to the fact that it's 9 months from when he is said to have died, thus linking his conception and death (this is Saint Augustine's view, for example). The reasoning behind Horus being born on December 25th are even slimmer. Plutarch's telling has him born on Winter Solstice, but he was writing about their beliefs as they stood around the 1st and early 2nd centuries AD, but as I noted the Horus myth went through a lot of permutations over many thousands of years, and nailing down an exact date while trying to match up ancient Egyptian and modern calenders is a fool's errand. In any case solstice is kind of a notable event and a lot of religious significance has been placed on it throughout history. Even if it could be said to be true, I'd call this one coincidence more than cribbing the myth.\n\nThe \"three wise men\" claim misses that the scripture doesn't mention how many wise men visited Jesus. The Horus claims come from Gerald Massey, an English poet who wrote a lot of totally invented garbage about Egyptian mythology in the late 19th, early 20th century. There's no record of a \"three wise men\" tale concerning Horus before Massey. As for the \"fled to escape the wrath of\" claims, Horus didn't have to be TAKEN to Egypt to escape anyone. He was born there. And it was Set (or Seth) who wanted him killed.\n\nStating Jesus taught in the temple as a child is a simplification. He asked and answered questions and impressed people with his responses. That's the extent of the scripture on that. As for Horus, this is entirely fabricated.\n\nThe \"baptized\" claims for Horus are another Massey fabrication. \"Anup the Baptizer\" is an invented character from Massey's work and doesn't appear in any Egyptian texts. The \"disciples\" is also Massey. In his *Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World* (published in 1907) he refers to an Egyptian mural depicting \"the twelve who reap the harvest.\" It's a real mural, with twelve figures, but no Horus. Horus is depicted having followers, but never 12 of them, and never described as what we would understand as \"disciples.\"\n\nThere's nothing particular in the Horus myth about healing the sick, so I'm calling that fabricated. The \"raised El-Azur-Us' from the dead\" claim is comical. First off, \"Eleazar\" is the Hebrew version of \"Lazarus.\" They seem to be trying to link him to raising Osiris (also called \"Asar\") by taking the Hebrew name for Lazarus and matching it with Asar by adding a Latin [Edit: Meant to type \"Spanish,\" not \"Latin\") \"the\" (\"El\") in the front and I guess throwing an \"us\" on there for effect. In any case, the resurrection of Osiris was traditionally considered to be performed by Isis, not Horus. \n\nThe list of names attributed to both Jesus and Horus only describe Jesus; pretty sure none of them were used to describe Horus. \n\nAnd finally, Horus couldn't have been buried in a tomb and resurrected, because there's no recorded stories of him dying.",
