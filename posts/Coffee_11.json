        "text": "I have a Timemore C2 manual burr grinder and I like it, but with my coffee habit I'm practically developing joint issues from so much cranking. The grinder holds up my morning routine and I'm at the point where I kind of dread making coffee. It was fun and novel at first but when I'm cranking 4 of them out consecutively it gets pretty tiresome. \n\nI want an automatic grinder but I'm not necessarily looking for an upgrade in quality of grind, I just want a machine to do it and save me the hassle in the mornings before work. I guess I'd prefer coffee-focused over espresso since I'm making my coffee with an AeroPress and I can only kind of fake an espresso with it anyway. \n\nAny ideas? The Baratza Encore seems like it might be OK, but the price point seems kind of low for something quality. The Fellow Ode looks more like it but at almost twice the price and seems like it'll take more maintenance to keep in shape. \n\nIf I start approaching $500-1000 range I figure I might as well just buy a Breville Barista or something that does it all for me (though that seems suspiciously cheap for an espresso machine).\n\nI'm kind of all over the place, but please kick me into touch here, my passion for coffee far, far outweighs my knowledge about it. \n\nThank you.",

(I'll get the SSP MP burrs later if needed, but I think I'll prefer the stock ones for the body and general profile) It took me so long to pick as there's always something that sounds good coming (Sculptor), Lagom P64- I've been on wait list so long and I'd now rather have the ease of purchasing from a local shop. (got Ode from Nordstroms)\n\nI have the Comandante hand grinder but am so ready for electric, especially since I like to make cold brew.  The Comandante has this big community of users where the clicks are included in recipes, reddit posts, and brew guides. I find this very helpful. Now I'm lost considering how to use the new grinder. Should I bother trying to translate grind setting by microns? (The Comandante is 30 microns per setting and can't find Ode 2 info). Since Ode 2 only has 31 settings I'm thinking translating microns won't make sense. Maybe I'm over-thinking this but I'm so comfortable dialing in with the Comandante that I'm not sure where to start with a new grinder. \n\nI'd appreciate any advise, especially someone comparing settings between Comandante and Ode 2 stock burrs.",

So i will need a grinding ( not planning for manual) but my budget is tight and came to a few grinders and wonder if they would work. Also due to my location, the normal barratza neo etc are extremely expensive.\n1. WPM ZD-10T/15/16\n2. Raccea 60mm \nDoes anyone have experience with these 2 grinder? If yes, would they suffice for an unpressurized basket?",

I grind 20 grams of coffee per day so not like I’m burning the grinder out. I’ll open it up to clean it out again but this is just frustrating to me for a grinder at this price point. \nAny suggestions on what to do? Am I not cleaning it enough?

(or just point me to an existing table)...**\n\nI understand that different grinders have *different particle distributions* and that a mapping between various make/model grinder settings is not 100% possible even if all grinders are fully calibrated. However, if such a table existed I could take a Commandante Setting discussion and map those settings to a grinder I own. This would give me a *head start* on a new or adjusted coffee recipe using *my grinder*. Then, of course, I'd have to do my own *dial in* to compensate for the unmatched particle size distributions... but I think such a table would save me time and, more importantly, coffee!\n\nHere's a sparsely filled out table to make my request more clear.\n\n* Baratza data is from: [https://www.baratza.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/VIRTUOSO-graph.pdf](https://www.baratza.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/VIRTUOSO-graph.pdf) from which I picked Modal Particle Size (perhaps mean, or adjusted mean is more useful than peak).\n* Hario data is from: [https://howchoo.com/coffee/how-to-adjust-your-hario-mini-mill-coffee-grinder](https://howchoo.com/coffee/how-to-adjust-your-hario-mini-mill-coffee-grinder) however it is *Name of Grind Size* based, not 𝜇m based, I chose the middle value of Kruve's named ranges which is somewhat arbitrary.\n* Interpolated values are in parenthesizes.\n\n|Kruve Brewler Particle Size 𝜇m|Kruve Brewler Name of Size|Hario Mini Mill Clicks|Baratza Virtuoso Dial Setting|etc|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|200|Fine||||\n|300|Fine||||\n|400|Fine||8||\n|500|Medium-Fine||(11)||\n|600|Medium-Fine|8|(14)||\n|700|Medium-Fine||(17)||\n|(750)|my AeroPress|9|(18-19)||\n|800|Medium||20||\n|900|Medium|10|(23)||\n|1000|Medium||(26)||\n|1100|Medium Coarse||(29)||\n|1200|Medium Coarse|12|(32)||\n|1300|Medium Coarse||(35)||\n|1400|Coarse||(38)||\n|1500|Coarse||40||\n|1600|Coarse||(43)||",

I have a very basic grinder, Hario Skerton (yes I've already noticed grind is pretty inconsistent, will probably upgrade soon).\n\nTo learn about effect of diff. grind sizes, I made the same Sidamo ethiopian with 3 grind sizes. Each cup with 6g of freshly ground beans, 100ml boiling water on top. Wait about 4min, remove crust then wait another few minutes.\n\nThe test was super interesting, I could really feel how the finer grind gave a more bitter, astringent taste. And the coarser one had way more acidity!\n\nI'd like to keep doing these tests, maybe with even more cups per test, but every time it's a lot of coffee to drink by myself (I'm quite sensitive to caffeine). Can I go lower than 6g per cup &amp; still get good results? How do you guys go about it?\n\nAny tips &amp; experience is appreciated!",

Yes it doesn't taste as strong and you do not get as much caffiene but I think that is actually not necesarily bad. Rebrewing coffee gives a much lighter, tea like color and taste(kinda tastes like diner coffee) and I think that the lower caffiene content allows you to drink coffee later in the day without upsetting your circadian rythm. You can also brew it in tea without overpowering the flavor of tea.\n\nTL;DR Rebrewing coffee is like making a coffee flavored tea and its lower caffiene content allows you to drink coffee later in the day without ruining your sleep cycle.",

I never thought I liked it until I had a decent cup.  Now I am trying to learn as much as possible.  My first cup that I enjoyed was from a coffee shop that used Lavazza.  I use Lavazza Classico medium roast (still ground, haven't gotten to the point of grinding my own yet, but soon) with a Bodum pour over maker that I drink black.  I enjoy it very much, and would like to have a second cup but the caffeine is a bit much with the second cup (I stopped caffeine when my wife got pregnant 26 years ago).  At my local Wallyworld the only decaf that I could find with a medium roast was Dunkin, and these two are completely different.  I prefer the Lavazza.  It seems that Lavazza doesn't make a ground decaf medium.  I don't want to spend $30 on a bag of coffee, but a mid-priced brew would be ok.  Any suggestions for a good ground decaf?",

Yet recently bought two packs of \"Karnataka Malabar AA\" and \"Moka Lekempti Kombawa G4\" (I read what is written on the pack) Two tasty coffees yet my machine cannot make anymore espresso after the first two. \n\nI think because the seller offered to grind one at 2 and the other one 2.5 after I told him about my machine. And the grain seems too fine for the Krups filter. I tried to boil the filter, and boil it again with vinegar. It seems it kinda unblocked as water could flow through when used without coffee (yet making a strange pressure noise sometimes)\n\nI bought another blend and ask them for a 5 ground this time and it still doesn't go through. Then tried the coffee from supermarket which I have learnt is ground between 5 and 8. But still no luck. (As this one never create any problem in the past)\n\nSo do you think I need to buy another filter ? \n\nThough one question : when buying my machine I never heard of the machine not accepting finest grounds. Even now when browsing an online shop, machines don't mention how fine should the coffeee be ground. \n\nThe seller from the shop told me they sell a machine that can accept coffee ground at 0. (but it costs €2500) And their professional machines can even use coffee ground bellow 0 (??) and for this purpose they even use a different grinder than the one they used my coffee on..",
