I know that Min-Nan, Manderin, Hakka, Many Formosan languages, &amp; Yani on a small island in the south. I was wondering if anyone could sheld some light on these languages. Their use, what makes them unique (especially the sinitic languages), their legal definitions (if they're offical/protected/taught in schools/etc). Really, any information about them. Written too of course. If Hakka &amp; min write differently from Mandarin just like colloquial Cantonese does. Thanks! ",

Turkish is highly agglutinative (and also highly regular), but definitely has millions of speakers and has a history of there being a lot of adult learners. After all, much of Anatolia had previously spoken completely unrelated languages (such as Greek) before switching over to Turkish. Of course, some of the switching resulted from mixing and family relations which would have involved children learning, there were undoubtedly a lot of adults learning the language, too, as it had become the prestige language in a fairly sizable area for centuries.\n\nWhy would Turkish have not become analytic? Perhaps because of the high level of regularity? Or is this hypothesis still questionable?",

But in it I presented previous data and cited that AmE used to prefer **\"different than\"** more than BrE. Thus I identified this prepositional phrase as typically American. Which is my starting point right? How would I know the identity of this prepositional phrase?\n\nThus , I collected **recent data (2012-2016)** on those prepositional phrases from COCA and SPOKENBNC (two corpora for AmE and BrE). They showed that AmE favors **\"different than\"** more than BrE and that it's been losing popularity (decreasing frequency) in BrE.\n\nThese findings tell the same like previous research with the exception of BrE showing a decreasing frequency.\n\nMy question is, do I compare the recent data on BrE to previous data on AmE or recent data from (2012-2016)? What's the use of comparing recent data to recent data? The recent data on AmE do not answer the central question. They only answer if AmE has changed too.\n\nI am confused as to what I should do with previous and recent data on AmE and BrE.\n\nI can't think clearly. Please give me a hint.\n\n‚Äã\n\n‚Äã\n\n‚Äã",
