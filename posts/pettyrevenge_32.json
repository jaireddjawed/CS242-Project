        "text": "I live in the upper Midwest and as most people that watch the weather know we have had a significant amount of snow fall starting Thursday and where I am is expected to continue through tomorrow.\n\nOne of my neighbors (I'm not certain who, otherwise I would have spoken to them,) has been parking closer to my driveway then allowed by the ordinances of the city we live in (ordinance says no closer than 3 feet of the curb line change.) During the summer no big deal, sometimes it was difficult to get enough space to get my trash and recycle out to the road and still have room to get out of the driveway but I made it work.\n\nBecause I know we get large amounts of heavy snow I put a reflector in the right of way so I know about where a smallish sapling is so I make sure to not pile up the chunks of road ice and I figured I would be helpful to people parking on the road and put it at the 3 foot mark.\n\nFriday morning after over a foot of snow has fallen I head out to go to work and this car is well passed the 3 foot mark, in fact their front tire is passed the 3 foot mark. Another neighbor has parked across the street and because I have a very narrow street it makes for a fun time getting my car out.\n\nAt work I decide that if I can't figure out who they are I will have to report them to get a ticket using my city's online app. My day passes and when I get home the car has not moved. I check the app and nothing has been noted.\n\nThis morning I get up early because I have to clear all the snow from my sidewalk before someone decides to report it as not cleared, (another ordinance thing,) and low and behold they still have not moved. This means the plows can't get near enough to my curb to clear some of the snow so I am left with half the street in front of my driveway not cleared of any snow. Well I want to be able to get out of my driveway without getting stuck so that snow has to go somewhere and I am not walking it all around that car to get it into the right of way, so I just shoveled it all right up against the front of the car and driver's side door of their car.\n\nAs of right now there is another car parked behind them so I don't think they will be able to back away to get around it.",

        "text": "One day about 13 years ago, my uncle (m62 now) stopped talking to me (f38 now) and I was absolutely dumbfounded and clueless as to why. We used to communicate multiple times a week and were very close.  This was next-level silent treatment and uncomfortable during family encounters, confusing everyone. Then about 3 years later, I found out from his adult children that the reason he stopped talking to me was because I salted a basket of chips at a restaurant and he was on a low salt diet due to a medical condition (mind you that he hid from everyone but I was expected to be a mind reader). The crime was that I am ‚Äúnot a thoughtful person‚Äù because I allegedly  salted the chips on purpose in his eyes. The real unfortunate aspect about this was that 1) had I known about his condition I would not have salted the chips and 2) had he indicated he couldn‚Äôt have salt on them after I salted them (they came out fresh and unsalted), I would have gotten up and gone and asked for a new basket of chips for him. Unfortunately the punishment did not fit the crime and I got the grade A silent treatment for 3 years. We finally made up but didn‚Äôt discuss the event (until about a year ago and that is a great story for probably another community). However, he is the king of petty revenge so it is only appropriate that he receives just punishment as well. One of his favorite rants in life is being stuck on group texts when the convo should be between just two people. I decided I‚Äôd slow launch a group text hijack campaign and take it up a notch by strategically throwing him on group threads that contain at least one Android user so that he is not able to leave the conversation. I‚Äôve been doing this several times a year for a solid 10 years and going strong, I think it may actually be habitual now. Not a thing he can do to stop it and he has no idea that it is a consequence of his actions. ‚ÄúWho salted the chips‚Äù is also now the family joke that he gets to relive. If he‚Äôs mad at something, someone says, ‚Äúwhat did they do, salt the chips?‚Äù \n\nTLDR: My uncle gave me the silent treatment for 3 years for salting chips so I get him back by putting him on group text messages with Androids so he is stuck and can‚Äôt leave the convo (one of his biggest pet peeves).",

Carpark is already full, so they park in front of the front door to check in, blocking other vehicles in.\n\nCheck in is non eventful. I rattle of my spiel and hand the guest her keys.\n\nGuest walks off, then stops all of a sudden. As she turns to face me again, I know that she is about to complain about something. We all know the pose. Eyes widen as they ready themselves to plead their case as the point and wiggle their index finger in the air at shoulder height.\n\nGame on.\n\nGuest: You need more parking spots, there is not enough for 40 rooms. Your carpark is already full. I reserved a space. \n\nMe: I'm sorry Ma'am, but our parking is on a first come, first served basis. We do not reserve spaces. If the car park is full, all of the on street parking is free. \n\nHer: Well there should be 40 spaces for all 40 rooms. \n\nSide note. We have 12 spaces at the front of our property which stretches from the street to our front entrance. Local council regulations state that we only need 1 space per 4 rooms. We beat those regs by 2. üòÇ\n\nMe: I understand your frustrations, Mrs Nitpicker, but our plans to construct an underground parking garage has been delayed due to the covid induced shovel shortage. Not a shovel to be found within 100kms. It should be dug out and fully operational by the time our City hosts the Olympics in 2032 though.\n\nHer: You should extend your carpark until then so everyone room has an assigned space. I think we should be given a discount for no parking.\n\nMe:. The owner did consider  just knocking this place down completely and making it into a public carpark, but then he realised that we would have no rooms left for our guests which would lower our property rating, so we decided to keep things as they are for the time being.\n\nHer: And the discount I asked for?\n\n*I type away furiously, whilst umming and ahhing for dramatic effect* \n\nMe: I have applied the discount to your folio. I have calculated the total amount it will cost you to park on the street for your 7 day stay and have deducted that amount from your bill. Is there anything else I can help you with, Ma'am?\n\nHer: *Huff's and gives me a smug smile* Well I should think so.\n\nGuest walks off.\n\nAs I stated earlier street parking is free 24/7. Her total discount was $0.00. \n\nShe never noticed.",

        "text": "I'm sure you can all see where this story is going from the title but let me paint you a picture as this happened not but an hour ago on my way home from work.\n\nPopped into a supermarket on the way home for food as we have nothing in and as I positioned myself to back into a space, I noticed a tiny car park space where not 1 but 2 cars had taken it upon themselves to park overhanging their lines so as to deter people from parking next to their precious vehicles.\n\nWell, for most people, they would have chuntered something about terrible parking and moved on with their lives. Not me! I drive a relatively small car, coincidentally, the perfect size to fit in between the 2 cars with I kid you not, not a cm (less than an inch for my friends across the pond) to spare on either side.\n\nIt took me a solid couple of minutes to inch my way into the space so as not to touch either vehicle but I eventually got myself in. Now being quite slim and relatively flexible, I was able to climb out of my window, onto my roof and slide down the back of my car.\n\nFeeling happy with myself I queued up to pay for my items hoping the bad parkers had gotten their just desserts. That's when I saw them! Through the window by the checkouts the occupants of both vehicles were pacing around theirs and my vehicle, occasionally throwing their hands in the air. 1 couple and 1 family trying to figure out how to get into their cars. This is where some of you may call me the asshole and that I should've just found a different spot. To that I say, just a couple of spaces along were designated family kid friendly spots with extra room for those with kids. \n\nGrinning from ear to ear I watch as the father of the family is able to back his car out to let the rest of the family in meanwhile the other vehicle had their drivers side millimetres away from my passenger side.\n\nAfter paying I hastily walk out so as not to miss anything (and to make sure no car keying takes place) and the woman of the couple, apparently the driver is yelling at her partner about how she is going to get in and who would park so close to her when there are loads of other spots!\n\nI walk closer to my car and she clocks that I am the person causing her all of this stress. Trying to hide my Cheshire smile she starts trying to give me shit about parking so close when I reply that I am within my lines, it is you that is close to me.\n\nThe man of the couple has been silent as I believe he is secretly on my side and is trying to calm the woman down.\n\n\"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET IN!\" She exclaims.\n\nShe was a plus sized woman and had no hope of crawling over the passenger seat let alone through the boot (Trunk for my American friends).\n\n\"I have no idea but try parking with consideration for others next time and maybe you won't find yourself in the predicament again.\" I replied. \n\nWith that I hopped in my now easy to access drivers side with the intention of driving away however my phone rang and it was a call I genuinely had to take, perfect timing nonetheless. I sat there talking to a colleague as she started yelling at her man about how he should do something. He continued to try to calm her down and my call ended. I felt like I had had my fun and inched my way back out of the spot. I felt like staying there for longer but it's Friday and I want to get home too.\n\nFor some this is nothing but for me who is very non-confrontational I found this a very satisfying way to get my point across to these entitled drivers. Road rage is dangerous and irresponsible so I find this to be a good alternative.",

I immediately realise I might have been lied to. Normally I dont drink (huge light weight) but since this was a special occasion I had made some plans. So my aunt enters the hall to greet my mom while I reach into my backpack and walk into the living room and crack one out of two 12% Viking beer I specialordered for me and my uncle (he likes weird beer) and we start drinking. About three minutes later my  aunt sees the can and starts screaming at me for drinking while watching the kids (I only hear distant screaming). \n\nI repeat my moms promise and she calls me the R word when they are clearly staying here. So I reach out my hand and say 200 bucks for emergency babysitting and I wont finish this beer. She says h*** no so I chug the half litre can to the loud cheers and laughs from my dad and uncle. When I'm done I say \"birth happy day mommy sister\" with a burp. With my mom just looking hugely embarrassed for my aunt. My designated driver dad ends up watching them the entire night instead, I think he might schedule a vasectomy soon.",

M had a boyfriend who she cheated on during the same birthday party. M also has a reputation for sleeping around with anything with a heartbeat at university. She enrolled in a PhD and the joke was that she did it to get with a fresh batch of dudes. All the power to her.\n\nTowards the end of my Masters I got to know that my ex, who we'll call F, during THAT time and M had kissed while we were still dating. I didn't know that during the time and was surprised when F broke up with me. It was months later that I accidentally got to know about it.\n\nLast weekend M and my current BF J went to Paris to party with a friend from our uni. I didn't have a problem because I knew about it for months. But while they were in Paris M posted extremely flirty pictures of J and J was posting cutesy, flirty insta stories of M calling her a potato. J also goes ahead and posts an extremely long and flirty comment under Ms picture calling her a happy potato. I was so sick and heartbroken that I unfollowed M on Instagram.\n\nJ doesn't like me even taking a pic of the two of us together and had only told M and another friend that we were seeing each other. \n\nI took my time to think through rationally and told J that I didn't appreciate how J and M were flirting for the world to see especially given M knows that we are together. J said it wasn't flirty and that M is just a friend. we are still arguing about it. \n\nBut the person I'm mad at is M because this is the second time she's taking someone I like away from me. So I did the pettiest thing I could do. I changed her contact name to \"The Great Whore of C\" C being the university I did my masters. And honestly I feel better for it.",

I was told it was some sort of infection and put on antibiotics.\n\n Once when the Dr came to examine me he did so without an accompanying nurse and while i was alone in the room. He looked at my booods and said inbound need to stay in a bit longer. I asked him what was actually wrong with me as no-one had explained this to me. He then went on a tirade that went something like this.. \n\n\"ever sinse you came in here you've been acting as if you're never going to go home, you've been causing problems and making a fuss.\"\n Me: \"sorry but thats quite a personal attack I dont think it's right for you to talk to me like that\". \nHim:\" It's not just me who thinks so, everyone has been sayig it. the nurses have been saying it too. There is nothing seriously wrong with you. There is never anything seriously wrong with young women\". \n\nHe left me in tears. A nurse came in later and I told her what happened. She seemed genuinely confused and said she had no idea what he was talking about... honestly I belve her because I'd got on really well with all the nurses and staff and had been so greatful.for all the cate and help. I'm not a complainer or a confrontational person so it was really bizarre to me. My parents requested i move to a different Dr which we were. My parents were told that the original Dr said he had \"washed his hands of this\". The nurse told us we should make a formal complaint and that she would make her own complaint, but we never did. \n\nYears later Im still baffled. I dont really like being seen by male Dr's anymore. Now that I'm older and a health care professional myself i realise he was a misogynist and completely unprofessional even if i had been a pain in the arse. Anyway, it occurred to me I could look this guy up and I found him on Google at a different hospital with a page to submit a request for treatment by him. I'm sooooo tempted to leave some sort of angry message to him but its probably pointless and petty to do so! What would you do?",

On the days I'm feeling extra overstimulated I lock the bathroom door because my husband always comes in to talk to me. He decided to ignore the locked door and unlock it from the outside with a paper clip because he can't handle following rules or being told no. I was really annoyed by this so the past three days I've been unlocking his bathroom door while he's showering but not going in. Ever since we moved in together he locks the bathroom door every time he uses it so I know he knows he didn't forget to lock it. He hasn't said anything about it yet but it's really satisfying to hear him accidentally lock the door when he thinks he's unlocking it when he leaves the bathroom. I will continue to do this until feel vindicated or he suspects me. It's the little things sometimes that bring me joy in this sleep-deprived season of my life.",

        "text": "In writing this post, I‚Äôm also hoping from some perspective from older and wiser as to whether I did something wrong. I‚Äôm (21 F) now a senior and I live with my freshman roommate/best friend, Cece (22F) in an apartment with 2 other friends. Cece and I are a three person friend group with another person let‚Äôs call her Jess (23F) since freshman year. \n\nCece started dating Winston sophomore 23M and he‚Äôs over ALL THE TIME. He has his plants in our apartment and asked me not to open windows so they don‚Äôt get cold and die (despite the fact that he has his own apartment and we‚Äôve never discussed him keeping his plants here). Winston, Cece, Jess and I are friends. \n\nThis year I‚Äôve been branching out becauseI felt like Cece, I and Jess could get toxic. For example : I‚Äôm an English major and they‚Äôre all STEM majors and sometimes when I want to discuss things from class I feel looked down on bc of comments like ‚Äògo trauma dump‚Äô or ‚Äòdaddy issues‚Äô. This year, I‚Äôve made about new friends from class who I hang out with. \n\nFor the incident in question : I have a 7 pm class that goes till 10 pm and is a fucking pain and my (new) friends and I pregame it at my house. When I say pregame, I don‚Äôt mean a party I mean 2 people coming over taking 4 shots in a span of 30 minutes and leaving. It‚Äôs once a week &amp; I clean every glass before I leave. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on one of these pregames I could see that Cece didn‚Äôt seem like she was having the best time and I texted her after to ask and she said she was hungry so she wasn‚Äôt super interactive but it‚Äôs all good. \n\nKeeping this in mind, I messaged her before this week‚Äôs pregame word for word me: Is it alright if 3 people come over before class? Cece : yes Me : are you absolutely sure? Cece : yes don‚Äôt worry. \nThey arrive half an hour before class and we‚Äôre standing in the kitchen and Cece is making dinner for herself and her boyfriend and honestly, I‚Äôm not looking at her. We drink for half an hour and leave to class. The next day, I just get a feeling something‚Äôs off and I text her asking if she‚Äôs mad. She says yes. \n\nThe next day, she says she felt like it got a loud and crowded and they were standing in her way to the fridge and Winston had an exam and she had to cook for him so he could eat fast. I said sorry that was that. I told her I would be hosting no more pregames at our place and 100% meant it and honestly if she‚Äôd told me at any point that she didn‚Äôt like people coming over, I would‚Äôve responded in a manner respectful of her space. \n\nIn my mind, I felt rlly bad because she said she expected better from me as her best friend and I should‚Äôve noticed her facial expressions. She said I should‚Äôve asked my friends to move [she could‚Äôve asked them to move (she didn‚Äôt)]. But also, He is a guest and this is my home. His needs or wants don‚Äôt take ANY precedence over my guests. Her guests don‚Äôt take precedence over mine. Go fucking cook at his house (which is his alone). This happened a week ago but I find out from Jess that she went to hers after I left to rant about me and Jess told me she told Cece she thought I was an alcoholic. \n\nNow I‚Äôm starting to get a little upset a week later because I feel like they‚Äôve been talking behind my back. I feel like it stems from slight jealousy that they‚Äôre not my only friends anymore like they‚Äôve been for three years and if they were really concerned about my substance use why not TELL ME? The thing about Winston plant stuck in my head and i told my other housemates about it and they have similar issues with him. One of them jokingly suggested that because were all Asian and he‚Äôs white we should make the house swelteringly hot but still not open the window. Winston also runs much hotter than us and it‚Äôs winter. I laughed but the next day I was like why not. We‚Äôre all used to the heat he‚Äôs not. I went and turned the temperature aaalllll the way up to 80 degrees F and checked with my other housemates if they were okay with it. They just laughed and told me it was fully fine and we‚Äôve all just been wearing tank tops around the house. He asked us to crack open a window and we said nope the plant will die and he looked SO CRESTFALLEN and idk if I‚Äôm a crappy person but that made me happy",

You won't be able to charge yours too.\n\nI [28, F] is fed up with my husband [32, M] unplugging  my phone whenever I'm charging.\n\nI have to use a throwaway account because he's on reddit too. Him and I have the same type of charger so sometimes, I would use his and vice versa. Annoyingly, whenever I would charge my phone and he needed to charge his phone too he would remove mine and plug his in (regardless of whose charger I'm using). He's too lazy to get a different charger.\n\nIt was fine at first as it wasn't really a big deal, BUT there were times that he would do this when I really needed to have my phone fully charged. Example, I had it charging before I took a bath because I needed it full for a phone call I was expecting only to find it unplugged and was low battery when I was done. I called him out about this and he would make excuses like \" I would plug it back after\" or \"You aren't gonna use your phone anyway\" which I don't give a fuck anymore cause I was just done by his BS about it. It's been going on since we started having the same charger type (I think it was mid July or Early August something like that.)\n\nAnd since I got tired of calling him out, I would now unplug his phone without it looking like it was unplugged. You know what I mean? Like on the charging port, I would still insert it but shallow enough for it not charge. Or sometimes I would loosen the plug on the socket to make it look like he didn't insert it enough.\n\nI don't do this on a regular so he wouldn't catch on. Like today :) I had just charged my phone, I'm currently on 37% when he unplugged my phone right infront of me and when I called him out he gave me another lame excuse. So I let him, I took another charger then I loosen the plug on his phone.\n\nI'm almost fully charged and his phone is about to die and he doesn't know because he's taking a bath. He'll be surprise once his done.\n\nI'll wait for his reaction. If you won't listen to me when I'm being reasonable then I'mma be petty.",

        "text": "We live in a new and small apartment complex, only 40 units within 2 buildings. It's very low-key and within walking distance to our downtown. It's very affordable for how convenient a location it is.\n\nBack in September we noticed the vacant unit beside us was getting moved into by a new tenant with furniture, decor, etc. One weekend not long after moving in we heard what sounded like a little party with music and loud voices well past midnight. We heard a lot of people coming in and out of the front door, but letting the door slam each time to where it shook the walls. Maybe they were having a house warming party or a friend's get together at the new place. So we brushed it under the rug as a one-off incident.\n\nFor the next few weeks we noticed a variety of people coming in and out of this apartment and none of them seemed to be the same individuals. Parking also started to become much more busy than usual as well as the cars kept changing. So, something seemed off.\n\nMy GF started working night shift for her job not long after the neighboring apartment became occupied. She is a light sleeper and noticed that all throughout the morning and before going to work the neighbor's door was always slamming and shaking the walls. She understands that people are active in the day and she can't ask people to cater to her night shift needs, but she felt the constant slamming of doors was not only disruptive, but unusual behavior. \n\nOne particular morning was the straw that broke the camel's back. She had finally had enough because of the effect it was having on her sleep. She wanted to see who was slamming the door. She heard the door slamming around 1030 am and got up and witnessed people walking to their car with suitcases and leaving. Soon after a man arrived and pulled up the front doormat and retrieved a key and let two women with cleaning supplies into the apartment. Each time they entered or left the door would *SLAM* and shake the wall.  \n\nSeeing this she searched Airbnb and almost immediately found the rental unit next door. Same floor plans, wall paint, flooring, etc. To our surprise and anger we found a total of *FOUR* listings in our apartment complex alone on the host's profile. That is 10% of the apartments in our buildings. \n\nThrough the listings we found the individual's LinkedIn and business website. On his website he claims that he does something called \"retal arbitrage\". Essentially this is renting out a long term rental on short term basis (lease an apartment and rent it on Airbnb for profit). This can be done legally with the landlord's permission. The lease agreement does not allow for sub-lettng or short term rentals. \n\nThey were renting out 3 of the 4 ground end units offered (units with unique floorplans). The 4th unit was a handicap accessible unit. That's right. This man and his business partner leased an apartment meant for accommodating people with disabilities with the intention of using it for his little short term business empire he was trying to build. Our city and region (like in other places) has been feeling the squeeze on apartment availability and these dickheads are contributing to the problem. \n\nIt was at this point we took this personally as we had our own problems dealing with apartment availability, wait-lists, disappointment, and frustration. My GF called the leasing office and notified them that the neighboring unit is being rented out on Airbnb and asked if that was allowed to which the office gave an emphatic \"absolutely not\" and asked for the listings to be sent to them in an email. Later that day the office called her back and said they notified the \"tenant\" that they will be inspecting the apartments the following afternoon. \n\nAfter the inspection was completed the office notified that they had sent a cease and desist docent of any rental activities outside the lease agreement or face eviction. They also informed us that \"you should not have anymore problems concerning the matter and if you do, don't hesitate to give us a call :)\".\n\nNow, this asshole has four leases he is stuck paying $1500/month for and can't make anymore money on through Airbnb. He is bleeding money at the tune of about $6000/month. His only legal options are to continue paying for them or to break the leases and vacate. Last week we watched as movers emptied out the apartments. \n\nDon't be dickheads, folks. Also, don't piss off a night shifter trying to sleep.",

When I was in 5th grade she booted my grandpa out of his house and put him in old folks home and sold his house since she is a real estate agent, this move caused me to lose most of my friends, so throughout most of high school, I've relied on the internet for most of the social interactions I've had. My aunt and cousins live with us since they were evicted from their rental home, and even they said the internet kicks them out constantly, I explained this to my mom and she said she didn't care and wouldn't even have internet if I didn't live there and if I wanted better internet I could pay for it myself. So a few months later she had this important call and needed to use her computer, the router is conveniently right next to my chair where I use my computer, I waited for her to get on the call and unplugged it, she quickly grabbed her laptop darted out of the house got in her car and sped off and used her phone personal hot spot instead.",

I didn't have a problem with that until one of them tried to kiss me in my sleep. It was so disappointing. I decided to stay away from him. Then he abused the friend he was sleeping with infront of my eyes. It just triggered me. It reminded me of all my childhood trauma, having seen my mom being abused like that. I just decided to keep tabs on the victim because she really didn't deserve the way he was treating her. Then i find out that she was dishing up dirt about me and making up rumours about me to please him. That was my final straw. So my revenge: I stayed away from them. I stopped moderating their behaviours to encourage peace. I just let them have a rip at each other on their own. And they broke up. I didn't think staying away from them would break them up, but it did. My not being present actually ruined the relationship and the guy acknowledged that. It was so strange. So i wanted to see if that's true. So i brought them back together. Then stayed away from them again and they broke up again. It was so weird. It was almost addictive. I wanted to do it again, but the way they broke up this time, it was forever. Their relationship couldn't work without my intervention. So i kept staying away. So where does the kindness come in? Well, i noticed after their last break up, the girl got worse with spreading her rumours so i started speaking well of both of them in public. It made them look like utter a**holes. Why would you expose someone's personal business that has nothing to do with the other person's issues, especially someone who has been so nice and kind to you. It just ruined the reputation entirely. I just didn't think being kind to people would do that. It's so addictive. So i tried it with someone else who's been pissing me off lately, and it worked. When they say \"K*** them with kindness\", they really weren't kidding. It's an effective method. Don't go dirty, go clean and the dirt within them will start to be revealed.",

        "text": "Years ago when my husband and I got married we had a decent sized wedding (100+ people) that we paid for ourselves.  Because we were still fairly young and not making a ton of money I tried to save where I could.  \n\nI hired local people and friends to do many things at a discounted price and because I worked at a 4 star restaurant/banquet facility I was able to talk them into doing the wedding reception for cost as long as I provided a, b, and c.  Basically we had an amazing wedding for a very low price, however, it was still a fairly large amount per person.  Somewhere between 17-20 per plate.  Not too bad, but not cheap.\n\nAnyways, the invites go out and after a bit the rsvp cards start to pour in and, like I said, we ended up with over 100+ people (maybe almost 130) that would be attending.  My aunt was one of those people.  She rsvp‚Äôd for her, her husband, and their son - my cousin.\n\nWedding day comes, we get married, reception time and my aunt (and family) is a no show.  I notice because I only have two.  I‚Äôm irritated, but more worried something may have happened.  However, the following Monday I get a card in the mail from them with a check for $10.00!  No apology, just signed with a small congrats statement.  Nothing personal.  I was so disappointed.\n\nSo, I call her mother (hahaha) my grandma and I tell her what happened.  She instantly says ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt even cover the cost of the meals she wasted when she didn‚Äôt show up!  What a cheap skate!‚Äù  It hadn‚Äôt even crossed my mind at the time.  Then she says the best thing ever. ‚Äúyou know,  your aunt is super ocd about her checkbook.  Don‚Äôt cash that check.  It‚Äôll drive her mad.‚Äù\n\nI didn‚Äôt and it did!  \n\nIt also drove my narcissistic mother crazy because she got all the calls asking when I was going to cash the check.  Guess she was too embarrassed by then to call me.  A win, win!\n\nThe BEST part is I kept the check and left it inside the card.  I have a habit of keeping all my cards and every once in a while I‚Äôll pull that card out and look at that check and it always makes me feel like the pettiest bitch alive.",

        "text": "Back in college I took a WWII history class. Barely. I'm a history buff so I thought it would be a great class. Boy was I wrong. \n\nThe professor's entire career had been spent teaching as a civilian on military bases. He always wore a suit jacket adorned with a bunch of military medals and hats you generally see veterans of various conflicts wearing (think baseball cap with \"Operation Desert Storm, Veteran\" on them). He was never in the military, he claimed his medals were gifts from his former students who were so grateful for his teaching. \n\nI can only imagine they were grateful because they didn't actually have to do anything in class. \n\nWhen he started at the college (first time the old fart had a non-military base job) he structured his class as such: We met twice a week. The first meeting he put up a handwritten slide with topics he would cover that day. He then went on a meandering nonsensical explanation of those topics (honestly, think like a Trump speech) full of misrepresentations, innaccuracies and conjecture sprinkled with a lot of his own modern political opinions presented as fact.\n\nThe second meeting of the week we watched a WWII movie. No discussion of the film or the accuracy, or the actual events in the movie. No report to be done. Just like, watch Saving Private Ryan and appreciate it for being a good movie. Our final was to find a WWII movie we didn't already see in class and write a one page summary of the film. No analysis mind you, just a description of the movie. \n\nAs a university level class, this was a complete joke. \n\nThe professor didn't like me because I often corrected him in class. Like \"no sir WWII didn't start at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the war had been raging for years by then.\" Well not in AMERICA which is what MATTERS. \n\nHe also had a tendency like at least once a class of making the observation that X person is \"the new Hitler.\" Foreign leaders that critisized Israeli policies? Hitler. Obama? Hitler. Pelosi? Hitler. He once called David Beckham the new Hitler. (like dafuq?) I tended to call him on these statements. He didn't like it. \n\nOne day Prof says that next class he'll be performing a one man show he wrote about Eisenhower's D-Day decision. He warned us not to be late because one simply doesn't do that in the theater (his classroom).\n\nI was the editor of the school paper and on the way to that class the president of the college stopped me out in the hall to discuss something I'd been trying to get a meeting about. This caused me to be five minutes late to class. I was never usually late but when the head of the school wants to chat, you do it. \n\nProf flipped his Eisenhower-hat-wearing lid when I walked in late. He screamed about how rude I was to interrupt his performance, and said he was going to fail me and leave. I argued back that that was not fair and he can't fail me for being late to class one time. Especially since there was no such policy stated in the syllabus... because this idiot didn't even make a syllabus. \n\nHe said if I didn't leave right then he'd go to the dean of the department and get me kicked out of school. \n\nFine. \n\nSo I went to the dean. I explained the whole situation- his class structure, presenting opinion as fact, racist descriptions of the Japanese, everything. The dean was particularly shocked that we watched a movie every week. I was obviously not kicked out of school and allowed to return to the next session of class. At least I dodged the bullet of seeing his one man show. \n\nProf suddenly had other history professors in every class as observers. They tried some couching but by the end of the semester the guy was fired for utter incompetence. He claimed it was a free speech in the classroom issue and somehow he even got interviewed for a segment on Fox News. He tried to take the school to court, where his ass got shut down hard. \n\nGuess the student taught the professor the lesson in this case.",

        "text": "Title - I'm a college student and when I first came to the school a year ago I was a fucking wreck. My self-esteem was in the garbage and my social anxiety was at an all time high. I moved to a neighborhood about three miles from campus and interacted with a largely online community, largely because of my job and the commute.\n\nI'm a gay male and I rebounded on one of the moderators on the chat we were using - we will call him \"Spacerat.\" He looks exactly as he sounds, smarmy and unkempt. In other words, great for a depressed and lonely gay looking to let just *anyone* in. We all have bad taste sometimes, right? \n\nWithout being super long-winded, I flirted with him, and he flirted back. There was a certain channel of doing this anonymously - and I noticed he would wait for every new message, but when I would follow through directly, he would leave me on read. Two things became clear after a month or so of doing this - a). he knew it was me, and b). was treating my sexuality as a tool to boost his ego. \n\nI called him out on it. To make a long story *very* short*,* I was ousted from their group, and banned from any and all future meetups. Admin said it was going to last for a month, and as of writing this almost a *year* later, that ban still hasn't been lifted. Spacerat went on and said, in a post that took way more effort than it would have had he just said \"I'm not into you\" -  \"what gave you this impression that I was gay?\" üôÑ\n\nNow, Spacerat, as lovely a persona as he is, isn't the abuser I'm referencing in the title. That stigma belongs to another *gay* person we'll dub \"Tweaker.\" \n\nTweaker spent almost all of December basically making me think I was the root cause of all drama on the server, that Spacerat didn't *mean* it that way, that it was just because of my past, that I was this crazy, melodramatic psycho in need of therapy, bla bla bla you get it. Classic gaslighting. Basically if I shut up about it there will be no more issues and we can all move on and be this big happy family again. Really? \n\nTo add insult to injury, as I was living through this abuse, I had a breakdown at work which caused me to be *fired -* on my 23rd birthday no less - and forced me to cancel my trip back home. So my birthday, christmas, and new years - all ruined. You can imagine what this is doing to my mental health. \n\nFast-forward a year and life's turned on a dime. I end up moving to a new apartment close to the school. I'm working out, losing weight; I get my school paid off through aid, my skins better, my confidence is up. And I try my hardest to just put my past behind me. \n\nWell after church I meet this new person we'll call \"Kelly.\" Kelly invites me to this political action club at school and sends me the invite to their server. I take it, and as I'm scrolling through the member list, looking for people I recognize, guess who I come across? Tweaker. \n\nThe memories just flood back. I tell her what's going on and Kelly doesn't doubt my experiences for a *second.* she tells me that she can have Tweaker removed - she's friends with the admins of this server and they're on a good understanding. We talk some more about this over a couple of beers, and I prepare a statement, which she then shares with admin. A week later, and he's gone. No more fear. \n\nWhat's even more satisfying is that she tells me when the admins, who typically don't ban people over the slightest transgression, ban someone, they add a message telling them why and poking fun at them simultaneously. In my message, I revealed some pretty *damning* things I knew about Tweaker's past - including the time in high school - he admitted this early on - that he was supposedly ostracized from his friend group because his boyfriend allegedly lied that Tweaker raped him. Tweaker deleted this message when he sent it, which is pretty sus behavior around a lie. The political group's admin likely mentioned this in the ban message.\n\nA few days after this happened, I ran into tweaker on the streets and he tried to block my passage. He looked inconsolable. By doing this, I not only got back at Tweaker, but I sent a message to Spacerat as well, that my story will be believed and their reputation will suffer. \n\nTL;DR - Crush's friend emotionally abused and gaslit me for a month over being manipulated and ostracized. A year later, I ruined his reputation and got him kicked out of a key political action group on campus.",

        "text": "This is a very small petty revenge, but oooh is it sweet for me, and hopefully some of you! There is almost nothing more annoying than someone who purposefully parks their car like a douche nozzle. I just so happen to have a coworker who's family member is one such specimen.\n\nTiny background info: my coworker gets rides from two different family members, Granny and Grumpy, depending on Granny's work schedule. This focuses of course on Grumpy, since Granny is nice enough to park correctly and even sends our shift snacks sometimes.\n\nGrumpy on the other hand believes he owns the whole parking lot, and for some reason he loooves to park next to me. I let it slide when he parked so crooked, I almost couldn't leave the lot without dinging his truck. First point. And I let it blow over when he almost rear ended me trying to go 50 in a 35, where we both had to stop at a no turn on red light. Second point. Both times I alerted my coworker to his annoying behavior, since Coworker always has his own nose in his iPad, and asked for my comments to be passed along. They were not, as far as I could tell.\n\nSo cue malicious petty revenge! Last week Grumpy once again parked next to my driver side, this time with hardly enough space for me to even get in my own car. My coworker is notorious for being the last of our shift to clock out too, so Grumpy is always in a rush to leave by the time Coworker exits the building. Knowing I had plenty of time, I threw my bag in through my passenger door, then wiggled into the car on the other side, and promptly sat there with the door open. Grumpy had parked so very close, that he couldn't back up at all without causing damage to my vehicle and his, and Coworker couldn't get into the truck at all with my door open. They both had to deal with it as I lit and enjoyed a cigarette, smoking slowly. The look on Grumpy's face was priceless and now, he parks a full space over so he can zoom out as soon as Coworker gets in his truck. And I no longer have to deal with his bullshit.",

In my condo we had assigned parking spaces. I was next to a pole on my left and another car parked on my right.\n\nI took the subway to school and only used my car on the weekends. A year into law school my park spot neighbors got a new car - a big suv. That was fine - good for them. However one week I noticed the paint on my right side was getting chipped. I assumed I must have hit something or it was hail or a rock from the highway. That was a Sunday. I didn‚Äôt drive anywhere until friday and notice the chipped spot was bigger. Becoming suspicious I looked at the edge of the door of the suv and there were flecks of red paint.\n\nI was annoyed and left them a note to contact me. The note was gone next time I was there and I was not contacted. However the chip in my car was deeper and there was more red paint on their door. \n\nI took pictures of this and brought it to the condo‚Äôs attention. They didn‚Äôt have any cameras in the garage that faced me so they weren‚Äôt willing to do anything but they gave me a traffic cone. The idea was the car door would hit the cone instead of my car. \n\nI loved the idea, but then I‚Äôd notice that the cone would be moved and my car hit. The cone was entirely in my space. You bet your ass that my petty self got a ruler to verify the cone was moved.\n\nI left them a note saying don‚Äôt move my cone. Note was gone the next day and my cone moved. Condo still wouldn‚Äôt do anything but they gave me a second cone. I took great joy in putting the cones on the ground. That worked for a while but then they started storing their bikes at the top of my space. We are allowed to store items there. I got a third cone and blocked off the top of my space.\n\nThe end result? In order for anyone on the left side of THEIR car to leave the vehicle. They either had to crawl to the other side or get out of the car before their space - move the cones and then park. \n\nI took great pleasure knowing they were inconvenienced.",

My local agencies as well as our state law enforcement agency looked into it and proved me innocent. For the past 4 years, this girl (for privacy reasons we‚Äôll call her Jane) has spread lie after lie after lie about me and made my life a living hell.\n\nPetty Revenge part:\nSo today I learned that she had made a ‚ÄúSmash or Pass‚Äù page for my school. She started posting people to it without their consent or knowledge (many of whom are my close friends). So I catch wind of this, my first idea is to investigate and see who got posted. Amongst looking into it, I learned that she posted a teacher, a teachers daughter, and my friends. My first reaction after this knowledge is to go to our school administrators and explain the situation to them with one of my friends who got posted. Administrator looked into it, she is now facing expulsion. 4 years of hell, and I finally get the slightest retribution.",

        "text": "I've lived in this apartment for just over a year and I've interacted with my neighbor 3 times. Each time it is for him to complain at me that I'm \"slamming the doors, and making the walls shake, and it's really disturbing.\"\n\nIn the first interaction, I apologized profusely, said I had no idea, said \"Oh, you should have left me a note or something, I don't want to be inconsiderate,\" said I'd be more careful, and asked if there were any other issues. He basically kept repeating \"Yeah, it just shakes the whole wall and it's really disturbing.\"¬† \n\nI was horrified that I'd committed the heinous sin of Bothering Somebody (I'm a recovering doormat), and also really confused because I don't slam doors? Ever? I didn't even realize he was talking about the front door at first, and my first thought was \"What is he talking about? All the interior doors are propped open because cat.\" \n\nI've spent WAY too much time thinking about this, and figured out that when the wind blows a certain direction, there's negative air pressure in the hallway, which pulls the front door closed with some force, unless you carefully hold the handle the entire way and make the door close quietly. The neighbor's apartment is a mirror image, so his door opens the other way and he may not realize this. It also seems to be more of a problem when I have my balcony door open.\n\nI have legitimately tried to train myself to never let the front door swing closed. You should see me on my hands and knees, dragging groceries in and sliding them across the kitchen floor, because I don't want to walk in with both hands full and let the front door slam swing behind me. \n\nBut basic human \"doing your best\" only goes so far, and there have been two more times that I forgot and he came out to complain at me. After the second interaction, I was really bothered that he still seemed to think I was \"slamming\" the door deliberately, and I left a note on his door, apologizing again, explaining about the wind thing, and reiterating that I would do my best and it wasn't intentional.\n\nThe third interaction went like this:\n\nI forgot my keys, ran back inside to get them off the counter, and allowed the door to \"slam\" shut behind me. He came out as I was locking my door.\n\nHim: You're doing it again.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, I'm doing my best.\n\nHim: It's incredibly disturbing. It makes the whole wall shake.\n\nMe: I'm doing my best. What more do you want me to do?\n\nHim: Stop slamming the door.\n\nHe went back inside and I yelled after him, \"You know it's not on purpose, right? You know it's the wind?\"\n\nI am a little oversensitive to people telling me that my best isn't good enough. My neighbor does not appreciate my efforts, so I will no longer be making any. As of yesterday, I've started letting the door swing itself closed every single time. I may even be opening my balcony door ahead of time. And I think the dog needs a few extra walks today. And whoops, looks like I forgot something from my car.\n\nHe is already upset. He's made a noise complaint to the office, but I let them know about the situation before beginning my petty revenge. As far as I can see, I'm perfectly within my rights to allow my front door to swing closed -- you know, like everybody else does -- and that's what I'll be doing until he apologizes for being an ungrateful, perfectionist jerk. Or until I move out in February.\n\nAnd on that note, it's time to talk the dog out.",

        "text": "In writing this post, I‚Äôm also hoping from some perspective from older and wiser as to whether I did something wrong. I‚Äôm (21 F) now a senior and I live with my freshman roommate/best friend, Cece (22F) in an apartment with 2 other friends. Cece and I are a three person friend group with another person let‚Äôs call her Jess (23F) since freshman year. \n\nCece started dating Winston sophomore 23M and he‚Äôs over ALL THE TIME. He has his plants in our apartment and asked me not to open windows so they don‚Äôt get cold and die (despite the fact that he has his own apartment and we‚Äôve never discussed him keeping his plants here). Winston, Cece, Jess and I are friends. \nThis year I‚Äôve been branching out becauseI felt like Cece, I and Jess could get toxic. For example : I‚Äôm an English major and they‚Äôre all STEM majors and sometimes when I want to discuss things from class I feel looked down on bc of comments like ‚Äògo trauma dump‚Äô or ‚Äòdaddy issues‚Äô. This year, I‚Äôve made about new friends from class who I hang out with. \n\nFor the incident in question : I have a 7 pm class that goes till 10 pm and is a fucking pain and my (new) friends and I pregame it at my house. When I say pregame, I don‚Äôt mean a party I mean 2 people coming over taking 4 shots in a span of 30 minutes and leaving. It‚Äôs once a week &amp; I clean every glass before I leave. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on one of these pregames I could see that Cece didn‚Äôt seem like she was having the best time and I texted her after to ask and she said she was hungry so she wasn‚Äôt super interactive but it‚Äôs all good. \n\nKeeping this in mind, I messaged her before this week‚Äôs pregame word for word me: Is it alright if 3 people come over before class? Cece : yes Me : are you absolutely sure? Cece : yes don‚Äôt worry. \nThey arrive half an hour before class and we‚Äôre standing in the kitchen and Cece is making dinner for herself and her boyfriend and honestly, I‚Äôm not looking at her. We drink for half an hour and leave to class. The next day, I just get a feeling something‚Äôs off and I text her asking if she‚Äôs mad. She says yes. \n\nThe next day, she says she felt like it got a loud and crowded and they were standing in her way to the fridge and Winston had an exam and she had to cook for him so he could eat fast. I said sorry that was that. I told her I would be hosting no more pregames at our place and 100% meant it and honestly if she‚Äôd told me at any point that she didn‚Äôt like people coming over, I would‚Äôve responded in a manner respectful of her space. \n\nIn my mind, I felt rlly bad because she said she expected better from me as her best friend and I should‚Äôve noticed her facial expressions. She said I should‚Äôve asked my friends to move [she could‚Äôve asked them to move (she didn‚Äôt)]. But also, He is a guest and this is my home. His needs or wants don‚Äôt take ANY precedence over my guests. Her guests don‚Äôt take precedence over mine. Go fucking cook at his house (which is his alone). This happened a week ago but I find out from Jess that she went to hers after I left to rant about me and Jess told me she told Cece she thought I was an alcoholic. \n\nNow I‚Äôm starting to get a little upset a week later because I feel like they‚Äôve been talking behind my back. I feel like it stems from slight jealousy that they‚Äôre not my only friends anymore like they‚Äôve been for three years. I got so salty about the plants that for a moment I considered leaving the windows open but I didn‚Äôt have it in my heart to kill the poor plant. Instead, I‚Äôm going to be the best fucking plant owner ever. I‚Äôve been spending the last 2 days looking up plant care tips and I‚Äôve ordered fertiliser to use every 2 months so the plant flourishes under my care and he realises he‚Äôs a crappy plant owner.\n\nTLDR: this is going to be the best plant in the world.",

        "text": "One day during the time I was employed at a hardware store, I got a call via my department's phone. Answering it, the lady on the other end asked if we had Product X (I forgot what it was specifically). I told her that unfortunately, we were out of that specific item and she did not take that well. Even more so when I told her I didn't know when we'd be getting more as that was not one of my responsibilities. She then raised her voice a little and said the dreaded question.\n\n\"Do you know who I am!?!\" Oh crap, I was dealing with a Karen. What position would the wild Karen threaten us from this time? Lawyer? Doctor? Maybe City Council?\n\n\"I'm a librarian from (insert place here)!\" My mind honestly blanked out a little there. That was a new one. That was the first and to this day only time I have ever heard somebody use librarian as their supposedly \"I'm better than you\" job. Nothing against librarians of course. I just found it odd.\n\nOnce I snapped out of it, I again told her I couldn't do anything about out of stock items and she just got madder. It was then I heard the phone being passed to somebody else. I prayed that the new person had common sense. Unfortunately I got the complete opposite. The woman's husband began yelling at me in heavily accented English. The lady also had a heavy accent but her husband spoke at a high speed as well, making it near impossible to understand him. I did pick up stuff like \"You need to respect your elders\" and \"low wage worker\" though.\n\nIn the midst of this, I hatched a plan. This plan involved me taking my experiences from the scant time I had in Drama classes and using it to make myself sound as weak and pathetic as possible. Looking back on it in retrospect, I don't think I needed to do that for the plan to have worked but I did it anyway to make the man think he had a psychological advantage over me. He then demanded I give my name so he could tell my manager and get me in trouble.\n\n\"My name is John Smith sir.\" I said in a timid voice the first fake name that came to mind that also didn't match up at all with any of my coworkers. He believed it without any hesitation and jeered at me that I was going to get in trouble for whatever it is they thought I did wrong in their delusional heads before hanging up.\n\nI'd like to say my petty revenge ended with just them wasting their time trying to tell my superiors that John Smith existed but it didn't whilst still remaining within the petty zone. They didn't call the store. They straight up came to the store and yelled out \"Where's John Smith!?!\", making themselves look like lunatics in front of everyone, including my manager and coworkers who knew for sure John Smith didn't exist among the staff despite the couple's insistence. Nothing big happened after that besides angry arguments about John Smith's existence but the sight alone still gives me a chuckle when I remember it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Karen and her husband are mad we don't have specific item, I give them a fake name, instead of calling the manager they come to the store to complain about a nonexistent John Smith and look like loons in the process.",

My wife wants me to make a quick stop to pick up some takeout, then I'm home free. \n\nI get to the stoplight and make a right turn off the main road and into the merge lane . . . but I have to get all the way across two lanes to make a quick left turn. The light just turned so there's a steady stream of traffic across those two lanes - I'm stuck waiting for a break in the cars, but it's rush hour so I'm just going to have to wait for their light to turn red again. There's just not enough road between me and that left turn for me to merge with fast-moving traffic, cut across two lanes, then get into the left turn lane. I have to wait.\n\nSame for the guy behind me, he's got to wait. He's in a hurry, and I know this because he starts laying on his horn. Unfortunately, there's nowhere for me to go and no way for him to go around me. He gives me a couple short bumps of the horn at first, then he just decides to stand on it until the traffic clears and I can move.\n\nAs soon as I start forward and ease my way across the now open lanes, he whips around me and I think he's finally going to be on his way to whatever it is he can't be late for. This is when I enact my secret plan for vengeance. /s\n\nTurns out that he was in such a hurry to get past me and on his way that he zips around me, beats me into the left turn lane, and parks in front of me. He then waits for the left turn arrow to cycle from red to green, then back to yellow. At the last moment before it turns red again, he zips back out of the left turn lane and continues on his way, leaving me stuck for another stoplight cycle.\n\nYou read that right: Dude was so pissed about being mildly inconvenienced for 45 seconds that he got his petty revenge by willingly adding another 2 minutes to his own delay. I'm still trying to figure the logic of it.",

I start unloading onto the belt when I realize the guy behind me only has a few items, except just as I consider letting him go ahead he gives me a dirty look and puts his things on the belt before I‚Äôm anywhere near unloading my very full cart. Well, forget letting him go ahead. Then he starts pushing my cart further to the front, except there‚Äôs still a Covid barrier so there‚Äôs only so far it can go before I can‚Äôt unload. I push it back and continue unloading, pausing every few minutes to push his food back. Ooooooops might have squished those rolls a bit! Then he starts telling me I should move, full on gesturing and asking why I can‚Äôt move up completely disregarding the barrier. Finally it‚Äôs time to pay, well, I‚Äôve had these pandemic EBT cards I got for my kids sitting in my wallet for ages because they each only have $10 or so and I never feel like taking the time to do multiple transactions. How handy that now I have extra time! After all 6 transactions are done I thanked the cashier for her patience and told him he should apologize.",

        "text": "So I‚Äôm at the Dollar Store today. I don‚Äôt know where you all live, but around here the few stores are notoriously understaffed. It isn‚Äôt rare to have lines ten people deep with the cashiers struggling to move as fast as they can. I‚Äôm pretty patient as I work in a similar field and always give myself extra time when I go shop there.  \n\nSo the line is backed up halfway down the snack aisle. I‚Äôm number three in line to check out. A lady (sixth in line) with her five-year-old kid gets frustrated and starts getting aggressively loud, not quite yelling but loud enough most of the store can hear.  \n\nAggressive Lady (AL): ‚ÄúYou need to open a second register!! You move too slow! This store always does this! Open a second register!!\"  The poor cashier keeps her head down and tries moving faster, but it‚Äôs not helping. \n\nAL: ‚ÄúYou all need to say something! Speak up! They always do this! OPEN A SECOND REGISTER!!!‚Äù\n\nPeople in line are uncomfortable and shifting around, but no one says anything to her while she complains openly with her kid in tow. Under his breath the guy behind me says, ‚ÄúWhat do you want her to do, shut down this register and move to the other one?‚Äù Which draws some snickers from the crowd.  \n\nAL: ‚ÄúThis is bullshit!! You‚Äôre bullshit! Don‚Äôt talk to me with my kid! This Dollar Store SUCKS!!‚Äù (What?) She drags her kid up to the next-door, closed register line and slams her hand on the conveyor belt and goes, ‚ÄúOPEN THIS REGISTER!! OPEN THE SECOND REGISTER!!‚Äù\n\nDuring this the Manager has come out of the back and watched the commotion. He walks over to the register she‚Äôs at and flips on the light.  \n\nMGR: ‚ÄúI can help the next customer!‚Äù AL dumps all her stuff on the belt. MGR: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I said I can help the \\*next\\* customer. Sir?‚Äù And he gestures to me to come over as the person in front of me was now being helped by cashier one.  \n\nAL: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here! I‚Äôm first!‚Äù  \n\nMGR: ‚ÄúNo ma‚Äôam, he was before you. You cut the line. Sir? I can help you right here. Ma‚Äôam, can you please remove your things from the belt?‚Äù  \n\nAL: \\*Shocked Pikachu face\\*.  \n\nKid starts to cry. She (aggressively) smashes all her things back in her basket and goes back to her former sixth place in line, now fifth or whatever.  \n\nMGR: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam? I‚Äôve already told you no one is allowed to cut in line. I‚Äôll need you to go to the back. This Dollar Store may suck, but it‚Äôs my Dollar Store.‚Äù She slams her basket on the floor and drags her crying kid out of the store. \n\nHis petty revenge, not mine, but man it was fun to witness.",
