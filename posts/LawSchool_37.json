        "text": "Is it possible that this takes place? I know under the Equality Act 2010, if two people are equally qualified they can hire the person from the under represented group.\n\nPositive discrimination in the UK is not legal, and the unsuccessful candidate can potentially do something about it - but how would the unsuccessful candidate know, and surely it's subjective anyway? I just cant see firms getting caught out for positive discrimination.\n\nWe know they have their quotas. I've noticed when I've seen new trainee intake photos that the trainees are often perhaps 70% female and 70% ethnic minorities - is it possible that positive discrimination takes place, or is it just a case of very few white people and men apply, or very few are competent enough?\n\nIt it possible that someone who is not part of an 'under-represented group' and didnt go to a top 5 university at a disadvantage? I ask this because If I was determined to hire more people from underrepresented groups, I would hire a larger proportion of people from underrepresented groups, and then for the people who were not from such groups, I would hire the top Oxbridge candidates. The 3 or 4 white guys in the photos of 25/30 new trainees probably went to fee-paying schools where their parents paid hundreds of thousands for their education and thus they're at a significant advantage.\n\nSo where does that leave someone who isnt part of an underrepresented group, someone who is a solid candidate that would have stood a good chance if others were not hired based on which group they belong to? What about a guy who has had no advantages, no mentors or help, who is from a normal, working class family with a solid academic record?",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this concise but I'd appreciate some advice as I plan for life after law school. \n\nI'm a 3L who wants to ideally be a worker- and union-side employment attorney. My preference is to be more of a labor lawyer repping unions than doing civil litigation for individual employees, but both fields interest me. Also for context on salaries, etc., I live in the Los Angeles metropolitan area\n\nMy summer after 1L, I worked for Firm 1, which is primarily an employment firm with a small union-side practice. This past summer, I worked at Firm 2 as part of a fellowship. Firm 2 is a large union-side firm that almost exclusively represents and defends unions. Finally, Firm 3 is a smaller firm I live close to that also practices almost exclusively union law. \n\nI'm on the job hunt and antsy to get some security as to where I'll end up after the bar. Firm 2 liked my performance this past summer and invited me to be a spring clerk for them, but they've been playing footsie with whether they actually intend to hire me as an associate. The response has always been that they'll need to see where they're at closer to that time, and one associate told me he didn't receive an offer until the summer after he graduated. Additionally, Firm 2 is known for being a place where you go if you're so passionate about workers' rights that you're willing to work BigLaw hours without BigLaw pay. The people are great and passionate, though, and the firm is extremely well respected in the field. \n\nFirm 3 interviewed me a couple months ago and seemed to really like me. They made sure every partner talked to me, and even allowed me to chat with some of the associates privately. I get the sense that the pay grade isn't stellar, but the partners insist that the benefits are great and that everyone is very tight-knight. It's very conveniently located in case I need to go into the office, and it seems like I can work from home whenever I want. Plus, the vibe of Firm 3 is similar to Firm 1 in that everyone is very friendly and open. They told me they probably wouldn't get back to me until after the holidays, so I expect to hear back soon. \n\nYesterday, I received a call out of the blue from the managing partner for Firm 1. He offered me an associate position with a $100K base salary, + a discretionary bonus. The position would entail a mix of civil litigation and traditional labor. The drive to the office is long, but the position would also be as remote as I want it to be. Frankly, in this field, I never expected to be offered a starting salary in six figures and was taken aback (for comparison, the starting salaries of union attorneys I've been able to peep have been something between $60K and $85K). He told me it was a firm offer and that I had until spring break (more or less) to get back to him with a response. And while it's not the 100% union work I originally envisioned, I think I would be pretty happy with the position. \n\nSo, I guess I'm wondering a couple things:\n\n1) Do you think I should accept the offer now, or wait to see what other offers roll in before March? He assured me it's a firm offer, but I don't want to give the impression that his offer is the last resort when it's not. Plus the thought of knowing where I'm going to be at the end of the year (especially with a potentially pending recession) is very comforting to me. \n\n2) Should I tell Firm 2 about the offer? If so, should I do it now or wait a bit? If I'm worried that accepting the offer would cause them to not invest as much in my spring clerkship, what should I do? \n\n3) Would you choose a closer firm with work that's exactly what you want to do for *less* pay (probably around $80-85K), like Firm 3, or a firm with an office further away and work that's less directly related to what you wanted for more money (i.e. Firm 1)? (Keeping in mind that both firms would let me work from home almost whenever I wanted). \n\nI know a lot of this comes down to personal preference, but it would be really helpful to hear some other opinions on this from people who are going through the same thing and/or already went through it. And sorry for the long thread (this kind of feels like a final exam question, lol), I just couldn't think of a more concise way to lay it out. \n\nThanks so much, and happy new year!",

        "text": "I’m a 3L who signed up for a class due to the reputation of the Professor. I heard he was a really easy going, friendly guy and a favorable grader. He also heads up one of the clinics at my school. Much of our class time was spent off-topic, having him ramble passionately about the subject of the class (with a lot of tangents), or in group discussion amongst each other. Final grade was a paper and presentation video. I contributed the average amount in class discussion to where my participation shouldn’t impact my grade at all, and I submitted what I thought was a solid paper and video presentation.\n\nTo my surprise, my final grade came out to a B which is well below the permitted curve at my school considering the class size. This amounts to the worst grade I’ve received in law school and it really irritates me considering how unconventional the class was taught and the fact that little information concerning the final paper/presentation was provided until two weeks before the deadline. Our names were required to be on our papers and many of my classmates were members of his clinic while I am not. I’m looking to receive feedback on why my grade came out the way it did, but I doubt anything will change.\n\nI wanted to see if anyone else had a similar experience with something like this? I have a post-grad offer locked up and the firm essentially told me I can bomb this full next year and all that matters is I graduate, but I’d still like to keep my academic standing which this threatens. I do have a pass/fail available, but I was hoping to only use it if I really messed up this last semester. And my school does allow one to appeal a grade but I’m pretty sure it forfeits the opportunity to pass/fail that class and idk the success rate. Any advice or thoughts? I emailed him but I’m leaning towards just taking the L and pass/failing it.",

I’m hoping for 2024 admissions.\n\nI currently work in an affluent neighborhood at a bar where many of my customers and regulars are lawyers. They are also predominately men. Obviously, I try and pick their brains and glean from them what I can preparing for the LSAT and to go into law.  I’ve noticed that almost 80% of the time I talk to men who have gone to law school, and then continue into a career in law (not necessarily even passing the bar), they all are very discouraging about law school. They all approach it as them being “honest/real” and because I don’t know any Better all I can do is take it at face value. On the other hand, all the women lawyers I’ve met who all currently practice law are so encouraging and helpful and even when they are being “honest/real” it’s never off putting or makes me second guess myself. Reading various subreddits having to do with law school and practicing law etc there seems to be a majority of men responding and I have noticed a similar trend of men responding and either hating their jobs or regretting that they went to law school or pursued a degree in law. \nI guess I’d just really like to hear\nSpecifically from women who are in or\nWent to law school and/or are currently practicing law.\nLiterally anything you want to share or say from your experience and perspective or advice/insight you can pass on to other women seeking to get into law.

I dreamed of this exact degree and uni all throughout\nhigh school, having my motivations pretty clear: I love public speaking and debating (I adored MUNs) and I like the idea of helping people as a profession. I was very keen on law.\nThe main problem is I'm worried whether the law degree was a good choice, considering I question staying in my home country in the future, which would complicate things and prohibit me from working in the field since elsewhere I'd not have qualifications. Also, I don't think of a typical law firm position as a dream and I'm afraid that after graduating that's gonna be my sole option. \nI know plenty of languages, I love politics and traveling, and don't want to be tied down to my office/law firm job.\nWhat options are there for lawyers, who don't want the standard 9-5 and have similar interests, can anyone speak from experience?\n\np.s. I did think of studying international law after graduating with this degree (unfortunately, this is the only way to study it in PL, you can't just pick it up without previously graduating from law school.)",
