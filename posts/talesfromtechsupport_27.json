This only is important because now his superior needs to do this stuff.\n\nSo $ng  \"new guy\"  $mb  \"my boss\"  $me ... well me, yours truly mastapetz\n\nDay before Yesterday:  \n&gt;**$ng**: Hey masta, since this guy is gone, I need to do his stuff, I need access to that  \n&gt;**$me**: *me not knowing by heart what 'that' is* \"That\" being what?  \n&gt;**$ng**: *annoyed* Well everything  \n&gt;**$me**: Well, ok.  *I do not have time for that kind of shit, I just rename the old used to new user and change everything and send him everything needed*  \n\nYesterday:  \n&gt;**$ng**: *comes in agitated* It's not working.  \n&gt;**$me**: *mid call, with headset on tell my phone partner to hold on for a second* What is?  \n&gt;**$ng**: The account  \n&gt;**$me**:  ... I take a look, when I finish this call ...    \n&gt;**$ng**: *huffs and leaves*\n\nI check everything while on the phone, like I assumed, it works. In the back of my head I already know the problem. Our IT set up our citrix enviroment hair raisingly bad, my boss and me refuse to work with it where possible. We have two internet explorer \"installs\" one is the citrix version, the other the local version. Since THIS is 'general IT' it is not my responsibility, I  only am responsible for a special system.  \n  \n  \n&gt;**$me**: So I checked it, the username and password wor....  \n&gt;**$ng**: *motions frantically to his pc*  not. working.  \n&gt;**$me**: *noticing his laptop, and citrix client known what is going on, but try his cridentials anyway*  Yeah that is on our IT we have a 'local' and a 'citrix' browser I don't know which is which and neither which to use, ca...  \n&gt;**$ng**: So fix it!  \n&gt;**$me**: Call IT and tell them you need to know which browser to use for this tool they will help you, they know of the issue.  \n&gt;**$ng**: Why dont you fix it.  \n&gt;**$me**: *already leaving* Because THAT is not my responsibility.  \n\n2 hours later he comes in again.  \n&gt;**$ng**: I need log in details for our customer.  \n*Since I know we usually don't want that since the system aint THAT easy to understand and shows more than our contract makes us show them.*  \n&gt;**$me**: What should the customer see?  \n&gt;**$ng**: Everything.  \n&gt;**$me**: Everything, of what.  \n&gt;**$ng**: *proceeds to blabber a lot of stuff, I understand half of it and know that half of what he wants aint even possible, yet*  \n&gt;**$me**: Well send an email of what you need to me and my boss.  \n&gt;**$ng**: I just told you what I need!  \n&gt;**$me**: Email. Boss. Me. *take next incoming call and ignore him*   \n\n15 minutes later he comes in. and puts a piece of paper on my table, clearly a printed out email.  \n  \n&gt;**$ng**: Paper will do *I am not sure but I think he waved his had at me*  \n&gt;**$me**: What ... should I do with this?  \n&gt;**$ng**: Just send me what it says.  \n&gt;**$me**: Like I told you. Mail. Boss. Me.  \n&gt;**$ng**: *taking the paper from me* I will need that if I need to send you an Email.  \n\n5 minutes later an Email with 4 lines a total of 18 words, I have absolutely no idea what he wants. Best part \"I need this until Thuesday 12 PM\" at Thursday 3pm, my usual office times are weekdays 9AM to 1PM.\n\nI wrote him an email, a long one, exclaiming pricely what I need.  \n\ntoday:\n&gt;**$mb**: Your email to $ng was good, I will send something additional, because I too have no idea what he needs, I know what he wants but he needs to communicate it clearly.  \n&gt;**$me**: And his \"until\" ?  \n&gt;**$mb**: Well if he doesnt give you what you need you can't answer his questions, and if he doesnt react to your OR to my email its his head not ours.\n\nBit longer than I intended it to be. But I think this guy wants to be a Jedi, to bad mind tricks dont work on me. OH and I still can not read minds, and I am quite happy.",

So everybody, who submitted a ticket got the following response.\n\n\n&gt; Dear Sir or Madam,\n&gt;\n&gt; The helpdesk will be out of office until $Date.

        "text": "That is a vague title to not let off any spoilers.\n\nI did a service for a business a couple of months back. The customer had an old iMac (5-6 years old) with really good specifications (256SSD, 2tb HDD mainly empty, 16gb RAM and a quad core CPU) . He had some minor problems with his mac which were all fixed in a couple of minutes. I noticed he was running a Windows 7 virtual machine through Parallels Desktop.\n\nYesterday I got another service request. He was complaining his computer has been running really slow and is out of storage space so I will have to replace the HDD with a bigger one. This was surprising because he had 2TB left the last time I was there.\n\nI get there and check his system. He still has 2TB free space unused but the SSD is full. I assume he wants the SSD replaced. I think if I can convince him to move his files from the SSD to the HDD then maybe I will save myself the trouble of doing the replacement. He agrees that if I can move some stuff and give him some storage he is happy without the replacement.\n\nStart looking for stuff I can move. There is nothing that can be moved apart from the Win7 virtual machine file sitting at 185gb. I moved the file to the HDD and configured Parallels Desktop to point to the new VM file.\n\nAsk him to test it out. He launches the Win7 VM which loads slowly. Opens My Computer and the C: on the VM still shows as full. He points to it and tells me I haven't really fixed the problem. Explain it is only a resource allocation issue. Switch VM off and allocate 512gb to the VM, 8gb RAM, 4 Cores and restart.\n\nAsk him to test it out again and he is happy with the results. He asks how I managed to increase the C: without having to change the drive. Explain it is a resource allocation setting. I am given some tea at his office which is still hot. I sit back sipping my tea and had some chit chat with him.\n\n&gt;Me: How much did you pay for the iMac.\n\n&gt;Him: Around 5k altogether including the upgrades\n\n&gt;Me: That is a lot of money.\n\n&gt;Him: Yep, cant skip on a computer. All my work depends on it. I used to have a private IT tech I would contact for all my IT needs. When I needed a new computer I asked him to get me the best money can buy and this is what he got me.\n\nSee him doing everything on the VM, checking outlook, word documents, browsing.\n\n&gt;Me: Why do you do everything on the Win7 VM?\n\n&gt;Him: I don't like the apple thing, too confusing. I like Windows 7\n\n&gt;Me: Why didn't you go for a PC then if you wanted to run Windows on it?\n\n&gt;Him: We tried that but it didn't work. So the tech suggested I use Parallels Desktop and I pretty happy with it.\n\nThat explains why his SSD had remnants of Windows files on the C: someone had attempted a dual boot setup but wasn't able to make it work.\n\n&gt;Me: No, what I am asking is why did you go for a Mac instead of going for a Windows environment.\n\n&gt;Him: I would have loved to but unfortunately it didn't work.\n\nThen it dawns on me. He does not know the difference between a Mac and a PC. His tech told him this is the only way he can use Windows and he has been happy running a Win 7 on a VM with 2gb ram allocation, 2 core allocation and a small amount of storage allocated to it for 5+ years. After paying $5000.",

        "text": "**Edit: formatting**\n\nI used to work for a small telco that branched out into TV.  I handled (mainly) the TV headend stuff (satellites, transcoding, middleware, provisioning software, hardware to support the previous, etc).  Although this telco had been an ISP for years, DSL didn't really have a huge penetration (very rural area).  The addition of (IP)TV was a sudden change in the tech level of the outfit.  Suddenly, all the outside techs would have to touch something that talked on a network... not just that one guy who \"knew\" DSL.  It was an interesting transition as some of these techs had been telco guys for decades (at least one guy for almost 50 years!) and were quite set in their ways (tip and ring, anything else was a \"management problem\", even PBXs were too much for them).  The initial rollout was mainly handled by contractors, but eventually the old hands would have to take over.  Here are a couple of quick stories about that \"adventure\".  These can be taken as \"Tales from a Level 3\" :-)\n\n**1. \"What do you mean we have to test the wiring?\"**\nSo, these guys and gals would have to run cat5e from the router to the individual tv set top boxes (stbs).  We started getting a lot of complaints about TV breaking up at newer customers locations.  There was a lot of troubleshooting and swearing, but in the end it turned out that all the techs (more than a dozen across maybe 20 towns) shared TWO cable testers.  They would just wire and \"if the green light comes on, the hardware says it's fine\".  It took a VERY long time to convince the company that each tech needed their own cable tester (certifier, really) and that every cable they ran needed to certify at 1Gbps or else it was a redo.\n\n**2. Troubleshooting is for weenies.**\nAnother one of the common issues (sometimes relating to #1) was trying to figure out why one TV would work and another one would not.  Sometimes a STB would be bad, or someone in the office messed up the provisioning, other times the customer's TV was borked.  In order to make it easier to troubleshoot I created a pile of \"test kits\" which included a tiny TV, known good STB provisioned to a Test account with full access, and known good cables in a laptop bag.  Every tech got one of their very own to keep in their van (and one was permanently hooked up at every CO).  The intent was... having a problem at a location?  Use one (or all!) of these components to verify what's working and what isn't.  No sound?  swap to your tiny TV... magically works now?  it must be the customer's TV.  Really straightforward stuff, right?  Nope.  Calls all the time like \n&gt; Tech: \"I can't figure out what's wrong with your f&amp;#^ing TV\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Ok, what have you tried\"\n\n&gt; Tech: \"I replaced the wire like 5 times\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Have you tried your test set?  right at the router?\"\n\n&gt; Tech: \"I don't take it with me, it's at the CO\"  \n\n&gt; Me: *facepalm*\n\n**3. Logic is for losers**\nMy least favorite one was the inevitable \n&gt; Tech: \"when are you going to fix 'that' problem\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"which problem is 'that'?\"\n\n&gt; Tech: \"Wow, what do you do all day?  $wholetown hasn't had $channel since yesterday\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Um\" (checks inbox, voicemail, etc to find no mention of this) \"hold on\" (check channel in office and it works fine) \"it seems to be fine here, how's it looking at the $CO?\"\n\n&gt; Tech: \"I don't have time to do your job!\"\n\n&gt; Me:  \"wait, aren't you calling from $CO?  Can't you just change the channel to that one right now\"\n\n&gt; Tech: \"We're watching $SPORT right now, look I shouldn't have to tell you but if it's down at $wholetown it's got to be a problem at the headend and you should fix it\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Um, I can watch the channel fine here so it's not the headend, I'm betting it's at the CO but if you can just check we can send it to $theonlynetworkingguy to look at it\"\n\n&gt; Tech: \"can't you do anything at all?\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"yes, hold on\" (remotely reboots the STB they are using to watch $SPORT)\n\n**4. Why are you trying to get us to do your job?**\nI finally got annoyed that the techs did not even understand really basic networking concepts.  Like what an IP was and how to ping something with their laptops and how to tell if the problem was \"upstream\" from the customer's location or not (\"what is their gateway and can you ping it\").  I (foolishly?) thought that they were simply untrained and took it upon myself (with upper management approval) to arrange some really basic \"Networking 101\" classes (their supervisor was a telco guy who didn't know any networking either).  It was a four half day course.  Some of it was CBT (playing in a conference room) and some of it was me or $theonlynetworkingguy talking about our specific layout.  Nothing too complicated... what is an IP, netmask, gateway, network, router vs switch, etc).  Towards the end, I got this comment: \"I mean, thanks for the half week off and donuts and all but why are you trying to get us to do your job?\"  \n\n**5. Unfamiliar places**\nSometimes a jumper would need to be run in one of the COs or colos to support some new customer or something.  Myself, $theonlynetworkingguy, $thepcguy, and $CTO would switch off having to drive to whatever location (far away or not) and do whatever at all odd hours (my least favorite was the place \"inside\" Macy's in Boston... you guys know the one, right?... Simply because I hate driving in Boston).  It would be a chore because we'd need to get all the junk together (jumpers, OTDR... just in case, light meter, tools, label maker, etc, etc) and hope we could get a vehicle (damn sales has all the cars again).  Only $theonlynetworkingguy knew what was really going on for these, the rest of us were just dumb hands.  Once, I tried to get one of our techs to do one of these runs (the $CTO and $theonlynetworkingguy had long since given up).  They have all of these tools and a van to carry them every day!  The one I picked was one of the younger ones.  The answer I got was \"Oh, I don't like going to unfamiliar places\" (you mean you're familiar with every single customer in your town? wow!)\n\n\n",

        "text": "When I was the IT Director at $MidwestCollege, $PhotoInstructor was constantly railing on the fact that she couldn't get a Mac. \n\nThe entire faculty was PC, but the $PhotoInstructor's lab was all Macs. It would have made sense to give her a Mac for software commonality, however $ITVP, who I had worked for previously, adamantly opposed Macs for anybody on the faculty, knowing that once the camel's nose was under the tent there were a dozen other faculty members who would lose their minds and demand one.\n\nThe political aspects of a Mac for this user aside, there really some technical issues, too. File shares, getting email easily, VPN client, the Student Information System, etc. The answer remained \"No,\" and both the $ArtDeptHead and the $FacultyDean backed that up, which made life easier.\n\nCut to about 10 days after the last \"I really, really, really *need* a Mac..\" whine from $PhotoInstructor. She goes to $BigCity several hours away from $MidwestCollege to photograph the Thanksgiving Day parade. Comes back to her car afterward to find the rear passenger window smashed and her laptop missing. The following Monday, she's in her dean's office waving a police report and a renewed demand for a Mac.\n\nWhen $Dean called me about the theft, I was excited.  Thinking I could help the cops out, I logged in to the \"LoJack\"-type laptop locator system we had.  (Its been too long so I don't remember the specific program, might have been Lojack For Laptops or the IBM/Lenovo-specific program, but I don't recall anymore)  Any staff or faculty laptop had this program, and I could login to a web portal and see where a laptop was last \"checked in\" from. \n\nI felt like that admiral in The Empire Strikes Back: \"Good, our first catch of the day!\"\n\nSure enough, the missing laptop had been turned on and checked in to the system in the days since the theft! \n\nOh, look, its **ON RIGHT NOW!**\n\nI couldn't imagine our good luck. \"We're going to get this laptop back,\" I'm thinking. \n\nI click the icon and hit \"locate\" and up pops a map of the town where the college is located, with the pin located in a residential neighborhood a mile or so away.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"huh? What the hell?\"\n\nThen it dawns on me. I called my boss, the $SeniorVP of the college. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"$SeniorVP, I think we have a problem.\"\n\nHe comes down to my office and I walk him thru it. I can see his brow furrow as I explain what it means, and by the time I'm done the only thing *not* happening is steam shooting out his ears. I print out screen shots of all of this for him and continue to monitor it for him.\n\nFrom what I understand, $SeniorVP sat down with the $FacultyDean, the $PhotoInstructor and the $CampusSafetyDirector, a retired cop. He had $CampusSafetyDirector explain what the penalties were, especially in $BigCity, for filing a false police report. He then suspended $PhotoInstructor pending a faculty ethics panel review and gave her the choice of bringing the laptop back on her own, or they'd arrange for the local cops to recover the college's \"stolen property\" from her house.\n\nPredictably the ethics panel was wishy-washy on action. The $SeniorVP was not. He fired the $PhotoInstructor.\n\nSomewhat magically,the faculty stopped bitching about getting Macs after that. Weird.",

        "text": "Hello TFTS. LTL. FTP. \n\nI hope this story is TFTS-appropriate. TL;DR at the bottom. As part of my overall duties I support some very specialized software for my company. There are few people in my country who actually use the software let alone support it, so much so that identifying it would give me away in an instant if someone I worked with happened to see this. Today started out pretty normal. I picked up a drink from my favorite store on the way in, parked in my second favorite parking spot and plopped myself in my office and set myself to working on my ticket queue. Things were falling into place and I was all set to have just **one** ticket left in my queue before lunch and that ticket was waiting on a deliverable from someone else in another division so the rest of my day was going to be left for my pet projects.\n\n\nThat is to say it was going to be left for my pet projects until there was a whimsical knock on my open door and another division's team leader poked his head around my door frame. The cast of characters for what unfolded is as follows:\n\n**$ME**: The guy who just wants to be left alone in his cozy office.\n\n**$ETL**: Eager Team Lead. An all-around nice guy.\n\n**$AU**: Anonymous User. Fancies being a whistleblower.\n\n**$EP**: Executive Person. Likes to have his way.\n\n\n\n*$ETL gingerly steps into my office while swinging his hands with nervous energy.*\n\n&gt;**$ETL:** Hey TK. How are you?\n\n&gt;**$ME:** I'm good. What's up?\n\n&gt;**$ETL:** Oh nothing much. Hey, thanks for all the help with &lt;project&gt; changes to &lt;software&gt;. I talked to $EP and he wants to go ahead and pull the trigger on the other change we discussed.\n\n&gt;**$ME:** *thinking: Other change.. oh! The interface change.* Okay! I'll send you a message once I have it done.\n \n\n\n$ETL thanked me and walked his polite self out of my office. I turned around and settled into making a user-facing change to the software that I had warned against making, but at this stage debating it any further would basically be like talking to the wall. I made my recommendation, they elected to go another route, it didn't affect the stability of any of my systems so I put on my best friendly personality and took care of my customer.\n\n\nA little bit later in walks one of $ETL and $EP's users, $AU. $AU looks like they have something on their mind, and they do because the pleasantries are skipped. This is fine with me. I only pretend to have good soft skills anyway. \n\n&gt;**$AU:** Uh.. hey TK. Why did you &lt;insert change here&gt;?\n\n&gt;**$ME:** $ETL asked me to make the change and said he had $EP's approval. I tried to talk them out of it, but they made the decision to do it. I'm sorry.\n\n&gt;**$AU:** But it makes it difficult to &lt;insert job function here&gt;.\n\n&gt;**$ME:** Yeah. I know. \n\n*At this point I thought $AU was going to wind up to unleash on me, as you know everything is the fault of the IT department. But they surprised me. Later, they would really surprise me.*\n\n&gt;**$AU:** Oh. Okay. Well hey, listen, don't say anything about me coming to you okay?\n\n&gt;**$ME:** Uh. Sure! No problem.\n\n$AU departed my office and once again I was left in peace to do my thing. Well... for an hour, maybe an hour and a half. I was mentally knee deep in an email my boss asked me to write when I felt a shift in my office's tone. I became acutely aware of someone behind me. Turning slightly, and minimizing my email, I found that $EP had entered my office and was sliding out from behind my chair. This is why I hate having my back to the door. With $EP is $ETL who looks considerably less eager. \n\n&gt;**$EP:** Can you show me what change you made with $ETL?\n\n&gt;**$ME:** Sure.\n\n*I pull up the administration window for the server application and proceed to explain. There are two screens that are similar and had some slight overlap, I was asked to remove the overlap from one. I explained what each screen now displayed to their end users.*\n\n&gt;**$EP:** Okay. Did someone call and talk to you about this change?\n\n&gt;**$ME:** Well, a conversation was had.\n\n&gt;**$EP:** Can you tell me who it was?\n\n&gt;**$ME:** Um... I said I wouldn't. *gives an uncomfortable, blank stare.*\n\n&gt;**$EP:** I don't understand.\n\n*I swivel my chair around and look between the two of them.*\n\n&gt;**$ME:** What's going on? *looking directly at $ETL.*\n\n&gt;**$ETL:** Someone made an anonymous complaint to compliance about the change.\n\n&gt;**$ME:** Oh. Well, if someone made an anonymous complaint there's no way I'm telling you who I talked to. I can't do that.\n\n&gt;**$EP:** What?? *looking visibly irritated.*\n\n&gt;**$ME:** ...If it was anonymous they don't want anyone to know who it was. I'm not crossing legal and telling you who I spoke to.\n\n*$EP, looking visibly upset, stalks out of my office in quick, angry steps. I suspect that had $ETL not been standing in front of my door he would have slammed the door shut. $ETL gives me an apologetic shrug and leaves.*\n\n\nTL;DR: Warned against a change in a department's software. Department heads decided to do it anyway. Employee contacts compliance because they believe it adversely affects their work.  Department executive gets mad at me for not telling him who I talked to. Department executive is literally the reason why anonymous reporting exists.\n\n\nEDIT: Fixed formatting, I hope.",

        "text": "First post ever on Reddit, so please let me know if I have formatting errors. Lurker of this sub since I created an account. I never thought I’d actually have a story applicable for this sub, but never say never. I hope you enjoy it. Bonus points if you read the title in Orisa’s voice. \n\n**Back Story:**\n\nI work the midnight shift in a level one trauma center. You know the one…they almost won a recent popular championship. We are open 24/7 and have four in-house OR nursing staff scheduled every midnight shift until 7am. \n\n\nWe have no managers or supervisors that work midnights or weekends so the staff take turns being in the charge nurse role for the night/weekend. We have a manager on call in case something crazy occurs and we don’t know how to handle it.\n\nAlso important for this story is that there are parameters an OR must meet to be safe for surgery. Temperature, humidity, and air pressure (positive pressure) are all monitored continuously at the OR front desk and if one of the three fall out of acceptable range, a visual alarm goes off. The monitor is mounted at eye level at the front desk so all staff can see it quickly and easily. \n\n**Cast:**\n\n&gt;**$Me:** A current surgical nurse who taught herself how to write code and program back in the early 2000’s so she could make money from home as a single mom to three very young kids.    \n\n&gt;**$Clerk:** Operating room (OR) front desk clerk    \n\n&gt;**$Maintenance:** They keep our OR’s functioning   \n \n&gt;**$AnesRes:** Anesthesia Resident    \n\n&gt;**$AnesFac:** Anesthesia Faculty\n\n**The Main Event:**\n\nThis happened on a Friday into Saturday midnight shift. The evening manager was leaving at 10pm on Friday and gave me the charge radio and phone. In her handoff she informed me that **$maintenance** were doing work in two of our OR’s so I would be unable to use those rooms for cases. 30 minutes later the $maintenance guy came to the front desk and said they were done with their work. He would call systems to have them turn the air handling system back on, because they had turned it off to do their work. He left and that was that….so I thought.\n\nOur evening staff all leave at 11pm and after that if there are rooms still running we utilize in-house and on call staff. This night we had 4 rooms still going so I had to call staff in. I managed to get some staff already working to volunteer to stay so I only had to mess up 2 people’s Friday night. \n\nI went to a room that was finished with the operation but was waiting for the patient to wake up from anesthesia so they could go to PACU (post anesthesia care unit).  At about 10:45pm, while in the room I received a phone call:\n\n&gt;**$Clerk:** All of the rooms on the monitor just turned red and are alarming. What should I do? \n   \n&gt;**$Me:** Wait, did you say all the rooms are alarming?  \n  \n&gt;**$Clerk:** Yes    \n\n&gt;**$Me:** Call systems immediately and put in a high priority ticket. I am in a room right now so I will get to the front desk as soon as I can.   \n \n&gt;**$Clerk:** Ok\n\n\n[This is what the monitor looked like](https://imgur.com/qZONVR3)\n\nWell right when my patient rolled out of the room, two of the other rooms finished up as well so I went to help them clean up and send call staff home to sleep. It was now midnight and the charge nurse phone rang.\n\n&gt;**$Me:** Main OR this is **$yavanna12**    \n\n&gt;**$Clerk:** I have maintenance on the line for you    \n\n&gt;**$Me:** Ok…*pause while clerk connects call*  Hi this is **$yavanna12**   \n \n&gt;**$Maintenance:** Hi, we can not determine why the OR’s are alarming, we think maybe it’s something to do with the fire damper system.   \n \n&gt;**$Me:** The rooms are still alarming? That’s not good. Can you meet me at the OR front desk?”    \n\n&gt;**$Maintenance:** Already here.\n\nI head to the front desk and see two **$maintenance** workers there, but neither were the guy that an hour and a half before told me he was contacting systems to turn the air back on to the rooms that were shut down.\n\n&gt;**$Me:** Hi, I’m **$yavanna12**. Were either of you working on the shut down rooms today?    \n\n&gt;**$Maintenance:** No, we are the midnight staff and just came in at 11pm. Day shift told us everything was done and operational with no issues. We monitored the rooms and we can’t find why they are alarming. We think it is related to air flow, but the rooms are still getting air pressure so they should be ok.     \n\n&gt;**$Me:** Positive pressure or Negative pressure?    \n&gt;**$Maintenance:** Positive.    \n\n&gt;**$Me:** Ok, so how about room temperature and humidity? Are those functioning properly for all the rooms?    \n\n&gt;**$Maintenance:** Uh, I’m not sure.  Is that important?   \n \n&gt;**$Me:** Yes, for an OR to be safe we have to maintain certain parameters related to temperature, pressure, and humidity. Since all the rooms are showing red, one of the three or more is not working.    \n\n&gt;**$Maintenance:** We will have to go back downstairs to check our readings. \n   \n&gt;**$Me:** Ok, please do so and let me know what you find.\n\nNow to be fair to maintenance, the weekend, midnight shift are usually the newer hires, and they are not always aware of the OR’s specific needs. Especially with such a big hospital, it’s a lot to learn and I don’t expect them to know everything.  \n\nPhone rings and it’s maintenance.\n\n&gt;**$Maintenance:** Thermostats should be working ok, if you need to change the temperature you can just go to a room and change the setting on the thermostat.    \n\n&gt;**$Me:** I understand that, but are the temperature readings for each room accurate? How about the humidity readings?   \n \n&gt;**$Maintenance:** Not sure. Let me call my supervisor and get his help to figure this out. \n\nAfter that I started making a plan. I knew to be safe I couldn’t place any cases in those rooms. This was an issue as we were the level one trauma center and an emergency can happen at any time. Time to call the manager on call. \n\nUnfortunately, she doesn’t respond to pages or answer her phone. Turns out later when following up, when I asked the clerk for the manager on call phone number she looked at the wrong sheet and gave me the wrong managers info. So…it’s on me. I call **$anesthesia** to meet me at the front desk. \n\n&gt;**$Me:** All our rooms are alarming. As of right now maintenance cannot figure out why all the rooms are in the red. We can’t place cases in these rooms until they functional.    \n\n&gt;**$Anesthesia:** I see. I am going to call the Cardiovascular operating rooms and see if they can hold some rooms for us to operate at their facility in case something emergent books.\n\nWhile he was on the phone I take a closer look at the monitor. You can see it too in the picture I provided. Now here is where I felt a fool. I had assumed since our clerk and two maintenance staff had looked at the monitor before calling me, they had also checked the lower right hand corner of the screen that shows what the readings of each OR is. This is to help pin point the problem. But you know what they say about assuming.\n\nAccording to the monitor, the parameters for the highlighted room were acceptable, but the room still showed red. The monitor is touchscreen and so I decided to tap another room to check its readings. As soon as I tapped the screen I heard a beep from the CPU and nothing happened on screen. Sigh…I had strong suspicions about the problem at this point and followed my instincts. \n\n&gt;**$Me:** is the CPU for this monitor under your desk?  \n  \n&gt;**$Clerk:** Not sure, why?   \n \n&gt;**$Me:** I want to restart it since the screen is unresponsive.\n\nShe begins to follow the cords looking for a box when I notice a refresh symbol in the upper left hand corner of the monitor. I tap it and viola…all the rooms turn white. I tap the screen and can now see the readings of each room I tap. \n\nI tell anesthesia we are back in business and explain my theory. I suspect when hospital systems turned the air handling system back on, it messed with the pressures of all the rooms for a brief moment before equalizing out. All the rooms would have started to alarm at once when the pressure changed and the poor CPU couldn’t handle 34 alarms at once. So it froze giving the appearance that our rooms were alarming for hours. \n\nI told **$maintenance** what I did and they laughed about it, thinking it crazy that all this trouble was fixed by turning it off and on again. \n\n$TLDR: Take the tweezers off the metal edge in Operation^TM and the buzzing red nose will stop. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "*The setup: This is in response to a comment from a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8b7u6h/so_you_know_how_to_use_this_right/) I made the other day.*\n\nEvery school year in August about 2 -3 weeks out from the first day, staff start trailing back in, part of the yearly process is they are issued a laptop for use throughout the year. Now we know the staff who take care of their stuff and those are issued the newer laptops. However there are always the ones who break, lose or manage to mess up the issued laptop, they get the \"whatever is left over\" pile. \n\nAbout a week or so after getting their issued laptop I get a ticket that goes, oh something like this.\n\n**$IST** = Me\n**$TLU** = Trashed Laptop User\n\nTicket comes in basically stating that laptop has stopped working, at this point I head on down to check in on the **$TLU**. \n\n&gt; **$TLU** This morning my laptop stopped working\n\n&gt; **$IST** What happened to it?\n\n&gt; **$TLU** It doesn't power on and the keys are sticky. \n\nAt this point I'm already smelling the mixture of coffee and cleaning products\n\n&gt; **$IST** Did anything spill on it?\n\n&gt; **$TLU** Yeah just a little bit spilled when I picked up my cup earlier, but it hasn't been working since yesterday. \n\nAt this point I walk over pick up the laptop and feel it sloshing around. When I tip the laptop to it's side a waterfall of coffee comes pouring out of the exhaust fan. To which I exclaim.\n\n&gt; **$IST** Just a little bit huh. \n\n**TL;dr:** User dumped what seemed like a whole pot of coffee onto the computer and fried the internal components. \n",

        "text": "I debated for a long time about whether to post this, because I had a relatively small role in fixing it, but I feel that it serves as a cautionary tale about what happens when non-tech people do tech stuff.\n\n \n\nThe characters:\n\n$Me - The only programmer at my company.  \n\n$Boss - My boss. Mostly clueless about technology.\n\n$Supe - My supervisor. Not a tech person, but he's far more tech-savvy than $Boss\n\n$Tech - An outside programmer that the company calls when my workload gets too large for one person.  Smart guy, easy to work with.\n\n$OtherTech - A computer repair guy who takes care of the company's machines, because hardware is not my thing.\n\n$NewGuy - A PPC ad guy, newly hired.\n\n \n\nThis tale starts while I am 33 weeks pregnant, and preparing to go on 3 months of maternity leave.  $Boss informs me that $Tech will be taking over my duties while I'm gone.  All fine, I compile a list of what needs to be maintained in my absence and send it to $Tech.  Then $Boss informs me that a new hire, $NewGuy, will be using my computer while I'm gone, because he's in a trial period and they don't want to spend money on a machine for him until they're sure he's staying.  I am not happy about this, naturally, but I have no choice.\n\n \n\nSo, I set up a second account on my machine, and do some registry editing so that this account will not be able to do anything that could cause catastrophic damage in the hands of the clueless.  All good, right?  Wrong.  The next day, $Supe comes up to me and tells me that $Boss wants me to give him the password to my user account, \"just in case\".  He reassures me that it would only be used in emergencies.  I am not reassured, but again, I have no choice.\n\n \n\nI have my baby, and take my three months of maternity leave.  The day I come back, I am the first person to arrive in the office.  I boot up my computer.  The first thing I see is that there is only one user account on the screen.  The second thing I see is that the name on the account is not my own, but $NewGuy's.  As no one else is in the office, I call up $Tech to see if he knows anything about this.\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: Hi $Tech, do you know anything about what happened to my machine?\n\n&gt;$Tech: Nope. Your boss barely had me doing anything, so I never even came into the office.\n\n&gt;$Me: *groans internally* Thanks, have a good one.\n\n \n\nI wait two hours until the first of my coworkers arrives.  He knows that something happened to my computer, but can't describe it other than \"it crashed\".  This does not bode well.\n\n \n\nFinally $Supe comes in.\n\n\n\n&gt;$Me: $Supe, what happened to my computer?\n\n&gt;$Supe: It was running out of space, and we had to repartition it.\n\n&gt;$Me: What?\n\n&gt;$Supe: We had to get rid of the Linux partition on your computer.\n\n&gt;$Me: My computer didn't have a Linux partition.\n\n&gt;$Supe: Oh. Um...\n\n\n\n$NewGuy had arrived while I was talking to $Supe, so I try him next.\n\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Hey $NewGuy, what happened to my computer?\n\n&gt;$NewGuy: Oh, I was cleaning up the disk and then it crashed.\n\n&gt;$Me: What do you mean you were cleaning it up?\n\n&gt;$NewGuy: I had to delete some files, the disk was running out of space and I couldn't work.\n\n&gt;$Me: *facepalms internally* I see.  Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nMy work computer has a 1TB secondary drive for file storage, in addition to the system drive, so if the system drive fills up, you're supposed to move old files to the secondary drive.  Apparently $NewGuy didn't know this.  I go back to $Supe.\n\n\n\n&gt;$Me: $NewGuy said he was deleting files when the computer crashed?\n\n&gt;$Supe: Yeah, after that happened we just had $OtherTech reinstall Windows, since we thought Linux was taking up space on the drive.\n\n&gt;$Me: Do you have his number?\n\n\n\nI call $OtherTech.\n\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Hi $OtherTech, I heard you reinstalled Windows on my machine?  Could you give me any more details about what you saw?\n\n&gt;$OtherTech: Not really, I just formatted the drive and installed Windows on it.\n\n&gt;$Me: What about the other drive?  And did you do a backup?\n\n&gt;$OtherTech: I only detected one drive when I was working, and no, I didn't do a backup.  Your boss told me not to bother.\n\n&gt;$Me: *fuming* Okayyyyy, I'll get back to you.\n\n\n\nI badger $NewGuy to give me the password, and log in to my machine.  I check My Computer.  I see 3 drives there, not including the CD drive. One is tiny, one is almost the same size as the old system drive, and one is a bit under a terabyte.  The one that was a bit under a terabyte was labeled C:\\.  It appeared that $OtherTech had installed Windows on the 1TB drive, which meant that all the data on it was lost forever.  I call $OtherTech back.\n\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Hi again, it looks like you detected my machine's data drive, and installed Windows on it.  But there's a much faster SSD that Windows is supposed to be installed on, and it looks like it's split into two partitions, but one of them is tiny.  Do you know why this is?\n\n&gt;$OtherTech: I think I know what happened.  I'll be over in half an hour.\n\n\n\nTrue to his word, $OtherTech arrives in half an hour and pokes around the two drives. Then he explains to me that when he initially arrived and started working, he hadn't detected the SSD because whatever $NewGuy deleted had really screwed things up.  The reason the SSD looked like it was in two partitions is because it was, the tiny partition was the system reserve space from the Windows installation.  He pulled all the salvageable files off of the SSD, took Windows off the 1TB drive, and then reinstalled windows on the SSD.\n\n\n\nI go back to $Supe once this is over.\n\n\n\n&gt;$Me: $NewGuy should never have been able to delete anything that would make the computer crash from his account.  Did you give him my account's password?\n\n&gt;$Supe: Well, yes, but we had to.  He kept getting these \"disk almost full\" messages and couldn't work.\n\n&gt;$Me: You could have called $Tech.\n\n&gt;$Supe: Look, I'm sorry... We had to make a decision quickly...\n\n&gt;$Me: *gives up*\n\n\n\nI spent the next few days restoring xampp and my local sites, as they were huge and therefore stored on my data drive, while fielding complaints that I wasn't getting my work done.  $NewGuy remained at the company, and was never reprimanded or penalized for what he did.

        "text": "I was working in a big national media, in the data journalism center where all the tech guys are. I was the newbie and keeping a low profile, which is how I witnessed one very interesting exchange between my coworker (**Peter**) and a journalist working on a big yearly analysis of all the schools in the country (**Lana**). \n\nOne day, Lana showed up in our office and asked for \"the tech guy\". Peter made himself known, thinking he would just fix whatever computer issue she was having and that'd be it. Turns out the company makes a national ranking of all the schools in the country and the tech guy who used to do it every year just quit. Peter is forced into that new role. He tried to get concrete instructions to follow, how to do the damn thing, but Lana just told him \"You're a tech guy, that's your job, not mine\" and gave him the data.\n\nPeter worked himself to the bone on that thing. All day everyday, barely a break to have lunch, for over a week. Turns out Lana had all the info on the **62,000** schools, which needed to be treated and ranked, **on a Word document** because she found Excel too complicated. And every day, she'd come to our office and angrily bitch at Peter for not being done yet, openly calling him useless and stupid. Peter took it like a champ. \n\nAfter a dozen days, he called Lana over and showed off his finished work and explained it to her, as he had to basically invent from scratch the entire methodology for it. She looked at it for a minute then said \"Yeah, nah, that's not the method we usually use.\" When asked why she didn't say so on the dozens of times she was asked before, she snickered and said \"Just slipped my mind, whatever. But your method won't cut it. Start over.\"\n\nI think something broke in Peter's mind. He was dead silent for a few seconds, then wordlessly stood up, walked to our manager's desk, and told him \"I will not tolerate this anymore. I either never work with that woman ever again, or I quit here and now.\" He said all that with Lana right there, hearing everything. She screeched it was the end of his career, that she'll have his head, that he's a moron who can't even handle such a simple task. \n\nOur boss walked in, attracted by the obvious commotion. After hearing both sides of the story (and Lana's very smug retelling of how Peter was a moron who worked at a snail's pace), he looked Lana in the eye. \"The company would be in deep trouble with*out* Peter,\" he said. \"He has very valuable skills that nobody else here has. You are expendable, he is not.\" I was like a little mouse, keeping very quiet but enjoying the drama. Lana's face fell and she started apologizing to the boss, to Peter, to the manager. And for days after that, Lana was extremely polite and reverent when talking to Peter about how to operate the software and apply his method to the data. The work had to be redone from scratch, but Lana and her team were the ones doing it, while Peter was teaching them the technical aspect of it so he'd never have to do it again. That was pretty awesome.\n\nEDIT: with -&gt; without",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8bl7uc/red_and_the_power_seat/",
        "text": "When I started working at $MidwestCollege, my entire support team were wary of $Red. Their interactions and dealings with him were always troublesome and frequently wound up with \"You guys handle it\" or \"Not my problem,\" or the ever famous \"Looks good from here.\"\n\nIt got to the point where he just ignored help desk team, they could never get him to recognize or fix anything, and nothing ever got escalated until some VP or director complained to $ITVP and then she'd push it down on him. Really, really dysfunctional.\n\nAfter I'd been there a couple weeks, I started to see the dynamic. $Red would ensconce himself in his office in the NOC, hiding from the world.  He would be visibly annoyed when people would come in to his \"realm\" uninvited.  Phone calls would go to voice mail and he'd verbally shoo any team members out of his office.\n\nAll of this encouraged me to plunk myself down in his office as frequently as possible to \"catch up\" or \"coordinate.\"  I just played the friendly goof co-worker who was socially inept and couldn't read his \"GTFO\" cues.  Instead of keeping him at arm's length, I'd pull him in closer and we'd all dance a technical tango. I mean, he'd been in the Coast Guard or the Air National Guard or something, so I *knew* the guy at least had some understanding of teamwork at least once in his misbegotten past. Aren't military guy's supposed to be team players?\n\nOne day, while shooting the breeze in his office, $Red shares that he'd been taking these assertiveness-type seminars for men. Real psycho-babble bullshit, I thought, but it shed some light on his dealings with $ITVP and what he did when he came into meetings, etc.\n\nHis takeaways from these training events were things like picking the \"power seat\" in a meeting, how to gain control of a conversation for your own benefit, and similar mumbo-jumbo shit.  Over the months, I paid more attention to what he did and how he acted in campus meetings and saw more and more of this sort of false-confidence projection, gamesmanship and him interjecting unnecessary contributions when they weren't needed just to change the focus. \n\nOne of the things he also said was that the reason he was always late to meetings with $ITVP was that it put her on the defensive and allowed him to \"control the agenda.\"  I remember thinking at the time \"No, $Red, all it does is make you a tardy dick.\" And he was always late to meetings. Every. Time.\n\nAnother thing was that he had zero respect for women in the workplace. This was a real problem since half my support team, and nearly half of the rest of the IT department and $ITVP (his boss and mine) were women. And if you've spent any time in higher ed, there are a lot of women who work at colleges.  I got the feeling he'd been an insecure child and a bully on the playground, using his size to make up for his lack of any sort of skills.\n\nThe day of $ITVP's last day at the college, $SeniorVP called a meeting for the whole IT department in our administration building on a Friday morning.\n\n$Red somehow thought he was going to become the new head of the IT department.  He showed up all smiles and puffed up, acting like today was his big break.  $SeniorVP talked about the departure of $ITVP and how things were going to change going forward. \n\nThen, $SeniorVP dropped the bomb: \"I've asked TheITCustodian to take over as the IT Director after $ITVP's departure. The IT department will report thru my office going forward. There will be no $ITVP.\"  \n\n$Red's reaction to this said a lot about how my future dealings with him would play out. He was visibly upset, his face grew redder and his body language was pure rage. I was checking his reaction out of the corner of my eye. He couldn't conceal his anger thru his poor attempt at remaining stone-faced. When it was over, and $SeniorVP asked if anybody had any questions or concerns, $Red said \"I want to schedule a time to talk to you.\"  When the meeting broke up, $Red snorted like a bull and walked out of the meeting without a word to anybody. Everybody in the department stood there in shock as he stalked out of the door. \n\nThat afternoon, after meeting with $SeniorVP, I sent out a calendar invite and an agenda to the entire IT Team to get together the following Monday at 10am for a meeting. I wanted to establish a weekly department meeting for all of us to get on the same page, communicate whats going on, etc, in a collaborative environment. Maybe take it to bi-weekly if we can get our planning horizon lifted to a 2-3 week range, but for now keep it at a week. \n\nOf course, $Red thought that kind of thing was all bullshit and a waste of his valuable time and wasted no small amount of electrons telling me so. He wanted to work all by himself, in the NOC, with nobody telling him what to do, with no interface to anybody.  \"Please keep paying me and sending my kids to college, and in return I'll keep your network barely running.\"\n\nMonday morning, one of my long-time support techs pulls me aside. \n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"Hey, just so you know, $Red is pissed about Friday.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"You think?\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"He's already said he's going to 'show TheITCustodian just who's **really** in charge in this department'.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"oh, really?\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"You know what that means. He'll show up late, for starters.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Yeah, I completely expected that. Thanks. See you at 10, OK? Don't be late.\"\n\nI walked around to the rest of the department and talked to everybody, made sure they knew to be ready to rock at 10. Under $ITVP, a department meeting starting 10 minutes late wasn't unusual, but that was usually because $ITVP was 5 minutes late and then $Red would show up 5 minutes after her. But I wanted to be sure to \"set the tone\" right out of the gate. I spent a few minutes with our database administrator, too.\n\nSure enough, 10am rolls around and 15 of us in the IT department are in the conference room, but no $Red.\n\n\"Ok, its 10am, lets get started. First agenda item..\"\n\nBy ten past, we're on Agenda item #4, having skipped items 2 &amp; 3 that belonged to $Red, when he loudly arrives, disrupting the meeting. But everyone turns to look at him, then turns back to me. He stands in the doorway, surveying the room. There, in his prized \"power seat,\" is our $DBA, a little 4' 10\" Indian lady. She's not looking at $Red at all. I see his eyes narrow. The only open seat in the room is two seats to my right along the conference table. Definitely the non-power seat.\n\n&gt;$Red: (indignantly) \"You started without me?\" \n\nI made a show of looking at my watch. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Its ten after, $Red. Meeting started at ten. There's 15 people in here who have things to do, so we got going.\"\n\n$Red grabs a chair off the back wall and wheels it around, attempting to shove it between $DBA and one of the HelpDeskTechs sitting next to her so he can claim the power position. $HelpDeskTech isn't having it. \"Go take that seat, $Red\" he whispers, pointing to the seat across the table and refusing to yield. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Alright, continuing on with item four..\"  \n\nI pointed to our $OracleLead to continue. \n\n$Red gives up and moves around the table to the empty chair and plops down with a dramatic sigh.\n\n$OracleLead continues with his item about their upcoming deployment.\n\n&gt;$Red: (interrupting) \"Wait, you're talking about the Oracle stuff already? What about **my** two agenda items?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"You weren't here, we skipped over them. We can circle back to them at the end of the agenda.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"But-\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$OracleLead?\"\n\nOut of the corner of my eye to the right, I can see $Red's face getting redder. Across the table, a couple seats to the right of the $OracleLead is $SupportTech. He's looking right at $Red and has this mirthful grin on his face. I don't even need to look at $Red, I can see the intended effect in $SupportTech's face.\n\nFinally we complete the other agenda items and get back to the first two. Its about 10:45, and I don't like meetings like this to last more than an hour, and I know that $Red tends toward pontification and self-aggrandizement and requires prompting to get to the point. Like \"Indiana Jones &amp; his whip\" prompting.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, so agenda item #2, cutover of the $Microsloth AftRear email security system during the Thursday night maintenance window. $Red, are we on track for this?\"\n\n$Red puffs himself up, clears his throat, and launches into this big long soliloquy about the status of the NOC and how everything is in tip-top shape.  This was his usual recap when $ITVP was in charge. It hardly changed week over week. It was his opportunity to tell everybody how great he was. Nothing more.\n\nTwo sentences in, I stop him.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Red, $Microsloth AftRear. Thats the agenda item. Whats the status of that project?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: (acting indignant once again) \"I was getting there!\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: (unprompted) \"**Before** we have to go to lunch?\"\n\nThe room doesn't quite erupt with laughter, but it may as well have. $Red's face turns redder.\n\n&gt;$Red: \"If I could continue without being interrupted... I'm thinking that we should cutover at about 1pm, so..\"\n\n&gt;$HelpDeskLead: (also unprompted) \"During the day? Why?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Well, so that we would have an opportunity to monitor the switchover and work through any issues during the business day when support is available..\"\n\n&gt;$HelpDeskLead: \"$MicroSloth support is 24-7. Why would you want to disrupt the *entire* campus's email system in the middle of the day when its use is at its **highest**? How about deploying at something like 6am, so we we can watch the traffic and still resolve any issues before the bulk of the users get going for the day?\"\n\nIts all I can do to not laugh. These are the kinds of things that each one of the departmental leads would talk about privately, but we could never get $ITVP to listen to, ever. The Oracle Team had to do its deployments at 11 o'clock at night. The InstructionalTechnology folks had to wait until classes were over for the day in a particular classroom to swap any tech out. The $WebGuy would deploy his updates when web usage was the lowest, usually after 11pm.\n\nBut $Red? He could take 2/3 of the campus out for a whole afternoon without so much as a \"how do you do?\" and it was \"the cost of doing business.\"\n\nBut hey, I'm a good guy. I figured I'd rescue $Red a little. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Red, $HelpDeskLead makes a great point. If we do a 6am cutover, that means we've got the whole morning to troubleshoot, most folks don't start to get in to the offices until 9, and all our traffic analysis shows the the majority of the student traffic is the highest after 3pm.  Really, 6am like $HelpDeskLead suggested is a nice happy medium: no need to stay late, late, we can troubleshoot any cutover issues while we're nice and fresh in the morning, and you get the opportunity to leave early.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Yeah, but, cutting over in the afternoon is how I've always done-\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$SeniorVP has already stated that he'd really like to see the IT deployment and maintenance windows have a minimum disruption to the campus community. We have over 1,200 students and over 200 faculty and staff relying on our services, and we have a fair understanding of the usage and traffic patterns to give us an idea of the \"quiet\" times on the network where our changes will disrupt the fewest people for the shortest amount of time. How are you fixed for the DNS for this switchover?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: (flustered that he's been redirected and told what to do) \"uhh, what do you mean, DNS?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"You'll have to make changes to the MX records to point at AftRear, right? Its Monday and you're planning for a Thursday cutover. Have you started to roll the TTL back?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: (tap dancing) \"Well, uh, yeah, I uhh, I cut the DNS time down to a day and a half last week.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Then why is our external DNS reporting that its still set for *three days*?\"\n\n(When dealing with people like $Red, I learned a long time ago that its usually a good idea to not ask them questions you don't already mostly have answers to, and let them dig their own graves. Its like watching a good episode of Law &amp; Order.

Do we need to reschedule for Friday? Assuming you can change the DNS between now and lunch...\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"uh, well, I'm uh, yeah, I think I can do that, sure.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I'll move the cutover to Friday at 6am this one time, and I'll get the notification out to the campus community.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"I normally make those notifications.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Not any more. Campus wide communications from the IT department will be coordinated thru me from now on.\"\n\n$Red is getting redder again.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"6am Friday it is.  Make the TTL changes today and then again Wednesday and Thursday morning and Thursday night and we should be all turned down to 15 minutes or so by then, right?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: (Confused) \"Uh, yeah, I think so..\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, nothing more for Agenda Item #2? Agenda Item #3, the firewall update. How soon do we need to deploy this?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: (shuffling his papers) \"I, uhhh, its. Uh.. I think. Friday at noon?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$Red?\"\n\nHe looks up at me, and he's starting to get pissed again.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Low impact maintenance windows?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Uh, how about. How about at the same time we do the AftRear cutover?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Two changes at once?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Yeah. I can handle it.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No. You can do it Saturday at 6am, or Tuesday at 6am. Your choice.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: (realizing he's not going to win this) \"Uhhh, how about Tuesday?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, I'll get preliminary word out on that to the VPs and Directors and final coordination after next Monday's meeting.  Anything else, $Red?\"\n\n(he's back to huffing and puffing, and leans back with his arms crossed)\n\n&gt;$Red: \"No.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Anybody else?\" (a sea of people shaking their heads) \"Good. See everybody here next Monday. 10am.\"\n\n$Red jumped up and ran for the door so fast I though he might have been ill. \n\ntl;dr $Red can't handle the heat, can't get out of the kitchen",

It's important to note that the first two in the list (i.e. me) do not have access to $RIS. Access is confined to the company MD, the head of the DevOps team, and of course, $CEO.\n\nThis afternoon, shortly before 4PM, a Slack notification pops up. I've been pulled into a chat between $CEO and $WTL. And yes, this is how the conversation starts:\n\n&gt;$CEO: BTW, I've just added $CDNProvider to $ourCompanyWebsite - the content still comes from the same $RIS bucket, but note that there's a need to do an invalidation once you update\n\n$WTL walks over to my desk, somewhat confused.\n\n&gt;$WTL: er, any idea why I got sent that message? I thought $RIS was your department  \n&gt;$me: I was going to ask you the same, nobody ever gave me $RIS access...  \n\n$WTL pulls out his phone and checks the company website.\n\n&gt;$WTL: hang on, it's not working... er, we seem to get a redirect loop here, is that just the internal thing?  \n&gt;$me: &lt;pulls up an SSH terminal to an external server, `curl`'s the homepage&gt; nope, nothing but 301's externally as well  \n&gt;$WTL: uh-oh\n\n$WTL walks back to his desk. I lock my machine and follow. $WTL has called over $PM and is showing him that our site is completely down. $PM walks into $CEO's office. I follow as I figure I should be involved in this.\n\n$CEO has the $RIS console open and is completely unaware anything is broken. But sure enough, he has misconfigured something. About 10 minutes of trial and error with me and $PM looking over his shoulder later, $CEO sets it up correctly. For good measure, I then restart all our internal DNS servers to clear their caches (in the process, I discover one of the machines has failed in a very odd way, good thing it was brought to my attention).\n\nMy conclusion on Slack:\n\n&gt;$me: can i recommend we don't do that again? :)\n\nTL;DR - all major website changes should be made immediately in production by the highest authority in the company and THEN disseminated to people who might have a clue what they're doing...",

This is normally down to the hardware needing replacement, as the contract has been going on for over a decade. Because there are 2/3 of us in the country who manage these particular clinics we're a little reluctant to travel out to them and will always try to resolve problems over the phone.*\n\n**$ME**: Me\n\n**$SH**: My southern hardware tech counterpart/1st Line Support.\n\n**$NS**: Nursing staff working at the clinic.\n\n&gt;$SH: Got a hardware job for you to do, sounds like the clinic is having some problems with their peripherals.\n\n&gt;$ME: Peripherals aren't normally a big issue, what are they complaining about?\n\n&gt;$SH: When they log in they're hearing the *Windows Ding.wav* on repeat, and they have IE sessions launch constantly, they can't look at the desktop or click anything, including items in the start.\n\n&gt;$ME: Seems odd but it will just be a peripheral fault, they've checked the cables and stuff right? If they unplug each one they'll eventually figure out the faulty item and we'll send them a new one. \n\n&gt;$SH: Erm, well no - I've been trying to talk them through it but they're reluctant to touch anything. \n\n&gt;$ME: Well it's our kit, if they break it we replace it anyway - so whats the deal.\n\n&gt;$SH: She's really adamant she doesn't want to touch any of it, she says she doesn't even know why we installed the machine.\n\n&gt;$ME: Oh, shes one of those... Can local IT not check it out, we can post the replacement stuff out for them.\n\n&gt;$SH: I asked if their local IT would come in but they're based offsite and can't spare anybody til later this week.\n\n&gt;$ME: You're really going to make me drive 100+ miles to go solve a peripheral fault? \n\n*he did* \n\nI never mind going to these clinics because it's always nice to get away from the office, the staff at these clinics are usually super nice and the company pays me by the mile. \n\nI arrive at the clinic and get directed to the treatment room where we have the setup, standard desk keyboard and mouse. I turn on the machine and log in, the computer starts screeching *Windows Ding.wav* at me full volume, I try to much the volume but every time I open the volume panel it closes itself, all the while internet explorer is launching itself. \n\n&gt;$NS: See this is what I was talking about, they're no good these machines, they put them in and all they do is slow your job down! \n\n&gt;$ME: Well lets take a look and see whats going on. \n\nI power down the machine and pull it out from its enclosure, there are normally 5 cables, 2 x Network, Keyboard, Mouse, Power. There are 6 plugged in. I sigh knowing full well what I'm about to find. \n\nI trace the 3 USB cables to their device, the first is the mouse on the desk, second I follow to the keyboard on the desk. I look at the third, and wonder what could possibly be at the other end. I follow the cable round the back of the desk, it then leaves the desk goes along the wall to a small cabinet, I try to open the cabinet but it's locked. I ask $NS if she has a key. She opens the cabinet and I see a stack of files and folders of patient data, I carefully move them trying not to cause some kind of paperwork catastrophe for the site, and find a regular old dell keyboard at the bottom of the pile, keys facing up, covered in paperwork. Obviously this was just constantly firing inputs and causing their issues. \n\nSomebody, possibly her, had moved a \"spare\" keyboard into a nearby cabinet, but left it plugged in, and they were slowly piling up paperwork on top of it. Nobody had questioned the wire trailing or questioned why there were 2 peripherals but only 3 cables. The job took around 10 minutes to resolve, and around 2 hours to get to. \n\n**tl:dr** I drove 100 miles on company dime to unplug a 2nd keyboard.",

        "text": "This is a story that happened a few years ago in my previous job as helpdesk support. The company sold and installed custom audio hardware, basically a pc playing preset backgroundmusic. Any other audio equipment was usually the responsibility of the client themselves. On occasion we also provided the amplifier or speakers. Some of our clients were chains of stores with their own techs, but usually clients called us if there were issues with the music because our number was on a label on our players.\n\nAbout 2/3 of the calls were classic, \"have you tried turning it off and on again\". But some of them were a bit different. \n$Me - obviously me, $C - Client.\n\n$Me: &gt;Hi this is $Me from $Company, how can i help?\n\n$C: &gt;Hi, we have a problem with our music, it is playing but we hear a continuous beep as well.\n\n$Me: &gt;Ok, can you move to our player and can you see what's on the display?\n\n$C: &gt;Sure, I'll have to walk there first, if you have a moment?\n\n$Me: &gt;No problem.\n\n\nAt this point $C mutes the mic, and I'm trying to find out which hardware they usually have at that store, and find documentation on the amplifier, not provided by us. This amplifier is like a beast compared to what most clients have. It was a Voice Alarm Controller which doubles as amplifier. \n\nSuddenly some mumbling comes through, along with a loud beeping noise in the background:\n\n$C: &gt;Hi sir, can you understand me?\n\n$Me: &gt;Barely, can you see what is on the display of our player?\n\n$C: &gt;I can't understand you, but this is the noise we're getting!\n\n\n$C moves her mobile phone straight on the amplifier and the beep is like an airhorn being blown straight into my headset. I tore it off and could still hear the beeping for several seconds until it starts to fade a bit so i put my headset back on.\n\n$C: &gt;Did you hear the noise?\n\n$Me: &gt;Yes, and I can confirm that it isn't our player making that noise. Can you try to unplug the amplifier from the power and reconnecting it after 15 minutes? It should start without that noise.\n\n$C: &gt;Ok, and if not can we call you back?\n\n$Me: &gt;No, this seems to be an issue with your hardware, you will have to contact $ClientsownTechSupport\n\n\nDid not hear back from them, but I had to take a break after that call and go to a quiet room in our office to calm my ear. I did still hear a ringing noise for a couple of hours, but it stopped later that evening. The only other time I've ever had something similar was after an ACDC concert where i forgot my earplugs.",

        "text": "At last month's Repair Café, an angry looking man came in. Unfortunately for him, we always have more repairs than we can handle (even though we have a massive ~30 volunteers), so after signing in he had to wait about half an hour.\n\nAs I sent my previous repair on their way, the guy stalks to my table. In broken Dutch, he goes \n\n&gt; \"My computer broken! You must fix!\"  \n\nAt this point I'm assuming that the guy is just frustrated with the wait, and his lack of Dutch skills might make him come off a lot more rude than he meant to be, I try to figure out what's wrong.\n\n&gt; \"What exactly is wrong with your computer? Can you show me?\"  \n\n&gt; \"Computer at my home!\"\n\nUmm... that's not very helpful. Our Repair Café only takes place once a month, and everyone usually brings their stuff to have it fixed. I mean, I know anyone with a tiny bit of tech knowledge is often seen as a tech wizard, but unfortunately telepathy and telekineses are beyond me.\n\n&gt; \"Could you bring in your pc? I'd gladly look at it for you.\"  \n\n&gt; \"NO! You must come to my house!\"\n\nNow, we're all volunteers, and we don't do house calls. This is both for safety reasons, and because we don't want this volunteering to feel more like an obligation to spend time fixing things without pay outside of the Repair Café. That, and we don't want to compete with local repair businesses.\n\n&gt; \"I'm sorry, I can't do that, we don't do house calls. If you can't bring it in, you can either bring it in next month, or you can describe the problem in detail so I can instruct you on how to fix it at home.\"  \n\n&gt; \"YOU COME TO MY HOUSE TODAY!\"  \n\nAt this point, I'd had enough. I have no idea why he was so adament about me coming to his house. I suspect it was just laziness and not wanting to bring in the pc, but who knows? In the end I asked for the guy's e-mail address so I could give it to a guy who actually does (paid) house calls. This was a challenge as well as the guy demanded I give him the phone number of the repairman, but I refused as I won't give out anyone's phone number without their permission, and especially not to weird and rude people.\n\nWhat's funny is that these few weirdoes and rude people we get in (probably less than like 0.5% of people) make us all appreciate the normal people that come in so much more. There are so many good stories there. No matter how stupid the question, how complicated or easy the fix, as long as people are friendly, fixing things with them is a real joy. If you ask me, that's the best part about tech support :)",

So, to install a PC remote, I need some hands on help from users (a short 6 point list which basically is starting network boot and then clicking next, naming PC, next again, done). I have pre-authorized the installation in SCCM, so there really isn't anything besides the 6 point list for the users to do. This happened today and it all started after I sent the install list to the user who was receiving a new PC. I will be $Tech, problem user will be $PU.\n\nSilence for 24 hours, after constant bitching about getting a new PC, and once it finally arrives.\nThis is a mail conversation.\n\n&gt;$Tech: So, did you start the installation? I can't see that it finished.\n\n&gt;$PU: No, we couldn't make it work. Can't you do it from your PC, and also add my printer? I also haven't been able to get my signature into my emails.\n\nPlease note that this contact is ONLY about installing his new PC.\n\n&gt;$Tech: No, I can't do it remotely, it requires a hands on. Where did you get stuck, which step of the guide?\n\n&gt;$PU: We just couldn't get it to work. I thought I had added $CRM_system as well, but when I came home and tried to login to $CRM_system from my home office, I got the error message \"not secure\" and was sent back to starting page. I also cannot get the monitor to work with my keyboard, I never got it to work. BUT, I can come by your office on Friday, I bring everything, and we fix it there? It would be a great help to me.\n\nAt this point I am confused AF. I did his original PC, which he claims is not working. I know $CRM_system is working fine from his PC. Also, keyboard to monitor??? I am really confused and I am thinking he is still talking about his old PC.\n\n&gt;$Tech: I am talking about your new PC that is delivered to $Company_Office, and the installation for it. I haven't even seen you started it? (I can see that in the logs)\n\n&gt;$PU: That's the one I am talking about, but as I said last we spoke, I am really bad at this, therefore I request your assistance, and I come to your office on Friday?\n\nAt this point, I've given up and simply respond he can come to the office on Friday. I explained the situation to my manager, who berated me for not including pictures in my 6 step guide.\n\nThe ~~customer~~ user is always right, yeah?",

        "text": "A comment I made one of the posts reminded me of this short little anecdote.\n\nI got a request from this guy I knew in high school, so it was (kind of) in good faith. It was an older MacBook Pro and I had told him beforehand that I wasn't terribly skilled with Mac in general, but he insisted I try since no one else he knew could fix it. He also insisted this was a \"lawyer's laptop\". He bothered me about it for the first few days, but then after that, it was total silence for **three years**.\n\nOf course, I eventually forgot about it, since it kind of got semi-buried under the piles of other stuff that end up on my couch and one day while cleaning, I found it again. Now, three years is a long time and I had gotten a new phone, same number, but his number was long gone from my contacts.\n\nI find the laptop while cleaning, recognize it and do some fixing up figuring that this dude has long since forgotten about it. I get a charger for it since he never provided one and try to boot it up to no avail.  Once I change the memory, and HD though, the little laptop springs to life. I install OSX and I figure I may as well either use it or pawn it off. \n\nFor context, the MacBook was probably about [5 or 6 years old](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/jUFDvEgjpksEQrDP.standard) at that point and it's pretty beat up.\n\nA few days later I get a text from an unknown number asking if the laptop was done. It didn't take long for me to realize who it was though. I'm sitting here thinking WTF, how did he know? Especially since I wiped the laptop completely clean. After that initial feeling though, I was kind of disappointed since it was a decent laptop, but I told him to come and pick it up\n\nHe comes next day and what ensued was a shitstorm of the guy trying to get the laptop back for free, citing me keeping his laptop for so long and not doing anything to it. I did keep it, but do you really expect me to remember after having had it sitting there for that long? Surely, **someone** would have come knocking or followed-up. \n\nI got him to cave and pay up for fixing it, but how it didn't occur to him to try an Apple Store is still beyond me.\n\n#####TL;DR#####\n\nDude drops off a laptop for me to fix, doesn't say a word for three years and expects everything for free.\n\n**EDIT: Fixed some formatting**\n\n**EDIT: I should clarify since I'm getting a lot of comments about this. I didn't charge him for the repair, I charged him for the parts. Also, the user dropped it off with me, I did not take the laptop and I should also note that this was several years ago by this point.**",

WHY DOES NOTHING WORK AROUND HERE?!?). I discreetly cut off my department head explaining \"Sorry to cut you off, but I think there's an emergency trying to happen.\"\n\n&gt;$B: Do we know if faxes are working?\n\n&gt;$me: I've received no alerts from the phone system so I assume so. Would you like me to check?\n\n&gt;$B: If you could, please do. $U is throwing a fit and is raising a stink.\n\n&gt;$me: No worries, I got this.\n\nI sent two faxes to each of our fax lines from a cloud hosted fax service, all of which come through. So I give $U a call to come by and talk through the problem.\n\n&gt;$me: So, would you please tell me what was faxed and when?\n\n&gt;$U: They've been sending it for the past two weeks and they say that it's on my end. How are you going to fix it?\n\n&gt;$me: Well, I ran some tests, and all faxes are flowing through just fine. *calmly passes faxes I received*\n\n&gt;$U: No, this is wrong, something's wrong. I had it sent to the main fax line. You need to fix it now!\n\n&gt;$me: *keeping a cool, level head* No, I'm afraid all our systems are running fine. *moves monitor to show and explain that all fax lines are clear and waiting for Tx/Rx*\n\n&gt;$U: That doesn't mean SH-T to me! Something is broken and you need to fix this clusterf-ck NOW!!!\n\n&gt;$me: *refraining from throat-punching this assjar* This means that all faxes are open and waiting to be used. This log says that two faxes were received a half hour ago, per my testing, and until then, the last one was received Friday at around 4. Can you direct me to the person or people who are trying to send you these faxes? That way I can work with them and fix this problem a lot faster.\n\n&gt;$U: THIS IS F-CKING BULLSH-T!!! I JUST WANT ONE GODDAMN THING TO WORK RIGHT FOR ONCE AND YOU JUST SIT THERE ASKING QUESTIONS!!! WHO THE F-CK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DEALING WITH?? **HUH???**\n\n&gt;$me: *looking for a sharp object while trying to maintain eye contact* I'm sorry, but unless I know the source and who they are and what they're trying to send over, there's not much anyone can do for you. Here, let's call HR and see if they know anything.\n\n&gt;$U: *suddenly calm* HR? What can they do? (we have a VERY strict policy on using company equipment)\n\n&gt;$me: Well, if the fax was sent to them by mistake, then they can give those documents to you.\n\n&gt;$U: *curtly* They didn't go to HR.\n\n&gt;$me: *raises eyebrow* I'm simply eliminating all factors here, human or machine error. So what was the document you were looking for?\n\n&gt;$U: Oh, nothing important.\n\n&gt;$me: *internal evil grin slowly appears* Please, I need to know so that I figure out if there's a problem or not.\n\n&gt;$U: Let's go to my desk. I have the information on my screen.\n\n&gt;$me: *at $U's desk* Okay, so let's see what you got.\n\n&gt;$U: I'm at this screen and I've been trying to send the faxes from here. But everytime I send them, it says they were sent with no errors. I've called their tech support, but they say the faxes were received. So what's up, is our fax system just telling them they came through and not printing them out or what?\n\n&gt;$me: *looking at his tax return information* Um, we have three problems here.\n\n&gt;$U: FINALLY! Okay, so what's up?\n\n&gt;$me: The fax number you're trying to send them to goes into an email queue that logs and retains each fax, but doesn't print; they get emailed to a group that includes all of finance, our GM, and the head of finance in HQ.\n\n&gt;$U: *turns white as a ghost* Oh, crap.\n\n&gt;$me: Yeah, there's a really strict guideline on sending and receiving faxes, so that's the second problem. If they were to get this info, you'd have already heard about it.\n\n&gt;$U: *swallows hard*\n\n&gt;$me: But like I said before, we have not received anything since Friday, and certainly nothing with that subject line.\n\n&gt;$U: Whew. Okay, so where did they go.\n\n&gt;$me: *squints and looks at the destination number* Well, you got the phone number right for the main fax, but that's not the correct area code. Ours is *xxx* where you sent it to *yyy*.\n\n&gt;$U: So where did they go?\n\n&gt;$me: I have no idea, but figuring that they were received at that area code and phone number combination, I would wager a guess that this number goes to a fax machine and it received your documents.\n\n$U goes silent for a few minutes, then I ask, \"Would you like me to see if I can track that number down for you?\"\n\n&gt;$U: No, I don't have time. I need to go to the bank now. Thanks for your help. *grabs coat and cell phone, places a hurried call, and runs out the door*\n\nI went into $B's office.\n\n&gt;$B: Did you figure it out.\n\n&gt;$me: Yeah. $U was trying to fax his taxes to our main fax line.\n\n&gt;$B: Yikes. So why weren't they going through?\n\n&gt;$me: $U was sending them to the wrong area code, and that number received every copy he sent.\n\n&gt;$B: *thinks for a minute, then shakes head and sighs* Okay, make a note in the ticket, then go ahead and close it.\n\nTL,DR: Angry asshole of a user yells at IT because user sent tax return information to the wrong number and it was confirmed as received.\n\nThanks for reading, I'll be at the bar till my next shift starts.\n\nEDIT: grammar and punctuation",

The entire school is networked together with LAN switches taped to the walls in the hall, with ethernet cables strung between them. None of these cables are covered and they're all tangled together. Luckily I'm not dealing with those today.\n\nI get to the class and the teacher points me to the fourth row of 5. Apparently all the computers on this row have no internet connection. Odd.\n\nI check the LAN switch, and everything is plugged in, flashing green lights galore.      I pull the power cable, wait a sec, plug it back in, nothing.\n\nEach row has it's own 8 port LAN switch, except the first row which has a 12 port. All the latter rows are plugged into the first switch, and the 6 computers on each row go into that row's switch, leaving every switch with an empty port. Don't ask why they didn't just plug each row into the one behind it, but honestly the system is so messed up it doesn't even matter. After 5-10 minutes of tracing cables I find the problem.\n\nThe cable from the first row to row 4 isn't plugged in to the row 1 switch. Plug it in, all is good.\n\nFlash forward to the next day. Row 4 is down. Spend a couple minutes basic troubleshooting, raise an eyebrow and check the cable. Unplugged.\n\nNext day. Row 4? Down. Immediately go to the cable, unplugged.\n\nThis continues for 2 more days until I give an announcement to the class not to unplug the cable, and instruct the teacher to do so with the rest of their classes. \n\nRow 4 never went down again. Who was unplugging the cable, and what the hell did they think they were accomplishing? We shall never know.\n\nTL;DR: Someone keeps unplugging a single Ethernet cable out of 39. Why? Because users are dumb, or students are jerks. Idk.\n\nEDIT1: [Here](https://i.imgur.com/SmvoeZs.jpg) is the setup.\n\nEDIT2: AHHHH SOMEONE DID IT AGAIN",

She's been using computers for years, and she keeps talking about some new gadget or gizmo that will \"make [her] part of the 21st Century!\" Spoiler Alert: They never do. Still, my sister and I figured that she could use a new machine, something to take to the library, something relatively inexpensive, but certainly much better than the computer she currently has. \n\n\n\n\nSo, come Christmas, we give my aunt the new laptop and she loves it. She wants help setting it up, and I walk her through the start up, make the account, get the basic functionality together. I make sure she can log on before I leave for college at the end of winter break and tell her again that the laptop must be regularly plugged in to work. She nods, says she understands everything, and I leave, confident that even my aunt can now handle the laptop.\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the narrator says: *He thought too soon...*\n\n\n\n\nI'm back at college for a few weeks, when my mum calls and keeps me up to date about what's going on at home. Apparently, my aunt's laptop is broken. I sigh, ask what's wrong? Mum doesn't know, she just says that my aunt says the laptop is broken and can't figure it out. I'm not getting anywhere with my mum, and my aunt is useless when it comes to describing her problems with technology, so I just resign myself to figuring it out when I get home.\n\n\n\n\nSpring break rolls around and I get home again, and one of the first things I do is ask my aunt about the laptop. I head over to her place and ask for details. Apparently it won't start. I ask if she's plugged it in and kept it charged and she says she has, but something else is wrong. Now I'm a bit more curious.\n\n\n\n\nI go to the laptop, press the power button, it boots up instantly. I look to her and she says \"How did you do that?\"\n\n\n\n\n\"I pressed the power button.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Well I pressed every button on there, and I didn't see one that said 'on.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\"It's right here.\" I point to the button with the power symbol on it. My aunt leans down looks at it then says something I will never forget.\n\n\n\n\n\"u/egotistical-dso that's a Q! What is that supposed to be?! Quon?! Is that it?! QUON?!\"\n\n\n\n\nShe then proceeds to have what I can only describe as a minor mental breakdown, yelling over me as I try to explain what the power symbol is while she just keeps yelling \"quon!\" After a few minutes I just take the laptop and leave. I still have it to this day.",

        "text": "One fine spring Wednesday afternoon, I'd just come back to my office at $MidwestCollege with a sandwich from the local shoppe and I settled in to drink my Diet Coke, eat my sandwich and Cheetos and maybe surf the web for a few minutes. Its pretty quiet, but I do notice that the help desk line is ringing a fair bit. (its being answered over in the help desk, so the ringing isn't a cause for concern. There is some ebb &amp; flow to the calls...pretty normal)\n\nSince my office was in an academic building at $MidwestCollege, I got a lot of faculty traffic from instructors who work in the building. \n\nThree bites into my pastrami on rye, one of the profs stormed in to my office, pitching a complete fit. I'm talking nearly frothing at the mouth, can't-get-a-word-in-edgewise agitated.\n\n&gt;$Prof: \"IT is deliberately trampling on academic freedom and student's rights!\"  \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Whoa, hold on a minute. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure whatever it was isn't deliberate. Sit down for a second, tell me what the problem is and we'll get to the bottom of it together.\"\n\n$Prof sits in one of my guest chairs and calms down (I had a pretty good relationship with this prof, but she did have a minor tendency to fly off the handle a *little*. I capitalized on my friendly nature with her to talk her off the ledge and find out what the root problem was). \n\n$Prof taught a lot of courses on Human Sexuality and Feminism and such on the campus. She was also the advisor to the campus LBGTQ student organizaton. Within minutes of the new firewall being put on line the day before, a bunch of the students in her classes and the organizaton couldn't get to any of the websites they normally went to. That morning, they came to her complaining that they were suddenly being blocked by IT.\n\n&gt;$Prof: \"Type in [something relatively sexual, but benign for a higher education campus. Not porn, but sexuality] on your web browser.\"\n\nI get a SonicWall error message about \"Content blocked by policy.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Uhhhh... crap. Let me get to the bottom of this.\"\n\nOf course, $Prof's first reaction was to assume a nefarious intent on the part of IT. But if you've read my other stories about $Red the network administrator, you'll know that [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) was in full effect.\n\nThe previous morning, on a Tuesday probably around 10:30, $Red had finally deployed our new SonicWALL firewall that he'd been working on for weeks.  Could he deploy it, say, after hours or on a weekend? Nope, can't have that. Might impact $Red's burgeoning social calendar.  His deployment and maintenance windows were *always* in the middle of the day, at a time of *his* convenience and not anybody else.  And $ITVP didn't even think this was a problem, even when other VPs are calling her complaining about their department's ability to get work done because the network just randomly stops working with no warning.\n\nAs you would expect, $Red had put next to *zero* effort effort in thinking this firewall implementation through. And even less effort communicating it with his colleagues in IT and the college community. \n\nImmediately after $Red made the switch Tuesday morning, middle of our workday, email in and out of the campus went completely on the fritz for almost  2 hours. It took him that long to sort out the port forwarding. The Learning Management System was inaccessible for even longer than that because $Red wouldn't admit he didn't quite know what he was doing and had no idea how to solve the LMS http forwarding.\n\nFinally, about 4pm I was pretty sure $Red was going to go home and leave the LMS dead in the water and hundreds of students screaming for help. I showed him how to allow the http traffic for the LMS thru the firewall to the appropriate host.  (mind you: I'd never worked with a SonicWALL before, that was my \"15 minutes in the manual\" and showing him what to do. Which was probably 14 more minutes that he'd spent with the manual.)\n\nAs was $Red's custom, he put absolutely no thought in to how our environment in higher ed is different from a business as far as Content Filtering and whats \"acceptable.\" So he just left Content Filtering on its default out-of-the-box \"business\" settings. \n\nBy default, that filtered out dozens of categories and hundreds upon hundreds of websites you wouldn't want in a business setting, including things like \"abortion,\" \"adult/mature content,\" \"alcohol/tobacco,\" \"chat/instant messaging,\" \"cult/occult,\" \"drugs/illegal drugs,\" \"political,\" \"religion,\" \"sex education,\" \"social networking,\" \"violence, hate &amp; racism,\" etc. Where previously we'd been wide-open and unfiltered, now folks were being blocked and the natives were getting restless.\n\nBy mid-morning on Wednesday, ground swell of hate &amp; discontent was growing and approaching a crescendo. And then I had faculty in my office out for blood. I checked with the help desk. At least half the calls they were getting were related to the Content Filtering, and $Red wasn't even answering his phone when the helpdesk called him.\n\nI went to $Red's office in the NOC. There he was, placidly staring at his laptop screen (I think that expression was him patiently watching the clock on the taskbar) like there was nothing going on. But there *was* something going on. \n\n&gt;$Me: \"$Red, Jesus, the help desk can't get in touch with you, they've got a couple dozen help desk calls complaining about the content filtering.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"So? Let the little criminals deal with it.\" (he crosses his arms, his \"I'm not discussing this further\" gesture). \"I'm not going to loosen up these restrictions and let them get away with whatever they want!\"\n\nI could feel my blood pressure rising, but I forced myself to stay calm.  \n\n&gt;$Me: \"$Red, do you not understand that whats acceptable in a higher education environment is different than the default business settings?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"So you just want to turn it off to satisfy the masses?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, but there's got to be some kind of middle ground. We're blocking stuff that hasn't been blocked before, and people need to get to that stuff for academic reasons. I just had $Prof in my office and she was pissed. Plus, dammit, I can't get to fark.com.\"\n\nJust that moment, $Red's phone rings. \n\n&gt;$Red: (groaning) \"Oh, great, its $ITVP.\" (picking up the phone) \"$Red speaking.\"\n\nI can't hear what she's saying, but I see his expression change. I'm guessing that $Prof went to $ITVP and bent her ear quite a bit after she left my office. $Prof's office was in the same building as $ITVP.\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Of course.. Yes.. Well, you know that we've never really content filtered before, just blocked P2P and.. uh huh... yeah. No, thats the way it came... Uh huh... I suppose I could... what? No.. Uh..\" (looks at me) \"Yeah, TheITCustodian is here...  uh huh, just a minute ago... right... Ok, but if the little cri- the students start getting into things they shouldn't, I'm not responsible...\"\n\nHe hangs the phone up.\n\n&gt;$Red: \"$ITVP wants me turn off the Content Filter all together. Says she had $Prof in her office standing on a chair or something..\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Thats what I'm trying to tell you. Look, there's a better way here. Lets leave the Content Filter on, but turn down everything but things like kiddie porn and obvious illegal stuff like hacking and cracking and that sort of thing.  That should make $Prof, $ITVP, and all the students who need to get at filtered content for school reasons happy, you think?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"If this screws up, I'm blaming you.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Whatever. Lets just do it.\"\n\nTogether, we went into the Content Filter and loosened the restrictions considerably but left in place the stuff we'd talked about. He bitched and complained the whole time about \"the little criminals\" getting to do whatever they wanted on his network.  Truth be told, they weren't getting to do all that much more than they already had. And its not like he was doing any serious traffic management anyway.\n\nLater that day, when I wrote up a ticket to lump all the help desk tickets under, it read something like \n\n**Problem:** \"Professor complained that new firewall Content Filtering rules block legitimate LGBTQ and sexual education websites for students, staff and faculty.\" \n\n**Notes:** \"$NetworkAdministrator implemented new Internet firewall with default business-appropriate Content Filter rules which were not appropriate for higher education. Explained to $NetworkAdministrator things like academic freedom and the need for students, staff &amp; faculty to access content in an educational setting that is different from a business. $NetworkAdministrator failed to coordinate the overall implementation of next generation firewall with advanced capabilities like traffic shaping and Content Filtering with both the rest of the IT department and the broader campus community, resulting a 2+ hour long email outage, a day-long LMS outage, and yet another black eye for IT.\"\n\n**Cause code:** \"Administrator Induced\"\n\n**Resolution:** \"With $NetworkAdministrator, adjusted Content Filter to only remove those things blatantly illegal, fixed http forwarding.\"\n\ntl;dr $Red the Network Admin does zero homework, locks down the campus like East Germany, acts like its still not his problem.\n\n[EDIT: formatting of the help desk entry &amp; a word]",

        "text": "  \nAbout 6-7 years ago I was about 4-5 months in at a new company. We were receiving a lot of spoofed emails and I was asked to look into it . Up until that point email had not been my responsibility.  \n  \nSetting up a SPF record fixed the issue immediately, but ended up causing one of the most frustrating series of conversations I’ve had while working in the IT field. (Some background, basically a SPF record is a text document anyone who has a domain can setup that tells other domains the following. Legit emails from @MyCompaniesDomain.com will only come from the following places, disregard emails with our name received from elsewhere.)\n   \nA few weeks after our spoofing issue was taken care of, I got a call from a coworker in sales letting me know that he’s not getting all of the emails a vendor is sending him and we’ve lost a few sales because of it. I ask for the vendor email account in question and start doing some digging. At first I had trouble even finding a problem in the logs, anything coming from the vendor’s domain is coming through fine.  Eventually I just had the vendor go through the entire ordering process while on the phone with them and yet again I saw nothing from their domain… I ended up just checking everything that had just been sent to the destination address and that’s when I saw it. An email sent to our salesman that claimed to be from our salesman. In short our vendor’s ERP(business system) was spoofing our employees email addresses during the ordering process.  After I stopped laughing I asked to be transferred to someone in their IT dept.  assuming they’d be able to solve the issue pretty quickly. I mean.. they couldn’t be aware of it right?\n  \nMe: Hello, I wanted to talk to someone in your dept. about an issue we’re having with emails sent from your ERP system. It looks like for some reason your system is spoofing the email address of whichever of our employee’s is working with your company on an order during any correspondence after an order has been generated. \n  \n&gt; V-IT1(Vendor IT tier 1):  Right, It’s supposed to do that.   \n  \n&gt; Me: Wait, what? What do you mean it’s supposed to do that.   \n  \n&gt; V-IT1: Yea that’s how our system sends out emails, how else is it supposed to work. If your having a problem, just whitelist the email address in question.   \n  \n&gt; Me: … Can I speak to your boss please.   \n  \nTo save time, I get transferred to the next tier and explain the situation again.   \n  \n&gt; V-IT2(Vendor IT tier 2): Oh yea. Every once in a while a customer will call in with this problem. All you need to do is whitelist the email address that is getting blocked.   \n  \n&gt; Me: You can’t be serious.. So your solution is for your customers to whitelist their entire sales teams. This of course would open the door to spammers.   \n  \n&gt; V-IT2: Yes it’s the only way to fix your problem and if you had proper spam filtering software it wouldn’t be an issue.   \n  \n&gt; Me: You do realize that it’s actually not our problem. Your company is basically ignoring industry standards and is practically acting as a spammer by sending out spoofed emails.   \n  \n&gt; V-IT2: We’re not ignoring any standards and if you’re just going not going to use the solution I gave you, then there isn’t anything else I can do to help you.   \n  \n&gt; Me: Do you have an Admin that you can transfer me to.   \n  \nAgain to save time. I get transferred to the “Sysadmin” and explain the situation once again.   \n  \n&gt;  Me: Also, the other people I spoke to in IT are telling me that I just need to whitelist OUR own email addresses, which is.. to be honest just ridiculous.   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin(Vendor Sysadmin): I see. Well we’ve been your vendor for years and this has never been an issue before. Nothing has chanced on our end so is there anything that’s changed on your end.   \n  \n&gt;  Me: I’m not sure what this has to do with anything but yes. I was asked to look into an email spoofing issue we were having and implemented SPF a few weeks ago.   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin: Well there you go, you must have misconfigured them or else you wouldn’t be having this problem.   \n  \n&gt; Me: … … .. I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that you didn’t setup or even manage your companies email. Could I speak to whoever does.   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin:  I’m not sure what good that would do, I’ve already told you what you needed in order to fix it.   \n  \n&gt; Me: Sir as the person who manages our companies email server I can assure you that your solution is not possible. In the interest of coming up with a solution that benefits both our companies I’d appreciate it if you could at least humor me.   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin: …. Alright. Our email is managed by a service provider. I’ll arrange a 3-way call, does that work for you?   \n  \n&gt; Me: That sounds great. Thank you.   \n  \nWhile waiting for the call I made a change so that every single spoofed email came to me so that I could manually sort through them in the meantime, so that nothing else got missed.  \n  \nA few days later I was included in the promised 3-way call, and again to save time I explained the situation again to the two of them.    \n  \n&gt; MSP-IT(Vendor’s Managed service provider): Hate to say it V-Admin, but he’s right, just adding his co-workers email addresses to a white list isn’t a viable option.   \n  \n&gt; Me: Thank you!   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin: Hmm, is that so. Well what do you recommend.   \n  \n&gt; MSP-IT: He’s going to have to add your email servers outbound IP to his SPF record.   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin: That works.  \n  \n&gt; Me: Wait what… Uhm you can’t be serious.   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin: *sighs*   \n  \n&gt; MSP-IT: Well there’s unfortunately no other solution.  \n   \n&gt; Me: Sure there is. V-Admin’s ERP system can stop spoofing our domain’s email addresses.   \n  \n&gt; MSP-IT: Well that would work to but we unfortunately don’t manage V-Admin’s ERP system, that would be up to him.   \n  \n&gt; V-Admin: I’ve heard enough. Thank you MSP-IT you were very helpful. Sir I do manage our ERP system, it’s always worked this way and I will not be making any changes.  You now have two answers on how to solve your companies problem. I consider this matter closed, have a nice day. *Click*  \n  \n&gt; MSP-IT: Was there anything else I can help you with?   \n  \n&gt; Me: No … *Click* \n  \nI spent the next hour or so getting an email together for the four people I had spoken with. In the email I included links to a ton of references on best email practices, specifically countering arguments any of them had made. I suggested that after they had finished reading that if any of them still disagreed with my argument that they should forward me with sources of information they believed proved their case, that there still was a problem and that we need to come up with a solution, also adding in my suggestion. I also included my non-technical supervisor in the email and sent it on it’s way. Not 30 minutes later I was called into a meeting between my supervisor and the CEO, apparently V-Admin had called and complained about me.   \n  \n&gt; Supervisor(Non-Technical): I’ve received a complaint from one of our Vendors. They’re claiming you’re harassing a few of their employees and that although they’ve tried to be helpful, that you’re “refusing to listen to any of their advice” and that they also want me to ensure that you do not have contact with anyone from their IT dept. again. You’ve only been with us a few months and I shouldn’t have to say having a harassment complaint against you from multiple people outside of our company is not… a good sign.   \n  \n&gt; Me: *Are you fucking kidding me* .I don’t know what to say... I apologize that a complaint has been made against me but I can honestly tell you that one shouldn’t have been. I’ve been nothing but polite to them and after figuring out the problem was on their end, I’ve only trying to educate them.   They are creating an issue that is causing us to miss important emails. This has apparently costed us a few missed sales as well. All the information is included in the email that should prove that I’m right. I’m guessing the complaint was made after they got the email, but in that email did you see anything that would suggest I was even slightly rude?   \n  \n&gt; CEO: I’ve read through the email and no I wouldn’t say you were rude in it... You’re basically saying 4 people are wrong, at least two are more experienced and I’d have to assume make much more than you.. that you’re right even though everything worked fine until you made that change a few weeks ago.   \n  \n&gt; Me:  Up until I made the change accounting was getting emails claiming to be from you asking for a wire transfer, or for password, or for credit card numbers. There hasn’t been a single spoofed email that’s gotten through since and that is exactly why it shows that what I changed is working as intended. Their emails are being stopped because they are doing the same thing the spammers are, just in their case the emails are legitimate. Also MSP-IT agreed with me. It was just that his solution to the problem was awful.   \n  \n&gt; CEO: Alright I’ve heard enough for now. I don’t want you making any major changes until you hear back from either me or your supervisor.  A friend of mine is a semi-retired IT consultant. I’m going to see if I can get his opinion on this.   \n  \nA few days later I’m sitting at my desk and they CEO and my Supervisor walk up.   \n  \n&gt; CEO: *Shakes my hand* Well it cost me a lunch but my friend agreed with everything you wrote in your email and to put it simply, he didn’t have kind words for its recipients. He also added that trying to convince V-Admin would be a waste of time and that there was another solution. He’d be happy to work with us if I was willing to pay his consulting rate, but he didn’t think that would be necessary. Think you can come up with a solution without involving V-Admin.   \n  \n&gt; Me: Thanks. I’m sure I can figure something out.   \n  \nSo yea this was one of my inductions in to the IT world. I did come up with a simple solution. Basically any spoofed emails sent from the vendors mail server is allowed to go through if it meets spam and virus requirements.  Also in that situation all subjects are prepended with **Spoofed email** . It’s not ideal but as far as I know it’s still in place and continued to work without issue while I was there.  \n  \nTLDR: When talking to a tiered brick wall brings unexpected consequences.  \n  \nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": "So this post takes places over a few months. \n\nThe very first thing that happened was my bossess bosses bosses boss wanted a full report on what happened and typed up printed in triplicate. This report would also be handed to the FTC. They also wanted a report typed up for the police when they came a knockin. \n\nSo I did the only thing I could think of to do and delegated the parts I could delegate, and then compiled them into nice neat reports with 2 cover sheets. First cover sheet said IRS Investigation at the top. At the bottom it said. \"Rip off this sheet.\" The police were not happy about that. \n\nI was also told to compile all loans deleted out of the system that were stolen by the bad eggs. This also included pulling the backups from the server for the remote wipes of their phones and sending 4 hard drives into a lab for bit shifting the data back. Four users thought that doing the full win 10 reset on their laptops would wipe the data permanently. Two didnt even do the full reset just the one that keeps personal data and reinstalls all programs. The important and exciting parts of the story happened two weeks before the FTC person would come to question us. \n\nThursday of the week in question, the server admins were writing scrips to strip all access to the branch in question. I was working with the accounts team to make sure all emails were being purged and archived. All in all a boring day, but I could not wait for Friday. The day where all of my dreams would come true. \n\nWhat made it all the more sweet was the fact that every loan officer in this branch had shared their AD creds with their underlings and seriously violated security policies to the point of scorched earth. \n\n&gt; $Me = Garek (Because it totally was)  \n&gt; $hit = Head of IT  \n&gt; $HHR = Head of HR  \n&gt; $L = Legal  \n&gt; $BM = Branch Manager  \n&gt; $SU1-3 = Self important Users.  \n\nIt must have been a normal day for them. They were all sitting pretty with the knowledge that everything would be \"sorted out\" this day. Everyone was gathered in the common room of the branch. This one was a repurpose'd house after the town rezoned the area for commercial. It made for a quaint little branch and definitely delivered a hometown feeling. Something told me this feeling would soon be shattered for the occupants inside. \n\nThe doors opened and one by one we filed in to a group of people clearly stunned by size of the entourage coming in the door. There were only two chairs available so some of the underlings stood up and allowed us to sit down. \n\n&gt; $HHR - I want to thank you all for making yourselves available this evening. As you know we have been dealing with a massive breach caused by several LOs in this branch. You have all been unable to work for the last two weeks and have basically been punching the clock, as it were, because we required your presence. What myself and $L are here to inform you of is that this branch is being shuttered. \n\n*She let that sink in for a moment.*\n\n&gt; $HHR - As many of you know, your branch has a very high turnover right for LOAs and this has created animosity amongst former employees. This is made doubly worse by the fact that you share all credentials with your users. When you let people go, you would call the service lines available to you and lie so that IT would reset your passwords back to the same thing.  \n&gt; $Me - As I indicated on the phone with several of you, this does nothing for security. Yes some devices that are logged in will be prompted to log back in, but what you failed to take into consideration was the fact that all the user had to do was simply put your password back in. And I tried to help you. I gave you options on the phone but alas you were unwilling to help yourselves.  \n&gt; $BM - We have signed contrac  \n&gt; $L - You mean these signed contracts? *Slides the exact one the branch manager signed across the table.* I have placed sticky notes on the relevant sections for you for you convenience. \n\nIt took all of five minutes for $BM to read the important bits and to realize he was screwed. He leaned back in his chair and rubs his eyes. The scared and stunned looks on all the underlings faces were palpable. I had to fight hard to surpress a smile. \n\n&gt; $SU1 - Well that just means we will go back to *former company* and work the way we used to before *our company* bought us.  \n&gt; $SU2 - Yeah I have never really been happy with *our company* anyways.  \n&gt; $SU3 - I mean the increase in business was nice, but I can do with more money for me per loan.  \n\nA few concerned looks were exchanged. \n\n&gt; $Hit - Currently we are going to have to ask you to hand over all mobile devices and *our company* provided assets so we can remove our data off of them. All loans you are currently working on are property of *our company* and are forfeit.  \n&gt; $SU1 - That is not fair.  \n&gt; $ME - What is or is not fair here no longer concerns you. I will take the phone here and perform the scrubbing of company data here.  \n&gt; $Hit - I will handle scrubbing company data off of PCs and other devices.  \n&gt; $SU3 - You are not going to get my phone so you can browse through my pictures.  \n&gt; $Me - You may watch me work, or you may lose your data. Those are your only choices.  \n&gt; $BM - I still do not see why we would lose our loans.  \n&gt; $HR - In other circumstances. If one of the LOs were terminated, would you not assign someone to take over their loans? Those loans are property of *Our Company* and as such no longer are yours to work on. In fact those loans were closed weeks ago when this all started. Since the security violation was the fault of this office, you forfeit any compensation as a result.  \n\nThe bickering continued until all phone and devices had been scrubbed. \n\n&gt; $Me - So since you all caused me so much headache over this month, I decided to just say screw it and inform you of this myself. You will not be returning to *old company* as *old company* was purchased by *our company.* In fact, this very building is the property of *our company* ... and since you were all terminated, you have untilt he end of the day to clean out your things. I personally wanted to give you three minutes but I do not make those decisions. (Points to HR) They do.  \n\n$Bm and $SU1 through $SU3 all spoke up and started to bicker with me over it until legal shut them down by showing the contracts. \n\n&gt; $Me - All of you look at me as if I were the bad guy. What you failed to consider here is my job title. Strip away supervisor, team lead, lead,  and analyst what do you get? IT Support. As in I am here to support you. When that phone rings I am your support staff. I am here to support you. I do not want to be here today in the rural Texas suburbs kicking you out of (air quotes) \"your\" building. I want to be at my desk drinking coffee and pretending to work while browsing redding.  \n&gt; $Me - I mean working on legitimate issues. None of them took the time to consider that I am trying to help you. You saw me as \"that annoying guy worried about useless rules,\" and shoo'd me away. If you had listened to me, had worked with me regarding this, we could have handled this crisis without needing to terminate your employement. But instead all of you are here. With that sinking feeling in your stomach's as you stare at my stoic unfeeling face. I do not want to be here today. I want to be at work or at home, not ruining the lives of so many individuals. The rules exist for a reason and you broke them. Now you get to pay the consequences. \n\nAt that moment my fiance grabbed my shoulder. \n\n&gt; $Fiance - You have messed up dreams. \n\nI got up out of bed and went to work feeling unusually chipper as at least some of the events in my dreams would have played that day. Unfortunately those events did not happen. My boss came over to my desk with a big grin on his face. \n\n&gt; $Hit - So you probably dont want to hear this. But we already handled the branch shuffling of that problem branch.  \n\nA skinking feeling happened in my stomach. \n\n&gt; $Me - I literally wrote a speech for this.  \n&gt; $Hit - Do you see why we would not let you go?  \n\nA few months later and I am sitting in some government building wearing a suit and tie as I wait my turn to give what I have to some federal investigator who is very good at his job. Four hours of waiting in a hall being told not to get on my phone and just stare at a wall when I finally walked in. \nI laid the documents which no longer said \"IRS Investigation\" on the desk and the guy looked at me. \n\n&gt; $Gman - Raise your right hand. (Waits) Do you swear under penalty of perjury that the documents.... blah blah  \n&gt; $Me - I do.  \n&gt; $Gman - You may leave.  \n&gt; $Me - (Clearly shocked.) Wha... thats it?  \n&gt; $Gman - Welcome to governement bureaucracy. It sucks.  \n\nI walked out of the door clearly pissed that I had to stick around for 4 more hours in case they needed me for questioning. They didn't. \n\nThe rest of the story is not very exciting. Some poeple faced criminal prosecution, more faced civil action, and the company received several fines from the FTC for its failings. The ceo of the company took full responsibility and received \"small\" penalties himself.\n\nThe end. ",

        "text": "This cross-post comes from a big box electronics retailer that owns a well-known tech support brand, and this all happened several years ago.  During this time period, our company had experimentally merged Customer Service with Tech Support, which generated a lot of interesting, Tales From ``[complicated]`` stories.  This is one such tale.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYours truly was mostly an observer, only participating as a witness after-the-fact.  But I was there to watch the entire thing play out.  So, our cast of characters is as follows:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Dude: the customer/client\n* TS-CS: tech support-customer service guy\n* TSSUP: tech support supervisor\n* ASM: Assistant Store Manager\n* AP: Asset Protection (security) guy\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne sunny day, some Dude came in the store wearing a relevant, heavy, brown overcoat, and was accompanied by his wife and a clutch of about three sons, all elementary school aged.  He brought with him to Customer Service a computer he’d bought at our store.  Apparently he didn’t like Windows 8 and didn't want to go through the hassle of upgrading to Windows 8.1 himself, so he asked for a refund.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe had recently shortened our returns period to 15 days from 30, but TS-CS determined the from the receipt Dude handed him, the computer had been purchased about three months prior.  Dude explained he'd only recently opened the box and wanted a refund.  TS-CS was not authorized to do this, so he called for a supervisor over his headset.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNormally this particular issue would have gone to a Customer Service supervisor, but after about 5 or 6 minutes none had arrived.  So when TSSUP finally finished whatever he was doing in the back, he came out to help.  Dude, annoyed from the wait, interrupted TS-CS’s explanation of the situation to cut to the chase and demand a refund.  This did not go over well with TSSUP, who promptly told the man he was stuck with the computer.  Annoyance turned to simmering anger.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTSSUP then offered to do the upgrade for the going rate, or at no additional charge under Dude’s unlimited service contract, if he had one.  Dude had not signed a contract with us, so TSSUP quoted the prices for the service: $99.99 for the upgrade, plus extra if drivers or software needed updating in order for the computer to work properly afterword.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDude started yelling, demanding to speak to a manager.  Unfortunately, only one manager was on duty that day, and he was busy, so the only person who gave Dude prompt attention (albeit quietly and from a distance) was AP who remained for the time being at the front of the store.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI kind of figured, if it took a good fifteen minutes for ASM to get to the guy, it might calm him down.  Boy was I wrong.  As soon as ASM started to introduce himself, Dude immediately exploded, demanding free service from tech support and calling our entire parent organization a bunch of crooks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, AP, who was a 6′ 2″ (188 cm) bodybuilder type and about as subtle as a flying brick did his best to meander over to where Dude was having his meltdown.  Dude never even noticed him.  He just kept screaming at the manager, flailing his arms about, and slamming his fists on the counter.  By the point, almost everybody in the store had come to watch the spectacle.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo his credit, ASM just let him go until he was done.  That took a good minute, but Dude finally finished up with…\n&gt; “So are you going to fix my ``[censored]`` computer, or what?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; ASM:  “No.  And you need to leave our store.  Now.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWithout missing a beat, screaming…\n\n&gt; Dude: “WELL THEN WHY DON’T I JUST KILL MYSELF?”\n\nAnd with that, he reached into his coat pocket, removed *A SHOTGUN SHELL*, and *SLAMMED IT ON THE COUNTER*, *EXPLOSIVE SIDE DOWN*.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWithout even thinking, ASM and AP both launched themselves over the counter, tackling Dude to the ground, and shouting for someone to call the cops.  AP wrestled the ammunition from the man's hand, as ASM tried to keep the guy on the ground.  TSSUP and TS-CS stepped forward but were waved off by AP.  TSSUP went and called the police, who arrived in just a couple minutes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, the company privacy policy didn’t allow us to find out anything official about how this all shook out in the end.  However, I did hear unofficially the man was sent for a mandatory psychological evaluation.  He never came back.\n\nNote: Edits from TalesFromRetail post rolled into initial version of this post and so not annotated as edits here.

        "text": "I’ve got a quickie today. Unfortunately, this didn’t happen to me, but it’s amusing enough.\n\n**Context**  \nI work for $BigCompany, and the team I’m on supports Point of Sales (POS) devices, more commonly referred to as “registers.” We also support related peripherals (scales, scanners, receipt printers) as well as some reporting websites, the latter to a limited degree.\n\n**The Problem**  \nWe got a ticket in from $BurritoGong, though it didn’t say much. The sentence was a bit choppy, and the details were slim.  \n&gt;”Register not work please help”  \n\nSo, things were looking to be a normal day in the office.\n\nMy coworkers, Dan and Jake, have been working with the end user. Since Dan had her on speaker phone from the beginning, I knew that English wasn’t her first language and that she wasn’t tech literate. Jake was a lot better at simplifying concepts than Dan was (i.e. Jake could actually simplify), and they were trying to figure out why this register was offline. Since we offer only remote support (opposite coasts of the US), and the end user refuses to involve anyone else that might have a better understanding of technology, they’re asking for basic details.\n\n&gt;Does the register say it’s “Online” or “Offline”  \n&gt;Is the register saving sales locally?  \n&gt;Is the Ethernet cord plugged in? What color lights are flashing?\n\nThe last one is the oddball. “There’s only one light,” she says. “It’s red and steady.” This is the point where I stand up and lean over the edge of the cubicle half-wall. We know the networking ports have two lights, and that red isn’t one of them. Dan and Jake are looking at one at that very moment, seeing one light steady and the other blinking. So, they press the end user for more information. This goes back and forth for a while. I lean in, seeing the confusion grow on their faces. Eventually, the idea of her taking a picture is brought up. They send the end user a picture, showing where the network port is, highlighting that area. She’s told: tilt the screen back, look underneath. So, of course she doesn’t send them what they ask for.\n\nIt took several hours for them to get a reply. Finally, Jake’s phone rings, a picture given to him by the End User, showing where all the cords are plugged into: the surge protector.\n\n**Closure**  \nSince some people might wonder what happened next, it took several days to work with the end user to do enough troubleshooting to conclude that individuals at the registers were using them for non-register things, even going so far as to create different profiles for personal use. We were unable to get the desktop locked for non-support purposes remotely, so we had to get new registers, set them up in our office, and then shipped them out to the site to just swap 'em.\n\n-------------\n\nTL;DR: Language and technology proficiencies clash; end user decides to check the surge protector for internet connection.\n\nEdit: Fixed a silly mistake.",

        "text": "I've been working on a support ticket with Cisco on our 5672 switches, which handle 'core routing' functionality on our network. These two switches are set up with HSRP groups on all the relevant vlans and there is a vpc between the switches to allow them to communicate about this traffic and route as needed. IP addresses and details changed to anonymize.   \n\nPlayers:  \n  $core1 - one of the core switches\n  $core2 - the other core switch\n  $tech - the Cisco tech\n\nThe basic issue I noticed a few weeks ago is that pings fail from some of our network to the default gateway. The default gateway address is the HSRP address on the 172 vlan. Narrowing down the issue, pings fail from things which are routing through $core1 but succeed when routing through $core2. Pings are ONLY failing to the gateway address, not anywhere else, so routing is working overall.  \n\nPinging from $core1 to this address also fails. It does not fail from $core2. Looking at the HSRP group, the address is active on $core2 and both switches display HSRP detail properly and that it hadn't changed status for almost 2 years, which seems about right.  Looking at arp resolution and the mac address tables on $core1 show that it isn't resolving the mac address for the address in question. Some relevant outputs:  \n\n    Core1# sh hsrp group 172\n    Vlan172 - Group 172 (HSRP-V1) (IPv4)\n      Local state is Standby, priority 100 (Cfged 100), may preempt\n        Forwarding threshold(for vPC), lower: 1 upper: 100\n      Hellotime 3 sec, holdtime 10 sec\n      Next hello sent in 0.760000 sec(s)\n      Virtual IP address is 172.16.172.1 (Cfged)\n      Active router is 172.16.172.254, priority 100 expires in 5.158000 sec(s) &lt;- address of $core2\n      Standby router is local\n      Authentication text \"xxxxx\"\n      Virtual mac address is 0000.0c07.acac (Default MAC)\n      9 state changes, last state change 4d15h\n      IP redundancy name is hsrp-Vlan172-172 (default)\n\n    interface Vlan172\n      no shutdown\n      no ip redirects\n      ip address 172.16.172.253/24\n      ip proxy-arp\n      no ip arp gratuitous hsrp duplicate\n      hsrp 172\n        preempt\n        ip 172.16.172.1\n\n    Core1# sh ip arp 172.16.172.1\n    \n    IP ARP Table\n    Total number of entries: 1\n    Address         Age       MAC Address     Interface\n    172.16.172.1   00:00:04  INCOMPLETE      Vlan172\n\n\nEach core has a section like this:  \n\n    vpc domain 1\n      peer-switch\n      peer-keepalive destination 169.254.1.2 source 169.254.1.1 &lt;- switched addresses on other core. The 169 addresses are on a separate management interface which links just these two devices.\n      delay restore 150\n      peer-gateway &lt;- this line was missing from $core1, but was on $core2, I'm not sure why I did this on the initial setup, I probably missed it when I did this several years ago\n      ip arp synchronize  \n\n\nThe $tech spent several hours doing packet captures on the cores and looking at arp and mac address tables and looking up cases in their system. The best he could get was that I should do a *shut/no shut* on the 172 vlan interface and it shouldn't affect the network as it's not the active interface, but the standby one. I wanted to wait for a maintenance window to do this, you know, just in case...  \n\nGood thing I did. I added the *peer-gateway* command to the vpc domain 1 on $core1, no effect, no changes. I made sure I was connected to the $core1 switch using a different vlan address (no we don't have a management network setup, go ahead and complain about that but networking is only one of the hats I wear, including vmware, linux, windows, SANs, AWS, and all our application support, I don't have time or a big enough brain to hold it all). As soon as I did a shut on the 172 vlan interface on $core1 I lost access to that switch - you know when this happens because you don't get a carriage return.  \n\n**Bad news**. Oh, and I didn't mention yet, I work remotely, a 6 hour drive to the office, and no one else from the tech team was in the office that night. I could call my junior guy if I need to have him go in but I'd rather not bother him and have to walk him through everything as well. The senior guy was on vacation. Great planning on my part. So much from the assurance from the $tech that nothing would break.   \n\nI looked over at my monitoring software and started seeing red, literally, since down things show up as red. 30, now 35, switches reported as being down. Panic mode starting to set in.  \n\nI tried ssh'ing back in to $core1 on one of the other vlans, I could connect, but it wouldn't accept my credentials! We use Cisco ACS to control access to the switches - $core1 wasn't able to talk to the ACS server so it couldn't validate my credentials.  \n\nAt this point my verbalizations are making my wife worry. I normally do our maintenance window activities on our couch while we are watching whatever on Netflix. She asks, \"Can I do anything to help?\" I don't want to break anything else, like our relationship, so I gather enough wits to tell her somewhat calmly that she can't and that I am not mad at her, but that I broke the network and need to figure out what to do next. I also had to pause Netflix so that the extra noise from the show didn't bother my concentration.  \n\nI sat and thought for a minute or two. I knew I had set up a local 'admin' account on the switch before we had connected it to the ACS system but I wasn't sure if that account was still there, these two years later. I did have config management set up on our switches and routers (RANCID) so I hopped into that and took a look at the *aaa* section of the config on $core1. It looks like my senior admin had added our standard lanadmin users to the config when he added it to ACS! I was just hoping he used the standard password as well. I dug that up and gave it a shot - he had!  \n\nA couple of seconds later I had the vlan interface back up, all the alerts went away, and I could start to breathe again. I let my wife know it was now unbroken and we could start our show again. It took a little while for my adrenaline to subside though.  \n\nWhat I think happened was that any traffic which was routing through $core1 across vlan 172 stopped, even though the HSRP group was in standby. I know about the trick with setting a reload timer when doing dangerous things like this and I thought about using before issuing this command but decided not to do it as I know how long these switches take to reboot and that we do have one link on $core1 which isn't on $core2 due to it being an old fiber run to an off-site location. I would like to plan a core reboot while on site to verify all failovers work as intended though.  \n\nEven though I did this during a maintenance window we have users on site 24x7 working so I knew it was impacting people's work. I'm not sure exactly how long the network was down during this issue as I went into a kind of time dilation that happens during high stress events but I think it was probably less that 5 minutes. I didn't get any support tickets so that made me happy.   \n\nBTW, pings are still not working... I have another call with $tech in the works for further troubleshooting.  \n\ntl;dr: On the advice of a Cisco tech I did a shut on the main vlan interface and locked myself out of the core switch and broke routing for half the network. I was able to get back in by using a local account on the switch to re-enable the interface.  \n\n",

I own my own computer repair business and I volunteer there to help give back to the community that got me where I am.\n\n95% of the people that go just need simple help like their computer needs a clean out or they want help with email on their phone. Then there was this one guy with a dead laptop.\n\nHe slams this old Windows XP laptop on the table in front of me and says \"fix it\", no context or anything. I ask him \"what's wrong with it\" and he says \"won't turn on\". I then look at his power cable and the first thing I see is he pulled out the ground plug. I mention that to him and he says \"don't need it\". I pull out my universal adapter to see what's going on and there was indeed no power, no battery light, no fans, no error codes, nothing. I do the usual pull the RAM and see what happens but of course that didn't fix anything.\n\nWe only have about 15 minutes with each person so I tell him that there must have been a power surge and the power board is fried which happens as computers get older and without a ground plug. He tells me to fix it but I say \"I can't we don't have time for major issues\" and he stomps off. \n\nAbout 2 hours later he comes back as he booked another time slot (to be fair it was a slow-ish day so he wasn't kicking someone out). When he comes back he says \"now you should have time to fix it\". Knowing this wasn't going to end easily (and I felt like proving myself right that it was the board) I decided to open the case and low and behold there was a black spot around a few chips. I show him and say \"this is a major repair on a laptop that isn't even supported anymore\". He says \"well I have you booked so take the chips out and make it work\". I reply with \"this is a free event at a local library, what your asking me to do takes hours and requires special equipment and if I may ask why are you so adamant about saving the laptop?\" My thought was maybe it was a family members but his reply \"it was cheap\", he then storms off.",

        "text": "Okay, okay, you know the drill, LTL, blah blah. So lets get to this..\n\n*Let me set this up for you: For years, about eight or nine I worked for a fairly large school division that prior to cheap projectors and screens being setup in every room we had rolling carts with a fold out screen that teachers could use to present on connected to a laptop. We had a check-in/check-out system similar to a library for the equipment.*\n\n**$Me**: In school tech.\n\n**$MDT**: Masters Degree teacher working on PhD\n\nOne afternoon I had **$MDT** show up in my office to inquire about the projector system attached to the laptop, she planned to use it the next morning in class to show a presentation. Now mind you all teachers prior had received training on how to use the system, set it up with basic punch list of items laminated and attached to the cart.\n\n**$MDT** informs **$Me** that she would need the system all the next day and would like to check it out.\n\nWe go through the check-in process and the conversation goes like this.\n\n&gt; **$Me**  Before I have you take the system, are there any questions you have about usage and setup that I can help with or do you need help in setting it up in the morning. \n\n&gt; **$MDT**  No, I've set this up before and know how it works. \n\n&gt; **$Me**  Great, I am here every day about a hour prior to the day beginning, if you have any issues please let me know.\n\nNext morning come in run through the normal routine, classes begin and it's all going pretty smoothly until I get a frantic call on the phone.\n\n&gt; **$MDT**  Hey, so I setup everything, the laptop turns on but the projector doesn't seem to be working. \n\n&gt; **$Me**  Can you check on the top side of the projector near the power button, let me know if there are any amber, green or red colored lights. \n\n&gt; **$MDT**  No, nothing at all. I pressed the power button and nothing happens. \n\n&gt; **$Me**  Okay, well let me walk down and see what's going on.\n\nSeeing as this is a fairly big campus it takes a few minutes to walk over to the building. When I get there I see the projector cart sitting in the middle of the room where a bunch of desks moved around it for space to setup. I walk over at this point, see the laptop up, press the power button on the projector, re-seat the power cable, you know all the basic trouble shooting. By this point I'm looking around wondering what might of happened, did it die? Then...\n\n&gt; **$Me**  Umm. Where is the power cable for the cart? \n\n&gt; **$MDT**  Power cable? \n\n&gt; **$Me**  Yes, power cable for the cart, where is it, the cart needs to be plugged in. \n\n&gt; **$MDT**  Oh, umm well I didn't know, I opened the laptop and it turned on and throught it was ready to go.\n\nAt this point I'm nearly face palming myself in the middle of the room with about 30+ kids snickering. Look under the cart find the power cable plug it in and I'll be damn it's like IT fairy dust magic with the projector turning on in all it's glorious bright and shiny light beam.\n\nMoral to the story, just because you are working on your PhD doesn't mean you know how to use it.\n\n**TL:dr:** Teacher failed the basic principal of remembering that electronics need power in order to work.\n\nThanks everyone, been at tech support for quite some time and plan to post more adventures as time allows.

Suddenly the internet went down on one side of a bank of desks...\n\n\n$User - $Man my internet has gone down and I cant do any work\n\n$Man- ok can you try google\n\n$User- Nope doesn't work\n\n$Man- ok let me just call IT\n\nAt this point i should explain that we have an on-site facilities manager who deals with IT issues where they can but if not it will get escalated to our outsourced IT provider which can take longer. \n\n$Reeveo- hmm that's strange as my internet is fine so it sounds like a problem just with $User. Is anyone else having the same problem?\n\nFrom the area where $user is sat some have the same but for some it works some of the time. So the problem is intermittent then...\n\n$Reeveo- i tell you what i will take a quick look to see if i can fix it before the facilities manager comes over (i knew they were particularly busy)\n\nI take a look under the desk and see the small 8port switch everyone's computer is plugged into but no lights... So it looks like $User has kicked the cable out but didn't state they had felt this on their feet so I plug the power cable back in and see lots of lovely lights blinking back at me.\n\n$Reeveo- Right you should all have internet now cam you check\n\n$User- yes!\n\n$Man- Reeveo to the rescue! Why don't you sit down and ill make you a brew (while applauding me).\n\nMeanwhile I make a quick call to facilities to let them know I have 'fixed' it. Easiest brew I have had to 'earn'.  \n",

        "text": "So today I was assigned to install a stand up desk for two people. The CTO said IT should take on these tasks, as many have to re-arrange the cables to make sure they are safe when raising and lowering the desks. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/VARIDESK-49900-Height-Adjustable-Standing-Black/dp/B00JI6NCCK) are the desks for anyone interested.\n\nFirst one went great. I moved the monitors back, threw up the new desk on top of her old one, set the monitors on the new addition, and made sure no cables snagged while I raised and lowered her desk. 10 minutes from start to finish. \n\nThe next one was a different setup, but I didn't expect it to take me much longer. She had a Opti 1070 with three monitors. Two were connected via DisplayPort, and one HDMI to DVI for the third. I needed to rerun her cables to make sure we had enough slack.\n\nAfter I unplugged them and rearranged the wires one of the DP monitors was not working. I checked all the connections and power - All Good. Only two are showing up in device manager, so I gave it a restart. Same thing. Then I unplugged the HDMI and restarted it, now one that wasn't working was showing up as \"generic Non-PnP monitor\", while the other one was \"generic PnP Monitor\". Hmm, Update Driver -&gt; PnP Monitor and it comes up!\n\nI plug back in the HDMI and now that wasn't working. I gave it a restart and it put me back where I started- one DP monitor going immediately into power-save mode. After a few minutes of switch around cables, I determined it to be the port, not the cables or monitor.\n\nI turn it off, unplug it and open the box, nothing seems unusual, in fact the two DP ports were in the same connection off of the motherboard. Weird. I plug it back in and wouldn't-you-fucking-know all three monitors came up in the same extended configuration they were originally. \n\nTL;DR: \"Did you try turning it off and on again?\" should always be followed by \"Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in again?\"\n\n",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, this is my first post here and it is going to be a fairly short tale which happened today. I hope i get the formatting right! Feel free to roast me if not, i can take it.  \n\nThis tale's purpose is to brighten your mood by reminding you how easy it can be to fix a customer's problem. Or darken it by having you try to remember the last time you had it this easy.  \nSome details compressed to make the dialogues a bit easier to read.  \n\nThe protagonists:  \n\n**Me** = educated_guess.exe  \nSidejob as freelance IT repair guy, the one you call when you deleted the internet, forgot your email password and/or adress, or need all your data recovered from a dead 15 year old laptop without knowing where they were saved on the HDD, or what exactly you had saved on it.  \nDoing it because its easy for me and funds my weekends.  \n\n**Doc** = customer, some doctor of some sort, idk.  \n\n**DocJR** = Son of the customer, is said to be proficient with computers because he has some unrelated college education. Didn´t meet him.  \n\nThe tale:  \n\nAt work, cellphone rings.  \n\n&gt;Doc: Hello, this is Doc, my computer can't connect to the internet. Can you fix this?  \n\n&gt;Me: Hello, of course. When did it stop working? Are you on a WIFI or are you connected by cable?  \n\n&gt;Doc: I have tried a cable, but i also have WIFI. It hasn't  been working for about a week now. DocJR has also tried to fix it, he know this stuff well because he is in *IT-unrelated college*.  \n\n&gt;Me: *Alarm bells ringing*, also *Sounds like a notebook*  \n&gt;Me: I can come and try to fix it, where are you located?\n\n\n&gt;Doc: In *small town 35 minutes away*\n\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, i have to inform you that i will have to make you pay for the drive there aswell, which is *regular hourly rate* x *time it takes*.\n\n\n&gt;Doc: That's  fine, when do you have time?\n\n\n&gt;Me: Is today at 5:30 PM ok?\n\n\n&gt;Doc: Ok, see you then.\n\n\nI get there, ring the bell and get greeted by a friendly couple. Doc shows me the computer which to my surprise is a fairly new desktop PC with a nice big monitor. Highly unusual in my dealings with private customers.\n\nI inquire about the WIFI he mentioned, he proceeds to show me a power-LAN device two rooms over which is totally unrelated to his problem.\n\nThe search for the ISP modem/router ends in the back of a big drawer in which an old inkjet printer sits, covering up a jungle of different wires all tangled up.\n\nAll lights on the modem are up, but the LAN ports have no visible blinkenlights, but because of the cable salad i can't  get it out of there to look closer anyway. Cant find power button, using **power string^TM** instead.\n\nIt reboots while i check the surroundings.\n\nI find 2 LAN cables going to the PC, only one is plugged in though. Doc says there used to be only one, which is the one that is disconnected. Shouldn't matter, most likely DocJR tried another one, good idea!\n\n\nAfter rebooting the modem i check the settings on the PC\n\n    ipconfig\n\nIt gets an IP adress in a 192.168.x.x local range, but something doesn't  seem right, strange gateway entries.\n\n    ipconfig /renew\n\n**Error?!**\n\nThere´s f#ckery afoot!\nI check the networking page of the windows control panel. It shows a connection to an unnamed network but no internet connection. Tray icon shows me a red X.  \nI switch to the networking adapters page, right click, status, details... a quick glance reveals nothing suspicious. It has a local IP, subnet mask, gateways, no DHCP.  \n\nNO DHCP? Well that's your problem right there!\n\nSomeone seems to have played around with the LAN settings or some conflict between the ISP modem/router and the PowerLAN adapters DHCPs may have cause the stirrup. One of them may also have been the reason for the strange gateway entries. We may never know!\n\nWhat we know is that me being lazy and Windows 7 being the awesome OS it is - it is able to to my job from here. I run the diagnostics tool, it finds the DHCP deactivated and resets the adapter to the default settings.\n/r/savedyou5clicks\n\nInternet undeleted successfully.\n\nAll in all it took me 10 minutes at the customers house to earn one and a half hour of pay on a sunny monday afternoon by fixing his problem with Win7´s built-in diagnostics and repair tool.\n\nTL;DR: Not all mondays are bad.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Writing on mobile, so forgive formatting/spelling errors if they occur.\n\nBackground: I work in a law office while in school for computer science, mostly doing intern type work unrelated to my degree. I also do general tech support where I'm able to, because there's no one on site to do it, and calling for the contracted company is relatively expensive if it's a small issue.\n\nSo, I get an email saying that one of the partners is having trouble previewing and downloading email attachments in Outlook, and asking if I could take a look at his computer to fix it. Charitably, he is not great with computers, so I assume it's something simple. Which is funny in retrospect.\n\nAttempt 1: After checking that yes, this problem does actually exist as described, I do a malware scan with Malwarebytes. Nothing turns up, so I restart Outlook, and when that doesn't fully stop the problem from occuring In restart Windows. Something that probably hasn't happened in a few weeks, so it was a likely cause of the issue. After windows has finished booting up, I open up Outlook again and attempt to reproduce the issue. It doesn't come up with a few different file formats and other tests, downloading the files works, and it looks like everything is fine. I also update his email signature, because that's about the level of computer help he needs.\n\nAttempt 2: A few hours later, I get a second email saying that the problem has come back, and also that the partner is leaving for the day so I would have the rest of the day to fix whatever the issue is. Well, time to get serious about troubleshooting. After reconfirming that the problem does exist as described, I actually read the error message that popped up when I attempted to download an attachment in detail. \"Cannot write to file. Please check folder permissions.\" Or something to that effect. Naturally, I go to the folder where things are downloaded to by default, and check permissions. Nope, the account definitely has write access.\n\nAn Outlook restart later, and a recheck of the permissions, I happen to notice that the C drive is full. Not \"you only have a GB or two left\", but actually 0 bytes available. Well, that's one level deeper to this problem. I go to the downloads folder, clear out a few redundant old files, go to some temp folders and clear out those, and I finally have enough room to install SpaceSniffer to get an overview of where all this disk space is going.\n\nA few cleared out temp folders later, and there are now about 20 GB of free space available. Not a lot, but for word documents and PDF files it should be fine for a while. The computer is probably slated for replacement sometime soon, so as long as it lasts for a little while longer it should be fine.\n\nI'm finishing up, running a full malware scan because I was almost certainly the last person to do so, and about to close out everything when waaaiiiiiiit a minute. The file manager is reporting that this is a 500GB drive. Space Sniffer is saying that it has only scanned ~130 GB including the operating system. That can't be right.\n\nChecking disk manager, there's no fuckery going on with partitions or anything, although I didn't expect that to be the issue. A Google search later, and apparently SpaceSniffer has this button with a ghost icon to display unscanned/unreachable space on the disk. Another search after that, and you can run SpaceSniffer as an admin to allow it to scan that space.\n\nWhen that scan had completed, the problem was pretty clear. A majority of the hard drive was being used for what looked like hundreds of .cab files, which I had never heard of. Some additional searches later, I pull up [this article](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3112358/microsoft-windows/windows-7-log-file-compression-bug-can-fill-up-your-hard-drive.html\n) on what the issue seemed to be. TLDR is that there is some bug in Windows 7/8 where if some service tries to compress a file over 2GB, it chokes on it and doesn't correctly compress the file. Instead it generates a ~100MB temp file. Every half an hour. Continuously. Without deleting the old ones.\n\nWell, it seems like I've found the root of the problem. An enormous deletion later (13,000 files using up 330 GB), and after following the steps in the article, I'm finally, actually done. Certainly been the deepest issue I've faced, and I was honestly surprised that the user was not at fault in any way that I could see.\n\nThe initial restart worked initially, I think, because Windows cleared out some temp folders on shutdown, and those didn't fill back up for a little while. This gave Outlook enough storage to use for previewing files, although I'm not entirely clear on why it needed hard drive space for that. The pagefile file was already reserved.\n\nGoing by the fact that the bug failed on files over 2GB instead of something like the amount of system RAM, I speculate that the bug is caused by someone using a basic signed int instead of a larger, unsigned integer. Can't say for certain though.\n\nThis whole process took about 2 hours, and I left off a few dead ends in this write up. It felt pretty satisfying to fully fix the issue though.",

        "text": "**Context**\n\nI work in a small retailer/warehouse as a programmer and sometimes IT. A few weeks ago I was told that the power button for our shipping computer was being flaky and they wanted me to take a look. The button only sometimes worked and only if you pressed it just right. It looked like a simple hardware issue, so I soldered a pushbutton onto a wire (all spare parts we had lying around) and plugged it into the motherboard. I then ziptied it above the computer. The shipping guy was happy with that solution, and it has been working perfectly for weeks ever since.\n\n**Today**\n\nThe shipping guy told me the electronic scale on that computer wasn't working, and gave me the story why: \n\nFriday night he shut down the computer as usual. Saturday my boss decided he needed to ship something on his own. He apparently didn't know about the new power button (even though he was there when I installed it) and freaked out when the old one didn't work. He ripped the computer out and rushed it to `[random computer repair shop]`. The repair guys fixed the old power button and said it was a software issue. (The button didn't work to turn the computer on, so I find that hard to believe). My boss brought the computer back and randomly plugged everything back in, and surprise! nothing worked.\n\n**More context**\n\nA few months ago the hard drive on this computer died and we had to reinstall windows, which turned into a huge hassle. This computer has two label printers that are the same brand (Zebra) and model number, but are loaded with two different kinds of labels. One printer is used for Fedex, the other for UPS and USPS. When we reinstalled windows we had a lot of problems getting these printers working with the respective software for each of the three shipping carriers.\n\nFirst, only USPS printing worked. We had to reassign printers in the software, and now Fedex would print, but the formatting on the label was very wrong. A long phone call to Fedex support and we got that problem sorted out. Next we tried UPS, no luck. Reinstalled the printer drivers, now it prints but the formatting is wrong. Changed all the relevant settings, still formatted wrong. Long call to UPS support, apparently they have their own drivers for this printer that we must use. Found those drivers, installed them, there is now a \"Copy\" of the printer in the windows printers list, but it works! But now Fedex doesn't work. \n\nMy co-worker $cw handled most of those issues so I'm not exactly sure how he ended up getting both to work, but I believe it involved reinstalling the official drivers for the printer after having installed the UPS drivers, in addition to multiple reboots of the computer and plugging/unplugging them just right. He also had a lot of issues telling the software what size labels we were using, and in the end we had several copies of the printers that you couldn't delete otherwise things broke. You also couldn't rename the correct copies otherwise things broke. That whole ordeal took 2 days to get us back up and running.\n\n**Today**\n\nKnowing how big of a problem these printers can be I was afraid of what I was going to find. $cw is out this week, so I am on my own with this. The scale turned out to be a simple fix. We just had to power cycle it and plug it into a different USB port and it worked fine.\n\nThe printers were of course in the wrong ports. These printers do not tolerate being unplugged and replugged in while windows was running (they create more copies that are set up wrong), so to try a different port we had to shut down the computer each time. 45 minutes of guess and check later we found the right combination that let both printers print. And surprisingly they printed in the correct format! \n\nI'm wondering if my boss even managed to ship whatever he was trying to ship over the weekend, and if so how. This whole problem could have been avoided if he had given me a quick call, or just pressed the working power button. \n\nThe best part? The cut ziptie that used to hold my new power button. Someone clearly knew it was there when they ripped the computer out.\n\nHappy monday everyone.",

Her tone changed immediately, and started asking a few followup questions. it was a quiet day so I took a few minutes to give her a walkthrough of how the internet works, and how CDNs factor in. Aside from her eventually asking how to not use CDNs, it was actually a pretty pleasant discussion by the end.  \n    \n  \ntl;dr One time I thought I broke the internet but it was just a middle aged lady with too much time on her hands ",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, LTL, FTP, you know the drill!\n\nFew years back I was working for large corporation as 1st line agent on internat IT helpdesk. When this story happened, I was working there for about a year, so I was quite comfortable with any calls that could get through. For my brave support I've earned right to work much more often of afternoon shifts- they were quiet, almost uneventful, just few calls from bored users sitting late hours and having their brains slowing down just to basic functions that prevented them from using their PCs correctly. \n\nOn this particular day I was alone in the office, but it was nothing going on, so I was busy with scrolling through memes. Also my mind was occupied with vision of not very large but sufficient sum of money that will appear on my bank account next day. And then a wild phonecall appears!\n\n\n**$Me**- Me, lowly helpdesk agent\n\n**$FD**- nice, but frustrated Financial Director lady\n\n\n&gt; **$ME** \"[standard welcome formula] $Me here, how can I help you\"\n\n&gt; **$FD** \"Hi, I'm [name] and I'm very important financial director. As you probably know, tomorrow is the payday. And I'm the last person in approval chain to confirm bank transfers. And I cannot do this because of card reader not working again!\"\n\nCard readers, our nightmare. To confirm any important operations in our company's bank, they had to put their card into card reader connected via USB to PC, as two factor authentication. And let me tell you, those card readers were shitty. It was the time on Windows 7, and they had last drivers update in early days of Windows XP. They also needed certificate to be installed on PCR to work properly. Certificate which could be found only on card, which of course could be done only if card reader worked. And they worked about 50% of times. \n\n\n&gt; **$ME**  \"No problem, let me just connect remotely and I'll do the basic troubleshooting, we are fixing those issues on regular basis\"\n\n&gt; **$FD** \"Ok, please do, but if this will not be fixed, I'm escalating this to board of directors. \"\n\nEvery week we have the same problem, and nobody can fix this permanently. If you will not fix this, nobody, including you, your manager, me and CEO will get paid tomorrow. \n\n\nSo I dive into her PC, checking everything step by step. Drivers are ok, certificate is ok, device is recognized, but when she inserts the card, nothing happens- bank website is not letting her in. Checked in different browsers, no luck. I'm runnig out of ideas, reinstalled drivers, imported new certificate, nothing works...\n\n&gt; **$FD**  \"I know it's not your fault, but if you do not have anybody that can solve this, you will have to help me somehow\"\n\n\nNow I realize that she is right. I'm alone for about 5 more hours. And for the first time in months I'm afraid that I will not be able to fix something and consequences will be greater than irritated voice in phone. Good thing is that I have 2 monitors, so on second one I search for all previous tickets and emails related to card-readers in hope that I will find any clue that could help me- because every trick I succesfully applied in the past failed me this time. But there were 30+ tickets and I did not had time to read through all of them. I needed time, just few minutes! Let's employ classic trick- $FD was competent, but not tech-saavy. So with ultrahuman speed I open **cmd**,type **ipconfig /all** and close this window after 1 second. They always fall for it.\n\n&gt; **$ME**  \"Ok, with this done, please reboot your PC, and tell me once its back, I'll reconnect and continue configuration\"\n\n&gt; **$FD** \"ok, sure\"\n\n\nClick, remote connections breaks, I have my time! For next 3 minutes I chew through all comments in older tickets, links, mails. But there is nothing there I didn't knew already. And then I hear\n\n\n&gt; **$FD** \"Alright, it restarted and I''m already at bank's webpage\"\n\n&gt; **$ME** \"*internally* oh no, too fast, why so fast?\"\n\n&gt; **$ME** \"ok, I'm connecting\"\n\n\n\nAnd while I connect, I see her at login page, entering credentials. Then its *click* when she drives card into card reader. And it works. Just like that. \n\n\n&gt; **$FD**  \"You did it! Please stay with me for few more minutes, I need to make sure that is works until the end.\"\n\nStill shocked I look at screen where she brings tables of tomorrow's bank transfers (why do some of them earn so much?!), clicks accept, send, uses card reader again without any problem. And it's done. I'll get paid. \n\n&gt; **$FD** \"Thanks and have a good evening!\"\n\n&gt; **$ME** \"Yeah, thanks, bye!\"\n\nFew days later she called again but luckily somebody else had to worry about it. Issue with card readers was never fully resolved or understood.\n\n**TLDR:** I had no idea what to do, needed to buy more time, asked user to reboot and it solved unsolvable problem. \n\nEdit: formatting nightmare",

        "text": "I'm still processing this. Before the weekend I got an email from a user who couldn't log in to the HR portal, these calls are far from unique, loads of people forget their login data and \"Forgot password\" has too many syllables for these people to read so they immediately mail tech support.\n\nI start off by telling her to click the \"Forgot password\" link and follow the instructions. She soon returns another e-mail that the password retrieval option isn't working.  \nUnfortunately this is, once again not that uncommon. The HR system requires you to answer a secret question in order to mail you a new password.  \nSo I reset her password manually and inform her that she's gotten her new password and instructions on how to set her own in her e-mail.\n\nThe weekend passes and this morning I got a new e-mail:\n\n&gt;\"Radijs it's not going well at all. After thursday I can't access the laptops normally anymore. Three have been blocked already. I can't figure this out at all. Please help. Can we arrange to meet somewhere in person on monday.\"\n\nHow this user went from problems with logging in to the HR system to locking herself out of three laptops is way beyond me. I hope to find out more when I next see her.\n\n**Edit:** Well the user called me, and suddenly started talking about how the problem was with her Google account. This still doesn't explain the 'broken' laptops who's screens apparently do not turn on anymore. I've asked her if the batteries could be dead and sent her on to call the people who manage (among other things) the Google accounts.",

        "text": "$Red was notorious for doing things with next to zero documentation, or backups, or even planning. He would just wing it and when it all blew up in his face he'd point at all sorts of unrelated reasons why it should have worked and he couldn't have know and there was no way it could be his fault. On more than one occasion I said to him afterward \"Yeah, but if you'd have taken a screenshot of that\" or \"If only you had written down those addresses. On a piece of paper...\" or \"Maybe you should have backed up the settings first?\"  In one ear, right out the other.  \n\n$ITVP was pretty much the same way, and didn't understand or care that $Red didn't know what he was doing.\n\nThe college had a hodge-podge of Internet providers. This was originally touted by $ITVP as \"connection diversity,\" in that we had three supposedly \"disparate\" providers (IIRC, MCI, Sprint and maybe Paetec or OneCommunications... don't recall) for \"redundancy,\" all providing us T-1s. These connections were all \"concatenated\" by a device I'll call a $HugeTube.\n\nOf course, as anybody would figure out, we didn't really have *any* redundancy, this was just $ITVP's \"marketing strategy\":  Talk circles around people who don't understand IT until they give up and walk away.  In reality, if one data provider crapped out, yeah, we could carry on. But all the connections came off the same pole, into the same data center, thru the same pipe, in to a single device (the $HugeTube), etc. If a truck out on the highway hit the pole carrying the T1s, we'd be DOA no matter how many connections. If the $HugeTube or the traffic management device or the firewall blew up, we had zero redundancy there and we'd be dead as well. Did I mention we hosted our own Exchange servers and Learning Management System in-house, too?  You could be taking online classes, but if our connection went down, you had bupkis from off campus.\n\nOur older $HugeTube device was probably 6 years old and out of warranty, so $Red successfully campaigned for a new $HugeTube in the budget and we got their next-generation device that would support more connections and had a solid state-based OS versus the old one that used an actual hard drive in the appliance.\n\nWe'd had the new, higher capacity all solid-state $HugeTube device about 2 1/2 weeks when one Monday right after lunch it went ***pfff***. Yep, thats the sound it made (well, maybe. It was in the rack in the NOC, AC blowing all over the place and making a racket, so I just imagine thats the sound it made and it died a little digital death)\n\nBoom, the whole campus is Tango Uniform. No Internet at all. Oh, geez, did the dorm denizens light up the Help Desk when that happened: \"Can't get muh porn!\"\n\nI run down to the NOC, and there's $Red, frantically pinging things from his laptop. \n\n&gt;$Red: \"The Internet is down!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No shit, you think?\"\n\nIt took $Red 10 minutes to figure out that the $HugeTube was down. I knew it in 1 minute by the flashing red light on the unit in the rack, but he didn't believe me.\n\nTime to call $HugeTube tech support.\n\nUpon investigation (at the behest of $HugeTube.SupportTech), we opened the lid on the $HugeTube device to make sure nothing was loose inside. Their \"new and improved\" solid state engineering was revealed: a small IDE-to-CF adapter and a 4gb CF card. That was the extent of their \"upgrade\" (well, that and newer software, and a new logo on the box). So thats what we paid another $2K for?\n\nThe $SupportTech quickly determined that the IDE-to-CF adapter was shot. Removing the CF card from the adapter, it was unreadable. The CF card, with our entire config on it, was toast along with the adapter. $SupportTech schedules us for priority support. They're going to dispatch a new IDE-to-CF adapter and a CF card loaded with the OS to us for delivery on Tuesday. OK, we can sort of survive for 24 hrs w/o Internet. Gonna have to, right?\n\nWhile $Red is working with the $SupportTech from $HugeTube, I'm on my laptop trying to figure out how we can restore a least a modicum of connectivity to the campus, especially to our on-premise Exchange servers. \n\nI call the $ITVP and let her know whats what, and she's going to let the senior staff know in the Administration building. We can send internal-only emails, but if you're off campus you're not getting to Outlook Anywhere, and this was before the world of smartphones, so few people had any way to get email on a mobile device anyway. And of course nothing is going in or out of the Exchange server to the internet anyway.\n\nThinking thru how I can help $Red put us in \"limp along\" mode, I wracked my brain for ideas.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$Red, lets bypass this busted-ass $HugeTube and plug one of the T1s into the firewall directly. It will be one third the speed, but at least we can get emails in and out.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"We can't do that!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Why not?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Because the T1s plug into the $HugeTube.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So? They're presenting Ethernet to the device. Whether its plugged into the $HugeTube or into the firewall, it really doesn't matter.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"But we already told the campus we'll be down till tomorrow.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Yeah, but if we make this work, we'll get at least some Internet back, and look like heroes.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: (dismissively waving his hand) \"That won't ever work.\"\n\nI realize that $Red doesn't want to lift a finger to do anything more. He's already called $HugeTube support. What more can he do? Gotta wait for parts.  Maybe even go home early today. \n\nAbout this point in time, $SeniorVP arrives at the NOC. He's new to $MidwestCollege at this point. He'd gotten $ITVP's breathless voice mail telling the senior team that we're down, and he wants to see whats what first hand. \n\n$SeniorVP is tech-savvy and very on the ball. He's got a finely-tuned bullshit detector and he's already figured out $ITVP is utterly out of her depth and he's starting to clue in to $Red's MO. Best thing is, $Red hasn't figured out that $SeniorVP is smarter than your average bear, so he treats him like a $LUser.\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"Whats going on, guys?  Prognosis?\"\n\nI look at $Red. This is his bailiwick. I manage end-user support &amp; the help desk, not the network. Please, sir, explain how we got into this pickle.\n\n$Red looks like a deer in the headlights. This might be fun to watch. \n\nHe launches into this big storied explanation of the Internet connections and our network and the firewall and $HugeTube device. When he gets into this mode, where he touts how high speed his NOC is, he also acts like he's built these things himself from small scraps of tinfoil, spit, ingenuity, and an IQ so high its unmeasurable. And he tries to talk circles around people so they're dumbfounded and go away. Its almost embarrassing when he does this to people with a clue. \n\nFinally $SeniorVP says \n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"OK, but what I really want to know is what you're doing about the problem at hand *now*.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Well, uh, we're, uhhh, we've contacted the support for $HugeTube and, well, they're shipping us a new part to replace the failed part. The $HugeTube doesn't work until then.\"\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"And when will that part arrive?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Tomorrow.\"\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"Morning?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"They didn't say.\"\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"Don't you think that might have been an important bit of information to a whole campus  dead in the water right now?\"\n\n&gt;$Red (turning red) \"Well, I uh, I didn't think.. Uhh, I can call them back..\"\n\nHe starts shuffling papers on his desk looking for the support number so he can call $HugeTube.SupportTech back.  They're on the West Coast, so the chances of us getting some \"more express service\" is still pretty high since its late-morning for them. Lots of time for them to get the parts dispatched to FedEx or UPS for next day early AM delivery.\n\n$SeniorVP waves me out of the office while $Red jumps on the phone. We step outside.\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"What do you think?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I think there is a way $Red can bypass the failed device and put ourselves into a limp-along mode until this part arrives.\"\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: (I can see he's gauging me, too. I don't know $SeniorVP very well yet, but I've been a straight shooter with him every time we talk so hopefully I'm not in his \"bullshitter\" crosshairs) \"Uh huh. What's $Red's take? Can he handle the reconfig or do we need to get someone in the room who can?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I had just brought the idea up to $Red when you showed up, and he didn't seem too keen on the idea.\" \n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"Well, I think you know that being down for 24 hours is going to be a pretty bad thing for the school. Especially now. Anything we can do to get back up, even slowly, would be a step up from being DOA.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, I'll take that as guidance from the administration to do what we can to restore some services as quickly as possible while we're waiting on the parts.\"\n\n$SeniorVP heads back to the admin building, and I go back into the NOC. $Red is just getting off the phone with the $HugeTube people.\n\n&gt;$Red: \"They only ship DHL, and DHL doesn't offer any sort of early morning delivery.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Well, shit, that changes things a little.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"What did $SeniorVP say? Whats his take? You didn't tell him about your hare-brained idea, did you?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$SeniorVP's guidance was 'anything we can do to restore any services or functionality, even partly, would be better than being completely down while we wait for parts'.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"I knew it. Why is he sticking his nose in where it doesn't belong? I know my job!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"He's pretty tech savvy, $Red. I bet $ITVP isn't long for the world. You don't want to get crosswise with that guy.\"\n\nI gave $Red more details on my idea to connect one of the T1 lines to the firewall to get a modicum of connectivity. It would require reconfiguring the WAN port on the firewall to the IP settings for the more reliable of our T1 connections, and it would require some external DNS changes, especially our MX record. Blackboard and our Student Information System would likely stay down because they were going to hog bandwidth, but we'd regain some ability to get to the Internet and email would be flowing again, albeit slowly.  \n\n$Red started to come around to the idea, but his immediate reaction was to jump up and jam a T1 Ethernet connection into the firewall.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$Red, hold on a minute. Lets backup the current running firewall config with all the $HugeTube settings first. And by the way, I'll need the T1's IP info from your $HugeTube documentation.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"I don't have any of that.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"What do you mean?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"I just transferred the settings from the old $HugeTube to this one. I didn't save anything.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So you have no physical documentation of the T1 settings whatsoever?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"No, why would I need that? Its all in the $HugeTube.\"\n\nIt was all I could do not to call the guy a moron to his face.  The problem with his logic was plain on its face, but he couldn't see it. Even with a mirror.\n\nAfter a little digging on the network, I managed to come up with the correct IP info for the T1s (all of them).  I got $Red to login to the firewall and backup the running config *first*. Then we reconfigured the firewall for the T1 connection. I documented the existing DNS before I made any changes there, and while I was at it turned the TTL down even further. We had to tweak on the SMTP connector on the Exchange Server a little, too (and I forced him to document what it was before we made changes) but after about two hours we had mail flowing into the email system.  By now its about 7pm and we've been down for over 6 hrs. We're back on the air, sort of. Barely.\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Holy shit, I had no idea that would work.\"\n\nIt took all my effort not to give him a Yoda answer: \"That..Is why you fail.\"\n\nImmediately I let $ITVP and $SeniorVP know that mail is flowing, the outbound queues are emptying, etc.  Turns out $ITVP wanted to sandbag us to the whole community and NOT tell anybody that anything was even functional at all.\n\nThe next day, we're waiting patiently for DHL to arrive. During the day, I tweaked down the TTL on our external DNS again, moving it from 3 hrs to 1.5, with the eventual goal to get it down to about 15 minutes while we made changes again.  Campus Mail Center tells us DHL doesn't arrive until after lunch, usually. So we're waiting and waiting and waiting with an endless stream of executives and managers visiting the NOC and helpdesk to check on when we'll be up. \"As soon as the parts get here, we'll put them in, restore the config and we should be back up pretty quickly after that.\"\n\nFinally, DHL shows up.  No package. With $SeniorVP, $ITVP and me in his office, $Red calls $HugeTube.SupportTech and puts $SupportTech on speaker.\n\n&gt;$Red: \"The parts didn't show up!\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"Oh, yeah, there was a problem and those parts are shipping out today.\"\n\n&gt;$Me &amp; $Red: (in unison) \"Today?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"What do you mean *today*? You told us this would go out via DHL yesterday!\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"Uh, well the parts didn't get dispatched until after the truck left.\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"What time does your truck leave?\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"Around 5pm local.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So, wait, you're three time zones behind us and you had almost 6 hrs from the time we called you and figured out what we needed to get those parts dispatched and on a truck and you couldn't do it? What kind of a support operation are you people running over there?\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"This happens sometimes.\"\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"Yeah, I'll be sure to tell the staff, faculty and students who are waiting for our Internet systems that 'this happens sometimes'.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So its definitely on the way?\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"Yes, definitely. The parts are dispatched and just waiting for pickup this afternoon and you'll have them tomorrow.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"If they're not here tomorrow, there's going to be hell to pay. I'll want to speak to the head of support there, you understand that, right?\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"Completely...\"\n\n$ITVP shrugs her shoulders and walks out of $Red's office without so much as another word. $SeniorVP looked at me, angling his head in her direction, eyebrow arched. I shrugged my shoulders.  He had her number already, thats for sure.\n\nThe parts did arrive the next day, but then another problem reared its head again: Since $Red had *zero* documentation any of the config work he'd done on the $HugeTube just 2 1/2 weeks ago, we had to do it all over again. Not plug and play like he was thinking. He had just transferred the settings from the old one, configured some new settings (with $HugeTube.TechSupport guiding him) and swapped the thing into production. *He didn't even think to shoot a backup or even write down any notes of what he did*. We had to fire up the old $HugeTube, re-export the settings again, and then he had to go thru the entire process of making all the tweaks and config adjustments to the new unit, but this time with the whole campus breathing down his neck. \n\nMeanwhile I made all the necessary changes to DNS and the Exchange server to revert the 1st day's changes back to our original config. Finally, around 2:30pm on Wednesday, after 2 solid days almost completely dead in the water, we were back up and running the way we were Monday at lunch.\n\n$Red was typically pleased with his performance and wasted no time telling everybody via email how the only reason we were back up was because of his \"Herculean\" efforts. We might have been up even quicker if he'd had documentation of anything he was responsible for.  $SeniorVP, on reading $Red's triumphant announcement to the college community that were \"back on the air\" due to his efforts, called me on the phone. \n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"Is it always like this?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Pretty much. There is a lot of lurching from one emergency to the next, usually exacerbated by a lack of planning and foresight. Especially in the NOC.\"\n\n&gt;$SeniorVP: \"$ITVP is pretty dysfunctional, it seems. And $Red wouldn't last five minutes outside of academia.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Might not even last that.\"\n\ntl;dr: Admin doesn't document anything, assuming it will make him responsible for less.\n\n[EDIT: fixed up my screwed up formatting..]",

        "text": "Hey TFTS! \n\n**TL;DR: At the bottom** Probably worth checking out because the story is just about stupidity and not very climatic.\n\nI work at a helpdesk at a post-secondary educational institute. We support both staff and students (it's surprisingly not all that bad). Staff get full service, students get basic help (mainly just connecting to Wi-Fi, since we don't support the school's website on-site). We do, however, have a hardware repair division that students can hire to fix their computers when they spill coffee on them or can't figure out how to re-install Windows.\n\nSo, on to the good times! I'm ripping through staff-side tickets when I'm approached by a group of girls. Only one spoke, $C1\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Hello! How are you today?\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"Actually, my computer is not working.\"\n\nFor some reason, the Indian foreign exchange students *always* start their interactions with \"actually\". At first I found it rude, but after hearing \"Actually, I'm doing great, how are you?\" a few times I realize it's probably just the language. Still, answering my greeting would've been nice....\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Alright, I can take a look at that for you. What's wrong with it?\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"It won't turn on.\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Hmm, sounds like a hardware issue. We do have a hardware repair departm-\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"Actually it's a software issue. I'm getting a blue-screen error on startup.\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"I see. Would you please take out your computer so I can have a look at it?\"\n\nI ask this because the day before, I'd had a customer who got a \"blue screen\" on startup, which was their BIOS saying \"No HDD Found.\" Don't buy cheap drives...\n\n&gt; $C1: \"Actually this has been happening for 4 days now, it never happened before.\"\n\nYou've had a broken computer for 4 days and are only now looking for help? We're almost into exams, how are you still alive?!?\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Please take out your computer so I can take a look at it.\"\n\n$C1 takes out her laptop, puts it on my counter, turns it on and spins it so I can see the Windows login screen.\n\n&gt; $C1: \"See?\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"This computer looks fine to me, where is the Blue-Screen?\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"You did not see it?\"\n\nWindows doesn't recover from BSODs. Ever. This requires further investigation.\n\n&gt; $Me: \"No, could you recreate it?\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"Did you miss it?\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Yes. Can you please re-create the blue screen, so I can see what's wrong with it?\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"It happens every time I restart my computer!\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Restart your computer and show me the blue-screen.\"\n\nC1 restarts the computer, accompanied with an excessive amount of huffing, eye rolling and sharp glances in my direction. There is definitely no blue-screen, it's also the standard [Dell BIOS screen](https://i.imgur.com/D6rFXT2.png) so no blue.\n\n&gt; $Me: \"It doesn't look like there's anything wrong with your computer, it's starting up just fine.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"No! Did you not see it?\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"No. Your computer does not blue-screen, otherwise it would not make it to the login screen.\n\n&gt; $C1: *(getting very agitated)* \"Yes it does! Right before the login screen!\"\n\nIt clicks. $C1 thinks that the microsecond of blue Windows shows when transitioning from startup-black to the Spotlight Lock Screen image is a \"blue screen\".\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Oh, that! That's nothing to worry about, every computer does that!\"\n\nCase closed, another happy customer! Saved her the ~$100 it'd cost for one of our techs to re-install Windows, to no avail. I love happy endings!\n\nExcept... It's never that easy.\n\n&gt; $C1: \"No they don't!\"\n\n**HALT!** Segmentation Fault. An error has occurred and /u/cuthbertnibbles needs to restart.\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Yes, they do.\"\n\nI'm dumbstruck. Nobody argues with me, especially about computers.\n\n&gt; $C1: \"It's never done that before.\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"I assure you it has. All my computers at home do it\\*, all the desktops here at \\*REDACTED\\* do it. Your computer is fine, trust me.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"No, it's not! I want you to fix it.\"\n\nDoesn't work that way sunshine.\n\n&gt; $Me: \"All we can do is re-install the operating system on your computer, after which it would still do it because that's how Windows works.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"It never used to do this! Please tell me how I can fix my computer.\"\n\nWe, as the front-line helpdesk, have zero obligation to provide any technical support beyond connecting to our college's Wi-Fi. So I have every \"right\" to deflect this to our Hardware Services team. Get them to look at the computer, and have them email her that there's nothing wrong with the machine 2 days later, and let them fight it out over email. But I like our hardware guys, so I keep going.\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Okay, watch closely.\"\n\nI put my computer to sleep, and flip the monitor. We have SSDs in our machines, and most of my gear at home has an SSD. This is where the \\* from earlier came in, this doesn't happen on SSDs because Windows can pull up the Spotlight image fast enough. So now, I'm pretty sure that we're not going to see the image, but I try anyways. I have *a lot* of programs open.\n\nWindows boots and... A flash of blue! Victory! Now get away from my desk, I have coffee that needs drinking.\n\n&gt; $Me: \"See? This is completely normal.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"No it's not. How do I fix this.\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"This will happen every time you boot your computer. It does not need to be fixed because it's not a problem!\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"I don't want it to happen. What can I do to make it not happen?!?\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Buy an SSD.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"How much will that cost.\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Probably around $300.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"I don't want to pay that much! Can't you just fix it for me?\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"No.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"Why not?\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"This isn't a problem so it can't be fixed.\"\n\n&gt; $C1: \"You just don't want to help me!\"\n\n&gt; $Me: \"No I don't. And it's not my job to help you with this. And even if I wanted to, I couldn't, because *you don't have a problem.*\n\nI sit down and go back to my tickets.\n\n$C1 clues in, this isn't something she's getting done. She packs up her laptop and leaves, in silence.\n\n**TL;DR:** Customer thinks her laptop loading Windows is a Blue Screen; refuses to accept that it's loading and tries to argue with me that I'm wrong and should fix her computer.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to clean out some info.",

        "text": "A couple of recent posts (Specifically, the French chain smokers and the Unicorn in the Tower) made me remember this one.  So, gather 'round children, Grandma's gonna tell you a story from the olden days.\n\n*cue swirly effects and time travel music*\n\nThis would have been around the end of the last millennium.  I worked for a company that made a wide range of networking hardware.  My name is DkPhoenix.  I carry a Leatherman.\n\nThe call comes in from the Montreal airport.  They'd had a brief power outage that had brought down the network between buildings, including the tower.  To understand how such a thing could happen, you have to understand what they had done.\n\n*cue ominous music*\n\nThey'd run some cat-5 from the main switch in each building up to the roof, into a 10/100 baseT to 100 FX fiber media converter, which connected to an infrared transmitter/receiver pointed at the next building over.  The whole contraption was housed in a padlocked metal box with holes in either end, bolted to the roof.  It had, somehow, been working fine for a year, until... \n\n*cue dramatic chord*\n\nThe power outage.  All the indoor equipment was on a backup generator (or two) but was the stuff on the roof?  Of course not.\n\nThe problem was auto negotiation, or the lack thereof, between the base T and the FX.  The solution was simple, because the media converter had a toggle on the base T side to hard set it to 100Mbs.  Implementing the solution, however...\n\n*cue James Bond music*\n\nI told the guy what he'd need to do, which was go to each unit and flip the toggle.  He wanted me to stay on the line in case something else was wrong, so I gave him my direct line in case the mobile signal dropped.  Which it did.  He called me back from building two, all out of breath from running.  Apparently, management was blaming him for the outage and on his ass hard to get it back up.  (Which, in hindsight, may have been the main reason he wanted to keep **me** on the line instead of **them**.)  We chatted for about a minute until most of the wheezing abated, and I could no longer hear his heart rate through the phone.  Time for the next one!\n\n*cue running footsteps and obscene caller level heavy breathing*\n\n*cue a THUD followed by a brief banshee screech, followed by a SLAM, followed by colorful epithets in at least two languages*\n\n*cue a scraping sound, followed by the return of the banshee howl*\n\n*cue an \"OH SHIT\" followed by the sound of a mobile phone falling on something hard*\n\nAt this point I an wondering whether to signal a cow orker to call 911, when I hear another door slam, and the screeching sound stopped.  The guy apologized for his language (Shyeah, right.  Like I didn't hear worse from the server guys across the room at the end of every single call.) and said he needed to sit down and catch his breath.  I asked him WTF just happened?  He explained:\n\nMontreal was in the middle of a blizzard, with wind gusts up to 50mph.  It was also about -40 (C or F, doesn't matter at -40) and the roof was iced up.  The wind had knocked him on his ass, and slid him back into the door.  He said something about needing crampons in his tool kit.  I said whatever they were paying him, it wasn't enough.\n\nAfter the call ended, I sat in my comfy office chair and reconsidered complaining about the temperature leak from the adjacent server lab.\n\nPostscript:\n\n*cue mournful bagpipe music*\n\nSomewhere on top of a building at the Montreal airport, there is a plaque dedicated to a legendary fallen IT Warrior.  It reads:\n\n***He Got The Network Running***",

        "text": "Got my first post off the other day and it felt really good to vent, so here's another. \n\nThis story takes part 2 years ago in the same company I am working for now.  At the point in time, I was a basic Level 1 HelpDesk consultant, but was all bright-eyed and eager to learn and carry the ranks. \n\n$Me = Well, me.\n$CW = Co-worker\n$U1/2/3 = Users\n\nIt was a rainy day. We'd just migrated from an old 10.1.0.0/16 (I think that's the correct network range) to a new range at this site. What this meant was we were transitioning end-point PCs to a new DHCP range of 10.129.16.0/24 and that printers, servers and Wireless Access Points would need to be updated. \n\n**$U1**: Hey, I don't know what you guys all did yesterday, but we've got no phones or internet today. When can you get someone out here to fix this?\n\n**$Me**: Hi $U1, I see you're calling from *Wherever you want to call it*. Last night we performed some networking changes which may require you to receive a new DHCP lease. Can you confirm your PC was turned off and on this morning?\n\n**$U1**: Sick of this 'turn on and off' talk. Of course I did. When can someone get onsite?\n\nIt was at this stage I understood that this user was not happy, and has perhaps had some less-than-perfect run-ins with IT before. Being the chirpy, lovable staff member I was, I insisted on helping. \n\n**$Me**: $U1, I am unsure of $CW current schedule, but I'll get in touch and relay this to him as a matter of urgency. In the interim, I'd suggest you perform the following ...\n\nI went through a IPConfig /release, /renew and /flushdns to no avail, and asked that he reboot his PC. \n\n**$Me**: $CW, where are you currently? I have $U1 and his department with no network connectivity today. We've done the basic release and renew. \n\n**$CW**: Oh hey $Me, how are you?\n\nWhenever this sort of talk happened, I knew $CW was either waking up, or not at work/what he should be doing.\n\n**$Me**: You're not at work are you?\n\n**$CW**: Yeah, just down the road getting a big breakfast. I'll go see $U1 in 15 minutes. Leave it up to me. \n\nNow that was less than ideal. Our business has a peak time of 07:00am and if we fall behind then, the entire day is hell. Fine. Fine, I call the user back to relay information.\n\n**$Me**: Hi $U1 this is $Me from IT. $CW will be in the area in the next 20-25 minutes to further operate. I do apologise for the issues faced and we will get them sorted as soon as possible. \n\n&gt; The phones were quiet. Too quiet. It's been 10 minutes, I wonder if it's working.\n\n**$U2**: Hi $Me. $U1 told me of the situation and this is not acceptable. We need someone onsite right now to resolve this. I've got customers waiting. \n\n&gt; I'm sorry, but that is a 3 hour drive from where I'm situated. You got gas money?\n\n**$Me**: I am sorry $U2, but as I told $U1, $CW should be there in 10-15 minutes. There is little more I can do remotely. \n\nAt this point in time, it's worth noting that I can see the onsite router, switches and Wireless access points from across the WAN. We'd set the new DHCP leases the day before and tested, and all was working. We had a OpenBSD box performing a Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow 10.129's to route to 10.1 until we got the printers over and updated the 2 DMS systems integrating. To me it seemed a few things - the NICS had a static, the BSD box wasn't doing it's job, or there was some user error. \n\n**$CW**: Hi $Me, no units here are getting DHCP. Is the DHCP server working?\n\n**$Me**: Hi $CW, yeah dude, no-one else apart from this place has an issue. I can see the DHCP server on the network, with active leases. \n\n**$U3**: $CW hurry up. I'll be reporting this to the $CIO in this weeks meetings!\n\n&gt; Right. Wonder if I'll be indirectly pulled into this?\n\nSo I stop and think about the situation. On the WAN we can see their core infrastructure. DHCP is operating just fine. Clients are unable to get any form of network connectivity.\n\n**$Me**: $CW, if you give them a static IP on the new subnet, does it work? If not, try the old. \n\nStatic on both operate, but there's another issue - there is no access to a few of their redirected servers. That's weird. Wait a minute. Is there a switch we're not aware of here, that is powering this site?\n\n**$Me**: Hey $CW, I had AD1, AB1 and AB2 as network switches here. Do you have additional infrastructure here we're not aware of?\n\n**$CW**: Oh yeah, rather than re-program the switches last night I just threw in new, native ones and carried the items over.\n\n&gt; It's not like there was a script created to pre-program switches, or anything. \n\n**$Me**: Right, so I think we need to first re-visit that. How'd you carry the new VLANS through? We need to make sure that it's configured correctly.\n\n&gt; At this point in time, I had 0% an idea on networking. I knew what I was asking sounded right, but little to what it meant.\n\nTo fast forward the diagnostics a bit, as this took 45 minutes plus, we got the switches online and working fine. Phew. But wait, still no DHCP?\n\n**$U3**: You've set me back over an hour now in work, and customers are leaving in droves. You've got 5 minutes to get this online or I'll be calling CIO.\n\nThat was fine, the CIO and Services Manager were in the office now (since 08:00am) and were abreast of the fault. This is where I interject some more variables:\n\n$NE = Network Engineer\n$SM = Services Manager\n\n**$SM**: Sounds to me as though the configuration on a switch is off. Not being able to carry the correct VLANS to get to the router. What does DHCP as a helper on this site? \n\n**$NE**: OH F***! Their DHCP helper on this site is $Name-Of-Server. It's not been powered back on, or at least it's not on the network. \n\n**$SM**: Why is it not working on the 10.0 network? Isn't that what we're using a BSD box for? \n\nWe're looking over the configuration at the site, and then it dawns on (us) me.\n\n**$ME**: Hey $CW, how many ESXi Boxes do you have on your site? 1 or 2?\n\n**$CW**: Just one, and a physical file-server. Oh wait, two. I have two.\n\n&gt; The reason this site has 2 ESXi servers is another location closed down recently, and we've moved it here to store the data temporarily. \n\n**$Me**: Aaaand, you gave the ESXi host a new, native IP, right? I know we're doing co-ex BSD for NAT Translation, but if that **host** is not online, I don't think we're going to get network connectivity to those virtual servers. \n\n**$CW**: ... I'll go do that now. \n\nThat's how we restored functional networking (without needing static IPs) to the site. \n\nTL;DR - ESXi box responsible for onsite DHCP was never on the network, due to a incorrect IP Address. \n\nThings to note:\n\n* This was early on in my IT Career. When I say some of the terminology now (such as knowing the native IP and NAT) I may not have understood it back then.\n\n* I still am not entirely sure how the BSD works on a high-level technical level, but without the base-host of the ESXi environment being 10.129, there was no network connectivity\n\n* I learned that we rely on FS to do onsite DHCP.\n\nThere may be some wrong terminology here. My explanation of the networking requirements may be off. \n\n",

        "text": "So at the time this happened, I was working for $LT, in legal services technology including transcription of court cases and arbitrations. Usually this involved setting up a stenographer and their 22-key stenography keyboard - you can get USB ones nowadays, but most of the stenographers in court use old models, which are the only thing I've ever used that requires an RS-232 serial cable. That's a whole other story to be told though.\n\nAnyway, $LT had been working on some cloud-based software for taking in-court transcripts and relaying them live to the lawyers via laptop, and the easiest way to trial the latest version without worrying too much about problems occurring was to simply offer it as a free service on top of cases we were already covering.\n\nSo we approach a client's legal team, $CL, who were taking a case at the time, and they're more than happy to try out the service. And on the day, they send $ME - tech support guy - and $CS - a member of client services - to get $CL set up on the system, providing laptops for them to use and everything.\n\n$CS is explaining the features and she gets to the note-taking functionality.\n\n&gt; **$CS**: So at any time, you can highlight the transcript and it'll stop scrolling the page and open a little post-it style window on the screen, so you can write whatever you want right there and send it to your team members.\n\n&gt; **$CL**: That's great. But we don't have more than three people on this job, and one of them will be talking most of the time, so we'll only need the one laptop between the remaining two.\n\n&gt; **$CS**: No problem, but any feedback you have on the system will be valuable, so please poke around and try whatever you like with it.\n\nAnyway, the rest of the day goes past fairly uneventfully. At the end of the day, $CS receives a phone call from $CL.\n\n&gt; **$CL**: We love your transcript product! We think it's got potential to be very good. However, our main issue with it is that we can see our notes after logging out. I guess that's a bug.\n\n?? What? $CS relays this information to the head of development, $DM, just as he's about to leave the office for the day, and he goes into *overdrive crazy mode*, loading up every element and line of code to inspect closely. Asks me to head over to the site, shut down the test system and recover it all back to the office for immediate inspection.\n\nI get to the place. The clients took the liberty of shutting down the laptop et al, and have already long gone. Out of curiosity, I boot up the machine they were working on, and immediately see the issue. Their notes appear before the computer's even finished booting. I call $DM to explain.\n\n$CL wrote their notes on the screen.\n\n*With a pen*.\n\n&gt; **$ME**: You can go home now $DM, clients are just stupid",

Please be gentle, etc. This is not a tale that I experienced myself, but was a tale told around the halls when I was a mere intern working ~~level 1~~ (more like 0.5) support for a fairly large municipality in the early/mid '00s.\n\nMost employees were located in a large building downtown, but to run an entire city there were plenty of small, remote locations involved in operating the day to day infrastructure. One such type of location were the towers where bridge operators, well, operated the bridges. In order to pass the time between ship crossings, one operator procured himself a suite of solitaire games that he installed on his PC in the station. The details of the problem were not recounted to me, but it is not difficult to imagine a low budget **90 GAMES IN ONE!!!** software package causing... issues with whatever specialized software he required. So, some unlucky soul had to go out and climb the tower, remove said software, fix whatever damage it had done, and explain to the user the folly of his ways.\n\nBut this wasn't the end of our woes. Not by a long shot. The user reinstalled the software. **Over**, and **over**, each time requiring a trip to uninstall it, fix it, and yell at him about breaking it **AGAIN**. It wasn't even ignorance on his part of what the issue was, he specifically hid the CD in his office so that we couldn't confiscate it and he could continue installing it. Everyone's nerves were shot about the entire situation, except of course the LUser who just kept enjoying his solitaire at the expense of the sanity of those around him.\n\n*But wait* I hear you asking. *What was that about a Unicorn?*\n\nIt turns out his coworker was as sick of his selfish, stupid antics as we were. But unlike the techs he had a closer eye on what was going on around the office. He eventually was able to suss out where the software was hidden. And he then promptly grabbed it, walked outside, and threw it into the river.",

        "text": "(title was originally the tl;dr. I thought it was too clever for that role)\n\nWhen I first got to $MidwestCollege, $Red had just finished \"flattening\" the college network, making the whole place one big subnet (which he later bragged about to other pros, showing his cluelessness).\n\nI'd been there for about 4 months when $VPIT announced that we'd gotten the funding to implement an endpoint access management and remediation system that they'd been talking about for a few years. Kind of like Cisco's Clean Access. \n\nTo do this, however, we'd have to replace our entire physical layer on the campus because the 9 year old 3Com SuperStacks weren't capable of doing Layer 2 switching or the SNMP control needed to work with the NAC.\n\n$ITVP appointed me to run this project in addition to my usual duties. Great. \n\nImmediately, I knew that I'd have to get a real networking consultant in to help design the new network, do all the configuration and manage the other changes. There was just no way $Red was going to be able to handle even a quarter of this work. He barely knew where all the existing switches *were*, let alone how to configure new gear, things like SNMP, routing, any of the configuration of the various NAC management servers on the VLANs, changes to the addressing schema to accommodate something like 9 new VLANs, etc. $Red was *afraid* of VLANs, so this was way, way over his head. \n\nNever mind that $Red's concept of doing all the changes and hardware replacements would have been whatever method meant the *least* amount of work for him with the most disruptions to the day to day workings of the entire campus. Even more likely, $Red would have gotten half way into the whole project and just started making excuses while the whole project ground to a halt and we'd have to bring in hired guns anyway. Better to just do it right the first time. \n\nWe started our planning with the NAC vendor in January, documenting all of our port mappings, management devices, MAC addresses of college-owned equipment, network printers, wifi devices, etc. Basically, how many ports do we have in each building, what is plugged in to each, and will we need more?  \n\nI took this as an opportunity to correct wiring issues, eliminate random unmanaged switches (not even Layer 2, not going to work for our needs) and potentially clean up our wiring closets in the process. $Red wasn't having any of it since he wasn't \"large and in charge\" in the whole project, and we had to nearly force him to participate in the planning and design process, which I think he thought was beneath his station. $ITVP was no help in this regard, either.\n\nVery quickly, the plan started to come together where starting July 1, when our capital budget was available, we'd buy all the new ProCurve switches, the NAC system and its gear, get the wiring moving, and begin the \"rip and replace\" of the whole network. Until then, it was all planning activities, documentation, training on the NAC, etc.  \n\nThe problem was, July 1 left us at little over a month until we had our students starting to return to campus, and really, because of other summer programs, we about a 2 week window in which to deploy all the switch gear, and then a few weeks to get the configs right, get the NAC working, etc.  It would be tight, but we'd make it work.  We figured out a day-by-day plan of what would get replaced in what building and when based on the summer semester schedules.\n\nAround the end of March, our consultant arrived to begin the new network design. $Walt was a no-bullshit hired gun who cut right to the quick. He was ensconced in $Red's office in the NOC as \"network central.\" 2nd day there, he comes to me. \"$Red is a bit of an idiot, yes?\"  Pretty quickly in $Walt's planning, it was clear we had some hurdles to surmount:\n\nProblem #1: $Red had no ability to access to the huge core switch in the NOC. The previous network admin didn't document the password, so this isn't entirely his fault, really. But he was utterly uninterested in opening that can of worms and potentially taking down the whole network, so for the 5 or so years he'd been there, he just sort of held his breath if he ever had to restart the core. And of course, made not changes, or did nothing to \"manage\" the network.  No way to really get any configs out of that thing. So the core replacement was going to just assume that there were no crazy configs that we didn't know about and if there were, address them when they came up.\n\nProblem #2: Red only had passwords for about 1/3 of the switches at the edge, and while they were all just basically dumb switches at that point, he refused to do anything about them to gain control. Again, like the core switch, he was uninterested in anything that might cause him to do some, I dunno, *work*?  Add to that problem that we were still finding switches on the network that weren't on any of $Red's documentation, so now we were having to add to the number of ports and physical switches in our BOM. Thankfully, this is before we ordered anything,and it only resulted in a \"growth\" of about 5%.\n\nBetween the middle of February and the end of May, I spent a lot of time crawling around in various old campus buildings with my guys, flashlights, notepads and two digital cameras in hand locating ports, figuring out what was wired where, marking patch panels and wall plates, etc. Every switch closet got high-resolution digital photos taken so we could document the wiring and get everything into Visio.  We generated a 3\" thick binder of notes by the time we were done, just of switch configs.\n\n$Walt worked with the NAC vendor to figure out what VLANs we were going to need for their system, and then what VLANs made sense from a college computing standpoint. He built the whole design out in a week or so, encompassing probably 80-90 switches, a new core, about 100 new drops added here and there in buildings to accommodate user patterns and expansion, etc. All told, it was quite a bit of work and I was hoping he &amp; $Red would be actually getting some knowledge transfer in the process.\n\nThe implementation kicked off and it went *mostly* as I expected: Each day, our implementation meeting covered what was done the day before, any outstanding items remaining, what was on the plan for that day, expected issues or problems that needed resolving, etc.  Then we'd go out and do it.\n\n$Walt did a great job of keeping us focused and making sure we had switches to install.  He and $Red were staying just barely ahead of the installation team: unboxing, pre-configuring, marking and staging network gear for installation. Then we'd replace all the switches in a building, light it up on the fiber and let $Walt and $Red do any additional configuration prior to the deployment of the VLANs and the NAC. Plus, they were doing all the core and top-of-rack switch configs and installation work at the same time.    At the end of the day, I'd circle up with $Walt and confirm our plans for the next day so that our morning meeting would go smoothly with no surprises.\n\nFinally, one day near the end of the hardware installations, where we're about to start pushing out VLANs, migrating users and devices in buildings to different subnets and eventually turning on the NAC registration system, $Red storms into my office.\n\n&gt;$Red: \"That sonofabitch!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Who?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"$Walt. That guy is a gigantic asshole.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Huh? What makes you say that?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"I asked him point-blank what he thought of my skills...\"\n\n(now, I'm immediately picturing what went on. $Red, in his usual smug \"please, let me tell you how great I am\" way, probably started to get into his oats a little and thought he'd show $Walt how awesome he really was.  And it went poorly.)\n\n&gt;$Me: (regretting what I'm about to ask) \"Uh, yeah?  And how'd that go?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"He told me I was 'mediocre at best'. That asshole.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (trying to stay diplomatic) \"Well, $Red, you know, you shouldn't ask a question you might not want to hear the answer for...\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"Doesn't fcking matter.  We're paying that asshole a lot of money..\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So let me get this straight: because we're paying him a lot of money, you want him to kiss your ass, sooth you and tell you how great you are?\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"What? No. But you know I've kept this place running for years without any help from the likes of him!\"\n\n$Red gets up in a huff and storms out of my office the way he came in.  \n\nThat evening, after $Red was long gone, I went down to the NOC to find $Walt updating switches and documentation.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So, $Walt, how'd it go today?\"\n\n&gt;$Walt: \"Pretty well. Only a half dozen more switches to rack up and plug in. We might get all those done tomorrow morning, I suppose. I'll have the core routing and switching changes, along with all the VLANs, ready to deploy by the end of the week so everybody in the admin &amp; faculty VLANs will start getting the new addressing schema. Probably make that live on Thursday night or Friday morning so we can run down any problems with printers and stuff not getting the new addresses in those buildings, and then turn our attention to the student VLAN and the registration &amp; remediation processes for them. Sound good?\"\n\nSince this was all pretty much a within a day or two or our original plan, I was completely cool with it.  I was waiting for the big crash in the project and it never came, so it was pretty cool by me.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Fine by me. I'll get the emails for the campus community tee'd up and ready to fly letting them know whats coming in the next couple days.  Hey, did $Red ask you about his skillset today?\"\n\n&gt;$Walt: (rolling his eyes) \"Oh, yeah.. hahaha. We were sitting here and he said 'Come on, $Walt, whats your honest opinion of my skills? This place wouldn't keep running unless it was for me, right?'.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (smiling) \"And let me guess, you said something like 'I'm surprised the whole place is *still* running at all with you at the helm,' and then followed it up with 'Your skills are mediocre at best'. Amiright?\"\n\n&gt;$Walt: \"Obviously, he didn't actually go to the bathroom when he got up all red-faced  and said he had to take a piss, huh?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Nope. Keep it up. You might not know it, but you're doing God's work down here.\"\n\ntl;dr Don't ask the question when you don't want to hear the answer.",

        "text": "A family member has a MacBook and asked me for some help recently. He was having issues connecting it to the WiFi router in his room.\n\nI just recently got a MacBook, myself, but I wasn’t too knowledgeable about how to troubleshoot various things on a Mac but I was game to try.\n\nI first checked out the router. Rebooted it, checked the connections, checked the indicator lights and all that jazz.\n\nI tried to connect and it wasn’t connecting just as he said. The WiFi symbol was making a continuous symbol as if it were in the process of connecting but it never went solid to indicate it had successfully connected to the network so I knew something was going on, maybe software related?\n\nObvious first thing was to reboot. After the reboot, the issue was still there.\n\nI did a bit of Googling and found some solutions. I tried each of them and had no luck. I figured that maybe it was the network as he said. But there was a woman with us with a MacBook almost identical to his, my iPhone, his iPhone, her iPhone, and my gaming laptop. *All* of these devices connected to the network successfully and we could all access the web.\n\nConvinced that there could potentially still be an issue with the router and not his MacBook, I tried to get his MacBook to connect to my iPhone’s hotspot.\n\nSame issue. I confirmed that all the other devices could connect to my hotspot and yeah, they could, so it wasn’t an issue with my iPhone’s hotspot.\n\nThere was a second WiFi signal nearby that I tried to connect to. All of the other devices connected to it successfully but not his MacBook.\n\nHis friend had a dongle for an Ethernet adapter and I connected it using a spare Ethernet cable I had and was able to get his MacBook online! But only through the Ethernet cable. I checked for any updates hoping that maybe the issue lied there? Nope. The MacBook was up to date. I unplugged the dongle and gave it back to his friend.\n\nAt this point, I was almost positive that it was an issue with his MacBook, maybe even hardware related. But I still wasn’t sure and so I told him.\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah...I’m 99% sure that this issue is with your MacBook and not the router. I got EVERY other internet capable device in this room to connect to that router and they all can but not your MacBook. Your laptop also won’t connect to my iPhone’s hotspot or the other WiFi signal nearby. I recommend scheduling a Genius Bar appointment because it could be the WiFi card but I honestly don’t know enough about Macs to say for certain. \n\n&gt;Family Member (FM): Are you sure? I’m so sure it’s got to be that router because I can get it to connect to Starbucks hotspots and the WiFi at home.\n\n&gt;Me: Well maybe the issue just occurred? Computers can begin having problems later.\n\n&gt;FM: Nah, it’s that router. I’m going to have it replaced.\n\n&gt;Me: That’s going to be a waste of money and a perfectly good router but okay.",
