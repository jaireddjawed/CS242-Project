My plan was always to go into research and academics, I loved the theoretical and math side of CS. But by the end of my bachelors I became jaded and burntout, and decided the best career path for me would be to teach high school. So fast forward to today and I have spent the last nine years teaching high school math. \n\nThe present: I have decided to move on from teaching high school for a variety of reasons, and would very much like to get back into CS Academics and am looking to pursue a PhD in order to do so. My question is: what sort of impediments am I going to encounter being in a high school setting for the last 9 years? Having been gone for so long, do I have a chance of getting into a program at all? And finally, if so, what sort of things could I do while finishing teaching high school to help my chances? \n\nAll advice and recommendations are greatly appreciated!",

Does a an object like an integer have a pointer to it's value or is that part of the object itself? I don't quite know enough to ask proper questions, so I would just prefer a comprehensive explanation. I realize that this may be too general so I'll also accept sources that discuss this sort of thing. The sources I've looked at have been incredibly vague, and I'm not sure how to phrase my search (\"cpython object composition\" means some else entirely of course).",

        "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI'm about to start a Computer Science (CS) major. I minored in IT. While we had some calculus and linear algebra in our IT minor, we didn't have as much math as CS minors. Therefore, I decided that alongside my CS major I will review and learn the math I missed in order to contribute to the *Artificial general intelligence safety field*.\n\nBelow are some links to papers published in the field of artificial general intelligence safety:\n\n - [Functional Decision Theory: A New Theory of Instrumental Rationality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf)\n - [Corrigibility](https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf)\n - [How We're Predicting AI - or Failing To](https://intelligence.org/files/PredictingAI.pdf)\n\nThere is also a recommended reading published by one of the organizations which deals with the issue [here](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/).\n\n**What my goal is:** To learn the prerequisite math, so that I can read and understand the state-of-the-art papers published in this field.\n\n**My problem:** Lack of understanding of what I need to learn and how to sequence it\n\nSo if someone can help me construct a plan to learn this (with topics and preferably books), that would be amazing. For example, I highly doubt that reading \"baby Rudin\" would be the best use of my time.\n\nSo I thought of doing this in this order:\n\n - Precalculus (already reviewed it, my main book was *Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell*; should I also read *Basic Mathematics* by *Lang* ?)\n - Calculus (reviewing it currently; the main resource is the book in my local language and *Calculus* by *Stewart*; should I read *Spivak*?)\n - Linear algebra (will review it from my local language book; should I read *Linear Algebra Done Wrong*?)\n - Discrete mathematics (will have it as a course on my computer science major)\n\n**Again, my main problem is not knowing \"how deep I should go\".** Of course that for precalculus I could read *Lang* (I actually read about one third of *Basic Mathematics*), but is it really the best use of my time?\n\nI hope you see my point. Tell me:\n\n1) *How can I best approach learning this material?* As a part of that, *what material should I learn* and *in what order?*\n\n2) *How much minimum time per day should I invest in learning this?* Remember, I'm learning this on my own as sort of a hobby and when I ask for a minimum time per day, I really mean minimum - meaning I had a family emergency, my apartment got swallowed in a fire and I'm sleeping on a street naked, but yet I do that minimum daily habit. I put my \"ceiling\" at 2 hours a day, not to overdo it.\n\n3) *How much time do you see this taking?* (dumb question I know, but I see this as a big unsurmountable obstacle, so someone telling me \"It will take 1 or 2 years\" or something similar is going to give me guidance).\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "I'm a seinor a small liberal arts college. Some friends and I formed a computer club. It took over a year of pushing paperwork around, playing politics and running from office to office getting signatures and approvals. This summer we were finally were able to secure a room  on campus that we could use for a hackerspace / makerspace. I guess,for many if us, this is our last year. Therefore, an opportunity to leave something cool behind for future computer enthusiastis.\n\n We found some 3D printers in a closet that needed repair, a box full of Arduino/Raspberry Pi stuff from 2014, and managed to save some Dell Optiplex 7010 s from Surplus. We sourced some furniture from on campus, programmed some led strips under the tables and set ourselves up a cool little spot. We came.up with some guideline posters for the space, a raspi with screenly on it that shows some cool web apps and animations people worked on, and some people are working on a mural idea. While we are putting all this together I'm curious...\n\nIf you were in my shoes, how would you decorate your makerspace?\n\nPeople have been bringing in cool things to work on and play with even before we officially \"open\" in the fall. Somebody donated a pfsense box and a wifi pineapple. Most of the books on our bookshelf are from my house. We are trying to come up with a plan to source a budget. I'm looking up computer science grants, and some other folks are looking into the successful alumni route. I was thinking of writing a bot fir Craigslist type sites that would help me ask people who are selling computer equipment to consider donating it to us instead. There is interest to rebuild/repair/refurbish computers for underserved communities. Some of those in need being our fellow students. (Nothing sadder than a CS student who  cant afford a comouter) So I, guess the second question is: \n\nWe have a space, unlimited power, unlimited internet, and absolutely minimal budget. How can we identify the needs of and best serve our community? (online and otherwise) Any ideas on sourcing the equipment required to be effective?\n\nLastly, we host classes and lectures during the day cause it is a college but at night we play ctf and wanted to host some kind of event/theme things. Like Trekkie Tuesday 5-9 (We lower the lights, come in and study with us while we binge watch startrek on the school's Amazon account) or Scifi Friday (we watch a scifi film then discuss the realism/science behind the tech) Modern Binary Mondays (Learn Reverse Engineering) We want to host some attack and defend games but the people with the skills to build the lab keep graduating or get jobs that take up all thier time. \n\nAre there any nerdy/CS type events you wish your college hosted?\n\nThings that are in the works:\n\nA website\nPartnership with the local makerspace (we kind if have different needs and clients but they provide guidance)\nLive Streams (twitch money?)\nReaching out to the physics department to lend us some legitimate science cred.\nA take a book leave a book thing (mostly just threw my bookshelf in the corner. Would love to give away good Scifi/comp sci books if we could get them. Turned a high school kid onto Snow Crash the other day and it made my week)\n\nWe toured some other makerspaces in the state and got some great advice. So I open this up to you internet. What would you do in my shoes?\n",

Finding decent-paying, consistent employment in wildlife is getting so overly competitive that PhD's are applying to $12 an hour tech jobs. A 6-month unsuccessful job search was my breaking point. I have realized that staying in the field would be long-term financial suicide. I have always been the \"tech guy\" in my jobs and half of wildlife science is really just data analysis. I recently got lucky and was offered a full-time job in IT, which will give me time and stability to further my education. I would really like to start school next year to get a Masters in Computer Science. My main question is this - Since I did not study CS as an undergraduate, what should I independently study/learn to best prepare me for an M.S. degree in CS? I have already started studying information theory, basic mathematics for CS, and beginner programming in Python. (As a note, I know my weak point is mathematics - I get it, but it just takes me longer than normal to understand it). Do you have any suggestions on links/courses/books/videos etc. to help best prepare me and give me a solid foundation? I know transitioning to a CS Masters will be difficult, but I am willing to put in the work, and I just need informed direction on where to start. TIA for your advice.  ",

        "text": "Suppose I wanted to create a datatype that treats all letters as their integer equivalent (ascii/decimal), and stores each individual letter as a series of 3 digit integers with leading 0s that are visible. Is this possible, and what would I need to look into to make this happen?\n\nConsider the following example for why I would want to do this. I bump two letters together \"AA\". We all know this to be two unique letters, but suppose I bump two equivalent numbers together  6565(int) we don't know if this is two numbers or four numbers 6, 5, 6, 5 or some other combination without establishing static rules to interpret number concatenation. If I put a break character in between, I gain uniqueness (103-65-65 is not ambiguous),but I lose the mathematical utility of having true integers. Also I want to avoid the overhead of hashing, so that's not an option.\n\nUltimately, I'm looking for numerical comparison and mathematical operations, with character concatenation and uniqueness properties.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated.\n\nEdit: hopefully this will help explain my motives a little better.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n    a = \"leak\"\n    b = \"leak\"\n    c = \"leaking\"\n    \n    //separated by commas for reading, but treat as integers\n    //my proposal\n    i = 108,101,097,107\n    j = 108,101,097,107\n    k = 108,101,097,107,105,110,103\n    \n    //current ascii interpretation\n    x = 108,101,97,107\n    y = 108,101,97,107\n    z = 108,101,97,107,105,110,103\n\nconsider the following operations:\n\n    // evaluates to True; O(n) complexity; character by character comparison; n = string length\n    a == b \n    \n    // evaluates to False; O(m) complexity; character by character comparison; m = min string length\n    a == c\n    \n    // evaluates to True; O(m) complexity; character by character comparison; m = min string length\n    a LIKE c \n    \n    //evaluates to True; O(1) complexity; integer comparison\n    i == j\n    \n    //evaluates to False;O(1) complexity; integer comparison\n    i == k\n    \n    //evaluates to True; O(1) complexity; new integer function min_char_len(i,k) = 4; k_temp = i &lt;&lt; 4 = 108,101,097,107 or shift to first 4 triplets in plain english;\n    i LIKE k\n\nIt's easier to speak to the x,y,z case since I don't have an example off hand. Essentially the reason the leading 0 is needed, is because there is the potential for edge cases where a combination of characters of different decimal lengths can make ambiguous numbers for instance looking at ascii characters.\n\n\"SOH\" == character(1)\n\n\",\" == character(44)\n\nd = character(144)\n\nIf you convert characters to decimals without leading 0s\n\n    character(1) + character(44) == character(144)\n\nwith leading 0s,\n\n    character(001) + character(044) != character(144)\n\nFurthermore, doing any sort of string conversion for the sake of formatting is not my intention, and does not lead to the speed increase that I mention above.\n\nA human looks at the word \"leak\" and sees a symbol consisting of characters all consumed at once, current computers look at the word leak and see a sequence of fundamental symbols to be evaluated one at a time.\n\nMy proposal is that it does not have to be this way, and I'm interested in having large symbolic data structures.\n\nOne obvious limitation of this is that max\\_int for 64 bits is 1.8x10\\^19 which leads to words that can be no longer than 6 characters (floor\\[19/3\\]) long, but I have some ideas to get around this. I'm also looking into 128 bit integers.\n\nThe leading 0 is what's really boggling my mind. Essentially I want integers that can encompass this 3 digit decimal representation of characters without doing some messy extended conversions, and I also want to be able to join those entities together into unique higher order symbols let's call them while maintaining the versatility of true integers. Hashing would be another way to get letters to numbers, but then again I have the problem of ambiguity when concatenating hashes, and there's also the problem of overhead of actually doing the hash.\n\nFinal Edit:\n\nI appreciate the constructive feedback folks.  I think I may have to look more deeply into information theory. Even though my question was pretty specific, I think the main curiosity I have lies there. A few of you gave me some other interesting rabbit holes to go down as well.",

This figure is then sent to our team with information about the property. We then have to collect information that identifies the property such as it's location on the UK Land Registry, an overhead snapshot on Google maps and a picture of the property on Google street view. We then check that the property meets correct criteria and if it does, we send the report back to the lender and have essentially given a mortgage to the applicant. \n\nTo mitigate errors, the team (6 people), work from a shared excel workbook, where we input all the jobs we carry out, so that another person can check our work and essentially get another pair of eyes just to look over the job that's been carried out to make sure there aren't any obvious errors. Each person has 3 sheets in the workbook which is for the 3 different job types we carry out. Every hour, we go into each others sheets and check each of the jobs in there and input our name at the end of each job to let the other person know that it has had another pair of eyes look it over and that the job is now ready to be signed off and sent back to the lender. \n\nCurrently the issues we are having are that to see any updated entries we're constantly saving the workbook and once each person has put on a few jobs, the workbook starts to slow down. We've had to begin archiving the workbook every week and then deleting everything off it and starting from fresh due to how slow it becomes. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on how we could streamline this procedure, or at least move away from Excel? I don't dislike excel I just feel that there must be a more efficient solution to this procedure. \n\nI can provide more details of the procedure and the current structure of the workbook if anyone has any ideas.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!

Specifically, will it improve my earnings potential, job stability, and employability as a game developer?  \n\n\nSome background info: I'm a CompSci student who wants a career in game development, specifically as a gameplay programmer or rendering engineer. Long term I see myself growing into a senior position at a major studio in one of these roles, and still doing hands-on programming work. Alternatively, I'd also like to start my own indie studio, or to work as a freelancer or a consultant within the games industry.  \n\n\nI'm currently near the end of a BSc in Computer Science, and I also have experience in the game industry both from before I started studying computer science, and from work placements while I've been studying.  \n\n\nI have a &gt;4 GPA at a top Canadian university and I qualify for an accelerated masters degree program, which would mean I could shave about 3 classes off the 10 classes required for a masters degree (or 5 classes + thesis). At my school, MSc students also receive financial assistance of about \\~20k for TA and/or RA work while they're writing their thesis, which is pretty nice.  \n\n\nIn addition to the accelerated masters program, I also have some promising leads for a co-op work placement at a major AAA game studio I have previously worked at. The role sounds right up my alley, I have been guaranteed an interview with them and have some good relationships there. I feel that if land the job and complete the co-op placement with them I'll be offered a full-time job once I'm done my bachelor's degree, and I worry that I wouldn't want to turn it down to return to school. The co-op is a paid position, and the full-time job would come with great benefits etc, and would be in a junior role that would lead me down the path of reaching my career goals.  \n\n\nMy dilemma is this: I'm a mature student, and I'm eager to be done with school and return to the work force. I'm also eager to make the most of my education while I have the chance. I am absolutely certain that I want a career as a programmer in the games industry, I'm just not sure which path to take: Do my masters degree, or leave with a BSc if I'm offered a job.  \n\n\nI expect a master's degree will increase my earnings potential, employability, and stability, but I'm not sure by how much? These are the most important factors for me (as I already know I love this line of work), but I'm not sure if earning a master's degree will significantly improve my career outcome, or where the break-even point between starting work now or after another 2+ years of school to get a higher degree. I enjoy school, but I also can't wait to be done and start my career.  \n\n\nI'd appreciate any input or advice. If you have a master's degree in computer science, how has it helped you compared to your colleagues with bachelor's degrees? If you have a bachelor's degree, have you faced any career obstacles? Is industry experience or academia valued more in the game industry? Will I earn more or have any other advantages with a master's degree?",

In general, if I have two deterministic programs A and B, will T(A)/T(B) (where T(A) is the mean amount of time it takes to execute A) be consistent between different machines and is this a question that it even makes sense to ask?

I ended up with a 3.0 in the class but as I said, only due to the fact that I got a ton of help. I feel like I'm not good at programming, and when I can't figure something out  (which happens to be most of the time) I get frustrated and it makes me miserable. The few times that I actually knew what I was doing were the only times where I enjoyed doing it.\n\nI guess my question is, do you think it's worth it majoring in computer science if I dislike programming? I feel like even though I'm bad at it now, if I keep practicing I can (hopefully) get better, so right now I'm focusing on whether I like it and can have a lifelong career in it or not.\n\nI gravitate to both creative, artistic things and analytical and problem-solving things at the same time, so I was thinking in maybe majoring in something called Media and Information which focuses on social media management, IT, animation, video games, and film. And then minoring in computer science.\n\nI don't know, do you guys have any advice? I don't want to major in MI and then realize after I graduate that I made a mistake, because I know how valuable education in CS is right now, and I've always loved the idea of doing CS.

All of these questions are from Ben-Ari's \"Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming\".\n\nMy question deals with the Ricart-Agrawala's deferred lists.\n\nDefine n as the number of nodes in a connected network.\n\n**1. How many entries can one deferred list hold at most?**\n\n**n-1** at most (all who requested entry into their critical section, besides one who is allowed entry)\n\n**2. How many entries can all deferred lists hold at most?**\n\n**(n-1)n** (all request entry into their CS, one is allowed and this list is shared under all the n-number of nodes)\n\n**3. Can the deferred lists of all nodes be empty?**\n\nNo - only if by some freak occurence nobody requests entry into his CS, which would seem like a useless scenario for the whole topic.\n\n**4. If permission to enter the CS would be given from the currently \"allowed to work in his CS\" node n1 to another node n2, BEFORE n1 has entered his CS, would the algorithm still work?**\n\nI suspect not, because the property of mutual exclusion between nodes is not given anymore. Both could happen to work simultaneously on their CS, without anything *(for example primitives, which are only built inside the nodes themselves)* stopping them from being in there at the same time.\n\nThanks for any help in advance.",

Getting the first three lines have been relatively easy but the last one has left me stumped. The bottom connecting line which connects the outside lines. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this at all.\n\nHere is what I have so far\n\n    //Main Line\n    \n    line(mouseX, mouseY, mouseX + 50, mouseY + 120);\n    \n    //Left Line\n    \n    line(mouseX, mouseY, mouseX + 0, mouseY + 45);\n    \n    //Right Line\n    \n    line(mouseX, mouseY, mouseX + 40, mouseY + 20);\n\nWhatever I do for the bottom line, I either get some random line which is the wrong angle and starts at the tip of the triangle or I get a line that is stationary somewhere and it follows the cursor, but when I move the cursor the line just stretches. I know it's likely a simple fix but I've been trying to scan the p5.js websites references and haven't been able to find anything :c\n\nExcuse me for my really beginner question haha.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo I finally got the line to meet on both edges and create a bottom of the triangle, but I am not entirely sure how to get the bottom to move with the rest of it though. I just keep trying different variations of things but nothing is really working for me.\n\nThis is what I have so far and I left all the mouseX, and mouseY since I am not sure what to do there with this specific line\n\n    function setup () {\n      createCanvas(400, 400);\n    }\n    function draw () {\n      background(200); \n      //Main Line\n      stroke\n      (255, 0, 0);  \n      line(mouseX, mouseY, mouseX + 50, mouseY + 120); \n      //Left Line\n      stroke(70,05,106);\n      line(mouseX, mouseY, mouseX + 0, mouseY + 45);\n      //Right Line\n      stroke(0,0,255);\n      line(mouseX, mouseY, mouseX + 40, mouseY + 20);\n      //Connecting Bottom Line\n      line(40, 20, 0, 45); *** The one I'm stuck on ***",
