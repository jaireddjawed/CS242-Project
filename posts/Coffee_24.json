I’ll tell you what I’m doing, and maybe you guys can help me dial in this coffee correctly.\n\nCurrently, I’m using Hoffman’s new one-cup V60 method which is 15g/250g @ 205° water (I’m using 02 Hario tabbed filters). Currently, my Fellow Ode is set to one notch above 2. In the past, I’ve ground this coffee all the way from 2 notches above 1 all the way to 2 notches above 3. In other words, I’ve gone from essentially medium-fine/fine to medium-coarse. In all of my cups, especially on the finer grind sizes, the coffee seems very muddled, and on the coarser grind sizes, the coffee seems very sour. This coffee drains extremely quickly, btw.\n\nWhat do you think I could do? Should I increase my dose to 20g? Should I do something else? I’ve reached out to Onyx, but they aren’t any help.",

I usually use a Moka pot to make myself a full cup (~12oz) of coffee, sometimes twice a day, and prefer medium to dark roasts.\n\nI've got the money to spend on it, but I'm worried I'm jumping right into the high end version.",

If you're freezing beans, do quality, processing, level of roast play into whether they will stay at good quality? My comparison would be wine where high alcohol, high acidity, high complexity all tend to lead to a more expensive wine, but one that holds up better to ageing. Is there a similar rule for coffee?",

People assume \"dark\" means a bolder flavor and more caffeine, when the exact opposite is true. \n\nWouldn't this be solved if we categorized the type of roast as \"rare, medium, and well done,\" similar to how we describe how long a piece of meat has been cooked? Then people would know that \"dark\" doesn't mean more concentrated or more bold or whatever, it just means it's burnt!",

I've been going much finer and getting tasty brews (which is the goal) so I'm not really complaining, just curious what their thinking is.",

That said, I still don't really like it due to the bitterness and smokiness(?), which are both things that I'd like to avoid in my coffee.\n\nSince I don't have experience with other coffees before, I don't know what I like aside from not wanting a roast that's past medium. I want to get a sampler pack that's a mix of light and medium roast coffees so that I can pin down what type of coffee I like (if any), but I haven't been able to find any options that satisfy me. The main two I've considered are S&amp;W Craft Roasting's sampler pack, which is okay but not one I love since they only have one medium roast and almost every one of their light roasts is made out to be floral/fruity to the point where I'm worried it won't really feel like coffee, and onyx coffee labs, which is okay but doesn't give any control on the roasts you get and is priced at $30 (compared to the ~$15 of S&amp;W). \n\nAre there any sampler boxes that give a good selection of options between light and medium roast whole-bean coffees (bonus points for being under the $30 mark)?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Specialty-Coffee/comments/10rjfnt/the_rise_of_specialty_coffee_and_its_impact_on/",
        "text": " \n\nThe world of coffee has undergone a major transformation in recent years, with [specialty coffee](https://specialtybatch.com/) leading the way. No longer is coffee just a simple pick-me-up in the morning, but it has become a luxury experience in its own right. In this article, we’ll examine the rise of specialty coffee and its impact on the coffee industry.\n\nSpecialty coffee refers to coffee that is made from high-quality, carefully selected beans and is often considered the finest coffee in the world. It is grown in specific regions with unique climates and soils, and is often hand-picked and processed to ensure the highest quality beans. The result is a coffee that is rich in flavor and aroma, and is considered to be a luxury product.\n\nThe rise of specialty coffee has been driven by a number of factors, including a growing appreciation for high-quality coffee and a desire for unique and interesting coffee experiences. Consumers are now more informed about coffee, and are willing to pay more for a premium product. The trend has been further fueled by the growth of coffee shops, which offer a wider range of coffee drinks and allow customers to experience specialty coffee in a relaxed and social environment.\n\n[Speciality coffee](https://specialtybatch.com/) has also had a significant impact on the coffee industry as a whole. It has increased the demand for high-quality coffee beans, and has encouraged coffee farmers to focus on producing the best possible product. This, in turn, has led to a focus on sustainability, with many coffee farmers adopting environmentally-friendly practices and working to improve the lives of their workers.\n\nOne of the biggest impacts of the rise of specialty coffee has been on the way coffee is marketed and sold. In the past, coffee was often sold in bulk, with little attention paid to its quality or origin. However, with the rise of specialty coffee, the focus has shifted to selling coffee by the cup, and highlighting its unique flavor and origin. This has resulted in a more personalized and interactive experience for consumers, and has helped to drive the popularity of specialty coffee.\n\nThe rise of specialty coffee has also had an impact on the way coffee is consumed. In the past, coffee was often consumed for its caffeine content and as a quick pick-me-up. However, with the rise of specialty coffee, the focus has shifted to the flavor and enjoyment of the coffee itself. Consumers are now more interested in trying different coffee varieties and experimenting with different brewing methods.\n\nSpecialty coffee has also had a positive impact on the coffee industry as a whole. The increased demand for high-quality coffee has led to the development of new coffee-making techniques and the creation of new coffee-related products. This has resulted in a more vibrant and exciting coffee industry, and has helped to create new opportunities for coffee farmers, roasters, and coffee shops.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of [special coffee](https://specialtybatch.com/) has had a significant impact on the coffee industry. It has driven the demand for high-quality coffee, encouraged sustainability and ethical practices, and has helped to create a more personalized and interactive coffee experience for consumers. The rise of specialty coffee shows no signs of slowing down, and it is likely that it will continue to play an important role in shaping the future of the coffee industry.",

        "text": "I have a Capresso Infinity Conical Burr Grinder.  It grinds well enough to my liking for espresso, but only if I pull the top off and dust off the burrs every now and then (read: few days) - if I don't, some grounds get stuck between upper and lower burrs and the grind gets coarser and makes worse espresso.  This is entirely doable, but annoying since I don't grind all the beans I pour in each time, so sometimes I am opening, cleaning, refilling partway through grinding enough for a double shot since taking off a loaded hopper to clean the burrs isn't doable.\n\nWhat's not entirely clear is how much better the low retention grinders really are - most seem to be single dose-ish, but I don't feel like measuring out a dose as much as grinding the approx amount by feel based on how much was left from a previous time.  I also don't really like how I currently have to compensate for the grind volume in the chute if I switch between types of beans. \n\n**Are low retention models such as Turin SD40, Baratza Sette 270, or Niche Zero actually going to solve my annoyance, or just move me on to other annoyances?**\nI assume if the burs don't keep grounds near them then I don't need to open to clean as much which means the hopper doesn't need to be pulled off while full of beans.  The other benefit of low retention means I can switch beans without needing to clear a chute / refill the chute.",

I thought it might cause rust on the burrs so I asked Baratza support if they recommended this practice  (or didn't), and I got this response.\n\n\"Great question! It is totally okay to give the coffee a small spritz before grinding the coffee. This will help with static! Our burrs are made of a high-carbon steel, and the surface is susceptible to react with any moisture or humidity in the air. However, we rate our burrs to last up to 500lbs which for most folks lasts ten years or more of grinding. Small amounts of surface rust may be present on the burrs but will quickly disappear after just a few pounds of use and is not harmful.  \nHere are a few extra steps we follow:  \n1- let the grinder rest 30-60 seconds after the grind is complete to let static dissipate.  \n2- give the grounds bin a \"knock knock\" to dislodge clinging coffee particles.  \n3- consider wetting a butterknife and stirring your dose of whole beans with it while resting in the hopper. Just a little water greatly reduces heavy static.\"",
