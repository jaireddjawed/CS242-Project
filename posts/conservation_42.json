I spent a semester abroad (New Zealand) this past Spring and was astounded at how integrated conservation efforts can be in other governments. \nI currently work at Zoo Knoxville in the Shows department. We work to provide guests with educational and interactive programs in which we handle animals and strive to always include conservation messages. \nI'm reaching out in this subreddit because I'm starting to look into programs for my Master's in Conservation Science, and I would like to focus in herpetology (as they're often treated as underdogs in the States). I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas of great programs in (or probably preferably) out of the US for next year. Also, if there are any research projects going on the area, I'd love to get more involved. Thanks for reading!",
