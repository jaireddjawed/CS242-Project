        "text": "You can be forgive if you missed it, apparently most people did. It's a little strange considering what a prominent figure Moore was on the left just a few years ago, especially given that he's releasing things at a time when people on the left are hyperfocused on politics.\n\nI think 90% of that probably just has to do with Moore's fading celebrity. He more or less disappeared after *Capitalism a Love Story*, and even before then public interest in him was clearly waning.\n\nI also think you can say he just doesn't really fit in anywhere at this particular political moment. Back in the 2000s, disaffected people on the left were so starved for people who who'd unapologetically argue their ideals that they were ready to totally latch onto Moore as a common reference point. Nowadays, though, there are a lot more things people can go to for pretty much the same thing, like Chapo Trap House and so forth.\n\nMoreover, center left Resistance types probably don't want to hear from a gadfly like Moore who's going to call out Democrats for being spineless/duplicitous while he advocates for things like worker managed cooperatives. I've seen leftists occasionally complain that Moore is a bit of a limousine liberal or oversimplifies things, but I think mostly they've been turned off to Moore on more stylistic grounds. Namely \"I'm going to address issues by making a snarky documentary\" is just seen as bougie and ineffectual.\n\nThat's a bit of a shame. I have a soft spot for Moore, he probably did do quite a bit to rebuild the left in the dark pit that was the 80s/90s/ early to mid-2000s. He knows his craft, and by most accounts, Fahrenheit 11/9 is about as good as any of his previous outings.",

        "text": "No, I'm not talking about the prison that y'all most likely have heard of. That's another ball park.\n\nAccording to [Clifton Hicks and Steven Casey](http://www1.therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=1138) of the 1st Squadron of the 1st US Cavalry Regiment (both Privates in C Troop at the time of the massacre):\n\n&gt;[M]y troop was specifically instructed by our troop commander, a captain, that a particular sector we were moving to recon enforce [in the Abu Ghraib neighbourhood] was now considered a free-fire zone. I specifically recall him telling us that there were, quote, \"no friendlies in the area,\" and then he specifically said, \"Game on. All weapons free.\"\n\nThe two then describe the carnage they saw as they drove down the streets of Abu Ghraib:\n\n&gt;Upon arrival in the area, we found the streets, besides being littered with wreckage of, you know, vehicles, who knows if it's a civilian or an enemy vehicle? There's no way to tell. But wreckage of vehicles. There wasn't a single building in this neighborhood that hadn't had a hole shot through it or something explode inside of it. This place was totally destroyed. The streets were littered with numerous human and animal corpses, not just men, but all manner of humanity. I personally saw no military gear or weapons of any kind on any of the bodies that I came across. I personally did not fire my weapon on this operation. But I do know that other members of my unit embraced the weapons-free order, for example by firing indiscriminately into occupied civilian vehicles and at civilians themselves, using both personal weapons, such as rifles, and cruiser vehicle-mounted weapons, such as machine guns, coaxial machine guns of various caliber.\n\nLater on, the two were informed by their platoon leader that a \"whiz kid\" in their platoon had crunched the numbers, and that an estimated **700 to 800 people had been killed.** Hicks has confirmed that this is likely the case:\n\n&gt;And as you just heard, and I'll agree to that, and I'll agree to swear to that to the day I die, I didn't see one enemy on that operation, but 700 to 800 of them got killed. Judging from what I saw on the ground, I'm willing to swear under oath in all honesty that while many enemy combatants were in fact killed, the majority of those so-called KIAs were in fact civilians attempting to flee the battlefield.\n\nSo probably about 350 to 400 civilians dead by Hicks' rough estimate. About the same as US estimates for My Lai.\n\n**EDIT:** Also if y'all want more information on the massacre (and Iraq/Afghanistan war crimes in general), check out the Winter Soldier testimonies in which Hicks and Casey first spoke out about it. There's also an Eyes Left podcast episode in which Hicks guest stars and talks about the massacre and his time in Iraq.",
