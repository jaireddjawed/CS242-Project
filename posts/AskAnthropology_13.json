In particular my research looks at the evolution of 'fictional competency', the kinds of cognitive capacities that allow us to engage with our culture's stories and storytelling practices.  In my reading I've found quite a lot of anthropological work on the *content* of myths, legends, folk tales, etcetera, but less on the storytelling practices themselves.  I'm interested in how, developmentally, children are inducted in to their respective culture's storytelling practices.  I haven't come across a lot of work in this area, so if there are any suggestions, I'd be grateful for them.\n\nBut my question here is essentially whether fictional narratives can be considered a cultural universal.  Are there any examples of cultures who don't engage in explicitly fictional storytelling?  By explicitly fictional I mean stories where both the storyteller and the receiver understand the non-veridical nature of the narrative.  Not really stories that are intended as creation myths, or recounting historical events, etcetera, but stories that are known to be about people and events that have never existed.  I'm curious about this, because it's often assumed that 'fiction' as a category exists in every culture, and I'm wondering whether this really is the case.\n\nThanks in advance for your replies :)",

Long story short, I grew up being abused by my family, peers, even teachers growing up. From 3rd grade to 11th grade (a short hiatus in 11 and 12th grade where I had fun for the first time in my life) and then again I was bullied after high school for 6 years when I joined the military. \n\nI had no social skills, I was an outcast everywhere I went. I was a constant target.\n\nFast forward to today. I’ve been working HARD for years and years to fix my extreme social anxiety and lack of social skills. I’ve gone from my lip quivering just because I’m on the phone or because I have to talk to someone in real life, to being able to carry on an endless conversation with a beautiful women without being nervous in the slightest (if you’re a guy with crazy social anxiety you know how hard that is! It’s impossible!!!)\n\nSo now back to the alpha beta thing. With my newfound social skills, I have learned SO MUCH. For example, I can spot a guy lacking social skills from a distance. I can tell by the way they walk, how they stand, everything. I see it clear as day and maybe that’s because I have previous experience being that guy.\n\nI deal with guys who are like how I was daily. They always get treated like crap. It seems to me that humans have this natural instinct the take a dump on the people who lack social skills the most.\n\nWhat’s up with that? Does this have something to do with the alpha beta hierarchy?\n\nIn any case, I know on a certain level that it’s kind of BS because you can move up and down that hierarchy quite quickly it seems. You’re never solidified and your life is generally yours to choose. You can get anywhere you like if you put enough work in and this seems to me by definition to break the idea of hierarchies.\n\nBut I just can’t get over how I see humans interacting in social settings.\n\nAs I continue to learn more and more and get better and better at social skills, I learn to love people more and more.\n\nUs humans, we like other humans a lot. And we like those of us who express ourselves. Those of us who feel comfortable with expressing their inner quirkiness are always the most liked and loved people. I used to be terrified to be my weirdo self, but now I’ve learned I can be a complete weirdo and people will love me for it.\n\nSo maybe the alpha-beta crap is truly BS because really, what’s happening is people who encounter those who fear self expression, become “confused” in their presence. And it does feel a bit weird these days when I do interact with people with terrible social skills. But knowing my life, I always try to be myself with them and hope they learn something from me.\n\nI still don’t get why we get targeted for bullying though. And that’s what makes me sort of believe there’s at least a little truth to it.\n\nAnother point is that, at least as a guy, in terms of dating, me learning to express myself has helped a lot. It’s been a long and confusing journey and I’m still trying to figure it out. But if we are thinking about percentages of populations, I imagine that those of us with very little social skills are highly unlikely to date or reproduce. Women like men who are confident and self expressive.\n\nThen again, being shy and unsociable obviously directly leads to not getting laid, and is not necessarily a product of any kind of hierarchy. \n\nSo yea, what’s the real reality? Sorry for the long post. But I like to use my own perspective and life experience. I detest acting like a robot. I express myself even on the internet (which I’ve found actually seems to have the opposite effect as real life.) I also believe in dramatizing real life to gain a better understand of what’s going on in every aspect. I think it works but that’s another topic entirely.",

        "text": "I am wondering about situations in which an anthropologist is \"studying up\", that is, studying a culture of power. To what extent must a researcher be open about their research goals, even when that openness could completely undermine the goals? It seems to me that when \"studying down\" (which is 'traditional' anthropology), there is usually less at stake for the research subjects. They may lack the perspective to know how their participation in research will affect the perceptions of a society they have had little to no contact with, and frankly they may be indifferent to the opinions of far-away people with whom they will never meet or be affected by. For example, consider a hunter-gatherer society such as the Hadza... do they give a damn what academic anthropologists are writing about them? Doubtful. \n\nIn contrast, when \"studying up\", the subjects may be very aware of public perceptions and be concerned about problematic aspects of their culture or conduct being exposed to the public. For example, consider the anthropological study presented in the book [Liquidated](https://www.amazon.com/Liquidated-Ethnography-Street-Franklin-Center/dp/0822345994/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535408844&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=liquidated). People working in Wallstreet investment banks are likely to be very sensitive to the prying of a researcher from a notoriously liberal discipline, which poses an enormous barrier to collecting ethnographic data. So what is considered ethical practice here? How much must a researcher divulge to their subjects before embarking on ethnographic research on the powerful and intensely image conscious? \n\nI am especially curious about cases in which access to certain types of information simply could not be attained without a certain level of deception - white lies at a minimum. For example, if one is interested in studying the culture of a corporation that one believes to be corrupt and problematic, but the only way \"in\" is to get a job, and if you open with \"I am an anthropologist who is interested in working for this corporation so that I can study and write about how fucked up it is\" probably won't get you in. But this means a lot of critical research simply cannot be done, and arguably, this is the sort of anthropological work that would be most directly relevant and beneficial to modern society. ",

Ancient sites are fine too, although I think that applying virtual reality to an ancient site involves a separate host of issues. If you are skeptical of the use of virtual reality in the field, could you expand upon why you think so? I already have some critiques of my own, but I see a lot of promise in using VR, especially as a means to educate the general public and aid in historical preservation. I will be posting this in archaeology subreddits as well, but since my work straddles the lines between history, archaeology and anthropology, I wanted to ask here as well. Thanks!",

When talking about the Americas, he mentions that\n\n&gt;\"About 15,000 years ago, the American West looked much as Africa's Sarengeti Plains do today, with herds of elephants and horses pursued by lions and cheetahs and joined by members of such exotic species as camels and giant ground sloths.\"\n\nNow, the book in its entirety is based on the \"Out-of-Africa\" theory, which I take is the prevailing theory in this field. However, if species such as lions, cheetahs, and others typically found in Africa today were present in the Americas 15,000 years ago, how do we know that humans were not popping up in the Americas at the same time that they were first propagating in Africa tens of millions of years ago?\n\nDid lions and cheetahs make it to the Americas \\*before\\* humans? This seems unlikely (though I'm not sure why). My first intuition is that lions and cheetahs popped up in the Americas *in tandem* with Africa. Is there any evidence that this occured?\n\nIf lions and cheetahs were evolving in tandem in the Americas and Africa, is it unreasonable to think that humans may have been doing the same? How were lions and cheetahs driven out of the Americas (presumably by humans), but not driven out of Africa?",

Some of the articles I read suggested this cave was likely either a place they were staying or a place they stopped at temporarily, and may have been a gathering place. \n\nMy question is, do we know WHY there are so many remains in this cave? Do we know how it’s inhabitants died? If it was a meeting place or living space, it seems odd to me that the inhabitants would bury their dead there, as opposed to a space a little further away from where they eat and sleep. Do we know if it was a conscious choice to bury dead there, or if these different people may have died suddenly in accidents over the years leading to the collection of bones?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I am currently starting a PhD in Eucation Studies in a department with a very heterodox apparoach to the field which allows me to pursue my research in a somewhat anthropological fashion following my previous cursus. My thesis project is to study the production and spread of the *Pokémon* franchise, focusing on what's going on online. My supervisors are, a sociologist specialized on online gaming whose approach is socioanthropological, and my other supervisor (the one habilitated to supervise) is a former student of Luc Boltanski and thus very influenced by his \"sociology of critique\". \n\nWhen writing my thesis project to get a grant, I had to negociate my approach between those of my supervisors, the one I felt like going for, and my many influences (\"sociologie pragmatique\", cultural/social/cognitive anthropology, game studies, fan studies...), as well as to bring in some socioeconomics due to the institute that offered the grants. The problem was of course that we needed a theoritical framework to guide all of that. We found that pretty late when he suggested we take our problematics from the angle of anthropology of emotions (I can't even recall how that idea came to him), which was a delightful surprise for me as, at some point, I contemplated the idea of specializing in a digital anthropology of emotions.\n\nFrom this, I started to try and draw bridges between and articulate several of my influences to try and make a decent project (which seemed to be solid enough as it got me the grant). Doing so, I realized there seems to be a strong link between sociology of critique and the anthropology of emotion I want to \"build\" (non-native speaker, I can't find a better word). I plan to draw on Lutz and the likes, in a way, but I don't want to embrace a fully constructivist approach either. I basically plan to look at the articulation of the cognitive dimension of emotions with the marketing strategies/technological/sociotechnical context and the local production of emotionnal norms and practices. This is pretty close to what William M. Reddy is doing with his ethnolographical history approach, through his concepts like \"emotionnal regimes\", I believe. And this looks a lot like what \"sociology of critique\" aimed at : articulating critical sociology and more \"individualistic\" sociologies such as \"sociologie pragmatique\" (which incidentally has strong ties to cognitive sciences). And doing so by building its critical concepts on social critique as it is practised by people. Much like an anthropologist of emotions would build his categories of thought drawing primarily those of \"indigenous\" people. \n\nI believe I'm not the only one to see this pattern (maybe not between sociology of critique and anthropology of emotions). Plus, my knowledge on sociology of critique is shallow and my intuition may be wrong. So, for the actual question, has anyone had the chance to give a thought on the potential links between sociology of critique and contemporary anthropology ? Are there some references mentionning that ? Is there actually anything interesting to it ? ",

        "text": "So...I've been doing searches on google/wikipedia/askanthropologists/askhistorians, and...so far I seem to be left with the answer of \"people disagree about the tree structure of Afro-Asiatic\".  Like here's the wikipedia section on people disagreeing (which cites nothing newer than 2000):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages#Subgrouping\n\nAnd they even made a [disagreement chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages#/media/File:Afroasiatic.svg).\n\nBut...is it really as controversial as Wikipedia claims?  With no major advances in 18+ years to bring people to a consensus?\n\nLike...I don't know linguistics, but I'm a computer programmer and have a pretty good sense of how computers get things wrong and why.  Looking at [this computer generated tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages#/media/File:Afroasiatic.svg) and zooming in on afro-asiatic languages...obviously there are blatant mistakes; Nilo-Saharan languages being classified under afro-asiatic.  But a few things jump out at me.\n\n1. Semitic, Omotic, and Berber are 100% self contained.  Even the computer can see these language groupings.\n2. Chadic is mostly self-contained, but confused the computer in a few ways.  Includes a few Nilo-Saharan languages that don't belong, and also the computer thinks Berber is a branch off of Chadic.  This to me suggests that Chadic probably has a lot more linguistic diversity (which could indicate that it might be an older tree than Berber, Semitic, and Omotic, or at least one with more surviving diversity).\n3. Cushitic is a gigantic mess, which seems to lend credibility to the linguists who call for splitting Cushitic up into multiple categories.\n\nOn the other hand, something I definitely would not trust from the computer-generated tree, it puts Beja as being a somewhat close relative to Semitic languages, but based on [this highly detailed AskHistorian answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4dlibk/is_there_an_asian_or_african_analogous_theory_to/d2tp7zv/) by u/asrafael \"the Beja are currently undergoing heavy Arabization, which they have for nearly 1000 years\" (that probably confuses the computer program into seeing similarities with Arabic).  The reply also notes that \"Cushitic speakers have not only a cultural/linguistic heritage from the proto-Cushitic group, but the vast majority (if not all) of their genetic ancestry as well.\"  For all these Cushitic languages to be descended from one proto-Cushitic language, proto-Cushitic would need to be extremely old, but the reddit answer covers that too \"since proto-Cushitic predates proto-Indo-European by thousands of years to a time period when the Horn of Africa and most of the world was made up of hunter-gatherer bands\" (which puts the date for proto Cushitic at Neolithic, and probably early at that).\n\nOK, so to summarize what I think I know...Chadic and Cushtic are very old, or at least very diverse, and likely spots for the origin of Afro-Asiatic is...close to one of those.  Right, so...then I read this Encyclopedia Britanica article:\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Afro-Asiatic-languages\n\nAnd suddenly I'm confused again by quotations like this:\n\n\"Largely extralinguistic research based on the “out of Africa” theory for Homo sapiens sapiens has since placed the Urheimat in the Middle East—in the Fertile Crescent, one of the regions in which agriculture developed (c. 10,000 BCE).\"\n\nUm...what?  What is this extralinguistic research of which they speak, and how does it let them pinpoint the geographic origin of a language tree?",

        "text": "I've been contemplating this a lot. At my university, in 1964, the #1 requested new department by undergraduates was anthropology. Now, students have not idea what anthropology is, and if they do, it's usually what I see in this thread -- questions that assume primitiveness, looking into the past, etc.\n\nI deeply value and appreciate archaeology, primatology, evolutionary, and all other biological or physical anthropologies. But cultural anthropology has, bar none, the best tools among the social sciences and humanities for understanding the world as we live in it today, and it seems that so many are missing out on this because of assumptions that cultural anthropologists only study \"the primitive\" -- a concept that we almost entirely threw out decades ago! It's like, in public perception, cultural anthro is still stuck in the 1970s.\n\nIt's extra frustrating, because among most grad students and junior faculty I know across the social sciences, many are reading contemporary cultural and linguistic anthropology to make up for some of the shortfalls in their disciplines -- I've met sociologists, education studies, geographers, political scientists, and historians who feel this way, and enjoy reading contemporary ethnography.\n\nSome of it may also be other disciplines dumping on cultural anthro. I have heard folks from cultural studies, WGS, and sociology (of course) making very stereotyped tropes about the kinds of work we do, again reflecting that 1970s view of the discipline's focus on the Other.\n\nPart of this, I think, is the failure of the AAA and cult/ling anthros generally to do good outreach to the public. When our campus does a community outreach day, the cultural and ling anthros often don't even bother to put up a table, because we don't want to use racialized tropes to get across what we do. (And there's understandable reluctance to have a presentation, on a fun day, that would run like \"hey, this is what we understand about racisms, domination, subjectification, and social suffering and violence. Oh, and by the way, we understand in large part our complicity in the colonial endeavor, and here is how we've theoretically, and today, try to disassemble some of the structures and tropes we ourselves helped produce...\") \n\nBut surely there's a better way to communicate our discipline in ways that excite or engage people. When students finally do \"get\" cultural anthropology, they're often astounded and remain 'anthropological thinkers' for the rest of their lives.\n\nBut I wonder, how do we get out of this rut of misunderstanding and miscommuniciation? Cultural anthropology has changed my life profoundly and forever, and I wish I could better extend that to the public. Current public engagement projects are clearly failing. Apart from introducing anthropology as part of a standard high school curriculum, how do we get even those interested in anthropology -- like those that come to this sub -- to look beyond physical, and extend our concepts so that we can all understand the world we live in and ourselves in better and more interesting ways? I see more questions that are right in the wheelhouse of cultural and linguistic anthropology being asked over in the r/askhistorians sub than I do here...",

Would it be best to enbalm my body in formaldehyde, or would it be better to bury myself in a desert or a glacier so that natural mummification could occur? Is it better to be buried near my place of living or in an area well suited for body preservation?\n\n\nSecondly, lets think about how my grave should be marked. Would a plastic gravestone be durable enough to be legible in the future? Should I take precautions against grave robbers?\n\n\nAnd lastly, what should I be buried with? Maybe some shrink wrapped clothes and food from my time period, maybe some photos of my life perhaps? Lets say I wrote an autobiography and had it buried with me, would it be important to have it translated into other major languages like spanish, arabic etc, or is english good enough?\n\n\n\nWhat are the aspects of life historians and archeologists oftentimes miss about ancient people and how could I communicate those with future peoples?\n\n\n\n\nSorry if this isn’t a good question to ask, but I thought it could be interesting to think about.",
