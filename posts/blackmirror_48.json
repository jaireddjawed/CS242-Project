        "text": "Preface: this isn't evidence based, just a fan theory.  \n  \nI've seen people on here try to guess what lead to the world of Metalhead.  My guess is that it's the end game for the White Bear Justice Park.  Two of the big questions in White Bear is does Victoria stay there forever, and if not what happens after?  I doubt one particular criminal stays in White Bear more than a month or two.  At that point, the public will grow bored and they will want to move on to the next.  \n  \nThis is where Metalhead comes in.  Metalhead is a military testing site.  In White Bear we've already seen that society at large cares little for the welfare of prisoners.  So, it goes to assume instead of just executing prisoners, they would want to make use of them first.  The three people we see in Metalhead are all on death row.  They're dropped into Metalhead with their memories replaced, and a set of actors (the sister and 'sick' child) work like the actors in White Bear, moving the criminals along.  This way, society gets a little more value from its prisoners, gathering information about the weaknesses of the robots.  In one episode, a TV ticker mentions the army because testing on combat robots, and I think that's referencing the events in Metalhead.",

        "text": "Hey,\n\nso maybe I'm a bit late to the party, but I just had to share my views on the first episode of season 4, also because I couldn't find them anywhere else on this subreddit:\n\nTbh, I didn't think this episode had a happy ending and I didn't think Daly was too bad of a person.\nLet me start with the fact, that all of the characters IN the game are purely an artificial intelligence (AI). They are simply some code on his PC that don't have actual feelings and stuff. Sure, you can program them to act like they have them, to behave like actual humans, but they aren't. They are like realistic Sims. \nNow let's say you can actually copy a whole person + his memories and behavior with the DNA (the second part which I don't think will ever be possible), they would then still be code, and could be manipulated. Why wouldn't Daly just make them obedient? Or at least some of them. And even then, why would anybody care how Daly treats them? Oh poor code, imitating fear etc. I really couldn't care for any of them, since I knew they weren't actual human beings. And the fact that the episode ends with some AI escaping and the real human possibly dying (at least it seems implied), I don't understand how that could be a happy ending...\n\nDon't get me wrong, the fact that he stole everybody's DNA and how he behaved in-game, especially with Walton's kid, is very strange and he definitely has some psychological issues. But if your best friend murdered everybody in Skyrim, would you care? Or judge him? Or would you judge him by the way he behaved in real life? And what bad has Daly done in real life? He should've spoken up to Walton or seen someone and try to fix his problems that way. But letting it all out in some very realistic computer game isn't the worst method either, definitely not for anybody but him.\n\nWhat I honestly take out of this episode is:\n\n-Have some backbone\n\n-Make sure AI wouldn't endanger an actual human\n\n-Give your AI  genitals\n\nEDIT: As some people have pointed out, my Skyrim comparison isn't quite the same as virtually killing/torturing/oppressing people you know in real life. At least on a psychological level. On the level of actual real life consequences though, it's pretty much the same. One code might be more sophisticated, but it's still Ones and Zeros, not flesh and blood. ",

Lets have it become a nightmare world because either Yorkie or Kelly don't believe they deserve to be happy.\n\nMen Against Fire - The twist is kinda predictable. Lets have it turn out Stripe's MASS system malfunctioned and the Roaches really are mutants. I know the show hasn't used straight up monsters before but that's what makes it so unpredictable.\n\nArkangel - Instead of censoring things, Marie uses Arkangel to make Sara afraid of things Marie thinks might hurt her. This is something a helicopter parent is more likely to do. She also doesn't deactivate the tablet. As a result, Sara is still a social outcast and emotional immature at 15. At 16, the Arkangel system deactivates and Sara has to live without its effects. By 21, she manages to become reasonably adjusted but Marie finds a way to hack her Arkangel tablet and try to \"protect\" Sara. The aborting Sara's pregnancy part happens at this age.\n\nCrocodile - We see the episode from the POV of the police investigating. They use the Recaller to scan memories of people who might know something.\n\nBlack Museum - Clayton is actually guilty. The whole point of his segment is whether a finite crime should carry an infinite punishment. Making him innocent defeats the whole point.\n\nTake out the part where Nish has her mum in her head.

        "text": "then I've went to discussion thread and I'm surprised how many people loved it. In my opinion it was the worst episode to his point (3x4). Whole premise for the idea wasn't that original (I feel like cookie stuff was very similar) and the episode most of the time (pretty much until the ending) was just boring for me. It didn't feel like black mirror at all. There was this powerful scene where Kelly explains to the other woman why she's not going to stay in SJ, only to be ruined by her change of mind, just like that. I thought maybe Kelly decided to pass over to found out that her wife opted-out, but nothing like this happened and ending just left cheesy taste in my mouth.\n\nSo what I think is that the last scenes with the girls were their last day together - as Kelly saying good bye. And insides of SJ company, with moving capsules and stuff was to indicate that Kelly is opting-out from the system.\n\ndon't hate me, but I think (some) people loved this episode, because it was about lesbians.\n\n",

One would think that this technology is super-advanced, but if you remember in USS Callister, pizza was still getting delivered by humans so we weren't high-enough-tech yet to get to self-driving pizza trucks. \n\nBut here's the thing. The technology in the USS Callister seemed WAY more advanced than a memory reader that can only get glimpses and pieces of memories and they aren't always 100% acurite and can often be blurry. \n\nWhich makes me wonder... How is self-driving technology shown in an episode where consciousness technology isn't that much advanced, where in an earlier episode, consciousness technology was more advanced but we (seemingly) have self-driving cars?

We talked about how google traffic data is used, Amazon shows adds based on search history, my Mi phone is selling all my data to the Chinese.\nAfter a while I asked if anyone has seen black mirror. Nobody had. So I told them the story of what happens when a mother puts a 'chip' in her daughter (Arkangle S04). They were quite disturbed by the story. \nAfter a silent strech for few minutes one of my friends showed me his mobile. There was an 'add' for Black Mirror on his facebook feed.\n",
