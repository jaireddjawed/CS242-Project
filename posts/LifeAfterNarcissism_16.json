I work in customer service and against my better judgement I gave my Facebook to a customer who has turned out to be possibly unstable and maybe a little obsessive. There were a lot of red flags I ignored because I just felt bad for her, she seemed lonely and like she needed a friend.  She has liked every single one of my posts back to 2009. I'm at a loss for what to do here. She knows where I work and generally what town I live in, and has my real name.  I'm a little bit afraid and I've never been in this situation before.

My therapist suggested just reminding myself it's me projecting again, but I was wondering if anyone else has other methods? I know it's super common as a lasting effect of those with Nparents or even parents with borderline, so I figured this may be a good place to ask.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/8eiz2c/i_found_out_my_bio_father_is_an_arsehole_after_18/",
        "text": "Okay so, I haven’t posted on this sub before but now I just need somewhere to vent I have left names in because because I really do not give a shit any more. I am angry and hurt. This will be a long post. This is also a vent.\n\nTL;DR: My so-called father demands respect after finding me after 18 years. I ask for space after moving house and whilst I finish university and he responds by being invasive and by being an arsehole.\n\nAfter 18 years of being without a father and almost 4 years without my total evil bitch of a mother I actually found him again and the weirdest thing was that he lived in the same town as me. \n\nWell recently I moved house and I had uni work coming out of my ears so I didn’t exactly have the time to see friends or even do much texting. On the day we moved I sent my father a few messages about the new house and i asked how he and his family were doing also. I did not have family for years so for him to be so close was amazing. Then i was a bit annoyed when he didn’t answer any of my messages. So I send yet another message asking why he hasn’t responded, I can see that he has seen them and all that and that it won’t take him 5 minutes to respond a simple answer to me.\n\nThen I get this:\n\n“Hey you! That's not true. Here’s some well-meant but harsher words of advice from your old dad. Make of it what you like.\n\nIt may seem to you that I am being silly regards your move across town. So to put it into perspective, one day you may well be a parent. When the time comes that your children decide to leave home, make their own life and appear to no longer need you, only then will you understand the emotions that it brings about  under such circumstances - that I feel now about you. Hopefully you will have enjoyed watching your children grow and flourish, having nurtured them through childhood, taken them on holidays etc. I haven’t done that for you. You lived around the corner. Now you’ve moved further away, however short a distance that is. It leaves a hollow feeling. It’s as simple as that. There’s no changing it. I spoke with FRIEND. She felt the same when her boys SON1 and SON2 left home. Don't take it personally. It's nothing you've done wrong.\n\nI am not one of your mother’s ‘bits on the side’ or her low-life husband. I am your dad whom you came looking for and I’m very pleased you did because I love you dearly. I am ready and willing to be a proper dad to you now and will do a better job than I have in the past or than the others who pretended to do so in my absence. My friends call me Tony or Anthony. My children call me dad. Never again will I accept having to take a back seat or come second place to anyone in future who thinks they’ll play dad to you. That includes your present company. I won’t be taken for a fool.\n\nAlso, I would appreciate you showing me a little more reverence and respect. Not for you to look at my wedding day picture for example, compliment Angie on how amazing she looks, and then call me a ‘prick’ to her. Whether you are joking or not. And especially don’t do it in front of brother and sister. brother and sister don’t speak to me, or about me like that, and I don’t like it from you either. Don’t insult me by calling me weird, or a dick or a pleb. Save that sort of talk for your mother and her husband. When you have been with your man for over 21 years, borne his children, made a marriage work with him and built a home together which is bought and paid for, as I have with Angie and with no previous failed marriages to look back on, then you will really have achieved something.\n\nYou still have a lot to learn and would do well to develop a little more finesse and decorum, not to keep swearing and belching in public or in company, or sticking your fingers up at me for example when I try to take a nice picture of you showing off your beautiful hair, or for no other reason than because I am proud of you and think you are perfect. Such behaviour is what I expect from Sue. She is coarse, common, of low intelligence, ignorant, unpleasant, ungracious, selfish and vindictive, a liar and stupid. You are of a much higher calibre and intelligence, you possess finer qualities and you have the potential to make a successful life for yourself. Perhaps learn to be a little more ladylike. It would suit you and do you much credit. \n\nThere is so much I want to do for you, even now you are an adult, and to make up for my failings as a parent not being there for you as a child when it could have made a difference for you. There are places I want to take you; people I want you to meet; things I would like to teach you that will be useful to you; holidays I would love to have you share with us in the same way you now do with your future in-laws.\n\nSo never be afraid to ask me for anything. I might not always be able to give it there and then, but I will always try to do everything possible within my means to help you. Because I love and cherish every minute spent in your company. I can’t help missing you when you are not around.\n\nLooking forward also to a special birthday that’s coming up. I’ve missed your last 18 including your 21st. Your new found family and siblings love you and want to be there for you for your next one, and every other one after that, unless of course you have other plans.\nAnd in the meantime, focus on your uni work, not me and go get that grade.\nAll my love.”\n\nNow I want to make very clear that this, I feel, that this was a personal attack on myself. I feel that this was really uncalled for and I spent a week trying to figure out what to say. I typed up so many words and deleted them so many times. I can't believe he just demanded that I respect him like his other kids do. That shocked me a bit and it just gave me shivers about what Sue used to do. Of course now I will never call him dad. I'm pretty sure its a normal thing anyway for adults who have found parents to call them by their first names since they barely know them. To me calling him \"dad\" seems more... Intimate? more... Relateable? I am not even sure what it is. But I do not want it.\n\nI mean okay I know I can be an arsehole but he never mentioned anything to me. I told him that I would be honest. He told me I could trust him. Now I feel like the fool.\n\nI am very comfortable in my skin, I could stand to lose a few pounds and probably think a little nicer but that is it. I have not called him a name and meant it, only as a joke and he has fired the same right back at me. He demands respect but he has to earn it. He treats me like a child and seems fixated on making me look like the bad guy, an unstable adult and a horrible person. Yes maybe i crossed the line but he has never said anything to my face. Not even a phone call. He made it clear to me (not over text) that he does like a drink in the evenings which is when both of these messages occurred so my best guess is that he was drunk. \n\nThen yesterday happened and i got 4 text messages, a messenger message and two emails off of him. In one day. After what I have been through with my mother I found it creepy and unnerving. He then showed up at my place of work with my half sister who is 12. There were not many words said and it was only a brief visit. He left me with this tacky little heart ornament that said “daughter” and a load of other cheap words on it (I didn’t care to read it at this point, besides I was at work WHERE I CAN’T HAVE MY PHONE ON ME SO I WAS UNAWARE OF THE MESSAGES)\n\nLater that evening I tell him that I would like a bit of time and space because of work and university and deadlines and that our relationship has happened so quickly and it was a lot to happen all at once. In my own time I would come to him and we could talk this out. After all I was still mulling over his last text and how to handle that. \n\nBut he didn’t want to leave me be so I then get this email:\n\n“Dear Ballzy124,\nWhat an utter load of rubbish you came out with this evening. Needing your space? You sounded like a frightened teenager. Grow up Ballzy124. I am your dad and I am busy too. I have Peter and Jemma to consider, and a wife, and a business to run. But I still have time for you after 18 years. So if there’s something bothering you, then I am interested to hear about it and to help if I can.\n \nWe are all busy. I have not crowded you in any way. I left you alone last week to get on with your studies because I know how important it is to you. I heard nothing from you for a whole week. I texted and messaged you last Monday morning to wish you well with your studies. Apart from a cursory response from you just after midday that day, I heard nothing more from you all week or over the weekend and I didn’t trouble you because I knew you were busy.\n \nMy day out with Sister in London last week made me realise I am the most important man in her life. That is a good feeling for a dad to have about his daughter. I would have thought it would make you proud as well to know how much you are thought of. But I realise that I am not that to you, I never have been, and it seems I never will be as those years have passed and you appear to have others around you now who are seemingly more important to you than any real father/daughter bond we could have.\n \nYou don’t call me dad because you are uncomfortable with the idea because to you it’s weird. To me it just shows your immaturity and creates the impression of being second best to you; a person about whom you were curious but at the same time don’t really want to get too close to. It is disappointing, especially considering you spent so much of your time looking for me.\n \nGetting to a more delicate point: it occurs to me that you are comparing me and expecting me to live up to FIL: telling me to ask MIL how he danced at the recent wedding and asking me to wear a Scottish kilt for your wedding for example just to be the same as him. My guess is that FIL put on a good show at the wedding that made you laugh whilst you were acting silly, getting drunk and being sick. If FIL is the new fatherly figure in your life whom you revere, then what am I to you? What exactly do you want and expect from me? Am I just an object of your curiosity for which the novelty has now worn off? Alan is a nice enough fellow. I like him. But do not forget who your real dad is. And don’t be stupid enough to accuse me of being jealous either. I am way above that.\n \nOn the Wednesday of your move and for two full days afterwards, I heard almost nothing from you. I phoned you that morning to wish you well but received no texts, messages or phone calls from you to let me know how you were getting on. I even offered to help you and I offered my help to MIL as well. It wasn’t until the Friday evening (13th) when you finally sent me a message with a silly picture of you to let me know you were moved in.\n \nYou have a lot of growing up to do and a lot to learn. I am your real father, somebody with a lot more substance and who will be a better dad to you than anyone else who has ever tried. But you have to want to embrace that fully as well, and not to think you can just pick me up and put me down only when it fits in with your lifestyle. Of course, you are free to make your own choices, so march on in your own world if you prefer. I will still be your dad and love you, even if others should ever desert you. But I am not going to follow in somebody else’s shadow and be second best to you.\n \nWhen your mother Sue was your age, she never had a fraction of the abilities and qualities you have. She was a selfish, impatient, demanding and spoilt brat who was tied to her mother’s apron strings. Sue never had a clue about running a home, handling money, budgeting, or working towards building a meaningful future with someone. She had a confrontational, child-like mentality, always only ever looking to satisfy her own wants and desires. Frankly, I was glad to see the back of her when she left because she was an utter pain the arse.\n \nSue’s attitude wasn’t helped by her own mother who knew what she was like but failed to give her good counsel, pandered to her every whim, and then had the front to describe me as a ‘Jekyll and Hyde character’ and ‘insecure’ to my mother. Between them, they portrayed me as the one who was at fault, when really the problem was Sue’s own stupidity, immaturity and low moral standards. Don’t end up being like her. You can do far better than that.\n \nWith me, Sue would not now still be living in social housing and on benefits as you described, and I would have given you a better childhood (look at what sister and brother have - not just material things either). Never was I rude or unpleasant to NAN and we had mainly good rapport. I hope NAN has since realised I could have been a good partner to Sue and son-in-law to her. I hope she also realises I was not the monster Sue made me out to be. It all contributed to the reasons why I broke contact 18 years ago.\n \nTo be brutally frank, I am now long past caring what Sue or any of her family think of me. I am vindicated. I have a good marriage and a fantastic wife, who I have been with for over 21 years and who has given me two wonderful children. I have proved to myself and to Stepmom that I am a good husband and father. There is nothing I want to prove to anyone else anymore.\n \nBallzy124, just to be very clear, I do not like being rough shod over or made a fool of. You are welcome to come and see us whenever you like, and of course go out with your friends and do your own thing as well. My door is always open to you but do not disrespect me, take me for granted, criticise or relegate me in favour of other people.\n \nI hope you will have the good sense and grace to make the best of what I can offer you. I am still young enough and willing to be a good dad to you. I may not be so willing in a few years’ time if you and I fall out now. I cherish the people who really matter but drop those who mess me about.\n \nYou matter and you are an important part of our family. I love you. I always have, and you are also now equally loved by sister, brother and stepmom. I hope it stays that way and that you will visit us often. I am delighted to have you back in my life. You are welcome in our home and I hope we will work on building a good father and daughter bond. Life is harder than you think. Get a grip on it.\n \nI will wait for you to contact me again if and when you are ready.\n \nAll my love to you,\nDad”\n\nThen just now I get this message;\n\n\"Just to be clear, I am not coming into town to face the wrath of a stroppy 21 year old girl who thinks she is going to put her 50 year old dad in his place. I am quite cross at the moment and very busy myself as well now. I did a lot over the Easter break with family including being at home to look after brother and sister whilst they were off school and stepmom was at work. I now need to get on and generate some new business for myself to get some work and money coming in. I suggest you concentrate on your uni work. You know where I am. The door will always be open to you. Speak whenever.\"\n\nAm I going crazy? He has also contacted my Nan, my MIL (who is amazing) and all of this to me just seems really uncalled for. To me this feels like a grab for power and honestly the advice I have already received is telling me to just “play it cool” - how the hell can I play this cool?!\n\nImmature - really? I laughed at that, I have been on my own for such a long time and I had no choice but to \"grow up\" fast in my life. Even though I was stunted. As for being gross like burping - I do not do that in public, only people I feel comfortable with who I can trust. Sometimes the odd one will escape me but doesn't that happen to everyone? I feel like I am being judged for who I am. This had lead to what my SO calls an \"identity crisis\"\n\nI never thought this would effect me so much. All I wanted was acknowledgement but instead I get this. Like, I know I have a lot to learn in life but was this really necessary? \n\nI need time to process this. I need time to be angry. I need time to figure out if I really want him in my life or not. I need...time.\n\nI honestly don’t know how to react and it is a shame because I really did like my new found family. How can he say all of this after a month and a half of knowing me?!\n",

This was entirely his decision because he felt like he had no choice but to give up on me because I don't hold up to expectations. I also have an emotionally neglectful mother and physically abusive brother (the golden child, so no consequences for him. It's always my fault).\n\nDespite all of this, I just learned that my dad is an extreme narcissist probably a week or two ago through self reflection and reading by myself. I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADHD, but I feel like I have undiagnosed CPTSD and struggle to deal with daily life. I may also be dissociating myself from reality because I feel huge gaps in my life and I don't know how I ended up here. I've had \"best friends\" for years but I feel like I failed to absorb any empathy or feelings because I just wasn't there mentally for a huge chunk of my life. Still struggle with relationships and have constant high standards for people close to me but refuse to accept positive empathy/care being put on me.\n\n\nI discussed personal issues with the psychiatrist, but I feel like he does not grasp the magnitude of it and I quit that entirely because opening up these old wounds with no solution only made me shut down more. \n\nI go from periods of higher functioning and decent grades to just completely shutting down and not being able to take trash to the trash can whether I take stimulants or not.\n\nI'm already going to be an entire year late to graduation and I feel like life never felt real to me. Even with stimulants, the process of initiating anything is impossible and varies mostly on my state of mind. If I'm in a robotic, numb state, I can initiate easier but not well. If I'm reminded of the past either consciously or subconsciously, I just shut down. This has been happening unbeknownst to me and it only became clear once I read up on narcissistic parents and CPTSD.\n\nWhat is the best mental health professional that can deal with this situation?\n\nWill a LCSW with specialization in trauma and abuse do? Or do I need a psychologist with a PhD?\n\nDuring consultation visits, what should I ask and what should I look out for?\n\nI feel like psychiatrists (MD) have a different approach and do not understand the deep rooted, emotional aspect of things.\n\nWhat has worked for you?",

When you don't respond to us, you are responsible for our stress levels.\"\n\nMy resolve is unbroken; I am not responding at all unless I get an apology for their behaviour, and then only with concrete, unbreakable boundaries. \n\nThey may not understand it, but they can't have our old relationship back, since this was built on lies, abuse and self-deception. At some point they will have to realise that things can never be the same.\n\nI can't help struggling against the decision somewhat, though - a part of me feels almost that ghosting them *is* unkind, even though I know it's for my own health. Can any of you reassure me - or, if I'm wrong, help me redress my mistake?\n\nUPDATE: As of yesterday, NSis has sent me a tacky hallmark card in an attempt to guilt-trip me into breaking NC (a family of photoshopped meerkats with silly hats captioned \"Just think about what it's like being in our family!\" - or something - recycled it immediately).\n\nNMum, true to form, has texted today saying \"I'm worried that you are unhappy, and it's because of me...you can always come back to us, free of anger or blame\" - which is inCREDibly shady considering her last email said I'd have to come crawling back on my knees if I ever wanted to contact them again.\n\nCoincidentally, my texting app has a \"blacklist\" feature! :~D I should have looked into this previously...\n\nThe creepier aspect is that NMum has specifically said I can come back if I ever need to get out of a situation making me unhappy or anxious. Not just mirroring the numerous times she's made similar offers to get me to come and live with them, but also making some pretty awful implications about my relationship with my Partner.\n\nSo, yes.

        "text": "Long time lurker of the RBN board, first time poster. I'm 20 years old and left my family in a pretty dramatic way almost a year ago \\(made a 3 hour drive with friends to go home and get my important papers and officially cut things off, had to bring a cop with me because I was so scared, sobbed the whole drive back to my apartment with friends\\).  A few months ago, I decided to email my enabler dad, as I always had a slight relationship with him and kind of missed him. He answered, but basically has not completely respected my boundaries of how I don't want to hear about my NMom at all, how at first I didn't want to be contacted unless it was an emergency, and he also hasn't been happy for me in really any sense despite me sharing lots of positive things about my life now. He also has stated that they don't understand why I left.\n\nI'm so confused about the not understanding thing, as for years since the abuse really started I had openly been telling them I wanted to leave and how hurt I was and what specifically was hurting me. But they apparently don't remember. My dad says he wants to have a relationship with him, but I've hurt him a lot apparently. I've hurt the whole family a lot, and they think I'm going to leave again. And sometimes I want to leave again. But I want to try to have at least some sort of closure on the matter with my dad, the one who was the most understanding about my feelings when I was growing up and at least protected me from my mom once in a while, even if he would make me apologize for making her abuse me. \n\nI have been struggling with feeling extremely alone lately. I've gotten myself into a lot of fwb situations and it's starting to make me feel even more isolated and less desireable, but if I ditch the fwb's I will be even more alone. I am in contact with my aunt who has been extremely supportive about this entire experience and is the only 'real' family I have right now, and I brought up to her how I'm debating emailing my dad's parents \\(my grandparents\\) as well, but I'm hesitant because they also enabled a lot of the abuse and encouraged me not to leave when I went to them about my problems. She thinks it could go either way, and I am leaning towards emailing them, but I have no idea how to even start that interaction. \n\nI don't know if this is super coherent, I just need some advice on what to do with all of this weird stuff happening in my life right now. I'm really lost.",

When told, I immediately recognised the subtext - \"surely he can't be functioning without me, I need to confirm this so I know I'm right\".\n\nThankfully my Partner's &lt;other is a sensible, courteous person and has been briefed on the situation, telling her that she saw me recently and that I seemed very happy. I have no idea if NMum will accept this and the pain it causes her, or just assume myself, my Partner and her family are in league against her. \n\nWhich brings me to our next point: my NMum has shown erratic behaviour at the best of times, and during previous disagreements she has often defaulted to \"I wash my hands of you; you do what you like\", with the subtext \"...and come crawling back to me when you inevitably fail without my influence\". \n\nBut Partner and I worry that, having never been given NC before, she may go against her usual pattern and do something big and drastic. That we both know her favourite movie is \"The Godfather\" does not help matters. She has attempted yelling and belittling me in-person, belittling me over email, going to my Partner's former friends for information and now her family. \n\nWe have no idea what she might do now. I have attempted to reassure my Partner that if she pushes at it now (e.g. attempting to just drop in uninvited, continuing to call me, harassing mine or my Partner's loved ones), we can seek remedy via a cease and desist or similar. But we're still both a little wary.\n\nDoes anyone here have a similar experience of being on tenterhooks after initiating NC? Did your Narc eventually do something big, dramatic and horrible? How did you prevent it - or deal with it when it happened?",

I see her now for what she was and I am so torn between loving her still and hating her, my mind is going crazy in circles and I just need to put it out there.\n\nShe doesn't even seem to notice or care what she did to me. She broke up with me for a guy she swore was just a friend. He ghosted her after banging her, so she came back to me for about a week. I took her back because I was extremely vulnerable. At this point I'm  5 years into this relationship and I feel I have no self respect or confidence. Then dude decides to hit her up again, and she fucking ghosts me again. Just like that, like I was just some fucking pit stop for her for the last 5 years.\n\nIm just trying to be positive and keep socializing but fuck its so hard when I know everyone knows what she put me through.. I hadn't seen friends hardly ever when I was with her so now that im around again they look at me like im fucking damaged.\n\nI just want my life back.. I don't even remember who I was before her.

As a teen I started to clue in that something was off but all teenage girls don’t get along with their mom so it was easy to accept as my fault. My mom is the neglectful type. Never emotionally available but always available with a put down.  My dad was a good dad but supported my mom in all her whims. This story really isn’t about what happened then, it is about what happens after.\n\nSo, I grow up and get married. Pretty immediately, I withdrew. I was afraid of the intimacy. I got distant, couldn’t handle having sex and thought everything my husband did was annoying.  He never said a word about it.  This is how unhealthy relationships are born.\n\nWe had a daughter and that is was really clued me into how far from normal my parents were.  I started therapy and began working through a whole series of issues.  I no longer speak to either one of my parents.  I began to feel my life long wall breaking down and I want to connect with my husband, to feel the love that I was never able to before.\n\nFor the past year I’ve tried to build a stronger relationship. But the more I reach out to him the farther away he steps. He isn’t engaged with me, he doesn’t need me to be affectionate toward him and he learned to live with out me.  \n\nLife as been miserable at home the past couple months. There is no trust, resentment and a great sense of unease. Tonight I asked him to stay home and fight with me. To fight for our relationship.  It finally came out that he blames me for those years before therapy. That he learned bad behaviors from that time and doesn’t know how to unlearn them. I think he would leave me, he wants to. I don’t know if he will. It would be easier. \n\nI learned to be a whole person.  It just might have been too late for my marriage. ",

        "text": "To clarify - it's not just the people pleasing in form of doing stuff for others you don't actually want to do. In every interaction, I was nearly solely focussed on the other person, trying to anticipate their mood and expectations and conform to them, making me a bit of a social chameleon. I also tried to be understanding of EVERYthing, and listen to people whenever they wanted to talk about anything.  \nThis lead to a lot of problems for me, mainly exhaustion, but also the feeling that nobody sees me. Which makes sense, since I kept hiding behind that facade of empathetic listening. Which is what it is designed to do - keep myself out of harm's way while it keeps NDad happy since his needs are tended to and on top make it much more unlikely that I ever end up like him.  \n  \nWell, it is now an obsolete coping mechanism turned dysfunctional, and I don't do that anymore (yay for therapy!). So I now get to experience who I am as a person when I'm not trying very hard to be whatever somebody else wants. Which is pretty cool. But I'm not sure I'm very happy with what I see.  \n  \nMy biggest concern is that when I lift the reigns from my mind, I'm being exceedingly critical of other people. Especially at work, where I have some supervisory function in a small team (for the first time) and can get quite snappy when there are (stupid) mistakes made or if someone really doesn't pull their weight. I try to get my point across diplomatically, but the amount of frustration I experience over this is concerning to me sometimes, and I'm pretty sure other people notice.  \n  \nBut it's not just that. I also judge all kinds of other people much more harshly now, and talk about it with others. It just pops into my mind when talking to friends and I tell them my problem with or opinion on someone they often don't even know, and it feels good to vent (and sometimes, when the not-present person's decisions were especially bad, also funny), but then I feel uncomfortable about it. It's an arrogant way to think of people, I can never know all the facts, and I wouldn't say that stuff to their faces. It's not a cool thing to do. And I think I should have learned that some time in middle school.  \n  \nIf I pair that with the facts that I only listen to people's problems now when I feel up to it (and else redirect the conversation or shut it down more or less gently), do not overly focus on the other person walking away happily from an interaction, but rather that I myself do (which for example includes ignoring any non-verbal cues that try to get me to do/ask something I do not want to - some of my friends are NOT good at communication), and that I am more open about my generally rather cynical outlook on life... I'm not so sure that others appreciate being my friend now the same way they did when I was their kind-hearted emotional dumping ground.  \n  \nI just keep wondering - are these normal things and my normalmeter just isn't adjusting very fast, or is this a development towards being disliked by everybody I meet because it makes me a really unpleasant person to be around? I genuinely don't know, because my socialisation was skewed in so many ways that I sometimes feel like I just moved to earth.  \n  \nIf anybody has an opinion or similar experience, I'd love to hear it!

I really helps me a lot with what I'm dealing with and makes me feel like I'm not the only one with these issues. \n\nJust a little background: I have divorced parents. Dad lives one state over, has a wonderful new family and he's an amazing dad. Mom is an Nmom and I grew up in her house and lived there until I was 24. Then moved in with my boyfriend. I have since been one month NC with Nmom and Nsis, but still visit my grandma when I have time who still lives with them.\n\nI am the oldest of three of my Mom's children, we are all girls. I can kind of understand that because my sisters haven't lived with my dad for long (he separated from my mom when I was 9 and they were in diapers) and they only hear Nmom's side of the story, that they side more with her. I find it ridiculous though, because she is clearly still resentful about the whole thing and has taken it out on mostly me, and then a little bit with ES when I left. \n\nThe youngest one has the traits of a narcissist who just turned 19. She's always taking my NMom's side and attacking, insulting and taunting me, putting words in my mouth and judging me for everything.\nThe other one is very quiet, super smart and artistic. She's 20, a model and loves style. We used to not get along in the past but our relationship has greatly improved over the years. She is very quiet about the drama but has expressed to me her frustrations about the family, while at the same time dismissing my past feelings of helplessness and anguish about the situation. She just laughs it off, because she's really good at keeping her emotions bottled up. So I just try not to talk to her about it. \n\nWe both like to thrift and I invited her thrifting tomorrow. She accepted and I'm very happy, but I'm also very nervous. Mostly because of the text conversation we had when we made the plans:\n\n**ME***Let me know if you'd still like to go thrifting on Tuesday. I would pick you up but I just can't go over there anymore. If you'd still want to hang out you'd have to drive over to my place if you wouldn't mind. By the way, you're always welcome and I'll always make sure you have my address. It's just the way it's gonna have to be from now on. If you don't want to I'll understand.*\n\n**ES**: *It's okay. And yes I still want to go thrifting on Tuesday.*\n\n**ME**: *Good. That makes me really happy :)*\n\n**ES**: *No problem :heart emoji: If you don't mind me asking though, why don't you want to come here anymore? I have no problem going over there to see you but I just want to make sure everything is okay.*\n\n**ME**: *Everything is great. I'm just trying not to do things/go places/be around people that stress me out. I just don't want to be in a conflict because I have a lot on my plate. Thank you for asking.*\n\nShe hasn't responded to this. I'm worried that she doesn't want to go anymore. And if she does, I don't know what to say in case she asks for more elaboration.\n\nI just want to be there for my sister if she needs anything. I think it's unfair that my relationship with my other family members has to be screwed up because my Nmom won't stop being bitter. If anyone has any advice, I would love that. \n\n\n",

        "text": "So yesterday I was at work, and was checking my phone. My phone freaks out nowadays, I have to get it replaced. In the middle of a freakout it accidentally made me Facebook call my Nmom on Messenger. I immediately hung up and sent her a message apologizing and saying I didn't mean to call her. I sent her this because I didn't want her to think I needed to talk to her, because it NEVER goes well and I apologized for bothering her because I was just trying to be courteous. But we all know that N's can twist things to make them look a lot more awful than they actually are.\n\nShe then proceeded to send me three messages, they were all the same message, with little edits in each one. The last one read \n\n\"You don't need to apologize. You can avoid such a horrendous mistake if you unfriend me. God forbid you actually were to call me.\" \n\nI could tell she just wanted to beg her to not feel that way and that I'd call her later or something, basically groveling to her and apologizing. It makes her feel really good. I just sat there, looking at the message..then went onto Facebook and deleted her. \n\nIt felt really crappy because I'm used to going back and apologizing and wanting to make amends. I don't want to HAVE to go No Contact, but Nmom and Nsis have really left me no choice. \n\nBut it also felt good because I see in myself the ability to not take the bait thrown at me by the N's and make adjustments to my life that help my emotional growth and wellbeing. \n\nA happy moment yesterday was me reading to my boyfriend the message she sent me while we were laughing, and him saying \"Well, she's got a point!\"  :D",

I wasn't aware that he might be a narc at this point, but he kept talking about other girls all the time, telling me that wherever he goes there's always some girl checking him out and stuff which was really odd. The point which completely pushed me over the edge was when my cat, who I got from him, passed away from illness. we were out, and I was feeling horrible and when I told him I need to talk to him, he made some nasty comment about how he has to spend money to take me somewhere to talk? we had just finished eating at a restaurant and he left saying he needs to go home soon to his mom. when I confronted him about it and told him that was really hurtful his response was that he didn't remember saying that and if I analyze everything he said so much he doesn't know how this will work out.  later I lost interest and told him I don't wanna sleep with him anymore, for which he got angry yelled at me over the phone. told me he wouldn't meet me if I don't meet him in a hotel - which he again denies saying at all and accuses me of thinking such horrible things about him. later wanted to go through my WhatsApp messages, when I said no, he cut the call and refused to talk to me until I let him see - later apologized saying his mind wasn't in the right place so he didn't know why he did that. This is around the time I came across narcissism but I feel like I'm overthinking. I finally decided to stop talking to him, and this is the last conversation we had after i told him i don't wanna talk to him anymore and blocked him  (https://iris927.imgur.com/all/#2)- I don't know how to go about this anymore, I'm legit scared at this point. please help!",

Even if he does to some extent, he is keeping a compassionate stance for my Nrents.

It could be to do with unresolved issues from his own upbringing too. \n\nDid you have experience with changing your doctor, because continuing to visit the family doctor was bringing it's own issues on top of everything else?

        "text": "I recently wrote a little blurb on here, and some extremely kind people came forward and gave me the shove of encouragement I needed to be more open about my abusive past. I think writing it out and putting it into the universe might help me feel some closure. \n\nBeing raised by a narcissist led me to date a narcissist from the ages of 18-21. Near the end of the relationship was the only time I was ever physically abused. It was Saturday, Nov 11 2007. My sister had rented the upper lounge area of a bar for her 20th (I think) birthday party. It was the first time that my boyfriend (31) of three years had agreed to meet my family. All they knew about him was that I’d been on an emotional rollercoaster for the entire time I was with him, they had mixed feelings.\n\nI watched his son all day at my parent’s (they’re first time meeting him), while he was supposed to be at work (I later found out he was at home drinking).  He showed up drunk but was super friendly with everyone and was acting like the perfect boyfriend, so I let it go.  Everyone seemed to like him, my mom said it was the happiest she’d seen me awhile. We put his son to sleep in my bed, and he continued to drink heavily while I sipped wine.\n\nI should be clear, for three years this guy had isolated me from everything, I was basically living with him at that point and he threw a fit every time I wanted to go sleep at home. He thought I knew no one and had no friends anymore. He had spent three years telling me that I was nothing and no one else would want me. The stress of the relationship had caused me to lose a lot of weight. \n\nWhen we arrived at my sister’s birthday party it was basically a high school reunion.  Her and I are only a year apart in age, and still lived in our hometown where a lot of our old friends were still living and going to college. My sister was prom queen. I got made fun of for being fat, but again, had lost a lot of weight. \n\nThere were many people there that came up to me that night and wanted to say hi or that I looked great (guys and girls). I was surprised, he was absolutely enraged. I remember going to the bar to get us a drink and seeing him duck out the exit. I grabbed our jackets and went after him. \n\nI found him outside trying to get a cab. I asked him to come back inside, what was wrong, it had been going so well. He said I’d embarrassed him and he was going home.  At one point he kind of bumped into me and I fell backwards when my heel got caught in a grate. He started to walk away and I got up, put my shoe back on and followed him. \n\nI know now that I should have just stayed where I was. My family wasn’t great, but at that point in time we were all trying and I should have stayed. My following him kind of re-imploded my family for a while. I definitely take the blame for that.\n\nHe finally found a cab and got into the front seat, I got in the back. He cursed at me all the way back to his place; I apologized to the cab driver when we got out. \n\nWhen we got inside it was around 1am and I tried to reason with him. I begged him not to ruin an awesome night. I told him he was drunk, why not just go to sleep and talk about it in the morning. After I said that I went upstairs to get ready for bed hoping he’d follow suit. He had a roommate, who was home and sleeping.\n\nHe followed me upstairs and continued calling me, really any horrible thing you can think of, the one I remember is “worthless c**t.” He screamed at me from the hallway until I walked over and shut the door. There was no lock on this door, it was just shut. I sat down on the bed and the next thing I knew the door, including the door frame, came crashing down in front of me. \n\nHe turned and went down the stairs and I ran after him, crying, screaming why did you do that? When I got to the bottom of the stairs he turned around so that we were eye to eye and started telling me to hit him. He was literally spitting, whispering for me to hit him. \n\nThe phone was right behind him (I didn’t have a cell at that time). When I moved to pass him, he grabbed my arm and twisted it behind my back, pushing me into the living room. He dropped me to the floor with my arm behind my back and put his knee on my arm, while he pushed my face into the carpet, screaming at me to calm down. \n\nI fought him off and slipped out onto the balcony where he locked the door behind me. He was screaming at me through the sliding glass door that we were done, and started walking around with a garbage bag throwing anything that belonged to me in it. I was realizing at that time I could be in a lot of trouble. I was trapped on a balcony, with a ravine behind me, and a psychopath in front of me.  \n\nI begged him to give me the phone; that I would call a cab and go home and I’d leave him alone forever. I don’t know how long I was out there. I know he went upstairs a few times and I was starting to get scared he would pass out and I’d be there all night. Finally I saw him come back downstairs and grab the phone. He said he would pass it to me.\n\nHe opened the door a crack and I grabbed the phone with one hand and slid my knee into the door trying to push it open (I panicked; I really thought he would pass out and forget me, or that he had taken the batteries out of the phone).  He slammed the sliding glass door as hard as he could on my kneecap three times. \n\nI fell backwards and started screaming. He went upstairs and I called my mom. She told me she was coming. I was laying there crying when I heard the door unlock and he picked me up and carried me inside to the couch where he started to tell me how sorry he was.\n At that exact moment his roommate comes downstairs and asks what the hell is going on. That I should go home. I told him I already called my mom.  I grabbed the garbage bag and limped out of the house to where my mom was waiting in her car. I think if she knew what was going on in the house she wouldn’t have waited in the car.\n\nI don’t remember much about going home; I know I slept in the guest room. I remember the next morning my mom brought me to take his son home (who was 6, and could totally sense something horrible was wrong), before she took me to the emergency to get my knee looked at (bruises were starting to form).\n\nMy brother and sister found out what happened the next day, I’m not sure how or when my father found out.\n\nI never pressed charges; I loved his kid too much. That was in November. It unfortunately wasn’t the last straw, but I did seek counselling at the college I was attending. There were no more physical altercations, but I became aware enough with the help of therapy to understand he was mentally, emotionally and verbally abusing me. I had cut all off all contact by June 2008. It’s going to be ten years soon.\n\nI’m only now starting to actually get over it.\n",

She made accounts on social media and harassed me with pleading, emotionally manipulative messages. I block them every time, but then she started trying to get information about me from my friends. They know to block and ignore as well, and things have been pretty quiet on that front the past year (especially since I also cut out my abusive dad and stepmother), but the latest breach has really freaked me out. \n\nI don’t really use Twitter, but I still have an account there. Today I checked it just in passing, and found a tweet from NM, saying my grandfather (her dad) had died. This man sexually abused me as a child, so I feel no sorrow at all from his death, but NM thought it would be a good idea to attach 3 photos of his corpse to the tweet. I’m still stunned. It was ghoulish. I honestly don’t know what to make of that. I did my usual blocking and recalibrating my privacy settings, but I’m still feeling shaken up. \n\nOn one hand, I can only feel glad that one of my worst abusers is dead, but on the other, being shown the corpse (corpses really freak me out) feels like it has robbed me of the peace I should have felt. \n\nOn top of that, I can reasonably assume she’s seen that I have changed my name and the tweet I made to promote a play I’m in during the summer, and now I’m afraid she’ll find where I live or turn up to the show and make trouble (either by making a scene or just making me too anxious to perform properly). I can’t have her anywhere near me, and contact like this has a kind of proximity that sets off so much anxiety and hypervigilance. \n\nI’m going to contact Equity about what my rights are if she does turn up to a performance and harasses me, and send a reminder to my friends not to give her any info and to block her if she bugs them. But I don’t know how to make myself feel safe right now, or how to stop those corpse pictures from constantly swimming behind my eyes and making me feel haunted. ",

        "text": "Hello all. I've very recently suffered an ongoing series of episodes with my mother which have led me - along with episodes in my childhood and adulthood that have been abusive - to the conclusion that she is a NMum; and that my sister, who patterns herself on my mother, is a NSis as a result. I have now taken steps to cut off contact with them on a temp, and then perhaps perm, basis for the good of my mental health.\n\nThis is in no small part due to my Partner, who has (thank heavens) upset the delicate balance of our family - without an outsider POV, we could continue behaving as though everything was normal and healthy (NMum has accused me of \"causing problems and then trying to fix them\", as she cannot fathom said problems ever originating with her); and without someone who loves and encourages me unconditionally (as my Partner does), I could continue being humiliated and made the servant of my NMum's whims, re: my career, clothing, hairstyle, behaviour, ambitions.\n\nThe problem I face now is: Partner &amp; I are slightly alarmed about the near future. Both NMum and NSis refuse to just be cut out and have continued to attempt to communicate with me in the hopes that they can end my \"sh*tty rebellious streak\" (Nsis) and get me back in line. As both of them have been erratic in the past, we worry that they will take further steps - like coming to our house unexpectedly (NMum has done this once already), or spreading hurtful rumours about Partner (NSis works at Partner's old workplace). I'm still not sure how to definitively set boundaries with these two - and EDad - without breaking silence, which I want to maintain so that neither of them can hurt us directly. Luckily, both of them are due to move away within the next 6 months or so - but we're not sure we can wait that long. Is there any way I can just tell them to back off?\n\nThe other problem is - I have two younger sisters, 17 and 19, who are somewhat innocent to all this. As one of them is at Uni and the other lives with NMum, they have only heard her side of the story; and whether they believe it or not, they are probably quite angry at this disruption to their lives. I want to keep contact with them as I love them both, but I'm unsure of how I can get in touch without it being fed back to NMum and NSis - who will accuse me of \"poisoning them against [us]\", as they have before. \n\nI don't want to talk about who's right or wrong or tell my side - I just want my sisters to know I still love them and want to be in their lives (while keeping NMum and Nsis out of it). Any advice on how to approach either of them in a neutral, confidential way?",

My half-brother and half-sister are angels. And my dad is happy and his wife is awesome. \n\nBut my NMom? Bitter after 16 going on 17 YEARS OF DIVORCE from my Dad. Still hasn't gotten over the fact that the relationship didn't work out THE SECOND TIME. Since the separation, has done everything in her power to turn us against our father. Because it's totally normal to try to destroy the relationship with a man and his children when your romantic relationship doesn't work out. It was very hard because I consider myself a Dad's Girl. I still AM. Even after all the damage and abuse, all the things I was compelled to say, me and my Dad made amends and have an awesome, supportive relationship.\n\nI haven't talked to my NMom in about a month now, haven't felt better. I did go to her house on my day off yesterday while she was at work to visit Grandma and the dog. The closer I drove to the house, the tighter the knot in my stomach. While I was approaching the door, Nsis came out, I said \"hi\" instinctively and she sneered at me. No worries. I really don't care at this point. Too many years of being disrespected and sh*t on. After having a nice convo with Grandma, walked right by Nsis out the door and didn't say a word.\n\nYou're not getting a birthday wish from me. Let me know when you're done getting brainwashed. ",

No more contact with my parents and brother at the moment. \n\nShe has one brother and one sister, with whom I belong well, but I see the abuse they lived before or some narcissistic traits in them, and it hurts me because it pulls them closer to my Nmom’s behavior. They stopped having contact with her a few months ago, because of Nmom’s destructive behavior.\nMy cousins are the same, they don’t really got the “family value”, and if they do, it is exacerbated (narcissistic). \nFrom my Edad side, being an only child, there are no aunts/uncles/cousins. It is a way healthier family, having arguments sometimes, but then quickly forgotten, they laugh easily... they just enjoy life as we should do. \n\nI have a GC brother, who seems to have BPD, he is quite aggressive when things don’t go his way, can be violent, wish for revenge... he is very nice, but has been rotten by my Nmom. \n\nIt is always hard to know how to react in family situations (such as with my in laws), and I am always afraid not to have the good, genuine reaction. For example, I hate to be hugged if not warned, but I cannot reject people who love me, so I just remain straight like a pole, and begin to sweat, become red... \n\nI also sometimes wish I had a sibbling to exchange with, someone who I feel is really concerned by me, who I could say everything to. I do have friends, very close ones even, but I always feel a distance. \nFortunately, my SO is very understanding, and I could not be happier with him, though I always have a small voice at the back of my head saying: \n\n*if tomorrow is the end of the world, nobody will choose you to spend his/her lasts moments with, even SO will go by his family*\n\nThat makes me sad that I missed that family connection.\nSometimes I think it is my inner self rejecting people who love me, because “I don’t deserve them”. Or that my body also has its language saying “don’t hang out with me, I don’t worth it”. ",

        "text": "My Ndad was freakishly OCD about his photos. He would number them and also caption them on the back of each. If you were looking at them, they HAD TO STAY IN ORDER or he'd freak out and start a rampage. He'd also make about a zillion copies and sit there and number each one and caption each one and send them out to all of the family members. Then, he'd call each of us and ask if we looked at them and read all the captions. Ndad had major control issues.\n\nSo, one time - this was about 24 years ago, prior to going NC - he sent me this packet of pictures in the mail, and because I knew I'd be quizzed later on the info, I looked at all of them and read them. I also secretly (because they're mine, and he's not around to watch) fucked up the numerical order of them on purpose. I know, a bit immature, but it felt pretty good. I was still in my 30s. :-)\n\nNow,  little back story. My partner of that time and I had bought some land. And even though I was the \"wimp\" of the entire family because I didn't enjoy hunting, I was still very outdoorsy. So, we wanted to build a little cabin there and did so, just a small primitive log cabin. We did the whole pioneer thing, chopped down the trees, notched the logs, everything. It turned out pretty well. We were the proudest two guys in the world. And everyone in my family except my mom? Totally zero reaction. I mean, this is like the thing that EVERYONE used to talk about when we were kids, buying land and building a cabin, but nobody ever does it, right? \n\nMe, the little wimp? I actually accomplished it. \n\n(there's more to this story, which I'll do another post later on).\n\nAt one point, I allowed them to hunt there, both Nsister and Ndad. It was a huge mistake on my part, they both not only didn't lock my gate, but they also left the front door standing open on the cabin. Yeah, I was pissed about the lack of respect for my property. Sorry, no more hunting for them after that.\n\nSo, one day, not to long after it was built, a large portion of the family (Nsister, her two kids, Emom and Ndad) visit the place with me. My mom is beaming and tells me how proud she is and how much she likes it. Ndad has nothing good to say, barely acknowledges what I did, Nsister, about the same. Whatever, I'm used to their bullshit by now, I was just happy to be there with my mom. And Ndad is taking pictures, all over the place because he's that annoying guy with the camera.\n\nSo, later, when this packet of pictures arrives, I notice that there are a lot of pictures of everyone else, but only one of me. Naturally. In the ONE picture that features me, I am standing in front of the cabin.\n\nNdad's caption on the back?\n\n\"Here is a place in (State) that Ndaughter and I went hunting once\".\n\nSeriously.\nNo mention of me, the guy in the picture! \nNo mention of the cabin I built, which is right behind me! \n\nI just shook my head and wondered WTF was wrong with people. It took me a while to get over it. At first I wanted to just throw them all away, but there were pics of my Emom there and I thought better of it.\n\nSo, a few days later, I took a sharpie and crossed out his caption and rewrote history:\n\n\"Here is a picture of my son [name] in front of the cabin that he and his partner [name] built. I am very amazed and proud of both of them.\"\n\nAnd people wonder why I didn't go to his funeral.\n\n",

I talked to the company and they're not unkind, but I feel like I'll get stuck with this dress and it makes me sad.\n\nI keep thinking about how I know nothing about wedding dresses, measurements and any of it, and how my Nmom was actually a good seamstress. She would have known what measurements to send, what to do with my dress now, just the whole thing.\n\nExcept that my mom would have hated my dress because it wasn't her choice, she'd give the wrong sizes because of it, and when the dress came back wrong tell me that she was right and I should've gone with her suggestion. She only wants the best, but I never listen. \n\nOverall, I am usually relieved that we're not in touch anymore but days like this I feel angry that I didn't have a mom who actually cared about me. Instead, I had a mom who only cared about herself to the point where she'd make everyone around her unsafe and miserable, including her own kid. \n\nDarn you for being a bad parent when I was younger and never being around, and darn you for making me miss out on having a parent during such an important time in my life.",

I mean they don't know that my dad tried to stab me with a knife in 2008, my brother threatened me with a weapon in 2014 or that my mom is a covert narcissist who only cares about herself. Not that these are excuses, but I just don't know how to deal with it. Can you please help?\n\nOn one hand, I am sick of living at home with my mom ( had to move back in few years ago when my dad passed away) . It was the worst decision of my life since they both ( yes my brother also lives at home) started narcissisticaly abusing me.\n\nI just need a job so I can leave. But I just hope I don't get in a self-sabotage mode and destroy my own life.",

You just don't want them to be able to form an opinion about something you're doing.\n\nI am a very conflict-driven person...

There are a handful of other people at my current job who are also looking for new positions so I've thankfully had a few people to talk to about the whole process. I've been really grateful for that because my current position was my first job out of undergrad and I was offered it because of a previous internship so I haven't really ever done the whole job search thing.\n\nHowever, the biggest difference I've noticed is just how much more comfortable they all feel with their situations. Like they all have family members who would let them live rent-free or even provide financial support if needed during the transition period. Hell most of them have MULTIPLE family members who would do so.\n\nMeanwhile I'm over here with maybe just barely enough money saved up to actually make this work and MAYBE about a month's worth of savings for if shit hit the fan and I had to quit before finding something new. Like I'm used to needing to support myself by now but it is just so depressing knowing I have to make myself keep coming to this job and can't afford to just quit it and focus on finding the next thing. Not that I would necessarily, just that I'm bitter its not even an option. \n\nI don't have a single person I could ask for more than maybe about $100. Having just a few thousand extra would make me feel so much more secure so I've considered (briefly) trying to set up some kind of GoFundMe or something. But also I know I'm better off than others because I do have this job and I feel like that means I'm well enough off that I should be donating to fundraisers to help people not creating one myself.\n\nEdit to clarify that I'm not looking for help or pity or advice.

I didn't talk to my father until I was 18 (due to a slew of issues surrounding my mother). When I was 19 I started the much needed no contact with my NMom, and life began to pick up for me. I was in college, in a relationship and started a new life for myself, free of the stress my mother would inflict on me. However, there was always something looming over me. My relationship with my father and immediate family. \n\nMy father has another family, his first wife to be exact, before he met my mom. Before having me, he had children with his first wife; that makes them my step/half sisters to be exact. They divorced, and he met and married my mom. We all grew up a bit together when I was younger, but I stopped seeing them when my mom, dad and I moved to another state. After my parent's divorce he moved back and married his first wife again. Today, my immediate family all live in the same area. They are always together for holidays, birthdays, big events, weekends, and vacations. Me, being so far away, oftentimes feel left out. I visit as much as I can (about once or twice a year). I send cards, FaceBook messages, call, and Skype them as much as I can, but it doesn't feel reciprocated. For example, no one called me for Easter, even though I messaged them. No one has been to visit me, as they say the flights are too expensive and that there are more of them and one of me, so it's easier for me to fly to them. Last Christmas, I told my dad I feel left out whenever I am with them. It's as if life has gone on without me for too long, that it feels hard for me to join in. He told me that I basically need to get over it, and work toward feeling included now. My step mom has told me that I am sorta our of sight out of mind, and that it's not a bad thing but they have busy lives. \n\nI'm not sure how to start feeling included? It's been 10 years since I've been reintroduced in my immediate families' life. At what point do I start to feel included? I'm feeling like this has a lot to do with growing up with an NMom. I have a need to feel loved and included. I've gone to therapy for years to help overcome this, but every time I make progress, something sets me back. I was wondering if any one had some kind words they could throw my way in helping deal with this?\n\nTL;DNR - I'm struggling to feel loved and included by my estranged father and immediate family post breakaway from NMom. It's been 10 years since I've been reintroduced with him and I still don't feel included. ",

        "text": "Let's talk about Sex.\n\nNo, but seriously, no one ever talks about this stuff and I think it's kind of ridiculous. We're all adults.\n\nI've been pretty open on here, and various other forums about my mental health and how psychiatrist medications have pretty much saved my life and my relationship. I'm also and have been in ongoing therapy for a colorful amount of other issues pertaining to long term traumas.\n\nWithout going into to much detail about my own personal sex life (I don't want to to discuss it without my partners consent out of respect), Psychiatrist meds have some unpleasant side effects. Low libido and harder to orgasm, just to name a few.\n\nBecause of this, I was beating myself up about my low libido a lot, blaming my medications and  thinking there wasn't much i could about it. I can't go off my medications, I NEED them, so i felt stuck and hopeless.\n\nBut here lately, I've been working on being brutally honest with myself, and I have a come to jesus talk with myself and about my sexuality. No, this isn't me coming out as gay, I've always been bisexual. This isn't a new development.\n\nI've always been a rather sexual creature. Not in the terms of having sex with everybody, but very aware and curious about sex, and genitalia, and exploring sexuality fluidly, without judgement. I've been with both men and women equally, and I believe that's how sexuality should be explored. Freely and without judgement. But as I've gotten older, I've gotten more closed off, and really gotten away from the foundation i laid for myself 10-12 years ago (I'm 31 you do the math). This realization really made me take pause and try and figure out why I've changed. And this is where things got interesting.\n\nI've been traumatized, a lot, by several people. Between 21 to now, I've been hurt a lot. Some of it soul crushingly sad. Like move away to a new city level of soul crushing. I've been working through these trauma's in therapy, but what I haven't worked on and what I didn't expect is these trauma's effect on my sex life and my sexuality as a whole.\n\nBeing fluid about sex and sexuality requires a level of vulnerability and trust that I have subsequently lost by being betrayed, cheated on, abandoned, and left by previous lovers. Each time someone broke my heart into a thousand fragments, I stopped trusting as much, i stopped being vulnerable. I stopped trying.\n\nThis has led me the realization that I am far more closed off to my current lover than I ever realized. I would like to note, my relationship is strong and healthy and we are both very happy. But I realized, through this journey, that I am like a gear shift. Without realizing it I have been stuck in one gear for the last 4 years, and it's been great. But now I realize I'm holding back. And I'm holding back because I am afraid if I am as open, trusting, and vulnerable as I WANT to be, as I know I CAN be, that he will leave (abandonment issues are a huge issue with me that I've been working on for 2 years, this is another layer to them).\n\nSo now, in addition to my regular therapist, I am seeking a Sexologist. A therapist that specializes in sexuality, and sex issues, and issues related around trust and sex. The search hasn't been fruitful yet, but I am still trying. Even writing this now, and being open with it, is a huge step for me in my vulnerability training. It's a step for me in the right direction.\n\nDon't be afraid to talk about sex. Your sex life, or sexual hangups you have. It might just be the missing piece you've been looking for in whatever you're going through.",

        "text": "I cut off contact just about 6 months ago.  \n\nMy narcissist is related to me through my spouse.  I have a narc mother that I worked really hard to cut out of my life and it really consumed most of my time.  So much so, I couldn't see the other narc hiding in the trees.  \n\nMy spouse's sibling was always rude to me.  Little snotty comments here, snotty comments there.  And true to form, I always made up excuses for the behaviour.  They would pour on the charm at family functions - I always had anxiety before them and my spouse would be like \"it'll be fine, just come\".  \n\nBut then, my spouse's parent passes.  The surviving parent can't cope and gets a new \"life partner\".  My spouse's sibling - full on bat-shit crazy.  Surviving parent is just AWOL.  We've slowly reintegrated contact with the surviving parent - the partner that they have chosen is actually really good to them.  \n\nSpouse's sibling?  Just...hurtful.  Everything is about them.  They made sure to go through their deceased parents stuff first...and alone.  Their kids got to go through all the deceased parent's stuff first and alone.  \n\nIn my culture - we just don't do that.  Their stuff is packed up for a year so that you have a chance to grieve, and then at the anniversary, you get to go through it as a family.  The elders of your family, like their surviving spouse or siblings or both, can give out what things they like.  You go through it together, as a family.  \n\nIt just didn't happen like that.  It was really hard to not get offended by it - or feel left out.  My spouse and I have children, and one of our kids was really close to the deceased parent.  I feel strongly for this child - it has been hard for them this year.  \n\nToday, I woke up, and I just feel sorry for this ugly narc sibling.  Like - as much as the actions that they have taken toward me and my spouse this year - I just feel sorry for them.  My spouse unknowingly greyrocked them the other day- and I kind of laughed.  My spouse isn't and wasn't as familiar with narcissists before, and only through the last few months we've even been able to put a label on what these actions are.  \n\nThere are times I am pretty disgusted by their actions - but I'm glad that I've gone NC with them because...I've been able to just ... cope...with what has happened.  I've got my own kids, and so we've been able to deal with the loss and all of the changes that have happened since then.  \n\nI only just feel sorry for my narc sibling-in-law.  It blows my mind that they are so good at the long-con - but really.  It just takes one healthy, balanced person in your life to help you realise how gross your old life was.  It still takes some counselling from time...the pain is still hurts from time to time...but.  I feel like this is a milestone.  I'm super glad that this time I was able to recognize it sooner and faster and easier than I did when I was dealing with my n-mom.  I'm glad I was able to save some of this pain - and some of the pain I recognize it as baiting.   ",

I’ve been successful at distancing myself from actual narcissists (save a round with an nboss but that’s basically over), but I find myself going through periods where I’ll obsessively read or watch YouTube videos about them.\n\nMaybe it’s an avoidance tactic for living life to the fullest. Like maybe I should literally get a hobby. I’m trying to grow a garden right now. I just bought a digital piano. When I feel the urge to learn more about narcissism, maybe I’ll watch a video about keeping squirrels out of my raised beds or how to play the theme song for Somewhere in Time.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like they compulsively study narcissism? \n\nEDIT: I want to make sure to clarify that I understand studying narcissism is an important phase for healing from nabuse and I’m not judging anyone for that. I am probably judging myself a little, and I’m working on being kinder to myself instead. I also do feel like at this point I am not gaining as much from studying narcissism and am ready for a new phase. I really appreciate all the comments and the suggestions. :)",

I can say that i've recovered and will not be tolerating any hoovering attempts, but there is some regret that i spent so much time on it. Has anyone else ever felt this way?",

I have no idea where she gets these thoughts from.\" \n\nHe genuinely doesn't understand that he's fucking with her head. He believes that because he's told her that he doesn't want to be her partner, that every action of hers from this point isn't his responsibility or problem.\n\nIt's *fascinating* seeing this kind of garbage behaviour from the outside. He's sending her totally mixed messages but she's so blinded by her obsession for him that she's not willing to see beyond the selfish actions on his part.\n\nWhy would he stop seeing her if:\n\n - She allows him to sleep with her\n\n - She cleans the house\n\n - She's always available to him whenever he asks\n\nYuck.",

The more I write, the more I remember and the holes disappear. But aside from finding more memories, most of which are negative, I start to realize that even memories I considered neutral are off.\n\n- One of these memories is me playing outside by myself. A car sped up in the background and startled me, resulting in me falling into a pair of scissors as I ran away. The scissors missed my eye only barely, and I cried and called out for help. A neighbour ran out and took me in, taking care of the wound (and me) while she called an ambulance. My mom wasn't home. I can vaguely remember her saying she had to leave for a little while and to play outside, and knock on the neighbours door if I needed anything. I still have the scar, which my mother claims was the doctors fault (he tore the bandage off too quickly after it was stitched perfectly). I was 6-7. \n\n\n- The second memory is one I told in passing. I was around 8 when my mom would give me grocery lists and money to get the household shopping. The store was about 10-15min walk away and I went by myself. She'd get angry if I forget anything or if I got the wrong thing on the list. One time she wrote potatoes and I walked back to ask her which kind (to make sure she wouldn't be angry). My mom was on the phone, turned around and slapped me across the face. She got angry and told me not to interrupt her when she was on the phone. I don't think she ever apologised for it, and instead berated me for being so petty to remember it. I've always known she was wrong for slapping me, but my therapist pointed out that letting an 8-year old do the household shopping was just as wrong. That part had always been normal to me. \n\n\n- A dog chased me when I was 8-9, and I sat in a tree for hours waiting for it to go away. My mom never came to check on me. \n\n\n- I was abused by a neighbour when I was 6. My mom said she checked on me every 30 minutes if I was outside, and due to something she was going through, she or a family member didn't check as often as the 30 minutes she used to. Now that I am thinking of kids, I can't imagine leaving my 6 year old outside, unattended, even for 30 mins. \n\n\nSo I am now starting to realise that my mom was actually a pretty neglecting parent...",
