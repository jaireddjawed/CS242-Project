How have subreddits used them, what are the pros and cons, how did it play out, and how did communities react?\n\nI'm already paying attention to r/science, r/worldnews, r/politics, r/books, r/AskReddit. I've also looked a bit at the history of [AutoStickyBot](https://www.reddit.com/r/modclub/comments/3tnav5/introducing_autostickybot_for_easy_comment/) from before the platform added sticky comment features. Are there other subreddits, large or small, that I should look at or talk to?",

        "text": "It's no secret that marketing gurus have for some time been manipulating vote counts with disposable accounts to make their messages more visible and the messages of their critics/competitors less visible. The savvy user may want for there to be an easier way to invert a conversation thread than by scrolling all the way to the bottom and loading the next 100 messages over and over. Right now, messages can be sorted by \"best\", \"top\", \"new\", \"old\", \"controversial\", and \"q&amp;a\". Controversial, to my understanding, sorts with consideration for total vote count (upvotes and downvotes) and some respect to the post's age. This is close to what I want, but comments that get buried quickly would get a few downvotes, yet not a significant number of upvotes in most cases to cause them to appear high in \"contrversial\" sorts. The best way to view low-vote count posts would be to simply add a \"bottom\" sort option.\n\nThe default sort setting can still be by \"top\" (unless changed in RES), but I would personally sometimes like to see what's unpopular or purposefully buried. I understand that downvotes are meant to act as a punishment for violating reddiquette (if such a thing ever really existed), but if we're going to be honest with ourselves, let's recognize that that simply isn't how it's used most of the time, and the users need a way to quickly and conveniently access the information that they're entitled to, even information that some people don't want to be seen (unless it violates the TOS in some way, obviously).\n\nIf there already exists a way to do this or if I got anything wrong, please tell me.",

But their comment score was at almost six *thousand* points.\n\nI'm simply curious about this discrepancy between their apparent score and what their actual comments garnered. If someone posts in a sub I've blocked/Reddit has \"quarantined\" or whatever they call it, would that account for this? I suppose they could have *deleted* all the comments that made the karma?\n\nThe weird part is that I just noticed that that commenter got a cryptic, in-jokey response from someone in exactly the same boat: years-old account, maybe half a dozen comments, score *way* out of proportion.\n\nWhat gives?\n\n(Oh and no, asking them directly is absolutely out of the question.

Then they made it so that pictures no longer show up correctly in the mobile web version.  They fit poorly to the page or don't show up at all.  And to view gifs i now have to click through to imgur.

How is this not considered spam and the users removed from the site? I can get banned if I link my hobby non-monetized youtube channel too many times, but with these accounts literally every post is self promotion to drive their sales.\n\n2. If it is allowed, shouldn't the site be doing something to verify the sellers? I've purchased custom pics or camshows before from other sites but the sites themselves verify all the sellers beforehand. They all have their 18 U.S.C. 2257 and 2257A Record-Keeping Requirements Compliance Statement online.\n\nI'm just curious as more and more of the NSFW subs are becoming dominated by these sellers if there shouldn't be some way for people to know for sure they account actually belongs to the person in the pics and that they are of legal age to be doing so.",

How /r/Gamingcirclejerk differs from other popular gaming subreddits is the circlejerking subjects (basically turned upside down). False information is accepted and highly upvoted as long it is anti-PC or pro-console, facts in turn get heavily downvoted when they don't line with the circlejerk. Common circlejerking themes there, I counter the circlejerk real quick:\n\n* \"PC gamers pirate all games\"/\"piracy is wrong\", \"gaming is a privilege and not a right\" - I have pirated hundreds of games and I will continue to do so, but I also have purchased over 500 titles on Steam, GOG, Origin Uplay and from brick and mortar stores (I principally pirate because of DRM). As a torrent uploader I want to share with others and I donate hundreds of dollars to charity and free software projects each year. Without \"piracy\" hundreds of games would have been lost forever after being pulled from sale. I have nothing against people who \"pirate\" everything  they can, though, but so far I've met few such individuals.  \n* \"the majority of games are console-exclusives because of PC piracy\" - the majority of console exclusives are exclusive to one console (manufacturer), multiplatform console-exclusive games are few and far between with the exception of EA sport franchises   \n* \"Consoles get the best games\" - PC has exclusive genres (real-time strategy, grand strategy, point and click to some degree), \"but it doesn't matter because I don't play them\"\n* \"I hate [some valued game such as Fallout New Vegas or Witcher 3], [a mainstream game by a large publisher, like Watch Dogs 2 or the latest Call of Duty] is incredible\n* \"there is no difference between console and PC game prices\" - are there [100% percent charity bundles](https://web.archive.org/web/20170213195347/https://www.humblebundle.com/freedom) and [free games](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/search?q=free&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all) on console?  \n* \"the console manufacturers must charge for online play because there are so much more people playing than on PC\" - 50€/$ yearly fee + console (most people have a computer) + few free to play games attracts more people than a [gratuitous service](http://store.steampowered.com/stats/)?\n* \"emulators are poor and never can reach a console-level experience\" - consoles also emulate past-generation games and compatibility isn't perfect\n* \"Hopefully Denuvo will kill off piracy\" - [Microsoft's UWP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform) is never mentioned even though it isn't cracked yet, and perhaps never will be because the architecture is rooted in Windows\n\n/r/Gamingcirclejerk/ is filled with misinformation, unconscious circlejerking and is an antithesis to /r/pcmasterrace, but without [comprehensive arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide).

        "text": "Some subreddits openly support (or oppose) a certain cause or idea.\n\n/r/KotakuInAction\n\n/r/ShitRedditSays\n\n/r/circlebroke\n\nThese subreddits operate in a totalitarian manner: they cater to specific ideologies, and comments opposing the central ideology are deleted. But since the goal of the community is clearly defined, I don't think anyone would be surprised if, for instance, you posted a pro-feminist article to /r/TheRedPill and the mods removed it.\n\nOther subreddits are less restrictive when it comes to the scope of the discussion, even though there is no ambiguity over the agenda of the group. For example, you may be able to post an opposing view in /r/Libertarian, and while it may not get deleted, it'll be downvoted to essentially invisibility, simply because you're outnumbered.\n\nThen there are 'neutral' subreddits. Some are neutral by intent:\n\n/r/CapitalismVSocialism\n\n/r/NeutralPolitics\n\n/r/TruePolitics\n\nThese kinds of subreddits exist because of an awareness of conflicting ideas within a field, so they can be considered an attempt to create a platform to discuss these ideas free of moderator bias.\n\nOthers are neutral simply by nature:\n\n/r/philosophy\n\n/r/science\n\n/r/technology\n\nThese are seemingly non-biased because there is no inherent agenda. If you were to judge them by their description, you would expect that any censorship is consistent, i.e. regardless of whether an idea is left or right, pro-x or anti-x, the content is moderated based on the arguments it makes.\n\nHere is the problem: a subreddit that is supposedly neutral has a hidden agenda. Moderators push this agenda through inconsistent censorship and authoritarian practices, rather than by stating their intentions. The false appearance of neutrality gains them many subscribers, but because it's false, the content is essentially propaganda.\n\nTake /r/politics. A person coming to Reddit for the first time might visit /r/politics under the impression that it's simply a political news aggregator, but there is actually a strong bias: [literally every submission](https://i.imgur.com/nY2hG0h.png) on the front page is anti-Trump. This is not the case with /r/the_donald, which makes no attempt to disguise itself as anything other than a pro-Trump group. If the front page of /r/EnoughTrumpSpam looked like that of /r/politics I doubt anybody would complain about censorship, but a default subreddit with no apparent affiliation? Of course /r/politics is not the only subreddit to have been compromised, it's just a well known case.\n\nThe problem is not free speech, it's deception. If we are to have a fair debate and try to arrive at a useful conclusion on any topic, it's better to have segregated communities which represent different sides, or truly impartial ones for an actual discourse, rather than deceitful tactics of feigning neutrality for an ulterior motive.\n\nTo claim reddit supports free speech would disingenuous when the default subreddits, which one would assume are politically moderate, are controlled by a group of people with their own objectives. Since subreddits are claimed on a first-come-first-served basis, it would be hard to turn things around now that common words like /r/news and /r/politics have been taken, but it's still possible to expose fraud when it's rampant.\n\nWhat I've done is tried to replace all the default subreddits with more neutral ones for a better browsing experience. I hope more people realize that there are better communities out there and that these become more popular, and eventually, through good content and moderation, replace the current defaults.",

        "text": "The word \"shitty,\" in every day life, is a straight insult. It suggests a low-effort, low-yield mediocrity - something utterly worthless.\n\nBut on the internet, and on reddit specifically, it comes close to meaning the exact opposite. It's a tough word to define, but here is my attempt:\n\n&gt;**shitty**: funny and almost sublime in its intentional and calculated awfulness.\n\nThe most recent example is the AMA with [Simone Giertz, self-proclaimed Queen of Shitty Robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5xbdu8/im_simone_giertz_selfproclaimed_queen_of_shitty/) - see, for example, [the makeup robot](http://68.media.tumblr.com/0edb94f9af15e9e0cb6e9de3e6ce58d5/tumblr_o238zvawbT1qlnszno1_500.gif). Her robots are bad, in that they're utterly terrible at the task they claim to accomplish, but they're also very impressive in their design and construction. And what's perhaps most impressive about them is the amount of time and work that was put in, in order to make something so bad at its supposed task.\n\nI also think of /r/ShittyAskScience. When that subreddit is at its best, the questions are stunning in their clever awfulness. Take the question [\"The first dog in space died of stress. Was that because of all the vacuums up there?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/4tbcsw/the_first_dog_in_space_died_of_stress_was_that/), for example. In order for someone to organically come up with that question, they would require layers of specific knowledge (e.g. \"dogs don't like vacuum cleaners\") combined with layers of specific misunderstandings (e.g. what \"stress\" and \"vacuum\" mean in context). It's not a bad question; it's a question that's formulated in a really clever way to seem bad.\n\nSimilar usage of the word appears on /r/ShittyReactionGifs, /r/ShittyFoodPorn, and elsewhere. Posts that are simply \"mediocre\" or \"poorly done\" generally don't do very well on those subreddits. What rises to the top are posts that exhibit that stunning and particular awfulness.\n\nWhat I find so interesting is how a large community of people all collectively came to such a subtle and specific definition of a word. Most of us don't think about what it means, and I'm not sure most people could put it into words (even I'm struggling to explain it here). But we all, on some level, know \"shitty\" when we see it.",

Please read the closing disclaimer.*\n\nThe current save functionality has several limitations that, it seems to me, affect how users will use it. For example, the number of saves is limited so it is not an archive of everything a user has saved. Without add-on features, it is difficult to categorize and search saves. These and others has me wondering how and for what purpose people typically save posts.\n\nPersonally, I save some things explicitly because I'd like to be able to find them again --- usually to share with others --- at some undetermined but quasi-distant future time. Other things I save because I don't have time (or it would be inappropriate) to look at them right now; and I mean to get back to them at my earliest opportunity. \n\nSo for me, there are clear \"archive indefinitely\" and \"read later\" functions. While I could imagine splitting them out and adding features appropriate to each (e.g., allow all users to categorize their archived posts, set the read-later list to automatically expire entries after X days, etc.) I wonder if you would anticipate any community or site-wide effects of doing so. Would this meaningfully change how people interact with the site in any way or do you see it only as a (possible) user convenience thing? Thoughts on what role \"save\" has for the site now would also be appreciated. \n\n*Disclaimer:* Please note, this is not a feature request nor an idea for the admins. I recognize, as well, that it is not something that can be achieved by mods or users. But as it investigates how the save function is currently used and what users find valuable about the site, and I am specifically interested in ToR's thoughts, I am posting it here. ",

Any entity with the right strategy and enough resources can manipulate reddit (and far beyond) as a site and steer the thoughts and actions of a significant portion of its users. Using media as a tool (again, only within devices that people are also addicted to), a nation could be steered into warm and fuzzy cohesion or violent division. Sadly, the U.S. *seems* to be going the later route.\n\nI would think that requiring users click through a link before being able to vote or comment would provide a more accurate (but still imperfect) picture of what legitimate users like/dislike, what is actually popular/unpopular, as well as increase the likelihood of people reading/watching/*learning* something before being able to leave their well-thought-out comments.\n\nI am nowhere near being a programmer so I do not know if it is possible or if it would result in the intended outcome.

This really stifles the possibilities of the platform. I wish there were a better way of balancing freedom of expression with preventing trolling. ",

That didn't go so well because some communities got really mad at me for it. I even got banned for three days from one smaller community. I then started PMing people, and some people are polite about it, but other people are a little spicy with their responses.\n\nI understand that to pester people for attention and content is a little rude, but I'm not sure what else to do.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/5uq6ps/why_does_the_independent_seem_to_go_to_the_top_so/",
        "text": "Currently The Independent holds the top two spots in and 3 in the top 10 /r/news ([archive](http://archive.is/iwyqV)) and 2 of the top 10 in /r/worldnews ([archive](http://archive.is/88BkG)). No other single outlet currently has more than one in the top 10. I could collect the data if someone doubts me, but this seems to be a trend over at least the past couple weeks that I've noticed: a seeming overrepresentation of highly ranked articles. \n\nI know the top comments on news articles are often criticizing the accuracy of the headline or the article, but this again seems to be higher for Independent articles. [This article](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5ug5ze/martin_shkrelis_speech_at_harvard_disrupted_by/?depth=9) on Martin Shkreli has two comments toward the top that point out blatant errors in the headline:\n\n&gt;It's \"AIDS\" not \"AIDs\". The S is part of the acronym.\n\nand \n\n&gt;Funny because the drug Martin bought (Daraprim) doesn't treat AIDS, or even HIV....\n\nThe quality of the journalism is frequently criticized, and I believe rightfully so. \n\n***\n\nThe Independent is now an online-only news outlet, and so the majority of its revenue comes from advertising, so it's business model is dependent on getting traffic to the site, and a high ranking in /r/all can drive millions of clicks. There's basically four main reasons I can think of for The Independent getting so many high ranking spots:\n\n1. They get their articles out quickly, before all the facts are in, and so it's the first article on an event that most people see and begin upvoting. It's basically a given that being close to the first article on a subject will make a post outperform latecomers, even if the later articles are better in a journalistic sense. \n\n2. Their articles have titles intended specifically to appeal to the reddit voting userbase. Negative portrayals of people like Trump and Shkreli, an article about SF passing a law to force pet stores to only sell rescue animals, etc., and written in a way to evoke emotion are likely to get upvotes, even if people don't read the article. Essentially click-bait, though less overt than a Buzzfeed.  \n\n3. People in the US are less likely to know the journalistic reputation of the Independent in recent years. It doesn't have the same negative reputation as Daily Mail, National Inquirer, Buzzfeed, etc. \n\n4. This one is speculative, but the crux of my post: is the Independent paying for upvotes. It's a poorly hidden secret that many companies will accept payment to get a post a certain number of upvotes within a certain timeframe. A post that gets a lot of upvotes early in it's life has a much better chance of hitting /r/all.  \n\nA website like the Independent almost depends (pun intended) on sites like reddit to drive traffic to themselves. The Independent has both the means, motive, and opportunity to do this, and the outcome looks almost suspiciously like this has occurred. \n\nI think ultimately the Independent's success on reddit is likely a combination of these factors, and certainly the first three. But what do you think of the last factor?",

Also, it seems like a lot of surveys that get posted to smaller subreddits end up with results that show a 75-25 split too. I think some larger subreddits like /r/MagicTCG and /r/Economics seem to have 90% male subscribers too.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some subs that are primarily female too. /r/femalefashionadvice, /r/FancyFollicles, and /r/MakeupAddiction come to mind.\n\nBut do you think there are any subs that have more of a 50-50 split in terms of gender?

I knew that t_d would be the first, but was surprised to see r/AdviceAnimals as #2. I thought it was a fairly popular sub.\n\nI don't go there often, but occasionally I'll browse through the sub. I haven't really put much thought into this sub until noticing that they were #2 in unpopularity, but there are a couple of things I have noticed over the last year or two that may be contributing to their decrease in popularity. \n\nI have been a member of reddit for almost six years? Back in the day, when I was first on reddit a lot, I would go on r/AdviceAnimals quite a bit. The memes were funny and original. More importantly, they were on point. Then there was a good two years where I was extremely busy and never on reddit, and definitely out of the loop, so things may have changed. \n\nSo now when I go on r/AdviceAnimals? Often times the memes don't even make sense. I haven't seen success baby used correctly ever in the last two years. Confession bear is rarely used properly, and I often just roll my eyes. \n\nThe last point I would make is that the comments seem rather juvenile, and I would guess that the average user is probably age 18. It didn't used to be like that. \n\nWhy do you think r/AdviceAnimals has gotten so unpopular? ",

        "text": "I recently submitted a YouTube link to one of the default subreddits. The post was removed automatically upon submission, citing a subreddit rule that forbids political posts. However, the post did not meet the subreddit's definition of a political post.\n\nUpon inquiry, one of the mods explained that the reason for the removal was the inclusion of a certain country name in the submission's title, seeing that said country was \"subject to political things\". I should explain that the country name was used in the title as a designation of the nationality of the artist that was featured in the submitted link.\n\nPer my request, my submission was released from captivity and allowed to join the normal queue, but my request to change the policy was answered with a plain \"No.\"\n\nI'm of the opinion that default subreddits should not discriminate based on nationality, that they should not make submitting otherwise valid content harder due merely to the content's association with a certain country or nationality. While I acknowledge the necessity of using bots to help with the grunt of moderating, and while I understand that bots cannot make perfect judgment in every case, I do expect their algorithms to be reasonable, and I feel that the blanket removal of content from a default subreddit based solely on the appearance of a country/nationality name in the title is not reasonable.\n\nI'll appreciate hearing other people's opinion on these matters.",

I hope admins work to be transparent about the filter and even encourage subs to not drop below it.\n\nBut I guess it could further the circle-jerk if people filter based on opinion rather than behavior.  It seems that may be the most popular use of it now.  Not sure T_D could ever actually be palatable to the majority of the website.
