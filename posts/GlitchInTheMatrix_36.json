        "text": "It was in 5th grade. I was 10 years old at the moment. I had a short friend, around the same age as me, whose name was Joel. He was from my class.\n\nOne day, around late May, we went on a school trip to a pool. Everyone was excited about that, including me, of course.\n\nSome hours later, I noticed that the friend I had referenced before, was crying. There were a couple of kids surrounding him, looking at me like I had done something wrong. I asked \"why is he crying?\". A kid then said that someone had tried to make him drown. I asked who had done it, and someone said I was the one who did it. I got really confused. In my head, nothing had happened. I was just swimming like everyone else. Then some adult, a female teacher, I believe, asked him what had happened. To that my friend answered that I had tried to make him drown. She, with reason, apprehended me. Now I was even more confused. \n\nI still don't know how that happened. I'm glad I (?) didn't really hurt him though.\n\n(excuse my crappy writing)",

        "text": "When I was in the 3th class we used to go swimming, we had to take the bus because it was at the other end of the city. I remember that we were on the way back to the school and i focused really hard on the clock and thought about something. It was 11:25 (I still remember the exact time) when i first looked at the time. A few seconds later a kid stands up, quickly runs through the bus and the teacher saw him. So he were really pissed off and told him if he sits down another time, we will have to stay at the school the next time we go swimming. I was still focusing on the clock without a reason. It was 11:27. Then I realised how stupid it looks to watch the clock for 2 minutes. I talked a bit with the student next to me. When I looked at the clock for the next time it was 11:25, I was shocked, I was 100% sure that it was 11:27 when I looked at the clock before. But what absolutely killed me is that the exact same student stood up and ran through the bus, with the same reaction of the teacher.\nWhat happened? Could my brain have made this up because I was a bit sleepy or something?",

        "text": "Let me preface this story by saying I am a man of regarded and assumed above-average intelligence. Today has been weird to say the least and I am still trying to get a grasp on it. \n\nSaturday night I got off work, came home and awaited my roommates return from the bars so I could grab a drink or two and see how their weekend was. As scheduled I landed in bed around 4am and realized I didnt have my phone to set my alarm for work this morning. \"Whatever. ::Mosey over to laptop to set computer alarm::\"\n\nI wake up earlier than expected, before the alarm and went to search the areas I was in the night previous for my phone. It's nowhere to be found. This is odd, our house isn't a labyrinth and I was in 2 places for 95% of my night. I was already late for work at this point and decided to leave and deal with the phone later.\n\nGet to work for my first of 2 shifts, manager said we were going to be busy and asked me to come in early. Bar is dead by the time I get there and I leave for my two hour break. **Distinctly remember grabbing my wallet, which I keep next to my keys in the drawer behind the bar.**\n\nDrop my bank off at the financial office and drive home. I decide to go to the gym and, fuck, its leg day and I need new weightlifting shoes. Lets check Store X on the way to the gym, they might have some. I proceed to change and go to grab my wallet but I cannot find it. This is nothing too unnatural. I struggle with very severe ADHD and my mind can be moving through a bajillion things at once.\n\nUsual places for my lost keys, wallet, etc: Hutch right by the front door, my desk in my room, in my truck, or on, in, or contorted some in the fabric of my bed.\n\nI check all of these places once on a sweep and find nothing. Proceed to do a deeper search of all of them and still nothing. Ok, I must have left it at work if its not here, only logical explanation....Right?\n\nI go to the gym and have a nice lift. Squats and Deadlifts today. I love DL. Something about picking up hundreds of pounds off the ground makes me feel manly. I return home with a new drive to find my wallet, it does $175 cash in it, btdubz. \n\nThis is where I decide to take a stand and find my missing phone, wallet, and watch that I lost 1 day prior to this instance. A watch keeps me focused because I see the time and visualize the tasks that need completed. One night without my watch sucked and if im tearing up the house I may as well actively look for it as well.\n\nTear everything off, near, and including my bed, desk, room in general, couches and garage. Nothing. Not a single item I am looking for. Decide, once again to take a shower and deal with it after Im done with shift 2. Grab my towel, off my bed, and hit the showers. \n\nClean Taylor emerges and step opens the door to my room. (Its connected to my room). I barely have a chance to finish opening my door and staring me smack dab in the face is my wallet...Not on the floor or obscure place, but right on my bed. Isolated from everything else and right on the corner like it had been left there purposefully. \n\nIt was so obvious and oblivious that I am 199% sure I would have seen it had it been there before the shower. Flabbergasted I step in to the room and on my first step happen to look down and my watch is right there. Directly in the middle of the floor by itself, not masked by anything.\n\nI made a point to clear my floor and make sure nothing was floating around while I was tearing everything up. Again, 199% sure I would have seen it had it been there before the shower.\n\nAs this happened, I did tense up a little. I KNOW my wallet and watch were not there before I showered and to see them both staring me in the eye as I got back, unobscured from anything was startling.\n\nI say, fuck it and mad dash to get ready for work in 14 minutes. Grab my clothes from the dryer and in the process take off the old watch I was subsituting for my everyday and place it on the washer.\n\nThis is where things get sketchy again. I go to work and come home to find my cell phone on top of the washer, right next to the watch I took off 7 hours prior. My mind runs through the possibility that a roommate found it and just didnt make it to my room, 5 feet from the washer.\n\nI interrogate my roommates as to who found it and where it was. Nobody claims to have found it but 2/3 did mention seeing it on the washer earlier in the day. The 3rd said he never saw it.\n\nSo here I am with 3 items that supposedly went missing for various lengths of time show up right in the open after I delibrately search for them. I am, by no means, a bad looker, dunce, whatever else have you. I am simply a guy who is trying to make sense of this.\n\nBefore anyone starts, definitely not roommates. Just not possible given all the facts. What the fuck happened to my stuff while I aimlessly searched for it?\n\nI really would like others thoughts, ideas, or other explanations, Cheers",

As I was going through them, I saw some pictures of me wearing the shirt I had been wearing the day before. Which was weird, because I definitely didn't remember taking any pictures that day. I'd just been laying on the couch watching TV most of the evening because I felt sick. There were maybe about 7, and they were all of me, sitting in the place I had been the night before. They were normal selfies, except for the fact that I have absolutely zero memory of taking them.   \n\nNow, I have an iPhone, and you can't view the properties of the photos on the phone itself (as I found out that day, trying to confirm when these pictures were from). I hadn't worn the shirt since the week before, but I thought perhaps I had worn it again earlier in the week and forgot? But then I looked at the photo immediately before them, which was an accidental screenshot of my phone lock screen, dated from Wednesday. I definitely didn't wear the shirt Wednesday or Thursday, so the pictures couldn't have been from then. It was definitely taken on Friday, the day before. If it happened the day before, why couldn't I remember taking them? In any case, it creeped me out so I deleted all the pictures I had taken.",

Anyway, I have been having these \"premonitions\" or whatever you call them since I was around 10-11. \n\nThe first time I recognized this phenomenon, was in the 7th grade. I was sleeping one night and I was in that \"half-awake\" stage of sleep. My mind is going off in different directions with thoughts being processed without me actually acknowledging it. Then my \"conscious\" kicked in and I started seeing things. I saw my English teacher getting incredibly mad at a kid in my class. She was yelling at him and he was just sitting there like \"Ok.\"  Now these thoughts happen in just about 4-5 seconds and they're gone. But I can remember all of the details from what was on the board that day to what clothes I was wearing. \n\nAt the time, I just dismissed these thoughts as something stupid. 3 days pass and then IT happens. My teacher just started yelling at this kid and she was going off on him. And I just sat there with this look of shock on my face. \n\nSo ever since then, I have been recognizing these things and even talked to my friend about these and he says he has them occasionally. \n\nGlitch, I don't know.

I was carless, but everything I needed was in walking distance, so I trekked my way on foot. On one particular day, I was walking by a fast food establishment and noticed a tree that looked strikingly similar to a ballet dancer. I couldn't name the position for you, but from the right angle it was uncanny. \n\nOne evening a large group of my friends were having a bon fire on the beach when two girls walked up and asked to join in. They were from out of town and wanted to have some fun. We obliged and ultimately after some time, decided walk up to said fast food joint. I brought the tree to the attention of the two girls and one of them gasped. She had a tattoo (just one tattoo mind you) of the same tree, shaped as a dancer, in the SAME position, tattooed on her back. \n\nOut of all the girls, and all the trees in California, the two collided.

Before, students could submit an assignment just how you'd attach one to an email. After the switch, we now have to upload it, select the file, and then submit it and \"sign\" it. A couple weeks in, I accidentally uploaded two assignments and apparently,  forgot to finish the submission proceas. Sure, I could see how I may have accidentally done that. I was disappointed that I got no credit on the two, but hey, whatever. Anyways, almost three months went by, I obsessively check and re check to be sure I submitted the week's assignments.\nNow, four weeks ago, I started a new class. The first week, one of my assignments had two copies of one required screenshot,  and was missing another. I was confused, but I caught it before the assignment was due, and figured that hey, that was something I might not have noticed as well.\nThe next week (or rather,  after the next week's assignments had been graded), I see the teachers comment on one,  explaining the assignment all over again, and I've got a score of zero...The fuck?..  I go look to see what I had submitted, and it's a copy of one of the first week's assignments.  What the hell?  I checked that shut. Know I did. Whatever.  I turned it in and lose a couple points for lateness.  The next week,  I make double, triple fucking sure I've got the right assignments in. Yep.  I'm good,  those are the correct assignments.  Gave the files REALLY specific names so I could really be damn sure. \nA couple days late,  I check my grades.  Again,  one assignment from the teacher had a complete explanation of what I was supposed to do.  Check my file,  and is a copy of the other assignment I turned in that week. \nI don't even know.  I've either gone nuts or been hacked.  I changed my password,  again,  after submitting the assignments this week. I took screenshot of the page showing the file submitted just in case.  I have certain accounts with simple passwords,  but for my school account is a damn complicated and nonsensical series of letters and numbers,  that nobody else has ever been given,  and that is also not written,  or saved,  anywhere. It's just only in my head.\nThe worst part is the teacher who's treating me like an idiot, though I suppose I might be one.\nEdit: Fixed a spelling mistake.",

        "text": "It was 5 years ago, I was 13 and walking to school with a friend. We were walking the usual way we went to school, down a path with a field on either side just a minute away from where I lived. At the end of the path was the pavement to either side, and straight down were some steps leading to the road below. At the time my family had a cat, an outdoor cat that was outside 75% of the time, so there was nothing unusual about me seeing her sniffing at a Pepperami wrapper on this path I walked down with my friend. Or there should have been nothing strange about seeing her there. Usually I would have just walked past my cat, with it being completely normal for her to be outside in this area, but on this occasion I had the unbearable urge to take her home. I resisted the urge as I knew we were going to be late for school, but I picked her up for a cuddle instead and we went on our way, the cat returning to the wrapper on the grass.\n\nMy cat was ran over and killed shortly after we left, as she wandered down the steps and into the road, where I saw her blood as I wandered back home afternoon - and instantly knew what had happened, and ran the rest of the way crying.\n\nInfo: we knew the cat had died shortly after my friend and I as we have a neighbour that found her just as school was starting.",

I was driving along in a car in the passenger's seat and I thought \"Somebody just died\" I turned around out of instinct and in a second I saw a man walk in front of a car, get hit and turn gray. I said aloud \"Uh somebody just died\" and explained what I saw. Well our destination was just a block away so we got turned around to look at what happened because I thought I just imagined it maybe. Nope, a shabbily dressed man with a jug of open liquor had walked into traffic, and someone was already calling an ambulance. Sometimes I think it might have been crossed brain signals, like I just THOUGHT I had said it before the man died, due the jolting effect of seeing someone getting killed by a car.\n\nThe next story is not quite so easily explained.\n\n\nA friend in the occult has a story, i might still be able to find the year of the game it took place in,  it's been about 20 years. He was watching the Olympics live and it was hot and just really a boring day in the diving event. A friend was also with him who is an occultist. He said aloud \"What I really want to see is one of these guys to jump up and come straight down and bash his head on the board.\" And everyone kind of laughed. So he went to the kitchen to make a drink. Everyone called him in and literally right after he had said that some diver had hit his head on the board. He didn't die but they ran in to hospitalize him. Anyways, that's creepy timing. Of course he didn't get to see it either, until the rerun. He says he didn't feel bad because he didn't know him, but he thought it was very bizarre. He says his friends were all looking at him like he was the most evil magician alive. \n\nHe now runs abrahadabra.com and has a lot of weird stories about people dying around him. Pretty spooky guy.

        "text": "So, I just found this sub and I am going to post a couple of different stories I experienced growing up. The most memorable ones are my gaming/dreaming glitches that I experienced, and I did it pretty often. \n\nI had a Nintendo 64 back in the day and would play all sorts of games. But sometimes I would get stuck on the games and being the type of person I am, I would turn them off and go do other stuff, like play outside or watch a movie. Well, sometimes when I would sleep,  I would dream about how to solve the problem and get farther in the game. I remember it very vividly happening with my Zelda:Ocarina of Time and StarFox Adventures games. I was stuck in the water temple on Zelda (who DIDN'T get stuck there?!) and then being able to make my way farther into the temple while dreaming, and then waking up the next day and it looking exactly like my dream. Same with StarFox. I was stuck on a new planet and the camera angle was preventing me from seeing where I needed to go next, and in my dream the camera angle changed and I made it through to the other side and through the forest area. It also happened a couple of times with Eternal Darkness, but as a kid, that game was freaky, so I always woke up pretty quickly when my brain started playing that game. \n\nAlso, sometimes I like to go back and play some of my old games. I can dream about where I put them and there they are. OR, sometimes I look in the place I think it is, and it's not there. I check over and over and I check all around and I can't find it. Then I stop looking and when I go back to the place I originally thought it might be, there it is, unusually sitting right on top waiting for me. \n\nLike I said, a lot has happened to me over there years, so when I stumbled upon this subreddit, I read stories for like, two hours straight and I got continuous chills because a lot of stuff posted sounds a lot like the stuff I experienced. Look for my other posts that I will be writing and tell me what y'all think! ",

And it's kind of off the beaten path. Not too bad but it's sorta back woods. So i was riding home with my brother and his friend. Now the other person driving was our friend Alex. He didn't fully know the way out of there so he said he would follow us\n\nSo we are driving along these gravel roads and Alex got kinda far behind us but still within eyesight. So we get to this 3 way gravel road intersection and we turn left. Left or right well get us home just as easy but left is a little safer. Less hilly and curvy. Anyway my brother told me to look behind us and make sure Alex saw which way we went. Sure enough Alex's car rolls around the corner and I specifically see the headlights shine in my eyes. So we keep driving. Alex's headlights shining into the car we are in. Suddenly they just disappear. Like someone just pressed delete on Alex. We look, there's nothin, we turn the car around and drive back, there's nothin, we even got out of the car and looked around, nothin. \n\nAt this point we are just freaking out. Alex just disappeared. Out of no where just went away. So we called him and he answered and said he went right on the intersection because he likes to drift and it's more fun and he doesn't recall any car behind him at any point. So what happened? The three of us watched Alex's car turn onto the road, follow us, then poof disappear. It still kinda freaks me out.",

        "text": "I was sitting right here, where I am right now, in my home office, looking at my computer screen.  To the left, out on the periphery, suddenly appeared a small smudgy glowing blob that moved around in almost straight lines.  It was enough in the periphery of my vision that I couldn't quite focus and see what it was.  I was focused on my computer..  But it was close enough that I could make out it's rough shape and movement; it moved to a spot, then switched direction, moved elsewhere, and just basically moved around like that, seemingly in the same general area.\n\nThis happened about 10 minutes ago and lasted about 5-8 seconds before I decided to turn my head to look at it directly.  I didn't want to look away from my computer screen because I was focusing on something important and memorizing it, and whatever I was seeing didn't seem threatening or anything of the sort..  I figured it was some sort of a reflection off some light in the room and that I would check it out after I was done writing out what was in my mind. \n\nSo after those 5-8 seconds I quickly looked to the left, eager to see what the glowing blob is.  But then as soon as that happened, it was just gone.  No hint of any reflection, no heat or light sources except for my lamp, on the other side of the room, and a small bit of a glow from my roommate's room.   What surprised me the most was that it just disappeared as soon as I looked..  Faded out as quickly as I turned my head.\n\nIt would be impossible for anyone to shine anything through my front door to get a blob of light where I saw it.  The angles involved imply that the person would have had to have been inside the room, or outside - out the window somewhere.  But I live on the 3rd floor on the top of a hill overlooking single and 2 story homes..  Plus it didn't really look like it came from that direction, it's to my right..  it looked like just a floating blob flying around, not like a projection of a beam or anything like that.\n\nThis was pretty weird, I've never really experienced anything like it before.  I can't explain it, so I'm posting it here.",

        "text": "Necessary details to start with? I guess one would be that English isn't my first language, as I am from India so I might have difficulty in expressing myself during some circumstances. It's not that important, just that anyone who is Indian has a vague idea of how the telephone network lines work here. The last but not the least, I have a very uncommon name for an Indian guy, you would need this info as I’ve changed my name in the story for the sake of it.\nWe got our first land-line phone installed in the late '90s (most probably 1998, I honestly do not remember..sorry!). The number was 4519484(number changed for the better, no point looking it up). If you were to call it up from an outer state, the prefix 016-(changed) is to be added. I was a kid at that time and we were really happy since not all the households in our neighborhood had a phone at that time. It was pretty cool, we were proud of it. I have two elder sisters who were in school at that time, the eldest being 9yrs. elder to me (Indian families, no big deal, don't ask). My name comes from combining the initial letters of the names of my two sisters, hence, the unusualness. Anyway, we had a dog that died in the year 2007. My old champ, a Spitz who lived his life to the fullest.\nThe phone had been disconnected in the mid-2000s since every family member of ours had a mobile phone (Yes, including me, a kid). A year or two before it got disconnected, due to some new government regulations or amendment I honestly don't remember, the first digit of every phone number in our state was changed from 4 to 2. So, like all land-lines, ours became from 4519484 to 2519484. Now, here I must mention a weird habit I had of dialing my own land-line number from the land-line itself(hence, getting a busy tone...yeah, I had too much time to kill). When I got my first cellphone, the habit didn't go away, in fact, in my free time, I used to dial both the numbers(4519484 as well as 2519484) always ending up getting the message that the numbers are invalid. I really missed those days (I used to prank call a lot since we didn't have a Caller-ID then, also it was the only way of talking to my friends outside of school so I had a lot of fun memories with it).\nToday, 2014, I'm a grown ass person with a smartphone working in a nationalised bank (No name given..duh) and my habit had faded with time, almost diminished but... a few months ago, I had been sitting idle in my office with no customers to cater to (it was really hot outside so no one came). What do I do, I pick up the bank's phone, randomly with no idea of what to do next, my subconscious mind makes my fingers dial the old land-line i.e.4519484. Now, I should specify the message that actually used to be delivered while dialing this number after the initial digit was changed, the message used to be \"SORRY, YOU SEEMED TO HAVE DIALED A WRONG NUMBER, PLEASE CHECK THE DIGITS FOR CONFIRMATION\".\nMoving on, I dialed my own old land-line and surprisingly, the bell goes. My heart skips a beat, I don't know what to do, the first thought was that a new series of land-lines must have been started using the old numbers that have long been disconnected. Curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to know who picks up, afterall, if anything goes wrong I can always pretend that I'm from the Bank and probably dialed a wrong number while trying to get to some other person.\n\"Hello!\", says the voice on the other end.\nThe moment I heard the voice, all the memories of my childhood, everything I had left behind to become the person I am today, came in a sudden flash-back. My whole world shook. Why? because the voice, I don't know if I sound insane, please believe me, the voice was of my mother. But not her voice as it was towards her later age before her death, but the way it was at the time our house got its first phone. She sounded young, pleasant, busy as if she was doing some household chore and I disturbed her.\n\"Hello\", she said again, my throat choked, tears welled up. I don’t know what to do. What the hell was wrong with me, it could have easily been another woman with a similar voice, right? NO. It was HER voice, I knew it. Deep inside my heart, I knew I had tapped something way out of my reach as a sentient being(sorry for the word, nothing better in my mind). It was almost like all my life I had that extra-ordinary habit, for this particular day. Someone/something far bigger than us was toying with me. What else made tears come out was the bark I heard behind her voice. My old champ, happy and alive, young and energetic. I could recognize his panting from any other dog, let alone his bark. He always barked when the phone rang.\n“Hello? Who is it?”, she said, practically shouting. “Maa”, all I could say, before the first loud sob came, followed by a stuttered breathing!? If that’s what you call it. The lady paused for a moment, probably wondering what the hell was happening,”Son I think you dialled a wrong number”. That was it, I couldn’t take it anymore, I cried like a baby. It WAS her, my god, the voice, the tone, the love. I’m still crying and I always do when I remember her. My mother was the closest person I ever had, the pains she took to make me study, the money problems we had since my dad had a lot of issues, she had been the breadwinner for the house for the most of our lives, that is, until the day she got sick and no one could save her.\n“It’s me Rohit, Maa…I love you”, I muttered while weeping. “Rohit?...Where is he? What happened to him? Who the hell are you?”, she shouted. That is when a fear took over me, fear of the unknown I guess. ‘This shouldn’t be happening’ kind of fear. Or ‘this is some goddamn devil work playing with your fucking mind, probably to drive you insane’ kind of fear. Or as I’ve seen what they call it here, the ‘nope! Nope! Nope!’ kind of fear. I slammed the phone down. I was shaking way too much to even stand up, I was almost pulling my hair, all the while crying. My colleagues were all over me, asking the exact question I couldn’t answer, “What the hell happened?” Turns out I passed out, I woke up in one of my customer’s clinic. Feeling everything as if it was a dream. My blood pressure had gone low enough to kill me in my unconscious state, but thankfully, it didn’t.\nWhat happened afterwards? Nothing, I never tried the number, too afraid. Even though I almost know I’d get the wrong number message back again, I know the phone wouldn’t be picked ever again by anyone. My instincts tell me it was a one time glitch in God’s timeframe that I had come across. In any case, I do not wish to take the risk.\nI just wanted to get this out of my system, thank you all for reading. TLDR: I phoned in the past... like IN the PAST",

The week before school started, I had a nightmare. \n\nI walked into a restroom, it was abnormally spacious, covered in pink tile with a very large mirror across the wall over the sinks. Two other girls are in there, washing their hands. I continue in, to walk into a stall, when one of them screams. I look over and arms are coming out of the mirror, pulling her in. I rush towards her to help but before I can make it to her, she disappears into the mirror and it ripples like water. The second girl is still standing over the sink and she looks at me in horror before turning back to the mirror. It's normal now, like nothing ever happened, she looks at me in the mirror and starts to speak but before she can finish the sentence she too is being pulled in. I grabbed at her feet to pull her out but I can't, she disappears in as well. I back away from the mirror, to the wall across from it and make my way back to the door. \n\nAnyway, my first week of high school, I stop to go use the bathroom on the first floor of the building and what do I see. Giant mirror, big bathroom, and pink tile. Nope. I marched my happy ass to another floor.\n\nNo idea where this came from either, this was before \"mirrors\" and those other horror movies.

        "text": "OK, I am seriously freaked out right now.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, while stationed in England, I realized that I hadn't seen a couple of my diplomas in a while. These were pretty important to me, as I had spent a year or more at a specialized school to earn each them, and I was proud of them. I had a vague memory of having brought them to work one day to show someone what an \"old\" diploma (from 1985) looked like. I had a bad feeling that maybe somehow I had left them in the food court and never noticed until then. My wife and I tore the house apart. We searched every shelf, cupboard, box, cubbyhole, and Rubbermaid tote. Nothing.\n\nWell, maybe I had just imagined having brought them to work. Maybe somehow they were in storage with our other stuff, either back home where we had a storage locker, or in the stored items the military was keeping for us while we were in England. I didn't believe this for a minute, but I had to hope. I couldn't believe I'd lost them, but they sure as hell weren't anywhere in our house in England.\n\nFast forward to last summer. We're packing up to leave England. We emptied every closet, took all the books off the shelves. All the stuff you do when you move. The whole time, I'm thinking, \"Those diplomas have to be somewhere.\"  But nothing doing. No sign of them.\n\nWe get here, we unpack our books, fill the shelves, unpack our other stuff, find places for things. No sign of diplomas. We go to our storage unit in NY. We open every box, every milk crate. Nothing. Damn. We bring it all back to Florida, and search again. Nothing.\n\nWe wait for our storage items from the military -- our last hope. Of course not. Nothing.\n\nI'm kind of devastated. We went into the garage, and we opened every box we had. One last time, in a vain search. Nope. So I break down, about 2 months ago, and I wrote to the school, asking about duplicate diplomas. They tell me they'll gladly provide new ones, free. They'll have the right dates and info, but they'll be on the new forms, signed by the current staff. Fine. Please send them. And they did, and I have them, and they're nice, but not the same.\n\nAbout half an hour ago, I asked my wife for her copy of a teacher qualification test study guide. She looked, and couldn't find it. So I said, \"I'll help look,\" and walked into the dining room where the bookshelf is. She described the book to me, and as I'm scanning the shelves, I look up, and on the top shelf, next to a couple of dictionaries, I see...\nMy diplomas, in their presentation cases.

We UNPACKED the books here in Florida, and filled the bookshelf.

They were NOT there, and then they were.\n\nI'm a little weirded out right now.",

For example the last one went like this:\r\r(everything in here is not written in past tense bc I felt like I was watching from someone else's eyes.)\rI wake up in my room. Everything seemed normal because I didn'tpay attention, there is no way I would be waking up on another floor. I get out of bed and two abnormalities are clear. I am not sleepy and I am like 10-15 cm taller, around 190-195 cm. I walk straight through the hallway and open our main house door. This part is when shit got weird.\r\rOur house is normally on the 4th floor but the door opened to a ground floor. In this place, everything was effed up. No elevators, all the walls made of wood or similar disintegrated things and many things were reinforced with wood. There is muffled small and heavy arms fire in the background of this. I peek out of the hole. There is ruined landscape outside, almost as if we were bombed heavily and were in a bunker in the middle of the city.\r\rThrough the small hole, I see three people that are saying \"we are here to help\". These looked to be a doctor and two nurses but they had unsettling grins and their voices sounded very disturbingly dangerous. So, I walk towards what seems to be a door with a huge hole in it reinforced with planks. I look between two planks and this \"medical help\" is staring directly at me. I pull out a holstered pistol. I fire twice at this squad and down the doctor and a nurse. The other nurse also fell down for no given reason. I decide to check the room like thingy on my right side. They aren't there either. There is also a window here, conplete with nice curtains and light pink concrete walls, almost a miniature living room. As I try to inspect the window by getting close, the surviving nurse crawls in from there. She smiles at me. A good, genuine smile and I don't shoot her.\r\rMy mom read it like a fortune teller and predicted it was about my college life: I would have things get torn apart the moment I left home, I would shut down friendships and a girl with only good intentions but eventually, I would get a faithful wife(or girlfriend)and things would settle.\r\rIt could very well be that and seems possible but it might have also been me viewing the future of the matrix then the exploit being covered up by putting in that perfect room and the nurse and hoping I would think it is a dream.",

I tried to get up, but I was paralyzed. I felt trouble breathing, and when I tried to speak, I was breathless. With trouble, I turned my head over to my mother's bedside table, and sure enough, the alarm clock was sitting on there. However, it was turned towards me, but it should be turned towards her bed. The time on the clock read 3:27. Don't ask how I remember, such a time never stood out to me before or after that.\n\nI wake up just after that, feeling lightheaded and out of breath. I turn to my alarm clock, and I kid you not, it said 3:29. Again, such a time doesn't stand out to me at all. I never forgot that night, and to this day I don't know what happened or why it did.",

I used to love to sit in his lap while he watched the news. Anyways I was sitting in his lap and he was rocking the rocking chair all of a sudden it was almost has is someone pressed a pass forward button on my life and what was going on around me. The rocking chair seemed to speed up and things like people walking by seemed to happen super fast. Even the sound of people's voices seemed to be speeding. It used to really upset me when I was younger and when someone would try and comfort me it would make it worse because whatever they were doing it seemed like they were doing very fast. It's hard to explain but the beat way I can is like when you used to have to rewind VHS videos except it was like my life was being fast forwarded . This still happens to me from time to time and I don't know what to make of it. ",

        "text": "Hi all, I have been a fan of this subreddit for a while, but until today I read most of the top posts of this subreddit and I started remembering a lot of stuff, kinda glitchy. I don't remember how many glitches I have encountered in my life, some have been visions or dreams maybe my subconscious telling me something that I didn't catch while awake. A little bit about me I am a 29 y/o Mexican, now I live in Vancouver, BC.  Ok, here I go...\n\nFirst mini-glitch or vision that I remember was when I was around 7-8 y/o, I was living in Mexico, and me and my neighbors were playing soccer on the street (we used to do that when it wasn't dangerous) it was about to get dark, when we saw 2 weird lights on the sky chasing each other, all my friends and I saw it then we look at each other and we freaked out and flee to our homes, obviously my parents told me I was being dumb and we never speak about it. I know it could be a lot of things, but it was around 1990 and my city didn't have a big airport at the time (Morelia, Michoacan),  so I don't know.\n\nSecond vision, I was around 15 y/o we were camping with my high school group at the top of mount Paricutin, we were lying down on the grass, it was around 11 pm I was with my best friends at the time, we were watching the stars, they were so many and bright, when I freaking kid you not, they freaking start moving in weird patterns, I look to my friends and asked them, are you watching this? is it me? and they clearly were watching it because we all felt really scared, ok, I admit it, there was alcohol involved in that trip but I didn't drink at the time. I have tried to speak my friends about the incident but none of them seem to recall it (with the excuse they where drunk or that they don't remember), I mean my whole high school class was there, about 25 ppl maybe? I don't remember what I did after that, I think I went to bed, afraid. I just remember they moved in a weird pattern =S, this has been the most terrifying thing experienced in my life so far.\n\nThird glitch, I was dreaming that my gf at the time was involved in a car crash. I was sleeping with my gf at the time, about 18-19 years old. when I woke up crying about 4-5am about she being in a car crash, she was beside me, so she calmed me down saying it was just a dream, and yes it was. Later that afternoon it was raining a lot, she was driving to university when yes, she crashed, nothing bad happened besides some vehicle damage but still...that dream was really vivid like I was there watching the accident, it's like a memory not like a dream...\n\n...which goes by hand with my fourth mini-glitch, it involves the same gf. This time, it's last year of university so I am 22. It is the last day of university, I know I will be graduating so I do whatever person at my position after 5 finals would do, yeah, go to sleep. So I have this freaking vivid dream about my gf at the time, having sex with my friend. This dream is again so vivid, I am in this room I don't know and they are having sex, I can hear them, feel the heat of their bodies, even smell them..it was disgusting... I woke up about 6 pm, I went to bed like 3 pm it was a long nap. And she was there chatting on her computer, so I tell her about the dream and tells me basically I am being silly for my behavior (I did ask her after I woke up, are you having sex with X?) She feel offended and didn't speak to me for a while, I was ok, played videogames and then she went out with her girlfriends (liar), my curiosity was big, so I did open her messenger and read all the lovely full sex, loving messages between her and X, I confronted her, blahblahblah, we broke up, etc. again this dream is like a memory, I can even remember the bedding colours, etc.\n\nFifth glitch, the several encounters with a man with a mustache in Vancouver, so I moved to Vancouver around 2008, and around 2009, I start seeing this guy everywhere (he is around 50 y/o), I mean he looks like any normal person, he just has this normal looking mustache (which is the only remarkable thing about him in my memory), nothing particularly weird about him. But I start running into him in a lot of places, the skytrain, the canada line, several malls, even the bus, and it is not like I was in the same route everyday or at the same time, he was just there, wherever I was, so I think (I just got a chill in my spine while writing this, even if it is not scary at all) he notices that too, and starts waving at me, so I wave back, this happens like 5 more times randomly. One day I when going to work, by bus, he walks in, and sit right next to me, he says hi and tells he is a cars dealer, we do a small talk, when suddenly he makes an angry remark to the bus driver and says I am sorry I am watching lights today in my head with a really bad headache so I am upset, so I tell, him: so you suffer migraine? (I know this because I have been suffering for minor migraines since 16 y/o aprox) and he says migraine? I don't know, this is the first time it happens to me, so I describe my experience and he agrees on that is how exactly he feels (seeing an aura, before having a really bad pulsating headache), I tell him that I recommend to see a doctor so he can give him migraine medicine like Realpax or whatever medicine to relieve his migraine pain, he says thanks, and gets down on the next stop. I never saw him again. Today reading this subreddit made me remember him. And that was the last time after that conversation that I have had migraine.\n\nAnd last glitch, so in 2011 has been the worst year for me for a lot of circumstances, after a lot of work, family, money issues, I develop this fear to die for brain cancer or an aneurysm or thrombosis or whatever, something is happening in my head I was sure of it, I got freaked out I went to the neurologist because I had been having these bad headaches for a while now, nothing is found, so I am glad. I am still edgy for a lot of shit going on at the time so I develop  severe anxiety for 6 months, feeling death is near, outburst of crying, waking up scared in the middle of the night ,my wife is concerned, I feel like something is going to happen, but nothing does, this started around April 2012, and I had to start taking clonazepam to calm down. This goes on, until February 2013, I bought tickets to go visit my friends and family to Mexico with my wife, because Semana Santa is close (holidays for Mexicans, so I can spent time with most of them), when 2 days prior leaving I get a call from my aunt, my dad had suffered an brain thrombosis, and I felt obviously really worried and sad, we went to Mexico and is still living, he can't move his right side of his body really well but he is alive and better right now. After that I don't feel the fear of something happening to my head anymore....the point is, did I attract that? Did I know something like that was about to happen?...\n\nOh well, thanks for reading, I know this are not really super glitches I just wanted to share with you. Thank you. \n\nAny thoughts are more than welcome.\n\nEdit: Lots of grammar, spelling and some minor fixes.",

The hospital required everyone be up to date on their vaccinations and required two TB skin tests, which they would provide for us free of charge.  So I went to orientation(7/23) and afterwards they had a clinic where they would administer the first test, and then I would have to come back in 48 hours(7/25) to have read.  I did not attend this clinic because I had a job interview an hour after the orientation was supposed to end(7/23) and was going to a conference in Texas from 7/24 - 7/27.  So I scheduled a different appointment time for my first test, which would was for today.\n\nToday I woke up with my left forearm sore and tender with a random discolorations and I'm assuming bruises.  I didn't really get too concerned or pay too much attention to it since it wasn't life threatening.  When I got to my appointment, the nurse sat me down and started talking about how I would be getting my second test and would need to come back in two days.  I explained to her that I have yet to take my first test, but she showed me some paperwork that was signed off and said I had already received my first test, and she pointed to the discoloration on my arm, and said she recognized it as a mark from an old TB test.  So I just went with it.  No idea what happened either...",

        "text": "So, there's been some weird stuff going on in the last 2 year's that I can't explain. I'm not here to throw theatrics and plot twists at you, I'm just as lost as anyone else would be. I got a new phone a few years ago, at its time it was a top of the line smart phone, and I've had it since. No big damages or noticeable problems since I got it, but two isolated incidents have happened that aren't as scary as they are disorienting and eerie. The first one happened a year or two ago, I really don't remember any of the details for this one. It was insignificant and it's been so long I guess I just deemed it unimportant. I was out with my friend Skylar and his grandma driving around looking at Christmas decorations and such, I think. It might've been the night after, either way the only important part is that I was on a dark main road. I got home and there was a mystery photo in my phone. I don't know if I took it with me, and I barely remember the photo, the only reason I even remember this happening is because of what happened an hour ago. The photo was of a poorly lit road, with safety cones all over the mid area from construction. The road was part of a highway if I remember correctly and was surrounded by dense woods. The only stand out thing about the photo, asides from the fact that I didn't take it and it had no real significance, was a rogue light, so to speak. It was a small cluster of bright orange lights, and it wasn't matched to anything. Not a car, safety cone, street light, nothing. It was just there. I'll dig around for it, but it's not the prevalent problem. Last night I went a town over to watch Guardians of the Galaxy's premier at the Cineplex. It's a long drive, anywhere from an hour to two hours, and we spent quite some time there. I left with Skylar and a bunch of friends at 8:15, we got there early enough to dick around in the theatres mini arcade. The movie started at 10:35, we arrived at 9:20 and departed around 1ish.

I had no watch, mobile device or other time keeping device on me, and the only times I have are the ones printed on my ticket receipt.

I was going to send my friend a picture (unrelated) on Facebook earlier when I noticed the picture. First picture on my phone, only one not from the day prior, was a picture of seemingly nothing. I sent it through to my friend to see if he could help me figure out what it was, after staring for a while we noticed that there was a safety railing and I realized it was a picture of the bridge downtown by the waterfront of my hometown. It was taken at night and the light was still there. As I said earlier, I didn't take the photo, I wasn't home. I didn't have my phone on me and it was dead when I left. I'm hoping someone here can figure this out.

He was quizzing me on the state capitals (believe it or not, this was usual road trip fare among the two of us). I can usually rattle all of them off pretty quickly, but it had been a while since I had practiced them, so I was having a little trouble.\n\nHe asked me what the capital to Iowa was. I couldn't remember it off the top of my head, so I listed a few of our joke answers, such as \"The Salsa\" (don't ask). Then, no fewer than 15 seconds after he had asked the question, we came to a road sign on the highway that said \"Des Moines\" in about 10-foot-tall letters. To those potentially out of the loop, Des Moines is the precise answer to that question, the capital of Iowa.\n\nWe looked at each other for about as long as someone can afford to look away from a highway while driving.\n\nBefore that day, neither of us had any idea that there was a Des Moines, Washington. It was pretty much the highlight of the trip for my grandpa, and he told the story to just about everyone he knew.\n\nDefinitely the weirdest coincidence that has ever happened to either of us.",

We looked up when we saw a second one being hurled at us by a mysterious shadow. That brick fell on the roof of house on the ground floor. We all rushed to the building roof with sticks, WE FOUND THE DOOR TO THE ROOF LOCKED. The interesting part is there were no bricks on the roof while we were playing, we are absolutely sure about this because we play there everyday.",

        "text": "Ok here's something that happened to myself and a friend, years ago,  1995/96?.  Nobody ever believed us mainly because my friend had and still does have a horrible habit of exaggerating things.\n\n  Our friendship didn't necessarily end over the years but I have some anger towards him where we haven't spoken in years.  But we both know what happened that night and over the years when we were still speaking we would always talk about this night and we could never come to a conclusion as to what happened. \n\nSo here goes, we were about 16 or 17.  I needed a ride to my grandmother's house, I don't remember why.  My friend offered.  We went, had supper with her,  watched some tv on rabbit ears.  Played cards.    Very small town Nebraska, with a grandmother who loved saying when I was your age we didn't have, enter 90s technology here.   \n\nIt was 10pm.  Home was 30 miles away but there's another small town 15 miles away.  Empty highway this time of night very open country.\n\n  Now when you pull out of this town its a T. To turn on the main highway.  Left takes you to the town 15 miles away and in Nebraska that's a 10 minute drive. When you make the left it takes you up a hill.  My friend and I were talking going up this hill.   And we both reached to change the radio station at the same time.   We both noted the time 10:03 I dunno why we noticed the time but it was as if something wanted us to make sure we both knew what time it was.   I still remember the glaring blue clock light in the dashboard radio. \n\nWe look up when we presumed to be at top of the hill.  Nope were about 50ft from the flashing warning intersection sign of criss crossing highways,  one that is a notoriously dangerous intersection in the Town 15 miles away.  \n\nNow I had the urge to slam on my breaks because we were so close to the intersection but before I even hit the brakes but I noted we were going 10mph \n\nBoth of said a collective what the Fuck are we doing here so soon.   We looked at the time.   10:04.  There's no way we could have went 15 miles in 1 minute but we both vividly remember this and to this day ill swear on my grandmother's grave that this was the time that had passed.  We don't remember the drive at all. And even though it's  open county highway.   There are very noticeable landmarks that neither of us remember passing",

I thought some would like this story.\n\nI live in a somewhat rural location, it's pitch black outside if the moon isn't out and the street lights end about 100 meters before my house. Needless to say, walking home at night can be a bit unnerving. I was at home by myself and my wife and daughter were staying at her mother's place. Anyway, I got home late since I could stay out with friends later than normal since I didn't have to worry about the baby. I came home, and my dog was outside. Weird. She is an outdoor dog, but we always put her inside when we leave. So I get inside the house and I'm trying to get her to come in but she doesn't want to. Just standing at the bottom of the steps acting anxious. I'm getting a bit creeped out so I turn on the lights, and shut the door. I get her a new bowl of water and go back outside. She's sitting on her spot, comfortable, right next to the front door. I try to get her inside again but she doesn't want to go. So I think \"Meh, I'll just leave her on her spot and she'll scratch at the door in a few minutes\". I open my computer and plop down on the couch. It's pretty late and I fall asleep while watching tv. The next morning I'm awoken by my wife calling and asking \"Where the hell are you?\" (I was supposed to meet her in the morning.). I had the alarm set on my phone, and I tell her I still have an hour, to which she responds that \"No you don't, you're supposed to be here now. You're still at home?\". I then look at the clock on my computer which is still on the table by me. The time there is set to a different time than on my phone, I then look at the wall clock (battery operated) and that clock is also set to the wrong time. I finally google out \"what time is it?\" while talking to my wife, and basically all of the clocks I have were set to drastically wrong times. Then I think shit, the dog, she's never spent a night outside by herself. So I hang up the phone and go outside, she's still sitting on her spot, wagging her tail, as happy as can be. So I'm in a rush to leave now so I'm trying to get her inside and she desperately doesn't want to come inside. So I'm like screw it, I'll just leave her out again since I'll be back in an hour. So I left with her outside. Now she never comes into the house.  I'm building her a dog house now. Oh, and one last thing, when I went to correct the time on my computer I noticed the \"global settings\" button had been unchecked. To my knowledge I always had it set to update the time automatically. ",

At night, the part where my bed is at is pitch black while the other side of the room is a little lighter due to street lights shining through the blinds. Anyway, I'm laid there and I feel my friend roll out of bed. She walks to the light end of my room and starts searching through my hand bags and drawers, and I sit up to watch what she is doing. She walks towards my full length mirror and starts staring at her reflection for a long time, looking confused and curious.\n\nI ask \"What are you doing?\" and she jumps and turns to look at me, mouth hanging open in shock. And then next to me, I feel someone roll over and murmur \"Whaaat?\" in a sleepy state. I can just make out my friend still curled up next to me in the dark. I shine my phone light on her to check. I look back up at whatever was walking around my room and it is gone.\n\nI know for a fact was my 'friend', she has bright blue hair and I could see it in the dim light. There was no doubt it looked exactly like my friend. I was not dreaming because my friend and I ended up talking for a little after I woke her up and we even put a post on Tumblr, and my friend can remember the conversation (even me asking what she was doing, which would have happened while I was 'asleep') and the post online was there. Some have suggested it was sleep paralysis, which doesn't make sense either because I sat up. \n\nAny ideas? Or just a glitch in the matrix?",

We hit it off instantly and always have strange occurrences happen to us and because we smoked a lot of weed back in the day never thought anything of it. \n\nHowever one day at school, I think we were in 11th grade at the time, we were walking the hallways during lunch with our friend Cam. We were really supposed to stay in the commons where we ate lunch but sometimes we just didn't feel like following the rules.. ha. It was probably 11:20ish when we were headed back because lunch period was about to end. \n\nAll of the sudden about ten or fifteen bright blue lights started coming out of the ceiling before our eyes. They were maybe about the size of a golf ball but the glowed even though the lights were on in the school. The weird thing about them though was the way they moved. They flew around the ceiling almost like a fly or a bee would, kind of darting around as they simultaneously floated down about halfway to the floor. Then they just disappeared. The whole thing lasted about 3 seconds.\n\nJ and I just stopped in our tracks dumbfounded by the whole thing. I said, \"Woah did you guys see that?\" J replied \"Yeah, what in the fuck?!\" Cam just kind of stood there and said \"What are you guys talking about?\" Apparently he didn't see them at all. We tried to explain it to him and he thought we were crazy or messing with him. Nope we weren't. It really freaked J and me out. I don't know what it was about the lights but I just didn't like it. It made me feel better that he and I both saw them because I would have doubted myself and thought maybe I had imagined it all. \n\nIt could have been something electrical or whatever but the thing is it didn't happen under any lights or anything. And why didn't Cam see them? There was no way he could have missed them. If anyone could debunk this, that's great, because it has bothered J and I for years now and we want to know if there is an explanation or if anyone else has had similar experiences with lights.",

I was getting ready to go out and I put my shorts on, and noticed there was a button. My parents aren't home, nobody who would've fixed them, and I definitely can't sew.

However, for the last 3 or so months, whenever I call their house my phone number pops up with the full name of my former roommate who I have not lived with in a year and a half.  It happens every time now, and I can't figure it out. We only lived together for about 6 months in a city that's 65 miles from my parents so I don't know how any lines could have gotten crossed, especially since my parents live in a small town with a little private cable company. I even got a new phone about a month ago and it still happens. Anybody have any theories??",

        "text": "So I just found this sub and all the stories here are absolutely fascinating and mind blowing. I'm kinda disappointed I never checked it out before to be honest. But I have one that I think you guys may enjoy from my childhood. \n\nBack around 10 or so years ago, I was probably 10 or 11 years old. I was at my parents house real late watching tv in my parents room while sitting in a recliner while my dad was asleep in the bed next to me. Mom was at work and, if memory serves, my sister was at my grandparents house (I can't remember where she was exactly, I just remember she wasn't there).\n\nAnyways, being an 11 year old boy, I did what all 11 year old boys do when their parents have access to Cinemax and fall asleep pretty early, I was watching some soft core porn on tv (next to my sleeping dad, I know I know. But he has always been a pretty heavy sleeper and I was paying close attention in case he woke up so I could press return and go back to some other movie). \n\nWell, it's around 12 or 1 and I hear the garage door open. I figure mom finally got off work (she's an accountant and this was tax season so she was there late). From where the recliner is in their room, I can see down the hallway and I to the kitchen where I had left the light on, I never was a big fan of the dark. I hear the door to the garage open, and footsteps and the light shuts off. Then.. I don't hear anything else. \n\nNo more footsteps. No mom shuffling papers around on the kitchen table in the dark. No fridge opening up for a drink late at night. Nothing. \n\nSo, getting kinda nervous, I holler \"mom?\" No answer. Thinking my sister may have gotten to wanting to come home I yell \"sis?\" No answer. \n\nI got up and shut the door and locked it and didn't leave my dad's room that night. It had me almost shaking. I asked mom what time she got home the next day to which she answered sometime around 2 or 3 when my encounter happened much earlier in the night. My sister never came home that night and nobody has ever experienced anything else like it in the house before or since. ",

It happened almost 4 days later, to my mother's surprise again.  A little later on I was staying at a friends house and had a dream that Michael Jackson would die.  I got home and told my mom, joking about it like it might happen like Rosa Parks.  Well about a week after that Michael Jackson died, and I was shocked.  Since then nothing has happened, but it's sure freaky that they did.",

She had to be at least sixteen, she said, because she was married, she was helping my grandmother get their shore house ready for the summer. \n\nThey took to get ready for dinner, but they ate dinner early so it was about three or four, and while they were cooking a knock came to the door. A voice shouted, \"Hey! It's Pete! Open up!\" My grandmother and aunt did not go to the door but shouted back, \"What is it?\" And *Pete* responded, \"It's important! Aunt Anne has died.\"  \n\nMy aunt said she never saw my grandmother move so fast. She ran to the door, yanked it open, and no one was there. Looked out, walked around, no one.\n\nMy grandmother was so pissed. She thought the kid was playing some sort of sick prank. My aunt said that she yelled into the street something like, \"if you come back here with this nonsense *you'll* be dead!\"\n\nDay continued on. They ate dinner. My aunt put my mom to bed for my grandmother. No more 'pranks' from Pete.\n\nThat night, a knock came to the door. A voice shouted, \"Hey! It's Pete! Open Up!\" My grandmother just responded, \"Go away!\" And he said, \"It's important! Aunt Anne's has died!\" \n\nMy grandmother went to open the door and was like, \"This is some sick joke you're playing\" expecting no one to be there, but he was. Pale faced and shocked. \n\nAunt Anne had really died. 20 minutes or so before Pete came over the second time. And Pete had no idea what they were talking about when they mentioned the shit that went down that afternoon.\n\nNo one ever believed them.\n\nCreepy shit. I wonder if they had called and checked with someone in the city the first time, maybe they could've stopped something. Who knows?",

        "text": "This is a memory I've had for years and now knowing about this subreddit makes me want to share it. My brother and I once shared a dream when we were younger and it goes a bit like this.. \n\nMy brother and I had a bunk bed in our room that we shared. I slept on the top bunk and remember having this incredibly vivid dream where I was a FBI agent or something of the sorts and I had to arrest my brother for having done something illegal. He refused to be taken in and began running. Cue a chase scene from about any action movie. I chased him through an empty school but couldn't catch him. He burst through a back door and jumped into an awaiting hot air balloon. Now I knew I couldn't do anything to stop him now but I had to do something so I reached for the gun I had in my dream, aimed, and shot him in the chest. Having done this kicked me awake and that's all there was to my dream.\n\nI saw my brother was still asleep so I went downstairs to get something to drink and when I came back my brother was sitting up looking incredibly tired but also incredibly pissed off. \"What's wrong with you?\" Then he said,\"I had a dream and you shot me asshole.\" Before I could even tell him my dream, I stood there mouth gaping while he retold the same exact dream. He was on the run from me, ran through an empty school and escaped via hot air balloon but before he got away, I shot him. \n\nThe craziest part of this though is when he said his chest was really sore too and lifted up his shirt and found a bruise, that he never had before, where I shot him in the dream. I think dream sharing in the first place is glitch material but I've heard stories of dream sharing from other people that I've told this too. I've looked up dream sharing before because of this to know it's not necessarily uncommon but the fact that he had a bruise along with it too freaks me out...",
