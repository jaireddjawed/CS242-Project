But in addition to suffering from Chronic Anxiety, Christine appeared as a flake. On the first occasion a male tried to “make-out” with her, Christine freaked out. But that was deliberately construed to pivot her diagnosis into P.T.S.D. That’s why Ford tried to portray herself as having a flying phobia -which turned out to be untrue.  Furthermore, P.T.S.D. is associated with Hyper-Memorization of the traumatic event. That’s what causes anxiety-triggers and flashbacks: Trauma patients recall all the details associated with the trauma – event, to forever avoid it`s repetition. Yet this so-called trauma-victim remembered nothing. While amnesia can occur with trauma, that occurs when the event is so catastrophic that the patient dissociates.",
