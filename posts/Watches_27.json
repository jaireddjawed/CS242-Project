        "text": "Hello watch enthusiasts! Let me start by saying I have no knowledge or interest in watches. Needless to say, this did not stop me from buying 4 from an Italian watch salesman on the street - let me explain. We struck up a conversation as i was walking home. He said i looked Italian (which i’m not but often get) and we started chatting. After a bit, he invited me into his car and showed me some watches. They were in a watch dealership bag, packaged and still wrapped up. it was a rental car, and he had watch catalogues from his company, and an ironed suit in the back. he also looked like a watch salesman - verniers and all. he explained that he was on a business trip and that the company had given him free samples. however, he was going back to italy and would have to pay tax on the watches, which he didn’t want to do as he could get free watches in italy anyway. the qr codes on the tags of the watches leads directly to the website and the watches seemed great quality. he said he only wanted to make back the money of the rental car £100. on the website, all the watches he gave me accumulate to over 1k. anyway i bought the watches. i’ll attach pictures. i guess i came here to ask have i been scammed big time? i have no need for watches - can i pawn then without receipts etc?\n\nAlso, i trusted him. he showed me his passport and name, and his daughters instagram hahaha",

        "text": "It's Thursday and my fingers are still recovering from having to thank all of you for all the nice words to yesterday's edition that blew up. I was not expecting something like that, but I am so glad you like this format. Now, on to Rolex rumors:\n\n# What's new\n\n[**Rolex leak ahead of Watches and Wonders destroys our hopes of a new Daytona, but... look at that no date Sub!**](https://www.instagram.com/rolexpassionreport/)\n\n/ Rolex is celebrating several major milestones this year. 70 years of the Submariner, 70 years of the Explorer and 60 years of the Daytona. So it stands to reason that there are great expectations of the brand this year, especially at the upcoming Watches and Wonders. All the smart money was on a completely new Daytona model.\n\nNow several Instagram accounts, including the reputable [Rolexpassionreport](https://www.instagram.com/rolexpassionreport/) have leaked photos from the Rolex catalog for this year. And oh boy, are some people going to be disappointed. Looks like there will be no major changes to the Daytona this year. Instead, Rolex is putting out a [gold Daytona with a meteorite dial](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpgDVUPr7_u/). In other underwhelming news, looks like Rolex will also introduce a [RHD version of the controversial LHD Sprite](https://www.reddit.com/r/rolex/comments/11m0r6k/rolex_new_leak_classic_gmt_with_green_bezel/).\n\nIn better news, Rolex is giving a gold Submariner the Hulk treatment. [The Gold/Green combo looks killer](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpgDVUPr7_u/). But what I’m most excited could just be [the no date gold Submariners](https://www.instagram.com/p/CphXzU5LY14/). That 369 version is fire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**A wildlife-inspired watch for women launches on International Women’s Day**](https://timeandtidewatches.com/the-norqain-independence-40mm-hakuna-mipaka-has-no-limits/)\n\n/ The Swiss family owned watchmaker Norqain lists Dean Schneider among their brand ambassadors. Schneider is a wildlife sanctuary founder who runs the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis in South Africa. The brand and ambassador come together once again this year to produce the Independence 40mm Hakuna Mipaka, a women’s watch with a leopard print pattern and a largely gray and black color profile. \n\nWhile the watch looks very interesting with it’s leopard grey-black cammo, the size sounds a bit baffling - 40mm in diameter by 12.05mm thick, with a lug width of 20mm and an overall lug-to-lug profile of 46.3mm. Yes the lug-to-lug is not THAT huge, but I don’t see many women wearing 40mm watches. \n\nThe case has a DLC finish, water resistance is 100 meters, and the face looks almost textured with the leopard print and applied rose gold plated hour markers filled with white X1 Super-LumiNova. Date is at 3 o’clock. the new Independence 40mm Hakuna Mipaka is powered by the Cal. NN08, which is essentially NORQAIN’s version of the popular Sellita SW200-1. \n\nWhile it is nice that 10% of the proceeds will be donated to the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis in South Africa to help further its conservation goals, this watch comes in at $3,690. A bit steep.\n\n[**Revolution is teaming up with with Tutima for a limited edition modern flieger**](https://revolutionwatch.com/tutima-x-revolution-m2-coastline-chronograph/)\n\n/ Tutima, based in the German watchmaking town of Glashütte, is a brand that has been outfitting pilots from the German Luftwaffe with Fliegerchronographs of exceptional build quality since the 1940s. In 1984, a highlight year in Tutima’s history, its reference 798 was chosen as the preferred chronograph for the militaries of NATO member states. \n\nTo be honest, modern Tutima watches have never been particularly attractive to me. They just seemed a bit basic and unimaginative. Good thing then that Wei Koh of Revolution watches is doing a limited edition with them as his version of the M2 Coastline Chronograph looks much better. The Tutima x Revolution M2 Coastline Chronograph is limited to 100 numbered pieces and priced at EUR 2,850 each. Dropping on 10 March 2023, 10pm SGT | 3pm CET | 9am EST \n\n[**The Louis Vuitton Tambour Opera Automata is completely ridiculous. But who says ridiculous is bad**](https://monochrome-watches.com/video-review-louis-vuitton-tambour-opera-automata-inside-lv-la-fabrique-du-temps/)\n\n/ Louis Vuitton has two wachmaking modes - complete garbage and the craziest level of haute horologie you could even imagine. The new Tambour Opera Automata is a commissioned watch, a piece unique that serves as a demonstration of what Louis Vuitton can do. An boy, can they do a lot. \n\nThere’s no point in me trying to explain what the watch is. Just click the link and admire it. Make sure to watch the video to see the watch in action\n\n# On hand - a selection of reviews\n\n[**In search of a budget Reverso? Fratello has a great writeup on the Vario Versa that comes in at just €403**](https://www.fratellowatches.com/hands-on-the-vario-versa/)\n\n# Watch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\n\n[**Finland’s independent watchmaker Stepan Sarpaneva celebrates two decades of creativity with a new model**](https://watchesbysjx.com/2023/03/sarpaneva-stardust-20th-anniversary.html)\n\nSarpaneva’s brand sure is polarizing, but there’s no denying his pieces are unique and striking. The Sarpaneva Stardust and Stardust Nostromo are released as limited editions of 20 pieces each, available directly from the brand. They are each priced at EUR 16,500.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis post is part of an experiment to see how watch news changes on a daily basis.

I have decided against the latter, because it turns out they are made in China and through reviews- people have said the quality is below-good. Are Ben Sherman watches made in the UK? And how is their quality.\n\nThank you so much,",

I would ideally like to get something that is more timeless (I’m thinking it can be passed on to our kids in the future or sth 😂😂😂) but also must be value for money?\n\n(1) Tag Heuer Carrera Twin Time (2nd Hand) \n(2) Tissot Le Locle Powermatjc 80 \n(3) Seiko Presage Automatic (Ltd edition - according to the shopkeeper, only 8000 produced?) \n\nMy husband is currently wearing a seiko diver on a day to day basis. I’m leaning towards the seiko primarily because it’s limited edition (haha) but not sure if it’s wise to get another seiko. \n\nWould appreciate any advice or recommendations!! Thank you!",
