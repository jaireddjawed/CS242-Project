        "text": "Recently I’ve been getting more into film and I’ve been wanting to go back and watch some of the more classic ones. Only problem is I don’t really know where to watch them as they’re not on many streaming services like Netflix. Just wondering where you all go to watch older/more obscure films. I used to go on sites like putlocker but I hate using them because they just never run smoothly for me and it’s just a pain. And tbh I don’t even know how to pirate movies. Does anyone here still buy dvds? I was thinking about just trying to physical copies of the movies but it’s also kind of inconvenient. Anyways if anyone has any tips on where to watch some good movies besides on Netflix, I’d really appreciate it. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask or if this has been asked before",

        "text": "As most of you know many old color films made remarkable use of Technicolor. Colors popped off the screen and they were contrasted with one another very well. \n\nHowever I have noticed a trend in blu rays of some films, where although the sharpness of the image is improved, the colors are reduced and altered. And example of this is the films The Ten Commandments (1956) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955). \n\nIf you take a look at the link below I have provided for The Ten Commandments. You will see that the image is much darker, and the Technicolor pastel blues have been tuned into a strange teal. Many of the other colors have also been desaturated. Some shots seem untouched and are stunning but most of the picture has gotten this bizarre treatment. A similar case can be seen on a  Blu Ray vs DVD comparison of Written on the Wind (1956)\n\nFor Rebel Without a Cause, although the colors haven’t been altered much, the shadows have been raised to a near excessive extent, and there’s a teal glow in most of the darkness shots. You can see this in the link to DVD Beaver I posted where if you scroll down to the screenshots on the page, you can see a proper Blu Ray vs DVD comparison. \n\nI find it strange that the restoration teams are doing this as it’s their job to preserve a films features, Technicolor being this. Considering the amazing restoration work that was done on the Blu Ray of Ben-Hur (1959), why would they botch this job so badly? What do you guys think of these restorations? \n\nThe Ten Commandments DVD vs Blu Ray: https://youtu.be/C8g32OZjKgE\n\nhttp://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare11/the_ten_commandments_dvd_review.htm\n\nRebel Without a Cause Blu Ray review: http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film4/blu-ray_reviews_60/rebel_without_a_cause_blu-ray.htm\n\nBen Hur Blu Ray review: http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare/ben-hur.htm\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It's long been argued that films best be left as reflections of their time; that social mores and terms since deemed politically incorrect should not inform one's views of the work. But there is a valid counterpoint. As shows like *Mad Men* only enhance the inherent sexism of the 1960s, we're encouraged to re-evaluate such issues – particularly knee-deep in the #MeToo movement. This is not, as some might fear, reason to dismiss a work of art, merely to point to its flawed-thinking as a document of history. \n\nThe Birth of a Nation (1915)\n\nD.W. Griffith's epic about two opposing families during and after Lincoln's assassination is perhaps the only one listed still taught in cinema classes. At three-hours long, it's the first American film to run 12 reels and be screened inside the White House by then-President Woodrow Wilson. From Thomas Dixon Jr.s' novel *The Clansman*, the film's portrayal of African Americans is problematic, to say the least. Played largely in blackface, they are unintelligent and, in a key scene, just a little rape-y.\n\nFalling Down (1993)\n\nJoel Schumacher's angry white man film takes place in a post-1992 Los Angeles, when furor over the Rodney King verdicts led to the burning streets. However, aside from one early encounter with a gang, Schumacher's embattled laid-off defence employee (Michael Douglas) takes on overpriced Korean grocers, neo-nazis and entitled golfers. And it's one-sided, pat-on-the-back attitude of capturing a modern crisis is undercut by surrounding Douglas with characters we're not meant to identify with – it's no shock that the first of which is an immigrant, followed by a gang. Audiences are only meant to cheer for him while he scares an elderly golfer into a heart attack.\n\nOne could view Douglas as the ultimate Trumper (nazism excluded), and they wouldn't be wrong. It's only in the film's final moments, when Douglas seemingly rebukes the concept that his country was taken – that his actions speak more to his character – that it stops lining up with present day. Today, Douglas would be sure there were “fine people on both sides.”\n\nAmerican Sniper (2014)\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint when Clint Eastwood stopped being a filmmaker and started being an empty chair-yelling faux-documentarian, but Sniper is a good signifier. The man that defined “manhood” to a generation turned out to be all the worse aspects of it. And with his loving biopic of sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), his MAGA hat was being pre-stitched.\n\nBut Kyle's legacy has since been tarnished, or at least marginally disrupted, by allegations of xenophobia and outright lying began to surface. He comes across less a tragic figure forced into war with a very specific set of talents, but a goon and a bully. Later, even his family came under fire when charitable donations from Kyle's memoir were called into question.\n\n1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992)\n\nPull any American off the street and they will likely get the founding of their land wrong – their heads filled with elementary school stories and urban legends who've done their damage. Many a late-night talk-show has exploited the ignorance of their fellow countryperson for a gag. Leave it to a Brit to tell you your own history, and Ridley Scott's attempt to dramatize Christopher Columbus' four attempts (three, according to the film) to travel the Pacific may be the closest mainstream one yet, but it's still loaded with anachronisms regarding The Nina, The Pinta and The Santa Maria, Spanish culture at the time. It also claims, that the flat earther theory was still in popularity, though the idea of a round earth was common knowledge to anyone for over 1000 years at that point. But Scott et al. still surround the story with the kind of hubris long-since debunked. At least it's visually engrossing. More embarrassing is the Alexander and Ilya Salkind-produced *Christopher Columbus: The Discovery*.\n\nOleanna (1994)\n\nDavid Mamet has never been one to shade his female characters with great depth. Their counterparts are fast-talking, erudite, fowl-mouthed Chicago men who, in reality, would probably be closer to SNL's “Da Bears” fans than whatever the hell Joe Mantegna is. But perhaps most embarrassing and timely, given the #MeToo movement, is his play-cum-film *Oleanna*. William H. Macy plays a stressed out professor who first kindly, then aggressively tries to explain his teachings during office hours to a seemingly slow student. However, soon allegations of rape are brought against him, among other issues, and the tables are turned. The film ends explosively, intended to bring into question whether or not what occurs is, in fact, sexual harassment or self-righteous political-correctness. Today, however, that question is less ambiguous.\n\nRambo III (1989)\n\n*Rambo III*'s politics are legendary, as the muscular hero teams up with the Taliban to fight the Soviets. The franchise had lost its way after the moderately tame first entry, which features a PTSD-inflicted Vietnam Vet ostracized by a small, Oregon town. By the time James Cameron's script for*Part II* featured him re-fighting (and winning) Vietnam, it wasn't the same, heartbreaking story. But part III's good intentions were the same as that of Senator Charlie Wilson, who helped arm the Taliban before they turned their attentions elsewhere. Cold War politics weren't easy, and Rambo was never the answer.  Hell, neither was Rocky.\n\nJoe (1970)\n\n1970: A year earlier, the 60s had officially died at Altamont. The Vietnam War raged. Two years later, the offices of the DNC at the Watergate hotel would be broken into. John G. Avildsen's *Joe* not only inspired characters like Archie Bunker, but swore off actor Peter Boyle from appearing in films featuring violence. After businessman Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick) kills the drug-addled boyfriend of his daughter (Susan Sarandon, in her debut), he's blackmailed into a friendship with working class racist, hippie-hating Joe. There's a tragic story connected to the climactic scenes, in which Joe and Compton gun down a group of hippies. Ten weeks prior to release, a railroad worker killed his daughter, her boyfriend and two others. The judge had excluded any juror who had seen the film.\n\nJoe was never meant to be a likable character. To the contrary, he's a bullish, crude, hopefully irrelevant monster. The actual killer received hundreds of letters of sympathy from parents across the country. Joe, instead, represents the rise of the “silent majority” - who have largely been courted to by American politicians since Nixon.\n\nTo quote *The Big Lebowski*, “Condolensces. The bums lost.”\n\nDeath Wish (1974)\n\nAuthor Brian Garfield never intended his novel to be a fascistic revenge fantasy, hating the Charles Bronson film that resulted. Rather, he believed it was a cautionary tale. After Bronson's wife is murdered and wife raped by an anonymous gang (one a young Jeff Goldblum), he goes on a killing rampage – often intentionally putting himself in harm's way to unload on a criminal.\n\nBronson went on to have a long action career, but Paul Kersey – his *Death Wish* character – has a different legacy. When news of a subway vigilante hit in a crime-ridden New York, general public reaction was fairly positive. They had their own Kersey. That is, until New York got a look at Bernie Goetz – the openly racist shooter.\n\nAnd that's not even discussing the film's abhorrent reputation in the age of mass shooters. Eli Roth's poorly received remake displayed that particular public animus.\n\nMost 80s Comedies\n\nWe've spoken about the dated language and racist archetypes in [John Hughes comedies](https://www.filmquirk.com/single-post/2018/06/13/Five-Relevant-John-Hughes-Works-And-Four-That-Absolutely-Arent) before, but the fundamental issues with the 1980s go far beyond such matters. Take, as a light example, the repeated use of the word “fag” in *Teen Wolf*. It's so tone deaf that there's still a sense of absurdity that just leaves modern audiences with their jaws hanging open. That's understandable – words, after all, are about context and through the lenses of today one might just view the character as an imbecile or a dated archetype. But then look at what is clearly a pro-rape scene at the climax of *Revenge of the Nerds*...",

        "text": "I need to write down my thoughts about Blade runner's sequel. I'll use the original to explain what's lacking in 2049, not for the sake of comparison, just because it's a handy example.\n\nVisuals: In 2049 they seem to be there just for the pleasing aesthetic effect. In the old film, they were original, characteristic, meant to be remembered. They set a style that defined how we figure future: but also, they played a part in the movie, and had distinct meaning. In Villeneuve's movie it's hard to tell apart one scenario from the other, because all of them melt together. It recreates many elements of the previous movie, without adding anything of value. \n\nStoryline: the original film feels like a classic tale, with a simple plot driven by a few well drawed characters that avoid easy judgment. \n\nReplicants were perfect but had an age limitation. They craved for a longer life, for survival. It's an universal instinct that makes perfect sense, and needs no further explanation. That's why it works.\n\nHere we've got a manicheistic setup plenty of forgettable guests that feeds a script that puts innecesary questions. \n\nWe find out that because of the events of the first film, they had to cut down the production of andys. Ok. And then there was a blackout, so there was no trace of the older ones. After that they found a way to build them, but without free will, so they become standard again. In that context, the guy at charge at new Tyrrell's wants them to procreate, because he can't produce enough to fullfill his vision of a world with so many andys. And since he's undoubtedly the bad guy, he wants to locate the only child born to a replicant couple, but in the cliche \"bring her to me I don't care about anything else no one's gonna stop me\". To make it clear that he's the baddie, he -and his assistant- kills two girls just so there's no doubt about that. And then there's the other cliche good andys who hide in some factories and worship that same girl as some messiah. So that's when our hero arrives, who goes from one place to anoher with a cam following him so we can call this a movie.  \n\nReally, this narrative is very poor. On top of that, here nothing remains of the question of Deckart being or not a replicant, which added depth and different lectures on his already conflicted, of dubious moral character. \n\nThe sequel separates even more from the original material, and fails at showing reverence to it.\n\nThere goes my rant. Poorly structured, strangely written, but honest and straight.",

        "text": "So I just went to see Ant Man and the Wasp a few days ago and I noticed almost instantly that the cinematography in it was a little peculiar. It's kind of hard for me to explain, especially for someone who only knows a little about cinematography. Basically, the way it was shot and the lighting and focusing of it all made it look really similar to like a car commercial or commercial of some sort. Ahhh it's really hard to describe but it just looked very much like an advertisement and not a movie. It kind of was distracting for some scenes because it felt like the effort on the cinematography was lost. Granted, other times I hardly noticed it. I would say it was definitely more noticeable in daytime, exterior scenes. Something about the contrast between the foreground and background and how it was lit kind of seemed weird to me. Also, the way that the background was blurred out and how the actors in the foreground were focused on gave it that commercial feel to it. I've seen this before in other movies recently too. I can't think of specific examples but I've seen it in a lot of recent trailers as well. If I can recall, the trailer and clips I've seen for Tag had the same kind of look to it, too. I'm just wondering if anyone has any explanation for this or am I just totally making this up in my head? I really hope this doesn't become some sort of trend in movies because it kind of looks crappy and the aesthetics of a car commercial aren't what I want to be seeing in a film. Thanks for anyone who has answers or thoughts on this!",

One of the most revelatory voices to emerge from the postwar explosion of international art-house cinema, Bergman was a master storyteller who startled the world with his stark intensity and naked pursuit of the most profound metaphysical and spiritual questions. The struggles of faith and morality, the nature of dreams, and the agonies and ecstasies of human relationships—Bergman explored these subjects in films ranging from comedies whose lightness and complexity belie their brooding hearts to groundbreaking formal experiments and excruciatingly intimate explorations of family life.*\n\n*Arranged as a film festival with opening and closing nights bookending double features and centerpieces, this selection spans six decades and thirty-nine films—including such celebrated classics as The Seventh Seal, Persona, and Fanny and Alexander alongside previously unavailable works like Dreams, The Rite, and Brink of Life. Accompanied by a 248-page book with essays on each program, as well as by more than thirty hours of supplemental features, Ingmar Bergman’s Cinema traces themes and images across Bergman’s career, blazing trails through the master’s unequaled body of work for longtime fans and newcomers alike.*",

Like always the complete post is below, but if you want the pictures to make it more complete the link is [https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/17/its-just-a-reflection-certified-copy-before-sunset-and-the-cinematic-language-of-romance/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/17/its-just-a-reflection-certified-copy-before-sunset-and-the-cinematic-language-of-romance/). Today is also our 6 month anniversary of the site &lt;3.\n\nThank you guys for being a great community, and allowing me to share some great insights on some of the best films around. Let's get another discussion going\n\n&gt;**“Forget the original—just get a good copy.” – James Miller**\n\n**W**e open on an author’s event, a small crowd listening intently to our male lead discuss his new book. He is charming, intelligent, and perhaps a bit full of himself. In attendance is our female lead, portrayed by a beloved French actress with ties to the Polish master Krzysztof Kieślowski. She is here because she is curious about the book and even more curious about the man. You see, the two share a passionate history—old flames from years, if not quite lives, prior. Soon we will be whisked away from this book signing and plunged headfirst into the neuroses of these former lovers, as they walk and talk against a strikingly beautiful European backdrop. Their names are Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), and the film is Richard Linklater’s eternal classic *Before Sunset*.\n\nOr perhaps not. What if instead their names were Elle (Juliette Binoche) and James (William Shimell), and the film is Abbas Kiarostami’s elusive masterpiece *Certified Copy*? How could you know from the description alone? In truth, you couldn’t. So striking are the similarities between these two films that they practically beg to be compared. Both explore romance—what it means to be in love and how the passage of time can both dilute and amplify the passion of a relationship—and operate in similar modes, primarily conveying their ideas through animated, often philosophical back-and-forth conversations. And while Kiarostami and Linklater are vastly different writers, at their core both are poets blessed with the gift of gab, born to create and document human interaction. Who better to write these conversations?\n\nOf course, there are key differences between the two couples. Prior to the events of *Sunset*, Jesse and Celine had only spent a day together, which we know because of the previous film in the trilogy, *Before Sunrise*. And as passionate and utterly engrossing as their time in Vienna was, it was still just twenty-four hours. Hardly a relationship. In contrast—though the particulars are shrouded in mystery—Elle and James clearly share a long, complicated past. In fact, it’s all but confirmed in the film that they have a son together. A son!\n\nAnd yet for the first half of the film, we’re led to believe that this is the first time these characters have met. By pulling this trick, Kiarostami displays the whole spectrum of a failed relationship, from simple beginnings to a tragic end within a single day, in effect positioning Elle and James not just as two people with shared intimacy, but as cinematic mirrors, reflecting the very notion of romance itself. In this manner—to bring in a central theme of the film—they are copies: copies of the husband and wife tandem Elle consults in a quaint, fountained courtyard; copies of the newlyweds they take a picture with at a popular tourist destination; copies of the ancient couple they see strolling out of church, arms linked, bones trudging against time; and yes, copies of Jesse and Celine, star-crossed lovers were given a second chance.\n\nOne of the most noticeable things about Jesse and Celine is how handsy they are with each other. They routinely touch the other’s arm, shoulder, what have you, as if they’d been together all these years. Jesse even sweeps Celine up off her feet at one point—*literally*. These moments augment the palpable tenderness established between them in *Before Sunrise*. As syrupy as it may seem, small gestures like this convey true affection. A simple tap on the shoulder is more than just that; it’s the currency of love, the subtle acknowledgment of one’s presence. The old husband by the fountain says as much in *Certified Copy* when he pulls James aside to offer “a piece of fatherly advice.” At this point, they’ve not spent five minutes together and already the old man can tell how fractured Elle and James’s relationship is. Then, after saying their goodbyes, James takes the old man’s advice to heart and places his hand on Elle’s shoulder as they walk away in silence. It is notably the only moment where James initiates any sort of embrace, simple as it may be (they share a moment outside of a hotel, featured in a picture above, but Elle is the instigator). Needless to say, it isn’t very convincing.\n\nIt is also, in many respects, a direct mirror of one of the most affecting moments in *Before Sunset:* Jesse’s backseat bombshell regarding his recurring nightmares about Celine. The anguish in his voice is profound, as he shakes and groans through the admission. He is not a happy man, his loveless marriage solely buoyed by the existence of his son, whom he “would suffer any torture to be with for all the minutes of his life.” Celine is understandably moved by this revelation, her face fraught with emotion as his words resonate. In spite of, or perhaps *because* of, how pained and tortured the moment is, it is clear that this is a confession of love on the deepest level. And how does she respond? By reaching for Jesse’s head. It’s brief, and in the end, she never makes contact, opting to pull back at the last second. Jesse doesn’t even notice, his back turned. Crucially though, we do, and we know it’s as sincere as any action ever committed to film. No one prompting her, no one offering her advice. Just pure instinct. Pure love.\n\nThat sincerity is at the heart of the *Before* trilogy’s appeal. People love these films because of how real they feel. But it’s also at the heart of *Certified Copy*’s central conceit: that all art, especially cinema, is a reflection of the real world. But art in and of itself is part of the real world. Therefore, the film posits that art is not merely a mirror, but many mirrors, each informing the rest, reality and fiction blending into one (not unlike Kiarostami’s landmark *Close-Up*). Even language is a mirror, as the film constantly switches between English, French, and Italian, sometimes for practical reasons, but usually just for the sake of it. By deconstructing the various stages and modes of a relationship over the course of a single film, Kiarostami reveals the thematic connection not just between *Certified Copy* and *Before Sunset*, but between it and seemingly every film ever made about a romantic couple, which were themselves influenced by any number of factors relating to art and reality. And on and on it goes.\n\nTake that scene in the car again. Hopefully, by now I have established how Elle and James are mirrors of Jesse and Celine (if I haven’t—well, shit). But dig deeper. Is there another reflection lurking amidst that scene? I’d argue there is. If anything, Elle and James more closely resemble Jesse and his unnamed wife than they do Jesse and Celine. Think about it. The son. The emotional distance. The failed marriage. They’re practically dead ringers. Now dig even further. The squabbling. The arguments about parenting and the nature of love. The hotel room. Remind you of anyone? How about Jesse and Celine nine years later, in *Before Midnight*, a film that came out three years after *Certified Copy?*\n\nAnd therein lies the film’s genius: it’s future proof. Whereas *Before Sunset* depicts the middle chapter of a timeless love story, featuring clearly defined characters and desires, *Certified Copy* purposefully obscures itself so as to be able to live up to its title. Like the mysterious transformation undergone by its protagonists, *Certified Copy* is in a state of constant metamorphosis. No, that doesn’t mean the film’s content will be different upon a rewatch. Of course not—everything is set in stone from the jump. But as with all mirrors, the form is only part of the equation. It’s not until you hold something up to it that its true purpose is revealed. And what is *Certified Copy*’s true purpose? In the words of Arcade Fire, it’s just a reflection of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection of a—well, you get the idea.\n\nWritten by\n\n**ANTHONY GARCIA TAORMINA**",

        "text": "I've recently noticed how in the 90s, judging from movies and literature of the time, there seemed to be more intellectual discussions going on in mainstream American culture about society and more awareness and critique of how it functions.\n\nYou got classic movies in 1999 like American Beauty, Office Space, Eyes Wide Shut, The Matrix, and Fight Club that either critiqued the ideal American lifestyle as something that is being manipulated by the powers that be, or encouraged the average American to break free of the repetitiveness of a day-to-day work routine.\n\nThen when 9/11 happened it seemed like Americans relied on mainstream media for information and for a way to feel safe; whether that safety came from knowing what was going on with the War on Terror, or from escaping reality with entertainment like American Idol and other shallow content.\n\nIt was as if the culture of intellectual discussion had faded and we submitted to mainstream consumer culture in the new century.\n\nNow, since the Recession and with our current government, young people are more interested in political and social topics, which is reflected in entertainment like Mr. Robot and Sorry to Bother You where resistance against the corporations that control American life is encouraged.\n\nWas there more intellectual thought happening in entertainment in the 00's that I'm missing? Forgive me if my post sounds pretentious or stupid. I'm still trying to understand these kinds of topics and since I graduated film school last year, I haven't had many thought provoking discussions on TV and film.\n\nI know there are more articulate people on this subreddit, so does anyone have any input on postmodernism in TV/film/culture throughout the 1990s-2010s?",

        "text": " [Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLfN69RD6NU)\n\nThis week I saw Paul Schrader’s thought provoking and evocative drama, First Reformed.\n\nSchrader, perhaps most famous for his iconic screenplay collaborations with Martin Scorsese on the likes of Taxi Driver writes and directs the film with a deliberate and assured touch. Centering on a fantastic lead performance from Ethan Hawke, First Reformed follows a priest of a small congregation in upstate New York who finds himself grappling with wide ranging environmental concerns when he is asked to counsel a troubled parishioner. \n\nHawke plays Reverend Toller, a man of faith who seriously doubts his own wisdom and abilities, clearly emotionally damaged, whose insecurity is palpable in every close up. An early conversation with the aforementioned parishioner, Michael shows this vulnerability and lack of certainty exquisitely, the points raised about the future of our planet acting as a catalyst that begins an intense inner battle within him. Schrader mirrors these concerns beautifully, the widespread pollution of earth is paralleled with Toller’s toxic alcoholism, its impending death reflected in his deteriorating health. \n\nThe film is fittingly cold, the wintry setting dispelling a dark and lifeless mood over proceedings. With unconventional aspect ratio, Schrader and DOP Alexander Dynan frame their shots in uncomfortable front-on close ups, symmetrical wides and strange high angle viewpoints, the almost monochromatic colour pallette creating a world without warmth, a world of stark contrasts. The effect is almost clinical, a polarised, almost unnatural order. This contrast is strongly felt in the juxtaposition between First Reformed church, a humble, 250 year old wooden structure and Abundant Life, a gaudy megachurch that can’t even be contained within the narrow frame. Here Schrader comments on the nature of modernity where abundance is an ironic euphemism for excess. Toller’s church is a quaint tourist attraction for those who want to see a glimpse of the past where Abundant Life is a fine tuned corporate headquarters, an all consuming behemoth. \n\nSupport from Amanda Seyfried and Cedric Kyles is strong, both of which thriving in the kind of serious dramatic roles we rarely see them in. Kyles plays, Jeffers, the Reverend of Abundant Life perfectly, both cynically business-like as well as warm and charismatic. Seyfried’s Mary, the troubled pregnant wife of Michael is enigmatic and sympathetic, her relationship with Toller deeply effective in its humanity. Elsewhere, Victoria Hill plays Esther, the choir director from Abundant Life as a strong counterbalance to Toller, her obvious concern for the priest bringing out the emotion within him that he so fervently wants to keep locked away.\n\nSchrader’s imagery is fascinating, from fairly obvious yet evocatively surreal moments when Toller and Mary levitate, flying over a juxtaposition of earth’s beauty and horror to the pepto bismol poured into a glass of bourbon, seemingly mutating, almost cancerous. The latter is ominous and perfectly representative of the film’s themes, the sickness eating Toller up inside and the unnatural decay of nature. On top of the literal depictions of pollution, this man made destruction of the natural is seen throughout. Choosing to focus on the violent effects of Michael’s suicide as well as depictions of suicide bombing, the self-destructive force of man is literally shown, elsewhere a squirrel snagged on barbed wire foreshadows the sickening wrapping of this sharpened metal around Toller’s body.\n\nPerhaps the most divisive and, in my mind, memorable moments is the film’s ending. Toller, discarding his initial plan of blowing himself up with the suicide vest instead, after wrapping himself in barbed wire as aforementioned, pours a glass of drain cleaner to drink. Mary enters abruptly causing him to drop the glass, approaching and kissing her as the camera whirls around them. It  would be a huge reprieve, to the narrative gloom of First Reformed if this indeed occurs as shown but it also seems to be far too trite and convenient for a such an otherwise beguiling film. It has a dream-like or hallucinatory effect, surely a moment of imagined bliss for Toller who previously questioned what goes through one’s mind before they kill themselves. With the door to his house locked and with no way for Mary to enter, Toller undoubtedly swallowed the drain cleaner, an exaggerated progression of the poisonous alcohol the glass usually contained. \n\nWhy kill himself at all? Did Toller simply become radicalised in the way that Reverend Jeffers warned him is all too common these days? Did he believe himself a martyr for the cause, finishing off what Michael started? Or was he simply overcome with the culmination of despair and guilt that had weighed on him so heavily all this time? Schrader’s ending is far from clear cut but it’s nonetheless thought provoking and powerful in its execution. Strongly evoked themes pervade his film, some of which are the hypocrisy of society and the church, the blind following of tradition such as Toller’s insistence on his son serving in the military and the cancerous effects of guilt. \n\nEthan Hawke thoroughly deserves all the praise he has received for a fine performance and Schrader proves his directorial flair is far from diminished after a number of lacklustre projects. First Reformed demands patience but is well worth your time, its imagery lodges itself in your mind and continues to evolve long after viewing.  \n\n\n [Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLfN69RD6NU)",

        "author": "IShouldCareLess",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8zbcox/4_by_agnès_varda_cinematic_portraits_that_return/",
        "text": "https://screen-queens.com/2018/07/13/criterion-month-4-by-agnes-varda-cinematic-portraits-that-return-your-gaze/\n\nThe Criterion Collection’s set “4 by Agnès Varda” is almost like a collection of cinematic poetry, with some of Varda’s most notable works—La Pointe Courte, Cléo from 5 to 7 (Cléo de 5 à 7), Le Bonheur, and Vagabond (Sans toit ni loi). Four might seem too few, given Varda’s immense influence on cinema. But somehow, four feels appropriate here.\n\nThere are four horsemen of the apocalypse; fear of the number is common in East Asian nations where “four” sounds like the word for death; and in Tarot, The Emperor is the fourth Major Arcana card, a symbol of ultimate masculinity—all perfect omens for Varda to defy. If all this talk of omens sounds a bit superstitious, it just means that some of Varda’s character Cléo must be rubbing off on me. Varda, as a female filmmaker in a male-dominated realm takes all these symbols and turns them back against the observer. She made what many consider the first film of the French New Wave, and recently became the oldest Academy Award nominee in history; she also sports an iconic two-toned bowl cut, and gives off such intense warmth that you can’t help but want to talk to her for hours. This warmth transfers to her subjects, whom she presents without judgment, despite their flaws. In her work, she creates compelling portraits of all facets of humanity, and it is often as if their gaze is returning yours, like one of those paintings whose eyes follow you— daring you to reconsider any preconceptions you might have had about the people whose stories she tells.\n\nIn the opening sequence of Cléo from 5 to 7 (the first film by Varda I ever watched, and her most well-known), tarot cards supposedly predict Cléo’s imminent death: the film’s title refers to the hours she waits hear the results of her test for cancer. Vagabond, too, begins with death, this time the discovery of the body of the protagonist, Mona. Of course, things aren’t always as dark as they seem— each of Varda’s films is, put most simply, truly about life, and her work deeply interested in capturing real human bodies and souls with her camera. Varda began her career as a photographer and documentarian, which is immediately evident; even her narrative films blend vérité and stylistic flourish, showing a mastery of depicting humanity, and demonstrating empathy and compassion even to the most unlikeable subjects. Her recent documentary with artist JR, Faces Places (Visages Villages), shows the pair creating and mounting massive portrait-murals of the people they come along in small towns, and this work is an even more literal version of the way her films are already creating their own blown-up portraits of ordinary people onscreen. The people are rural villagers, dockworkers, and young children, and all are worthy of having their faces immortalized.\n\nThe camera, as it looks at its subjects, is always engaging in a very conscious process of looking, prompting the observer to reflect on the nature of their own gaze; these portraits are not just for passive viewing. In Vagabond, the story of a young drifter named Mona who is found dead is told in quasi-documentary fashion, with interviews with the characters who encountered Mona interspersed with scenes of her before she died. The characters speak directly at the camera as they talk about Mona, trying to understand her, and we contrast this sympathetic view to the sometimes cruel way the world treats her. Men on the beach ogle Mona and comment on her body as she emerges from the sea after a swim; shortly afterward turn their gaze to postcards of naked women. Later, another man chases after Mona in the woods, saying: “I’ve been watching you a while.” But again, there is an awareness of this male gaze, and a refusal to let the subjects be immobilized under it: Mona resists giving an easy explanation for her actions or her life on the road, choosing to live “outside”—both in the open air and beyond the norms of society.\n\nThe landscapes and communities are as much characters in these films as the individual people are. La Pointe Courte, Varda’s first film, is as much a portrait of the Sète neighborhood and its inhabitants, and Varda’s own relationship to this area where she lived in her adolescence, as it is of the central husband and wife; the vibrant color palette of Le Bonheur gives the film almost the look of a painting, though of course a painting that moves and speaks. The husband and wife are played by a real married couple, and the children by their real children, and the close-ups feel intensely intimate but never exploitative or intrusive. Autobiographical touches are presented without any traces of narcissism or self-glorification. When Varda herself appears onscreen (like in Faces Places), lends her voice to the narration (Vagabond), or photographs places meaningful to her, it is always in service of broadening our perspective. We get to see the world through Varda’s eyes, but not only through hers: we see her in and through her characters, who look into the camera or who seem to talk back to the spectator, as if both aware of their role in a film, but not letting any narrative conventions dictate the way they live.\n\nWhen we watch Cléo, one of Varda’s most arresting and flawed characters, we get to see what she sees, and the film becomes a record of the female experience. Her journey is a meandering one, as she people-watches, listens to the radio, sings melodies with her musician friends, and, most significantly, waits to find out whether or not she has cancer; but this film shows us just what it means to think you’re dying, but what it means to be a woman in this world, under constant scrutiny and preoccupation regarding image and appearance. Varda frequently and masterfully turns the gaze back at the voyeur, at men who objectify women, or women who scrutinize themselves, as we watch the protagonist Cléo watching her own reflection. “I always think everyone is looking at me, but I only look at myself,” says Cléo, rejecting the primacy of the male gaze, and guiding the camera and the spectator inward to her psyche. The mirrors that appear everywhere from cafes to apartments are further proof that we, too, are implicated in Cléo’s considerations of her appearance or all the death-related symbols she comes across. The boundary between real life and life on film is never clear, though perhaps it never needs to be. In one scene, Cléo watches a comedy film that shows a woman dying, and the parallels she sees are as much a reflection of her situation as they are of her dark, pessimistic outlook. If cinema is truly a mirror of reality, then we must see something reflected back at us as we look into the mirror; we think we’re looking at others, but we’re also looking at ourselves, and interrogating the way we look.\n\nLike the enormous figure murals of French villagers pasted onto buildings, or the cardboard cutout of herself that Varda has taken to sending around in her place, these cinematic portraits force you to notice them, and then notice yourself noticing them. As those tarot cards are placed in a row by the fortune teller, it feels something like the stars aligning for the viewer, as if every prior decision had been leading you to watch one of Varda’s films at that very moment. Even if you don’t believe in fortune or fate, there’s no denying that there’s something mystical about the experience of seeing all the layers of this feminist filmmaker’s art come together. Watching one of Varda’s films has left me marked, if not by omens of death, then by all of the life that she has captured onscreen—there’s always new ways to look and much more to see, and the rest of Varda’s filmography is a good place to start.",

        "text": "The Book of Henry was a film likely written 25 years ago or more by Greg Hurwitz and was realised as Colin Trevorrow's passion project. Colin seems to be an avid filmmaker and puts heart into his work, even seemingly attempting to give us Gremlins 2 with dinosaurs in Jurassic World. One of the big things that permeates his films, which always anchors them down, is a significant lack of emotional intelligence. Colin seems to not understand appropriate tone very well, or where things should fit in a film. This brings down TBOH massively, because by not making serious alterations to the existing script, or by not adding nuance to it, he ends up making one of the most infuriating, horrifying and terrible films of this decade so far.\n\nFrom here, it's ALL spoilers. It might be worth streaming the film, even if it is horrible, just to have a fully contextualised discussion.\n\nFor one, The Book of Henry has a very nostalgic \"Amblin Pictures\" kind of look and feel. The kind of visual style that The Goonies or E.R. would have had. It's very crisp and vivid, the autumnal look makes the whole film look very old-fashioned. The problem? For what they try to do, the story and plot are wildly inappropriate and don't remotely evoke the emotional response you should be having. The film is meant to have a happy-go-lucky tone to it, and yet, you have a story about a young genius who has trouble fitting in who tries to \"save\" his young neighbour from being molested and beaten by her uncle. He plans to do this by assassinating him with a high-powered sniper that he had documented on, and even learned how to use without ever actually firing it. He plans to dispose of his body by throwing it off a bridge and letting the river carry it away. Henry is eleven years-old and is in elementary school. He trades stocks and acts like the only adult in the house. He also does other twee shit like building Rube Goldberg machines. If you wanted the epitome of a Gary Stu, Henry is it. You could also argue there's simply no appropriate way to frame or film this script, but they went the wrong way completely, to the point where it becomes bad taste. The scene at the end at the talent show where it seems like Henry's brother is scattering his ashes on the audience (turned out to be fake snow) in order to \"bring him back\" had me actually blurting out \"what the fucking hell?\" in my screen - thankfully, only six others were there and some of them laughed, I'd apologised to the others after. Not even the most intense or disgusting films I've seen have made me do that.\n\nBesides making me act like an obnoxious idiot, the sheer lack of understanding of tone (which is reflected by the odd camera work and colour correction, as well as the score) makes the film seem crass. The scene where Henry condescendingly explains what a brain tumour is to Lee Pace, the doctor, is unintentionally shocking. What's supposed to be heart-wrenching and endearing is instead tasteless, emotionally manipulative and Zach Braff (it means pretentious and stupid). Who talks like that? Why should we believe a boy genius would do that? These are questions the film is too dumb to explain. This builds up to one of the film's key themes, which also happens to be disgusting and inappropriate; the physical and emotional emancipation of Henry from Susan. The idea that for Susan to grow and learn to become a decent mother, and to gain a moral compass, Henry had to die, she had to listen to his stupid murder plan, and she had to see the framed pictures in his base prior to pulling the trigger to realise he's just a child is horrid. It seemed the only way to give Susan agency, and it failed miserably. She could only live happily and raise her children after Henry died and stopped being the controlling adult in their lives?! If that's not the idea, then why do I feel that's what I just watched? Susan only stops acting out and being upset when she discovers Henry's pedo-killer Udemy course on cassette, and only starts acting like normal after realising what she's doing. Prior to that, Susan was coasting through life playing videogames, writing her children's book, driving kids to and from school while Henry micromanages everything else. She has no agency before his death. Anything serious that happens in the plot revolves around Henry and his Chris Hanson Jr. cum Hitman plan. This is just one of the major things that makes me feel that Colin Trevorrow doesn't understand tone or emotion. It's things like this that retroactively ruined Jurassic World for me, it showed he didn't make Gremlins 2, but a very dumb film that only holds up thanks to spectacle. A more competent director might have made significant changes to the characters and script to make them work better on screen. I would have kept Henry alive in my version, and made a film more akin to Rear Window where he's confined to his room and can see into Christina's home where he often sees her crying without knowing what's going on. Maybe the other characters don't believe him until his family start seeing subtle personality changes or attempts to hide injuries. You might then have a viable mystery thriller, even if it is a bit schlocky and derivative. Instead, we have something that borders on offensive.\n\nAnother major problem is that the characters are nearly all horrible people. There's a scene that almost made me walk out in shock where Henry's brother goes to Dr. Lee Pace to complain about a headache a week or so after Henry's death. His response? \"It's not your head that hurts, it's your heart\" - that's the dialogue done verbatim. For all he knows, that could be another brain tumour, but he just insists that the child is sad. That's stupid. If I'm that doctor, I'm gonna bring him in for an MRI, and if I was his mother, I'd strongly insist on it. What happens is Lee Pace carries on being ignorant like Susan. Susan is an awful parent and person. Besides not calling the police or security when a man is clearly abusing his girlfriend in public, or going over to interfere, she tells Henry to ignore it because it's none of their business. Henry is just as bad because he tries to justify a violent response by claiming apathy is the \"worst thing in the world\" and by actually trying to go over to stop the abuse himself. He's fucking **eleven**, how does a boy genius not realise how stupid this is?! Other examples of characters who don't understand abuse or how to handle it include the school head \"dammit Janice\" herself. Janice has heard a number of reports about Christina, and is even told again that she is being abused and Henry is a witness, but instead of reporting it she claims Henry doesn't know what he saw and that because Glenn is the police chief, it's not likely he's molesting his neice. She only realises Christina is being abused after seeing an interpretive dance. That is yet another example of how the tone and script clash so strongly that it destroys the film in a way I haven't ever seen. At least in **The Room**, Tommy knew what he needed to do to make a drama akin to a domestic tragedy, and allowed sparing moments of levity, even if the entire script is an unsalvagable disaster. The Book of Henry wants to be a 90s family drama and fails at doing it miserably.\n\nI've not seen a film as bad as TBOH in a way like this in a very, very long time. The usual \"worst of the year\" fare is unintentionally hilarious like Truth or Dare, or boring like A Quiet Place, or disatisfying like Rampage. The Book of Henry combines those three and adds more elements like bad taste, poor execution, horrible script, and Zach Braff. \n\nI suppose a question would be to ask whether there are trainwrecks like TBOH and is this the worst of its kind? Or am I massively wrong about the film? ",

But shortly after my friends had a long and crazed discussion about it and I'm confused.\n\nThe main arguments that threw me were: \n\n1. that the motivations the priest found were obvious and pre school - he Googles a bad guy who also insulted him earlier in the film and he doesn't like that so it's a just cause to do something against the tyranny of corporate power.\n\n2. Obnoxiously named Mary was merely there as a pregnant and weak women to save the powerful man from doing something insane. She was merely a construct of women used as a cheap plot device.\n\nI don't feel like I can argue with these points yet I don't feel like they're that important in this film.\n\nI found that the film was more a commentary on extremism. And how easily susceptible extremism can find us.\n\nThey have religious ideas and activist ideas come together in an argument that has no right or wrong answer. They don't disagree with each other in terms of logic but it's about value of life. Toller questions how he could've spoken better but as a religious man talking to a non religious man, there is little he could've done to improve. \n\nThat initial discussion scene between Micheal and Toller is grappling with Michael's despair and him knowing that he is going to kill himself. Toller doesn't know that but we learn that Micheal is either going to kill himself in a secluded wood or he will take out others in a form of extremist Martyrdom. After the discussion he decides in favour of the former. Which actually shows that the priest did a good job in counseling, though he could never convince himself of that.\n\nWith the mention of jihadism I feel this film is tackling extremism. And how in any form, whether the cause is just or not, extremism is inherently wrong. The cause and idea could be completely justified and totally correct, but the means in which we act can be found to be totally harmful and violent and wrong.\n\nI haven't even begun to process the ending of the film but would love to talk to people about it.\n\nI think this is a very interesting film regardless of whether you think it is good or bad. Would love to discuss with people.\n\nDisckaimer: I don't understand the flair in thus subreddit so if someone could help with that that'd be great - thanks ",

        "text": "I think Florida Project is probably one of the most powerful recent depictions of modern US poverty. Much of this movie reminded me of moments in Moonlight, such as having to boil water in the stove to take a bath. However, it bears more resemblance to Safdie Brothers films, like Heaven Knows What, in its chronology of daily financial struggles, literally living day to day and sourcing income from whatever means they can find. In fact, this element alone becomes one of the films most innovative qualities.\n\n\nAfter watching Tangerine, I knew what elements to expect from Sean Baker. Non-professional actors, poverty stricken environments, and characters who make really, really bad decisions. But where Tangerine rested almost all of its emotional resonance on the final shot (which, to a degree, was successful) Florida Project wears its heart on its sleeve. This is a difficult film to watch without crying, knowing the inevitable conclusion of the film and the failure of the parental figures tinges the earlier moments of childhood innocence with sadness. I am reminded of the endings of films like The Kid with a Bike or in a slightly older scenario, Manchester by the Sea. It is obvious that the parental figures in those films, and also Florida Project, are not enough for their children. Normal life seems like a far away dream.\n\n\nMuch of the film is through the lens of childhood, which attempts to ignore the uncomfortable realities of the environment. At a certain point in the film, the main character stops working, but still has money. And yet, in the context, the scenes of her daughter taking a bath with loud music on make sense, it just seems like something she would do. So does taking bikini selfies, in the context her mother frames it. It isn't until later that the darkness of the scenes and her mother's prostitution set in. Be warned, despite the emphasis on childhood and the amazing child actors, this is a dark movie. \n\nThe ending of the film clearly seems inspired by the 400 Blows. The children running away to see something they have never seen before seems almost cliche at this point, but in the context of the scene and some of greatest child acting I have seen in my life, the scene works. It is fucking amazing. You will cry. A lot.\n\n\nWhen I originally made my top 5 of last year, I put Good Time at the top. If I had seen Florida Project last year, I probably would have picked that instead.\n\nEdit: one other film I thought of that this reminded me of is Mommy, by Xavier Dolan.",

The movie was certainly epic, the imagination knows no limits, and the story of Chihiro's struggle is compelling. But while I can enjoy these aspects, there was the lingering feeling of emptiness, simply because of a particular plot point that set up the events of the film.\n\nThis plot point is the utter stupidity of the parents. From entering a dirt road that obviously implies that no path exists there to civilization, to immediately eating food that wasn't theirs, it's like their only purpose was to set up the movie and then go away. This particular thing didn't break the movie for me, but just because of this one plot point, I was forced to admit that Spirited Away just isn't the top Ghibli film I've seen.\n\nA little dramatic, I know, for a movie.

Its use of colour to denote the time periods was effective, and I loved seeing the gradual modernisation of the city.

        "text": "While on my first viewing I was submerged sensorially and emotionally by the film, absorbed by the sound designed and struck by the dread that was filling me while the unraveling of unforgiving moments was being anchored in my retina, I was on my second viewing more able to see the construct of the Aster's work, the strings of the puppet show ...\n\nI will propose my analysis of this descent in madness, show what I believe to be the author's intent.\n\n**Eyes Wide Shut**\n\nThe visual motifs that comes by the most is the one of the eyes, very often two circular objects that give a sense of strange lifefulness to the claustrophobic environment our characters evolves into. Very much like someone is watching other them. And while Toni Collette can give looks not to be forgotten, and nor is the one of Peter when his mother's scream fills his, and ours, ears while she discover, but we do not, the death by decapitation of her child.\n\nAs viewers, there are many things we will never get to see. The director shows it what he wants, and never can we look beneath the table, or above the ceiling, to the see the threads that are moving the shadows we see on screen.\n\nWhat Aster proposes is the dissemination of rationality into the screaming abyss of mental delusion, and to succeed in this, to trick us and make us unsure of what we are seeing, he is discussing it, making us adopt one point of view over the other. Testing that we could challenge what we are seeing, that we could come to understand what we are seeing is a lie.\n\nThis point of view is the one of Annie. At the very beginning, while the first apparition of the dead in the form of her deceased mother has taken place, she shifts toward us a replication of her room, decored with two staggering eyes, one on each side of the bed. This shift makes those eyes look at us, maybe we thought we were the one seeing but we are under scrutiny. And this also means Annie is refusing to see some things, is refusing to show us some things: what we are told is that we are going to see what she wants us to see, what Aster wants us to see.\n\nOne great thing being that Aster understand that he has no control over any of this either, he, the creator of the piece, Annie, is tormented by her own demons, the legacy of her family: daunting and profound madness. While she is extremely manipulative (and keeps secrets from us, that she is like her mother \"manipulative and secretive\"), it is also made clear she suffer from her condition. This is most evidently show when she destroys her reproductions of reality, that the little view of the world she built for herself is coming to pieces.\n\n**Behind Blue Eyes**\n\nWhile Peter smokes some green grass in bongs, his eyes are turning ever more red. Like infused with the nightmare, the light at first and in the very final scene, blood. While his familiars and ancestors are kneeling before him, he is himself blinded by this very genetic bond, and us the audience are blinded with him, bound to go down in the darkness with him in this car, where only red lights are beneath the shapes of land after the night had eaten the sun.\n\nA scene does parallel this one: while Peter was carrying her injured sister, Steve, his father, carries him too injured. But this time in the day, and while he stops to cry, to let his eyes shed some water on his face, two orbish traffic lights turn from red to green. And he does not move. This shot of him not keeping to drive the car may tell us that he has done what can't be done in the machinery of a movie, or an undergoing delusion, that is he stopped to move. Time is still, and in this step out of the flow of things maybe he can see more clearly.\n\nAnd so, as he gets home, he does not engage in his wife games anymore. When she shows him Joan's pictures, the only thing we are seeing is that he seems more certain that she dugged up the grave, never is Joan existence confirmed.\n\nWhere all of this is truly dazzling is that what we are shown is not what is happening. The scenes of spiritism are tricks. We are tricked by those very well crafted illusions, that make some sense because we ourselves are in a theater and we know we are seeing fiction, so we can believe what is happening ... And Aster plays with that.\n\nIt seems to me this interlacing of more or less truthful facts is all thrown into subconscious hell when Annie burns her husband.\n\nThe setting is perfect: in the living room, the chemine looking like a mouth beneath two square eyes, mirroring their room (the mouth of fire being the bed where all marriage is consumed) and so giving a sense of intimacy to what is happening. Annie enters the new room in white clothes displaying her attempt to convince herself, and others, of her purity.\n\nSteve represents the last wall, last critical forms of thought, to the terrifying scream from the abyss that is Annie's madness. And she asks him to throw a book in the fire, she can not do it herself because she burns, she desperately believes everything will be alright, everything will be fixed if he throws the book in the fire.\n\nThe acting is point to show how fallacious she is while not taking any emotions and depth to the scene, not break it, and the depiction of mental illness is severely accurate.\n\nThe fixation on an object creates a link, apart from the object itself, with the spiritism session scenes where an object is used as link to the deceased. In this light we can see that objects are links to the dead, what remains of them once they are gone, once their bodies is deep down the soil.\n\nThis is shown very well by a maquette beside the stairs on ground floor: the more modern house sits on ever more ancient owns, buried within the earth, the worms and roots of trees, family roots.\n\nSo what she wants to destroy is her link to the decease, that which creates her illness.But Steve refuses and as such he dies, she resorbs herself in her delusion, nothing we are seeing is real anymore. Night switch off to day, day switch of to night. Peter awakens to a pure nightmare ... yet what follows may not be his delusions.\n\n(And so, the last part I want to give a go is the family relationship in itself, and the great psychological accuracy of Aster's work on the matter)\n\n**Mother and Son**\n\nThe very first scene, in my fainting memory, where the supernatural emerges is that where the word Satony is discovered on the wall.\n\nIn this scene, Annie try to comforts her daughter.\n\nCharlie is definitely weird, from the physical appearance to the way she is, there is something odd and discomforting about her. Something does not sit right.\n\nIn the film, both Annie, her mother and her daughter end up being decapitated. So all females loose their heads, while their male counterparts are stroke by lightening, may it be the one of a match, or some solar coronation.\n\nThese parallel shed a new light on the feeling of intimacy that is created, the recurrence blurs the light between the characters: all women were crafting things, Annie's mother her carpentry, Annie her very rationalistic depiction of reality and Charlie more disturbed and childish toys.\n\nWhen Annie try to give some comfort to Charlie, she is comforting herself, and Charlie is speaking like she could: \"She wanted me to be a boy\". This weight of Annie's mother on herself and her progeny I think is the root of all the evil that come to rise in the film, all the delusion.\n\nFrom noticing this we could come to the conclusion all is happening inside Annie's head, and that is a true in sense, but is more accurate, perverse and terrific, to understand that Annie, like her mother may have well been, is inflicting her own delusion to her pairs. That she is creating situations as to answer her unrecognized, unaccepted need to conform to her mother's will.\n\nTo be a boy.\n\nShe will sacrifice herself, become the mad and destructive mother, to let her son rise - which in the 'personal theater' scenario would equate she becomes this male part of herself. That she has, as Peter remarks, make the killing of her sister happen, that she wants for this pitiful and weak, ugly child that is a she, to die. That the only member of the family that is exterior to this, that she has not planted her perfidious seeds in, is her husband which remains more neutral than her child, themselves bonded to the madness that runs deep within their veins. And that she demands a he, and so only Peter shall remains.\n\nAt this stage there is no right and wrong, there is no one to blame, there is no accurate depiction of reality, there is only some circus of sensations, emotions and visions. A swirl of mad giggling under the spell of possession.\n\nWhat is more sublime to me, that really concretise and allow the whole of this to come to a perfect end, is that Peter is the character the audience will get the most familiar with, identify to. That he is crowned for his delusion and us with him. That when he seems to doubt for a moment, when he sees the decapitated corpse and is taken by some nausea, a motherly and reassuring voice elevates to comfort him, yet only to plunge him in deeper delusion, in utter schizophrenic gibberish. Blinded everly by a mother's love and tyranny.",

        "text": "I just watched The Blob, and I have to say that it was as good as I could've hoped. The concept is scary; actually, it's downright terrifying. A constantly growing gelatinous mass from space that lives only to eat people. The direction is pretty good. It's a competently made indie B-movie, and the horror element is executed well. As far as 50's films, I haven't seen anything scarier. There was a point where I truly lost all hope, similar to the final scene in Night of the Living Dead. The cast was pretty decent, except for the child actor, who I just felt bad for. I wasn't around for the 50's, but if any film captured the spirit of the decade, it had to've been The Blob. All of this praise, yet when I search \"The Blob\" on the horror subreddit, it's always about the remake from 1988.\n\nMore people have seen the remake than the original, but it is odd that there isn't discussion about one of the best B-horror movies from the 50's on the horror subreddit.\n\nI haven't seen the remake, but I think that people tend to overrate movies with peak special effects and not take into account the technology that was available in older films. But I guess people are more into spectacle than things like good writing. It's absurd that many horror fans believe that the rating of a horror movie hinges on whether a special effect is convincing or effective. This is probably why a lot of people disregard the horror genre and create terms like elevated horror. A lot of \"horror classics\" like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have terrible writing and characters, but are hyped up to be great films due to imagery or effects. My point is that horror films can be great in spite of \"dated\" or \"bad\" special effects, and great special effects shouldn't excuse bad writing or other facets of moviemaking.\n\nThe Blob may not make you nauseous, but it is an effective movie. And, honestly, the special effects aren't bad at all. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on how important great special effects are in horror, or, more specifically, monster movies? What are your thoughts on the special effects in The Blob '58, in general? Did the remake completely improve the original, rendering the '58 version pointless to watch? Is The Blob (1958) underappreciated?",

Thank you guys so much for being a great community and allowing me to share my friend's stuff. Reviewed by Kevin Lever.\n\nBlue-[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/14/three-colors-blue/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/14/three-colors-blue/)\n\nWhite-[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/14/three-colors-white/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/14/three-colors-white/)\n\nRed-[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/14/three-colors-red/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/14/three-colors-red/)\n\n[Blue](https://i.redd.it/5oqgnnuyhu911.jpg)\n\n**T**he first in the *Three Colors* trilogy, *Blue*, a film by Krzysztof Kieslowski, is a powerful but intimate opus on the life of a woman who has lost those closest to her, and her attempt to piece her life back together by ripping away the wounded pieces.\n\n*Blue* opens on blue-tinged roads, the first sign of liberty, a highway before proceeding to the countryside. A young girl watches the cars out the back window, all those connections not made. A moment later, there is a horrible crash. The young girl dies, as does her father. Only the mother, Julie, played by Juliette Binoche, remains. Julie’s life is no longer what it once was. The wife of a great composer, she is forced to face a new world where his shadow follows her. And so she goes on a crusade to find any way not to grieve. In doing so, however, she learns to grieve in her own way.\n\nShe destroys the great opus that her husband–or perhaps she–had been creating as an attempt to shed that life. But the wonderful chorus of that work rings out as she tosses it into the trash compactor, warbling for only a moment before closing out strong. It’ll always be there, whether she destroys it or not. Julie even tries to fill that emptiness in her heart by sleeping with her husband’s best friend. He looks at her with adoration and love, while she just stares back.\n\nAll of these attempts to erase her old life only trap her deeper in the grip of her grief. Old keepsakes, like the blue jewels that hung from her daughter’s bedroom, and old wounds, like finding her husband’s lover, continue to remind her of what she’s lost. Even in her pantry, there is a small and lively reminder of her family.\n\nThe inability to move on haunts her; these moments of emotion creep up on her refusing to leave her mind. Her husband’s work still remains, like her grief, no matter the attempt to excise it. It is used only in fragments and its impact is sudden and commanding, as though it cannot be contained in her mind. Kieslowski briefly fades to black for most of these instances, as though the film itself is trying to block out its emotions.\n\nJuliette Binoche gives a beautiful performance. Even at the coldest and most distant, the character is still very real and expertly human. She plays the character with a care and kindness that hides behind her defenses, and over the course of the film, gives way to tenderness and resolve.\n\n*Three Colors: Blue* is a film about the reminders of the life that we sometimes wish to forget, but are so ingrained in us that is unreasonable to think of them as burdens. Some are, surely, but others are who we are. Julie faces this in every facet of the film, and it drives forward the great film that Kieslowski has made.\n\n[White](https://i.redd.it/9zghxxfshu911.jpg)\n\n***T****hree Colors: White*, the second in the *Three Colors* trilogy, is Krzysztof Kieslowski’s story about immigration, personal character, and success in business and of the mind. But it is in its more intimate setting, that of love and loss, that *White* finds its meaning. It may not all add up as well as the other two films in the trilogy, but it is still a great portrait of a man who is in need of personal discovery.\n\nJulie Delpy stars as Dominique, a French woman divorcing her Polish immigrant husband, Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski). He speaks very little French and has an issue with impotence. As their marriage dissolves, they are almost like strangers: his love for her is one-sided and boyish as she tells him in a language he does not understand that she does not love him any longer. And so he decides to return to his home country.\n\nKarol is put through harrowing cruelty after harrowing cruelty, never an ounce of decency thrown his way. His wife doesn’t respect him, committing arson to get rid of him after the divorce (she also publicly humiliates him) and makes him listen to her talk with another man over the phone. He has no money nor passport, and so his new friendships him back to his homeland in a trunk. He arrives at a landfill, only to have his trunk unlocked by strangers who beat him. After a while,  this character is worn down to a nub, and it is a little disheartening to watch him denigrated time and time again. \n\nEventually, however, he builds something that is entirely his own and becomes a prosperous and clever man in his own right. The way in which the third act plays out is cathartic for Karol but will leave you unsure of who is cruel, and who is capable of humanity.\n\nZamachowski plays Karol with a tender care, his wounded glances and heartbreak making his performance affecting and difficult. Julie Delpy, while not in the film for as long, is playful in her cruelty, almost like she’s having fun. Janusz Gajos as Mikolaj, Karol’s friend, is exceptional; his knowing smiles and deadpan stares create a character that is fascinating to watch. There is a depth to him that is hidden among Karol’s story but is a standout nonetheless.\n\nThe idea of language is a theme in *White*, as is the color itself. Whether it is the bust of a woman in the store Karol passes and later owns, in the foreground of his apartment and various living spaces, the color of the clothes Karol wears, or the first thing he is surrounded by upon exiting the suitcase in winter, white is in every frame. It is especially noticeable in the color of Dominique’s wedding dress, as a blinding white light comes down during a POV shot of her turning toward Karol and smiling. But it is in the flag of France where the white is most important. There it is the symbol of fairness and equality, qualities Karol is never treated with until he decides to take charge of his own fate. It is in emotional equality that Karol finds meaning during the destruction and rebirth of his character.\n\nWhile *White* may not be the strongest of the trilogy, it is still a worthwhile journey into the hearts of a man and woman desperately distant, and the lengths one would go to prove themselves worthy, not only to another person but to themselves. Karol’s journey from schlub to businessman to schemer is a troublesome one, but it gives him the drive to become what he always meant to be, even if that may not always be a good thing.\n\n[Red](https://i.redd.it/nrh4aiythu911.jpg)\n\n***T****hree Colors: Red* is a masterful film and the final film by Krzysztof Kieslowski. It’s an astounding piece of filmmaking in its craft and performances, in which two characters in a sea of noise come together and find one another through chance, or perhaps destiny. Kieslowski has taken the idea of fraternity, the final color of the flag, and turned it into a movie of emotion, care, and connection.\n\nValentine (Irene Jacob) is a model in Geneva and accidentally runs over a dog while driving. She returns the dog to its owner, an older judge named Richter Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who happens to be spying on neighbors’ phone conversations. This chance encounter becomes the core of the film. Another story plays out on the periphery, that of Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit) a recent graduate who is on his way to becoming a judge. He lives around the corner from Valentine, and their paths nearly cross on numerous occasions. The film cleverly does this in single shots, Valentine or Auguste walking by while the other is focused on something else, the camera fluidly moving us from one narrative to another. It’s a sign of connection being just out of reach, but perhaps not quite ready to happen.\n\nValentine’s own connections are in flux. She earns the ire of her controlling boyfriend Michel when she does not answer the phone right away while she waits for him to return. Her mother and brother need her help to keep the family stable, but she does not know how she could possibly help them. Her life is one in need of change, and a looming trip to England could provide just that.\n\nRed is everywhere in the opening minutes. It’s in the phone lines, it’s on the walls and the knick-knacks and the cars and the storefronts. It’s even in Valentine’s clothes. Red is everywhere, and Kieslowski uses it to create a beautiful canvas of striking color. It is most prominently in the photo of a melancholy Valentine standing against the side of a building, red surrounding her, an image that is brilliantly recalled at the end of the film.\n\nThere is an electricity to the filmmaking, a quick and dashing nature like the film itself is constantly out of breath. It has a pace that the previous two films do not, even when it slows down and takes its time. It is perhaps set to the pace of its heroine, whose life is always moving: in a fashion show, in a photo shoot, at a ballet class, at a listening station in a music store, at the judge’s home. Valentine leads a life of movement, never quite staying still until her conversations with Kern calls for it.\n\nIrene Jacob plays the role with a caring innocence; Valentine wants to do the right thing. Her convictions are at odds with Kern’s habits during a wonderful scene where Kern tells her of a particular neighbor he spies on. He points out the house and says that if she feels so badly about his spying that she should inform them. She marches over there, but when the door opens, she is exposed to a picture of devotion and love, one that she is afraid to rock in any way. Jacob is a warm presence here, a joy to watch in the naive but determined way she plays Valentine. Upon her return, Kern tells her of another neighbor, one whose frequency he cannot listen in on. Valentine’s reaction to the neighbor’s potential job is inspired, showing that while innocent, she holds injustice in her heart.\n\nThe interactions between Kern and Valentine are the highlights of the film. Diametrically different people, they view life through their own prisms and come to clash over and debate their worldviews. Each thinks they are right when perhaps both are right and wrong in their own way. There is no animosity to their disagreement, but rather curiosity and frank openness. The openness only goes so far, however, as Kern refuses to reveal the story of the woman he once loved, which becomes a sore spot for Valentine and strains their friendship. Jean-Louis Tringtignant is so matter-of-fact and calm in his performance that some might find it too subtle. But there is a heart and sadness to his loneliness that Valentine is able to unlock during their talks.\n\n*Three Colors: Red* is a film of fraternity, as the flag implies, but it is also about so much more. Human connection often happens by fleeting chance. That the film so magnificently uses this as its baseline is a grand finale to not only the trilogy but to Kieslowski’s work as a whole. Valentine and Kern’s lives have their intricacies, and when they come together, show that despite their differences, a connection is all it takes to change someone’s life.\n\nThank you guys for reading and Farewell  Krzysztof Kieslowski\n\n[ Krzysztof Kieslowski](https://i.redd.it/9p5ac1u5iu911.jpg)",

        "text": "I watched Room 237 a couple years back. I thought it was fine but I never thought much of it.\n\n\nOne day I DVRd The Shining and I got more interested in the subtext of the film. One theory I got really interested in was the idea that Kubrick used the genocide of Native Americans as a major theme in the film. After watching the movie about 5 or 6 times in a week, I kind of noticed a couple things.\n\n\nI think The Overlook Hotel is an allegory for the USA. The colors red, white, and blue appear numerous times throughout the film (as well as American flags), which is how I came up with the idea. \n\n\nThe whole film I believe tackles racism and sexism and the violence that occurs in the US from that hatred in the form of Jack Torrence (a typical straight [cis] white American man). In fact, one common criticism people have of the movie is that Jack seems \"crazy\" or that he hates his family from the very beginning. This could be a coincidence, but it sort of coincides with a sense of bias that people already have towards minorities and women (people different from them). All the \"Overlook\" did was exploit those biases in order for him to commit acts of violence.\n\n\nThe movie starts with Jack in an interview with the hotel manager. The Mr. Ullman actually looks very presidential and even has an American flag on his desk. They go through the history of the hotel and the tragedy that came about with Mr. Grady. Jack says something that mimics what many people believe when they are told of a tragedy that happened in the past. \"That is not going to happen with me\".\n\nWendy has a conversation with Danny, and Danny says \"Tony\" doesn't want to go to the hotel. Danny talks with Tony in the mirror and asks why he doesn't want to go. Tony shows him images of a red river of blood with the 2 twins that were murdered intercut, then Danny passes out.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gg7mi8toOuc\n\n\nIf Jack is the portrayal of the rampant sexism and racism in the US, then Danny could very well be a portrayal of a younger generation that has moved past the bigotry of the past. Throughout the film, Danny is seen as having a close relationship with both his mother and a friendly relationship with Dick Halloran (the only black character in the movie besides his friend that he calls later on in the movie). His relationship with his father seems to be strained, as the only time we see a 1 on 1 conversation with the two of them is stilted and unnatural, and Jack has hurt Danny before.\n\n\n\nIt is here that Wendy talks to the counselor(?) about the incident with Jack and Danny. More on that at the end.\n\n\nWhen they finally get to the hotel, they are given a tour by the Mr. Ullman and Wendy and Danny also go with Dick Halloran. The manager mentions how the hotel is based on Native American culture. There are very strong tones of cultural appropriation as the camera pans to show framed black and white pictures of wealthy Americans in the hotel (these pictures show up EVERYWHERE in the movie). The manager also mentions the construction of the hotel on a Native American burial ground. An on the nose description.\n\n\nIt is after they are showed the gold room that the group is literally segregated as the white men go off on their own while Mr. Halloran shows Wendy and Danny the kitchen and storage rooms. Dick talks with Danny and more on the nose conversation begins. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/2rKbtlodzCU\n\n\n\"Mr. Halloran, are you scared of this place?\"\n\n\"No I'm not scared, but some places shine, and some don't. The Overlook has a bit of a shine to it.\"\n\n\"Is there something bad here?\"\n\n\"Well...you know doc when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind. Say like, when someone burns toast. Maybe stuff that happens leaves OTHER kinds of traces behind. Not things that ANYONE can notice, but things people who SHINE can see. Just like they can see things thay haven't happened yet, well, sometimes they can see things that happen a long time ago. I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years. And not all of them was good.\"\n\n\"You're scared of room 237 aintcha?\"\n\n\"There ain't nothing in room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway. So stay out. You understand? Stay out.\"\n\n\nGiven that room 237 is where Jack is seduced by the hotel, it could be inferred that Dick wanted Danny to stay out of room 237 in order to keep him out of the clutches of the hotel.\n\nDick explaining how people who \"shine\" can see certain things that people who can't don't, could be attributed to those that are the victims of racism or are the perpetrators of racism (this might explain Jack's ability to shine as well). The shining could almost work in the same way dog whistle politics work in that only those that are the victims and the perpetrators \"notice\" these traces of bigotry from a time long ago. A younger generation (Danny) could also wise up to these more subtle hints of racism.\n\n\nAs the movie goes on, more things seem to jump out. The constant use of the black and white photographs, the native american feathers women wear when Jack is in the gold room. How the hotel exploits Jack's biases that are already in place by isolation (emphasized by the scene where he plays with a yellow ball while Wendy plays with Danny), lust (Room 237), and alcoholism to make his biases turn into full on misogyny and racism, as he calls his wife a \"sperm bank\", quotes \"White man's burden\" and uses a slur when in the bathroom with Mr. Grady. This culminates in a full on tirade against his wife where he talks about \"his responsibilites\" (Wendy is the only one shown to actually take care of the responsibilities while Jack is busy writing). He then attempts to murder Wendy before Dick returns. He kills off one of the 2 black characters and then attempts to kill Danny. He dies in the maze and Wendy gets Danny to safety. The final shot is the most interesting. Jack is seen in a black and white photograph with many other White Americans in a ball, dated July 4th, 1921. Independence Day, the year the roaring twenties started, a time of American prosper, all in a hotel built on a Native American burial ground, with artwork from their culture plastered all over it.\n\n\nJack's Tirade:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WFnCLenXkoA\n\n\nThe final shot:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Abey64kpZws\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stuff I found interesting:\n\n\n\nThe incident with Danny and his father is told twice. One by Wendy to a counselor, one by Jack to his bartender. Many differences between the two. Of course it's more telling that Jack consoles in his bartender instead of a mental health professional.\n\nWendy's retelling:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/g1tB_CSgWMQ\n\nJack's retelling:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HJVVGzEbJC0\n\n\n\nWendy seems to get a blunt object out of nowhere (baseball bat), while Jack inexplicably gets an ax.\n\n\nTowards the end of the film, when Jack completely loses it, he seems to embody America as his outfit is entirely red white and blue. Red jacket, blue shirt, and his skin makes the white.\n\n\n\nWhile in the gold room for the second time (counting the tour), Jack says he has money to pay for his drink. He checks his wallet, and says he's \"temporarily light\". He drinks it anyways. The next time, he pulls money out of his wallet ready to pay. The bartender stops him and says his money is no good there. \"Orders from the house\".\n\n\nWhile Danny seems to only see the horrors of the hotel, Jack seems to see the brighter side of it. Danny sees the red rivers of blood and the murdered girls. Jack sees the fabulous ballroom dances and is seduced by naked women.\n\n\nWhen Wendy and Danny go to the maze for the second time, Wendy races Danny and says \"Loser has to keep America clean\".\n\n\nWhat do you people think? Am I reaching on some of these? \n\nFeel free to talk about something else you may have noticed while watching the movie.\n\n\n\n",

Its not a perfect film and I understand why a lot of Star Wars fans wasn't thrilled by it, but I dont think it's nearly as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. \n\nThat being said, I do think a lot of people don't like this because its a middle movie of a trilogy and instead of continuing with Episode 7's vision, Rian Johnson basically did his own thing.  This caused some story arcs to be resolved shockingly early (didn't expect Snoke to die in this one, for example), but it also left a lot of elements unanswered (what is Ben and Rey's relationship?  Why do they seem to be so connected? Etc). \n\nWhere other middle movies like The Two Towers (Lord of the Rings)  and even Empire Strikes Back (original SW trilogy) focus more on characters and continuing one vision in terms of story, The Last Jedi does its own thing and willing to let the last movie put everything together. \n\nDo you think after Episode 9 comes out and completes this trilogy's story (and hopefully ties everything together), do you think people will ease up on thr hate for TLJ?",

        "title": "A possible reference to Lindsay Anderson's If.... (1968) in the Coen Brothers' A Serious Man",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8ylzd1/a_possible_reference_to_lindsay_andersons_if_1968/",
        "text": "I recently saw the Coen Brothers' *A Serious Man* and was re-watching some of its scenes when I noticed something very striking that closely corresponds to a similar move made in Lindsay Anderson's 1968 film *If....*, one of my favorites. There is a scene in *If....* in which one of the students is looking out a telescope at night and begins talking to Mick Travis. He says to Mick:\n\n&gt;Space, you see Michael, is all expanding, at the speed of light. It's a **mathematical certainty** that somewhere among all those millions of stars, there's **another planet** where they speak English. [emphasis mine]\n\nAs soon as he finishes this sentence, for a split second Mick Travis gives his classic cheeky grin and breaks the fourth wall by making direct eye contact with the camera. In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e80Uhbd4K84&amp;t=2547s) post of the film on Youtube, this moment occurs at about 1:25:09.\n\nThe similarity I noticed with *A Serious Man* occurs in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmjVqDdF6fk) scene in which, importantly, Larry dreams that he is showing a mathematical proof of the *uncertainty principle* to one of his classes. After the students filter out, Sy Ableman (who has died at this point in the film) remains in the classroom and begins talking to Larry. The dialogue here is confusing and doesn't all make sense (as is the case in dreams):\n\n&gt;SY: How do you explain?\n\n&gt;LARRY: Well, it might be that in, you know, in Olam Haba [\"the world to come\"]...\n\n&gt;SY: Excuse me, excuse me, not the point-- in *this world,* Larry.\n\nAt this point Sy Ableman, again for a split second, breaks the fourth wall by looking directly into the camera. He does this in a very similar line of dialogue as occurs in *If....*. Both scenes involve a dialogue with discussion of mathematics, certainty vs. uncertainty, and possible worlds, and the breaking of the fourth wall in each scene comes directly after this mention of possible worlds vs. this world. I have no question as to whether or not the breaking of the fourth wall by making eye contact with the camera was intentional in either of these scenes. Actors are very conscious of whether or not they are looking into the camera-- actors *not* looking into the camera is a huge aspect of illusion, so looking into the camera suddenly or unexpectedly is a very distinct way to disrupt illusion in film. Even despite this, one should in any case treat every aspect of a film as meaningful (in the sense that it contributes to its structure and form) and, for all intents and purposes, \"intentional.\"\n\nThe  question, then, is whether the similarities between these scenes are convincing enough to suggest that the Coen Brothers have really made a reference-- or at least a nod-- to Lindsay Anderson here. \n\nOf course, there's also the question of why any of this matters and whether or not it is worth talking about. I think, in any case, the moment in *If....* can provide at least interesting insight into how this particular moment in *A Serious Man* has a parallel in an earlier film, and into the function these moments play with regard to each film. The similarities and differences here are interesting. In *A Serious Man* Sy doubts whether the proof of the uncertainty principle is \"convincing,\" suggesting that \"Mathematics is the art of the *possible.*\" In *If....* there is no doubt of the mathematical certainty that other worlds are out there (although perhaps Travis' sly smile and breaking of the fourth wall is itself an act of cynical doubt). The title of *If....* and its fantasy sequences conjure up the suggestion of some longing for another world in which things are otherwise. On the other hand the scene in *A Serious Man* runs contrary to this-- Sy waves away with his hand all talk of Olam Haba and demands that the discussion return to \"*this world*\". If this scene from *A Serious Man* is not a nod to Anderson's *If....,* the latter serves at least as an interesting comparison to the former.",

        "text": "[Don't Look Now](https://i.redd.it/hccekjppjp911.jpg)\n\nHi Everyone because this post references numerous scenes and images I highly suggest clicking the link. otherwise I made this post readable enough that a link isn't required, but recommended for the full experience. Thank you for reading. [https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/13/film-frame-friday-dont-look-now/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/13/film-frame-friday-dont-look-now/)\n\n**T**he art of film editing is often, when done successfully, something that goes unnoticed. It’s a tool for filmmakers to stitch together entirely separate images, sometimes not even recorded in the same time or place, and fool the viewer’s eye and mind into thinking the actions they’re watching are temporally and spatially linked. If a character starts to stand up in a medium shot and the editor cuts to a wide half-way through the action, our brains fill in any missing or altered information so long as the action appears to match, even if the director and editor are cutting between take two of a scene and take fifty. We don’t even think about it; it’s like how our brains can read words whose letters are out of order so long as the first and last couple are where they should be.\n\nAlthough this invisible style of editing, or continuity editing, was the gold standard of classic Hollywood cinema and is still used as the editing style of choice for most major films that come out to this day, it wasn’t always the case. During the silent era of film history, the Soviet film theory formalists (Sergei Eisenstein and Lev Kuleshov, most notably) bore down on the idea of montage—not montage as how we come to think of it in a post-*Rocky* world, but the entirety of how individual shots are sequenced in a film—as a way to create new meaning from separate images. One of the principals of montage theory is that viewers don’t interpret images one after the other in a string, despite viewing them in that order, but rather on top of one another, compounding their meaning. When thought of this way, editing isn’t a linear task, but an exercise in addition.\n\nThe Soviet filmmakers played extensively with all sorts of editing displays that called attention to themselves (rather than using the technique in the Hollywood manner of making it invisible so as not to distract the viewers from the actors) to create radical new ideas in a purely visual way. For example, in Eisenstein’s 1925 film *Strike,* he crosscut between striking workers being killed and real footage of cattle being slaughtered. Individually the two series of shots would be horrifying but insensate; taken together, the shots create allegory, an intangible and intellectual concept born from disparate images.\n\n Enter 1973’s *Don’t Look Now*, directed by Nicolas Roeg and edited by Graeme Clifford, an adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier’s short story of the same name. It’s about a married couple, John (Donald Sutherland) and Laura Baxter (Julie Christie), who move to Venice, Italy to try to outrun their grief after their young daughter drowns in a pond by their home in England. The film is as much a portrait of how parents come to deal with such an immeasurable loss as it is a horror film (though its climax rightfully ends up on many “scariest moments in films” lists,  I find it to be thoroughly chilling the whole way through despite a dearth of traditional scares). More germane to my point, however: *Don’t Look Now* is a sterling example of the crucial effect film editing can have beyond a mere timeline sequencer, and in this case it blends tenants of invisible editing with more attention-grabbing montage principals, not just as a function of telling a story but as a method that is core to the story itself, because the editing tricks used throughout are motivated by the characters within the story. \n\nThe whole picture is ripe with little moments that conjure unease, but there are three major editing set-pieces throughout the film: one in the opening, one in the middle, and one at the end that distinctly call attention to themselves. These three noteworthy sequences all happen at pivotal points in the narrative, and though I’m only going to be discussing the opening scene in substantial depth, there will be spoilers for the rest of the film, so if you have yet to watch this movie I highly encourage you to seek it out as soon as possible, as this is a movie where the form is predicated on the viewer being in the same state of unknowing as its protagonist. And if you have seen the movie, or you don’t give a damn about spoilers, I recommend you (re)watch [**the opening scene**](http://www.criticalcommons.org/Members/kfortmueller/clips/dont-look-now-1973-opening/view) before we dive in.\n\n*Don’t Look Now*‘s remarkable editing style appears at first as merely an enigmatic and haunting stylistic choice, but is eventually revealed to be a result of John’s miraculous ability to see premonitions of the future. Unfortunately for him, he is, like us, by turns unaware and then disbelieving of his gift, and as a result of incorrectly interpreting his visions he is led to his death in the form of a grotesque perversion of his daughter’s memory. In a montage (this time in the *Rocky*sense) during this climax, John witnesses in a flash many of the clues he misinterpreted or ignored along the way. The groundwork is laid from the beginning of the film, though, and if you watch *Don’t Look Now* for a second time you are able to catch just how much the film lays out clues and omens for John and the viewer to piece together before it’s too late.\n\n Before the opening scene proper even begins, the film shows us rain pouring over a pond, which then cuts to sunlight filtering through a window of indiscernible origin while a man hums softly in the background. These images make no sense when you’re first exposed to them, but eventually we come to understand them as visions of the future, introducing the audience to the concept right away even when they don’t realize it yet. The film is never in your face about what it’s doing, despite constantly throwing presages of impending death on the screen. \n\nThe first shot of the opening sequence in England already has a visual warning for the audience: in the background behind young Christine, clad in her bright red mac (which becomes an omen itself), a white horse runs across the frame. Those keen on their biblical allusions will know that a pale horse is what Death rides in the Book of Revelation (or if you’re just a big *Twin Peaks* fan you can connect the dots that way as well). The scene then begins inter-cutting between Christine playing with a soldier doll and getting ever so close to the pond in the family’s yard, and Johnny—John and Laura’s son—riding through fields on his bicycle. Eventually Christine reaches the pond and the camera zooms in on her inverted reflection within (a nice piece of visual foreshadowing already), before cutting to a close-up of a burning log and zooming back out to reveal we’re now inside the house. This edit uses both a graphic match (Christine’s red outfit and placement in the center of the frame is a mirror of the fire in the next shot) and a fluid match of the camera zooms in each respective shot to give the sensation that the two images are somehow physically linked. It’s a disconcerting moment, because it draws attention to itself in a seemingly confounding way, as viewers will want to make a mental connection whenever a graphic match is made (think of the famous bone-to-spaceship graphic match in *2001: A Space Odyssey* and all the implications therein). The clues are there though because:\n\n1. Linking the watery image of Christine with the burning log is yet another harbinger of her impending death.\n2. This spacial linking is again a demonstration of John’s second sight. Notice how the camera zooms out past Laura, who is reading on the couch, and ends its zoom with John in the foreground, head turned towards the fireplace. This implies that John was looking through the fire, and seeing the image of Christine in the pond.\n\nThe cut that breaks us out of the Baxter’s living room and back out to the pond is another graphic match, again suggesting that the two images are somehow linked and that, by extension, John is able to sense that connection. The graphic match this time? John is looking at a slide of a church he’s restoring in Venice and he notices a childlike figure wearing the same red raincoat his daughter is wearing, leading of course to a cut to Christine, the camera still shooting only her reflection in the pond, suggesting a doom that has already trapped her.\n\nFrom this point the cutting becomes even more suggestive yet more difficult to parse. As Christine’s reflection runs screen right and vanishes into the grass rimming the pond, we cut to Johnny riding his bicycle from screen right (where Christine disappeared) appearing from behind a tree, and riding towards screen left. The film cuts between the two as it looks like they are moving rapidly toward each other, before making an incredibly jarring graphic and aural match cut between Christine’s feet running through a puddle and Johnny’s bicycle tire smashing a pane of glass, and another cut of John—still inside—glancing up from his slide, looking disturbed. This all happens quite rapidly and hardly gives the viewer any time to think about the images they’re seeing, but because of the editing techniques used it ensures we know that somehow the three scenes are linked and are converging in a disquieting manner. And just as the color red, and water, become omens of death for the rest of the film, so too does the shattering of glass.\n\nThe next series of notable cuts: John is looking at Laura and as she puts her hand to her mouth, there is another match cut of Christine making the same gesture, and then as Laura is rummaging around for something as John watches, we cut again to reveal what it is she’s looking for: a cigarette left smoking on the lip of an ashtray in the kitchen. A smile comes to John’s face since he somehow knows what it is she’s looking for, and as he tosses her a pack we cut to Christine throwing a ball she picked up, and as it lands with a splash in the water we cut back to John knocking a glass of water onto the slide with the red figure, causing the colors to leak like a pool of blood, and it’s at this moment that John knows something terrible has happened.\n\nBy using invisible editing techniques like cutting on action and blending them with the principals of montage of creating new meaning from disparate images, *Don’t Look Now* is able to at once draw the audience into its unique visual logic and disturb them with disjunctive scenes that when taken as a whole provide a grim new understanding. The symbolism that the editing imbues in such motifs as the color red, water, and breaking glass, provides a layer of sophistication to the suspense and horror pervading the film that’s far more evocative than more blunt horror films that rely on scares built around the tactile physical senses.\n\n The story of the film may be simple, but the editing conveys a visual layer of depth inherent to cinema (it’s very Hitchcockian in its approach to suspense, which is fitting since he also adapted two of Du Maurier’s stories into films of his own), as every image that Roeg and Clifford cut to is juxtaposed with the images that surround it and contextualized within the complex web of symbolism that is created within those juxtapositions. Suddenly every cut to a figure in red, a reflection, a body of water, becomes a specter haunted by the same grievous emotional wounds inflicted upon us in the opening that codifies the whole picture, and as such every close-up on Sutherland’s restrained performance becomes amplified by what we read into the images they’ve been paired up with (i.e., The Kuleshov Effect at work). One of those bravura editing set-pieces I mentioned earlier is a sex scene between John and Laura (presumably the first time they’ve had sex since the death of Christine) inter-cut with the couple separately getting ready to go out after the fact. Despite not saying a word, we are able to project emotional states onto their solitary rituals based on the juxtaposing shots of their love making. \n\nEach of the three major editing sequences is concurrent with an intense emotional state for John. The death of his daughter is grief, the sex with his wife is passion, and finally his own death is one of horror. Throughout the entire film we are made uneasy through the editing, but, if you’re like John, you will still have misread the warning signs and belied your vague sense of disquiet with a yearning for him to be reunited with what appears to be his daughter running alongside the watery canals of Venice. Shocking in both its perversity, and as an apparent non-sequitur, the child turns out not to be a child at all, but a wizened dwarf who grins at a shocked John before shaking her head knowingly and hacking his throat open with an immense knife. In his death throes we see all the clues we have missed, and the same images that took on one meaning earlier, be it the omen of his daughter’s death and the hope of her return, become re-contextualized as auguries of his own murder as they cut back to his distorted face, blood spilling from his neck in such a way that recalls the bleeding colors of the water-soaked slide from the beginning of the film.\n\n This sequence of the film is so scary for me because of how nakedly the film seems to be mocking both John and the viewer. The film plays no tricks with its editing; it doesn’t exactly spell things out but the answers are laid out well in advance (even the killer dwarf herself is foreshadowed beyond just the slide photo in the opening, as a series of serial killings plays out in the background of certain scenes, and even as a gargoyle John literally stares in the face). The smile and shaking of her head that the dwarf give before she kills John is her way of saying, “You were given everything you needed to survive this, but still you came to me. I’m not what you expected, am I?” \n\nBack in the opening of the film, Laura asks John, “If the world’s round, why is a frozen pond flat?” before coming to the answer that indeed frozen water is slightly higher on one side than the other to which John responds, “Everything isn’t what it seems.”\n\nIndeed.\n\nEverything *isn’t* what it seems. That’s the power of editing.\n\n### Written by Graham Austin",

There’s something about my personal relationship with my siblings, something that has always been close but intense (and sometimes frustrating), that is mirrored in the film. \n\nAuthenticity is debated in a way that recalls Heidegger’s definition, and the moods of the two main characters seem to play games with each other as they battle with the fatalism of this notion. Rather than dwelling in a traditional existentialist mood, an isolated inner conflict, the hallucinatory interpersonal relationship at the center of the film reminded me of Deleuze and Guatarri’s concept of the Ego in Capitalism and Schizophrenia. For D&amp;G, our practice of self is bound by the psychoanalytic concept of Ego. Rather than thinking of selves as discrete units, a gradient of multiplicity is what defines us: we are all of our relationships. this is why i don’t think it matters whether one interprets the film as depicting Alma or Elizabet’s  conflicting personalities within their ego or without: the experience is one and the same. \n\nthese are just first impressions, and i feel like i’m doing a the film a disservice by not mentioning it’s journey through gender/sexuality, religion and punishment, and especially it’s remarkable photography. did anyone else have a similar reaction when they first viewed this film?

Is it something to do with self-obsessed criminals?\n\nI get that Godard's trying to experiment with jump-cuts and stuff. But surely there's some logic to the story as opposed to Man steals car- Man meets woman- woman betrays man- man dies?\n\nLike what's he want me to take away from the story? And if he don't want me to take anything away from the story, then why is he being praised? To me then it should be the cinematographer who should be praised if story's irrelevant because thats the most beautiful part of the film?\n\nWhile the film's sort of enjoyable im confused as to why Godard can be put in the same category as Welles, Hitchcock and Spielberg?\n\nAlso I'm really struggling with Godard is there a more accessible new wave director?",

It was an immersive experience (though maybe immersive is the wrong word if I noticed it).\n\nIs surround still used, or is it just a lot more subtle, and are there recent examples of it being used well?",

        "text": "Hello, all! I recently watched Mr. Nobody and am dying to discuss it with someone. I watched the theatrical cut on Netflix twice and reached the conclusion that Anna and Nemo end up together, though I am not entirely sure how. I believe that Nemo is able to go back in his life after the Big Crunch and make choices that will allow him to be with Anna. This is also reflected in the red vase that comes back together at the end after being shattered. \n\nBasically, I have two questions:\n\n1. What do you think actually happened at the end--did the Big Crunch happen, or was it all in Nemo's head? And does it end with him being with Anna?\n2. Which is better, the theatrical cut or the extended cut?\n\nI have seen various posts throughout Reddit about Mr. Nobody, and many of those posts reference the extended director's cut, which I will be watching this weekend. I am a little worried because some people seem to think it changes the tone of the movie and is more explicit in what the movie is supposed to mean than the theatrical cut. I thought the theatrical cut was fairly ambiguous/open for interpretation, which I think is partly why the movie has stuck with me so much. The thought that Anna and Nemo don't get to live out their lives together is heartbreaking.\n\nJust hoping someone else is willing to talk about it, since I only know like one person IRL who has seen it :)",

        "text": "How would one see the difference or be able to see the salient techniques in how a director handles their portrayal of characters. For example one director may treat all their characters; lowlifes, criminals, artists or normal working class people without judgement/objectively or even with empathy such as Mike Leigh while some directors might have contempt for their characters such as (possibly controversial and there are probably better examples, but for the sake of an example) the Coen Brothers ***in some of their films***. My understanding goes only as far as the situations the writer/directors put the characters in and how these situations resolve themselves. So with someone like Leigh, life simply goes on for these characters and with the Coens, the characters end up dead or in a worse position then they were at the start of the film or the scene. So aside from the situations the characters are put through and how their journey progresses throughout the course of a film, how might a director show their opinions or judgement or lack thereof of characters in their films?\n\nExtra question - To people who are very familiar with the works of Michael Haneke, there has been debate on whether there is a layer of judgement on the characters in his films or if he has no judgement of them and portrays them as objective as possible. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "I was mindlessly surfing the internet, and I came across a discussion that mentioned *Rent* and *Wicked*.  It made me think of successful musicals that somehow haven't made it to screens yet.\n\nI am not a musical guy in the slightest, but even I hear of the phenomenons that are musicals like *Avenue Q*, *Wicked*, *In The Heights*, *The Book of Mormon*, etc.  There's zero chance I'll ever see any of these things soon, and for many other people all over the world that's true as well.  I would especially love to see *Avenue Q* after recently seeing the lyrics for \"What Do You Do With A B.A. In English?\" (oddly prescient for something written in 2002 and *The Book of Mormon,* being a big fan of Parker and Stone.  \n\nIn some cases, I understand that producers want to milk as much money as possible before bringing the musical to the big screen and thus permanently losing some of the audience.  However, *Avenue Q* has been around for fifteen years now.  *In The Heights* and *Wicked* are also a bit long in the tooth, although wikipedia tells me they're having adaptations tentatively planned for 2019 and 2020.\n\nMusicals seem like a sure thing as far as a movie studio is concerned.  If you're respectful to the source material and hire talented people to work on it, who know to stay faithful while also taking advantage of the unique capabilities of film, you can have a hot project.  The soundtrack will sell, in some instances you can produce a ton of merch (Avenue Q puppet dolls, Wicked toys, etc).  Fans of musical seem pretty rabid, a lot of teenagers love them.  It just seems odd that musicals are adapted after so long in their zeitgeist.  \n\nAnd apart from musicals, I wonder if there's any other genres that are oddly missing from modern films.  I suppose there's not too many martial arts films these days.  Hiring someone like Tony Jaa to do inexpensive-yet-impressive action stuff that can translate to different languages (not every culture gets humor and nuance but every culture loves to see bad guys getting kicked in the face) seems like a no-brainer.

        "author": "Carlislegendary",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8xuv1c/black_girl_one_of_the_first_african_feature_films/",
        "text": "[Black Girl](https://i.redd.it/z4qqbu4iq7911.jpg)\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/10/black-girl/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/10/black-girl/)\n\n **O**usmane Sembene’s *Black Girl* (originally titled *La noire de…*) depicts the tragedy that can arise from isolation and loneliness. It deals with ideas of francophone identity, particularly in a post-colonial African context. It is arguably Sembene’s most acclaimed and well-known feature film, and it continues to remain a notable classic through the Criterion collection. One of the few African films of the Criterion collection, it thus made sense to highlight its work and influence throughout cinema. \n\n*Black Girl* is regarded as one of the first African feature films made in Sub-Saharan Africa. It tells the story of a young woman called Diouana, who leaves her home in Dakar, Senegal to work for a white family in France. Once she arrives in France, she discovers that not only will she have to take care of the children as agreed upon, but she will also have to work as the family’s housemaid, cooking and cleaning without pay or any appreciation. Moreover, she has to live in a place where she has no friends or family and is alienated further by the colour of her skin as she faces racial prejudice and stigmatization.\n\n&gt;***“Is France that black hole? What am I here? \\[…\\] I spend my life between the kitchen and my bedroom. Is that living in France?”***\n\n The contrast of the film is in black and white is metaphorical for the contrast of race, illustrated by the opposing sides of Diouana and her white mistress. Diouana’s mistress often treats her like she does not know anything; as though Diouana should be grateful for what she has done for her. Yet in the process, Diouana has become isolated from all she knows and consequently becomes confined to the little space she has, as she remarks that her entire life is “between the kitchen and \\[her\\] bedroom.” Mbissine Thérèse Diop plays Diouana with the full range of emotion and depth required for such a complex, well-developed role. She completely illuminates the screen and says so much with the simplicity of just her eyes and body language. \n\n African culture is a large part of the film and the focus on Senegalese life, music and its cultural artifacts are significant aspects in emphasizing how much Diouana’s culture and identity are stripped from her. Oral tradition is a prevalent part of African culture and Sembene uses oral storytelling in a way that feels natural and personal. The film’s ambiguous original title being *La noire de…* which means ‘The Black Woman From…’ is significant in its construction of time, image, and sound. Juxtaposing sounds of Wolof guitar and French piano music echoes the emotional dissonance that Diouana feels. Diouana is thus displaced, without an identity or home. The non-linear structure emphasizes this, moving us back and forth between France and Senegal as Diouana cannot settle in either. The use of the French language instead of the Wolof language as well as the dubbing of the lead actress’ voice speaks to the character’s voicelessness throughout the narrative. This makes for extremely devastating consequences for the character as little by little Diouana is stripped of her voice, her agency and even her dignity. \n\n Sembene’s film is a stark and darkly profound look at interpersonal relationships across cultures, race, and class. It is a mostly black and white, short 65-minute film and is gorgeously shot. He seamlessly blends an influence of French New Wave whilst also keeping an authentic African feel to the story and construction of the film. He positions Diouana as the central focus of the film through intense framing. Constant close up shots and a narrative voice-over help form the story from Diouana’s perspective. The film can at times feel overly dramatic or theatrical and maybe a little heavy-handed in its final message with how dark Diouana’s story actually gets and how her story ends. However, it is still a beautifully shot film and provides an important and deep look into francophone identity in a post-colonial African country. It remains a great classic in African and world cinema and continues to influence films today. ",
