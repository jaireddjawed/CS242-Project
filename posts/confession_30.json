        "text": "Backstory: so I 25 M grew up in a small, but violent town in Indiana. Throughout most of my childhood my father lived out of town, and my mother was always with different men and addicted to different dr0gs. I grew up in a duplex unit on the west side of my town. Anyways the story takes place when I was 15 years old. I was babysitting my neice, and my nephew for the night, and once I put them to sleep I decided to go to the gas station for some rolling papers. Even though I was 15, I was a hothead, I had been arrested multiple times, and I daily carried Taurus 9 millimeter, which I stole out of a car. Anyways I go down the alley to the gas station, walk in, get my stuff, and I walk out. As I'm leaving, I check the time. 12:39. Those numbers are engraved into my brain. I look up from my phone to see a familiar person standing 12ish feet away from me, pointing a revolver at me. He lets off 3 shots and hit me twice, one to the stomach, one to the leg. The second I'm hit by the bullet, my ears start to ring and everything went dark. As I fall back, landing on a pile of trash I was hit by an adrenaline rush. A feeling I can't describe. I pulled out my pistol right as he fired another shot, but he missed. I fired 7 shots towards him, (The entire clip) and hit him 4 times, he dropped immediately which is when I went into the gas station, laid down, and passed out. I woke up in the hospital later that night. After spending a week in the hospital I was notified that the other boy had died (only 16 years old) and I was booked into the county JDC, and after 3 months of court it was determined self defense and I only had to serve 6 more months of house arrest for the possession of a firearm. Im so very greatful that I survived that day.",

        "text": "\nI met a girl through mutual friends and we live in different states. \nWe kept in touch, she seemed really nice and I liked her. But sometimes, she would send me pics of her “credit card statement” showing over 400k that’s supposedly her “credit card statement” all cut out and only showing the amount in the picture. She often said how her dad’s company is a multi-million or billion dollar company how he makes 10million USD annually and that she does his company’s taxes. And one day she said her dad could get her in Harvard MBA program by donating 250k or 300k.  And her dad bought her a condo all cash paid off. \n\nShe was a good friend to me. fast forward, after being friends for a couple years, she tells me she’s pregnant and that her soon-to-be husband is a law school student. I was very happy for her. She even said they went to Cartier together and he picked a ring that was over 200k for her. \n\nBut things started getting weird, the photos she has sent me of her pregnant belly didn’t make sense.  She said she was 3 months pregnant and she sends me a pic of a belly That’s about to be giving birth. I kind of felt weird. And I kept asking when she’s due, when her wedding is because she would sometimes give mixed messages saying like”i hope we get married “ or something and then she disappeared from social media. I was worried. \n\nSo I told my friend and said she’s sus. And my friend did some digging, asked me if we took pics together or if she had any of my info. \n\nwe found out she was actually 10 years older than what she told me. She was actually married to this guy on her county public records.  And the time when she told me her “dad” bought her a condo, she and her husband bought a condo with a mortgage. \nI couldn’t believe it at first but everything fit in like a puzzle. \nI no longer talk to her, but it was definitely a weird experience.",

Reason being that I remember it a lot more vividly now and feel a lot more anger and aggression. \n\nIt has given me an unhealthy obsession with wanting to get as big as possible and I’m starting to consider taking peds. I really wanna bump into these bullies now to see if they wanna try and bully me again because I really wanna hurt them. I have met several of the bullies since high school who have apologised so I have no wish to harm them. I have had counselling for this before and I know I should move on but I’m stuck with this unhealthy obsession. I guess I should seek more therapy.",

I went to the ER one night in October thinking I had appendicitis, nope, I was pregnant. I got an ultrasound to make sure it was not an ectopic pregnancy, and thankfully it was not \n\nI told the father the day after I found out, I knew he wasn’t going to be happy, but his reaction caught me off guard. He immediately started denying the baby was his and started telling me, multiple times, “I want you to get an abortion” and he would threaten to terminate his rights and that he would find a way to not pay CS, and would say things along the lines of that I would not be a good mom solely because of my age. And I had “friends” doing the same thing too. They would tell me that it’s “my body my choice” but then when I told them that I wanted to keep the baby, I immediately got guilt tripped by them and they would start shoving abortion down my throat, told me that they would not be there, even though months prior they were begging me to make them an aunty, but then when this happened they suddenly changed their tune. I was told about a hospital that would be able to do the procedure under sedation, I agreed to. Everyone was getting to me to the point where I would sit on the bathroom floor, just sobbing and went NC with my friends for a few days. I remembered going to the hospital for pre op paperwork, I had a gut feeling telling me “Don’t sign the paper work, you can be a good mom”. I wish I went with my gut. I confess that I wish I did not get an abortion and that I should be getting ready to be a mom. I don’t know why I did this, I hate myself for this.",

I kind of came from an abusive past, having a parent addicted to opioids, domestic violence, etc. When other neighborhood kids would want to come over I’d generally make something up to mask my parents arguing and getting violent potentially. Ultimately resulting in not hanging out at my house. This was as early as 8 years old I can remember. From then on it’s been this perpetual cycle, particularly with relationships. I’ve had women I’ve seen for months say “you’re a walking mystery.” I always felt alluding to not knowing who I truly was and that I was hiding something (I was). I’ve lied about where I live, what I do for work, where I’m from etc. To be honest…I’m not quite sure why as I have things going for me. I think it stems from not being good enough. I tend to exaggerate stories as well and tend to believe it in my mind and then I look back and think that was pretty delusional. My good friend says I should seek professional help but I’m reluctant.",

The last time he did it, he left the bulb in his hand as he broke it on the edge of the fireplace, of course it shattered. He looked up and saw me watching him. I shook my head at him. \n\nI told his mother, the child's out there destroying stuff. He intentionally broke a lightbulb on the brick fireplace. \n\nSo she gets up and she goes out there and checks on him. Of course he's bawling because he's scared that he's going to be in trouble.
