        "text": "I'm the DM for a 4 person weekly group that normally plays pathfinder. One of our players went on vacation for a few weeks so we decided to try a Star Wars one shot while he was gone. For those of you who don't know, Edge of the Empire lets you play as smugglers, bounty hunters, pilots, and politicians and play a Jedi-free game if you want. I wrote up a one shot and we moved on to character creation. \n\nI told them the plot hook was that they were members of the rebellion who have been ordered to look into a possible arms deal with a Mandalorian militant group and they made a bothan politician to handle negotiations, a droid pilot and hacker to get them there and through security, and a Zabrak fringer (basically a space-ranger) as a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. The fringer was decent with a gun but the others not so much but I had built in ways to get the mission completed without combat if they wanted to go in covertly. When they get to the mandalore system they are told that their is a bit of a problem and a small empire outpost in the system had intercepted their communications and needed to be silenced before anything else could be done. The outpost was on the nearby swamp planet Zanbar, known for its large, horned, wolf-like inhabitants known as anooba and man-eating plants, and was not well stocked or staffed having only 10 stormtrooper (mostly troops who weren't deemed fit for service in the core worlds including aging clones and conscripted empire citizens who didn't get very high marks in basic training, basically bargain-bin stormtroopers). The base also had a captain and lieutenant who unknown to the party had been conspiring against each other in their attempts to impress the empire enough to get promoted out of their swampy backwater assignment. Only the captain knew about the arms deal and rogue mandalonian group and he was planning to deliver the info to the empire on an encrypted infodisk to ensure the lieutenant had no way to steal the credit. The outpost had cleared out and hard packed an area about a mile radius around making stealth a poor option. It had a small garage containing a land speed and a tie fighter and a single anti-air turret was mounted on the roof. I figured these defenses would be tough but not impossible to get through for a small group.\n\nThe group was detected by the outpost before they could land on the planet but managed to not get identified as rebels and were instructed to park on a plateau about 50 miles from the base. They hadn't brought a landspeeder or similar so the trek through the swamp from their would take too long as the info disk was set to be picked up by a regular supply ship the next day. Instead the pilot rigged a simple auto-pilot to have the ship land itself after dropping them off closer to the base and managed to trek through the swamp with the help of the fringer and made it to the treeline perimeter in like an hour. To get into the base they made a plan to ambush a patrol by luring them into the swamp setting off a trap they set up and steal their uniforms. Unfortunately there well thought out plan was foiled by poor rolls and they were seen but just barely allowing the 2 stormtroopers to see bothan fur and zabrak horns peeking out from behind logs and mistakenly thinking they were under attack from anooba. The group went with this narrative and the droid called out for help saying he was being chased by giant horned wolves. unfortunately this sent the troopers into the swamp but not into the trap and in spectacular fashion spiraled out of control and into a fight leaving 2 out of 3 party members at 1 HP left each. They took the uniforms and lied their way into the base saying they had been attacked and had captured the droid and left the attackers as anooba food and made it into the captains office. From their on out the dice decided they had had enough successes (already a distressingly low percent of actions attempted) and the captain saw through their lies and ordered the bothan to remove her helmet. She decided to shoot him instead but missed terribly and in the shoot out that followed the group had 4 opportunities to shoot him before the base was alerted and they failed all 4. They finally managed to kill the captain but it was too late and they ended up dying under a barrage of stormtrooper fire. They accomplished their mission of keeping the mandalorian group a secret by killing the captain and destroying the info disk he had in his pocket which impressed them enough that they ended up going through with the much needed arms deal getting supplies to the rebels that allowed them to maintain there presence in the out rim but at the cost of their lives.\n\nThis game was insane, I've never seen so many bad rolls and I didn't even have them be terribly high difficulty rolls. They constantly had to think on their feet and adapt to the dice results and I think we all had a blast. Everyone had their moments to stand out throughout the mission and left it laughing at their own misfortune. This was intended to be a one-shot and was the perfect opportunity to give us all our first TPK",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8x7pjd/dd_5e_when_the_party_used_one_environmental/",
        "text": "Our D&amp;D 5e party found themselves in the Underdark, having fallen to the bottom layer of a huge series of caverns and being given a time limit to reach the top of the cavern or our captured allies would be killed by a mad scientist mindflayer. The party consists of a Dwarven Forge Cleric+Bard, a Dragonborn War Cleric, a Tiefling Hexblade Warlock, and a Wood Elf Warlock (custom archfey patron, she's a bit druid/ranger-y for a Warlock) - the last being my character. All characters are level 8. We also had an NPC companion with us, a Barbarian.\n\nWe discovered that the bottom layer was home to a Purple Wurm - a creature very clearly *far* beyond our capabilities - which was called to our location when we made a lot of vibration/noise. So we had to travel quick enough that we would beat the 24 hour time limit, but quiet and carefully enough that we wouldn't summon the worm and be killed. The party found an abandoned Drow fortress which contained a crystal that a spellcaster could focus on for 1 minute to fill the area with a dull blue light and project a light towards another direction, which would be a path that leads us to the next fortress. The fortresses were like stars in a constellation, and we had to go from one end of the pattern to the other. The Elf summons a Ptereodactyl to carry the party above the path as not to make vibration from running, and we set off briskly from one fortress to the other.\n\nEverything went well, for awhile. That is until we heard a telepathic voice in our heads - a deep, raspy female voice ranting about how would we dare bring a *surface Elf* to her domain. As she told us the stench of the Elven blood drove her mad, we saw a figure stir, backlit by the orange glow of molten rock in the distance - a large dragon-like figure with enormous swooping wings. The party figures out that we have a few minutes before the dragon gets here, and that she is able to fly far faster than we can. We might be able to make it to the next fortress before she reaches us, but we definitely won't make it to the end without being caught by her. At the same time, she seems especially dangerous and potentially also beyond our capabilities. So we hatch out a plan. \n\nThe Pterodactyl rips apart the fortress, throwing large chunks off of it to crash into the ground and make loud noises to summon the wurm. Meanwhile, the Dwarf knocks a hole in the second floor of the fortress facing the entrance courtyard - where the dragon is flying towards - and hides. The Elf summons two giant spiders to hide inside the second floor, while the Tiefling hides there as well and readies a Hex spell. The Dwarf readies his Enlarge Belt, as well as applying Sovereign Glue to a length of 30 foot long Adamantine chain which he holds in his hands. The Elf stands as bait in the center of the courtyard with a Dragonbane arrow notched on her bow and ready to fire, as the Dragonborn stands out of sight but close to her and ready with her hammer. Then the fun begins.\n\nAs the dragon approaches, everything happens in a split second. The spiders crawl out from the second floor and shoot web at the dragon, both of which land successfully and restrain the dragon midair. The Elf draws back her bow and fires the dragonbane arrow down the throat of the freshly restrained dragon as the Tiefling pops up to cast Hex on the dragon, giving her disadvantage on Strength checks (the exact kind required to break the chains, escape the grapple, and escape the web). The Elf flees to the side as the dragon comes crashing to the ground in the middle of the courtyard with a very loud noise, in front of the hole made in the second floor. The Dragonborn runs from the shadows and brings her hammer down on the head of the dragon. Then, with a mighty roar, the Dwarf leaps from the second floor of the fortress and uses his belt to grow to a large size category. He lands squarely on the dragon's back with the chain in his hands and quickly wraps it around the dragon's wings, tying it in place and letting the glue set. \n\nThen, at the start of the next round, the Purple Wurm bursts forth from the ground underneath the heavily restrained dragon and launches itself, as well as the dragon and the Dwarf riding its back - eighty feet into the air with the dragon gripped tightly in its mouth. The wurm proceeds to spend the next few rounds chomping on the dragon and the Dwarf while swinging its tail at everyone around it and falling back to the ground. Most of the party focuses on the dragon while the Tiefling runs through the building to get to the roof of the fortress. The Elf summons another Pterodactyl and boards it with the Dragonborn and the Barbarian, only to get hit by the breath attack from the dragon as it falls towards the ground. This kills the Pterodactyl and causes all of us to plummet towards the ground. The Elf, unable to summon more creatures, polymorphs into a Pterodactyl and picks up both of her allies in her claws, swooping up again towards the roof of the building. Meanwhile, the dragon falls limp and slips out of the mouth of the wurm, causing the Dwarf to fall directly down its throat as it dives underground. \n\nTrying to avoid another upward launch by the wurm, the Dragonborn begins throwing random belongings to distract the wurm. Sure enough, the objects hitting the ground baits the wurm up in those locations, and the Dwarf uses that opportunity to bring down the divine fury of his god. Unfortunately, the wurm manages to keep him down and dives back underground. As Tiefling reaches the roof, the Elf in Pterodactyl form swoops down and lets the Barbarian and Dragonborn climb onto its back from its talons, also allowing the Tiefling to board. Swooping back in the direction where we last saw the wurm, the Dragonborn continues throwing things and manages to draw the wurm back up. With a blast of divine energy, the Dwarf lets out a huge burst of flaming energy from within the wurm causing it to spit him back up as it dives back underground. He is critically wounded, but still conscious. The Pterodactyl swoops back down and grabs the Dwarf as he shrinks back to normal size and we fly as quickly as we can towards the next beacon, the vibrations of the wurm's movement getting quieter and quieter as it flees from a meal too troublesome to bother with. \n\nThe party escaped without any casualties, and the plan went perfectly - aside from the wurm arriving a *liiiittle* bit sooner than we thought it would. Nevertheless, the DM was left relatively speechless. And that was the time our party used one environmental challenge to bait out another. Probably also the highest I've ever seen a group punch above their challenge rating and come out with no casualties. We agreed when we decided on our plan that whether this works or not it will be a story we tell for years, and I think we were right. Thanks for reading, everyone!",

        "text": "A friend of mine had been bouncing the idea back and forth on how to start tabletop gaming. He knew I was a long time DM but due to scheduling issues we'd never be able to play together. That was until we learned we both had time during December of that year. When I told my current group about it, they all told me they had plans for then anyway but weren't gonna say anything until nearer the time, so this almost lead me to saying 'fuck it' and do a solo adventure for the dude inbetween bouts of movies and pizza...but desna smiled on me(or laughed at me, depending on how you view it), for this friend of mine (whom we shall refer to as Dick), had several friends who also wanted to get into tabletop.\n\nBefore I even began planning, I asked to meet them all, either as one big group, or one on one, or whatever. I met them all and during the three months between the first planned session with them and when I began my plans. Some I met more than once, even had to take one to hospital after they slipped and smashed their face on the pavement, overall I got a good feel for who they were, if not from direct contact, definitely from conversation with the others. This wasn't just me being nice though, this was a scheme that, in retrospect, was incredibly creepy.\n\nAnyway, they all showed up for the big session zero, unlike most session zeros though, this was a 'how to play' session. But, after that, we had the first, official, big night session one.\n\nThe entire party woke up inside a large, stone room lit by crystal inlays set into the slabs, depicting some sort of language or formula they could not understand. It was a little hard to make out details in the dim light though, and after a bit, they were let out by two men in armour, who mumbled something to each other before addressing them, telling them to follow along as they escorted the group to a large lodge beside this strange monolithic tower they had appeared inside. Inside the lodge was a man who greeted them and kindly explained the situation.\n\nWhoever they were, wherever they came from, none of it mattered now. The monolith does not care, and neither did this world. It was made long ago by beings who died long ago, and had been the origin point for the first founders of the people who now lived in this world. However, it was only humans who came through this particular monolith. The man explained that they were free to do whatever they wanted, so long as they kept to the laws and made themselves useful. He got a set of papers and proceeded to ask basic questions about them, like their name, their sex, and their age...This was when I handed out their character sheets.\n\nI had stated them, their IRL selves, using what I had learned over my time with them to craft it. As for their backstory? Their own personal history was their backstory. They were the characters in the game world, both literally and figuratively. For one, everyone got a great kick out of the fact some of them had pretty decent stats, and those who didn't (like simon, sorry dude, but you know its true), had stupidly good strength and constitution, but rather low wisdom and charisma, good int though. They also had additional ranks in certain skills according to them as people, like simon, who had enough ranks in ride to put him on par with a decent amount of knights in the surrounding area. For a big guy, he sure could ride a horse.\n\nFrom there they got to play twenty questions and the man answered most of them, but after the twenty, he tossed them all 100 gold coins, and told them to piss off. The only bit of advice he did give was that they should spend that money on training and gear, since the fastest way to make money was to enter into the merc guild after getting some training as a freelance. But if they wanted to, they could just become like some of the other townsfolk and live normal lives.\n\nObviously they said fuck that and all of them got busy training in their classes. The stats they had gave them a descent amount of wiggle room for choice, no one wanted to be a cleric or paladin though, so they were kind of fucked when it came to healing. The closest thing they had was Sasha, the ranger, who was training to be a doctor, so she had a metric-butt-ton ranks in the healing skill.\n\nFrom there, we time skipped to them gathering together and buying a small beaten up, abandoned inn on the edge of town. Repairing it wasn't difficult since another one of them had ranks in carpenter (I still have the wooden chair that guy made me), nor was it costly since they naturally sourced the wood, but the stone required set them back, as did the basic utensils for cooking and such. By the end they had about five gold each, which they pooled together for basic necessities like food. In the end, they suited up and went out hunting.\n\nThe way I had set the world up was pretty diverse, so they had a nice selection of monsters to choose from, no kobolds or goblins though, if they wanted to fight monsters, they'd be fighting tough stuff from the word go. Their very first encounter was a troll, which they only just managed to deal with by pelting it with firebolts from the wizard. They cut its head off, took some organs, and sold it all for a tidy profit, and for the next two weeks, we'd meet up every two days and have another session with them slowly going from low grade, poor adventurers, into seasoned veterans.\n\nThis really wouldn't have worked if they needed to 'get in character' every time, since some of them were definitely shy types and pretending to be someone else was definitely not their MO. But by being themselves, both in and out of the game, they really did get to enjoy it all from a first person perspective and enjoy the basics of tabletop. I will note however, they were all terrified of me from the word go, partly because Dick had told them my tales of woe and suffering from my table. Normally I detail everything, I plan everything, ensure there are story threads galore, but with these guys? I wanted a gentle introduction. They got what amounted to a JRPG style campaign, minimal plot, maximum character development, big varied world.\n\nWhen christmas came rolling in, we ended the game on a bittersweet note, after they killed an orc chief who had been giving them a bit of trouble, but at the cost of an NPC friend they had grown to love. Half of them I never saw again, one of them made me a bitchin' rocking chair I've had for a few years, and Dick recently messaged me asking for pointers on how to DM a similar situation with a group he's now running. It reminded me of this story, why I play tabletop games, and it just seemed like a simple, story to tell you all.\n\nAnd before any of you point it out, yes, I did get this campaign idea right from an anime/manga called grimgar of fantasy and ash.",

        "text": "This has happens with every group, they get high level, and after a while they stop taking creatures that could kill them at lower levels seriously. Kobolds, skeletons, rats, etc. So when my group decided that they 'didn't need to obey the law anymore' because they were way stronger than the average city guardsman, I knew something had to be done.\n\nTo the groups credit, only two out of the five had this attitude, the barbarian and the thief, both bolstered by the fact the king was dead and his son owed them a big one for freeing him from possession. They started by not paying for small things, but it got pretty bad after they demanded free nights at the whore house. Since they were dealing with bog standard humans as the guardsmen, they didn't feel threatened in the slightest, after killing a small demons nest in the castle, they felt invisible. Their downfall began with one of them strong-arming a guardsman into looking the other way while they browbeat the owner of the whore house, the guardman did leave...but he promptly returned to his captain to make the report and call for back up. As the captain knew the group, he told the guard to just watch them for now, and if it got any worse, they'd begin preparations for capture.\n\nIt got worse the day after, while they were leaving the castle after talking to the court mage about travel to the diabolic city of Dis. The barb just took some food off a cart and kept going, refused to pay, and when the man demanded it, the barbarian punched him square in the face and kept walking. He didn't kill the man, but it took him to one HP and destroyed his jaw, he'd never be able to speak properly again, let along eat. When confronted by other townsfolk, the rest of the group left him to fend for himself as he beat half a dozen more people senseless before leaving. The guard reported it, and the captain set things in motion.\n\nFirstly, the new king was implored for the use of some castle guard members and magic items, next, the basic guardsmen were trained in a very specific set of tactics and equipment, lastly, lots of very simple poisons. Each guardsman was about a CR 1, the castle guard being CR 8. I could have included the army (sporting CR 6 and 7 soldiers) or the royal guard (CR 11) but I had a point to make with these basic units. Only the captain was of the same level as the party, and he wasn't even taking part in the fight. Even the castle guard I had as back up weren't needed.  \n\n\nThe guard waited for the party outside the castle grounds, and just as they were about to enter, the captain closed the gates and stood on the other side. Saying that only two of them were under arrest for a host of reasons (the assault and theft were just the triggers, they had a long rap sheet). The rest of the group were free, but the other two would be serving jail time. Unsurprisingly, the barb and thief refused to go quietly...at which point they were surrounded by twenty CR 1 guardsmen armed with crossbows, nets and billy clubs (using dan bong stats). \n\ninitiative was rolled, the party won, but the rest of the group stayed out of it. The barbarian had cleave, but with the way the guard were spaced out, he could only drop one of them, same with the rogue. The rest began the plan. First, nets, they tossed several of them at the barb and thief to lock them in place and make grappling easier, Once a single net was on, those with crossbows would fire as many poison tipped bolts as they could, most of which hit since the barb and rogue relied on dex for their AC, but with the net on? they were flat footed. The poison wasn't that strong, and the barb shrugged it off, but the thief was suddenly wracked with this terrible sickness and grew very weak.  \n\n\nThe rest of the guard dogpiled on them both. The thief went down like a sack of bricks while the barbarian was able to keep four people off of him. Next round, the barbarian was only able to kill four more guardsmen before it began again. More poison, this time from knives as well as crossbows, the effect stuck, and the barb was rugby tackled to the ground a moment later. Both of them were choked out and slapped in chains. Two level twelve characters, defeated by twenty level one fighters, not even veteran guardsmen, just grunts.\n\nThey were dragged to the gate after being tightly bound up and drugged again to be safe. The captain leaned down from the other side of the bars and said something to the effect of: \"You might be big shots, but no one is bigger than the law. You're both under arrest, heroes or not, you'll still serve jail time, and you'll serve it as many times as it takes until you respect that which governs society.\" It's worth mentioning this was not the first time the thief and barb had been arrested.  \n\n\nAfter that their characters were thrown in jail for an extended period of time, which was shortened by the party forking over some bail money. They had to use temp characters while their other ones served time, but since their old ones weren't dead, they were given what i call \"penalty characters\". Characters who aren't as good as the ones you lost, usually due to being lower level then them. For four sessions they were stuck with one of the veteran guardsmen and one of the kings spies as replacements, and they finally got their old characters back, they never broke the law again.  \n\n\nIt's worth mentioning that just because they were given lower level characters to use for a short amount of time, didn't mean they didn't have fun. The goal was to teach them to respect the guardsmen, and lower level creatures in general.  And if anything, returning to that lower level and punching above their CR with the rest of the party who were on equal fighting terms with some of these things probably also helped strengthen their respect.",

        "text": "You generally get to meet a wide range of people playing tabletop games, and through them they can really change. Be it dealing with sexuality, anger management or even debating philosophy or cultural mechanisms within a safe environment. Yet I never expected such a simple campaign to have such a profound effect on a friend of mine. We'll call him Derick.\n\nDerick was a part of my group, there were five of us in all, myself as the DM. Derick was the last guy to show up to the session zero we always have to prep for the campaign, and got stuck with a class he had never tried before, the paladin. He could have gone cleric, but he preferred melee fighting and conversation over spellcasting and healing. The rest of the group was mostly set up and able to fill out their sheets by themselves, so we sat together and fleshed out his character.   \n\n\nAn important thing to note about Derick is that he was an athiest, even had a phrase that I still use to this day \"by hawkings chair!\". Religion was not his strong suit, but as a paladin, he still needed to be assigned to some god. We eventually went for a personal favourite of mine, Bahamut, but in the style of Paladine from the dragonlance novel series (don't worry, you wont need to read them to understand this post). The background story being that Derick's character used to be a guard captain, a very fair and well respected one who was one day bestowed gifts by bahamut out of the blue, but was not assigned any great task or quest, instead left to use the powers as he saw fit.  \n\n\nThe first quest was dealing with slavers who captured minorities from the city and shipped them off across the narrow sea to a nation that bought them. It went well, with some highlights including Derick telling a girl to stop thanking the gods for this rescue and to get herself out of there while the fighting still went on, and the parties dwarven gunslinger used a cannon to one shot the boss...Damn dwarves and their explosives.  \n\n\nDuring the downtime between quests, Derick had to browbeat his younger officers into not praying to various gods or show discrimination against any gods, despite the fact that he himself hated all deities, and still wanted Bahamut to stop giving him power, but could never find it in himself to do an act heinous enough to cause an alignment shift or offend the god. Eventually, after the second round of questing, he went to see the local church of many, a place where a number of gods were worshipped in seperate wings. There he spoke with a priest, a kindly old man in plain robes with a long white beard who sat down and discussed why Bahamut would choose him. \n\nSome paladins are chosen, individuals the gods invest themselves in from birth to guide them and create holy warriors in their name, while others gift these powers to individuals who already embody their ideals and simply wish to lend a hand. The reasons why vary, but out of them all, Bahamut favours the latter method the most, being a god who does not draw people to his faith, but instead lets them wonder in and listen if they wish and decide whether they want to follow him or not. Derick argued that by giving him this strength, and giving clerics the powers they have, he is robbing them of a chance to grow stronger through hardship. But, out of everyone in the bahamut wing of the church, he was the only one who had actual divine power flowing through him, everyone else was of other professions, with the head cleric actually being a sourcerer.\n\nHe still couldn't understand why bahamut had chosen him and given him this power, and while his discussion with the 'cleric' proved enlightening, it wasn't the full answer to his question. People visited the church for a sense of comfort, to feel safe and happy in the knowledge that something or some one was watching over them, even if that same god had no intention of protecting them from any threat outside of other gods. It wasn't the power and protection that drew them, but that sense of peace and assurance.\n\nTime went by, more adventures were had, and over time Derick was growing to like this whole paladin thing. In the end though, this was still d&amp;d, and someone was going to die. They lost the dwarven gunslinger to a backfire explosion that blew him to pieces, resurrecting him was possible, but it would take time and money, both of which they did have, but since a good chunk of this group were a bit 'fresh', character death was still raw and painful. Derick decided to pray while the church of many brought his friend back, but it wasn't a plea, or asking for a favour, or advice, just relaying everything and asking questions.\n\nHe was interrupted by an elderly man with short white hair in a somewhat tatty gray garb, offering him a glass of water since he noted how horse Dericks voice was (IRL, I handed him a bottle of mountain dew, poor fuckers voice was rasping, figured i'd wait til the right moment for dramatic effect). This time he was able to talk to someone who knew a lot more about bahamut, introducing himself as Elistan, a traveling cleric who wanted to stop in and see the church. They went back and forth about gods in general, how some gods exist as little more than an illusion to give people comfort while they live a life that would otherwise seem miserable, insignificant and pointless, or how other gods were there to be genuine presences of comfort, not doing anything more than simply filling their followers with this sense of purpose and security. They went back and forth for a while, until Derick asked Elistan why he followed bahamut, his answer was: \" He cares about everyone, not just his clerics and followers, even those followers of dark gods who spurn him have his sympathies. He would protect us all, but instead chooses to give the power to those who would protect everyone anyway, with divine might or not. Mortals must choose, or else they are not followers, they are slaves, with or without bahamut, a mortal will live their life. He only seeks to make life easier spiritually, for denying them hardship denies growth, and without growth through hardship, they will stagnate and die. I follow him because he helps us grow, his teachings are guides, not rules. Those who ask him for strength often do not receive it, but the act of asking alone can be enough to help a man push that extra mile, I am simply an extension of that, one man helping other men grow.\"  \n\n\nThey went on for a bit longer before eventually breaking off and going their separate ways. The conversation itself broken up between jumping up between different players getting screen time and the actual resurrection, but Derick got the most of my focus that night as I was using the time the others were goofing off to properly formulate proper responses.\n\nTwo more sessions pass before Derick asks me a favour. We normally held sessions in the late afternoon, but on weekends, we do it at around lunch til whenever we felt like. After the game, Derick asked if I could drive him somewhere, offering to pay me for the fuel plus a little extra. I took him up on the offer and we headed out, he wanted to go to a church. I went to a big one in town that was pretty quiet, and while we were there, we talked, not as Elistan and his character, but friend to friend. We were both Athiest, so the two of us talking about faith in a church was really odd, but it was pretty insightful. I know why I don't believe in religion, but I was happy for anyone else to believe so long as no one died over it. But Derick was rolling it all over in his head, and while I tried to rationalize belief in a higher being, he saw the logic in it and decided to try and believe.  \n\n\nHe didn't convert to any faith, becoming more agnostic instead of a hard-line believer. But he stopped coming to games on sunday, and eventually went on a trip to the east to visit some temples, I have seen him since, doesn't wear a cross or anything, but I could really feel the difference. Not sure what he could sense about me, but I was glad he seemed happier.",

        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8nmcyq/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_7/), Alistair recovered enough from his daze to answer the door to Rachel, and after some playful back and forth, it’s his turn to catch up with Principal Langford (and ask him numerous questions about what Langford is) before catching up with Sean and Kayla just before the three attend their various after school activities. That night, Alistair hits the beach to try and unlock his full power, succeeding, and then having a chat with Sean, Kayla and Voltaic Vanguard after waking from his coma.\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the seventh session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure*:\n\nThe trio start the Friday morning off the usual way; breakfast accompanying Alistair and Sean’s bickering while Kayla tinkers with some tech she has on hand. Not long after, the three head to class with a good number of the students eyeing them up after not only the Max Predator Incident, but also the light show Alistair puts on.\n\nTaking their seats, Agent Halo wanders in and formally announces to the class the Powers Display happening the following week and the Homecoming Dance the week after, including costumes and code names which the class universally find very pleasing.\n\nAfter a short bit of conversation the bell tolls and the group have to head to their first class of the day.\n\nGym.\n\nResigned to their fate, the class head out to the track field to meet their teacher, who stands in front of a pile of boxes, each filled with various weights. It was an odd notion, but Golden Conqueror was more than happy to explain.\n\n“Alright, listen up,” she began, “can’t do much in the way of anything without some cardio, so I’m going to be breaking all of you in with a nice jog. You’re going to be not using your powers and doing laps around the track field. Whenever you finish a lap, you’re going to grab five kilos worth of weight from these boxes, and doing another lap with it. You’ll keep going until you can’t go any further or the hour’s up. Got it?”\n\nThe class gave a silent nod, but of course, understanding and enthusiasm were two different things. To help with that, Golden Conqueror continued.\n\n“And if I catch you using your powers, and I can assure you I am very good at that,” she leaned in closer to emphasise the threat, “I’ll triple the weight you have to pick up each lap. Got it?”\n\nLining up on the starting point, their ever imposing teacher gave the signal and the class surged forwards. For the most part, all the players withstood the first three laps of the course without much incident, being called for escalating fortitude saves as they carried on and taking a level or two of fatigue. Kayla did very well, considering their negative score in fortitude saves, before rolling a critical failure on lap four and simply collapsing on the spot. GC flew over, dragged her onto her feet and explained that it was best to walk around slowly rather than lay down when out of breath.\n\nIn that same sense, Sean and Alistair did admirably alongside Pierre, Freddy, Gar and surprisingly Jose, withstanding the laps until the end of the lesson, though not comfortably by any stretch; earning a couple of levels of fatigue while being berated by Golden Conqueror, who kept saying how they did this with tons back on Graxia. As the group of teens gasped for air, GC put away the last of the weights and turned to regard the students. She offered a little motivation and recognition, though it was quashed when she reminded the class about there being another lesson next week.\n\nThe group continue on with classes as normal, meeting with Jose, Cara and a still recovering Jonathan at lunch. Cara reminds the group of their journey to the Mall tomorrow, and through the need of getting groceries, Alistair is coerced into coming along. As the group discuss the Powers Display, Alistair asks who might be participating in the fighting tournament, at which Jonathan raises a tired arm. Alistair shakes his cold hand in wishing him luck, and departs while once again accusing him of vampirism.\n\nBefore the group split up to return to class, they discussed returning to the Mall the weekend before the dance to get parts for costumes, or just to hang out again and an agreement is made.\n\nAfter class, Alistair returns to the beach to do some cardio training, and while there runs into Rachel. The two discuss Alistair’s lightshow the previous night and Rachel’s own destructive power, in addition to the fight with Max Predator. Alistair then tries to convince Rachel of Jonathan’s vampirism, to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, Sean meets with Freddy in the chemistry lab as Freddy makes more of his special pills he uses to fuel his powers. With some discussion, Freddy reveals that his parents were both researchers with the CDC, and their expertise let them understand the nature of Freddy’s ability, that his digestive system functioned almost like a combustion engine. Sean, impressed by this, asks Freddy for help in finding foods that would help mitigate Sean’s own metabolism.\n\nAfter a good night’s rest and a decent breakfast, the group head down to the Danger Room to meet with Andrew for the Saturday club, and they are soon join by Tila. Heading in and meeting Smythe, it’s determined that they could generate a hypothetical combat scenario for Alistair to fight in, and the group secretly discuss what they could throw at the moody wind boi. Eventually, Kayla settles on something she feels with suitable and sets to work manipulating the machine.\n\nAfter a brief period of waiting, Alistair watches the clean metallic dome around him dissolve into a cramped hospital space with flickering lights and no civilians. He’s presented with the objective of finding a civilian and getting them out of the building. Using his aerokinesis to still the air, he moves forward stealthily, eventually finding a woman huddled in a room where the walls and ceiling are covered in this odd biomass. The woman seems to be bound by this same biomass, and upon seeing this, Alistair asks if they put him in Silent Hill, to which Kayla says no with a sinister smile.\n\nWithout stepping into the room, Alistair speaks to the hostage and asks questions, and the hostage themselves manages to whimper out that it was a monster that took her and it’ll eat her. Viewing how high up he was in the window, before tending to the hostage. He makes a perception check to notice the sounds of things moving through the air vents before he grabs the woman and proceeds, with two attempts to burst through the window with the hostage and descend the ten stories down.\n\nOn the way down, he turns to face his exit and sees this shiny, spindly chitinous creature with a long pointed tail and elongated head clamber out the window and make an immediate dive at Alistair. It rakes its claws across Alistair’s back before landing and as Alistair lands, he puts the hostage down and initiative is rolled.\n\nThankfully for Alistair, none of his attacks are designed to rupture or cut, keeping him safe from the Xenomorph’s acidic blood, and he uses his control over airpressure to keep his sound-based opponent off guard. The Xenomorph is, however, very tough, and weathers the brit’s attacks until he rolls poorly and Alistair launches the thing into the stratosphere with an Air Launcher, chasing it and forcing it to the ground with an Air Cannon.\n\nThe simulation fades out, and the group debrief Alistair on the simulation while Andrew contemplates the next challenge.\n\n[We’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/95ga01/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_9/)",

        "text": "     Warning: suuuper long story. (Although I think its worthwhile). Also everybody was cool with all the stuff that happened in the game. (the PC vs PC death was something we both wanted and was hyped up for a while. We koo.)\n\n      Just finished my first ever campaign with my lawful evil duergar (grey dwarf) arcane trickster. This is the adventure from his perspective. \n\n     The story:\n\nFargrim has always been the outcast. Growing up, he spent his time hiding from his peers, researching the history of his clan, the world, and tbe secrets of the arcane. This did not sit well in a society of hardworking slavers who value strength and grit above all else. They brutally tortured Fargrim and exiled him for his laziness. \n\nYears later, in a group of adventurers, on a quest for power, Fargrim took out his frustration and resentment on anything he can, including a poor goblin named George. Fargrim enslaved George and basically brainwashed him. He relished in the power he had over George and thought about \"recruiting\" some more lost souls to his cause. Tommy is a young spirited orphaned human boy who seemed like easy prey for Fargrim. Unfortuately for Fargrim, Tommy is as stubborn as they come, and even more fearless. These are attributes that do not a great slave make. Fargrim had George do extreme things to Tommy that brought back extremely painful memories. With the unfamiliar feeling of regret weighing heavy on Fargrim's heart, he left Tommy, starting to realise the real reason why it was so great to have George. George was totally committed to Fargrim and loved him. Fargrim could always trust George no matter what.\n\nSoon after, there was some PC on PC action, when Fargrim killed the paladin of the group in self defence, after being attacked (albeit not without provocation). Needless to say, Fargrim was not the most trustworthy member of the group at this point. In fact, he even left the group (mostly by choice), only to join back up with them later with the knowledge that the Lich of Shadows would soon end the world or something along those lines. This is also around the time that two new PC's joined the party, one of whom would be pivotal in Fargrim's development. Cyrus McAllister was a young reckless human fighter with a familiar fearless fighting spirit. \n\nSo the group continued on, eventually collecting the three magic items that assembled together to make the Heart of Enden, an op magic item we later dubbed the DM sword (basically whatever you want to happen happens but there are some limitations and caveats). Fargrim was the only character who knew how the fully assembled sword worked, and conveniently the first to get his greasy fingers on it. \n\nThe lich then contacted Fargrim, told him her plan to reset the world to bring it back to order, and invited him to a liching ceremony in 30 days (before the world ended), since he had the will to weild the heart. Fargrim, having grown fond of his group was torn. He was attracted to the power that the lich offered, but through his slaving excapades and after having weilded the DM sword, he recognized that power isn't everything. It also should be noted that the lich seemed to approach Fargrim as a maternal teacherlike figure to reasonable effect (at least in his point of view). \n\nTo sort out all this information, Fargrim decided to set up a test for his companions. On one side, some gross flying manta ray things would be attacking him, while on the other, another manta ray thing would be struggling to fly away with the Heart of Enden. The other players would have to choose what they value more.\n\nCyrus was the only character who definitively came to Fargrim's protection. Fargrim's test was complete and he knew now that he couldn't leave Cyrus to a dying world.\n\nWhen they were alone, Fargrim asked Cyrus what he wanted, which is to kill powerful evil things. So using the Heart of Enden, Fargrim brought back a previously encountered dragon and had it chained down and muzzled in front of Cyrus. After Cyrus expressed that its only fun in a fair fight, Fargrim freed the dragon, shrunk it down to Cyrus size, and the two duked it out. Cyrus easily gained the upper hand and the dragon began to fly away, but Fargrim had one more trick up his sleeve. Since all liches that the Lich of Shadows \"created\" must have weilded the Heart of Enden, Fargrim gave Cyrus the heart to finish off the escaping dragon. Cyrus did that. Cyrus also teleported the party to the Lich of Shadows. Chaos ensued.\n\nUpon arrival in the Lich of Shadow's castle, Fargrim requested that Cyrus also be granted lichdom. The lich responded with her own test. Whoever was the last man standing in a battle royal would be crowned a lich along with her possy (including Fargrim).\n\nA lot of fighting happened, the lich was weakened, and she instructed Fargrim to take her phylactery and make a break for it so that she could come back another day. Just a moment later, Cyrus flew at the lich, attacking her head on and was instantly vaporized. Again Fargrim was torn. There were only ever two people whom he could fully trust. Now both were dead. And the lich killed one. There was nothing left in this world for him. Fargrim approached the philactory as the bard managed to finish off the lich (for now), before going down himself. The barbarian cut down the last other party member. With only the two left, Fargrim destroyed the philactory.\n\nWith the all too familiar feeling of regret weighing heavy on Fargrim's heart, he made his way to a portal that took him and his companion off of the demiplane they called home and to the prime material plane. There, Fargrim founded an Adventurer's Academy that taught the importance of trust and loyalty to you companions, no matter what. Now Fargrim continues to adventure, always looking out for a way to contact, and hopefully bring back his old friends.",

Most of whom have never seen a 20-sided die before. Cool, should be easy to keep them occupied.\n\n────────\n\nCampaign centers on the southern face of the Spine of the World, in a Deadwood-like mining town. West of Mirabar about a weeks' ride, along the River Mirar, the town of Broken Spear has stood as a defiant human stronghold and important mining outpost for three generations.\n\nBut Count Reinhard Van Der Zee is dead. His holdings are in locked in a legal quagmire, their ownership contested by The Summit Trading Company and the corrupt Zevek family out of Luskan. To that end, Whitewater Security Limited, a mercenary company owned by the eldest Zevek brother, has deployed a company of troops to Broken Spear to \"maintain order.\"\n\n────────\n\nSo far, they've been fairly successful figuring out how to play.\n\nSession 1: Made friends with an aarocakra tribe, then ambushed a Whitewater supply caravan in a mountain pass and murdered everyone, including an apprentice 3rd lvl necromancer. \n\nSession 2: Met the Van Der Zee heir apparent, made friends. Stole the deeds and hidden will back from the corrupt Zevek brother running Broken Spear, and massacred the company captain and his remaining squad in the streets, leaving their bodies burning in a pile in front of their makeshift barracks. Sent a strong message, I'd say.\n\nThird session: Now 3rd level, have a Four elements monk, a Zealot barbarian, a GWM Champion fighter, and an Archfey patron Chain warlock.\n\n────────\n\nGroup is sent to recruit the local human mining clan and former ally to the Van Der Zees, Clan McCormaigh. The elder McCormaigh apparently has been fighting a holding action against Whitewater and Summit. However, his daughter was kidnapped, and it appears as though a ransom situation is developing.\n\nGroup arrives, starts to get drunk. The Zealot smells something wrong whilst drinking his first mead in the Clan longhouse, though.\n\nWarlock rushes out, his raven familiar flies out to pull an ISR soak of the immediate area.\n\nFlimsy wood stockade just north of longhouse is overrun with skeletons.\n\nohsnap.jpg\n\nBarb and fighter rush the breach. 1/2CR skellies fall like wheat to a scythe.\n\nUAV operator warlock spies a necromancer on a hill 60ft from breach. Paints target for the monk, starts casting thru familiar to suppress the caster.\n\nNecro is a 12th lvl necromancer, so can mass summon skellies, and is generally OP af\n\nGroup doesn't care. Neither do the dice.\n\nNecro is also cult leader for a cult of Orcus, so can't die of lethal damage, and has aura of negative energy.\n\nLock breaks necro's concentration in 2nd round with a witch bolt, ending his mass summoning ritual. \n\nMonk is in heat-seeking missile mode, cheetah flips the stockade and runs remaining 60 ft using step with wind. Attacks to grapple and knocks down the necro. Barb and Fighter decide to keep mowing the lawn. 19-20 crit and added attack on kills is OP against skellies.\n\nMonk beats necro like redheaded stepchild. Lock uses shocking grasp thru raven. Fighter and barb decide to ignore 5 attacks of opportunity each and rush the necromancer. None hit. \n\nWtf.jpg\n\nNecro has a contingency dimension door that triggers at 50% health. It triggers now.\n\nNecro finally gets up and lunges for the portal. Triggers attacks of opportunity from everyone. Barbarian and fighter even managed to get to him this round.\n\nBarbarian crits, attacks again, crits again, triggers Orcus blessing, hits again to kill him. #BeastMode\n\nBody falls through door anyway, into a dark room on other side.\n\nFighter and barbarian decide to jump through anyway.\n\nSince caster is dead, dimension door concentration is broken and door shuts. Oops.\n\nFighter and barbarian decide to murderhobo through this cult leader's home base. \n\nFind bag of holding, fill it with everything not bolted down.\n\nSearch the halls of this abandoned underground temple. Find a room with lots of glittering gems on floor.\n\nThose aren't gems.\n\nFour centipede-grick hybrids nest in here. Acid spit, tentacle attacks, and a nasty bite.\n\nFighter and barbarian say, \"we can take 'em!\"\n\nThey couldn't.\n\nKill all but one, but both go down.\n\nParty finds them a day later, while searching for the clan leader's daughter. \n\ntaps plays\n\n────────\n\n────────\n\nTL;DR, that necromancer was my BBEG, and he got beat like he owed them money. Never create a BBEG that you can't replace. Always have a \"bigger fish.\"",

        "text": "When we last left them...\n\n&gt; Nez, wearing his human cultist disguise,  turns back to the door and with a mighty heave, lifts the solid iron bar blocking the door.  The party hurries in, closing the door behind them.  They are surrounded by villagers, some holding farming implements, some holding children, all afraid.  \n\n&gt; The temple has a large alter near the rear, opening out into the main seating area and to a triple archway.  This leads to a vestibule ending in a 10-foot square oaken door bound in iron... and thrumming. Rhythmic thudding noises accompany small shifts in the door's position.  Someone (or something) is trying to breach the temple.\n\n&gt; After a short discussion, a quick plan forms everyone moves to their positions. Rickart gets some villagers to help him barricade two of the three archways, in order to funnel enemies through a bottleneck. Nez moves behind the altar, where he finds a priest, cowering. Nez pulls the priest to his feet and readies himself, shrugging off his disguise.  At the sight of the fearsome dragonborn, the priest panics and takes a swing at him with a golden mace, but Nez is not harmed.  The priest composes himself and awaits what is to come with fear in his eyes.  \n\n&gt; After confirming the door at the rear is still clear, Alice takes up a position at the front of the building, nocking an arrow. Couth starts ferrying villagers to safety out the rear exit, ready to protect them.  A small number of villagers stand by ready to hold off the enemy while their families and friends are made safe.\n\n&gt; Rickart then has a last-minute moment of inspiration. Rummaging in his bag, he pulls out a small bag, a bottle and a box.  He opens the bag and ours out ball bearings right in front of the main door. He then pours oil from the bottle to form a puddle at the entrance, with a trail leading back to one of the pillars forming the archways.  He then hunkers down behind the pillar, his tinderbox at the ready.  Aside from the thuds at the door, all is silent.\n\nThis was indeed a hail-mary from me - I scanned my inventory for anything that might help, and this is what I came up with. \n\n&gt; With a sudden, thunderous crash, and cries of \"FOR TIAMAT!\" the front door shatters to flinders.  Kobolds and cultists pour through the opening, but find their footing unsteady.  Several fall clumsily to the floor, covering themselves in the oil found there.  Rickard strikes a spark and flames engulf the invaders, sending several to an early doom.\n\n&gt; Alice lets her arrow fly, striking a cultist in the chest, and she moves in quickly to finish him with her sword.  Suddenly, overwhelming odds have been evened - hope springs into the hearts of the assembled throng.\n\nSo far, so good.  My plan worked better than I had hoped!\n\n&gt; Nez, seeing his opportunity, lets fly with his lightning breath.  A searing blue line of electric fire sears through the air.  it incinerates a kobold... and two nearby villagers.  Another villager is badly injured, dropping to the ground.  Realization dawns on Nez's face as he perceives what he has done, and he slumps bonelessly to the ground behind the altar, overcome with anguish.\n\nMy son had a proper crisis of conscience here.  He lined up his shot, and while he knew what was likely to happen, he decided his character didn't and would let fly with the breath anyway.  He felt those  innocent lives go, and folded it right into his character.  I couldn't have been more proud.\n\n&gt; While Nez cries out in anguish, Alice and Rickart continue the battle.  In the melee, Alice takes a knife to the guts, and the exhaustion of the combined events of the day proves to much for her. She collapses unconscious.\n\n&gt; Rickart retreats to join Nez behind the altar, and tries to talk him down. Couth, having finished getting the remaining villagers free runs in to aid his comrades.  He punches a kobold in the solar plexus and its lights go out immediately, and follows through with shuriken to a cultist.  \n\n&gt; After calming his friend, Rickart and Nez arise to rejoin the fight.  The priest, inspired by htier courage, also readies himself to join in. Nez strides purposefully to the remaining enemies, aglow in his mage armor and his staff pulsing with purple energy.  He swings a mighty blow down on the remaining cultist's head, caving in his skull and driving his now lifeless body to the floor.\n\n&gt; While his friends and the villagers see a fountain of gore erupt from the dead man, Nez sees fountains of light in all colors of the rainbow.  He stands bathed in radiance for a moment, and is at peace.  His vision fades quickly though, and he is all too aware of the blood on his hands. \n\nShillelagh is a GREAT combat spell.  We goofed a bit about the rainbows out of the guys head, but we all quickly agreed that in this form it was canon.  Nez is messed up in the head, after all.\n\n&gt; The priest draws up to the group after all the enemies are dispatched, and Rickart demands that he help his friend, who remains unconscious.  He extends a hand and suffuses Alice with divine energy, stabilizing her.  The group gathers themselves and quickly makes for the exit, and for safety.  They will tally the full costs of this battle later, when there is time - for now, they flee through the night.\n\nWe managed to get this session in before a forced hiatus, as we all wanted to see how this played out.  I think we have some amazing RP fodder for next time.  ",

        "text": "Sorry for not posting for a while.  Real life has been a little rough recently, trying to figure out things for this game, and I'd planned on getting this out last Thursday.\n\nSo, last time.  I'm at a party, acting as a bodyguard, and am confronted with a cute Japanese girl, who's also Tammamo no Mae.  Aka that one Kitsune that may or may not have poisoned an Emperor, and is supposed to be stuck, sealed in a rock.\n\nKeeping in mind that she's supposed to be an expert with illusions, as all Kitsune are, I'm somewhat wary, but my character is a trapper who's been effectively raised by a wolf and another trapper for a mother.  My character is pretty much a witty, genre-savvy trapper who's trying for a ranger style of play in a Scion setting, right now.\n\nEven as I keep one eye on the party, I offer her sake, she talks about wanting to make a trade for \"her mirror\", and my character generally treats it as Kane Taoka having stolen the mirror from her.  Not that I knew who he was yet.  At this point, Kane was, rather than the pain he'd eventually become, just a blown up idiot who's heart got eaten by my friend, guide and partner, Fenris.  So we talk.  She's more than willing to make a deal for the mirror, and I'm not QUITE savvy enough to realize that without it, I'm going to have a harder time doing damage.  (For those that don't know it, Guns in Scion don't get bonus damage from the amount of Epic Strength you have, unless you're using crossbows.  So unless you move up to a bazooka, or a cannon, you've got problems.  The damage scales downwards pretty fast once you're out of Scion: Hero.)\n\nSo.  For enchanting the bulletproof vest made from a certain Nemian Crocodile's hide for Fenris, she gets the mirror.  Resulting in a permanent enchantment that makes Fenris look like a normal average German Shepard, rather than the half ton wolf he is.  (And, because they were poorly made, these were only able to handle being 1 dot relics.  So there's that, too.  Of course, that didn't really get noticed until Scion: Demigod, but we'll get to that eventually...).  We agree to do the trade after the party is over.  Which I'm grateful for.  Things could have gone a LOT worse if we hadn't have had that mirror.\n\nI move to check things out more, only for something new to happen!  A giant bat shaped creature attacks the outside of the building.  As well as a bunch of fighting on the stairs.  Oh boy!  More combat!  Lucas joins me at the stairs, and we work to ensure that this giant Man-Bat (Oh, hello DC Cameo!) is dealt with after he moves to back up his henchmen, as well as his goons.  We run off the bat, but capture the goons for the Police.  (Never to be seen again!  Irritatingly enough.)\n\nLots of grumbling from them, but we do learn that the Precinct for such crazy nuts as we've been fighting is called \"Precinct 13\", and the officer we meet in question is someone named Jim Corrigan (Another DC cameo, though I didn't know it then).  And thus, after all is said and done, I finish the deal with Tammamo.  Since I still have the original stats, here's a copy of what the relic was like in this game.  (Keep in mind, Kieran ran the game so you could do 12 ticks of speed a round, not 6, to speed things up.)\n\n5* relic Yata no Kagami\nAllows you to channel the sun perview\nLets you use it to look through mirrors, for legend x 5 miles, and allow you to use your boons and attributes through the mirrored surface\nAllows you to use it as a discus\n+2 lethal damage + epic strength number\n30 yards range (doubled with epic strength)\n6 speed (twice, if you can catch it on the rebound)\nPiercing weapon\n\nThe enchantment of the illusion works well, allowing us to have Fenris as a viable combat party member even in normal fights.  Unfortunately, though... all good things must come to and end.\n\nThe next day, we're called in by Falcone once more.  He has a job for us, in return for the work we gained for the new coats, and Fenris' bullet proof vest.  Something's in the sewers.  Something that's eating people, animals, everything it can find, that supposedly looks like a crocodile.  On the plus side?  We get that little girl's full information who we've been sheltering.  She's an Oracle, but needs special regents to have her abilities work.  Thus why that other group wanted her so bad.  But now that she's under our Aegis, she won't be bothered anymore.  Which means we can have the entire party travel together now!\n\nKeep in mind, at this point, we're legend 3 right now.  Not legend 4, or 5.  So we've got a maximum epic level for anything of 2, and that means we only get a maximum bonus of 2 to anything we do.  We're still mostly running on our normal stats, not so much our epic ones.  And this is one of the fights I most look back at and hate.\n\nThe smell hits us first.  A rotting stench, like all sewers, that we can't really breathe through our noses from.  And for Fenris, it's even worse.  But we push on.  I'm eager for crocodile skin boots.  And expecting something like that character \"Killer Croc\" or whatever from Marvel.\n\nInstead, we get a shapeshifting monster.  I can't remember if it was a troll, or a giant, but this went poorly.  And oh boy, does this fight hurt.  We're only legend 3, so we have a massive handicap in this fight.  And it shows.  At first, we do well.  Fenris is dishing out aggravated damage, and we're hoping we can kill it quick, before it can really hurt us.  Then the troll decides to go for Fenris first.  17 damage in the first attack, and close to that for the second.\n\nFenris is dead.  They weaken the monster, and I take the finishing shot to kill it, Lucas skipping his turn for me to do so.  With Fenris' death, so died my character's naive hopes that things would work out well.  That the Norse pantheon is a good one.  With this, Erik starts remembering the more unpleasant things Fenris warned him about the pantheon, and wonders if this is when the pantheon will show up, like Fenris warned him.  If his pantheon would ignore him until Fenris was dead or not.\n\nAnd my character turns to alcohol over things, barely caring about anything else.  In every scene for until Svartelfheim's second go through, my character can be seen drinking from his flask from this event.  More than that, he goes somewhat paranoid and wary of his pantheon, too.\n\nI'll continue this later.  Sorry for it being so late!",

        "text": "It was a decidedly inauspicious beginning to the campaign. We had successfully performed session 0 of the campaign, during which the party all independently gathered to collect the bounty on a local ogre. One of them was a skeletal gunslinger who was convinced he was a cowboy, and another was a sylph so incredibly air-headed that it was a marvel she remembered to stand. Both of them had pulled their weight in combat, but had reasons not to participate in more than the introduction (that being scheduling conflicts and taking immense offense at being expected to *stop playing MOBAs in order to attend the session*. The horror, the indignity), so there were only two characters for our marvelous beginning.\n\nI played Sixfinger. Goblin alchemist and outcast among his own kind for- among other things- polydactly (hence the name) and stealing everything of value from his hometown and running off. Despite his small statue, he specialized in wielding two-handed weapons, increasing his size, and taking on animalistic aspects to augment his defenses and mobility. He was a frontline combatant. The other party member was... Raghnall. Raghnall is some sort of necromancer, not a wizard but very definitely capable of summoning hordes of undead. He also completely abandoned his physical abilities in favor of being able to mess with people's heads and spread his cult of evil, undeath, necromancy, and general human suffering.\n\nAnd let me clarify: He really was built for it. Despite all the events that happened afterward.\n\nSixfinger, whose motives went as far as 'pay me to do stuff', was returning to a tiny little hamlet nearby, intent on collecting the bounty on the ogre. Raghnall also came for the coin, but he had... other plans. His permanent skeletal minion gathered up the ogre's body, and brought it to a nearby patch of woodland where it wouldn't be disturbed. Then, as Raghnall and Sixfinger collected their coin, Raghnall managed to gather information on some sort of local vagrant (interesting), con the mayor out of paying us double by stating that he would be carrying the fee to the absentee party members (complete horseshit), and suggested that there might be something sinister on the horizon (alas, all too true). Sixfinger could have given less of a shit, but approved of being paid twice over for one job.\n\nThen, Raghnell took Sixfinger aside and talked about his Master Plan.\n\nBasically, he would raise the ogre as an undead minion, find the vagrant's dwelling in the forest, and frame the vagrant for raising the aforementioned ogre. Then, we would swoop in, defeat the undead monstrosity, get paid AGAIN, and possibly even be hired to hunt down the vagrant. All while being heroes, and beloved by the people blah blah blah. Raghnall would then use this to further his evil cultist goals, but Sixfinger could give less of a shit about that. He heard 'more money', and that was basically all there was to it. He was in.\n\nFirst things first, the ogre had to be raised. They grabbed the corpse and discovered- to their dismay- that it was too large to be a proper minion. But Sixfinger was rather pragmatic about it all, and suggested carving it into smaller pieces. After all, undead screaming heads could be made, so why not limbs of an ogre? Raghnell had his skeletal steward carve the body up into two pieces, and raised both, using a bit of creative spellwork. Thus was born the fearsome terror of the woods- Leggy Lou and Torso Boy. After that, the party set off to track the vagrant, scouting the nearby wood for trails, but the vagrant proved rather difficult to track. Sixfinger decided to split off and get more information from the town, while Raghnell redoubled his efforts to track the vagrant, taking 20 to find even a scrap of a trail.\n\nSixfinger was treated as a hero, given gifts and nice foods, told all that the villagers knew, and was enjoying himself.\n\nRaghnell was discovering the hard way that the vagrant was, in fact, a similar-level ranger, on favored terrain, who specialized in stealth and archery. Oh, and he was NOT a fan of the Blatantly Evil Necromancer walking around with undead minions in the Sinister Robes Of Doom^^TM. So Raghnell was quickly becoming a pincushion, and only saved himself by hiding behind his trusty companions, the aforementioned Leggy Lou and Torso Boy, and his very own skeletal steward. Between the three of them, they fended the ranger off, but did not manage to capture him. So, Raghnell made the only rational choice- he instructed the two half-ogres to march villageward and kill any living creature they came across.\n\nYeah. Did I mention that the village had a population of 50, and no defenses to speak of?\n\nSixfinger's enjoyment of his heroic moment was spoiled when the town mayor held an emergency meeting, stating that there was a sinister necromancer in the woods, and that the local ranger had barely escaped with his life. The town quickly decided to abandon their homes and flee. Sixfinger, sensing opportunity, offered to take up a contract to kill the undead menace. The mayor explained that they just didn't have the money. Even when Sixfinger offered alternate forms of payment, like old spellbooks and alchemical reagents. They just didn't have ANYTHING- they'd spent it all on killing the ogre. Who was now two significantly stronger undead minions, by the way! So, lacking anything else, Sixfinger agreed that fleeing was the smart option. Then, he perched atop a nearby house and ate popcorn while the town collectively shat itself in the panic to get away.\n\nAs it turned out, they were not fast enough. The undead minions crashed the party, slaughtering people left and right. Children were trampled in the panic, the only 'town guard' was almost immediately killed, and three quarters of the population didn't even escape. It was a bloodbath. Sixfinger just thought it was a shame nobody had the cash to pay him, and continued enjoying the show. Though it was somewhat undercut by watching the people who had given him free food being messily slaughtered. For one thing, it got blood in his popcorn.\n\nMeanwhile, Raghnell was continuing to fuck things up. He found the ranger's hut, hidden in the woods, and decided that the only thing to do was set it on fire. In the woods. During the summer. Them his brilliant plan complete, he returned to the town to survey his triumph, finding a smoking ruin filled with blood and death. Truly, his holy work had been done. He tracked down Sixfinger and made an impassioned speech about how they could continue on like this, taking people for everything they were worth, and even serving a higher cause!\n\nSixfinger had two rebuttals. One, 'all they were worth' was gotten pretty easily when we did the damn bounty. And all the loot from the town consisted of 40 gold and a couple of longbows. Plus, they would NEVER HIRE US AGAIN. And second, Sixfinger was INCREDIBLY skeptical of 'higher causes'- especially when Raghnell stated that this would please *someone or other* and that their favor would be worth more than gold. Which was point three- Sixfinger was pretty sure the only thing more valuable than gold was *more gold*. So he promptly called the necromancer an idiot, and stated that this sort of destruction was stupidly wasteful. Raghnell insisted that it was all for the best, and furthermore, he'd be staying around to make some more undead and shrines to his dead god. In an empty, burning village. Surrounded by dry grasses. Which were already on fire.\n\nSIXFINGER: \"Yeah, BYE.\"\n\nThis was not the end of the evil fuckery, though. Raghnell proceeded to decorate the town as a charnel house, gather up all the bodies, and attempt to create horrible undead abominations out of the remains. At which he failed. *Three times, in a row*. The bodies being utterly ruined and useless for necromancy, and his patron god none too impressed, he decided to pull a hail mary and create a DIFFERENT sort of undead out of the spirits of all those who died in pain and agony, furious at the living, and spreading even more death and suffering. Despite the fact that *he himself* would undoubtably be the target of that fury. Even his patron god didn't think it was a good idea, but Raghnell was determined to impress his necroboss, so he began a ritual *far* outside of his current capabilities, and in a complete twist of events, fucked it up royally.\n\nThat isn't to say he failed at creating a vengeful ghost. No! he successfully summoned it... directly into his own head. Where it proceeded to set up camp and refuse to leave, determined to bring this douchebag to justice. Raghnell had inadventantly given himself a hostile split personality, gotten himself fuck all in terms of loot, was now a wanted man, and was camped out in a village that was now *very much* on several kinds of fire. Oh, and his evil god was supremely unimpressed with his stupid ass.\n\nThis was not helped at all by Sixfinger cheerfully telling the ranger, who had fled the carnage and was seeking some authority to call and stop the murderous madman, all about Raghnell's necromancy powers, ideology, patron god, and where he was likely to go next. He received a nice tip for the information, and was even hired to pass the word along to someone who could take more proactive measures.\n\nI cannot wait to find out where this stupidity goes next.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8tcrl7/pathfinder_the_sword_with_the_most_player_kills/",
        "text": "intelligent items are always a special kind of fun, but Augen auge was probably the one intelligent item I partly regret creating, if only because it was just powerful enough to warrant the players not giving it up until it really became a problem.\n\nAugen auge was a fucking nasty piece of work that the players had pulled out of the depths of hell from one of the many prison cells within the city of Dis. It contained the soul of an ex- Marquess of hell, who had been sealed inside the sword as punishment, because he was being too 'chaotic' for asmodeus's tastes and decided to seal him in there as a sort of ironic punishment. I did put it there as a bit of side content with greater risk, and they really worked hard to get through all the defenses to get at it, steal it, and bolt out of there once their business was done.\n\nThe first wielder of the sword was the parties assassin, Augen auge shifts to match it's masters favoured weapon provided that weapon is bladed, so it took the form of a rapier with a large glowing red eye on the pommel, like a mini tower of sauron. The weapon was basically just a nice +3 sword until it drew blood, then it would turn into a sword with reach, and it drained one point of a stat from it's target per hit, the stat was always the same stat as it's wielders highest stat. So for the assassin, it was dexterity. But it gets better, for every stat point it drains, the sword also inflicts negative energy damage, 1d4 additional damage, per stat point drained. The major downside was that if it didn't 'drink blood' by the end of the players turn, it would hit the player for one regular attack and cause maximum negative energy damage. The sword could be deactivated if left in the sheath for ten minutes, or be 'placated' for a round or two by covering it with a decent amount of blood. If removed from the sheath while it's deactivating, you get hit with five attacks with max negative energy damage.\n\nAnyway, the assassin got a lot of use out of it, for a good few sessions she was really able to clean the floor with enemies using this thing, even getting creative with it at some points by using the negative energy damage the sword caused to rot wooden parts of buildings or use the reach on it to hit people through arrow slits. But it was during a boss fight against a tiefling that could fly, that our dear assassin met her end. She had gotten a few strikes off on him before being relegated to minion cleaning duty, these did eventually run out though, and Augen auge started feeding off of her, sucking her dry by the time the fight was over. They couldn't even resurrect her after they fled the crumbling mines because the sword had eaten her soul, but none of them knew that. They just assumed she was damned for using it, so they gave the blade to the fighter, and set off to save her damned soul.\n\nThe fighter got even more use out of it since it was a bastard sword, now with added reach. He was able to bring down a lot of monsters he would have normally been a match for in melee with ease because of it, the sword rarely dealt backlash damage to him because he was always in the thick of it. One fight saw them right at the 'entry house of hell', basically one of the places were souls arrive and devils sort them out, it was a legion of lamurs, which are basically balls of puss filled flesh, very weak. He was killing them right, left and center, each one he killed only making it easier to kill the next, to a point where he was standing atop a corpse pile of the things. The rest of the party were searching through magical records, with the use of a 'speed reading' spell the wizard had and had made scrolls for, so the others could do the same. It took one round to bring him from max health to nothing. He had performed over 100 attacks, and got hit with 400+ negative energy damage.\n\nThird wielder was actually the parties sorcerer, he made it the longest out of all of them simply because the sword could not mentally dominate him, and he rarely used it. In the end it did get him at an unexpected moment. He was finally out of spells, which was damn rare for him, but they were in an absolute slog of a dungeon crawl and they refused to take any long rests since they were on a bit of a time limit (They had a month to do something, they cleared this dungeon in a single day, which was supposed to take them about a week by how I had scheduled everything). He had used the sword in one fight near the end when some beasties glomped him, saved his life since the monster attacking him was ugly as sin, so had low charisma, and thus died in just a few hits from stat drain damage. He sheathed it again without issue and they pushed on to the final room. Just before entering, he pulled the sword...and died instantly, since he had last drawn the sword two minutes ago, I did time it with an hourglass. He took 5 stab wounds and dropped dead, withered to dust like the fighter and assassin before him.\n\nForth one was a barbarian, the new character of the fighter. Out of all of them, he actually got the least use out of it since his main stat was constitution, so he could only really use his new soul drinking axe to soften up people for the new rogue's poisons, which did horrifying stuff like cause death effects of massive stat drains. He took the brunt of Augen auge thirst with gusto, it hit him more than anyone else, but did the least to him due to his insane hitpoint pool. But it did eventually claim his life when he was grappled by a devilish tentacle swarm which held him in place, slashed him, and choked him all while his own weapon attacked him.\n\nThe fifth and final death was the beloved party war priest. This was a sweet mousy kind of girl, but was the secondary fighter in the group, she kept the spellcasters safe, and often spent more time fighting with an automatic, enchanted crossbow. They were fighting off a swarm of fallen angels and demonic harpies on their way to a big summoning ritual, having to climb up a massive black rock tower. Instead of going on the inside, they used spiderclimb spells, flight spells and a broom to go on the outside, hence the flying enemies. Her favourite crossbow was knocked out of her hands and hung on a rope ten feet down, so she reverted to melee and tried to fend the harpies off, killing a good number of them before they recognized what the sword was, and backed off. Without anything to hit, no matter how hard she tried, the sword slowly but surely killed her, the corpse of everyones favorite party member plummeting to the rocks below.\n\nAfter that, they took the sword to an angel and let him keep it. They got a new magical item in return, but from then on they made sure to always read the item card i gave them EXTREMELY carefully and do the math before so much as touching it. They could have thrown Augen auge away at any point, but they just really liked having that double edged sword, even if it cut them more often than not.",

        "text": "This was one of the rare few times I got to be a player, but instead of a start up campaign, I was taking the place of someone else who dropped out due to unexplained reasons, I assumed it was just personal reasons and went ahead with character creation, learned what I needed to about the setting, lore, etc. Showed up to the first session with the DM, met the group, and not long after the session began, I learned why the other guy had dropped out...probably.\n\nThe group consisted of a wizard, a barbarian and a gunslinger, the guy who had dropped out used to be the parties cleric. I came in with a bard, mainly because the rest of the group had basically no real 'talkers' and bard is my go to class after sourcerer. Apparently, this was a grave insult to the wizard, who believed that he should be the only one who should cast arcane spells, and saw all other casters as inferior to himself in every regard. After some mild 'debates' he shut up and we carried on.  \n\n\nFor the purposes of this story, the setting, and overall campaign, do not matter. It was High Fantasy though, and there were lots of wizards and magical guilds and stuff, my guy was one of the rare freelance mages, he had dropped out after finding the path to sorcery to self-restrictive and decided to just live his life in freedom (as free as a spellcaster could be in that world at any rate). I was introduced to the group during a festival, where i talked several 'magi hunters' out of attacking the group, and convinced them that they should just let us move along. We palled up and eventually decided to boodle about, learn about each other and have a nice time until the rest of the group had to continue on, and as my character had nothing better to do, the gunslinger offered me a pay percentage and like that I was on board.\n\n What followed was a slow but certain descent on the spiral of hatred between myself and the wizard. It started off small, little jabs here and there, first about my character effectively being a college drop-out, but then it just got worse as time went on, like focusing on my characters race (He was a half elf), then he just got abusive, like actively cutting me out of loot. After about five sessions of this shit, I decided this was going to be enough and waited for the right moment. \n\nThe wizard was going to be granted a rank within the academy he was a part of, after having brought this artifact we had all worked for to them...and he took all the credit. It was mid ceremony that I challenged him to a magical duel. While I never passed mage college, I was still official, and could challenge anyone at or above my rank. Taking the bait, he accepted, and the terms were set. The duel would take place tomorrow, inside of a 30ft radius circle, made out of baked clay and wood in the middle of the courtyard before the presiding council. To add to the stakes, if I won, he'd have to quit being a mage and become the new librarian, if he won, I'd become his slave for a few years and be stripped of my right to use magic. The loser was decided by getting knocked unconscious, or death. Those who died in the ring were not allowed to be revived unless the victor allowed it.\n\nNow, I don't know what he did for preparation, but the DM was kind enough to let me have access to some divine spells as well as arcane ever since I first started playing. To add to this careful planning of spells, I was able to convince the other players to lend me a few magical items, and was a bit cheeky because I also stole some scrolls from the library.\n\nEveryone gathered for the fight, students, teachers, the council, etc, everyone was going to take this first hour of the day off to see a genuine spellslinging event. The wizard was decked out in his usual gear in addition to his new staff of office, a nasty artifact to be sure. I showed up in a thick cloak, hood pulled over my face, hiding what i had on underneath until the announcement was made to begin. It all came down to that first dice roll in the end, the initiative, the wizards stats were good...But I was wearing the gunslingers cloak of dexterity boosting (can't remember the fancy name), so I just scraped by. I could have cast anything, but I knew damn well which spell I wanted to use first.  \n\n\nSuddenly, the ground underneath the wizard burst into a writhing pile of long, black, hissing creatures, all of them angry, and all of them went for the wizards ankles. Sticks to snakes, bitch! With the added bonus of the square he was on being turned into difficult terrain because the sticks had been supporting the clay, which crumbled to chunks and dust. Five small vipers aren't much of a threat, but they were still able to nibble off 10 of his hitpoints. Now, he tried to take his turn and cast silence on me, so I couldn't cast anything else. It seems that he forgot that counter-spell was a thing, probably because the DM never used it. He also took about 10 more points from the attacks of opportunity from the snakes, then about the same when he moved out of the square away from the snakes, who did follow him and attacked him once again. He had lost 50 HP due to these things. His AC was like...13 or so,the 3 coming from his dexterity, it wasn't hard to hit this guy.\n\nNext turn of mine? Summon monster level 6. I had to roll to use the scroll I stole, but damn was it worth it to see him get mauled to death by a fucking dire bear. It grappled him and kept him from casting spells as it ate his face off and got bit to death by the snakes. I was declared the winner upon his death, since no one could pull them off of him in time. This asshole begged me to let his character come back to life, but considering all he had put me through, and that he had made the other guy quit for the same behaviour, I decided against it.\n\nThe weirdest bit was after the session, when that guy had left bitching about how bullshit that fight had been and how I was a cheating asshole. The DM pulled me aside and told me I couldn't come to the next session because the other guy would never shut up and would only make things worse for us all. I asked him \"why don't you just invite eric back and kick him out? 4 member party, minus Lucas.\" There was a genuine pause where he was obviously weighing up the options, said he'd think on it, and two days later he dropped the wizard and eric came back, had a grand old time of it afterwards.

        "text": "I think this is going to sound a bit silly... But it's something I thought about today and really wanted to share somewhere...\n\nDo you remember the dreams you had when you were 5 years old? A point in your life where you really had no concept of what the world really was, and your brain would fill in the blanks with it's own wild imagination? I'm talking about the dreams that didn't always make sense, but felt like a memory from a past life, or otherwise provoked strong emotions in you. I'll come back to this in a minute.\n\nThe first time I played Oblivion was seriously magical. Coming from Morrowind, so many of the little touches that Bethesda put in were immediately apparent. Hitting a bucket hanging from a rope with an arrow actually caused it to move. The bodies of enemies actually ragdolled instead of crumpled in a stiff death animation. The spells nolonger took up your weapon slot, and you could heal yourself without putting away your sword. Every little object in the game could be knocked about with hyper realistic physics. All of this was discovered in the first ten minutes of the game. And when we finally broke out of the sewers and looked across the lake into the lush green world, it was just majestic. Never before, and never again did I just stop and find myself entirely breathless at the realism and beauty of the world in a game.\n\nThe first thing I did was try to make my own spells, but was banned from doing so until I had access to the Arcane University, which would require a recommendation from every Mages Guild Hall in Cyrodil except for the Kvatch Mages Guild (Press F). I decided to start from the West, and work my way East. The first Mages Guild Hall I saw was the [Anvil Mages Guild](http://images.uesp.net//d/d5/OB-interior-Anvil_Mages_Guild_Living_Quarters.jpg). I froze up when I looked inside.\n\nFeelings of implacable nostalgia washed over me as though I'd been here before. The dusty books, the beautiful stone walls and ceilings, crystal balls, alchemy equipment, and magical paraphernalia evoked memories of dreams I had as a kid, exploring attics and basements of magical houses. The Mages Guild Hall looked *just* like them. So much so that if I didn't know better, I'd say that my 5 year old self was the art director for the game. I sobbed for a good 5 minutes trying to piece together in my head fragments of these emotional, foggy, sleepy, innocent dreams that I'd long forgotten.\n\n[Lego Island may have destroyed my childhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6sj6r1/lego_island_how_this_game_stole_my_innocence_and/), but Oblivion made memories of it come flooding back.",

        "text": "One of the rare few times I got to be a player was during a very heavily modified version of the Giant slayers pathfinder adventure path. I already knew it off by heart, but the GM (we'll call him David) changed it so much that only a few faces and story beats were the same. \n\nThe campaign started off pretty easily, a murder mystery, a plot to siege the town from the inside using tunnels and a boss fight against a troll and it's orcish minions, same as the adventure path, we also question the survivors to figure out what's going on and why they raided, turns out giants sent them, hill giants, but then we get this tid bit \"the mountain, it comes, it comes for all the land, none shall resist being ground to meal beneath his heel.\" For now we had to continue on, cos the message for help, and the actual arrival of said help, would take too long to arrive before the giant warband arrived, so we were geared up, given some legend about giant slaying stuff (which we never found because our ranger is an idiot and dropped the map overboard into the river) and tried to do our best to get to the giants and head them off.  \n\n\nI'm going to skip a lot of details now, because while i really would love to detail everything this guy did for the campaign (he fixed every issue of the adventure path and then some), it's better for me to focus on specific elements. First was the actual fighting of giants, david actually approached me to help him make giants less of a fumbling sack of hitpoints, since he trusted me to help a fellow DM out. We brain stormed it for a while, and eventually he went off on his own so i wasn't spoiled. These things were turned from sacks of hitpoints into real ordeals, every fight against them was memorable, even if it was just a single giant. But what most striking were the 'bosses'. each and every one answered to one figure, one voice, one entity, the mountain. We had a hill giant redhead who wished to prove herself worthy of his might and intended to use the PC's and their gear as sacrifices to try and advance in rank. The death knight ice queen had been frozen stiff for centuries before she was finally awoken by the bellowing skyquakes that had started up some months ago, and she was one of the few who understood them. The king and queen of a fire giant tribe had sworn themselves to this figure. all of them kept mentioning the same thing, the mountain. Even the final boss of the original pathfinder adventure path, a stormgiant, had been made to bow before this unseen figure.   \n\n\nHe was never seen, but from day one we felt his presence. The entire region had been experiencing earthquakes recently, in an oddly steady thumbing, like a heartbeat, or footsteps. Skyquakes were common to, as this deep bellow ripped through the sky and caused utter havoc with the local wildlife populations, even the clouds began to collect at certain points across the region, obscuring everything nearby. There was something big coming, and we were nipping at it's toes. Bit by bit we slowly killed, bargained, lied and stole our way through the adventure, even having to cause cave ins to mass murder some fire giants just to continue on, with their slaves buried with them. By the end of the campaign, we were well honed killing machines for killing giants, the ranger even had some attack on titan spiderman pants.\n\nIt all came to a head with the final dungeon, a mountain top castle in one of the spiraling cloud storms, we killed our way through it before just barely murdering the final boss of the adventure path, the stormlord. with his death, the clouds faded away, the sky was clear, and then, we saw the mountain. Originally i had thought it was going to be some other monster monolithic monster from a different adventure path, the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, a giant otherworldly mammoth from another dimension, but it was so much better. When the clouds cleared, the battlefield swept of dust, we could not see the sun, for something stood in its way. A seven hundred foot tall humanoid figure, arms thick as buildings, eyes burning like the sun it now blotted, a sea of waving hair. Its movements were ponderous, it's words slow, but we understood them. It told us we would have one day to rest and prepare, we had earned the attention of the mountain, and we would be the first to be crushed by him. He turned and faded into nothingness  \n\n\nThroughout this long campaign, David had been working out, he had been a bit pudgy beforehand and was apparently doing this to get in shape, he looked pretty good by that second to last session, not \"the rock\" good, but better than most of us. On that final session, he arrived in a robe i had lent him, an old prop of mine from a campaign some time ago, he refused to let any of us see his face and told us to get ready for the session. We sat around the table, got ready, listened to the exposition that lead us to the final fight and prepared for the mountains arrival.  \n\n\nHe didn't so much appear from thin air as grow out of the horizon, slowly approaching the mountain top we had killed his general upon, every footstep an earthquake, every deep breath a mini skyquake, the winds shifting as he disturbed the air, creating tornados in his wake. He did not explain who he was, he only asked us a single question, the only one that mattered.\" are you ready?\" our actions spoke louder than words...As did Davids. He took his arm, and shoved all his notes, the DM screen and other nicknacks of his off the table, stood up, and threw off the robe. Turns out his girlfriend had a friend who worked in movie make up, and he had hired her to paint him from the waist up so he could be actual final boss for this campaign.  \n\n\nHe had the mountains character sheet in front of him, a large collection of metal dice, and a granite stone bowl to use as a dice cup. David had become the Goliath. It took three hours, every magical item we had and just about every weapon in our toolbox, but we killed him, but only after the fight did i realize something. The party wizard had been packing a spell called shrink person, and he had wish prepared...he hadn't used his wish spells all throughout that fight, when I asked him as I drove us home, he simply looked at me and said \"Would you have wanted to rob him of all that hard work, just shrinking him down to a normal giants size?\" My response was simple \"you could have prepared meteor.\" And my pal foreshadowed the actions of one of his future monk characters \"he would have caught the meteor and thrown it back at us.\"",

The idea was for this bard to be a quiet character that communicates through music... that was until he rolled his stats. \n\nThis bard ended up with an intelligence of 6, and the party decided that he would be a mute bard, not because he couldn't talk, but he could never learn how. \n\nHe was kicked out of the Bard's College and his family sent him north to live with his cousin so they wouldn't have to deal with them. \n\nMy party is then trying to find out a way to communicate with the bard when they realize that, being a noble background, the bard can have proficiency in one board game. \n\nThey then ask me \"is scrabble canon\" \n\nSo communication with this nearly retarded, mute, bard worked by this bard using scrabble tiles to spell out words, and later using thunder magic to move them into a sentence above his head. \n\nHe later went on get two sex changes, both into women, and marry the duke.

        "text": "**Tl;Dr- Players are surpringly insightful during the most epic D&amp;D session I have ever had the pleasure of DMing. I am reduced to tears by them.**\n\nThis is a retelling of the night I peaked as a DM. It happened a little over a year ago.\n\n\nThe party consisted of a \"Tiefling\" Bard, a Human Necromancer, a Svirfneblin Illusion Wizard, and a Half-elf \"multiclasser\".\n\n(I put Tiefling in quotes because he's actually the half Dragonborn/half Succubus son of his previous character. We used Tiefling stats.)\n\nImportant to this story is that the party was questing after the weapons of the gods, which would allow them to challenge the evil God-Emperor, Rex Sr. They had already obtained The Bow of the Feywild, and the Hammer of Elements.\n\nThe \"Tiefling\" Bard, Rex Jr, was built around the idea of the Bard prestige class in AD&amp;D. You had to take so many levels of fighter and rogue, then befriend the druids, and finally get in contact with a master bard to teach you the old ways...\n\nWell, through the course of their adventures, he did everything except the last one.\n\nSo, I made a prop letter and sent him an invite to visit \"The Bard Prince Orpheus\" at his estate in The South Seas.\n\nThe players call in some favors, get a boat and sail out to the island.\n\nThey stay at a very nice seaside inn, and meet the excitable inkeeper, Melody Seasong (An apparent Drow with blue eyes and no sunlight aversion). They chat with her a while, and try to pump her for information about The Bard Prince. Unfortunately, although she heard many fanciful childhood stories about The Prince, she has never met the man. He is either very secretive, or a myth. The only info she can really offer is a brief description that her mother told her; he is a red-haired [Eladrin](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/a/a2/Eladrin_-_Anne_Stokes.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090529234741) with very tanned skin, blue-green eyes and a voice like a God.\n\nImportant to note here is that in my setting, Eladrin are the older, ancient race of elves. They are excessively rare, and basically only occur in The Feywild.\n\nThe next morning, Prince Orpheus \"pulls a Yoda\" on the players as they are exploring the island (I wasn't very subtle here). After his identity is \"discovered\", he declares that Rex Jr will be put through four trials; the trial of the warrior, the trial of the thief, the trial of the druid, and the trial of the bard.\n\nThe trial of the warrior commences immediately; a friendly duel. Rex Jr, who wields the Bow of the Feywild, turns Orpheus in to an Elven pincushion. He sorely, but cheerfully, bleeds his way back to his estate with the players in tow.\n\nPrince Orpheus' servants patch him up, and help him to a bath in the hot sping. Meanwhile, the players are given free run of the manor.\n\nThey meet a third \"servant\", an (apparently) aged elf who calls herself \"Nanna\". They have never encountered a wrinkled, grey-haired elf and are very stunned to have done so. Nanna cheerfully bakes cookies for the group, but eventually shoos them out of the kitchen, because her master is waiting for them.\n\nJeeves, the butler, directs the players into the hot spring, where The Prince is drinking wine, and apparently breathing a lot better without an arrow lodged in his chest.\n\nThere is a flirtatious comment concerning Rex Jr's apparent ability to penetrate things, which Rex's player reciprocates with a grin.\n\n(The player has decided that, as a son of The Succubus Queen, he doesn't necessarily discriminate between genders or sexes. Meanwhile, I am playing Orpheus off as a mix of Bowie and Mercury).\n\nPrince Orpheus states that \"The trial of the Thief is you must steal that which is most precious to me, and present it at my birthday party in 3 days time. Without. My. Notice.\"\n\nTo be honest, I didn't have a single one solution to this, though I threw in some red herrings such as a golden fiddle, Nanna's secret cookie recipe, and an old teddy bear... I largely wanted to see what the players made of the situation.\n\nI did not expect that my players would spend 3 (real-life) hours talking to Orpheus (and his servants), really getting to know him and forcing me to truly flesh him out.\n\nThey discover that despite looking like an Eladrin in the prime of his youth, Orpheus is old, possibly the oldest being they have encountered, except for Oberon and Tatiana (King and Queen of The Feywild).\n\nIn fact, Orpheus was blessed with eternal youth because Tatiana couldn't bear the thought of age marring his perfect face... However, Orpheus was later banished to The Mortal Realms for spurning her affections.\n\nHe is clearly nostalgic for the glory days of his youth, when he traveled the worlds with his friends. He says that he hasn't seen most of them in a very long time, as they all \"moved on without me\".\n\nThe players took this to mean that because Prince Orpheus is cursed with eternal youth, he saw all of his friends die of old age. They also notice an apparent obsession with astronomy and The North Star. \n\nWhen pressed, Orpheus gives an evasive answer,  \"The North Star is my oldest and greatest friend. I knew him in the halcyon summers of our childhood... Though, now, he walks where I cannot go.\"\n\nThe party shrugged this off, and they made their plan. While the Tiefling Bard keeps Orpheus busy with music, drink and \"companionship\", the others will search the mansion high and low.\n\nThey eventually find an extremely dusty, but heavily-trapped storage room. There is \"an old lyre leaning against the wall\". The half-elf multiclasser correctly IDs this as Orpheus' old arcane focus. (I originally intended for this to be another red herring, but read on!)\n\nUpon searching Orpheus' bedchambers, and large walk-in closet, they find a set of +2 leather armor of \"exquisite Ancient Elven design\" and a matching set of Boots of Elvenkind. \n\nThey take the armor and boots, and use illusion spells on one of Orpheus' suits to make it look as though the armor and boots are still in the closet.\n\nThey stash the armor away, and the search continues. The half-elf multiclasser finds the false back of the closet, and opens up a small room that is covered in even more dust than the storage room.\n\nSo as to not disturb the dust in the room, one of the wizards cast levitate on the half-elf. He floats into the room, and sees an extremely old painting on the wall.\n\n\"Gathered together are six adventurers. A silver Dragonborn paladin, with a dragon's head device upon his shield. A muscular Tiefling warrior, with a twisted black and red sword. A wiry Eladrin ranger with a glowing, green bow. A stout Dwarf barbarian in ragged cloths, wielding a familiar hammer. A fair-haired Human priest, with a shining spear and the device of the sun upon his robes. Orpheus, in his green armor with a wooden lyre.\"\n\nThe necromancer realizes who/what I just described, but he keeps that to himself for the moment. He searches Orpheus' desk, and finds the guest list for the party.\n\nAsmodeus, Moradin and Pelor are all on the list. Corellon Larethian and Bahamut are on a separate list, where Orpheus was apparently debating on inviting them (There is currently a war between the Dragonborn Empire and The Elven Confederation).\n\nThey cast \"Gentle Repose\" on the painting, roll it up and put it in a scroll tube.\n\n\nThen, a realization hit my players like a truck. Corellon, Et. Al are Orpheus' old adventuring friends... And it suddenly becomes the party's mission to get them all to attend.\n\nAt that point, I was ready to call it a night. It was 10:30pm. We usually quit by 10:00; 4/5 of us had work in the morning.\n\nThey begged me to keep going. So, I put on a fresh pot of coffee, and continued.\n\nThey forge invitations for both Bahamut and Corellon Larethian. The half-elf sends off a quick prayer to The Father of Elves, in the hope that it will sway him. The 'Tiefling' (who is half Dragonborn, and of Bahamut's holy lineage) does the same for his God.\n\nAs an afterthought, they also send an invite to the innkeeper, Melody Seasong. \n\nWe flash forward 3 days to the party. The half-elf multiclasser has actually spent most of his downtime this campaign improving his skills as a chef; he helps cook. Rex Jr writes music and \"spends *alone time* with Orpheus\".\n\nThe others continue exploring the mansion and reading his massive library of lore. They find an ancient poem that explains that Corellon Larethian is the one who set The North Star in the sky, to guide lost rangers.\n\nBefore the party, they dress Rex Jr up in Orpheus' armor, and he dances around, playing his new songs on Orpheus' lyre. The Bard Prince is quite amused.\n\nWe have fun role-playing this party, with many gods present.\n\nOrpheus, though happy about the turnout, is a little sad because he didn't ever send an invite to Corellon or Bahamut. He would have liked to see the old party back together.\n\nLater, the guests begin giving Orpheus his birthday presents. The players decide that they will go last.\n\nAs they approach his table, The North Star himself appears in a bright flash of sliver light. He is accompanied by an imposingly large, grey Dragonborn in plate armor.\n\nCorellon and Bahamut each greet their old friend warmly (although they are chilly towards each other).\n\nFor the first time since the players got here, the cloud of nostalgia and regret seems to lift from Orpheus' face. He is genuinely happy.\n\nFinally, the party approaches with the scroll tube.\n\nRex Jr, \"My... *Dear* Prince, I cannot truthfully say that I devised this plan. For as you know, my time was spent with you these last three days. My friends were the ones who made this possible.\"\n\nOrpheus likes this, \"One cannot stand alone in this world, that is certain.\"\n\nThey hand him the scroll, and as he unrolls it, the half-elf multiclasser drops a bomb that reduces me to tears, \"You know, parties may break up, but memories are eternal.\"\n\n\nIt was midnight. I was on my 4th cup of coffee. I don't play this game to feel... Needless to say, Rex Jr passed the trial.\n\n\nOrpheus addressed Rex, \"Thou has stolen that which I had thought under lock and key. Under watchful guard, thou has stolen away my heart, and now thou shall bear my blessing as a bard of the old ways.\"",

        "text": "This comes from a campaign I mentioned in a prior post, but for a quick refresher on it, the idea was that four groups were split into two teams, attack, and defense. The DM's on both sides worked together to organize their respective armies, with the players being the defacto trump cards up each DM's sleeve, the goal being to capture/defend the castle within the middle of a mountain range.\n\nEach DM was limited to two types of enemy, being one of the defense GM's, i went for undead (my personal favourite) and constructs, while my friend went for aberrations (his personal favourite) and giants. We all also got access to elementals, which was nice. He wasn't that creative when it came to using the monsters, but he was really good at making them, and he'd often ask me for tips on how to use the beasts in his pen effectively, even ran a private one on one session with him to showcase what some of the monsters he had could really do, the guy was my protege. For simplicity sake, his name shall be Wendell.\n\nThis was early on in the conflict, with the enemy crusade having finally made their way to the outskirts of the mountain country, intent on ending the ritual happening at the dead center. The enemy army consisted of plant monsters, magical beasts, humanoids of all kinds and fucking dragons (damn you mark, always gotta be the power gamer.). Naturally, we the defenders weren't going to simply stand by and let them plot out an attack on us without harrying them a little, so from the top of the mountains, giants and massive constructs launched huge boulders down upon the campsite after they had finished setting it up, targeting things like the medical tents, food stores and armouries that were discovered via the use of scry spells and dopplegangers pretending to be soldiers. This didn't last long though, because the dragon host soon flew up and started to attack the squads of rock tossers. Thankfully, one of the defending parties was there.  \n\n\nThis was my group, it consisted of an anti-paladin human, the classic orc 'blood for the blood god' barbarian, an elven necromancer (multi classed into cleric and wizard), and a monk infected with the ghoul virus. They all had pretty decent ranged attacks, even the monk was able to fire ki at the dragons from afar for a while, but it quickly became obvious that this was definitely a time to retreat...or it would have been if the barbarian, being the only one not doing that much damage, got pissed off, kicked a giant in the foot and demanded he was thrown at a dragon.\n\nObeying his generals commands, a giant scooped him up and shot-putted him right at the biggest, meaniest looking one, nat twenty on the throw. So the barb was now a homing missile, raging, frothing at the mouth while darth mauling his double axe like a madman, screaming \"blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, skin for the skin dinner table cloth!\". By all rights he should have died, by all rights we should have laughed as he fell to his death...He rolled 4 nat 20's in a row, the first to grapple onto the dragon, and the next three for his full round attack across it's back, he killed one of the biggest dragons, who's CR was 3 above his, down in one round, granted i had it at half health due to it being pelted with boulders, but he murdered it to kingdom come.\n\nIt didn't even stop there, as he then leapt off of it and landed on the next one, taking a little longer this time, but he still brought it down with the help of some thrown boulders and the rest of the party. This happened three more times before he had nothing left to jump onto and leapt from the dragon, splattering himself across the ground like a spilled jar of strawberry jam. He would have never been able to do it if he didn't have a set of boots that let him jump the same distance as his movement speed, but five dragons at the cost of one PC barbarian? That was apparently worth it to the guy.",

        "text": "Greetings Lord Manshoon,It is I your Right Hand, Elite Shore. Here’s my newest report.\n\nIn the morning we all ate breakfast and planned out day. We agreed we should travel in groups to make sure we’re safe within the city. We then proceeded to move forward with our day. Our first stop was the temple, mostly to learn but also to keep up an appearance of greatness within the city. So when we all went inside Mazgorn went to a Priestess to gather information while I went to a donation dish and threw in 30 gold and a platinum piece.\n\nI then proceeded to learn about the deities approve for worship over here. Seiryu, Suzaku, Byakko, and Genbu. I took a liking to Suzaku because he reminded me of food and Byakko because he reminds me of Kin. I chose to take up both of them. You can never worship to many deities. Though my worship is different than others. I just talk to them like normal people.\n\nAfter leaving the temple we went to another one to get Veri healed. You see here worship of any other deity is viewed as Heresy and even though Kamenosuke warned all of us about this Veri being himself didn’t listen and got kicked out of the first temple for me a “filthy heretic”. He’s going to himself or worse… me killed.\n\nAfterwards we went to the gate ate some lunch and waited for Dracovich to arrive. Hours pass and he finally does and we return to the inn. While returning to the inn we spoke of our separate journeys and how they went… we went through a storm and he went through a tundra. We have the worst luck. We all ate dinner I then took a bath and went to bed. However… early in the morning I awoke to a noise in the hallway. I opened the doors just enough to peek out into the hallway, just in time to see Veri and Zulnn get dragged out of their room then I see Veri get pointed at and taken away. Accorded to Suka from what she translated for me he was being taken away for worshiping The Raven Queen. Meh I’ll handle this situation in the morning.\n\nWhen I awoke I told everyone that Veri was guardnapped and told everyone we can handle this situation after breakfast. After we ate we proceed to the guard station outside and to retrieve him. When we arrived to the station we tried to talk our way into seeing Veri so we could convince the guards to let him go. However… just as it seemed like we’re about to make progress a rather pathetic looking weak man in royal clothing comes strolling in and basically walks into the room Veri is being held in. We are denied entry.\n\nSo we wait. The next thing I know I hear Veri’s screams. I do nothing. Well until we all heard the unmistakable sound of thunder. So we all rush in and when I say we I mean our group and the guards rush in and see that pathetic noble fool who I’ve learn is the Premiere of this city the second most powerful person!! Near dead on the floor. Damnit Veri. Just… Damnit.\n\nFor the next eight hours we follow Veri as he is covered in chains being guided/dragged by a royal carriage into the higher class area of the city for punishment.\n\nI looked around the higher class area of the city to get a lay of the land and then I returned to the Inn. Once we all arrive at the Inn we gather together to talk about that to do about what I’ve coined “The Tomb of Annihilation”, I then proceeded to try to absorb the powers of the Avatar of Murder and failed, then took a bath and went to bed.\n\nFor the next couple of days I handled trivial matters in the city. Bought a Tanto, five flasks, went back to the inn and got them filled with highly flammable alcohol, and went back to my room and practiced my Lute. Though before I practiced I did send a prayer/message to Heimdall. I need guidance. My time is now.\n\nThe day has come. I neglected to mention in my previous reports that a celebration was happening within The Jade City. I originally planned to frame the one that tortured Veri but I have to accept the fact that Veri got himself into this situation all by himself. So instead I will go to this celebration and have fun if possible. After all Noble Parties can be so boring.\n\nEverything started out well. I was actually having a good time… then… then that pathetic man from before lead Veri in and Veri… oh by The World Tree… Veri… they cut off his fingers and ripped out his tongue. His mouth and eyes were sewn shut and he was covered in that black goopy blood of his. He was forced to crawl on his knees and… that monster started to hack into him a with a sword. Slow and painfully. It went on for minutes but felt like hours. Then the Jade Emperor's Uncle mercy killed Veri so the Premiere would stop. The Premiere has no honor.\n\nRevenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge Revenge\n\nI must have some form of revenge. He will pay in someway for that shameful display.\n\nFor Veri.\n\nWell I need to calm down before I make a scene that wouldn’t be good… Hado/Hecate just turned into a potted plant… just why?\n\nWell just as quickly as it happened it ended. Hado/Hecate is back to normal… or as normal as possible I suppose. Surprisingly I’ve grown to see her as a sort of niece. Much like I see Dracovich as my brother now. Though Hado/Hecate does many a strange thing she does help us out big time. Like how she just pointed out strange activity and helped us discover an attack is about to happen. Hello displaced aggression.\n\nHOLY SMOKES GIANT SPIDERS ARE ATTACKING I THINK LOLTH FOUND ME!!!!!!!!!\n\nI RIPPED ONES FACE OFF WITH JUST MY CLAWS!!!!!!!! I AM AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!Ok… breath… sorry I just got really excited. I’ve never actually used my claws in a fight before but… I sure as Baator gonna start using them now!!\n\nIt was an intense battle and we’re heading back to the Inn but man am I jazzed…. Spiders just erupted from Hado/Hecate's skin… I’m now officially done with this day.\n\nI’ll write again soon.Signed, 𝕰𝖑𝖎𝖙𝖊 𝕾𝖍𝖔𝖗𝖊, Heir of Shore, Viper of The Zhentarim, Right Hand and Adopted Son of Lord Manshoon\n\n(P.S.

        "text": "Greetings Lord Manshoon,\n\nIt is I your Right Hand, Elite Shore. Here’s my newest report.\n\nAs we traveled to the town of Bellastrava by way of carriage I try to practice my new lute… and we told to stop by my companions before I really even started. How ungrateful.\n\nWhen we arrived at Bellastrava I look around only to see the town burned to the ground with only the church made of stone standing. However at the docks we all can easily spot a ship possibly a brigantine in the port of this burned down town. Just what I need, I mean just what we need… we.\n\nAnyway as we made our way through through the ash and soot of Bellastrava we arrived at the ship. This ship… well first of all finding a ship in a burnt down village immediately put me on edge. As we walked up on the deck I once again I had a bad feeling… the deck is clean and pristine. This ship wasn’t here when the village caught fire… I now on edge, who purposely docks at port next to a burnt down village. What worried me next was that the upper deck couldn’t get dirty. Kamenosuke despite me telling him that spitting would the smarter idea considering blood belongs inside your body, cuts his hand and squeezes his hand so blood would drop upon the deck, it simply disappears. So when we started searching below deck I wasn’t exactly caught off guard or surprised to see it was a bloody mess. Just disgusted. However as we made our way further into the ship we come across a truly terrifying sight.\n\nA floating torso… in a room that was basically a lake of blood. She had a scream so loud that my ears started ringing. However after talking to her we discovered she was quite reasonable. All we had to do was figure out what we’re going to offer her as gifts so we could secured passage to the Jade City… also we just had to be the one to sail the ship. So considering the fact that Zulnn was or technically is a Pirate and that I spent a large part of my life aboard a Pirate Ship as the First Mate of The Crimson Tide a group of Pirates known for causing havoc. We knew we could sail. So all that was left was to for us to figure out what we’re going to each offer her.\n\nSo as I steer the ship towards The Jade City all I could hope was that none of us got thrown overboard. After all the sea is a cruel mistress even if I give her all my love. Also I may have made Poseidon made at one point… I’m sure he’s over it! I was like sixteen. So I sail and sail and sail until my shift is over. I let Zulnn know it’s his turn and proceed to go to sleep. Well I don’t sleep per say… I’ve taken to meditating. Building up my mental defences considering the fact I have the soul of a demon in my head, and no I’m not talking about you father hahaha… I’m sorry.\n\nAfter many hours I awoke from my meditative state  to the sound of anchors dropping and the boat rocking. It seems it’s offering time. So as we all gathered in front of her going one at a time we offered her something. Mazgorn went before me so I have no idea what he offered but knowing him it was probably some sort of potion or whatever. However I know exactly what everyone else offered.\n\nKamenosuke offered her a favor, I offered her my eversmoking bottle, my friend Elysium gave her hairsoap, El Fuego gave her a card from the deck of many things, Veri… he accidentally gave her his wolf helmet,  Gregor was going to offer his alchemy jug but I gave him a silver tear drop earring made of a real tear so he could present that to her instead. I gave up a silver tear drop earring made of a real tear… something crafted by the best jewelry crafter before his passing… just so Gregor could keep that jug. Never say I’ve never done anything for this group.\n\nAfterwards the anchors rose and we once again set sail towards The Jade City.\n\nFor the next two days everything was pretty calm upon the open sea. A few of my groups members goofed around having arm wrestling contests while I was up in the crows nest practicing my lute next to a skellington.\n\nOn the third day everything was going well until the mast fell due to something hitting the mass at an incredibly fast speed and plowing into the side of the ship. Kamenosuke and I highly concerned about that was and about the current structural integrity of the ship went to investigate. So as we went into the ship we see what was damaged and to what did it we found that whatever it was put a hole into the floor of the ship and it revealed a rather large pool of blood. So being the brilliant person that I am I tied a rope around my waist and dived into the blood.\n\nAs I swam deeping into the blood to find what hit us I suddenly found myself in a dark room literally on the other side of the blood. How there is an room underneath a pool of blood I’m just blame on magic. However as I started looking for the cause low and behold I discover it was Hado/Hecate who not only looked different but must have flown a long distance considering we left em in Nordime. Makes sense though. When Hado/Hecate is around chaos follows. It didn’t help when that he was still being possessed by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. After a whole bunch of chaos happened I prayed to Heimdall that tomorrow would be better.\n\nAs I took my shift for the night the owner of the ship floats out from below deck looks around and… well I tried to tell her it wasn’t my fault but the fault of a ancient forgotten deity but she didn’t listen. All she did was ignore me and head below deck. As my shift ended I woke up Zulnn and went to sleep.\n\nAs our fourth day at sea started I wake up to find the ship intact and Veri’s Hands missing… okay look. I’m tired alright! This group can sometimes truly crushes you soul after awhile. However I will still go on. It’s the 30th of Hammer. Midwinter and also my Red Letter Day. I am now thirty-two… My goals seem far and almost unachievable but… I must not give up.\n\nJust like I though… MY RED LETTER DAY IS CURSED!!! First we sailed right into a horrible storm and had to fight for our lives. We quickly sprung into action quickly tying down the ropes, batten down the hatches and steer the ship to safety!! I shouted. After tying down as many ropes as possible I climb the mast to try and get to the crows nest and help spot a safe way out of this storm all while trying to keep us all calm. However I seem to be the only one trying to do my job correctly. Seriously!! VERI IS MISSING HIS HANDS AND HE TRIED TO TRY ROPE! WITHOUT HANDS!!!!!!!!\n\nFor the next two hours we fought the weather until we were able to get to calmer seas. Why did you give me this mission? These people might bring the end of the world before they actually make a positive impact on it… the storm set us back about twenty days… on a trip that was supposed to take ten days… I’m so tired.\n\nAs we continued sailing we spot a rocky spire like structure with something zipping across it. As well as something or a group of somethings creating a large silhouette under the water.\n\nTurns out it was a large school of jellyfish. How do I know this? Greggor caught one, it then proceeded to latch onto this face and nearly killed him. What in the world is wrong with these people. I mean I’ve grown to see most of them as family in the short time I’ve known them but… I feel like rendering them permanently unable to use their legs would be a favor to not only the world but themselves. Well not Elysium, Kamenosuke, Mazgorn, or Dracovich. They’re fine.\n\nAlmost as soon as the jellyfish thing finished we came under attack by Blue Wyverns. We all fought our hardest and won but… we lost someone. El Fuego… he died. Killed by one of the Blue Wyverns. To honor him I will carve the heart out of the one that killed him, roast it and eat it.\n\nDays pass on this ship since El Fuego passed. Hado/Hecate and Veri fought. Like a literal fight, swords and magic. Growing more tired of the pointless fights this group has I grabbed two of the bones of the dead Wyvern and started carving them into daggers. Afterwards I continued to teach myself to play the Lute as I had been doing this whole trip.\n\nWhen we finally made it to the port of The Jade City we all see why it has this name. The city itself glissens with a shiny green thanks to the reflection of the sun off the ocean. Truly a beautiful sight. The city itself is by far the largest I’ve seen on Ranur. I look forward to exploring it.\n\nWhen we got off the ship I look around and immediately notice a pair of hands hanging on a pole in the port town. Oh Raven Queen love a corpse it’s freaking Veri’s hands. Apparently people think of them as lucky charms and in order to get them I must replace them with something… So I grab another Wyvern bone and they say it would be a suitable replacement. So I climb up grab Veri’s hands replace them with the bone. I then see Veri trying to pay about 30 orphans to climb up and grab his hands… I don’t think he thinks things through sometime. Also they’re are stealing his stuff without him noticing… I’m not going to even help him with that..\n\nSo after I give each child a gold piece so they can eat I ask where the best tavern/inn in the city is so I can go to it. I learn it’s called The Jade Ki-ran and I go on my way.\n\nWhen we reach the city gate we were stopped and searched. We had many things confiscated from us but I’ll find a way to get them back… or not. I got to keep all my things so I don’t really care.\n\nAs we began walking through the city I look around and realize while this city might be larger than Nordime it’s more restrictive. No freedom of religion and far more darker alleys… This place is dangerous and needs to be infiltrated. I can’t create a base here unless we make noble house here too. Also they speak two languages I don’t understand. Low Oriental and High Oriental.\n\nWhen we made it to the gate of the distract where I was informed The Jade Ki-rin is located I was rejected entry for not looking important enough. Snobs. So we had to ask about a different place to stay and get this. We were directed to the Kamenosuke Inn. What the actual Baator. That prat has an Inn named after him. Not fair. Turns out he’s royalty. I don’t have time to process this right now I need to take a bath.\n\nAfter we entered the Inn I hit with a smell… it smells like someone familiar. I immediately look around and… no way… she's Pavuu’s right hand basically… we fought demons with each other… she died on the Ziggurat… Suka. HOLY SMOKES SHE’S ALIVE!!!!\n\nI walk up to her and say hello and she’s just like I remember her. She still very pretty and smells of nature and power. However she also was raised by wolves and smells a bit like one to. No offence to her of course. I do wonder how shes alive… wait… she also smells a bit like death but… she’s not undead. I would be able to tell. What the Baator is going on!!!\n\nI ask her if she would like to join me while I explore the more dangerous areas of the city. Surprisingly she says yes. While it was true I wanted to explore the city I was actually looking for where they take the contraband. So I can pillage the groups stuff back. No father it wasn’t a date. I’m still looking for Saphirithrix. Yes I know it’s been years but still. While we walked I asked her how she got here and how shes alive and she told me she has no idea. She just woke up here.\n\nAs we walked into a shady area we surrounded by around 40 thugs or some sort of gang. They wanted my teeth. So considering the fact I wasn’t alone and couldn’t fight like an animal I choose to most logical answer. I grab Suka and flew us out of there. I barely escaped with my life. I flew us to safety and we proceed walk back to the Kamenosuke inn, one of us covered in silver blood. I need another bath.\n\nAfter my bath I asked for some stationary so I could send you a letter with a request. I’ll include it with this report. It has just a few request that should make my mission here easier.\n\nI’ll write again soon.Signed, 𝕰𝖑𝖎𝖙𝖊 𝕾𝖍𝖔𝖗𝖊, Heir of Shore, Viper of The Zhentarim, Right Hand and Adopted Son of Lord Manshoon",

        "text": "Huge wall of text, prepare yourselves \n\nSome back story. I’m homebrewing a campaign for my players. A arsonist warlock who is the succubus king (long story), a twice transsexual mute bard (longer story), and a half-orc paladin.\n\nAnyway, a few session in the campaign I told my players that they had met the BBEG. Which wasn’t a lie they had met him, however this became a huge discussion topic until they (between themselves) agreed it was one of two NPCs. \n\nPaul:\nA conscripted college student who was the one that was the party was working for. He orchestrated pretty much every main story action the party has taken. \n\nI had revealed (accidentally) had an intelligence of 30 and was a much higher level than all of the players. \n\nThe High Priest: \n\nThe local bishop of the imperial religion. \n\nPaul works for him, and he had asked the party to report to him about Paul’s actions and well being without him. \n\nTo my dismay they got very close actually, and pretty much guessed the ended encounter. \n\nLater on in the campaign it is revealed that Paul is actually undead and has taken all of the dragon tomes for himself to seek out the well of life (sorry, bad at context). When the players approach the well of life it is filled with bodies, undead, and even dying companions. \n\nThey then come to the well itself and find Paul. He asks the party to gift him the final part of the dragon soul so that he can take control of the well of life. The high priest then shows up behind the party with the minercinaries (minority mercenaries) and says they were searching for Paul to arrest him. \n\nThey players must now choose between Paul and the High Priest. \n\nPaul says that he can stop the undead with the complete dragon soul, and that the High Priest worships the Old One and is a warlock. \n\nThe High Priest (Kevin) says that Paul is undead and that he will take control of the undead and kill everyone. \n\nThere is more to the story than this but this is the gist. The High Priest is the BBEG, and there is more evidence than I have given pointed to that and two of my players had picked up on that. The transsexual and Mr. Succubus. However, the orc was not convinced. \n\nThis typically isn’t a problem because it goes to a vote. However the player who wasn’t convinced it was the High Priest is also in debate club, and is really really good at debate club. \n\nHe drew out the debate against Paul for an hour bringing up evidence and quotes from all over the campaign. We stopped to eat and then the debate (getting pretty heated) carries into dinner, as it is debated for a second hour. \n\nI don’t live alone, and my roommate had two friends over. As the debate is on a stand still with Mr. Succubus threatening to blow up the whole well. My players brought this debate to my roommate and his friends. We now have a 3v3 as the argument continues for the THIRD hour. \n\nIn the end they chose correctly and Mr. Succubus died and the transsexual was banished to hell, but god the debate was long. \n\nTl:Dr:\n\nMy player is in debate and drew out the argument for the wrong choice for three hours.

        "text": "The party had been taking part in a community wide defend/attack the base style campaign, four groups in all, two parties defending a large castle in the centre of a mountain range, the other two had to try and get to the castle, kill the ruler, and sit one of their players on the throne. The four DMs (myself included) organized our resources like an actual war effort while using the players as our trump cards, slowly ramping things up til the final push.  \n\n\nMy group was on the defending side, and since the alignment for the castles ruler was lawful evil, that meant i was allowed to use undead...which meant the attacking side rarely, if ever got a chance to get beyond the mountain ranges, because of the way i had the undead placed about and how they functioned. We all took turns DMing each group depending on what their plan of action was, but usually, it was the defending DM against one of the attacking parties, and visa versa. I DM'd my own group when it came to downtime, doing stuff within the valley and fighting off other enemies from beyond the valley with the other DM's go ahead. It was chaotic, but fun.  \n\n\nAnyway, the attackers had been steadily ground down against the mountains defences, effectively drawing their holy crusade to a halt, forcing them to rely on tactics other than mass combat and overwhelming numbers. One of the attacking groups was chosen to do a lord of the rings and take a small party through a long and undisclosed path to get to the enemy stronghold and end this once and for all. Their DM had loaded them with some narly magical artifacts and was even sending some NPC clerics to deal with the main problem they had been coming up against time and again: the undead hordes.\n\nThe session was duo DM'd, with me acting as your standard DM, with my co-pilot acting as the NPC's and a few other things, effectively just acting as party back up and additional rules aide. It went by as normal for a bit, them squashing undead and the like while slowly progressing through the land, until they got to the shivering river. It was more of a very wide stream, about thirty feet across, two foot deep at its middle. What made it special was the fact it acted as the half way point across the mountains and was traditionally used as a circuit for a group of water elemental to patrol the band. But when they got there, no elementals, in fact, not even a sound. The group slowly tried to cross the water, and when one tried to organize it, he realized that he couldn't speak, they were in a large silence spell. \n\nThey later learned that they had missed a skeleton undead while passing through the mountains, who had sent a message, which prompted the ruler of the castle to dispatch a unique squad for the task. They came from the other defending DM's tool cabinet, aberrations. Within the first surprise round, several homebrew modified dopplegangers brought down the NPC clerics with sneak attacks, having stepped out of their invisibility spells to shank them, these guys couldn't shape shift, only make themselves invisible at will. Normally this group would be fine, since the last fight against these things had been won by using their ears and aoe spells, unluckily for them, the dopplegangers had learned from their mistakes, especially in regards to spellcasters. Instead of shanking the parties wizard (who had dispel prepared and could cast truesight prepared), one of the dopplegangers grappled him and tried to drown him in that small amount of water. He had such low constitution that he wouldn't last long.\n\nIt was then that something struck me, why bother going in for regular combat with these guys against this party, when i can really exploit the enviroment and their skillsets? There were 6 dopplegangers in all, one stuck on the wizard, the enemy party consisted of 4 PCs, and a single NPC was still alive out of the original 4. The NPC was dropped quickly enough, but the fun didn't start until all the players were in the water trying to rescue their friend. One doppleganger died to the barbarian, but did so to lure him into the deepest part of the river before Two dopplegangers grappled the barbarian at once, pinning him under the water, leaving the paladin and the PC cleric to fight against the dopplegangers. These dopplegangers all had levels in rogue, they all had the rogue talent accurate poisoner, one poison in particular caused insanity for exactly one round, but with accurate poisoner, it would last for three. The last two chucked poison darts at the cleric, and while he was fumbling around trying to not blast anyone while going mad, they dog piled the paladin, who still had full HP, and set about drowning him as well.\n\nThe wizard died shortly after the paladin started to get choked. We were using slightly altered rules for drowning than the usual, in that you had less time to remain conscious underwater if someone is specifically trying to choke and drown you. So the wizard, who had 8 con, had 16 rounds where he would have been fine, this dropped by 4 every round because he took an action, was being choked, and a round past. The doppleganger snapped his neck when he passed out in a coup. When he died, that doppleganger went on to the insane and flailing cleric, repeating the same process.\n\nThe cleric died after a few rounds of struggling, and it would have been a TPK if it weren't for the barbarian rolling a high score to resist the grapple, then proceeded to get up, and murder the two choking the paladin. The rest of the dopplegangers fled after that, there work wasn't done, but the damage was severe enough to call a retreat, they had lost the advantage they had started with and there was no point in fighting to the death. The barb and paladin collected the bodies, shoved them into a bag of holding, and left, returning the way they came at full sprinting speed, the paladin even taking off his armour so he could move faster.\n\nThe CR of the encounter was calculated as even odds for a group of 8, but let it never be said that just because the CR says it's even, doesn't mean that it will be fair.",

Here is my next report father.\n\nAs I awoke in the morning I greeted El Fuego and thanked him for allowing me to stay in his magic barrack… well I think it’s magic.\n\nI needed to go shopping. I had plans to better myself and keep this team of misfits safe even though I know for a fact I’m not the strongest one on this team… yet. So I ordered a brand new set of custom studded leather armor, commissioned a weapon specifically a custom silver short sword I plan on having imbued the divine energy Ysgard, and a Lute… What? I wanted to learn how to play so I could comfort my team in times of need or to earn a spot of coin if we need it.\n\nMy first stop was the fletcher so I could order my custom studded leather armor, black of course for stealthy roguelike reasons. There I met the tiefling lass who works on all the armor, she was quite jittery but very adorable, kinda childlike though. I spoke to her and told her what I wanted and she seemed to get excited about the idea of a new job. I paid outright for my armor and told her I’d pick it up when I could. Next stop with the Weaponsmith.\n\nOn my way to the Weaponsmith I took in my surroundings. This city… The City of Nordime… it’s truly a monument to unity. Everywhere I look I see people of every race and kind. It brings me hope that one day everywhere will be like this. I do think infiltrating this place would be easy. In fact I doubt anyone would care if we made an additional base here. Well as long as we do it under the guise of a noble house moving into the city.\n\nWhen I arrived at the Weaponsmith I ran into Kamenosuke, the returning original member of this band of misfits. We both wanted to acquire a custom weapon it seems. Given how he acts I don’t really care about what he got but I ordered my custom silver short sword. It has my family’s motto on it in elvish. The one my parents chose to ignore. Mors Aut Vita Decora. Death or a Life of Honor. Hehe I know, those that can tell I’m a Rogue will be confused as to why I have this written upon my blade, and that confusion will bring me joy. The blade will be named Hidegnawer. Now before I go buy my Lute… I am in desperate need of a bath so the bathhouse will be the next stop.\n\nAs I reached the bathhouse the first thing see are guards outside the building. Confused I entered and low and behold is see Mazgorn, Elysium, and Greggor at the center of all this trouble. FOR HEIMDALL’S SAKE!!!! What is with this group am I right? Always causing trouble, ruining my good name. Only one this to do, and you know what that is right? That’s write! I walked right past them and entered the public bathhouse all while pretending I don’t know them. Now I know what you’re thinking. Public bathhouse? Why not get a private one? Well I’m not ashamed of my looks and neither are the ladies. Also the guards were out front because Mazgorn, Elysium, and Greggor destroyed the five private bathing quarters. \n\nInside… I run into Sorrell and he is not happy to see. Well actually he is never happy to see anyone in the group I travel with and sadly that transferred to me as well. However after letting him know I had nothing to do with the situation here and that I also was having a great day until this happen we started have a civil conversation. Actually we got along rather well! We shared adventuring tales and he gave me some advice about never agreeing to create a city with the people you adventure with. We continued to relax. Then all of a sudden then only being in the world that can sneak up on me did just that. Alisa, a Tabaxi Rogue as well, though I’m guessing she’s a thief considering how nimble and elegant her hands and fingers are. Oh I suppose I should mention that Both Sorrell and Alisa and Council members of the city of Nordime. I thought it would have been a good idea to befriend them… also because they’re pretty cool. Well after a bit more friendly conversation with Sorrell he leaves and I wish him a good day, leaving me and Alisa alone in the public bathhouse. \n\nI strike up a conversation with Alisa telling her about my time on battlefield and how I once was the apprentice to a powerful Archmage even though I knew nothing of magic. All the while she moved closer and closer to me eventually ending up on my lap, then as I was speaking she places her finger on my lips and tells me to shush, She looks around almost like someone was watching us, turns to me and gives me a quick peck on the lips rushes out of the public bath and runs out of the building all as she dressed herself. She shouts goodbye and I’m all by myself. Well I guess I was right, she’s a thief. She stole a kiss from me. I won’t lie though… that kiss wasn’t unpleasant. In fact I rather enjoyed it. I wouldn’t mind laying with her… even though that might end in the possibility of a new Tabaxi life. Well never mind that for now. After my bath I went to by my new Lute.\n\nAt the General Store I meet a Warforged named Shelf… yes his name is Shelf and he has the brains of one to. For you see when I spoke to him I had a simple request. A Lute. That simple request ended with him smashing two lutes and bringing me the remains. Then its creator or master stepped in and gave me a lute for free. So Feeling bad that it ended like this I also purchased three mid-grade healing potions before leaving to return to the inn. I know I know… You’re a Rogue with a conscience. That’s weird I get it. I live by my codes as well as the codes of The Zhentarim.\n\nAfter returning to The Serpents Claw Inn I am informed I have a package. When I see it I know it’s from you. When I grab it… Well I’m sure you know I was transported to my mindscape where I see you’ve been redecorating, and yes… I won’t disappoint you, oh by the way I understand the need for secrecy but next time you send me a letter with instructions in multiple languages can you oh I don’t know make sure I understand what I’m reading instead of you making me rush out and waste two hundred gold pieces on a Scroll of Comprehend Languages, because of you I had to run around the city! First I went to Lycanderous’s tower only to find it’s invisible and I couldn’t find the entrance. Then I had to go to a store and waste my money just to find out your having me watched. Now I don’t mind that I have an additional agent watching my back but I do question the need to send these reports in now. Now then I need to eat, sleep, and send this letter out. Just remember Father. If you try to have me killed… I’ll ruin you. Just as I promised when you adopted me. We’re leaving to Bellastrava in the morning to find or commandeer a ship so we can set sail to The Jade City. Apparently Dracovich went there to find his wife and child. I’ll write again soon.\n\nSigned, 𝕰𝖑𝖎𝖙𝖊 𝕾𝖍𝖔𝖗𝖊, Heir of Shore, Viper of The Zhentarim, Right Hand and Adopted Son of Lord Manshoon",

        "text": "We've all done it, every DM has one story about this magic item, it usually ends horribly, but I was determined to make this work, even if it caused problems in other ways that I was not anticipating.\n\nThe party got their hands on a deck of many things from a casino, they won it off of a poor loser who had been having terrible luck ever since he pulled a few cards from it, when asked, he told them that a specter now hunted him, he had lost everything he once owned and was just really unlucky. I had basically had NPC's use the deck, removing some of the cards before the players got their hands on it.\n\nThey finished their business before taking the rest of the day off to discuss what to do with this deck of wonderful fortune and horrible misfortune. Well, it did not begin with them pulling cards, it began with them debating if they should, then who should. This is where things went south.  The party was made up of neutrals, goods, and a single lawful, that lawful being lawful evil. They talked for ages, then argued, then the barbarian punched the wizard, who promptly cast finger of death on the barb, then all hell broke loose.\n\nThe Barb was the first to draw a card during combat, he got the ace of diamonds, aka the vazier, which meant that he knew answer to his next dilemma, unfortunately, his next dilemma was the fighters axe coming at his face for what would most assuredly be a critical hit. I allowed it to function like a moment of prescience spell, and added it to his AC, which allowed him to not die for a single turn of combat because no one could hit him. But he did drop the deck...the wizard drew the two of swords, which meant that if he kills the next thing he fights, he gains a level, he was currently fighting the barb, so he now had all the more reason to murder him brutally.\n\nThe other two members of the party were just trying to keep them apart at this point, with the cleric healing both of them repeatedly so neither died, while the fighter kept slapping the barb for a quarter of his HP per turn. They told me they were hoping for his rage to burn out, but it wasn't gonna happen, not with the level he was at. So the fighter took his turn, and got a major magical item. I had four item cards prepared, one for each player, and i let him randomly choose which one of the four they'd get, he pulled the best/worst one, by that i mean it was the best one for the fighter, and the worst one for the situation, it was a sword of mauling, it regens the wielders health per hit, equal to the targets level, and deals additional damage based on that level, also causes additional damage when hitting soft fleshy targets, so giants, people, wild animals, etc. He was able to bring the barbarian and wizard down with this sword after a few more rounds before they settled on bringing the wizard back to life and trying again, the barb was alive but just hanging on...Until the barb used a slight of hand check to draw the five of swords, where one of your friends turns against you I didn't even get to think about who had turned against him from my roster of NPC's before the cleric launched herself at him with a mace and fire hands. The fighter dropped her as well before just taking the deck and walked over to the fireplace to toss it in...but he pulled it out and looked it over, from top to bottom, thus looking right at the void card there, causing it to activate. he fell into a coma, with his soul sealed away in the plane of water surrounded by megalodons.\n\nTo top it off, the barbarian, thinking that the best way to solve this would be to keep drawing, announced that he'd draw all of the remaining cards, since he figured out that most of the bad ones were gone now. he drew...the two of clubs, he then lost 1d4\\+2 intelligence. He had an int score of five. So he drew it, and promptly died of retardation, forgetting how to breath.\n\nI just looked at them all like they were a bunch of loonies before asking them if they'd like to trade in the deck of many things, retcon the entire thing, and just say they got the sword of mauling instead. We agreed to never use the deck again...and to keep the sword, with the caveat that it was now intelligent, and lawful evil.",

        "text": "**Skip to** ***\"STORY PROPRER\"*** **or** ***\"THE EVENT NO. 1\"*** **if you don't care what characters we play. For a little bit information about system we play go to** ***\"SYSTEM INFORMATION\"*** **at the end.**\n\nOkay so a little backstory.\n\nOriginally there were 2 of us players (because 3rd one didn't have time) and GM.\n\nI play Gradomir, a Redanian warrior who \"just happened to\" be in City of Maribor when the Duke needed help of someone discreet and prefarably someone who was not connected to him. I was a spy.\n\nMy friend played Bernard, a sadistic mage who lived in Maribor but was generaly trusted by Duke. Oh and he liked to curse people. Keep that in mind.\n\nLater our third friend would join with his dwarf, Gundab (I think), an adventurer who for some reason knew elven and had a childrens book written in elven. Oh and he wanted to meet dryads.\n \n##The Story Proprer\n\nThe task given to us by Duke was as follows: find his lover and a daughter she ran off with. Not a simple taks, given that this was all the information we recived. \nFortunately, GM gave us a hand in form of court mage of Duke, Margo. And since GM described her as, imo, attractive, I decided that Gradomir would fall for her.\n\nOver the course of next few sessions we managed to, miracouosly, track down the women (it turned out they were dryads), meet character of our friend, make deal with dryads to return women and return daughter (Dukes lover was assinated as we left the forest).\n\nWe got into the forest thanks to Gundab who, and I shit you not, read the childrens book in elven so well to the dryads that guarded the forest that they actually took him into deep forest and he managed to talk them into letting us in. Better then alternative, I suppose (which was to burn forest down). In the forest itself, the head-dryad prothecised that the daughter of Duke would \"save the forest and die\". Since then my character vowed to protect the girl... just to prove the old hag that there is no such thing as \"destiny\".\n\nIn any case once out of forest we delivered \"princess\" to Duke and had to explain, why there is a random dwarf with us. Fun fact: Duke had once a legitimate daughter but she died (or was assasinated, whatever). Afterwards we witnessed as Margo tried to brainwash the girl into thinking that she is that legitimate daughter so she could be used for political marriage with Redanian somebody... To no effect. That's where I left our mage with Margo to deal with it.\n\nBig mistake.\n\n##The Event no. 1\n\nYou see, our mage picked up on my character's crush on Margo so he decided to ruin it. He told her a story, that my character once raped and killed a girl (that he was supposed to be betrothed to, I think) and then left her remains in the forest. I was not present when he did that, but Bernards player supposedly came up with a story so fast and told it in such chilling and convincing way, that GM told him to roll. Her rolled either 99 or 100, so a catastrophisc failure. Here is a thing, he was not rolling on whether or not he would convince Margo, no. He was rolling for curses and failure would mean he accidentally curses me. So all lights went out, the storm started brewing and my character started to experience more and more vivid nightmares every night.\n\nUntill one day.\n\nYou see, the Duke was an idiot and he kept all the things about his illegitimate daughter (who finally started responding to name of legitimate princess) written down in documents. So of course they got stolen. Here is the thing, thief wanted to give the documents to Redanian emmisary that was on his way to Maribor. This was, as you can imagine, not to Dukes liking and he requested that we catch the thief and return documents. It was also in my interest to get my hands on these documents so I could send them directly to Redanian spymaster (my true employer). The chase took all day and in the end, our mage desroyed the documents, much to my dismay. Just as we finshed last of our enemies and my \"friend\" healed me the midnight struck.\n\nThe thick fog gathered around us and from it we saw a stilluette of a man on a horse. As he drew near we saw that he was... Redanian emissary. He was half dead and most importantly horrified. At first I was surprised, he was supposed to be with halth a thousand bodhyguards after all. A small army! Then, we saw *her*. It was a banshee. As it quickly turned out my weapons are quite ineffective I tried to run but she grabbed onto me! She was about to kill me when... Bernard stopped her. He talked to her and told her that we would bring her true killer to justice. She agreed but only if: we would bring her killer onto her grave, he would cry a tears of regret there, after that I was supposed to kill him and Bernard (or somebody who knows burial rituals but he was a best pick) would say the burial words. Oh, and we had 28 days to do that or I was dead.\n\nAnd so concludes the first of the Series of Unfortunate Rolls but believe me, it all goes downhill from there.\n\nTell me if you liked it. I will probably post more in the near future but this is already long enough.\n\n##SYSTEM INFORMATION\n\nMy friends and I are playing homebrew hybrid of Call of Cthulhu, Cyberpunk 2020 and  a smidgen of original Witcher tabletop RPG. The setting is Witcher universe. Rolls are d100s, the lower the better. I'll also take oportunity to brag that I made the magic system from srcatch, even though I'm not GM.\n",

        "text": "D&amp;D 5e, though this story could be from any tabletop adventure.\n\nI like door traps. They're funny!\n\nIn particular, I have a door trap that consists of a normal door lock, but if the lock is picked or compromised in any way, a small dagger will spring out of the lock. This can cut up the lockpicker's delicate fingers, or even take out an eye. It's especially great, because the dagger reloads itself, and is ready to spring back out during a second lockpicking attempt.\n\nIt is a running joke in my campaigns that every single dungeon has a \"dagger-lock\" in the doors.  It doesn't matter if it's within the inaccessible vaults of Erebus, the fabled gatehouse of Shangri-La, or the town hall jail cells... \n\nSomebody, somewhere has made a goddamned fortune selling these dagger-locks to every goddamned dungeon builder ever... Important to note, that this name \"Dagger-lock\" organically grew out of my players' name for them.\n\nOne of my players REALLY began to hate door traps, especially dagger locks! He **hated** them! ...Probably because he was a crappy lockpicker, and he got stabbed a lot.\n\nIncidentally, his character grew up as a street urchin. He has no clear memories of his adolescence or childhood... He gave me permission to \"Do whatever you want with that\".\n\nWell, one night, they had to meet a shady individual at the abandoned \"Daggerlock Manor\". The gatehouse outside this mansion depicted a hand skewered by a dagger.\n\nHe, of course, forgot to check the door for locks, and got stabbed. Everyone laughed, as he realized the significance of \"Daggerlock Manor\" and the engraving on the door.\n\nUpon realizing where he was, he went on a rant...\n\n**\"FUCK THIS DAGGERLOCK GUY! FUCK THE INVENTOR OF THIS TRAP! Fuck his family, fuck his wife's family! Fuck all the gold they made on this! I'm going to get a Chronomancer to send me back in time so I can Terminate this motherfucker by repeatedly kicking his dad in the nuts! I will raze this manor to the ground, and piss on the ashes! Nobody will dare speak the name of the Daggerlock family!\"**\n\nHe cooled down. The party went inside, and were given instructions on how to break into a vault belonging to a \"Nueromancer\". They were to find the memory orb of one \"Dale Daggerlock\". Their shady contact was hoping to acquire the secret designs of the dagger-lock.\n\nThey run the dungeon and get to the vault, full of white luminescent memory orbs. They pocket a handful of them, and locate Dale Daggerlock's memory orb.\n\nUpon touching this memory orb, Brock was flooded with memories of his childhood, and his loving father \"Dag Daggerlock\"; inventor of the famed dagger-locks.\n\n[Clip of the reveal. I'm giggling and losing my shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPlL-FD7XDE)",

        "text": "There will always be that one guy in the party who will make a deal with a devil, sometimes for in character reasons, but it's just as likely that the player is ok with it so long as the benefit outweighs the cost, or just wants to fuck the game over for the laugh of it.\n\nMid way through a campaign, the group were going through a palace in the middle of a beautiful jungle, everything around this castle was made entirely of gold, actual solid gold. The walls were gold, the carpets were gold, the servants were gold, the animals were gold, a small child they found frozen in the middle of a hallway was gold, all shiny yellow. They slowly made their way through it all, fighting the only living things inside the building, demons, pushing their way all the way up to the palace throne room where they encountered the only human left alive in the whole place. He sat there stiff as a board, in robes having turned gold long ago, weighing him down on the seat as he sobbed, but he was so dehydrated that no tears came out. Standing at his side was the biggest demon they encountered thus far, a Glabrezu.\n\nThe lord of this place had made a deal with it, in exchange for taking on demons as his servants and allowing them to use this place as their home for a year, he would be granted one wish, he asked to turn anything he desired into gold at a touch. He worded it well, but the demon ignored the \"he desired\" part. A classic midas touch wish gone wrong.\n\nThe Glabrezu made the group another wish granting offer, in exchange for simply taking what they had came here for, and leaving without mentioning this place to anyone for a month, he would grant them a single wish. Naturally 3 out of the 4 said no, but garry, being lawful neutral, figured sure, lets make a deal, we both benefit, and I want something anyway. So he convinced the others to let him make the deal, winking at them knowingly before shaking his hand being granted the immense, overwhelming power of one free use of the wish spell. After this, they killed the demon, and proceeded to kill every other demon in the building before taking what they came for (several dozen books and an artifact). They also killed the man in the throne to spare him from anymore suffering in this world, which caused the castle, and everything inside it to return to normal, except the people, and the plants, they remained solid gold.\n\nIt was while they were leaving that garry made his wish \"I wish for the scepter of ages!\". For those of you who don't know, the scepter of ages is the number one most campaign ruining item, as it allows for time travel, extremely accurate time travel to any specific point in time and to any location. All you have to do is pass a really high DC. Naturally, my first instinct was to give him an ages old scepter that did basically nothing, or a magical rod just to give him some constellation that would eventually damn him as it would be an intelligent item, but if i was a demonically charged wish, that was always going to grant the worst possible outcome, what worse outcome could there be than giving him what he asked for, and letting him kill himself with it?\n\nSo he got the scepter of ages, showed it off to the others, and then proceeded to test it out, he wanted to go to an entirely different time when cyclops ruled the world, but before they became cannibalistic monsters, and snake people ruled the underdark. He rolled, and naturally, landed himself on a big fat nat 2, with a modifer of 10, putting him 28 away from the DC of 40. But I stressed that his character wouldn't know how poorly he botched it, so no funny business about \"getting a bad feeling\" on this. He and the rest of the party walked through, and were promptly deposited into a pre\\-historic dino filled era. They had the scepter of ages for all of two minutes before it randomly teleported away, because when he wished for it, he didn't wish to have it for a specified amount of time. Yes, I was being that mean, but as he had obtained it using a wish spell that always screws you over, this seemed like a decently believable outcome.\n\nNow they were stuck in a time period they knew nothing about, surrounded by animals and monsters they had never seen, on a continent that had ceased to exist, with no way of getting back home, all while under the effects of time travel rules. To their credit, they continued on with the campaign as best they could, the ranger even swapping out her pet wolf for a raptor. With no real way to get back home, they decided to try one of two plans of action. The first was to grind out levels, hit level 18, make the wizard take the wish spell, and have him use it to get them all back home, the second was to head to the site of a crashed alien ship that struck the planet long ago and see if it was there or not now...What they didn't realize was that the space ship was the reason this period of history ended. Ala meteor impact style.\n\nUsing lots of geography and magic, they figured out where it was gonna be and set out in that direction, only to find the crash site empty, with no sign of it what so ever. Instead of hightailing it out of there, they started to dig about, checking the nearby mountains for it, spending days pawing through it all. All the while ignoring the hints i was making about a slowly reddening sky with steadily worse weather conditions.\n\nWhen they finally noticed, the wizard shrugged and prepared a planeshift spell...Which failed. He had a tuning fork for the spell, but the kicker, was that it was attuned to the plane of fire over several million years into the future. They could have tried something else like teleport, but the wizard, in his ignorance, failed to prepare anything of the sort, even though they probably could have gotten themselves safe with it. So the campaign ended right there and then, with the party being smashed into a pile of charred mush in the most extreme case of rocks fall, everyone dies.\n\nThe rest of the group sort of vetoed garry from future games after he screwed them all over that badly, I will admit I made a few poor choices to, but when you are purposefully ruining the campaign for a laugh, a line needs to be drawn.",

        "text": "This was probably one of the most bizarre campaigns I ran. It all started with two days without sleep, finishing planescape torment not too long ago and a weeb friend of mine never shutting up about naruto.\n\nIt was supposed to be an easy job, I had billed the campaign to them as such, hinting that it would probably spiral beyond the standard affair, leading to the real concept the party wanted to take on, a mega dungeon. For those at home wondering, it was a party of all humans, two men, two women, the classic fighter, rogue, cleric, wizard set\\-up. They were part of an expedition to this mountain island that had randomly popped up a month ago, with the rest of the crew being a mix of adventurers, scholars and government figures.\n\nThey landed on the island and had some time to poke around the shoreline while the spellcasters set up an inital base camp with repeated castings of stone wall and the like. What struck them as odd was the total lack of plant, or animal life. The pebble beach was made up of dull glass marbles, obsidian chunks and bone white stone, the larger boulders were all smooth and had large holes which the wind whistled through, playing an eerie tune that blended with the sea waves. Continuing on, the ground leading up to the island was charred, the mud itself having been burned and mingled with what looked like ash and lava, there were still no plants, and the only sign of animal life, were bones, thousands of corpses, all heaped about the place, in varying sizes and shapes. Their first reaction as a group, knowing how their encounters went with undead in previous campaigns, and my taste for using them, was to turn around and run back to the camp site.\n\nThat night, while everyone took shifts guarding the camp, the dead rose. They were indeed approached by undead, a whole host of them, all standing just outside the range of the wizards longest ranged spells, staring right at the site. They never attacked, nor did they close in, they just stood there, pointing their long, bony fingers before leaving an hour before the sunrise. The next day, all the skeletons had returned to their resting places, with the rogue rolling well enough to realize that they had returned to the exact same positions as before. This time the group, now accompanied by a few others, made their way beyond what they eventually discovered was a ring of skeletons circling the mountains base, all of them facing the same direction, towards the center. The mountain itself was a towering black cone, with a sharp peak at the very top, they couldn't really figure out whether it was made, of it originated from another plane, all they did note was that the bottom was resting upon a plate of sorts, supported by thick, squat pillars with stair cases, the light of the sun barely reaching more than maybe 300ft during mid day, though through math they figured out that they'd be able to see much further in during early morning or sunset as the angle would shine it right through. Still no enemies in sight, they studied the architecture a while before heading deeper in.\n\nThe further into the first layer they went, the more life they saw, black mold clinging to the pillars, insects skittering about...and a horde of undead skeletons falling from the pillars in an ambush. The fight was close, but the party won, and deduced that these must have been the skeletons they had seen last night, one of them even made the leap in logic that the skeletons outside must have all been killed when exposed to sunlight, with the remainder of them having managed to survive underneath the mountain due to the shade. This final puzzle piece fell into place and they figured out where the mountain came from, the shadow plane.\n\nWhile there are many tales from this mountain, eventually dubbed the obelisk of night (by the players, not me), the only important details to note were the enemies they fought, and the rooms they passed through. Every single creature they fought was something spawned from a mortal body or a mortal soul, everything from ghosts and ghouls, to the more abstract, like golems and oozes. They also found themselves against the odd devil, demon, or daemon (there is a difference, it's all in the A), which proved to be the only genuinely intelligent creatures that weren't undead, insane, tormented nightmares who were only considered intelligent because they had once been sane. The devils, demons, or daemons, rarely spoke to the players, but the few who did were vague in their explanations about the mountain, babbling about an eternal soul splintered into billions, a terrible call and a will that drove even the most soul bound and enslaved of them to ignore their duties and seek out the obelisk. There was also a raid on the campsite at one point by a pair of twins who wanted to get rid of the expeditionary party, but they were killed before they could give their reasons why. The rooms they passed through were a vast storage rooms, labs, graves and weird halls filled with tubes of liquid and glowing balls, they all seemed to be connected, having a purpose of sorts, a single goal.\n\nIt all came to a head at the summit, the final room, a throne room. Sitting upon the chair was a man, there wasn't anything particularly special about him other than the fact that the wizard noted his soul and body weren't exactly whole, nor were they perfectly stitched together like most other living beings. In his deep, ponderous voice, he told them a small story about the beginning of time, before mortals, when there were only personifications of concepts and elements, which slowly developed into the primordial, some of whom became gods. During the first war of the gods, many died, but one god died before all others, a god of life, of free will and creation, slain by asmodeus. In order to ensure this god could never return, his body was sealed away in the centre of the shadow plane, in the heart of the negative energy plane, the source of all undead, the place where all life was snuffed out and could never exist. Placed upon a throne enchanted to prevent all from scrying his bodies location, in a cage built to keep all but he who wielded the key out. The gods soul had been splintered, shattered into billions of pieces, set to eventually reform somewhere else when all the pieces were gathered, unfortunately, a hefty chunk was sealed away within the corpse, and thus those shards bonded to other souls throughout existence, and slowly drew them to achive a single goal. These billions freed the corpse, but could not remove him from the negative energy plane, so they instead constructed a home for him, and a place to study and find a way out of the void.\n\nIn short, the entire mountain was a lab, and a ritual site for one of the greatest acts of magic in history. It was populated by billions of creatures who's souls were all a part of this god, each one having lived a life of their own and as part of him, from the sinful devils, to the wailing ghosts. They were all him, and he was all of them. The reason they had all tried to kill the party, was because they were protecting their progenitor, and no intruders were allowed to enter. He explained this in calm terms before picking up a broken spear, and advancing towards them. They were facing Ihys, brother of asmodeus.\n\nThey tried to convince him to let them go, or to help him even, but he would have none of it. He loved mortals, as he had been the patron of them, but he knew that if he were to return successfully, he could not allow asmodues to learn of him until the time was right, and that mortals, while wonderful, could spell his doom if the dark prince got his hands on their souls. Thus, they were forced to fight Ihys to the bitter end...Bitter for them, as the campaign ended in a TPK. Not because of \"Rocks fall, everyone dies\" meta narrative, but that was simply how the dice rolled that day.\n\nIhys, now free of the negative energy plane, teleported the mountain once again after amassing enough energy, taking himself to some unknown location where he remained, slowly amassing the many fragments of his soul so that he may one day be reborn and rekindle the war between good and evil. (Edit: I forgot to mention that he blew up the planet during the teleport in order to cover his trail.)\n\nI really did feel bad for the group, they got so close to victory, twenty hitpoints away, but they were good sports about it and took it on the chin. We went on to another campaign after that, with a two week break, no where near as epic or over the top, but then again, after fighting one of the first beings to ever exist, wouldn't you want some time to unwind as well?",

        "text": "This took place yesterday, and most likely marks my single best memory of tabletop gaming to date.\n\nContext: We were playing a spelljammer campaign adapted for 5e, when the DM realized the story was going nowhere. So, he dropped us into the Tomb of Annihilation prefab campaign while he wrote up an actual story for space. At this point, our party is deep within the final dungeon. Our party consists of: an immortal mystic (me), a bard, a paladin, an artificer, and a wizard. Not the best comp but there are worse.\n\nIn this particular session, only me, the bard, and the pally made it. Since I've acquired the Ring of Winter, I made a Gibbering Mouther out of ice to join us and be a red shirt. Her name was Gibrene. She had the same stats as her not-ice counterparts, but her magic effects didn't work, so she could only bite.\n\nSo, our story begins when we collect all 10 McGuffins needed to open a puzzle door. Behind the door is a large, circular room, with 9 alcoves in the walls full of treasure. My character, Moroz, recognizes it as a bossfight room, and the party infers the big iron orb floating in the center is the boss, or at least related to it. So, we opt to kill it swiftly and with extreme prejudice.\n\nWe dump our buffs into the pally, since he can do the most targeted damage. Then, I give myself spider climb, teleport to the ceiling above the orb, and switch teleport the pally. It turned out the sphere was magnetic, and would have pulled me off the ceiling if I'd had any non-magical metal on me. But, the pally hits the sphere hard enough that it gets knocked out of its floating position, and the magnetic effect ends. There was much rejoicing.\n\nEnter invisible beholder. His name was something like \"_____ the Unseen\" so we figure out easily that he's invisible. I give myself truesight, and hit it with an ice spike so the party can see where it is. Soon after, I hit it with an attack that covers it in a layer of frost, so now party can properly see it.\n\nInsert boss fight here. Our pally, being melee only, and the beholder being well off the ground, starts looting the treasure alcove. I'm the only ranged dps, and the bard also does his best. We do okay.\n\nThen, our artificer joins the party. He is regurgitated by my gibbering mouther, as she entered the room to try to be distracting and draw fire (which doesn't work). The artificer, the god damn legend, whips out his Wand of Wonder and uses it on the beholder. The wand of wonder has a random effect you need to roll for, and this time it was fireball. Things are looking up.\n\nThe beholder uses disintegrate on the artificer. He is reduced to 0 and dies instantly within a few minutes of joining. The stakes become clear.\n\nOur bard loots the wand of wonder, and uses it on the beholder. butterflies fly out and swarm it, forming a 30-foot cube. All creatures in said cube are effectively blinded. Pretty nifty against a beholder, but now my AoE attacks (most of my attacks) are off the table, because it'd kill the butterflies. So, I move in. Teleport above it, manage to land on it, cut off an eye stalk, fall to the floor. Note: the cloud of butterflies is about 10 feet off the ground, so I can see just fine.\n\nThe beholder eventually does move out of the cloud, moving to the side. Once it's out, it sees two things: Gibrene, below it and to the side, and our paladin.\n\nOur paladin is hit with disintegrate, but lives. But then he is thrown against a wall, and is unconscious. As a result, he auto-fails his save and is petrified. For the better, because death saves can go either way, and we have anti-petrification potions from the time I got petrified myself. Now it is just me and the bard.\n\nThe bard pops his head out from under the cloud and hits the beholder with the wand of wonder again. I do my same maneuver where I teleport above it, but this time I just punch it and roll off back into the cloud, and naturally  falling underneath it. The beholder, in pretty rough shape, now knows we're both down there.\n\nIt floats down to see us, and uses its three attacks. One of them knocks the bard to 0, rendering him unconscious. I resist the other. The final one, though, I fail. It knocks me unconscious.\n\nTotal party kill. Every one of us is unconscious, and open to coup de gras. Our side adventure made to pass in-game time while the story develops in space proved to be too much, and cut our journey short. We lost.\n\nALL BUT ONE.\n\nThe beholder, in his arrogance, made a fatal mistake. He floated into Gibrene's range. Gibrene, the CR2 beast, bites the beholder, and KILLS IT. THE PARTY IS SAVED BY MY SUPPOSEDLY SHITTY ICE MONSTER.\n\nThe bard crits his first death save and wakes up, I wake up after a minute, we unpetrify and heal the pally. The beholder, having been reduced to 0 by a gibbering mouther's bite attack, is absorbed into Gibrene. The only trophy left is the eye stalk I cut off.\n\nSo, ladies and gentleman, let this be a lesson: the Gibbering Mouther is the most powerful enemy in the game. They are to be feared and respected, and never ignored. They may save your life some day, or end it.",

        "text": "A party of selfish murder hobos can accomplish a surprising amount when you dangle a powerful magic item in front of them. It can also be a great way to teach the players about morality and ethics, albeit in a hamfisted kind of way.\n\nThis was one of my earlier games, with one of my earliest groups, the third one specifically. All of them were originally murder hobo style players, a bit rude, kinda demanding on what exactly they wanted and vocal about what they thought they deserved from loot, even if it didn't make sense, basically, a whole group of \"that guy\". Complete with the trope list of edge. A chaotic neutral drow rogue, a human fighter who wore bladed armour and liked to put points into profession torturer, a full blooded orc barbarian retard, and last, but certainly not least, dear, sweet, edgy malutigon, rape\\-born tiefling sourcerer.\n\nAfter a few weeks of DMing these guys i gave up on complex plots and stuff and used them exclusively for combat encounter testing, throwing all kinds of shit at them, because they didn't care what they fought so long as they got EXP and loot. It started off with generic stuff like bandits, goblins and the like, but since they were all kinda evil anyway i used clerics of good gods, and even some angels. They bitched at me for using angels on them, saying they were the good guys and everything, i told them that if they didn't want to fight the angels, they shouldn't begin every interaction with them by throwing a fireball at the biggest one first. Time went on and i really learned a lot about proper combat design, and i still use lessons i learned from that group to this day. But as you might imagine, the group was pretty toxic, and i was about ready to quit on them, but not without bringing a solid conclusion to it all.\n\nThe plot didn't matter, all that did was the magical item the party was hunting, the holy grail, it boosted stats and made the drinker immortal provided that they were deemed worthy, the exact parameters for being deemed \"worthy\" were all outlined in a book they had found, but they burned it after learning about the grail and didn't bother to check the rest of it. They naturally thought that they were worthy, after all, wouldn't any band of murder hobos who had killed an entire town of people in order to find the one guy who screwed them over on a magic item sale?\n\nWith a fresh bag of rations, they set off into the mountains and killed the local giant population on the way to their destination, including the women and children because they thought they'd grow up to be evil. they also considered making more rations out of the giants, but decided against it. They got to the entrance of the dungeon i had prepared, i tried to test them with something else other than strength, posing a riddle to each of them in turn, that only that particular player could hear, and they could not communicate with the others verbally with regards to the riddle. Each one was adjusted with regards to their characters intelligence score, so the barbarian orc was able to get in first because the answer was simple. The rest gave up after ten minutes and started to attack the door, resulting in one big boss fight against a mimic style homebrew beast.\n\nNext trial was one of moral fiber, where in they had to choose what course of action they would take in a certain situation. They could not lie, the trial tester would know if they did. Again, based on one of their stats, wisdom this time, and again, the barbarian actually manages to pass the trial. His situation was simple, he was the chief of a village, it is being raided by a neighbouring tribe, all the houses are on fire. He was asked three questions, what would he do during the raid, what would he do after the raid has passed, and what would he do in the long term. His answers were...in character and surprisingly honest. His answer was to save his people and forgo the material items because a tribe was nothing without its people, followed by gathering what they had left and moving somewhere safe so they could rebuild and get stronger, and in the long term, he'd raid the enemy to punish them for attacking his people. He got a forth question at the end, what would he do with the enemies after capturing them. He said bluntly, \"I'd kill all the men, take in the women, and keep the children under a certain age, they'd help us expand our tribe, and prevent future raids by them.\" He was let through easily enough, while the rest...lied their asses off, trying to be as nice as possible, one of them, malutigon, was put in a situation with a child. I was willing to give leway for all but the stupidest answers, and hers was rather sickly sweet. \"I'd take him to an orphanage after giving him some money and donate to it now and again, i've got more than enough money to give some to it.\" they then rolled for deception, which failed, despite it being a nat 20. Why? a spell called Discern lies, which malutigon failed a will save against. The other two along with her got funneled through a different door, where they were promptly forced into mortal combat against a few golems. I gave the barbarian a PSP with monster hunter on it to occupy him while the others were nearly squashed.\n\nNext trial, they had to do more fighting, but with a twist. They were all healed by the trial guardian before being told that it would be best if they relied on their own strength rather than some inherent boost from outside sources. I didn't explain what that meant, but they kinda figured it had to do with their magic items, the barbarian dropped all of his, same with the rogue, the fighter and sourcerer kept theirs though. I told them to name one thing they had killed in the past that would be \"a good fight\", I did place a good deal of emphasis on the honour of it all, about this ritualistic battle and such. The sourcerer chose a child, one of the many they had killed, and blew them away, the drow chose his own mother (because of course he would) and killed her again, while the fighter and barbarian chose men who had challenged them in the past. The fighter chose an angel he had fought in the past, as he wanted a second shot at him, the angel that appeared wielded magical items of the same power level as his, and the fighter scraped by with one hitpoint. The barbarian on the other hand challenged a giant, one they had fought not that long ago, the hero of his tribe. For the duration of the fight, the barb was affected by the enlarge person spell, and both of them were given axes of powerful magical quality, the barb got to keep his after the fight. Malutigon got bored during all this and attacked the trial guardien when he refused to open the door for them while the barb was fighting...so another boss fight happened that should have killed her and the rogue and the fighter especially, if it weren't for so many fucking crit hits. The barb finished his fight and didn't help them out, the giant ghost guy fading away after he was struck down.  \n\n\nFinal trial, indiana jones style \"find the real grail\". They took all the grails, had one last big fight against that trial guardian, walked out, and then tested them on random people along the road, even though the rogue and barb really didn't think this was a good idea, but no matter which one they tested, the result was the same, nothing. So naturally, they all tried to drink from one cup each, as there had only been 4 to begin with, three of them died instantly, they got saves against it, but they all failed, save for the barb, he got immortality and a plus 6 to his wisdom and constitution. Why? because being worthy of the grail wasn't about being morally or ethically good, it was about being a patient, honourable, honest individual. the grail wasn't testing for goodness, like they had thought, just tested for people of strong, respectable character.  \n\n\nThe barb was probably the least \"that guy\" out of all of them, he was still an ass, but he really did redeem himself in those last few sessions, so much so that it felt only right to let his character get a second chance, after becoming far more like conan the barbarian than anything. The rest of the group? oh they raged, they were pissed, calling me everything under the sun, my last act as their DM was tossing a notebook into the center of the table, telling them to read it while i packed up. it was a list of every horrible thing they had done, granted, the campaign had been a bit light on the moral and ethical punishment up until that point, but it seemed a better way to end it than by letting them all become immortal monsters for all eternity. The barb i did see again in a much later group of mine, guy had improved a lot since then, we had a few fond memories afterwards.",

I bring to you our completely re-edit Victorian Age: Vampire story “Diluted” This was the first time on the channel/podcast that someone else other than I was a storyteller and it was a total blast!\n\nIt is the start of the year 1848.  Kings and Queens hold on absolute power is slipping away.  Mankind is leaving nature behind for the safety and efficiency of coal and steam powered machines in the cramped and diseased cities.  Great machines do the work of dozens in half the time even as they are operated by children.  Science, which can be claimed by any person with a loud enough voice, is bringing brand new medicine to every street corner.  For the ones living in the dark, this means little until one such health tonic proves to have rather unpleasant side effects. \n\nThis is a Vampire: the Masquerade Revised Edition game that is ran from the Victorian Age Vampire expansion and is set in London, England in 1848.

        "text": "The story takes place in the game of Dauntless,which recently entered open beta. I had been playing the game for a few days and I had recently reached the fourth island group.\n\n I had been hunting a particularly nasty behemoth called the Kharbak that had been spotted in the nearby island. As usual me and a team of slayers had been dispatched to take care of the threat. To my surprise my companions this time around were quite friendly and spoke openly instead of the silent, brooding types that usually end up being paired with me. \n\nWe arrived at the floating island and located the behemoth easily. It didn't even try to hide. The battle started of well enough but when it turned invisible one of my companions ran into problems. Unable to find the beast, he couldn't defend himself and go hit by the beast's scythe like claws. Together the rest of us forced it run and managed to save him.\n\nThe hunt was going longer than any of us had expected and we were all nearly out of potions. The beast was moving too fast and our heavy hitter with an axe couldn't land any of his major attacks. Pretty soon the risk of the danger metre getting to 100 had us all on high alert. We prowled through the island and found the beast again. We went in more carefully and pressed it further till it made a mistake.\n\nJumping on top of one of the slayers, the behemoth stuck it's stinger into the ground and called for its swarm. The swarm immediately descended on the poor guy but while it called it up, the behemoth couldn't move. Seeing the opportunity, the axe guy threw caution to the wind and strode right up to the behemoths face. With the full swing of his might, the axe crashed right into its face. With the beast staggered the rest of us gave it our all until finally the beast lay dead at our feet and we went home with a shiny new trophy.",

        "text": "So, TABG was released not a week ago, and I am busy screaming at my PC because I can't get into a game.\n\nAfter uninstalling and reinstalling I get into a game! Hallelujah!\n\nI land in Mountain Town or somewhere, and begin frantically searching the place for weaponry. (The circle in this game is lit)\n\nI find an uzi, with ammo, and a ballistics shield. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of playing this game, or haven't experimented in the shooting range, the ballistics shield is full frontal protection, a black rectangle that covers your entire body, with a window in the front for you to look out of.\n\nIm stoked, I have almost perfect protection, and a way to respond when they run out of ammo. So I keep searching, until I turn a corner, and I'm also reduced to game over by some guy with a smg. Pulling out the shield, with less than 10&amp;#37; health, the guy looks like your scrapyard spec\\-ops, kitted out with grenades, side arms, and armour already and it's only like three mins in.\n\nAnd apparently, he has all the ammo, because he unloaded his entire stock of ammo in his primary weapon slot, because he soon switches to a pistol. Even though it was just a game, and he was two googly eyes peeking out of helmet, I could just sense the frustration. He didn't know what to do.\n\nAnd that's when I remember that I can shield bash. So I walk up to the guy, who is waiting for me to slip up and put away the shield, and SLAM him. He starts frantically shooting me again, and I chase him, constantly throwing myself at him, and beating him with my shield. He has no idea what to do, and eventually just throws himself over the edge of the platform we're on, and lands on a house roof, which is level with the platform.\n\nNow the true stalemate begins. I can't leave or jump over, because then my floppy ragdoll body would allow him to blast me while I right myself. So we just stare at each other, unyielding, unwilling. And I can see in his in game character, he is completely confused.\n\nWhat should be an easy kill, has turned out to be an unstoppable juggernaut of vengeance. We stand there, even as the shadows of the circle's monoliths close in. We watch each other like hawks, even as gun shots ring out in the distance.\n\nThen bullets rain down upon him, and I take a millisecond to look up at the figure standing on the roof, who hasn't seen me because I'm standing in the doorway of a house.\n\nHe runs, as do I.\n\nI run, as fast as I can towards the safezone, trying to out run the timer, and somehow, I slip through the gap between the closing walls. I run a little forwards, and take some time to organise myself.\n\nI turn backwards, to see the epic sight of the doors closing, except...\n\nHe's back. And this time, my shield isn't up.",

Four years ago London was flooded, possibly by climate change. Now it's become something of a cyber-Venice, with boats and hovercars plying the watery streets and makeshift bridges strung between high-rises. The flooded area, extending about five miles either side of the Thames, is now known as Old London. It's considered undesirable for new development, with corporations preferring to build their arcologies among the shining spires of New London in the dry areas. Where there's disaster there's opportunity, though; smugglers and scavengers use submarines to dredge the depths and stay out of sight, and some corporations focus on humanitarian efforts to keep up a good public image.\n\nHere's a summary of the first mission.\n\n**Mission 1: Operation STOCKHOLM SYNDROME**\n \nStarring:\n \n**Admiral**, a possibly mad old man with a well-armed military sub. He believes that Queen Elizabeth II is still alive and in the custody of Disney Hypermedia after he saw an actress playing her in a film.\n \n**Amets Estibariz**, a cyber-artist who believes virtual reality is just as valid as the physical world.\n \n**Freyja**, a crime boss's estranged daughter with neon blue hair, a gang of mafia goons and connections with everyone worth knowing.\n \nThe operatives were contacted by a Mr Patel, who met them in a pub in the Anchorage, a floating shopping district with an unsavoury reputation. He tasked them with abducting Kristina Olssen, an executive for GlaxoZeneca Biotech, who would be flying into town from Sweden in a few days for an overnight stay.\n \nBack at the hideout, a plush study with fake wood-panelled walls and bookcases, Freyja contacted her Cousin Jimmy, a distant relative who she hadn't spoken to in some time, for intel. He found Kristina's schedule for the trip, but asked for a favour at a later date. He may also have tipped someone off about her activities. After examining the schedule, the team decided to strike while Kristina is en-route to the party.\n \nFreyja called up Charlotte Williams, a former soldier who had all her limbs replaced with cybernetics after a serious injury, to get some non-lethal weapons (tranquiliser darts and tear gas). She agreed, but asked for a favour with securing some more supplies later.\n \nAfter Admiral had researched the route to find a suitably out-of-the-way side street to kidnap Kristina Olssen, Amets went to check it out. Idling in their car, they noticed a sniper's nest set up with a tripod and binoculars in a building under construction nearby.\n \nAdmiral, meanwhile, scouted out the escape route in his submarine, the Queen Elizabeth's Revenge. An archway underwater provided a perfect place to submerge and get away from any surface vehicles in the flooded street. He also noticed a Darkhov security camera underwater, which silently watched him and did nothing.\n \nWhen the time came for the mission, the team decided to split up, with Admiral, Amets and two of Freyja's gang members (Sinclair and Jones) in the sub underwater while Freyja and her bodyguard/father-figure Old Man Wick secured the area from an abandoned hotel.\n \nAdmiral sent his octo-bot drone out to scout underwater and found a shark drone armed with torpedoes patrolling the depths of the flooded street, its floodlights flickering about for smuggler threats. The octo-bot was stealthy enough to avoid notice for now.\n \nFreyja managed to hack into the GlaxoZeneca team's secure comms frequency and heard them approaching. She sent some of her backup gangsters to lay down suppressing fire on the sniper's nest if the sniper showed their face.\n\nKristina arrived on a speedboat with three goons, one of whom was driving. Old Man Wick threw down some tear gas grenades on Freyja's orders, but missed the boat and instead gassed some civilians walking past. The security goons opened fire on the hotel and managed to hit Freyja in the arm. While she was distracted by being shot, the sniper revealed himself and shot her with a tranquiliser dart. The gangsters shot back at the sniper and wounded him, but he managed to escape.\n \nAmets popped out of the hatch on top of the submarine and shouted for the security guards to surrender on pain of being ventilated with autogun fire. They refused and shot back, and they were promptly ventilated with autogun fire by Admiral. With some careful shooting he avoided hitting Kristina, and Sinclair and Jones tied her up and dragged her onto the sub.\n \nHowever, one of the goons managed to call for backup when the tear gas hit, and the shark drone brought its torpedoes to bear on the submarine. Admiral sent the octo-bot to try and wrestle it away, and successfully managed to divert the first torpedo shot into a building. That gave him enough time to bring the autocannon to bear and blow the shark-bot out of the water.\n \nFreyja, feeling woozy from the tranquilisers and the gunshot wound, was carried out of the hotel room by Wick and back to the car parked on a nearby street. Admiral, meanwhile, stuck his head out of the hatch and indulged his mad desire for fame by shouting for everyone who cared to listen that Admiral Jack Cromwell was responsible for the attack.\n\nThe operatives avoided any further pursuit and returned to the hideout. Dr Nakamura, a former paramedic in Freyja's gang, treated her gunshot wound and then the team interrogated Kristina. Under duress she eventually revealed that the Darkhov family was looking for intel on GlaxoZeneca's higher-level operations. She also suggested that the team ransom her back to GlaxoZeneca instead of handing her over. At that point, Freyja heard some comms chatter from the channel she'd hacked into earlier: “Distress call received. We're converging on your position now, ma'am.” Kristina was keeping them talking to buy some time for GlaxoZeneca security to attack.\n \nRansoming her was out of the question now – the team agreed that they would get the hell out of the hideout and deliver her to their employer as planned, and Freyja ordered her men to remove everything of value from the warehouse. She also drank a few glasses of expensive whiskey – her one vice - to steady herself.\n \nThe gang drove off in their black jeeps while the PCs and Freyja's personal guards left in the submarine. Amets called Mr Patel and got the location for the dropoff while Freyja had a nap. Before long, the intercepted GlaxoZeneca frequency lit up again: “Target in sight.” A speedboat with a mounted machine gun was homing in on Kristina's implanted tracker to follow the submarine across the Thames, and catching up quickly. Admiral had to act quickly. He brought the submarine around and launched the octo-bot to slip underneath the boat and sabotage the engine. It cut the fuel lines with its pincers and left the security forces on the boat stranded while the sub slipped away.\n \nThey didn't have much time before more security arrived, so the team proceeded directly to the dropoff location – a dockside warehouse with a pair of conspicuous security guards outside. Freyja and Amets entered with Wick, Sinclair, Jones and the prisoner. Mr Patel opened his briefcase to reveal the cash payment, as promised. As he leaned over, his collar slipped down and revealed the tattoo of a Darkhov lieutenant – he worked directly for Freyja's estranged father, the head of the Darkhov family.\n \nIt was at that moment that Freyja knew she had to kill him. Subvocalising, she told the rest of the crew that it was an ambush and drew her laser pistol. Mr Patel reacted in time to grab her arm and throw the shot off into the floor, then all hell broke loose.\n \nAmets dived for cover. Freyja's gang laid down suppressing fire. Admiral fired the autocannon on the submarine, killing the security guards nearest the window instantly. Mr Patel drew his own concealed pistol, shooting Freyja in the stomach, and got shot in the head by Old Man Wick for his trouble.\n \nFreyja snatched the briefcase of cash and dived for cover. Kristina was cowering on the floor at the sound of gunfire, still blindfolded and restrained. One of the security guards called for reinforcements, and the team realised they had to get out of there now. Admiral laid down some covering fire, trying to get everyone out alive, but a stray burst made its way towards Freyja and Old Man Wick took the hit for her. Freyja dragged his body to the submarine as Amets and the other gang members led the way. They made it out alive, but at a terrible cost.",

After thinking about how this was a McGuffin to end an incurable plague, he correctly guessed that this staff belonged to The Grim Reaper.\n\n\nThe party's wizard, a necromancer, immediately glomed on to the staff, and beheld Death incarnate. A Titanic being from before The Gods, who holds the ultimate sway over those who will die.\n\nThe Reaper demands to know where the necromancer is, and why he was holding The Scythe, which was broken and lost tens of thousands of years ago.\n\nThe necromancer capitulates completely, and even gives the location of the room they are in within Abbadon's palace.\n\nBy the time the necromancer breaks out of his vision, the party is being tied up by Abbadon's pit fiends. Before he is gagged, the necromancer reassures everyone that reinforcements are on the way.\n\nWithin a few minutes, a chill wind fills the room and The Reaper gallops in on his customary pale horse. The Reaper puts an immediate halt to everything going on, and demands his staff.\n\nThrough conversation, the players discover that the \"Great, black blade\" that the barbarian looted from a temple in The Shadowfell was actually the blade of The Scythe.\n\n\nThe players begin to hastily bargain with The Reaper, and agree to surrender their piece of The Scythe. And, in exchange, The Reaper would...\n\n\n1) **Immediately** reap Abaddon's soul.\n\n2) Recall the magical plague.\n\n3) Return the players to their home.\n\nDeath agrees, as he had been trying to restore his scythe since Pelor, Asmodeus, Bahamut, Corellon (and a few others) stole it from him several millenia ago.\n\n\nThe mechanical consequences of these actions included...\n\n1) For the first time in tens of thousands of years, The Reaper may claim the souls of big-G Gods... (And they got *pissed* about that.)\n\n2) Nobody can get resurrected by anyone, ever. This caused a pretty big societal shakeup, as The Gods were apparently no longer more powerful than death.\n\n3) Indirectly, this would later get Corellon Larethian killed off for real in my setting, as he didn't know he was mortal when he went out to fight the evil demigod-Emperor Rex.",

        "text": "When a character dies, there are usually a few reliable reactions you might expect from the player, one of them, is the revenge character. A character built purposefully to cause a wrinkle, be it to break the game and piss everyone off, or to fuck specifically with what the DM just did to kill their character.\n\nWe were running through a gothic themed campaign, mainly because I wanted to use a bunch of classic monsters, and my players were just really in the mood to be a bunch of monster hunters in a grim dark world. The whole thing took place in a setting i cobbled together over a few sleepless nights, filled with huge mountain ranges, gothic cities, awful weather and thick pine forests.\n\nThe party had just finished killing a vampire that had somehow managed to get into the city, steaking it as it slept during the day. Naturally, they were entitled to some compensation, which was distributed by the local head of law enforcement, who handed them a letter, an invitation to a party that very evening, hosted by count Cirksena, an eccentric who had been instrumental in killing an infestation of were\\-rats some years back. The party went to the event, dressed in fine attire, still carrying their weaponry, as was custom. They wined and dined, slowly splitting apart from each other, with samuel, a half orc gunslinger, spending his time with a lonely wallflower. The head of the group, a homebrew modified inquisitor, met with the count, their time together was informative, as he pointed out a few things that only the nobility knew about that had been kept secret, like rumours of a vampire brood spreading through the cities upper ranks.\n\nAfter a while, the party began to wind down and everyone started to meet back up, ready to head home...except samuel. No one knew where he went, not even his player, that was until i sent him a few pictures, pictures of dice rolls, with text underneath detailing what each one was for. They were will saves, will saves for samuel. He had failed to resist being dominated by that wallflower women, and was now missing. All they found after declaring an investigation was that the women he had been with was never invited, and that all they could find of samuel was his weaponry left on a bench beside a balcony.\n\nI did warn them that if the situation was appropriate, I'd make saving throws for them to keep the scene going and to not alert them OOC. I do this all the time with perception rolls to. He knew the risks, and he had just lost his character for going out onto a balcony alone at night with a pale, red eyed women he had only just met who said she found the light inside to be a bit too bright for her tastes.\n\nHis reaction, make something that would never be vampire bait ever again. Next week, he showed up to the table with what at first looked like a simple warforged monk, but as they were pushing to level 10 at this point, everyone wondered why he had so few magic items. Regardless, I introduced him to the rest of the party as their replacement for samuel, sent by Cirksena, they all hit it off rather well and continued on.  \n\n\nTheir new goal was to kill the vampire that had taken samuel, and hopefully save him, but because they had so few leads, they were forced to enact an old inquisition ritual...barge in without warning and accuse everyone until they found the criminal. This was done to two noble houses who had been fingered by Cirksena the previous night, and sure enough, one of them turned out to be the location of a nightcrawler. Combat against vampires was never easy, i buffed them up quite a bit to make them real threats, but only with small numbers of vampires, if i ever used many, i just used the normal template.\n\nHowever, this one went down very easily, because their warforged friend, proceeded to pull his hand off, and fire a cannonball made entirely of silver at the beast, pulping it with a brutal critical for 4X the damage. He had used the money normally spent on magical items, to pimp his warforged, he was made out of a silver alloy, had two cannons in his arms, could breath fire, equipped with retractable silver spikes he could snap off and shank people with, and lastly, a water pistol that was loaded with holy water which squirted from his eyeball. \n\nWith this new death machine, they were able to push down into the basement, where they found samuel, along with some other basic vampire thralls. Despite the fact the player really loved samuel, he had the warforged focus fire on him and killed his old guy, who could have been saved. When i asked why after the session, he simply replied with \"because (character name, i forget what) is going to be a hell of a lot more annoying for you to bring down.\"",

        "text": "[Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/) is a web-serial that has a realistic take on superheroes and subverts many of the common tropes of classic and modern movies and comics. Within Earth Bet, there are twelve power classifications, but today we will solely be focusing on a Tinker, a mad scientist style power where the user can create and use technology beyond the realm of modern science that sadly they themselves don't fully understand. Most Tinkers have a specialty that they can work within, say cybernetics, propulsion, or gravity based gear, and the further they try and stray outside of their field the harder it is to make and the less likely it is to work once they complete it. \n\nWarning: it does get a little dark, so you may want to stop if you're particularly squeamish, but if that is the case then I'm very curious as to why you opened this post.\n\nMy character, Wildcard, has a neat little quirk to her specialty. Every time she tries to use her power to build, blueprint, or repair, she has a chance to have her specialty change, either a minor shift (say pyrotechnical devices to explosives only) or a major shift (gravity to light). \n\nMost Tinkers run into a problem pretty quickly, if they want to build better gear, they need parts, parts cost money, and sadly not everyone is Tony Stark/Bill Gates. Even with a largely expanded budget left by her late husband, Wildcard quickly ate through her funds creating a super-laptop, a gravity based jet-pack/harness, a generator that created energy based off of the gravity of the earth, and a super-soldier serum roast chicken to give her all the gains (and certainly didn't nearly kill her). With a nearly empty bank account and a thirst for something in the realm of justice she signed up at the government sanctioned superhero team, known as the Protectorate. \n\nShortly after joining the Protectorate she found another quirk to her power, she had almost no ability to stop herself from building whatever came to mind, regardless of it's cost. Over her month-long stay as a member of the Brockton Bay Protectorate, she built a ninja robot butler with nearly full artificial intelligence, a cuthulu-dog, a replicator that can only make full scale Space Marine Bolters (think a gun about as big as a person, that fires slugs the size of your head), an oddly phallic baseball bat (that certainly had no connection to Saint's Row), the most relaxing music in the world, super coffee that certainly won't have any long term negative effects, a kinetic energy negation mine, clothes that mind control the wearer, and most importantly, the worlds most powerful blender. \n\nBy this point the director was furious, both at Wildcard's hard-line attitude and her horrendous budgeting costs, she was \"traded\" to the Gary Indiana Protectorate team (in other words, the middle of nowhere) in the hopes that she would be less trouble for the Protectorate out there, away from the action. Sadly, it was not to be. She gained the specialty of goop, and asked herself if she could create a healing goop. Her power said yes, and she was puppeted away into a manic Tinker frenzy. There's one other thing you should know about the Protectorate and Tinkers. The Protectorate is pretty used to getting crazy requests and fulfilling them, as generally the less reasonable the request, the better the end product (at least according to our interpretations on the Tinkers guide and resource based Tinkers). The Protectorate had already given her everything from corpses (that poor cuthulu dog) to radioactive materials (I forget how many things used this) to special silk (those mind control clothes). So, when the new Tinker rushes down to the requisitions office demanding any source of stem cells, they get right on it, especially since her power is known to wane and shift spontaneously, if she doesn't get the materials in time, funds already allocated will be lost, and the end product could easily need to be scrapped. \n\nIn Dark Heresy (and all Warhammer 40k TPRG's) you roll on a D100 for ability checks and for things like event rolls, with 1 being critical success and 100 being critical failure. My wonderful DM rolled twice. Once, to check if they could acquire a sufficient number of stem cells, and a second time for *how* they would acquire them. The first check was a critical success and they miraculously found several pounds of stem cells in the short time that Wildcard needed them. The second check was a critical failure. He decided, that how they got them and how I would process them would have to be a public relations *nightmare* since that would mean I still passed the first check, but still wouldn't be happy with the outcome. \n\nWell, it turns out that there is an abortion clinic right down the street from the Protectorate building, and they've just had an unusually large influx of customers recently. The clinic decided they didn't want to ask any questions to the government facility asking them for fetuses, and some idiot at the requisitions office didn't see a single flaw in asking for them. Thus, Wildcard was delivered a tub full of unborn children. \n\nSadly, our tale doesn't end here. Remember that Tinker frenzy? Well that resulted in her not questioning this long train of questionable decisions either. Remember that super blender? Well it turns out that was the only way to properly begin extracting the stem cells. Then, Wildcard was found in her lab by one of her new co-workers (their first meeting, I'll add) furiously blending her way through a tub of unborn children. \n\nThey exclaimed \"What are you doing? This must be a war crime or something!\" \n\nTo which she replied \"Geez, calling it a war crime just makes it sound bad.\" \n\nI'll have you know that the healing goop worked perfectly fine. \n\nThis incedent also lead to our resident artist drawing [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/167845780286210058/453458690922643466/Complete.png)\n\nIf that link isn't OK here or isn't working then I'll have to upload it to Imgur, but if this works then I'll keep using it that way. \n\nEdit: Fixed words.",

        "text": "intelligent items are a treat for me, the players love them, I love them, and they always end in total misery for whoever wields it. While I have plenty of fun stories about intelligent items, few caused as much chaos as Willie.\n\nWillie was a chaos mage who ascended to the 20th level, who then tried to become immortal in some capacity by sealing his mind away inside a very delicately crafted body of metal. But when his magic fluctuated, his mind was sealed within everything but the body, this includes the dozens of magical items in his tower, some furniture and other fun stuff. Without the master of the tower to re\\-do the enchantments that kept it safe inside the maelstrom, the tower was teleport stormed into oblivion, scattering pieces of the mage to every place imaginable. This was the backstory of my line of \"Willie's magical items\" which i introduced in almost every campaign i ran. \n\nAfter a sordid job dealing with animated cum underneath a brothel, the players got their payment, and a little extra in the form of a phalic stick covered in gemstones, they almost sold it at first, but they decided to see if it had any useful applications and tried to use it. Unfortunately for them, I had failed to inform them that the rod of wonder was using a customized table I had designed personally. It had 1000 effects, and they rolled the result that fired a giant 5ft by 5ft cube of caramel pudding thirty feet and acted as a single space 'web spell', unfortunately, they had just smothered the parties halfling, who started to choke on it. After it's first use, the rod began to speak to all of them, imagine rick flare, but with a quiver in his voice and he is suffering from the most awkward erection possible.\"Woooooooooh! That's a load off my mind, thanks for giving me a stroke out, I feel so much better. Who gave me a hand? Well, come on, rise up and fire off.\" \n\nThey all gave me this look, but considering the job they had just finished, they weren't really surprised. One of them, the parties bard, decided to 'bond' with it and keep it safe in case they ever wanted to get crazy or he was out of logical options, a wise choice, considering that the table i had was loaded with results that were just disgustingly overpowered, or dangerous to the wielder.\n\nWhile Willie was never whipped out that often, the first few times had them in awe of his lethal discharges, and hesitant to unleash his might without caution. The reason for their fear and respect of Willie was born from a simple encounter against the local murder cult who the thieves guild had been having trouble with, thus leading to a pay out for whoever brought them the leaders head. They got to the main chamber of the cultists compound, which was pretty much an entire warehouse turned into a shrine for their dark god. The bard was out of spells, out of crossbow bolts, and out of anything to really protect himself, so in desperation, he undid his trousers, and pulled out Willie, firing him off at the robed figure who was going to kill him...The result was \"Fill the entire room with mashmellows, every creature that needs to breath must make checks against suffocating, and their movement is reduced by half, the marshmellow is rendered inert and is considered none\\-magical and cannot be dispelled.\" They filled up a 60ft by 80ft warehouse with this white sticky stuff, killing off about thirty cultists who had formed a circle around the party, the leader, and almost killing the entire party.\n\nAfter that, they collected their money and needed a \"break\", so we played shopping, so they could get new gear, look around the town with little issue and have one of those \"chill sessions\". This did not last long. While at their room in the tavern, the bard decided to give Willie a tug, just to see what else he might do, one roll later, and the opposite wall had been turned into a thick slab of copper. As this was a ramshackle wooden tavern, the wall then proceeded to break the one below it with it's weight, and it nearly collapsed the entire tavern, the only thing keeping it from being entirely destroyed was the goliath barkeeper. They were promptly kicked out of the cheapest place in the city and were stuck with a ten foot tall copper wall for their troubles. Being smart, they sold it to a blacksmith for a mint and used the money to buy an old abandoned building which cost twice as much as the initial fee to repair to a decent standard.\n\nIn full view of everyone else, the bard took Willie out again one day while they were looking for work, and gave it a shot for the lols. I can't remember the result, but it was somewhere within the bottom 5&amp;#37; of results, I first thought it was the joke result i had on there of a god being summoned naked, blind and strangely aroused for one round before being sent back to wherever they were previously, but it was so much better than that. \"The caster summons their parents to them for one minute, after which they forget the caster ever existed for two weeks and assumes they are some jealous ex lover of the other parent.\" This was especially fun, because the bard had been searching for his mother for most of his life. There she was, an elven queen dressed in pure sapphire blue with messy bed hair and a wooden bowl of fresh water, standing next to his father, the old charming barkeeper who had raised him. He had exactly one minute to talk to her, to make her understand who he was and why he was so happy to see her, and when she started to tear up upon realizing this was the baby boy she had to abandon, poof. They vanished again and he fell flat on his face after trying to hug the air. The real kicker of that was no one had bothered to ask which elven nation she ruled over, or how to get there.\n\nFor a little context, the city this campaign took place in was like dunwall from dishonoured, a massive, sprawling, partly abandoned semi steampunk place. Beyond border mountains that circled the nation from coast to coast, was the sprawling continent of edrwiess, a mass of elven kingdoms all warring for control of the world tree and the favour of their elven gods. So now the entire campaign, which had been about trying to survive in this shithole of a town and to achieve, well, something, suddenly became a trek through the elven kingdoms in search of the bards mother.\n\nThe actual trip was delayed by a week because they needed the gold to get protection for their home, and for various supplies, they also wanted to teleport as close as possible to whichever nation the queen might be, so they needed money for that. So, they tried stroking willie a few times in the hopes that one of his magical loads would shower them with gold. They burned all three charges, with each result being worse than the last. The first was simply make everything in a 30ft cone in front of the caster turn pink, followed by swapping the gender of everything within a 30ft cone for ten minutes, and lastly, small imps spawn on the shoulder of 1d6 creatures within 50ft of the caster (including the caster) who whisper terrible ideas into their ear, these imps are incorporeal and cannot be killed, they disappear after a minute.\n\nIncredibly confused, they decided to rely on other methods of gold collection, swearing not to use Willie unless there was no other course of action, or if they just got really bored. Some time passed and they got everything they needed by doing a bunch of rapid fire jobs, even ensuring the protection of their home with the aid of the local thieves guild who had grown very fond of them. With that all said and done, they bought passage to the only elven kingdom they thought was the home of the bards mother, after discussing it with the wizard who warped them there. \n\nThrough some diplomacy bullshit, they were able to get a meeting with the queen in the royal throne room, dressing themselves up with the use of prestidigitation and minor creation before entering into her presence...whereupon she immediately tried to throw them all in jail because she thought the bard, who was actually her son, was some asshole here to kill her for fucking a now long retired bard. It broke out into an all out brawl, simply because the barbarian refused to be put in chains again. They were about level 13 or so at the time, and the barbarian had taken levels in the prestige class berserker, this meant he got massive, disgustingly huge bonuses to strength and constitution, among other things, but would always attack the closest creature to himself if he triggered berserker rage, as opposed to normal rage. So mid fight, after killing two guards, he lept at the queen, and the bard had to unleash willie. The result? A puff of awful smelling gas that fills a ten by ten foot cube. She was so nearly sliced in half, i remember wincing as i marked down how little HP she had left.\n\nThe fight stopped being about escaping and quickly became making the barbarian calm down, which they managed to pull off by having the parties fighter bullrush him in the direction of some elven soldiers so he'd hack at them instead. In the end they realized they needed to cast dispel magic on her to get her to remember him sooner, did so, and things slowly winded down as everyone dogpiled on the barb until his berserker rage ran out. The very next level he got, everyone forced him to take something that allowed him to pre\\-maturely end his berserker rage at any time.\n\nTo skip over some mushy stuff, the bard left the party to be with his mother and learn about how he came to be and what his life might entail, while the rest of the party were pardoned for their crimes and graciously told to fuck off. Only after the party was beyond the borders did they realize the bard still had willie, but it had been made pretty clear they'd be killed on sight if they tried to go back.  \n\n\nThus ends the tale of willie the rod of wonder, well, that incarnation at least. He really was a blast to use.",

        "text": "This is a story from what happened when I played the sims 4\n\nOk, so heads up this one isn't going to reflect well on my mental stability, so obviously disclaimer I know and would never do any of these things which are dreadful. I know that goes without saying most of the time but with this one, well.... buckle up.\n\nSo it all started with one sim, Steven Guy, a black hair handsome man with evil traits, charisma and a romantic side. I bought a house with one bedroom and after upgrading the electrical's and plumbing I went out into the world to meet some people. (Seriously, this is where it get weird). I walked up and met the sim Eliza and Bob Pancakes, instantly and repetitively, befriended her and moved both of them into the small house selling all their goods and making a profit. Now dear reader, one may assume why in such a small house with only about 50,000 simoleons I would invite a married couple in well this is where the true evil begins.\n\nControlling Eliza I made her divorce her husband and get with Steven, more over and worse than that I made Bob into a gimp wearing short shorts, a jumper and a blue wrestling mask and made him clean a lot. Not only that though because this was when I began to build a basement....\n\nThe basement was made up of five rooms, two four by seven bedrooms with a fridge and toilet, an empty but locked off room with no lights, a large open entertainment room with two computers and televisions, and finally a locked off and dark swimming pool. I then put Eliza down in basement, dressed in a Leia robe (I was starting a cult long story... it gets worse) and got out again to try and find more people...\n\nThis was when Steven met Raven Goodman and her teenage son Rodrigo, two neighbors who were also assimilated into this house of horrors with more sold off possessions, Raven joined the basement cult but Rodrigo was had a worse fate as Bob was the gimp Rodrigo was locked in a small 1 by 1 bricked off room and slowly and painfully starved to death. At this point Steven then made a baby with Eliza and immediately once she gave birth she was locked in basement never to see her child, Dorian Guy, who also immediately was aged into a child because babies are a hassle (I also made the house bigger to have a very big bedroom)\n\nBack with Bob, his use as a gimp was no longer needed and he was sacrificed into the underground pool, \\[Steven laughed a his graving in the growing graveyard outside the house\\]. Following on from this Steven made the most significant choice of all of this, he fell in actual love with Raven \\[I hit the wrong option\\] and the two made another child Stephany (yes the spelling was what auto generated) who was immediately aged into an young adult along with Dorian and they both moved out of the house into a secondary house together which i'll get into later.\n\nNow Steven, content with Raven but lumbered with Eliza he did what he saw best and aged Eliza into an elder using the cake and woo\\-hoo'd to the point that she died of over exertion joining her first husband in the graveyard. This left Steven in a predicament, he needed to kill again. Thus he went out and did the same routine with a family Katrina (Adult and mother of the family), Dina (Daughter and Married to Don) and Nina Caliente (Young adult) and Don Lothario. Don became the gimp for a bit but was killed off so fast that he's not important, another grave more laughing.\n\nAt this point as a way of generating revenue Raven had begun painting and had gotten to skill level 10 making masterpiece after masterpiece, she began to tutor the now part of a cult Nina with the intent of replacing her eventually. Katrina was a woo\\-hoo once and then killed in the empty dark room in the basement which I used to starve her to death, Nina and Steven eventually got together and made a kid, Emerson, who per schedule was aged up and moved in with his half brother and sister (I swear there's something about all three but I'll go into it later). Nina died like her brother and sister Dina (forgot about her but she was drowned, story too long doesn't matter).\n\nHowever at this point in the story the children of Steven Guy are now important to the story, I had put them up in a small house for the three of them to live in, Stephany became a secret agent, Dorian became a criminal and Emerson became scientist. Emerson however is unique as he's the only one of the children without the evil trait instead he was the good son. Him and Steven had a fight about good and evil and they parted on bad terms.\n\nSteven was sad and would've confided in Raven his one true love, if not for the fact that she had died before any of the Caliente women. It was at this point the supernatural gets involved, Steven wakes up befriends and loves the ghost of Raven moving her into the house and making her a permanent member of the living world again, at this point in utter happiness Steven renounces the basement blocking it off and turning everything off for good. Raven's ghost makes an effort to connect with the daughter she never met and the two became best friends.\n\nSteven however remained aloof from his children, only talking to them once in his life... at his wedding to Ravens ghost and they were happy together for three days until... Steven died in a small locked room starving to death. Raven was on her own for about three or four days until he returned as a ghost and Raven moved him in, they were happy together and the two visited their children and had dinner, Steven became more compassionate in death more than he ever did in life.\n\nAnd that's all that happened at this point, I think that's a good place to end Steven's story as he went from serial killer to lover to dead to born again and trying to make amends. Obviously as a side note real life domestic abuse is bad and after reading all this I may seem a bit unhinged but again, obviously, I'm sane and realise how horrific this story really is. As for what comes next, I may do an update about the children so, yeah... Sorry this is really long.",

        "text": "I was GMing a tabletop roleplaying game, set in a world of low fantasy. Basically, there's a big dark forest with ancient ruins and people like to go snoop around and steal artifacts from the ruins, but there are a lot of curses and dark forces going on in these woods.\n\nThe characters were : a greedy wizard from a guild of scholars, his flaming servant (in the fire sense of the word) created with magic, and a guide, sorta like a hobo hunter, who was supposed to lead them to a ruin he had found.\n\nSo I told the premise of the adventure : the Guide had discovered a ruin and proposed to the guild of wizards to sell them the info. The wizards had refused, suspicious. The Wizard PC had overheard the conversation, and, being greedy and ambitious, had contacted the Guide to propose a substantial reward if he was to lead him to the ruin.\n\nI let the players plan the expedition almost by themselves : looking up the ruins in a library to see if it was interesting (there was a legend about an ancient guild of magicians who had stacked their treasures there), recruiting carriers and mercenaries NPCs, and negotiating their price, buying the supplies, etc.\n\nThe expedition goes in the forest, secretly. They're spotted by a guard (or rather, they say hello to him without taking precautions), who will probably tell on them to the guild. No turning back now.\n\nThe expedition takes its course : the mercenaries complain a little too much (the characters had been a little sloppy on the job interviews).\n\nFast forward to : the expedition comes out of the ruins with a big treasure. The Servant of the Wizard has been victim of a magic trap and is now blind ; one of the mercenaries is wounded and the others are tired and scared and want to go home. That's when the Guide (yes, the PC who is the guide of the expedition) realizes that he doesn't have to complete his mission, for a miserable salary, and decides instead to cut the Wizard's throat in his sleep and walk away with the treasures they have found. They're in the middle of a forest, the Wizard's Servant is blind, he has all the cards. One of the mercenaries, let's call him Bob, is completely down with it, the other NPCs, not so much, but they'll participate nonetheless.\n\nThat's where it gets really interesting : they completely mess up their mutiny. The Wizard, alerted of their ill intentions (because of the lack of discretion of the Guide), runs away with part of the treasure, leaving most of the goods in the camp and a wall of fire on his trail to stop pursuers ; the Guide decides to jump across the wall and begins burning ; he chases the Wizard, while screaming and burning alive, and the Wizard eventually runs away.\n\nBack to the camp, the other mutinees are trying to fight the blind Servant, who is doing surprisingly well, thanks to his big armor. He kills one, the other, Bob, goes after the Wizard ; he finds the Guide sat on the forest floor, looking like a burnt tandoori chicken leg.\n\nWhen Bob and the Guide return to the camp, they find that the rest of the mercenaries have fled, with everything that the Wizard had not taken with him in his own flight. The Servant is alone, without a master, blind, in the middle of an abandoned camp.\n\nAFTERMATH :\n\n* The Wizard, who wanted to come home glorious, with treasures of knowledge, will come home to his guild, alone, with only a fraction of the treasure (if he ever finds his way back to civilization). His career is ruined, no one will ever take him seriously, he will never be a professor in the Queen's university, or even a read author, or even a respected custodian in the entry hall of the guild.\n* The Guide, who wanted to be rich, has now nothing left, and is severely burnt ; no one will ever accept to work with him again. Plus, he's with Bob, who turns out to be a bandit who was supposed to alert his friend on the way back so they could steal the expedition. Bob proposes the Guide to join his band, which, at this point, is probably the best chance the Guide has to survive. Plus, Bob, who had kept to himself until then, turns out to be really obnoxious.\n* The blind Servant still waits for his master to return.\n* The only winners of the story are the three NPCs (the medic, the wounded mercenary and a big dumb and sweet ogress carrier) who took the loot and ran away while the Guide and Bob were after the Wizard. I like to think they lost it all in gambling, or in another vice, or killed each other over the partition.",

        "text": "Character deaths are one thing, but it really hurts to have a character broken, crippled to the point of useless, be it physically or mentally. As was the case with one of my players monk characters.\n\nWe were experimenting with variant critical hit lists and effects at the time, so instead of extra damage, things like dismemberment, bleeding, or something fun like that would happen. This turned out to be a really great alternative, as it meant that a swarm of smaller enemies couldn't just randomly bring down a hero with a lucky crit, and bigger monsters were just that much tougher, but there was still some benefit to the crit in other ways.  \n\n\nThe party were hunting down the undead sea captain of a large man'o war which had sunk some years back, and now he and his crew were attacking the coast. They tracked them down to an off shore island that had at one time belonged to a dragon. Killing their way past the scallywags, one wight at a time, they eventually got to the final fight against the captain, his first mate, the quartermaster, the main cannon hand and the doctor. They split off into one on one fights, with the monk taking on the quartermaster, a four armed skeleton who wielded two pistols and two swords. Everything was going well until the quartermaster rolled critical on his keen sabers, two crits in one go. At the time we chose the effect instead of rolling, since we treated crits as a \"spotted an opening\" kind of thing, rather than a lucky strike. Two dismemberment effects seemed like the most fun at the time, which boiled down to the loss of two limbs, and additional bleed damage for a few turns.  \n\n\nThe monk, had been disarmed, both arms falling into the briny water below, nearly dying from the shock and blood loss. In his last moments of consciousness, he grappled the pirate with his legs and tossed him overboard onto some jagged rocks forty feet below, only to jump down and smash his skull in on the following turn with his knee. Everyone else dealt with their targets in time to save him, but his arms were lost to the undead sharks that swam around the boat. \n\nHe was well and truly fucked after that, sure he had his legs, but he just didn't feel like a monk if he couldn't punch things. The rest of the party carried him along as they searched for what remained of the dragons treasure, giving him plenty of chances to prove his usefulness in other ways, but even after they found a portion of the forgotten horde, he was still depressed. They loaded up their ship and sailed back to the mainland, where they sold what they didn't need and bought their first player home, which came at a cheap cost, since they chose the haunted manor house they had previously cleaned out without anyone knowing about it. The real cost was repairing it...and their friend.\n\nI had several quests lined up for them to choose, but instead of sniffing for plot hooks or making their own, they tried to help their monk friend. An entire session went by with them going from place to place, trying to find someone to heal him, to restore him to his former glory, but no dice. Come the next session, his character was gone, left in the night, leaving behind a note of apology and farewells.   \n\n\nThe guy was replaced with a thief, who proved to be a decent substitute as he was the kind of thief who excelled in melee. The switch came from the desire of the player to try something new, and now seemed a good a time as any to swap over. With a full party, they tackled a good few threats and treasure hunts, slowly building a hefty reputation for themselves along the way, eventually forgetting about their armless friend as they rose to regional renown as champions for hire. But like all good campaigns, the good times had to eventually come to an end.\n\nThroughout the campaign I had always been hinting at strange happenings, monsters that have never been seen on the planet, or haven't been around for several eras, suddenly popping up out of nowhere, the woodlands growing far more lush and thick within the span of a few years, weather growing more intense with every passing day. It turned out, that their world had been chosen for the site of the next wild hunt. Every now and then, the wild hunt, a group of fae hunters, would choose a world and use magic to prepare it for their arrival, using it as a way to educate new members, and recruit new ones, while also establishing a foothold in reality for whichever fae lord who sponsored that particular event.  \n\n\nThe first encounter against one of the basic hunters nearly killed a few of them, mainly because i had modified the stats of these things, like giving the wild hunt scouts the ability to summon up dancing swords, but also because the party was 4 levels lower than what they needed to be to fight one of these things on equal terms. With a hasty retreat, they went back to the city to find that all the wildlife within the city had either been burned down or outright isolated. Bands of arcane spellcasters were preparing the city for an assault from the wilderness with spells to make trenches and reinforce the walls, even the sea port had it's gate closed for the first time in centuries. With some council from the local government, and some lore provided by the head of the local mage consortium, they figured out the best way to take down these things was with cold steel, fire, and anything that could harm chaotic creatures.   \n\n\nThey broke up for the day, which was me saying to the players \"do your own thing for the rest of the day, you've got enough money and time to do what you want for a bit\". So they did, helping out where they could and stocking up on tools for the next big story beat before meeting up with the council the following day. The parties rogue however, said he'd sit out on this one and wanted to return home to his city, as he had family there he wanted to protect.  \n\n\nWith everyone seated, the mayor made a little speech, going on about everything they already knew before calling out a familiar name. The doors open, and in strode their old monk friend. He was still missing his arms, but had something better in their place, two long prosthetic, made entirely out of cold iron, decorated with runes. He had traveled far to a different land, having gone on his own little adventure to get replacement arms and to learn new methods of fighting, only to return to rejoin his friends, finally made whole once more. In reality the player wanted to play his monk again because the rogue wasn't his cup of tea, but for story reasons, this was the justification.  \n\n\nNeedless to say, he made mince meat out of any fae creature they encountered, especially after having undergone the process of attaining levels in a prestige class we homebrewed called the fist of law. It had a few fun things, but the main bonus was to use \"smite chaotic\" at the cost of kai points, with the smite level being equal to the prestige class level\\+Wisdom modifer\\+Kai points spent.  \n\n\nBefore, he had been the secondary damage dealer after the glaive wielding fighter, now he was able to out damage him when he focus fired on single targets. His arms also had a fun little ability, reach. This meant that he could hit anyone ten feet away instead of just five, this meant that large numbers of weak enemies were only slightly less likely to die when near the monk, when compared to the fighter, who took a feat I made which allowed him to deal a single attack to every enemy within 10ft of him.  \n\n\nHis crowning achivement was during the final fight against the main hunting party of the wild hunt, who had decided to chase the party, for they were the most dangerous pray on the planet. They square off in the one place where neither party has an advantage over the other, a desolate flat plateau. A whole band of the wild hunt arrives on the agreed hour, archers, scouts, hounds, horses, and the monarch of the pack, terms are agreed upon, and the stage is set. Within the first round, two wish spells were fired off, one from the monarch, the other from the parties wizard. The plateau was suddenly transformed into miles and miles of rich, lush forest with towering trees sprouting up all around them, perfect for the wild hunt to use and abuse. The wizards wish? Mass death of every living thing within the same area.   \n\n\nThey had planned for this in advance, with everyone in the party wearing gear to protect them against the effect. The new woodland suddenly started to wither and die, and all the wild hunt hounds and horses dropped dead on the spot, now it was nine vs five. Or it would have been had the monk not used every thing he had in his bag of tricks to 'even' the odds.\n\nHe ran full pelt at the monarch and spent his first turn softening him up, mainly hitting him with things like stunning fist and the poison needles he had in his fingers to keep him locked down. The rest of the party protected him for what they thought was going to be a quivering palm attack to drop the monarch, but it was far more fun than that. He sweep kicked him when he tried to step back and disengage, and on his turn, unleashed a full round of smite chaotic strikes combined with a flurry of blows. I didn't realize that, mathematically speaking, it was better to use a single ki point to do a low level smite, for every blow inflicted with flurry of blows, than it was to burn them all on a single smite chaotic strike. All of this ignored damage reduction because of the cold iron arms, and when combined with the monks enchantment on said arms, which was inflicting 1d4 force damage on any hit, the total was enough for me to just let the monarch die. I'm not even sure how big the number was, but it was somewhere around 250 damage or more, and he had already taken 50 damage from the prior round. Just to be safe, the monk pulled his trump card out anyway, because this was the end of the campaign, he fired one of his fists at one of the scouts and punched a hole clean through his chest to celebrate.\n\nThey mopped up the rest, though it was harder than they expected since the wild hunt scouts and archers were equipped with special gear and skills, but no one died, and the party took the severed head of the monarch home, stuck it in a jar, and shoved it inside a monument within the town square, which was a giant bronze pyramid, sealing it inside. \n\nI learned two lessons during that campaign, don't allow smite to be used with flurry of blows, and critical hits don't always have to be about increasing the damage.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: We're all noobs when it comes to D&amp;D rules and such. We play with the 3.5 edition manual and some rules from 5th edition. We probably did a lot of stuff wrong that we didn't notice, so I apologize in advance for any weird stuff you may see\n\n&gt;We are 5 people (4 players and the GM). A human rogue (me), a human warrior, a half elf mage and an elf cleric. The Rogue was trained by a woman as his master, and wants to find three keys for a special chest that can't be opened by normal means. The Mage looks for a magic stone from her tribe that she thinks her father stole. The Cleric doesn't have any memories, and the Warrior doesn't explain his story.\n\n&gt;We start in a tabern that's attacked by goblins (represented by zombie figures of the game Zombies!). I'm the first one to be KO'd (we use the \"throw the dice, get 3 successes and come back with 1 HP\" system from 5th edition) and the Cleric helps me get on my feet. Our client complains that we're not really good professionals\n\n&gt;We're being hired to take a guy to some dungeon, and we get there flying on some kind of giant dragonflies with ships when we're attacked by air pirate goblins. The captain attacks our Warrior and \" kills\" him with one hit (the warrior had 8 HP, the captain used a 1d8 to attack. Bastard was basically a 1 hit KO)\n\n&gt;Our Mage freezes a goblin and I use my crossbow to shoot it. I get a 20 and the GM explains how the arrow seems to miss before hitting the frozen goblin on a finger and explodes into a shower of blood and chunks of meat. I use this opportunity to scare another goblin by using my Intimidate skill and succeed\n\n&gt;The captain runs back to his ship. Meanwhile our Warrior dies by failing his dice throws, but we forgive him (it's our first session ever. That would be a dick move) and I stabilize the Cleric, quoting \"quid pro quo\" (you scratch my back, I scratch yours) for helping me in the tavern\n\n&gt;The match is hard and the GM throws us a bone by having our client throw a pair of potions. We finally win and the Warrior gets the captain's magic sword with a +1 to attack. I try to bluff our client so I can get a bigger payment, but fail my throw and get told how useless I am for \"dying\" all the time\n\n&gt;We reach the dungeon and face our first challenge. The GM uses a Funko of the Night King's dragon as a dragon statue, telling us a riddle to solve or else we shall burn by his flames. We have a tablet with weird symbols (which includes an @, a guy being aimed by a crosshair and what looks like some kind of candelabra)\n\n&gt;I help decipher the hardest riddle (we had to solve four and press the symbols on the right order) and face the boss, represented by the Funko of the Night King (and then replaced by a zombie figure cause it's too fucking big) and three mummies\n\n&gt;A mummy goes after our client, and I try to defend him (because if he dies we won't get paid for this mission). I try burning the mummy, but all I do is make it worse cause these mummies are resistant to physical damage (also these fuckers heal) and now I have to face a fire mummy with +1 to attack\n\n&gt;The others tackle the boss cause they have magic attacks, and I eventually join them cause I can't do shit to this fire mummy. We joke about how \"this mummy is really hot. You certainly turned her on\" as I keep avoiding her attacks\n\n&gt;The Mage has a vision of the boss stealing the magic stone she's been looking for, and fails her throws (the GM says it's because the vision shocked her too much), while I hide behind a column avoiding the flaming mummy's attacks\n\n&gt;The Warrior passes me his magic sword instead of attacking the boss because I'm hiding behind a column (I can use Furtive Attack which at first allows me to attack without being seen, but we change it later to allow me to throw my dice again if I fuck up)\n\n&gt;The Warrior taunts the boss (basicallt saying \"Suck my dick!\") and focuses on him. Meanwhile I fail my attacks and eventually get a 1, throwing the sword at the boss's feet (but luckily the boss is too focused on the Warrior). \n\n&gt;The flaming mummy finally \"kills\" me, and my friends joke that I'm fucked in the ass by a huge mummy dick wrapped in bandages. Everyone laughs, myself included because it's hilarious in a weird way\n\n&gt;The Cleric finally kills the boss and our client grabs the dungeon key and dissappears (he wanted ro be the dungeon's owner or something. He basically dissappears and we don't get paid shit). \n\n&gt;We find the treasure room with three treasure chests. We find 400 gold (which we split 100 for player), a strange key and a shining stone (which the mage gets cause it's the one she was looking for). I want the key and my friends make me pay for it. I make a throw to avoid paying, but I fuck up so I end up with only 25 gold instead of 100\n\n&gt;The Warrior finds a sword on a statue and grabs it before allowing me to check for traps. He gets the sword but the dungeon floods, so we run away and get on the flying dragonfly ship and end the first campaign. We felt like this was a chaotic but entertaining adventure",

Some of my players have legacy characters that are children or grandchildren of their old characters. \n\nI would say that ~50 years has passed since the beginning of Hoard of the Dragon Queen.\n\n[My setting takes place in an adapted version of Forgotten Realms where Dragonborn are the ruling elite of a very Roman sort of empire.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/5bjos8/a_dragonborn_empire_biology_military_religion/)\n\nBack in HotDQ, I gave my players a prophecy about the crown prince, Chrysaetos Heliaca.\n\n[Acting upon that prophecy, one of my players murdered the prince in cold blood.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2w1be4/when_pcs_derail_your_campaign_via_unexpected/)\n\nWe continued the adventure, and eventually the players find their way to Nessus. They happen to find Chrysaetos locked up, and discover that the PC that murdered him was a \"Man in the Iron Mask\", and Chrysaetos' brother. They get the immortality McGuffin, return from Hell, and that PC's epilogue is that he becomes a demigod-Emperor.\n\nCampaign 2 is largely about bringing down the evil Emperor Rex. They inadvertently bring Chrysaetos back from the dead, and he wants revenge against his brother. He becomes an important ally for a while.\n\nHowever, during the course of things the PCs let slip to The Emperor that his brother is alive.\n\nChrysaetos is disappeared during the night, and nobody hears from him again.\n\n\nSome 9-10 months later, the players raid a vault of memories at a Neuromancer's guild.\n\nThey incidentally find the memories of Chrysaetos Heliaca, and discover that Emperor Rex personally tortured him and had his memories erased. He is now living as a soldier, Casval Ironjaw; an NPC they have met several times. They file this away, and never return to it.\n\nFast-forward one IRL year, and about 25 in-game years. The players (same people, different characters) have befriended a paranoid, crazy Dragonborn nobleman named Baron Richtophen, who is obsessed with his visions of mind flayers. Several adventures later, they find out that he is actually Chrysaetos Heliaca, and they get his memories back to him.\n\nChrysaetos, now in his right mind, is frantic to bring his knowledge of a coming mind flayer invasion to The Empress. He sends the players after a cache of his stuff, and tells them to meet him in The Capital.\n\nThey get the cache, which includes his crown from when he was a Prince, an amulet his mother made for him, and a  Centurion's ring of office.\n\nAll goes according to plan, and as they are preparing to sneak Chrysaetos in to open court before Her Excellency, the following conversation happens...\n\nPlayer 1: \"So this Empress, she's the lesbian princess chick from last campaign, right?\"\n\nPlayer 2: \"No. Her guard was a lesbian. *She's* straight, or bi at least.\"\n\nPlayer 3: \"Yeah. She hooked up with the guard in college, and Centurion Ironjaw during The War.\"\n\nPlayer 4: \"She's not totally straight, but what happens at boot camp-\"\n\nPlayer 1: \"WAIT! ... Whatever happened to Ironjaw!? He was awesome!\"\n\nAt this point, Player #2 and I lock eyes. We have both realized that nobody remembers Ironjaw = Chrysaetos. I start laughing my ass off. Player 2 just facepalms.\n\nMe: \"Let's get back on track, Chrysaetos has a speech.\"\n\nPlayer 1: \"No! We're not going anywhere, until we know what the fuck happened to Ironjaw.\"\n\nMe: \"Ah. Well, he was listed as a casualty of the battle of Evertree. He likely died leading the men while Princess Aquila was evacuated.\"\n\nPlayer 3: \"He died a hero. Good.\"\n\nThe game proceeds. They hijack the courtroom. The party bard enchants the guards with a wonderful song about the war hero, Casval Ironjaw.\n\nChrysaetos steps up to speak.\n\n“I will first beg the forgiveness of this court, the citizens here and Your Excellency. I mean no disrespect to the sanctity of this assembly by disrupting you so… I am Centurion Casval Ironjaw of the 4th Imperial legion. I… Served under your command, Your Excellency, and I have something important to say.\"\n\nBoom! Players 1, 3 and 4 lose their goddamned minds. Player 2 just sighs, \"Dudes. We KNEW this.\"\n\n\n\n(Just found out about this sub. Reposting something I just posted  elsewhere. Oooh boy! Do I have a backlog!)\n\n**Tl;Dr-** *The players find a recurring NPC with amnesia. They fix him up, and a discussion ensues about the fate of another NPC they forgot about. Recurring NPC reveals that he was that other NPC.*\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8osd46/honey_heist_the_honey_infinity_stone/",
        "text": "So since I first learned of the [simple, irreverent, and simply-irreverent one-page game Honey Heist last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/5z7yhu/honey_heist_is_a_free_onepage_roleplaying_game/), it has become a favorite of mine. I've run it as a one-shot replacement game, at parties, and just for the hell of it. Since it plays so fast, I recently also have tried running it for some students of mine over lunches (I teach high school). The following tale is just a sample of the hilarity that can result when one unleashes teenage creativity and tell them it's okay to swear in my classroom over lunch, I don't give a fuck.\n\nFirst some quick background: one of the ways I've modded the game is through a house-rule I made called **Hat Masquerade**. When rolling up their characters, players are allowed to randomly roll a hat for their bear because a big bear in a tiny hat is funny. Well, I took it a step further and say that whenever a player-bear has a hat on, it affects some sort of glamour, meaning that humans see the player as a large and somewhat hairy human in a hat, rather than a bear (players still can't talk clear English, though, so this leads to some very amusing confused interactions with NPCs). However, whenever the player does something physically demanding, I make them roll Criminal to see if the hat stays on. If they pass, no worries. If they fail, though, the hat flies off, theres a moment of silence as human NPCs around them stare, and then suddenly someone yells, \"Oh SHIT!! It's a BEAR!!!\" My players have also come up with further clever uses of Hat Masquerade, such as impersonating guards by stealing their hats, or purposefully removing their hats at the most dramatic moment to cause chaos around them.\n\nThe additional mod I made to this particular game was a lot simpler. In deference to the times--and the topic on every one of these kids' minds for the last many weeks--I declared that the super-prize they were searching for was the legendary **Honey Infinity Ston**e, which has the power to turn anything it touches into honey.\n\nI'm sure you can see where this is going. Trust me, it does not disappoint.\n\nSo, word spread of my game over the day and fully seven students showed up to play, along with one other teacher. The heist started off rather simply, with a couple bears running recon to get ID badges and a map of the con while the rest of the team waited in a bus outside. They figured out quickly that the Stone must be held in one of the locked rooms at the back of the hotel, but which one? They had exactly one hacker-bear and tried to get him into the tech room so he could hack the servers, but unfortunately the room was being guarded by the con organizer, a man who put together the con as a way to literally con the attendees and just pull as much money as possible. Some of the bears--under Hat Masquerade--tried to talk him into letting them into the tech room, but he cursed at them for being a bunch of damn furries and to gtfo.\n\nWell, at this point, the rest of the large group of bears are getting impatient and unanimously decide the best course of action is just to ram the bus into the front of the building.\n\nChaos ensues. The human con attendees panic and flee the building. Many of the bears add to the chaos by whipping off their hats and revealing themselves as bears. Hacker Bear intimidates Sleazy Con Organizer in the same fashion and intimates him into opening the tech room. At this, Hacker Bear becomes Bear-in-the-Chair and immediately unlocks all the rooms in the hotel while the rest of the team eats Sleazy Con Organizer. Bear-in-the-Chair discovers the location of the Honey Stone, but unfortunately *also* discovers that one of the rooms has been packed with explosives set by Sleazy Con Operator as part of an insurance scam. Bear-in-the-Chair also learns two more things 1) the bombs are set to go off in the next 15 minutes, and 2) the only person who had the code to deactivate them was Sleazy Con Operator. Whom they just ate.\n\nWhile half the team argue about what to do about the bombs, another team member makes a dash for the Honey Stone. The room is unlocked, but unfortunately he forgot about the laser trip-wire, so the moment he steps across the doorway, alarms go off across the building, along with announcements that SWAT is on its way. Keeping cool, this bear carefully puts on the ring the Honey Stone is set in--\n\n--And discovers that *wearing* the Honey Stone One Ring immediately corrupts you.\n\nSo--sirens going off, chaos still reigning--Ring Bear turns on the rest of the party. Another party member tries to stop him and remove the ring, but Ring Bear touches him with the stone to turn *him* into honey. Good Bear fights back valiantly, trying to bite off Ring Bear's paw as his own body dissolves away into honey, but sadly it isn't enough, and he melts into a puddle as Ring Bear stands over him, cackling.\n\nOnly to be immediately tackled by another party member who grabs the ring and runs.\n\nMeanwhile, everyone is still yelling about the bombs, slowly ticking down to zero, and also helicopters pound overhead as SWAT arrives at the building. One of the bears runs to the front to Bear-Out and scare the SWAT guys into forming a perimeter instead of rushing the building. Then another bear decides to handle two bees with one stone by grabbing the bombs and running them out the building to throw at the SWAT teams.\n\nHoney Stone in hand, the bears rush back to the bus, which is still parked halfway through the front-wall of the hotel. Ring Bear--now without the ring and no longer evil--mourns his melted comrade and carefully scrapes together all his honey into a jar to take with them and hopefully find a way to resuscitate later. Everybody piles in and, while explosions rock the SWAT teams and kick up extra dust and chaos out front--the bears make their getaway, flooring it to race back through town and hit the highway to freedom *just* as the bell rings to signal the end of lunch.\n\n[Photographic evidence of what my whiteboard looked like at the end of the chaos here](https://i.imgur.com/1aXnjr4.jpg).\n\n*Honey Heist is a free-to-play game by /u/gshowitt .

        "text": "So we leveled up after the last session.  Rickard chooses the Thief path, Alice becomes an Eldritch Knight (her powers manifest after the stress of the battle) and Nez.\n\n&gt; Nez sits bolt upright. Rickart and Alice, tending to his wounds, jump back, startled.  He turns his head slowly, and focuses smartly on a nearby tree, just one of many. He scrambles over to it and begins digging.  Just under the surface, Nez finds something... he pulls it form the ground and it is a boo, bound in black leather.  The black is so deep, it almost seems like you could reach into it.  Its corners are bound in intricately fashioned silver, with deep red trim. Embedded in the leather cover is a scale.  A blue dragon scale.  Nez reaches to his forehead and feels the scarred dent where he lost a few scales, then caresses the scale on the cover.  He knows it is his.  \n\n&gt; He opens the cover, and most fo the book is blank.  The first few pages each display a complex mandala.  When Rickard asks if he knows what they mean, he nods.\n\nPact of the Tome is pretty cool and we had a lot of fun designing his book.  Each page is a spell he knows, and it will fill itself in over time.\n\n&gt; Rickart, Alice, Nez &amp; Couth make their way to the Temple, drawing closer to a raucous cacophony at the front of the building.  In an effort to remain hidden, they approach the rear from the south, suing the outer wall for cover. Reconnaissance reveals six kobolds shoveling hay onto a smoldering pile and generating large quantities of smoke, being directed by two cultists.  Rustling in the long grass surrounding the wall belies the presence of more ambush drakes.  \n\n&gt; The group then hears a large and noisy mob making their way along the west wall, coming around to the south.  They are chanting \"TI-A-MAT! TI-A-MAT! TI-A-MAT!\" and dancing in a condensed huddle. The group quickly devises a plan.  Rickart does not fit any of the captured cultist's robes they have, so he will hide under Couth's robes while Nez casts Disguise Self and changes his appearance to that of a human. Then they will merge with the revelers, and get close to the back door and find a way in to rescue the villagers captured inside.  A simple plan, but nothing is ever as simple as it seems.\n\nI failed my Strength check to hold onto Couth.\n\n&gt; While clambering over the wall, Rickart loses hold and drops to the ground, covered by the long grass near the wall.  The rest of the group is unaware of this immediately, and continues to merge into the group.  They begin to move, Alice mimicking the dancing of the revelers perfectly; Nez, flailing his arms overhead randomly, and Couth simply bobbing his head in the rhythm of the beating drums.\n\nAlice crit her performance roll - sweet.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, as Rickart tries to figure out how to proceed without revealing himself, he feels hot breath on his neck and hears a snuffling noise.  An ambush drake approaches, curious. Rickart stays very, very still.  The drake nudges and paws him lightly, and Rickart attempts to keep it calm.\n\nI aced the Animal Handling roll.  At this point the other players have already determined that this will be my pet, perhaps a mount. They have formed a very quick attachment tot his idea.  I am not so sure.\n\n&gt; A second drake approaches, showing more aggression.  Seeing the subject of his curiosity threatened, drake the first tussles with his rival.  Rickart remains motionless, lest he draw any attention from the drakes, or the cultists only a few feet away.  \n\n&gt; The crowd of revelers moves around the building and drifts away to the north-east, heading around the building again.  The three party members hang back, and are soon standing alone among the kobolds.  The two cultist supervisors look at the group and one of them says \"...you mind taking over for a bit?\" Alice readily agrees, and the cultists soon follow the revelers. Alice attempts to relieve the kobolds of their duty, but they don't understand.\n\n&gt; Couth determines that Rickart is not there almost immedaitely, but cannot do much about it.  However he notices rustling in the long grass, and move closer to investigate.  He sees Rockart and the tussling drakes, and Rickart gives him a pleading look. Couth approaches, but is quickly deterred by the drakes and backs off.\n\nCouth's Animal Handling roll was not as good as mine.\n\n&gt; The curious drake sends the agressive one packing, and returns his attention to his prize.  It attempts to lie down on Rickart, who rolls out of the way of its body, but not its heavy paw.  He attempts to soothe it, so he can get away.  It shows no aggression, but also does not let go.  Rickart attempts to climb onto the beast, but is instead picked up gently in its mouth, and it begins to move towards to kobolds.\n\nAnother couple of excellent AH rolls follow, but I can't stop it gumming me.  I'm in trouble...\n\n&gt; It pads up to the kobolds and drops Rickart on the ground.  A kobold's eyes go wide, and he starts to shout \"Impos-\" but finds his throat pierced by Alice's sword. The last thing he hears is \"Shhhhhh...\" All disguises are revealed, and Nez lets fly some eldritch blasts while Alice drops her sword and switches to her whip.  Kobold blood flies in the night air.  Couth aims a mighty blow at a kobold, but misses.  He makes a half-hearted attempt to pass this off as deliberate, sees that it isn't working, catches himself being foolish and slams his fists on each side of the kobold's head, bursting it like a ripe melon.\n\nWe had a LOT of fun RP'ing this series of atrocious rolls by the NPC. \n\n&gt; Alice's whip cracks against the drake, and it's attention swerves from Rickart, exposing its belly.  He quickly slides his rapier in its chest and through its heart.  He mumbles \"I'm more of a dog person.\"\n\nI never believed for a second this thing had any intention other than to consume my flesh.  I got the DM to confirm this after the session.  This was never going to be a pet.\n\n&gt; The kobolds and drakes dispatched, Rickart rushes to the door to find it barred from the inside.  As he tries to devise a plan to open it, Nez declares that he can do it, and disappears, a wreath of dark smoke swallowing him from the ground up.  He reappears just inside the door, adn turns to see a group of villagers, huddled and terrified.  He says \"Don't worry - we need a few minutes to open this door and get you to safety, and everything will be all right.\"  On the edge of terror and being addressed by a giant blue dragon-man, the villagers start screaming.  Nez does not register this - he simply turns, unpertyurbed, and moves to open the door.\n\n&gt; TO BE CONTINUED...\n\nThis was the most fun we have had to date.  For on thing, it was the first battle that did not immediately get out of our control - we managed it throughout.  The side-plot with the drake was properly tense, and very funny.  We all had our cool moments, and we are not totally spent for next session (we have not had a long rest for several sessions now, and we are all out of hit dice).  We will have to see how we get everyone out!",

        "text": "Sorry for taking a few days before posting the next one folks.  Well, if anyone's really following this.  Between a new diet, exactly what a mess the last game session turned out to be, at least in terms of plans derailed (Curse you, Norse goddess!  You ruined HALF my game plan by jumping the gun instead of letting us get to Prometheus first!) and SURTR as a fight, it went not as well as planned in anything but roleplay.  Considering we had to call the game at 1/3rd of the way through that fight against Surtr, I had a lot of planning before I could resume writing this.\n\n\nBut I digress.  I did recall one other attempt to find that Mad Hatter fellow and it was a rather decent one.  Lead to a decent fight, and decent rewards.  Kieran used, during that very first encounter with him, a spell to allow him to track the Mad Hatter for a single day.  We used this to try to track the fellow down.\n\n\nWhen we landed in a huge underground cavern, with a massive lake in the middle, we were worried.  Especially when we started hearing him brag about his Jabberwocky.  Giant Nemean Crocodile.  Keep in mind, that the Nemean template in Scion doubles physical attributes, size, and health levels, before boosting it even further depending on the legend value.  So we're talking about a 30, 40 foot crocodile here.  After a good 30 minutes of fighting, we managed to put the big monster down, only to find that in the melee, the Mad Hatter had escaped.  Thankfully my skills were enough that we were able to skin it, resulting in us having a huge amount of Nemean Crocodile hide.  After much bargaining, we eventually worked out a deal with Carmine Falcone to have the hide treated to make jackets for us, in return for favors, as well as the teeth turned into throwing knives for us.  The jackets, and spare hide, have done us well for this entire game.  Mine lasted until God level before it bit the dust.\n\n\nSo.  Where was I.  Ah, yes.  Where we left off, we'd escaped from the Gotham Arboretum, and the mistress thereof, having narrowly avoided being turned into fertilizer by minature clay golem copies of Mokkurkalfi.  We vote to head home, and recover, only to find the Mad Hatter's corpse, and a smug Fenris.  A lot of grumbling ensued, mostly about how much work it was going to be to clean up after him eating the fellow indoors, while we decide on a game plan.\n\n\nWith nothing better to do, we decide to try and hit Arkham Asylum again, since that seems like it might be a good place to investigate for my own characters search.  Entering, we start exploring, only to immediately find our first opponent.  A zombie soldier armed with a bazooka.  Thankfully, his first attack doesn't manage to get us.  So, while I snipe at him, trying to keep him from hitting us, Lucas sneaks around, attempting to get to him from behind.  Unfortunately for poor Lucas, once he got our target up close and personal, my next shot not only HIT the zombie's arm holding the bazooka, but punched a hole RIGHT through the arm, impacting the shell.  It sent Lucas flying, and sent him down pretty far in terms of health, to the point where we had to leave so he could recover.  To be fair, this was the second time he's been blown up in the game.  We had to be careful and make sure it wouldn't become a running theme.\n\n\nOnce we get back, we have... more plot!  In the form of Katherine Kane, who's willing to trade us Wayne Manor as house sitting, in return for the rest of us also working as bodyguards for her on occasion.  It's a pretty sweet deal for us.  We get a neat mansion as a base, so we accept as the live in staff.  And thus, I have to help out with bodyguard work, as well.  Cue us going off for a party, as bodyguards for her.  I'm stuck with the Yata no Kagami, which I've started to take a liking to as a weapon over the rifle I've been using.  And to be fair, my rifle is a decent one.  I'd just noticed that the Yata no Kagami tended to hit better, not fully realizing the issue with firearms in Scion.  To be fair, I've worked out some ways around those methods with Kieran's houserules.  But I digress, and those don't come along for quite a while yet.\n\n\nKatherine Kane needs one of us close by.  So I'm stationed in the crouds, while Lucas is by her side at all times.  We chose to have Kieran stay behind and guard the girl, so rather than having our GM PC with, we had Fenris in the van, ready to leap out and maul anyone I pointed him at.  Keep in mind that Fenris is a 500 pound wolf, and thus hard to hide, but he does aggravated damage with his bite, so having him around is well worth it if he can get a hit in.\n\n\nAs I'm searching the crouds, cue the introduction of, as Kieran put it, \"The Catwoman to your Batman for this game\": Tammamo no Mae (I know it's spelled differently by different people.  I'm using the GM's naming for this, since the GM made her character sheet), of Fate/Extra and Fate/Grand Order fame, as a daughter and Scion of Amaterasu.  Who, in those games, uses a mirror as a weapon much like how I've been using the Yata no Kagami as a weapon.  I think I'll leave it here for now, since I'm tired, and my insomnia's finally wearing off, though.",

        "text": "In this group, all of us were pretty well read, I less so than the rest because I've always been more of a videogame nerd, but I still read a decent amount. One day we decided to just say fuck it and do a call of cthulhu campaign because the last campaign in pathfinder had ended in a TPK at the worst possible moment. We set it in the 1970's, with the characters being american spy's and soldiers working in berlin during the time the allies and stalin were slicing the city up, lots of political stuff, even had the party help try to extract a british spy and a women trying to climb the wall, but they both died.  \n\n\nWhenever I use CoC, I actually tend to use it for normal gumshoe detective stories, rather than lovecraftian, simply because it's perfect for roleplay without much combat. But this being after world war 2, I couldn't help myself but let something eerie slip in every now and then, like the deep howl of a wolf coming from the wall, or strange, palid skinned people moving back and forth between the berlin wall and the western side of the city, mumbling like crazy people. It all came to a head when one of the informants for the party, a man who lived very close to the wall, and was an insanely good shot with a crossbow at night, stopped firing his 'bolt messages'.\n\nOne quick trip to a friendly embassy and they had fake uniforms and fake ID's, they wouldn't last them longer than a few days, tops, but that's all they needed. The party consisted of an old spy, he was a 'guts and emotion' kind of man who wasn't super smart, but very willful and skilled. Next was a pencil pusher academic who was the resident book nerd, and after him there were two special ops soldiers who were the muscle, one was a field medic, the other was the designated mechanic/driver. With their backgrounds and skill checks they got through and to the eastern side of the wall without trouble and proceeded to the vantage point from which the crossbow bolts were usually fired. It wasn't what they expected.  \n\n\nNormally, the Abteilung were thorough, no blood, no mess, only a smart man could hide something from one of their sweeps. What they found was smashed furniture, a broken window, a crossbow bolt sunk into the wall and the strong stench of chemicals. They figured out that the window had been broken from the outside, the way the furniture was broken indicated heavy weight slamming on it, and that the chemical stench was either ammonia or some sort of rotting bodily fluid. There was also no blood, not a single drop.   \n\n\nTen seconds after they noticed the lack of blood, the medic said, ooc.\"A monster smashed in through the window and pounced on him before he had time to react, knocked him out or scared him half to death, thus causing him to piss himself before it took him out through the window again.\" He also deduced that because there had been no reports from guards or their side that there had been any sign of such an abduction, this creature was either part of the russian forces, or it lived in the sewers, as there was a manhole very near the building. Fucker called it, slap dab on the nose.  \n\n\nThey searched the nearby manhole cover to find that it had been moved recently, went down there, and they found the crossbow. They took it along with the other bolts they found in the apartment and continued along until they stumbled upon a passage way lined with cages, most of them were empty, but those occupied housed hunched over, long fanged creatures. The medic, again, figured out what they were.\" Oh look, feral vampires.\" Sanity rolls for everyone!\n\nThey went to the other end of the hall, killing the vampires as they went by shooting them with the bolts, which I reluctantly gave them some sanity back for. They opened the door at the end to find a small jail room, several cages lining it, each one occupied by gaunt, withered, half dead people who had been mostly drained of blood, mostly. By being smart, the mechanic figured out they were directly below one of the guard barracks near the wall. Their informant was within the cell, moaning lowly in pain as he reached out to try and grasp at them. When they took his hand, he dropped a roll of paper into it, and promptly died. The medic studied the documents down there, specifically the large leatherbound tome with a long bone for a book spine, he took sanity damage, but gained \\+10 to his lovecraftian lore. In a moment of temporary insanity, he unlocked the door to the dead informant, took his saw from his backpack...and chopped the corpses head off. \n\nSome roleplaying later about the incident happened, then the rest of the group tried to question the other people in there, some where people who had tried to climb over the wall, others were similar to their informant friend, someone who had been trying to contact the outside by sending things over it at night, or just simply walking near the wall after sundown. Turns out those vampires weren't feral, but trained and tamed to hunt within a set distance of the wall every night, capture anyone they found after draining them of blood, and then bring them back to the cells.  \n\n\nIn the end the rest of the prisoners had nothing useful to say, so they all left and went back to their side of the wall while hiding that severed head, keeping the mans last note in hand. The moment they got home though, to an apartment building \\(one which they entered seperately via various secret entrances\\), the medic asked if he could have the head and try something with it, they all reluctantly agreed, and he...rolled to reanimate it. Using a combination of his chemistry skill and his newfound lovecraftian lore, he managed to produce a similar concoction to that found within herbert west reanimator, injected it into the head, and tada! He now had a talking head companion.\n\nThey got all the information they wanted out of him and more before the medic tied the head to his belt and carried it around like a talking trophy. The campaign got exceedingly weird after that, as the medic took the head everywhere he went, often using it in intimidation and scare tactics to freak the russians out, all seriousness went out the window when he bowling balled the head to some guards and it yelled \"ogabogabooga!\"  \n\n\nThe campaign was still a serious cold war style affair, but now with some lovecraftian elements tossed in to spice things up, but none of them took it seriously after that, to a point where they started quoting evil dead after shotgunning a russian soldier in the back of the head, only to stick the reanimated head on the body, and then reanimate it as well. I retroactively started removing one sanity point from the medic every time it was used, which added up pretty fast, since he had low sanity to begin with. But it all came to a head when he was at two sanity.  \n\n\nThe group was now on the run from the russians in the eastern side of berlin after having killed a high ranking officer. The spy decided it would be best for them to try and distract them with the head one last time, stuff it with explosives, and then detonate it when they got close enough. It worked, but the loss of his friend drove the medic over the edge and he stripped naked, ran down the street and started quoting cthulhu passages as he covered himself in resurrection fluid from the last needle vial. the rest of the group left him and carried on while the medic snapped his own neck, brought himself back to life and then ran headlong into a hail of gunfire screaming like a banshee.\n\nThe rest of the group escaped, and the russians now had an immortal insane undead man in their captivity. I decided that, if we were going to go full camp, we might as well have russian zombies invading the western side of berlin. That was when we changed to world of darkness for the hunters rulebook, kept the mental stats from all of cthulhu and had a spy, a nerd, a mechanic and a priest fight hordes of lovecraftian zombies to kill super zombie stalin.",

        "text": "So my friends and I wanted to introduce some others to roleplaying, but we wanted to do it slowly and focus on the more silly and fun aspects of it. So my guys called and gathered together about ten people in total. Yes, ten people, eleven if you include myself. They all came to this office one of the other guys owned \\(long story, he owned this office building\\), we all brought food, a videogames console and a big TV. The reason being we were going to work in groups of two, with myself acting as the main dungeon master who oversaw it all and ran one of the games, while my buddy, who we'll call Fisk, ran the other game. Anyone else who just wanted to watch, and then either got bored or hungry, could go and play super smash bros brawl on the WII.  \n\n\nI handled the group of five while fisk took the group of four. They all sat down and we briefly explained the rules before splitting up, the players all wrote down their name, their goal and three things they were good at before I took away all the pens, told them to turn over their paper, and get ready. \n\nJohn was at home watching the presidential election results, getting really nervous over it, so nervous in fact that he accidentally drank some fluid from a lava lamp and had a seizure before being taken over by a persona with a crazy indian accent and hateful tendencies. First things first, he set about making a bomb, gathered all the guns in the house, got in the car and started driving, making sure to run over every pedestrian along the way so he could maximise his time in control. But he eventually lost out to a creepy, soft spoken women who...continued to do the same thing until she got to an airport, drove through the barriers and took control of a plane, flying it high into the sky as she made her way north east. As she was alone, and there wasn't anything attacking her, she had to pass control over to someone else. But we time skipped to a point where he was, in fact, over new york, with fighter jets tailing him. The next persona was a drunken homeless man who proceeded to try and crash the plane into the hudson river, where in he failed, hit the bridge, and managed to skip his body like a stone across the water after smashing through the windscreen. Next persona? A sassy african sounding women who beat the shit out of some new yorker cabby, took his car, and bolted off along the sidewalk until she crashed, nearly killed john again, and was replaced by the insane indian once more.  \n\n\nHe got a bus to washington after mugging a blind man, stealing his clothes, and swapped attire. One time skip later, and the forth persona was, and i kid you not, darth vader. he had \"force usage\" as one of his skills. But instead of getting off the bus and heading somewhere else, he stayed on until he got to washington, still heavily armed with a dufflebag filled with explosives and guns. He marched up to the whitehouse, using the force to get past the guards and the crowd as trump stood on the podium, giving his speech. Word for word, this is exactly what he said.\"I want to use the force to snap off his neck, stick the lava lamp bomb down it and detonate it to spray gore over the entire crowd while i laugh like an asshole.\" He makes the roll, does exactly that....then everyone asks the same question, and when i say everyone, this includes the players on the other table as well. They all ask what happens if someone elses goal is the same as theirs, and it gets completed.\n\nThey all turned their paper over, and they all read, as the goal, something along the lines of \"kill donald trump\" or \"kill the president.\"\n\nWe decided to modify the rules after that, so now i can see what everyones card says before we even begin, played another round, then all of us sat around and tried to play legend of zelda twilight princess in the exact same manner as we had just played 'everyone is john'.",

        "text": "During one of my campaigns, one of the players characters had died, it was because of a doppleganger or something, it doesn't really matter. The player decided to make a stereotypical old mage, the guy was seventy two, super smart, and could rival the other arch mages of the world with his ability to wield 8th level magic, but not 9th. I scanned through it and approved everything, took note of the birthday and his age, along with other stuff, like perception and saving throws.   \n\n\nHe and the rest of the party met up while flying through dimensions, smashing into each other within a pocket plane of sorts on the ethereal plane, from there they all left and went back down to the planet they came from in order to stop the bastard prince from usurping the throne. They did dick about in the planes a bit first, for a few weeks, then landed back down on the planet to continue the fight. A civil war they had tried so hard to prevent erupted, dividing the nation, as well as the alliances of other nations with it, causing all out conflict across the land which lasted for nearly a year.  \n\n\nStep by step, they slaughtered their way past the enemy soldiers to kill off the general, ensuring victory on one of the fronts, one of the last before they were able to push towards the enemy capital of Urungan. After the battle, they celebrated, with the chief of their side making a massive ass cake to celebrate the wizards birthday. We all had a good laugh then, using it as an excuse to just fuck about and stuff...But then something popped into my mind. What was the wizards maximum age? The answer was discovered when he rolled two D20's.  \n\n\nThe mage died, face first into his slice of cake, his old body not being able to sustain him anymore. They couldn't even resurrect him because it's impossible to revive those who pass away like that. I honestly didn't know whether to laugh or feel sorry for the guy, the whole group just gave him this rueful look and we all laughed and cried. The guy made a third character on the spot while the rest of the party gave him a decent funeral, ten minutes later and his replacement was ready, a young elven prince, we are talking 170 years old, just past puberty.",
