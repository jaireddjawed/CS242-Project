I always have issues with consistent connection when it comes to downloading and playing games. I called the provider and gave them control over my computer and had them do the internet speed test. It clocked in at 17mbps which is great and at functional levels. I explained that the speed is fine its just inconsistent and had him watch as i downloaded Arma 3 for shit and giggles. We started out strong at 2 mbps but it eventually fell to 300kbs per second and then steadily climbed and fell back and forth. Only ever making it back to 1.2 mbs then dropping quickly to 300kbs. \n\nIs this acceptable? The tech support seem to think I was in the wrong for expecting a better performance and that i just didn't understand how bandwidth worked.  I have used better connections in the past that allowed for online gaming and downloading at more consistent levels.\n\nIs there anything i can do to help fix the problem?\n\nIm just frustrated with these Canadian cocksuckers ripping us off for shit service... thanks for letting me rant. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Glastonbury festival tickets were released this morning at 9am, and every year the website appears to crash with most people stuck connecting and never getting a response. The next stage, once it connects, is a landing page that automatically refreshes every 20 seconds, waiting to go through to the main page where it's possible to buy tickets.\n\nThe idea is that you buy them in groups of six, so we had six people on different internet connections trying on both normal ADSL / fibre optic broadband (Sky, Virgin Media and University library) and on their mobile phone internet (4G). I was on the university internet with speed test results of 130Mbps download, 120Mbps upload and roughly 15ms ping. Almost everyone, including me, got through to the landing page several times on 4G but didn't get anything on their laptop, and we ended up getting tickets through a 4G connection on a phone. Last year we didn't get through, but I heard about other people that got through on 4G.\n\nDoes anyone know why it's much more likely to get through on 4G? I thought that it would be primarily based on internet speed but surely 4G is not faster and more reliable than a fibre optic broadband connection. Are there any other factors that increase chances of getting through?\n\nThis is the most relevant subreddit that I could think of, if anyone knows anywhere else that would be more relevant then let me know.

I'd like to know the most space efficient way to store them.\n\nMy gut tells me that it should be possible to create some kind of checksum, given a set of tickets, with the ability to tell me if a given value is in the set.\n\nIs this possible?

So each client sends a ticket (UUID) with the command. If something goes wrong, and the client don't know if the command reached the component it can resend the command with the same ticket, if the server has already processed the command with the given ticket it should ignore it (trying to get one step closer to \"only once delivery\").\n",

If it helps, I can provide input as an array of pairs (*e*, *n*) where *e* is an element and *n* is how often it appears. I can even provide this array sorted in any possible way. In my current use case (chess programming) elements can appear at most twice, but I'm also interested in a solution where elements can appear more often.",

Could I get some help understanding how sandboxing of programs works exactly? \n\nFor instance, how would a program prevent a sandboxed program from using excessive amounts of CPU, and memory resources? How does a sandbox restrict permission of files, and file systems?\n\nAny further reading or other resources are appreciated. Thanks!\n\nEdit:\nSome more information because I am a fool for not including it right away. \n\nI need to be able to harden a Raspberry Pi from malicious activity.
