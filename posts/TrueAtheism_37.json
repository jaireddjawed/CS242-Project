I've seen this talked about in debates as well, and many variations of this sort of thing seems to come up, like how there were no early accounts of Jesus during his life because 'very few people knew how to write at the time'. \n\nThe argument seems to boil down to \"We may have no historical records that prove me right, but we also have no historical records to prove me wrong, therefore I could be right.\" Couldn't one also claim any manner of thing to have happened historically within any grey area of history and say that they're right because no conflicting historical account proves them wrong?

Apparently this is an issue.\n\nWas asked why I feel this way about the religion. I said that Christianity for the most part is selfish and wholly concerned with salvation and not compassion to man, and that if God were such a merciful being then he would judge man by her/his character and not his worldview. But no, apparently this means that I just haven't been exposed to the right church. Or read the bible, according to them.\n\nI just don't get why it's so important for Christians and Muslims to convince others they're the ones that are in the right. Surely they must realize that this gives the \"Christianity is selfish and harmful\" argument merit. \n\nso they want me to pray every day and write in a journal my prayer progress and visit churches. I plan on doing the visit churches thing because it'll be out of mutual respect for my family as well as be an experience, and I love people so why not? I doubt it'll stop my buddhist journey and won't stop my will to take precepts.\n\nDo chrisitians really think this  method does their religion favors?\n\n",

Every summer, our high school ministry allows high schoolers to go on a mission trip in the Chicago area or to Latin America. 3 years ago, I went on their trip to Milwaukee as a devout Christian and had a very spiritual experience. By that time next year, I was a nonbeliever and had to go on the same trip again. The cognitive dissonance was very frustrating during my week on the trip, and the \"Christian\" act was very hard to keep up by the end of the week. They had sermon/worship sessions once per day every day that week.\n\nI managed to keep from going on a trip last year on the pretense that I would for sure go on one this summer. As you can imagine, the sign ups for the trips have started, and this time, my parents want to send me to Ecuador. Everyone else in my immediate family (other than my younger brothers) has gone on this trip, so they all think that it is important that I go to keep up the tradition, like a bandwagon. While I would love to help my fellow men, it would be very difficult to mentally put up with everything that happens on that trip. I will be revealing my atheism to my older sister tomorrow because I don't think I can go through this on my own (she is financially independent, don't worry), and was wondering, what suggestions do you guys have for my situation? I mean the mission trip part, not the sister part. Should I go? If I don't go, it would lead to me having to tell my parents about atheism as a justification, but I think they would be accepting of it.",

It's noticeably a late-new athiest argument. It quotes heavily from earlier New Atheist works, from Dawkins and the rest. It then basically goes through certain bible chapters and criticises them verse-by-verse. This has rather a negative tone of course. So, I find it a little surprising that his stance on criticism of Islam is so different to his approach to Christianity. GHYHHB doesn't particularly discuss Christian behaviour or the social problems associated with Christianity (as Sam Harris does). It is all about the text. It therefore seems appropriate to write a commentary on the Koran in the same way.\n\nI think it is probably true that oppression and economic injustice exacerbates religious fundamentalism. I just don't think that this should save the texts, or the behaviour of the faithful from criticism.",

That's how I thought anyway. I always believed the theory of evolution as truth, that we all just came from the slime. When we, when we died, you know, that was it, there is nothing ... \n\n(Copied from [Wikiquote](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer))\n\n**Discussion:** \n\n I think most atheists (who proclaim their atheism in one way or another) are faced with this question: \"Well, if you don't believe in a god, then where do your morals come from?\" - for me this came from my family as the first question. \n\nIt's a pretty easy argument, or question, to answer: “An intelligent person does not need the Promise of heaven to see the merit of good deeds.” And it can be a scary thought to think (some) theists are basically claiming they're on the edge of horrible acts if only for their belief in a god who would punish them for it.\n\nJeffrey Dahmer knew what he was doing was wrong: it all started as thoughts that he kept to himself because he knew they weren't normal, they evolved into fantasies over the years and by the end he was stuck in that fantasy world where he would (attempt to) alleviate his sexual frustrations by the grotesque acts he performed on others. \n\nWhen it all came out, when his parents learned the truth, when he was faced with the reality of his fantasies and the atrocity of it all, he needed a way out, a way past the guilt. Religion gave him that exit. \n\nHe could not only reconcile his previous monstrous actions, but according to the Christian faith he has been forgiven since he has proclaimed Jesus Christ as his lord and savior.\n\n**Topics/questions:** \n\n* From what you've experienced, would the Christians you know claim that Dahmer is in fact saved by the grace of god now? \n\n* How have you dealt with the \"where does your morality come from\" question? Are there certain approaches that work better than others in your experience? \n\n* What is the missing element to go from \"there are no morals since we all came from slime\" to \"an intelligent being knows that hurting other intelligent beings is an evil act\" - Dahmer was obviously an intelligent person, [able to trick 2 police officers into letting him keep an escaped 14 year old boy he had already drugged and started molesting.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Balcerzak) \n\n(For me it's the simple fact that I should treat others how I want to be treated)\n\n* Do you think religion can help an \"evil person\" to fight amoral desires at all, a little, or completely?\n \n\nI just came across this part of the interview and it kind of caught me off guard. There seems to be some opportunity for deeper discussion out of this and am wondering what others' thoughts are. \n\nCheers.  \n",

Due to a variety cultural and social factors, it can be really hard to break away from religion. I'd say it rivals the social pressure of general bible-belt faith expectations and adds an extra heavy dose of political, historical and activism identity that can make a person feel as if walking away from religion is a denial of everything that is said to have been meaningful for blacks in America.\n\nSo when I joined an organization of black non-believers, it was a huge relief to find others there who shared my worldview and understood the struggles that we face within our own communities and families.\n\nOne of the founders posted a 2014 recap and I thought I'd share it with you. I'm excited about the organization's 2015 plans to work with another organization called Inner City Science for Youth. To me, this is so important. Inspiring a love of science in kids is really important but particularly in the black inner city where, sadly, sometimes there's an anti-intellectual strain that isolates kids who do well in school. \n\nThey also have plans to work with an organization called New Turn which presents secular solutions to prevent recidivism. \n\nI'd never heard of either of those organizations before the post, but I think it illustrates some of of differences is focus that black atheist groups sometimes have to have. Because of the high rate of religious belief in our community, we combine our atheism with other social justice related issues in order to begin having an impact. \n\nI hope my post doesn't come off spammy. I was just excited about the 2015 direction of the groups and thought it might shed some light on the mindset and disposition of black atheist organizations, which often, people will ask: why do you need/want a separate organization? I'm really proud of how visible this organization has become (the founder and some members are being interview for CBS Sunday Morning next week!) and I also wanted to show, in addition to caring about separation of church and state, how our focus is often more broadly socio-politically oriented.\n\nhttps://blacknonbelievers.wordpress.com/2015/01/02/bns-year-in-review-2014/",

        "text": "So I was born and raised in a Jewish family.  We did Passover every year.  \n\nFor those who don't know - Passover is a holiday that, in North America, is highlighted by two 'feasts' of a sort.  The feast - an elaborate dinner - has a set of well defined rituals and the entire dinner is done according to a book of songs, stories, and prayers.  In Israel they do one night - outside they do two nights.  \n\nThe dinner is called a 'seder' - the hebrew word for 'order' - and the meal is conducted according to a book called a 'haggadah' - a book of readings.  \n\nBasically the entire purpose of the seder is the retelling and reinforcement of the story of the exodus of Jewish slaves from Egypt. There is saltwater served to represent the tears of the slaves, bitter herbs (horseradish) to represent the bitterness of the slaves lives - and so on - all very symbolic. It's the one dinner that every Jew is expected to make it home for and ultimately assume the role of hosting when their parents age.\n\nI daresay that every Jew I grew up with accepted the premise(s) that the Jews were enslaved by the Egyptians and that they at some point escaped this enslavement.  The story is embellished with tales of plagues visited upon the Pharaohs for failing to release the Jews - ten of them to be exact - ranging from turning the rivers to blood, locusts, hail, darkness, etc. up to the slaying of the Egyptian first born male child by the angel of death.  The term Passover comes from the notion that Jewish families sacrificed an animal and painted their door lintels with the blood of the sacrifice - the angel of death then 'passed over' their marked homes and left their children unharmed.\n\nI can't stress enough that this story is told as historical fact.  I don't know a Jew who doubts it (well, maybe recently - but not &gt; 10 years ago)\n\nMore recently much doubt has been cast on whether this story is true or whether it's a myth.  I'm not a historian (nor do I play one on TV) so I can only say that as much as I'm qualified to review historical evidence it seems that this whole story is just one big fable.  (don't c&amp;p this last line and go hog wild - I qualify this in a moment)\n\nIf that's the case it really throws the whole rest of the story (parting of the red sea, burning bush, wandering in the desert, ten commandments etc.) that all follow into fable as well. \n\nOf course I know that all the tall tales are simply that - tall tales - burning bushes, mannah from heaven - all that stuff is just myth/parable/allegory.  But at some level I always thought that the *fundamentals* of the story - that the Jews were slaves in Egypt and then were freed - was true.\n\nIf even that part is false - and it appears to be the case - then doesn't all of it just collapse?  Everything past Genesis becomes a story that can clearly be seen to be false based on contradictory contemporary historical evidence.  \n\nEven more so - what does this say about the relationship between Jews and Egyptians today?  When even modern day Jewish children are being taught that they were once enslaved by evil Egyptians!?!?\n\nAnd what does that say about the history of Jewish/Egyptian/Pan-Arabic relations when some fable may well have perpetuated a culture of mistrust and hatred based on historical inaccuracies?\n\nOr - in a more 'conspiracy theory' flavor - is it possible that there is some sort of 'holocaust denial' type of rewriting of history taking place  - perhaps to discredit any Jewish claims to settlement in the Middle East?\n\nAnd if the OT and Judaism collapses - doesn't the New Testament follow it down the tubes?\n\nI'm confused as to why the recent movie and the release of historical opinions that indicate that the exodus was a myth are not a much bigger thorn in theist's sides.",

I would assume very few because they just assume everyone is Christian and most end up like this when confronting the death of someone they know personally.  \n\nDo you think Christianity would be different if more people were honest with who they thought were and were not going to hell?\n\nEDIT 2:  After further reading, it appears she was indeed an atheist.  Also, the denial of evidence based therapy contributed to the depression.  Her parents would only allow her to see Christian therapists.",

(Rural Pennsylvania sure looks like fun.)\n\nAny time I see evolution discussed in a public sort of venue (as opposed to biologists doing their usual jobs), it's either a Christian (or, occasionally, some other sort of believer) attacking evolution, or an atheist defending it.\n\nWe're frequently reassured in here that most Christians accept evolution and that there's no conflict between them. And certainly the demographics of this particular sub reflect that. Creationists are few and far between here. Yet I never see Christian evolutionists actually defending evolution. That goes for this sub; when the occasional creationist makes an appearance, it's invariably him versus a bunch of atheists. It also goes for the wider world from what I see, where we see things like the Nye/Ham debates.\n\nWhy aren't Christians who accept evolution publicly correcting their wayward co-religionists? Does it happen and I just don't see it? Do they just not care about the issue? Is it something else entirely?",

To provide context for the discussion, I'm going to borrow /u/imurnumber1stfan's excellent definition of \"gnostic\" vs. \"agnostic\" in this context:\n\n&gt;-Agnosticism/Gnosticism: is a position on the nature of knowledge\n\n&gt;-Agnostic/Gnostic is an adjective that explains whether the following position is derived from your knowledge of the topic or lack there of.\n\nEssentially, gnostic atheists state that they know there isn't a god, whereas agnostic atheists state that they don't believe in a god, but can't definitively prove it. Most people tend to be agnostic atheists.\n\n**My question is:** Given that \"god\" is typically defined as an entity that created the universe, and therefore transcends human understanding and observation, is gnostic atheism a defensible position?\n\nIn my opinion, the answer is a pretty clear \"no.\" That we're discussing \"god\" has little to do with it. If I asked 100 theoretical physicists, \"Can you definitively deny the existence of *anything* outside our universe?\" I'm betting just about all of them would answer \"no\" as well. The question can be more broadly stated as \"given that something is, by it's nature, beyond human understanding, can a human understand it?\"\n\nTo be clear, setting up the debate in terms of god as a transcendent entity causes all sorts of other problems for the idea of an Abrhamic God.

        "text": "So here's the deal: I am a Christian and was reading an [article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/eric-metaxas-science-increasingly-makes-the-case-for-god-1419544568) from the WSJ that makes claims about science increasingly pointing towards God. I was struck by two thoughts. The first was how much it irks me when people use God when what they really mean is intelligent creator. The second was the thought I always have when talking with atheists about their beliefs, I understand not believing in God (YHWH, the Hebrew god), but to totally disregard the idea of an intelligent creator still seems far out to me (I understand the belief system that I'm starting from and how that plays into that thought as well.\n\nSo here is the question! Can someone be considered an \"atheist\" and still believe that there is an intelligent creator. Not Agnostic (I have my own issues with that term...) but actually believes there is an intelligent creator and rejects current religious thoughts. Is there a term I should be aware of that defines this?\n\nEDIT: First, WOW! Thank you guys for all the responses! After reading the responses, I have realized a lot of ambiguity in the terms I have used, which I originally thought were more clarifying. In particular the terms \"supreme-being\" \"god\" and \"intelligent creator\". Admittedly I am coming from a belief in one god, YHWH, so I imagine this is the starting point of this confusion because it is difficult for myself to move out of that mindset that when I am talking about god I am talking about YHWH, but it seems to be a common point of confusion among any conversation. So to clarify a little bit, when I say intelligent creator I am not insinuating that it is a being, entity, that is the source of moral truth. Merely something that designed and set the universe in motion. \n\nSecondly, I am well aware of who funds the WSJ and it is not a source I make a habit of visiting or trusting. It was merely a link that I thought would be an interesting, if not flawed, read. And it was. It led me to this question and a lot of really interesting conversations with you people!\n\nThirdly, because someone asked I explain my belief in a god here we go (Also from here on out when I use God I mean YHWH, and god I mean the general use for deity). I was raised Christian, automatic eyebrow raised for indoctrination, but spent most of my high school years as an agnostic theist (a term I now feel comfortable describing myself with thanks you you guys). I didn't understand how a god could base what happens to me on how I act and that didn't feel like the love I had been taught. My junior year of high school I met a man who essentially explained to me that God didn't love us based on what we do, but as a father. God loves us unconditionally and wants us to a live a life that is as fulfilling as we can possibly be. Similar to (most) fathers that allow their children to make mistakes, break their rules, and help them through those moments. These lifestyle commands are designed to show us how to life a fulfilled life. Since that moment I have tried to learn more about this God and drawn myself closer to him. I have experienced quiet moments of meditation where I believe God has spoken directly, audibly, to me and been a happier person. This being the mentality there are things a lot of Christians believe that I disagree with, LGBTQ relationships being an easy one to point out. I think they should be allowed to be married, I believe they can be Christians and I doubt God will condemn them to hell for it.\n\nThe accuracy of the world form a mathematical and physical sense, the universal laws that tie everything together and the odds of it all happening randomly makes the idea of there not being an intelligent creator far out to me. That combined with my belief in God, make it hard for me to understand a lack of belief on anything beyond an intellectual level, which is still difficult. Finally, I would like to say a word for theistic scientists, because most believe that God created the universe, learning more about means we learn more about God. I am hesitant to stop exploring something by simply saying well God made it that way. Being a theist makes me extremely curious and it's why I work in a psychology research lab.\n\nSorry for how long this was! Thanks for all your guys' input, and I look forward to reading more!",

        "text": "Hi everyone! Long time reader of this subreddit, although I just created a new account as my old one was tied to my real name. ;-)\n\nAnyway, I see a lot of posts about \"coming out\" as an atheist to family/friends/community etc. and I wanted to share my experience in the hopes that it lends some insight to people who are in a situation wondering \"how to do it.\" \n\nI was raised Christian (Eastern Orthodox) and was very happy with it; loved the music, the theology, and certainly the community. Nevertheless, I was asking questions at an early age (props to my parents for encouraging critical thinking—even about religion). I was also lucky that the priests in my community were very willing to hear the questions I had and respond compassionately rather than in a harshly dogmatic manner. Anyway, during college I learned more about science; I was especially stimulated by learning more in depth about evolution by natural selection. Over time, the \"need for an explanation\" was replaced by that deeper understanding of scientific processes, and I then went through the common period of \"Oh crap. What if there isn't a God???\" Really scary couple months, until I did more reading of atheist literature (here, among many other places)  and learned how meaning was not at all religion-dependent. So, over the course of a couple years, I turned into a well-adjusted (I like to think) atheist. \n\nIt was then that I started worrying about how to tell people. I had many friends OUTSIDE of the church community that I grew up in, so it wasn't like I was going to be without friends/community, but nevertheless I had many friends who were still very religious, and I didn't want to lose them or whatnot. In the end, really what I wanted to do was continue having the interesting conversations I had been having during my journey, and show people how being an atheist has actually made me a *better* more moral person—how I feel even more responsible for my actions and my place in the world, now that I live without religion. So, I decided not to \"come out\". I just kept having the discussions, asking questions, and talking with people (like I always had). When they would ask me where I was religiously, I would tell them that I am convinced that there is no God—I was an atheist. That way, it simply came out organically with various people (including my family). What I found happened was that they were able to talk all this stuff with me, see how I am happy and content and loving of the world, and then when they found out (or many of them have simply inferred or heard) that I was an atheist, they were more interested in how it was possible to be happy and loving without god rather than simply anathematizing me and banishing me from their lives. I like to think that I have had a more positive effect on the religious people in my life that way, as they see (and are good friends with) an atheist who is a good person, and are more open-minded about atheism because of it. If I ever did some big \"coming out\" early on, I expect that some of them might have stopped being interested in having any discussions with me about religion and morality—simply dismissing me. So, in my case *not* \"coming out\"—but still being honest and open to telling people that I am an atheist—worked quite well and meant that I have burned almost no bridges in the process. And lots of the people I still have deep and interesting religious debates and discussions with!\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my positive experience of deciding not have a big coming out moment but rather just being honest about it when it comes up. Obviously it is not an option for all people, depending on the community and family they come from, but wanted to make sure people know that it is an option and has been great for me over the course of the past few years since becoming an atheist!\n\nTL;DR: In my case, I never \"came out\". I'm simply honest when people ask or it comes up in discussion (so I'm not hiding it or anything), and I've found more conversational doors stay open that way for talking about it. \n",

        "text": "So, I've been having a debate on /r/DebateAnAtheist about this, so please read carefully, and please share your thoughts. Here are my definitions (wikipedia derived):\n\n&gt; **Science** (from Latin scientia, meaning \"knowledge\") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature and the universe.\n\n&gt; A **scientist**, in a broad sense, is one engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge. In a more restricted sense, a scientist may refer to an individual who uses the scientific method. The person may be an expert in one or more areas of science.\n\n&gt; In psychology, **cognitive dissonance** is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.\n\nSo then there are some points of note:\n\n* Science, by definition, is an enterprise consisting of rules which must be followed in order to reach scientific answers.\n* Scientists are people who use the scientific method\n* Science does not make any demands on scientists themselves, other than following rules *while doing science*\n* The definition for a scientist does not state that a scientist must constantly engage in scientific activity, or use scientific methodology in all aspects of their life.\n\nSo here's the opinion I keep seeing:\n\n&gt;'scientists who are religious have cognitive dissonance because they deliberately don't apply the scientific methodology to their beliefs'\n\nNot all of you may hold that belief, but some of you may. Here's my argument:\n\n&gt; Unless you believe that you should apply scientific methodology to all aspects of your life, *it is not cognitive dissonance to not do so*. No part of science (by the definitions given) tells you to do so. \n\n\nIf you believe that you should apply science to all parts of your life, that is due to *your* philosophy, not science. Some people may consider science as a way of viewing the universe - but that's not what it is defined as: it's a toolkit for answering the questions *you* want answered. It's fine to use it for everything if you like - but that is not a requirement of science. It's a requirement of your beliefs. \n\nAs far as I can see, these two are equivalent:\n\n* A naturalistic person says cognitive dissonance for not applying science to my faith \n\n* A priest says blasphemy when you take the Lord's name in vain\n\nWhy should you care? Why should I? I never signed anything saying 'yes, I agree I will use science in all aspects of my life'. Why should I be held to account for a belief system like naturalism or evidentialism that I simply don't subscribe to?\n\nTL;DR Cognitive dissonance only occurs if you believe that you believe everything should/can be tested with science. I don't.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to say - I'm a PhD student, hence the 'in-training'",

Those that have escaped religion know this too well.\n\nPutting pride aside, what could you be wrong about?\n\n\n",

All according to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, of course.\n\nWith a cast led by Peter Serafinowicz (Crowley) and Mark Heap (Aziraphale) this is the first ever dramatization of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's Good Omens.\n\nEnjoy! http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04knthd\n\nEDIT: We're in a discussion thread, so yeah, discussion.\n\nDo you think christians near you, or have you met any christians, who would be offended by this work? \n\nI ask because I grew up with Life of Brian, Terry Pratchett, Philip Pullman, Douglas Adams and Isaac Asimov. There were lots of atheistic voices and opinions. You really have to really push me in order to offend me; the idea that religion may be wrong and stupid is not a new or offensive idea to me, because I believe that all ideas should be challenged. It is also a part of maturing to be able to be offended without requiring that anyone has to apologise for your hurt feelings - if I am offended, it is my problem, and mine alone. I think being offended once in a while is quite healthy. Also, I think life is fundamentally ridiculous, so I like to laugh at it ;) \n\nSo, do you think this work is offensive? Do you think people would be offended by it? What do you think should be the correct response to work that challenges your beliefs or makes fun of it? ",

Or the stuff about cities and dates of certain events.\n\nI argue that it can't be trusted to have relayed anything accurately since it treats all of its own obviously false and/or contradictory information as fact along with the historical bits. And because of that, one would have to compare the bible against another trusted source to prove that the historical parts are accurate anyway, thus making it useless as a primary source.  \n\nSo how reliable is it? Is it, as they say, \"widely considered\" by most historians to be a good source? Is it just... the only source? Is that better than nothing?",

        "text": "Have you ever heard of such people?  If so, what would be your reasons for such people doing so?\n\nOne of the reasons for an atheist preaching religion is that he/she does not like being an atheist and wishes to no longer be an atheist.  Therefore, he/she instead now preaches religion, how great religion is, and how much atheism sucks.  Same thing goes for a religious person preaching atheism in that this person does not like being religious who no longer wishes to be religious.\n\nSo why is it that one would detest being an atheist even though they are now free to live how they want and are not bound by any religious belief?  One of the reasons would be that this person values living a life of full pleasure with as little suffering as possible.  This person values living such a life above all else.  Maybe perhaps because he/she is a hedonist who values a life of much pleasure as possible with as little suffering as possible for his/herself as well as for others.  This person would think that since he/she has just as much personal value as any other good person, that a life of utter bliss with no suffering would be the greatest thing not only for him/her, but also for other people he/she cares about.  Since he/she has just as much personal good value as any other good person, he/she would think that he/she has just as much right to seek pleasure for his/herself as well as to give pleasure to those other people.   \n\nNow as I said before, this hedonist values a life of eternal pleasure of no suffering above all else not only for his/herself, but for those other people he/she cares about. Therefore, since a religious belief (such as Christianity) offers an afterlife of eternal joy free of suffering, then this person values this life above all else even regardless of the fact that this person would not be free to live as he/she so desires since he/she would be bound by his/her christian religious belief and the morals in that religious belief.  This person has no value whatsoever in living a life that consists of suffering and striving forward in life in despite of that suffering.  Instead, he/she has full value towards growing as a person and striving and moving forward in life through pure pleasure alone with no suffering instead since not only would this be the greatest life for him/her, but also because you can strive, do great things in life, help others, and grow as a person just as good as (and even better) than if you did through your suffering.  You can achieve this through living such a blissful life under the right circumstances.  Therefore, this also applies to even the greatest people in history and they could of been just as great and even greater if they lived blissful lives through instead changing their attitudes, changing their actions, changing their lives, and through other things besides suffering since suffering would, therefore, be completely pointless and unnecessary.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to hear your opinion on the attitude of this particular person who I am going to present below in quotes.  This is a person (a hedonist and an atheist) who has lived a life of much suffering and a life of little to no pleasure (a life of anhedonia which is a mental condition in which you have a chronic absence of pleasure):\n\n\"So, I can never live a life of full pleasure with no suffering since life will always be about suffering and accepting your suffering/lack of pleasure in life since this life can never be perfect?  And neither is there a promised afterlife of eternal pleasure of no suffering as a reward for all my pointless suffering and lack of pleasure here on Earth?  If that is the case, then I say whelp, that's it for me then.  I'm out.  Goodbye.  I could care less about this bullshit of a life that not only doesn't give me the life of pleasure of very little to no suffering that I want, but this bullshit of a life also doesn't give me a promised afterlife of eternal pleasure of no suffering either.\"\n\nNow that I have presented that quoted person, what is your opinion about his/her attitude here as being both an atheist and a hedonist who wishes to opt out of this life who has committed suicide?  This person can NEVER and REFUSES to ever change his/her hedonistic and atheistic attitude as well.  Therefore, what is your opinion in regards to this person as well as everything else I said here?  I would like to hear yours and anyone else's opinions.\n\nOne very important thing I would like to add is that this particular person in that quoted message is an attitude I have and I am a hedonist and an atheist who suffers from anhedonia as well as depression.  Also, my anhedonia was not caused by me feeling indifferent or anything like that due to me being an atheist who finds no value in living a life that consists of suffering and no full pleasure.  Rather, my severe chronic anhedonia was caused by some other stressful life event.\n\n",

I personally have not had any experience with a psychic (self proclaimed or otherwise), but I have met several Christians who claim to be \"spirituality sensitive\".  One teacher I had would look at people and would then proceed to tell them something about themselves.  For example, I attended a nondenominational Christan school and there was 1 catholic guy that went there.  She told him that the reason he constantly wanted to talk about the Catholic faith was because he felt threatened, being the only catholic in the school and that he wanted to cover his own doubts.  She could only do this if she sort of knew the person....Others simply claim to be able to tell where people are in their faith and how sencere they are and they attribute it to God.  In my experience, the person has no spiritual sensitivity.  They are being logical in the way they fit what they know together.  More or less being deductive reasoning.  Then when other see them being right, they back them up.  In these cases, the person backing their claim wouldn't have known what kind of information the sensitive person was given or was able to pick up behind the scenes.  Thoughts?",

I asked myself a very important question, one I think every believer should do themselves,\"why do I believe?\" and I couldn't come up with a single answer as to why. Realizing this, I came to the conclusion it wasn't so much that I believed, as much as it was that I believed in belief.

        "text": "I'd be willing to bet this has been posted before, somewhere; but I always found this funny/insightful. It'll also continue to be highly relevant, as critical Biblical knowledge becomes more and more mainstream, and (for example) Christians are forced to resort to figurative interpretation of problematic Biblical passages/stories in order to defend the notion of its truly divine inspiration. \n\nAnyways, this is taken from the footnotes (p. 296-97) of Harris' *The End of Faith*:\n\n&gt;No doubt, many students of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish esoterica will claim that my literal reading of their scriptures betrays my ignorance of their spiritual import. To be sure, occult, alchemical, and conventionally mystical interpretations in the Bible and the [Qur'an] are as old as the texts themselves, but the problem with such hermeneutical efforts . . . is that they are unrestrained by the contents of the texts themselves. One can interpret every text in such a way as to yield almost any mystical or occult instruction. \n\n&gt;A case in point: I have selected another book at random, this time from the cookbook aisle of a bookstore. The book is *A Taste of Hawaii: New Cooking from the Crossroads of the Pacific*. Therein I have discovered an as yet uncelebrated mystical treatise. While it appears to be a recipe for *wok-seared fish and shrimp cakes with ogo-tomato relish*, we need only study its list of ingredients to know that we are in the presence of an unrivaled spiritual intelligence:\n\n&gt;snapper filet, cubed\n\n&gt;3 teaspoons chopped scallions\n\n&gt;salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n&gt;a dash of cayenne pepper\n\n&gt;2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger\n\n&gt;1 teaspoon minced garlic\n\n&gt;8 shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cubed\n\n&gt;1/2 cup heavy cream; 2 eggs, lightly beaten\n\n&gt;3 teaspoons rice wine; 2 cups bread crumbs\n\n&gt;3 tablespoons vegetable oil; 2 1/2 cups ogo tomato relish\n\n&gt;The *snapper filet*, of course, is the individual himself -- you and I -- awash in the sea of existence. But here we find it cubed, which is to say that our situation must be remedied in all three dimensions of body, mind, and spirit.\n\n&gt;*Three teaspoons of chopped scallions* further partakes of the cubic symmetry, suggesting that that which we need add to each level of our being by way of antidote comes likewise in equal proportions. The import of the passage is clear: the body, mind, and spirit need to be tended to with the same care.\n\n&gt;*Salt and freshly ground black pepper*: here we have the perennial invocation of opposites -- the white and the black aspects of our nature. Both good and evil must be understood if we would fulfill the recipe for spiritual life. Nothing, after all, can be excluded from the human experience (this seems to be a Tantric text). What is more, salt and pepper come to us in the form of grains, which is to say that our good and bad qualities are born of the tiniest actions. Thus, we are not good or evil in general, but only by virtue of innumerable moments, which color the stream of our being by force of repetition.\n\n&gt;A *dash of cayenne pepper*: clearly, being of such robust color and flavor, this signifies the spiritual influence of an enlightened adept. What shall we make of the ambiguity of its measurement? How large is a dash? Here we must rely upon the wisdom of the universe at large. The teacher himself will know precisely what we need by way of instruction. And it is at just this point in the text that the ingredients that bespeak the heat of spiritual endeavor are added to the list -- for after a dash of cayenne pepper, we find *two teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger and one teaspoon of minced garlic*. These form an isosceles trinity of sorts, signifying the two sides of our spiritual nature (male and female) united with the object meditation.\n\n&gt;Next comes *eight shrimp -- peeled, deveined, and cubed*. The eight shrimp, of course, represent the eight worldly concerns that every spiritual aspirant must decry: fame and shame; loss and gain; pleasure and pain; praise and blame. Each needs to be deveined, peeled, and cubed -- that is, purged of its power to entrance us and incorporated on the path of practice.\n\n_____\n\nWe should always be conscious of the origins of figurative interpretation / allegoresis in *apologetic*. \n\nKathryn A. Morgan (*Myth and Philosophy from the Presocratics to Plato*) had forcefully argued that \"Any allegorical or symbolic treatment, whether its aim is to defend or to appropriate, is subsequent to the critique of myth and language.\" (For more on this and a response, cf. Gerard Naddaf, \"Allegory and the Origins of Philosophy.\")\n\nFigurative interpretation seems to have first emerged from attempts to excuse the bad behavior of the gods (and others) by reinterpreting their actions as non-literal: as metaphor for various natural phenomena, etc. This was actually first undertaken in Greek religion, before these methods were adopted by Jews/Christians. Already in the 3rd century CE, Porphyry (and/or a scholiast) relates the emergence of figurative readings:\n\n&gt;Homer's doctrine on the gods usually tends to be useless and improper, for the myths he relates about the gods are offensive. In order to counter this sort of accusation, some people invoke the mode of expression (*tēs lexeōs*); they feel that all was said in an allegorical mode (*allēgoria*) and has to do with the nature of the elements, for instance, as in the case of conflict between the gods. . . . This kind of defense is very ancient and goes back to Theagenes of Rhegium, who was the first to write about Homer.\n\nThe precariousness and arbitrary nature of this approach was certainly recognized in antiquity, too. For example, the Christian arch-allegorist [Origen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen) writes, of his opponent Celsus, that\n\n&gt;πάνυ ἁπλούστατα νομίζει εἶναι καὶ ἰδιωτικὰ ὁ Κέλσος τὰ Ἰουδαίων καὶ Χριστιανῶν βιβλία καὶ οἴεται **τοὺς ἀλληγοροῦντας αὐτὰ βιαζομένους τὸ βούλημα τῶν γραψάντων τοῦτο ποιεῖν**.\n\n&gt;Celsus thinks the books of Jews and Christians are utterly crude and illiterate, and supposes that *those who allegorize them force the meaning of the authors in so doing*\n\nElsewhere (4.49-50):\n\nIf Celsus had read the Bible impartially, he would not have said that our writings *are incapable of being interpreted allegorically* [Εἰ δ' ἀδεκάστως ἀνεγνώκει τὴν γραφὴν ὁ Κέλσος, οὐκ ἂν εἶπεν οὐχ οἷα ἀλληγορίαν ἐπιδέχεσθαι εἶναι τὰ γράμματα ἡμῶν]. . . . I have ventured upon an extended discussion from a desire to show that Celsus is incorrect when he says that *the more reasonable Jews and Christians try somehow to allegorize them, but they are incapable of being explained in this way, and are manifestly very stupid fables* [Ἐπὶ πλεῖον δ' ἐξέτεινα τὸν λόγον βουλόμενος παραστῆσαι μὴ ὑγιῶς εἰρῆσθαι τῷ Κέλσῳ ὅτι οἱ ἐπιεικέστεροι Ἰουδαίων καὶ Χριστιανῶν πειρῶνταί πως ἀλληγορεῖν αὐτά, ἔστι δ' οὐχ οἷα ἀλληγορίαν ἐπιδέχεσθαί τινα ἀλλ' ἄντικρυς εὐηθέστατα μεμυθολόγηται.]. But the truth is much rather that it is the legends of the Greeks which are not only *very stupid* but also very impious [Πολλῷ γὰρ μᾶλλον τὰ Ἑλλήνων οὐ μόνον εὐηθέστατα ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀσεβέστατα μεμυθολόγηται.]. For our scriptures have been written to suit exactly the multitude of the simple-minded, a consideration to which no attention was paid by those who made up the fictitious stories of the Greeks.\n\n(Cf. Tatian: \"Metrodorus of Lampsacus, in his treatise *About Homer*, reasoning very foolishly, turns everything into allegory\" [David J. Califf, \"Metrodorus of Lampsacus and the Problem of Allegory: An Extreme Case?\"]. For more see John Granger Cook, \"[Porphyry's Attempted Demolition of Christian Allegory](https://www.academia.edu/3339675/Porphyrys_Attempted_Demolition_of_Christian_Allegory).\")\n\nEusebius quotes Porphyry:\n\n&gt;τῆς δὴ μοχθηρίας τῶν Ἰουδαϊκῶν γραφῶν οὐκ ἀπόστασιν, λύσιν δέ τινες εὑρεῖν προθυμηθέντες, ἐπ̓ ἐξηγήσεις ἐτράποντο ἀσυγκλώστους καὶ ἀναρμόστους τοῖς γεγραμμένοις, οὐκ ἀπολογίαν μᾶλλον ὑπὲρ τῶν ὀθνείων, παραδοχὴν δὲ καὶ ἔπαινον τοῖς οἰκείοις φερούσας. αἰνίγματα γὰρ τὰ φανερῶς παρὰ Μωυσεῖ λεγόμενα εἶναι κομπάσαντες καὶ ἐπιθειάσαντες ὡς θεσπίσματα πλήρη κρυφίων μυστηρίων διά τε τοῦ τύφου τὸ κριτικὸν τῆς ψυχῆς καταγοητεύσαντες, ἐπάγουσιν ἐξηγήσεις\n\n&gt;Some who are eager not for an abandonment of the depravity of the Jewish scriptures, but who seek a solution [for it] have been driven to interpretations that are not compatible with or harmonize with what has been written—not producing an apology for the alien texts but rather acceptance and praise for the writings of their own group. For they boast that the things that are said clearly by Moses are enigmas, and they ascribe inspiration to those sayings as if they were oracles full of hidden mysteries. Bewitching the mind’s critical faculty through nonsense, they bring forward interpretations.\n\nAlso,\n\n&gt;The prefatory letter to Anatolius which introduces Porphyry's Homeric Questions begins with a statement of principle: 'Frequently in our conversations with one another, Anatolius, questions concerning Homer arise, and while I try to show that although he regularly provides the explanation of his own verses, we, because of our childhood instruction, **read into him** rather than reflect upon what he is saying (περινοοῦμεν μᾶλλον ἐν τοῖς πλείστοις ἢ νοοῦμεν ἃ λέγει)'\n\n___\n\nFord notes\n\n&gt;Plutarch observed that what was called *allēgoria* in his day had formerly been called *huponoia*, “under-meaning” (*Moralia* 19E). This word can help us recover something of allegorical exegesis in the classical period. \n\n. . . \n\n&gt;As subtle as Homeric poetry may appear to modern readers, it was not generally taken by the ancients as a cryptic text. Xenophanes, for example, objects not to any hidden implications in Homeric poetry but to the literal content of its stories. In this case, for an allegorizing critic to say that the epic poet “riddles” (*ainittetai*) this or that was to reposition narrative epic and assign it to another form of discourse. Early epic allegorists did not concoct a new method for reading Homer but rather transferred epic to an already established class of speech with its own special rules for speaking and decoding.\n\nFurther,\n\n&gt;A different critique of allegoresis is offered to a young man past primary schooling when Socrates faults allegoresis because it does not result in certain interpretations (*Phaedrus* 229E–230A). However, this is not a problem with allegoresis in particular: Plato’s Socrates argues on several occasions that no form of poetic exegesis can get around the fact that the texts of old poets can be construed in various ways and, unless one has the poets at hand to cross-question, one cannot be certain that the meaning construed from a text is what the poet “meant.”The Socrates of the Phaedrus shows himself able to use allegoresis to reinterpret a story about divine impropriety but in the end turns away from the method for a different, social reason. In answer to Phaedrus’ question whether he truly believes the story (*muthologēma*) about Boreas’ rape of Oreithyia, Socrates is prepared to give a rationalizing (*sophizomenoi*) account of it in naturalistic terms. Like any sophisticated reasoner (*sophizomenos*), he is willing to dispense with a literal meaning of a myth (*Phaedrus* 229C–E) and suggest that a blast of wind pushed a girl off a cliff, but people ended up saying that she was “snatched up” or “raped” (*anarpaston*) by Boreas. Socrates then delivers a verdict on such wisdom: “I consider such things elegant and amusing (*kharienta*), but an occupation suited for someone who is formidably clever (*deinos*) and painstaking (*epiponos*) and not altogether enviable” (229D). Socrates finally objects to the professionalization of the practice and to its use as a source of amusement and show of brilliance rather than as part of a philosophical search for ethical truth.\n\n. . .\n\n&gt;Socrates rejects the Heraclitean worldview, but allows that poets of the good old days used allegory to hide cosmic truths from the masses: “The ancients concealed their meaning from the many (*polloi*) with poetry, but the moderns, being ’wiser,’ spell out everything in their public performances (ἀναφαδνὸν [sic: ἀναφανδὸν] ἀποδεικνυμένων) so that even cobblers can hear and become wise and lose cease from their beliefs.”\n\n____\n\nDio Chrysostom (*Discourses* 53):\n\n&gt;ὁ δὲ Ζήνων οὐδὲν τῶν τοῦ Ὁμήρου ψέγει,1 ἅμα2 διηγούμενος καὶ διδάσκων ὅτι τὰ μὲν κατὰ δόξαν, τὰ δὲ κατὰ ἀλήθειαν γέγραφεν, ὅπως μὴ φαίνηται αὐτὸς αὑτῷ μαχόμενος ἔν τισι δοκοῦσιν ἐναντίως εἰρῆσθαι. ὁ δὲ λόγος οὗτος Ἀντισθένους ἐστὶ πρότερον, ὅτι τὰ μὲν δόξῃ, τὰ δὲ ἀληθείᾳ εἴρηται τῷ ποιητῇ· ἀλλ᾿ ὁ μὲν οὐκ ἐξειργάσατο αὐτόν, ὁ δὲ καθ᾿ ἕκαστον τῶν ἐπὶ μέρους ἐδήλωσεν.\n\n&gt;Zeno finds fault with none of the work of Homer, undertaking to interpret it and at the same time to show that the poet has written some things in accord with fancy and some things in accord with reality, Zeno’s purpose being to save Homer from appearing to be at war with himself in certain matters which are held to be inconsistent with each other as narrated by Homer.1 But Antisthenes2 anticipated Zeno in this theory, namely, that some things have been spoken by the poet in accord with fancy and some in accord with reality; however, Antisthenes did not elaborate the theory, whereas Zeno made it plain in each of its details.\n\nGlenn Most (\"Hellenistic allegory and Early Imperial Rhetoric\"): \"our sources report some of [Cleanthes'] attempts to import Stoic doctrines into the poems of Homer and Euripides by means of bizarre textual conjectures (SVF 1.535, 549, 562),\" and \"Cicero's *On the Nature of the Gods* and Philodemus' *On Piety* demonstrate how easily the Stoics' allegory could become a target for nasty polemics on the part of their Academic and Epicurean rivals, who had no trouble making fun of Stoic claims for allegorical meanings in ancient poems and cult practices.\"\n\n&gt;As spokesman for the multitude [Homer] may contradict the truths he knew and expressed elsewhere. But this contradiction is only apparent, for in this case it is not Homer who is wrong but the multitude whose views he is expressing.' Diogenianus criticises Chrysippus for his selective quotations from Homer, which obscure the fact that Homer does not consistently support Chrysippus' doctrine that everything is fated; cf. the citation of Diogenianus by Eusebius, *Praep. evang*. VI.8.1-7.\n\n___\n\n(Nevertheless, Origen -- along with Augustine -- couldn't bring their figurative interpretation so far as to deny a historical Adam and Eve and [young earth and ark of Noah](http://www.reddit.com/r/bad_religion/comments/2psvu8/meta_question_is_this_sub_only_for_instances/cn0m50t), etc.: on which subjects they didn't depart from literal readings.)\n\nThe preeminent church father Jerome uses figurative interpretation in defense of expounding the evils of wine/intoxication, and to suggest that no one in the Bible was really ever drinking (real) wine, but only \"spiritual wine\" -- that is Christ (cf. *Homily* 42).\n\nFinally, in good Hellenistic fashion, Augustine (incredibly) excuses all \"apparent\" bad behavior in the Bible -- whether from God himself or men -- by this interpretive principle:\n\n&gt;anything in the [scriptures] that cannot be related either to good morals or to the true faith should be taken as figurative. . . . Jeremiah's phrase \"Behold today I have established you over nations and kingdoms, to uproot and destroy, to lay waste and scatter\" is, without doubt, entirely figurative, and so must be related to the aim that I mentioned above. **Matters which seem like wickedness to the unenlightened, whether just spoken or actually performed, whether attributed to God or to people whose holiness is commended to us, are entirely figurative.** (*De Doctrina Christiana* 3.33, 41-42)",

The cosmological argument, sometimes referred to as the prime mover argument, asserts that some divine force must have set events in motion that led to the creation of the universe.  \n\nOne of the most common objections to atheism is that atheists claim to hold special knowledge that there is no god behind the universe's creation.  What needs to be pointed out is the cosmological argument leaves believers no better off than it does atheists and in fact serves as a concession of defeat. \n\nWhere atheists generally say there has been no demonstrable evidence for the existence of a god, believers generally make the opposite but equally valid claim to knowledge of the opposite.  The thing is that theists also saddle their claim to knowledge with a whole plethora of very specific sometimes falsifiable claims to knowledge.  Their burden isn't to demonstrate the existence of a deity.  It goes much further than that.  Their burden it to demonstrate every claim that their particular religion makes. \n\ntdlr:  In a conversation with theists, even if you allow believers to claim that atheism is a claim to knowledge (which I do not), theists remain at a disadvantage because of all the other spurious shit that they need to show.  \n\nPost script:  I've also got to add that I'm sick of seeing stereotypical comments that start out with \"i am a youth minister who lurks but\" and end with \"why are you accepting the fact that empirical evidence is the only form of proof\" being up voted to the extent that they have in here lately.

If all they do is fight the sane, rational fights that most people agree with, very few if anyone cares. \n\nBut if they fight for some minor, obscure, and **controversial** bit of atheist sentiment, it's FAR more likely to get everyone talking about atheism and the separation of church and state... even if most of those people are calling atheists nasty names.\n\nI've long since wanted to see a real change in how the American Atheists are run, and hoped a change of leadership would help.  But now I don't know if that's true anymore.\n\nIf the cost of doing business in the world we live in is drumming up controversy, if that's the only way to really draw attention to important issues that otherwise would be swept under the rug, then do you think the American Atheists are doing a good job? Or is it one that ultimately isn't worth the price?",

Last year, I went through a period of severe depression. It was so bad I couldn’t keep up with my course work. There were some days where I just couldn’t see myself through to getting out of bed. It culminated with me ending up in the hospital under suicide watch in the spring semester. I had to drop my classes after I accepted federal student aid. This caused a shit storm in my financial aid life. I have been a part time student this semester and will attempt to take a half or full time load next semester hoping to finish by the end of summer.\n\nHowever, because I was only part time, one of my student loan companies started calling in their debt today. I tried to tell them that I would have more hours next semester and asked to defer the payments as I thought I could. They informed me that once I regain at least half time status I can fax them a form and my payments would be deferred, but today I had to pay. So, I begrudgingly shelled out most of my bank account just wanting it to be over.\n\nThen I realized something; As a Christian I would have thought, “thank God they asked for money when I had enough to pay them” or “thank God for giving me a job with which to pay them.” I would have not given myself the credit for getting a job and having saved enough to pay them. I realized that I could finally start to take credit for my own actions. I used to believe that if I took credit for the good in my life I was being selfish. I obviously have friends and family whom I can thank for support and guidance, but I made the choices. I don’t have to give the credit to a god for overseeing the process. Fuck that noise. I’m the one who took 100 credit hours of physics and math courses in 4 years, which lead me to my job, which lead me to being able to pay a student loan bill, god didn’t do that. ←probably a run-on sentence. I am sorry.\n\nThis is a big deal to a person with depression. To be able to credit yourself with something you were able to do. Self-esteem has always been a huge problem for me, but now I see this as an opportunity to help. If I can give myself credit for the things I accomplish, maybe I’ll start to feel better about myself and life in general.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?",

        "author": "TotallyNotJohnCena",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2pn8yj/questions_for_atheists/",
        "text": "I know you guys are probably really sick of these kinds of threads, so sorry about making another one, but sometimes it’s hard to find out information about something without ever being able to ask people questions and have discussions, and my options for speaking with atheists is really limited. I have a ton of questions I’d like to ask, but I’ll try (and probably fail) to be as brief as possible because I know people make threads like this here a lot.\n\nMy whole childhood was really sheltered. I was homeschooled, I went to church at least three times a week, and pretty much everyone I knew was someone who went to church with me or my parents. Christianity has always been the center of my and everyone around me’s lives, and I was never really exposed to any other kinds of viewpoints. Now that I’m just about an adult, I’m finding that I don’t know nearly as much about the world as I thought, and there are ton of different religions and philosophies other people live by that I have no experience with. I’d like to learn as much about all these different points of view as I can.\n\nAtheism was one of the strangest one of those to me. My religion is the core of my life, and while I’m finding other religions strange too, I can still sort of understand them as religions, like those are what people have in place of what I have. But atheists don’t have any religion at all. They don’t just not care or not like religion (though a lot of them don’t seem to like religion), they literally have no belief whatsoever in any kind of spirituality. And that’s really crazy to me, totally alien and foreign to my way of life. So I’ve been spending a lot of time recently reading through subs like this one, and reading and watching things on the internet to try and understand how and why atheists believe and think what they do. I do think I have a pretty good grasp on atheism, but there are also still a lot of things I don’t understand that I can’t find satisfying answers to. So I made an account just so I could ask these.\n\nAnyway, sorry for all that text. I really wanted to try and explain why I’m asking questions because I know there’s a stigma that religious people come to the sub and make threads like this just because they’re trying to preach at people and not because they are actually looking for information, which isn’t what I’m doing at all. I’m genuinely looking for information.\n\n1. Why do atheists insist on being called atheists? \n\nEdit: I think this one has been pretty well answered. Thanks to people who answered! Anyone else, feel free to skip right over this one, because I think I understand the answer well enough, and it was kind of a dumb question to begin with.\n\nI know this one is kind of dumb, because labels don’t really matter. What you call yourself doesn’t have much of an effect on what you actually are. But I’ve noticed a trend that atheists seem be really hesitant to allow themselves to be labeled as agnostics, even when that label seems more appropriate. I know the most popular definition of atheism now is ‘lack of belief in God’ instead of ‘active disbelief in God’ and I also know that a lot of atheists dislike the idea of agnosticism as being a kind of middle ground (and I’m not sure I understand why that is either).\n\nBut the classic definitions of atheist and agnostic, and as far as I know the official definitions of the terms, are still ‘active disbelief in God’ and ‘believes existence of God cannot be known.’ From what I’ve seen, most people here don’t actively disbelief in God and accept that the most honest answer is that the existence of God really can’t be known for any kind of certainty. And yet you still insist on being called atheists instead of agnostics. Why? I know it isn’t very important, but it seems strange. Why redefine the terms when there’s already a term (and one with less stigma attached to it) that effectively describes your beliefs?\n\n2. What if you’re wrong?\n\nI know this is a question atheists get a lot, Pascal’s wager and etc. I know the usual atheist response, too, that it applies as much to religious people as atheists, because there’s a lot of religions and any of them could potentially be wrong or right, which I don’t deny. But, well, that doesn’t really answer the question. Doesn’t it worry you at all that you may be getting this wrong? Especially with the consequences that being wrong come with in this situation? \n\nPersonally, as someone on the other side of the discussion, yes, I’m willing to admit that I am. I don’t think I’d be doing this if I weren’t. I wouldn’t have any need to research other beliefs if I knew for certain mine were the only possible correct ones. It’s hard for me to look at the millions of people who believe in Islam or Hinduism, and even the however many people who are atheists, and just flippantly say, ‘I guess they’re all mistaken/misinformed/crazy.’ (which is why I’d like to know more about other beliefs, so I can examine their claims for myself) So why do atheists seem able to do that with Christianity (or other religions)? Are you really not worried at all? Where does this confidence in your lack of belief come from?\n\n3. What about all the very intelligent people who do and have believed in God?\n\nThis, as I’ve learned from reading these subs, is a fallacy called ‘appeal to authority.’ It’s a bad argument because smart people can believe in all sorts of stupid things, and just because smart people believed in them, doesn’t make them true. All of which I totally accept. But I’m not trying to make an argument, just understand other people’s viewpoints. I’m not trying to convince you to believe in God because all those other people believe in God. I just want to know: What do you think of all the religious scientists in history? \n\nA lot of atheists seems to think Christians are only Christians because they are blindly following what they are told? But do you really believe people as intelligent as Isaac Newton never examined their own faith? Do you really think he never considered the possibility that no God existed? \n\nI’ll admit, I’m not very intelligent. When someone who is very intelligent believes something, while I do agree that I should not immediately accept that belief at face value just because someone intelligent tells me to, I am definitely more inclined to believe that, especially someone so intelligent that they revolutionized physics and mathematics. Isaac Newton didn’t believe in Christianity as most people would think of it, but he was still absolutely certain that a God existed, and there are thousands of other examples of very intelligent in history who believed the same. So, can you really just say, ‘well, they were all wrong. I’m more intelligent than them and I know better’? (Edit: Sorry, I didn't mean this to sound as arrogant as it ended up being, I'm not very good at formal discussion. I swear I'm not trying to be insulting) To be clear, I accept that this applies as much to other religions as Christianity. I don’t doubt that very intelligent people have believed other religions, which is why i think studying those other religions is worthwhile.\n\n4. Do you really think Christianity has done nothing good for the world? That it can do no good in the world? \n\nAnd that it’s not worth keeping around if only so that it can continue to facilitate doing good?\nIt seems like a lot of atheists either wish that everyone else would become atheists or that religion would have never existed at all, and that the world would be better then. I just… I’m really skeptical of this. I know atheists don’t put a lot of stock in personal, undocumented claims, but for me Christianity has never been anything but a positive influence in my life. It helps keep me honest, pushes me towards helping others and gives me opportunities to do volunteer and charity work in my town, and belief in Christ has helped me through a lot of hard times. It’s really hard to think that I could have gotten through the bad experiences that I have or that I would make as much of an effort to always do the right thing if it weren’t for my beliefs. \n\nI know the typical response is that if you only do good things to get a reward or only do good because God tells you to, you were never actually a good person. But, well, I’m trying to do good, and a lot of that is because of Christianity. Maybe secretly down inside I am a bad person, but I’m still doing my best to do good, and that’s what counts, right? And it is Christianity that is pushing me towards doing that. With that, how can you say that Christianity does no good in the world? (I also know that a lot of very bad things have been done in the name of Christianity, but do those make all the good things done in the name of Christianity meaningless?)\n\nI know the other typical response is that you don’t need religion to do good things, which is absolutely true. But that seems to me kind of like, if I said, the Beatles did a lot of good things for music and for the development of the modern studio album, and then you said, ‘Yeah, well, we didn’t need the Beatles to make those developments, we could have done them anyway.’ Which is also probably true. But just because we could have made those advancements without the Beatles doesn’t deprive the Beatles of their accomplishments, and just because you can do good without religion doesn’t deprive religion of the good that it has done. And organized religion provides the framework and incentive for doing good, where otherwise it might not be. For example, I could go to my church and ask everyone, ‘Hey, I’d like to gather money for X cause, can you help out?’ and I’m certain I’d get a lot of support, because my church does things like that all the time. But if I didn’t have my church and I wanted to help that same cause, I wouldn’t even know where to start. \n\nI’m getting into areas I’m admittedly not very familiar with, but religion seems to have done a lot of good in western history. Like, you can never untwist religion and music or art. A lot of great works of art use religious subjects or were commissioned by religious organizations, like The Last Supper or the Sistine Chapel. Or back when monasteries were one of the few literate institutions in Europe that worked to maintain and reprint historical information and documents that might have been forever lost otherwise. And Christianity hasn’t done any good for the world at all?\n\nI’ll stop here, because I’ve already typed way more than I intended to. I guess I suck at being brief. Sorry for writing so much, and thank you very much to anyone who bothered to read all the way through. Even if you don’t respond, I do appreciate that you lent me your time.\n",

        "text": "I'm not usually one to post much online, whether it's Facebook, Reddit or whatever so I guess this is a bit of a big deal for me. Congratulations guys you've temporarily broken lurker habits. But other than breaking my usual passive online nature I'm here to try get some advice from you anonymous stranger. I need a place to start looking into the world and beliefs of atheists. I know this is probably a bit selfish and I'm not sure if anyone will ever read it all but if you're interested to know the \"spiritual\" upbringings of some dude you'll probably never meet, you're in the right place... you're a bit creepy for wanting to know about strangers but I guess that's my fault for posting here. So, go:\n\nBackground: In a nutshell I was a poster-boy for the Christian community. I was one of those kids raised in Kid's Church (Sunday school for the Americans) and went to two different Christian schools. As I grew up I became heavily involved in the church. Often I attended three services every week, played in youth and church bands, led and attended prayer/Bible study groups at school and socially... Ok so I was involved. Pretty heavily. You get the picture.\n\nNow, since leaving the world of \"30cm-rules\" and \"volunteering-for-eternal-rewards\" I've found many a hole in the Sunday hype and prosperity way of living. The continual stress of questioning if I could be doing more for the kingdom coupled with the hypocrisy within the church results in greater burdens than freedoms. I've been told continually I'm free meanwhile I feel that I'm shackled to God's conditions and the churches expectations. And if they aren't met, go to hell (literally).\n\nA close family member of mine has since \"come-out\" as an Atheist to our Christian family which has resulted in me doing a lot of questioning and soul-searching (which is an ironic phrase in this context). So I guess that's why I'm here reaching out to you humble reader of TrueAtheism. I'm wondering if there were there any particular sources/books/scholars that you've found very useful? Particularly when you began finding out about evolution, carbon dating, fossils, big bang etc. If so what/who are they? If you were previously religious, what was it that resulted in you moving away from your faith? I'd appreciate any amount of feedback, particularly if you were in a similar place to me growing up and have since embraced a non-spiritual view on the world.\n\ntl;dr - I've been raised a Christian. Good beginner sources? Your story from spirituality to scepticism.\n\nPS. I don't think I've use that many /, \", () and - before in my life. The punctuation is taking over.\n\n\nEDIT - Holy balls guys! Thanks so much for reading my midnight ramblings. I've just woken up to get ready for work so I'll be reading through all of the responses I can and starting a list of resources once I get home.

        "text": "My parents are great people, don't get me wrong. I know they love me, which is why they gave me this I'm sure. \n\nAnyhow, so they gave me an article from a Mormon magazine (the Ensign)  called \"The Answer to all the Hard Questions\". \n\nHere are some highlights to me that seem quite dubious in terms of their validity and logic. How do I counter these? I know everyone says not to argue, but I have discussed my views with my parents before and it's been really quite helpful. \n\n1. The only answer we need to respond to any question or problem with Faith is to trust in God's will for us. \n\nExcept that doesn't answer the question, and would it be fair to say that this is simply an appeal authority? \n\n2. God knows more than you. \n\nTo this I say: says who? Even then, how can I know that? See response to 1.\n\n3. If we trust God and wait long enough we can have subjective \"personal spiritual experiences\" that affirm our faith. \n\nMy counter is always to highlight the diverse and conflicting spiritual experiences people have. \n\nI have some general points to counter these, but seeking guidance and views on best ways to do this. I usually don't say anything, but the Mormon Church is so painfully manipulative and illogical I have to say something from time to time.\n\nThanks \n\nEdit: I know they gave me this article to convince me, I'm not trying to win them to my side, just give a logical explanation so I don't sound like some moron (Mormons think people never actually have good reasons for leaving or being atheists).

        "text": "The last 48 hours have seen two heinous attacks, 1 carried out in Sydney, the other carried out in Pakistan.\n\nThe Sydney one had clear Islamic undertones – posting messages like “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger” – the Pakistan one, while Islamic in nature, seemed to also be a product of retribution of previous attacks which was an “indiscriminate bombing in North and South Waziristan , in which many of our kids have died”  - Now of course, I don’t condone, the purposeful attack of children, nor do I rarely, if ever, think ‘an eye for an eye’ is the way to go about justice, but I do tentatively understand it, and see it as perhaps distinct from a crazed Muslim ideology.  \n\nIt did bring my attention to [Operation Rah-e-Nijat]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rah-e-Nijat) and the [War in North-west Pakistan]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_North-West_Pakistan) – which has been a decade long war against Al-Qaeda, as a “contribution to the international war on terror.”  So in a roundabout way, it is about Islamic fundamentalism, but one also has to wonder what would have happened if the U.S. and the west hadn’t pressured Pakistan to get into a war with Al-Qaeda.\n\nAnyway (I digress). The impetus for this post is a) the #I'llridewithyou twitter campaign.     and b) I typically listen to the CBC and they were talking about the causes of terrorism - what makes someone from Canada / the West join a terrorist group.  Different causes were offered: Mental Health, desire for power, feeling alone.  Of course, there was no mention of the role that Islam played.  \n\nNow seeing how those like Sam Harris get pegged as a bigot, the moment he mentions the problems with Islam, it does make sense, that radio hosts wouldn’t touch it with a 10-foot pole.   \n\nBut the fact that it’s difficult to have a fruitful discussion makes these moments vital for trying to explore and explain the problems with Islam and religion in general.   Some discretion is needed – and it’s important to clearly explain that this is a discussion about Islam, not Muslims – since most Muslims don’t truly practice Islam (same is true for every religion – e.g. most Christians don’t truly practice Christianity).   \n\nWhile  I love the #Illridewithyou campaign as a great support for one's fellow men and women and I hate the fact that people would target individuals who profess a muslim identity - I worry that it strengthens this dichotomous distinction between supporting of Muslims and criticizing Islam.  Criticizing Islam while there is a strong norm to support muslims - makes the conversation a difficult one to have.  \n\nTo be fair, I'm not exactly sure if I have a 'TL;DR' - but I did want to get my thoughts out, in the one place where they would be received with a critical eye.  I'd love to get your thoughts on this issue.\n",

        "text": "First of all, as long as I can remember I've been afraid of death. Never in my life (even as a young child) have I believed in God or an afterlife, even though everyone in my family is religious. It was always clear to me that there was nothing after death, that everything that we were, all our memories, all our experiences, all our joy, and everything that we lived for cease to exist. It used to keep me up all night when I was younger. Now I'm twenty years old and the same problem plagues me. During the day, while doing casual things, I suddenly panic knowing that eternal oblivion awaits me, and I wish with all my heart that there was an afterlife and I try to believe, to live blissfully never having to worry about the eternal oblivion. Unfortunately, a part of me knows that all the afterlife stories are rubbish and I continue to live in fear. It's especially horrible during the night, when I wake up every few hours terrified. I don't know what to do or what's the point of anything if in the end there's just this nothing. Some people say that you will live on through ancestors or through your actions, but I may just be selfish but I couldn't care less what happens if in the end there's just an eternal oblivion.... nothing matters..... \n\nHow do you guys cope with it? Am I the only one whose suffering from this? ",
