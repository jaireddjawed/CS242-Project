And open my eyes and see nothing, just a dark room. It would scare me and I would run up to my grandparents bed crying and begging to sleep with them. \n\nIt happened several times but I actively or clearly remember one specific time. I was sleeping downstairs and all of a sudden under my blanket I felt something, like fingers, crawling up my abdomen. I jolted awake and I remember for a split tiny second, I thought I should look under the covers. But then I got way too scared and I didn't want to look. I just jumped up and ran screaming upstairs. \n\nI've always wondered about it. Honestly it could have just been muscle twitches that I was expierencing. Has anyone expierenced this? It's kind of cool to think about now, it doesn't scare me anymore, I'm more intrigued now than anything.",

Jenifer was cooking dinner for us all and she looks away to grab something for not even 30 seconds and looks back and the pan she was cooking in had moved to a different hob that wasn't on as she wasn't using that one and it was vigorously shaking, she then put everything down left the kitchen and came into the living room and explained the story very obviously shocked , this was the first thing I had heard about anything paranormal in the house.\n\n2. Sometimes when she is taking my neice (4) to school I'll still be getting ready as she leaves before me so I will be alone in the house, I will hear footsteps in the hallway toilet flushes doors opening and closing (these are fire doors so open windows can't open them) and I have witnessed my room door opening a couple of times by its own no one in the house, and taps running, talking when no ones there ect every time I'm alone.\n\n3. For context again, neice (2) just turned 2 so there's balloons and a balloon arch way kinda thing with craft tissue tassel on in the living room, they're still all up as the kids like to play with the balloons well today I was sat in the living room by myself and the balloons start moving and making noise, I assume it's the cat going through the balloons as there's loads of them ( 90 not including the arch way ) so I say her name but it doesn't stop do I get up , and as I walk over the balloons drop from behind the Christmas tree as I hadn't seen them you know floating I'm obviously shocked, and these are regular balloons not helium so I realize it's not the cat what is going on yk , but they had stopped moving so I just sit back down after about a minute the balloons start moving again and the tassels on the arch way start pulling so I got out my phone to record cause I couldn't believe what was going on as soon as I do so everything stops for good and I explained what had happened to my sister and she pretty much says \"stuff like that happens all the time it's been going on for 2 years\" \n\nSomeone please explain is this a gd ghost or what",

I was confused ofc in the dream, but when I woke up I went and researched about it. There’s a planet that’s near Jupiter that is called GJ 504B. The color of the planet is the same exact color of the clothes he wore, same shade, same everything. I thought it was maybe a coincidence but the thing is that the planet is involved with the constellation and sign Virgo. I’m a Virgo. after that I never really had sleep paralysis again, I still have it here and there but it’s not as frequent as I used to. Coincidence I don’t know, but if anyone could help me identify anything related to this, it would be so helpful 🫶",

Since driving (I think a bit before I started) I have had an absurd amount of pure black cats appear, at least one or two every night (which is weirs because u don't see too many cats overall when I drive). Its not exclusive to my driving, I have seen them besides that too, they don't seem to be doing anything specific sometimes they come up to me for a pat when I'm delivering, some run away, others run across the road, etc, so I'm not sure if it actually means anything, I don't even really believe in signs but this is actually too many black cats there seem to be more black ones than any other colour somehow but I know thats not true for the area. I'd say at least 70% of cats iv encountered the last few months have all been all black, its also weird theyre all perfect black most black cats iv known before are so purely black or have socks, anyways what's your opinions, is it just nothing, or could it mean something? I also saw huge white hare the other night too right in the middle of the road which is really out of character for the neighbourhood.",

        "text": "So I am not that old but, I've had a few odd occurrences happen to me over the years. I have no clue what to make of them. \n\nThe first time I felt something weird, it was when I visited some friends of my grandfather. We went to this old house in a town about an hour away from where I live. When we sat in their living room, it felt like I was buried underground. Like the air around me was solid. I brought it up later that day but, my grandfather said he felt nothing weird.\n\nA few years later, I sat around a camp fire on a school camping trip. The adults were obviously telling us scary stories to freak us out. That was until my teacher took a picture of us. Above our heads sat a perfectly spherical thing that was pure white. It was definitely not the moon or something else. It looked so clear and striking compared to what was around it. Wish I had the picture.\n\nI've heard voices sometimes. They've been only one word or a breath close by. I always just assumed it was my imagination but, a few months ago, I'm not so sure now. The first time I heard a knock at my door. It sounded like the type of knock my mother would do to grab my attention. I stood up to check who knock just to realize that everyone in my house was just too far away from my door to have knocked. A few weeks later I'm in class listening to an accounting lecture. While there, I suddenly hear a girl's voice say \" Can I have ... \". I was like it was right next to me, the sentence also felt incomplete. I checked around me to see if anyone wanted something just to realize that all the girls were sitting in front of me. I felt confused and eventually just went on with the work.\n\nThese experiences are pretty much unrelated to each other but, maybe someone can help me understand what happened.",

She also gave me incense, dowsing rods, two barbie dolls to keep the girl content, a heavy pendulum, two balls that light up for yes or no questions (?) and instructions on how to talk to her through a spirit box. I've never homed a spirit before, nor did I really intend to. My sister currently has possession of her at my father's house. Should I give an update if anything happens? Or should I not be worried. Still unsure on what to do with it..",

It was so cold compared to the rest of the house,  that I remember even thinking to myself “dang that was cold I probably just walked into a ghost or something lol” but just shrugged it off.\nSo I get into my parents bathroom, I end up sitting Indian style on top of the bathroom counter I remember I was singing and doing my makeup just messing around.  Then I heard this sound, I stopped and looked around and didn’t see anything so I go back to doing what I was doing. Then I heard it again so I turn around and look down that’s when I saw one of  the drawers open by itself. Then after that the one below it pulled out, and then they all started opening and closing by themselves. I jumped off the counter and  just booked it out of there. Ran out of the house and refused to go back inside till my family came home. My whole family called me crazy and even asked if I did drugs which no I never have. Im in my 30s now and still stand by it even though no one believes me lol",

And then I had a few more at the same time, one who would just sit in a chair I had in the corner and one who’d stand in the corner pacing, sometimes he’d move to the edge of my bed, though.

Later on, a feminine shout could be heard, it sounded \"blanketed\" like it wasn't on the same plane or something. The interesting thing was that this was a non-phone crisp stereo digital recorder, it would have caught *any* pedestrian walking remotely close to it whether they walked on the grass or gravel, impossible to elude. \nEverything near was measurably distinct from what was far, at one point a male shouting a name could be heard in the far distance, likley a natural human source. But everything eerie was close(like within 4 feet close) and brief and completely free from attack/decay, like it's promptly \"butting\" in, if that makes sense. There's an odd non-organic filter to it, like it \"isn't\" there. \n\nThis got me interested in what this could be. Most googling led to the usual strident skeptic pages about the radio wave interference hypotheses, but those supposedly only get caught by cassette recorders.  Though some argue digital ones can catch radio too. \n\nA counter-argument to that is that not a *single* unintended snippet I've ever caught bears the *remotest* resemblance to music, isn't 60% of radio just that? Music? No commercial jingle, no riff, nothing. \nMost of it are grunts, with odd emotionally-loaded undertones.  \nAnd controlled experiments have caught these in controlled environments impervious to emitted signals. \n\nDoes it have to spirits anymore than stone tape theory?",

        "text": "There have been some weird noises and things going on in my house for a few months now, so I thought I would tell y'all what's going on and see what y'all think.\nThis past summer, my husband and I moved in with his mom as she is elderly and has health issues, and my husband felt that it wasn't safe for her to live by herself any longer. \nBefore we moved in we had been living a couple towns over, which was about 25-30 minutes from here. As we lived relatively close, I hadn't spent a significant amount of time here - never overnight, just would come visit for a few hours and then go back home.\nWell within the first couple weeks of living have, I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, something wasn't right with the house. I mentioned it to my husband, and he just kinda shook it off. He said that when his mom had bought the house about 12 years ago, he stayed here (in the same bedroom that we're in now) for about a month, and he hadn't noticed anything then. \nTo give you a frame of reference: it's a single story brick house with 3 bedrooms and about 1800 sf. There is an attic, but there isn't any stairs, it's more like a crawl space; there isn't a basement as we are in East Texas. When his mom bought the house, it had only been built two years prior as it was the model home for the newly constructed subdivision.\nOk so this is what's been happening....\nFor about a week and a half to two weeks after I had mentione feeling the weird vibes, my husband started waking up in the middle of the night, but not understanding why. This would happen 2-3 times a week, and he wouldn't be able to fall back asleep for another hour or two. Well by the second week of this occuring, he would just lay in bed listening and looking out our partially opened bedroom door, which allows you to see part of the living room and partly into the kitchen, watching the shadows in that area. At this point, he'd be awake for 3-4 hours before being able to go back to sleep. He said that sometimes it would look like the shadows would move, but he attributed that to the motion light outside the front door, which partially illuminates the living room as the front door is beveled glass. \nThen things started to get a little weird.\nAfter a week or so, on and off, of watching the shadows, one night when he was awakened, he thought he could hear two people talking outside our bedroom, on the other side of the wall in the side yard. At this point, he woke me up and asked me to listen if I could hear the talking as well. And yep, I sure could. So he got up, grabbed his pistol and went outside; he first walked the perimeter, and then around the back yard and behind the buildings out back, but he couldn't find anyone or anything. \nWe've been here for about six months and every so often, we'll hear talking (usually it occurs some time after midnight to 3 or 4 am) but there's no one outside.\nI have also had my own strange auditory occurances. I've heard it maybe 3-5 times since we've been here, the most recent was last night. \nAll the times that I've heard it, has been around 10-11 pm, while I've been in the walk-in closet in our bedroom. Suddenly I'll hear, BOOM BOOM BOOM, like someone is knocking real loud on a wall or door, but I can't pinpoint where in the house it's coming from. When I heard it last night, I quickly walked out into the living room to see if someone was really knocking on the front door. Well when I went out there, my dog was laying on the floor, in the area between the LR and the kitchen, and he just looked up at me, wondering what the hell I was doing. He has excellent hearing, so if anyone had knocked, he would have been barking. \nI went back into my room, to inside the closet to finish what I was doing. Not even a minute or two later, I hear the knocking again, but this time it's more of an urgent rapid BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM, like someone wants in RIGHT NOW.\nCan anyone make sense of this? Has anyone experienced this themselves? \nThanks for y'alls input!",

        "text": "I was staying at my cousin's house over the weekend, he stayed in my aunt's room because I was going to pull an all-nighter. His cat, Princess, kept walking in the room and meowing, after telling my friend at the time about it, I followed Princess out of the room and down the short hallway that connects 3 bedrooms and a bathroom to the living room. Princess looked under this nightstand against the fish tank and the wall that was used for holding the fish food. She ran backward, ears back, as if she was afraid or in a defensive state over whatever was under there, she ran back down the short hallway into my cousin's room. In a slight panic, I look around the living room, I see a shadowy blob standing above the couch dividing the living room and kitchen that my grandma was sleeping on. After 5 seconds at most, it just dropped behind the couch. I walked over to the couch, cautiously, nothing was behind the couch, I checked the time, it was just about 3.\n\n This was about 4-5 years ago and I was a sleep deprived 11 year old, but I doubt it was my sleep deprivation that made me see this shadow.\n\nJust wanted to get this story off my chest, and potentially get some kind of answers on what this could mean.",

Around a month ago, my niece, who I’m going to call Rory, started to talk to something and when I asked who she was talking to she said “the ooie” now normally I would think of an imaginary friend, but we usually tell her that the “ooie” will get her if she doesn’t go potty or listen to what we’re telling her, so basically it scares her into doing what we tell her(I know kinda mean, but she’s stubborn) so when she said this and proceeded to continue to talk to it and then look at me and laugh and go back to watching her show like nothing happened it freaked me out. I mean it could be a imaginary friend but people also say kids are more likely to see the paranormal.\n\nplus, me along with my family have experience other paranormal things in the house for years, so I wouldn’t be surprised if she did see something or someone.",

The one I remember the most vividly was my grandpa, mom, and sister were in the kitchen talking about something but grandma was just there shouting ‘you’re not listening to me’. I never really took much stock in dreams of loved ones passed, I chalked it up to just subconsciously missing them mixed with anxiety or something. This one made me stop believing in that, I just wish I knew what grandma wanted them to hear her say. I haven’t had a dream with her in it in a while, now it’s just sometimes night terrors that my husband has to wake me up from.",

As I walked down the stairs, I heard sort of a deep, gravely, female voice go \"Nnnnnnnnnnn Baaht.\" I turned there was a very thin woman with very long black hair covering her face and most of her body. She threw her hair over me like a net and captured me. I somehow knew to close my eyes because to look into her eyes would make the capture complete. As I struggled to get away, she stuck her long nails into my middle back, to the right of my spine, digging her nails into my skin. (yes my nack hurts) I started grabbing handfuls of hair, trying to rip my way free, all the while she would growl, \"Nnnnnnnnng Baaht.\" Once I had ripped enough hair, she would let me go, only to chase and capture me again. I would find myself in a completely different place each time. Sometimes, there were people around confused as to what I was running from as they only saw a friend chasing me. I looked at her as I ran and saw that she had no eyes. She just had partially open eyelids and skin/muscle? where the eyeball should be. I've never actually seen a person without eyes before, but I'm guessing this is what it would look like. What I am wondering is, does anyone know of a spirit or a demon like this? I'm guessing some sort of Asian or possibly Middle Eastern spirit. I looked up baht or bhat but that didn't give me much.",

I of course believe in the paranormal, and try to stay far away from aggravating the peace, or touching something I should not. She told me the doll was haunted by a little spirit named Amber. I was given toys and an explanation on how to keep her content.  She gave me incense, an explanation of how to communicate with her (A spirit box type thing, and two ball lights that the doll is supposed to set off. Dowsing rods, and a heavy pendulum. I can't share any pictures of the doll, or any of the screenshots, due to being limited to my pc. But here is the description she sent for the doll. \"Amber is the spirit of a 6-year-old girl who is full of energy. When she was alive she wanted to be a grown-up so bad. She would join her mom in manicures and pedicures and put on face masks. She loved having slumber parties with her friends and playing with Barbies. She loved coloring and putting on her mom's makeup as well. Lol... her mom wasn't too happy about that. Amber didn't have a bad childhood, she was raised by loving parents and was killed way too soon when she developed a rare illness that stumped doctors. She was very sad she passed away and wishes she could have grown up. Now she is looking for a home where she can have toys to play with, friends and a nice keeper who will take care of her. She loves food offerings and juice offerings. She is active and will around the house, knock on walls and move her toys. She is very sweet and will make a great spirit friend for the first time spirit keeper or more advanced.  She can't wait to find her new forever home. She does leave her vessel often and follow you around so if you feel a presence behind you that's most likely Amber just trying to see what you're doing. She communicates very well with all divination tools and loves her stuffed animals! If you feel you can give her a forever home, she's here waiting for you!\" What in the world do I do?",

        "text": "So my sister and her roommates at college have been living in this newly renovated house for about 6 months. Originally built in 1917. Weird stuff has been happening more and more frequently. It’s an old house so a lot of it can be “old houses make weird noises”, but doors opening and closing by themselves, faucets turning on by themselves, and the most recent being a pair of scissors from the dining room table stuck in the bottom of the staircase. This was not witnessed, the scissors were just found like that. Of course Google tells her it’s an omen for death. Scissors were found on the 5th (this is important for later). \n\nNow this is where it gets weird. The landlord shrugs off all their complaints saying “I’m not spiritual at all, there’s probably a logical explanation for all of this stuff happening”. So the girls take it upon themselves to look up the previous owner of the home. They say they had a lot of weird stuff happen to them as well. They renovated one of the bedrooms and found some handwritten scriptures (not sure which at  the moment, but trying to get her to find out more) and a worry doll IN THE WALLS. Upon talking to the previous owner some more, they found out that there had been two deaths in the house a few years apart…both on December 7. Now can someone please explain to me what the fuck is going on? My sister is freaking out, staying in a hotel for the week. She comes home for winter break for a few weeks, but is not exactly excited to go back to that house afterwards.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, so this is happening right now and I just want to know if anyone has dealt with or is currently dealing with a similar situation or even heard of something like what we as a family are going through. \n\n\n\nMy mom contacted me 2 days ago looking for help with her dog since I train dogs for a living. Starting around 2 weeks ago their dog Henry started acting strangely when left alone during the day. Not every day either, just seemingly random occurences of violence.  A little background on Henry. He is a Neutered Male 3 year old Australian Shepherd that my parents have owned since he was 10 weeks old. He has lived in their house basically his entire life and has shown no negative behaviors besides being an escape artist until this 'event'. During the day, when my parents go to work, Henry is left by himself with free roam access to the main living spaces. He has weekly play dates and my mom goes home for lunch every day. Henry is not left alone for more than a few hours. As a dog trainer my first thought is seperation anxiety or a lack of meaningful stimulus but i cant help feeling like he is either being directly attacked or being harrassed.\n\nWhen my parents come home, their house is destroyed, I cant attach  pictures to show the extent of the damage but it is Extensive..... DM me if youd like to see the pictures and the text conversations. So Books ripped off the shelves, glassware smashed, xmas tree toppled, and henry is found cowering in a hiding place. for instance  He blew off a lot of fur while cowering in their bath tub. Henry is also alerting towards the basement door. At the same time as their house getting destroyed things are going missing. Mom told me that on wednesday, after dinner, the power cord for their rice cooker disappeared. the rice cooker was used that night and was not unplugged by either my mom or dad. on that same day the power cord for their xmas decoration also seemingly poofed out of existence.\n\nHere is where it gets really odd. I live In New Jersey while my parents live in Massachusetts, 186 miles away. i have a samsung s22 ultra, it has a built in stilus. I was using it to scroll and put it down to send a text message while sitting on the couch. the stilus disappeared from where i put it down I could not find it after 30ish minutes of looking. it was missing long enough for me  to look into getting a replacement. My wife has a spare pen from her old s21. its a different shape so i  went to see if it would fit in my phone but my missing one was back in my phone. I didnt put it there, my wife didnt either and up to that moment it was gone. the whole reason i was looking for a new one was that when you walk away from your pen the phone will alert you to it being missing and it leaves a small icon showing that your pen isnt docked. Its annoying so i know it was missing. this is just the latest in a long long history of things diapearing and reappearing on their own. The weirdest part is that a lot of the time if the thing doesnt appear exactly where it was left then it shows back up in a shoe. over the years things that i have seen disappear and reappear in shoes include, a ipod, samsung galaxy buds, a ring, money, a tv remote. In the last couple days my dog has been alerting on the bedroom door. crying and sniffing with raised hackles. \n\nI sent out a group message to my family to see if anyone else is experiencing stuff. Grandma says the xmas lights are being turned off on their own, and my brother in law is experiencing lights being turned off as well. grandma is in Texas. so yea we have 4 different family members in 3 states seprated by the country experiencing if not linked then similar oddities. \n\nThoughts???",

        "text": "I live with my mom and her parents in Ohio, a house on the corner of two busy streets. Ranging from about 8pm to 11pm these past two nights, my grandma has been complaining of weird things happening. \n\nFirst, two nights ago at about 8 or 9 pm, she opened her bedroom door and asked my mom and I if we were pounding on her door. Obviously none of us did, so I figured it was one of our dogs or cats clawing at the door. I look to see my cat asleep on my desk chair, and my mom’s dog in her room with my mom. Also note that nobody heard the “pounding” besides her. My mom suggested it may have been one of my grandma’s cats in her room, but she insists it sounded like human fists banging on the door. \n\nLast night, my grandma was in my room sitting with me while I was showing her a video game she was interested in. My room is split up into two sections, one main room, with a bed, my desk and computer, and a dresser, which sits by an open doorway that leads out into the sunroom where I sleep and play video games in. The doorway normally has a blanket covering it, sort of like a makeshift curtain, but this time it was slid a little bit to the side because of my grandma being in the room. We were sitting there talking when all of a sudden, we BOTH heard this kind of unexplainable noise coming from the main room. It sounded like gargling, but not quite? There was something almost electronic about it, and we both sat in silence listening to it for about 3 or 4 seconds. Then, when it stopped, my closest guess was maybe my cat was throwing up, but alas, he was sleeping on the chair yet again, as that’s his favorite spot to lay. It sounded like nothing I’ve heard before, and still have no clue what it is. I’m sure there’s a logical explanation for both experiences but it’s creepy to think my grandma has some of supernatural presence following her as she approaches her 80s. Thought I’d share.",

It was in the season between summer and winter so there were little to no guests, after everyone came they all gathered in the storage room. Before continuing i have to say it was packed with things like canned food and other storage items,and its a small room. \n\nIt was around midnight when they began to do an ouija session in there. They did not have a professional board or anything like that so they just improvised and wrote the letters on a piece of paper and the simple yes or no. they got a little glass and everyone put their fingers on it.\n\nThen they began, the ask simple questions and after some asking they knew that it was a small girl talking to them. My mom said that she thought it was all a joke but after some said they should ask that the ghost should make itself known.\n\nRight after asking, a glassjar fell or more like flew over their heads and shattered on the ground. Everyone was in utter shock and ran out of the chamber.\n\nShe told me they never completed the session with a goodbye or anything and never talked about it again.\n\nidk it seems just so creepy to me that sonething like that happened to my mom. (im sorry if some things seem weird its all i know she does not really talk about it)\n\ni want to hear your thoughts about it!! :) personally it really freaks me out. \nim gonna answer as many questions as i can",

They stopped to talk to me (this is the deserted corner of the parking lot) and I tell them I'm looking for some type of wax for my car and windshield washer fluid. They said they were working on the oil change shop. They didn't have work boots on and one was wearing a polo shirt.\n\nAlso this is not the spot for panhandlers because the street barely gets any traffic other than Menard's. Somehow it felt like they were benevolent. Something striked me that they were there directly to help me. They had a joy about them that I couldn't find typical to people in parking lots... In other words, I think they were angels. They walked into Menard's with me and helped find everything I needed. They didn't get anything for themselves. They were telling me about different things as we were walking through Menard's, like which bathroom shower lining was the best etc.\n\nAfter I got back to my car, they walked back to the oil change place but I didn't see them after they got there... I have never been to Menard's by myself so I feel like angels were sent to help me... Anyone have thoughts or analysis of what happened?",

        "text": "This happened about 6 years ago but i still remember everything clear as day. \nWhen my Aunt Pam passed away she was living in a home. All of her belongings were in a storage unit. Her son, who inherited all of her belongings, picked through all the things he wanted and invited some of the close family (my mother and her sisters) to come and pick whatever we wanted. At the unit my cousins and I banded together and found some items we were fond of. I took these little purple potions bottles, purple China set, purple bedding set with matching curtains. If my aunt and I had one thing in common, it was our love for the color purple. I fell in love with the items and was super excited to bring them home and bring them back to life by giving them a purpose. Upon returning to the house my sisters and I rushed inside to decorated our rooms with our Aunt Pam's belongings. I set up almost an alter esc type place on my vanity with all of the potion bottles around the China set. My vanity sat right across my sitting area in the opposite corner of the room. \nNighttime rolls around and my sisters and I are in our separate rooms. My sister Abbey is in the room right next to mine with Maddy being right across from her. I'm sitting in my little reading nook, nose deep in a series I'd been binging. My lamp flickers twice and I lift my head to see what gives, happens more often than not in our house. I lock eyes with a figure, a woman a blacked out silhouette. She looks as if she's swimming in water. Her hair is large and curly, floating around her. While I couldn't see a face i could see it in my brain as if she was projecting her image to me. Her eyes glowed a faint white. Her hand was out reached towards the set of China and potion bottles on my vanity. At first she wasn't looking at me, I sat holding my breath. \nI stare at her in fear fully aware it's my Aunt but absolutely Terrified at seeing her. She snaps her head towards me and my light turns off. I scream as loud as I can for my sister unable to move. She bursts into my room and turns the light on asking what the hell is going on. I'm blabbering, trembling, crying, trying my best to explain while Abbey is trying her best to keep it together. My screams caused my other sister to wake up as well and she comes into the room rubbing her eyes and telling me to shut up. Were all talking over each other and discussing who I'm gonna sleep with when we hear a bang in the kitchen. \nMy parents were extremely strict on eating schedules, we weren't allowed in the kitchen after dinner (6pm) and it was now 10pm. My parents slept in the master bedroom, which was the attic above the garage. In order for them to come down they would have to open the very heavy door, walk down the extremely loud steps, open the obnoxiously loud screeching screen door, etc. The point is, we would've heard loud and clear if anyone came downstairs. \nWe all froze staring at each others, my sisters eyes widen as we all realize what's happening. We're listening closely and it sounds like people are ransaking the cabinets, moving around the silverware, and that the pots that hung on the ceiling were banging into each other. \nSilence falls for a moment and my sister maddy (the fearless one) decided to check it out. We follow behind her in a single file down the hall. Maddy turns the corner into the kitchen and she takes a step back, her eyes wide and scanning around. Me and my sister poke our heads around. \nEvery drawer and cabinet are open and the pots on the ceiling are still swinging slightly. We stand there stunned for a moment then we all sprint upstairs banging on our parents door. \nWe explain what happened and my mother is extremely annoyed. She pulls us the camera to the kitchen and there it is in all its glory. Our mother isn't one for emotions. She just got to making a pallette in her room for all of us to sleep on. \nEventually we sleep and wake up for school the next morning. My sisters seem to feel better but I was still very shaken. We're sitting in the living room and I ask if Maddy wouldn't mind grabbing my brush and other items from my room (I refused to go out of fear) she said yes as she was tying her shoes. Suddenly we hear a noise from the back. We all go quiet to hear what it is. It's a piano. My piano in my room. I was terrified asking if they heard it and Abbey clings to me. Maddy walks to the back to retrieve my items unfazed as I ask her to check my piano because I knew it was unplugged. She emerges moments later with my items and I ask about the piano. With a stright face she tells me \"It was unplugged and  off.\" \nNeedless to say I didn't sleep in my own room for 3 months. While rooming with my parents my mother had me look at photos of family members. It wasn't the first time a deceased family member came to visit me, sometimes I knew them sometimes I didn't. My mother could also see them, it was a normal thing in our house. In the box was a photo of my aunt Pam in her mid 20's, and I pointed to it telling my mom it was her. My mom just nodded and said she was probably coming to say goodbye. Still did not make me feel any better. Still extremely terrifying. Gives me goosebumps to this day.",

My house is small, so we decided she'd just share my bed. The first night (I can't remember the exact time, but before midnight), I woke up to her screaming bloody murder. She was sitting up and just screaming, it was terrifying. \nAfter a brief moment of scanning the room, I concluded she was having a nightmare. Ok, no problem, right? Just wake her up. I reached over to her and tried to tell her it's ok, she's only dreaming. My mouth felt taught, and I couldn't get my words out correctly. It's hard to explain, but like I was trying to stretch out my mouth but it wouldn't open like it should. After about 10-20 seconds of her continuing to scream and me trying to tell her she's dreaming and to wake up, she finally stopped. Whimpering, she asked \"'name' is that you?\" I told her yes, and just hugged her, telling her she was just dreaming. She said she had seen me trying to wake her up and talking, but that I sounded like a demon, and that's why she kept screaming. \n\nNow normally, I would write this off to sleep paralysis or a bad nightmare, but it took me a full few minutes to be able to talk normally again. I've never experienced anything like that before, and honestly it was terrifying. I didn't sleep the rest of the night, and ended up moving to the couch for the few nights after that because I was so scared of hearing her scream like that again. I rationalized at least I'd have some time between being woken and getting to her that I wouldn't lose my ability to talk normally again. \n\nHas anyone ever experienced something like this before? It seems silly, but it really freaked me out.",

Prayers from different religions are usually said in a specific way, I dunno how to describe... Mantra-like? Maybe that causes a similar reaction like with meditation, but very extreme because of the circumstances?\n\nI'm not saying if ghosts are real or anything whatsoever with this, I'm also not denying it as an option, I'm just saying if maybe some of this is why a spirit, either that of a human or not, would have a strong reaction to religious objects and prayers at moments like this? Does someone know more about it?",

Sounds, that weren't human-like or like anything I or my mom have heard of (she was there next to me), and today my voice is all raspy because of that.\n\nOther times I have done things like singing in another language or talk in a weird voice, do more weird sounds, or things such as hurting myself while I tell myself to stop but my body is moving on its own. Also, I get this strength that is particularly weird for me because I'm disabled, normally I'm weak as a feather, and I am interested in knowing how to stop being weak as a feather. It's similar with when I do weird poses like the spider one, plus I make them very fast, and then when I'm back to normal I do physiotherapy and can't do shit.\n\nSometimes the lights flicker or something falls, but those may as well be casualities, just I have seen those things associated with the topic too so I'm adding them. I also get scared by crosses or such.\n\nAlso in case someone wonders; yes, I do have doctors, I am diagnosed, I do take medications...\n\nI don't believe this has to be paranormal exactly, but I know it is associated to it such as exorcisms or possessions etc, and I fear being judged if I ask somewhere else, although it may happen here too... If there's another sub I could ask this in tell me.",

        "text": "I've had a few unexplained experiences in my life and will post them all eventually but this was the most terrifying. \n\nMy grandparents had a holiday (vacation) home on the Isle of Wight UK.  The house itself was a grand Victorian mansion that had been turned into apartments. My grandparents had the ground floor apartment that included the garden with a sea view from the cliff tops. It really was beautiful. \n\nI have a large family and we all stayed there regularly,  together or with our separate family's. Over the years family members had seen things like an aperitaion in the hall, an aperitaion of  a Victorian lady walking across the garden. A few people had witnessed the wardrobe fly open in the middle of the night but I had not seen or heard a thing over 20 years. \n\n My grandparents were getting older and wanted to sell their holiday home.  For the last night I stayed ther with my family. My parents were in one bedroom, and my brother and sister were with me in another.  There are two beds, a wardrobe in the room along with an en suit shower. \n\nDuring the night my younger brother (12) got up and started sleepwalking ( first and only time - he's now 31) He stood in the en suite and kept repeating that he had to go to work. My brother hated the en suite from a baby. It was dark and creepy and had no windows, he would never use it. I guided him back to his camp bed and we both went back to sleep. \n\nLater in the night I woke up because I heard a loud banging sound. I looked around and saw my brother and sister sleeping. The banging continued, I looked behind me where the sound was coming from and saw the headboard was moving back and forth from the wall, I then realised my bed was infact shaking. The room became blacker than black ( hard to explain) I  was terrified and hid under the covers. I was so petrified I think I passed out because I can't remember trying to get back to sleep. \n\nWhen I got up I told my siblings at the breakfast table. My brother said \"That happend to me\". He said years before the same thing had happend to him but he kept screaming for mum and dad, he  said the room got darker too. He had never told anyone the story. He's an adult now and still doesn't believe it was paranormal. \n\nI can't really explain what happened that night. I mentioned about my brother sleepwalking as it was so out of character for him, it just felt part of all the weirdness. I don't think it's sleep paralysis as I distinctly remember moving around in the bed. \n\nWould love to here thoughts, malevolent or playful?  I normally loose people when I get to the bed shaking bit. I know it sounds far fetched but It really did happen.",

        "text": "This story directly follows the last. Surprisingly, I fell asleep that night. Only to awaken laying face down with the pressure of 4 big paws pressing me down into the bed. It felt like I couldnt breathe and I fought to get this \"thing\" off my back. This wasn't sleep paralysis as I have never experienced it in the past or since. I finally flipped around and nothing was there. Once again to my surprise, I was able to fall asleep that night. \n\nNow I wasn't new to playing with ouija boards at this point. I probably won't even include those experiences in this series because those weren't anything special compared to the other things I've seen and heard first hand. However, it might be helpful in future context.\n\nA few years later, I must've been about 17 at the time of this incident. My older brother, his girlfriend and I were up late looking in the kitchen for snacks. (The usual midnight munchies) I remember the time being just passed 3 am as I had commented about it being the \"devil's hour\". Moments passed and my brothers girlfriend was getting freaked out by the dark stair well in the hall. There was a door between the stairway hall and the lit kitchen so she closed the door. We were making snacks and joking as usual but I kept hearing noises that seemed to be coming from the stairwell. I got closer to the now closed door way and the door knob started to jiggle. I must've thought something along the lines of \"no way\" as I stared in disbelief. I called my brothers girlfriend over and she stared at the knob with me. I kid you not the door handle turned by itself and the door swung open. There was no draft and my house is old, so the doors are  heavy and don't swing like that on their own.  My brother, who is sceptical of this kind of stuff was visibly confused. I asked whatever opened the door to shut it and it wouldn't. We had the idea to go into the dark hallway before the stairs. I asked again for whatever was playing with the door to shut it. The door slammed closed with force. My brothers girlfriend and I were way freaked out by this point so we went back into the light of the kitchen. Whenever we were in the dark hall the door would stay shut. Whenever we were in the kitchen where there was light, the door would swing open even after closing it multiple times, as if whatever was moving the door, was inviting us into the dark.",

Not like regular bangs, I sounded like someone was taking a wrecking ball to the house. You could feel the vibrations from those first 3 bangs. It startled us and we ran outside to see if maybe someone had wrecked into the house or had broken in, but nothing. We’re scoping out the house when I noticed my basement door was open, mind you we kept 3 locks on this door. We’re walking down to the basement when all of a sudden we hear them again, just as loud, but coming coming from where my parents room is. We run back there to see what’s going on, nothing. As we’re calming down talking about what happened in the living room the basement door slams shut &amp; now we’re back on high alert. We run downstairs because now we’re convinced someone is in the house. No one. We’re standing in the middle of the basement when we heard 3 more loud bangs coming from upstairs again. At this point we’re literally shaking in fear because we can figure out what the heck is going on. We pack up the dog &amp; our things to go back to his house. No one ever believed us.",

Then when it started all my illusion fell, the whole tour was a more theatrical insight into a kind of exorcism. Instead of feeling disappointed I was very grateful because I had a lot of fun during the whole play.   \n\nThe next day I was cooking some lunch for the family and I decided to get some water from the fridge, and the water was at room temperature (because my brother didn´t fill the water jar on time) and when I let it sit on the table to get a cup, the jar just explored and I got like 3 pieces on me. I decided to clean it all up before someone noticed it, but then I realized that it was very difficult that this happened because the jar was at room temperature and it just exploded out of nowhere. \n\nThis was only the start anyways because every day something different happened, like yesterday when all the plants that I took care of for years started to wither.\n\nOr on the weekend when I started to hear the doorknobs of rooms that were already opened or people walking on the second floor when nobody was around. \n\nMy family is kinda concerned by the situation but they are waiting for this event to disappear one day by itself. \n\nI don´t know what is happening, so I decided to think that is a spirit that followed me to my house and is causing all these unexpected events.\n\nDoes someone know what all of this means?  \n\n(If you know wtf is happening I would be very grateful)",

I didn't feel him leave, or have a spiritual moment. My mom once told me a story about being there with one of our family friends who died in front of her after suffering from pancreatic cancer. She said she could almost see his spirit leave his body.\n\nI was sort of expecting something similar to happen with my papa. He had suffered from dementia for 8-10 years. He was put in a home in April of this year. About 2 months ago he fell and fractured his wrist and broke 3 ribs. Then he fell again in the home and cracked his hip just before thanksgiving. He could no longer speak because he just couldn't form the words anymore. He stopped eating on Thanksgiving. He was ready. We were really lucky to get him home before he passed. He lives about 6 hours from me, and my family was able to get there just hours before he took his last breath.\n\nA little after he passed I went downstairs to grab something and the light below him was flickering. The whole next day this electric candle next to where he died was on all day long. These candles are sensitive to light and have a timer. They are only suppose to go on when it gets dark and it stays on for 8 hours. My grandma says she could still feel him there the next day - for context she is very sensitive to these things. She has many experiences that are unexplained and usually around lights.\n\nSo I guess I just am not sure why I didn't feel him leave, and why my mom had this moment with someone but she said the same thing this time. She didn't have the same experience.",

        "text": "Now I just wanna start this off by saying I was 5,6 or 7 when this happened; I have plenty of ghost stories to share but this is one that I think about daily. Sorry if i mess up anything I type, feel free to ask for clarifications on anything I say and I will try to help clarify it for better understanding. \n\nDue to me being so young at the time and I was kinda anxious so the chance of details getting mixed up is very likely. I am known for putting too much nonsense in the things I say/post so I will add a tldr at the bottom.\n\nAnyways, let’s hop into it. I will give some context info first: my neighbor’s family and my family were very close at the time close to the point that we were allowed to stay over at each other’s houses on school nights due to how much trust the parents had in each other at the time. D1 is my friend.   B1 is my friend’s cousin.   S1 is my sister.   NS1 is my friend’s mom and B1’s aunt. That’s all the people who are in this incident. \n\n(I would like to add in that we all drifted apart after they moved but me and D1 stayed friends and I recently stopped talking to her this/last year so I can’t really ask if they remember the incident word for word.)\n\nSo, I was in school but I got picked up early by my mom so she could take me shopping for clothes for an upcoming trip we were having soon. Once we got back, we saw NS1 unloading her car, she went to the local grocery store whereas we went to a Walmart about an hour away.  We asked if she needed any help and she said no, she then asked us the same thing and my mom told her we only had a few things that and it’s mostly clothes so we were fine. NS1 asked if I wanted to come over once we were done unloading our stuff and I asked my mom what time it was and she said there’s about an hour till the bus comes and drops everyone off so I asked her if I could go over there now and she said as soon as we finish you can go over there which I did. \n\nI was getting bored playing by myself so I asked NS1 if I was allowed to watch a movie and she said of course and turned on The Lion King then placed the remote on the couch next to where I sat. I was watching the beginning and all of a sudden the movie paused, I thought I did it so I looked over and I saw the remote didn’t move an inch so there’s no way I did it. As I was about to grab the remote to unpause the tv I saw what I described to NS1 after I got scared and ran outside to where she was as “a million flashlights being shined all on the roof and waving around.” \n\nShe dismissed me thinking I was playing around with her and just trying to get her to come watch the movie with me. I walked back inside still a little nervous, i made it to the door; I looked to the right, no flying lights, I looked to the left, no flying lights. I slowly walked back to the couch and unpaused the movie. I was thinking that I may have just imagined that but I kept telling myself “it was too real. I seen it!” \n\nThe first few minutes played through: no incident, nearly convinced myself I did imagine it. Until it happened again. The tv paused. The lighted were everywhere, all over the roof, I looked over to B1’s bedroom door and I could see them coming from that direction. I wanted to go see it but I didn’t want to go into his room, always a mess and he was very protective of his room so I thought I’d he knew I went in there, even to see where the lights were coming from, he’d kill me without a second thought. I was still sitting on the couch looking at the door when one came up and went by my face at the speed of light. I realized that they were like balls flying around on the roof, they weren’t lights. \n\nI ran outside to tell NS1 what I saw again. She brushed me off, just like last time. As I was walking in, she stopped me and said “I’ll stand on the porch and keep an eye on you if that will make you feel better.” And I said “Yay! Now you’ll see the ball things too!” \n\nA little while goes by and the same thing happens again. The movie stops. The ball things come out of B1’s again. I ran outside but this time S1 and NS1 were outside on the porch together, talking. I told them what happened and NS1 acted as if this was her first time hearing about it S1 then told me to go sit on the couch and she’ll keep an eye on me. Before I went back inside I asked where d1 was and S1 said “she’s next door looking for you, once me and NS1 stop talking I’ll go and tell her you’re over here and you wanna watch a movie with her.” \n\nI went back inside, unpaused the tv,  knowing it would happen again: those ball things reappearing, me going outside, me telling them, not getting believed, going back inside and starting the cycle over again. \n\nFinally, it happened again, the tv paused… there were more this time, a lot more. There was so many on the roof above me, I turned towards the door, S1 staring at me with the look of she just saw a ghost struck on her face. I ran to the door. She opened it for me and we both told NS1 what happened and she finally believed me. \n\nI went back over to my house and met B1 and D1 at the door as I was coming in, they were wanting to watch the movie. I told them I’d rather play outside and that’s what we did.  \n\nI told my mom about it later that night but S1 and NS1 got to her already and told her about it. She told me it was orbs and they were protecting me. I still don’t know if they were actually orbs or not, I don’t know how much my mom knew about orbs and stuff like that at the time so that’s why I say it may not have been orbs but the reason I marked orbs on this post is be because that’s the thing that makes the most sense. Orbs and haunted house but the story mainly focuses on (possible) orbs. \n\nThe end I guess.. I know, very boring ending but whatever. My 5,6 or 7 year old brain didn’t want to possibly die by going back to the house. Hope you enjoyed. \n\n\n                                   TLDR\n\nWent over to my neighbors house to wait for D1 and I watched a movie while waiting, the movie would pause and (possible) orbs would appear. NS1 didn’t believe me until S1 saw it too and told her about it. That’s just about it.\n\n\n\nIf you know anything about orbs or anything like that, feel free to inform me about whatever you can.",

        "text": "About a half-mile upthe road from My house is a small cemetery where most of my family is buried, as well as a few other families in my community. It's in a very rural area, surrounded by cow pastures on three sides and an orange grove across the road. There's a \"chapel\" in the front, which is more or less just a pole barn with two rows of benches under the roof. It gives shade and seating for holding a service.\n\nA few months back I was driving home from work, it would have been ~11:30 at night. As I passed the cemetery, I saw her - A thin woman, sitting in the front row of the chapel. She had a white sundress, a big floppy hat that covered her face, and a luggage bag by her side. There was nobody else in the cemetery, no cars around, and all *two* houses on the road were dark. I didn't feel threatened or scared or anything, but it was enough to make my hair stand on end as I drove past.\n\nI don't know why, but I started thinking about her again the last couple days. I don't know who she was waiting for, but I hope they found each other",

It's like a camouflage suite like a predator or an invisible man but better quality, if you get what I mean.\n\nIt's not my first paranormal experience, and I for some reason doubt it's even paranormal. I feel like it's human but I'm not sure.  Even so I could have a new foe to deal with.  Anyone have any related articles to study or any experience let me know.",

        "text": "I told one story the other week and I’m back at work so I’ll tell another. A few months back I woke up and went downstairs to get ice cream. When I got downstairs I saw a white elongated face looking at me through my front door. Of course i that was weird but I decided to go into the kitchen to get my ice cream. When I looked in the kitchen I saw another elongated figure with the same face looking at me. So of course i looked back at the other to see if it was still there and it was. I decided that they can’t get inside so whatever I got my ice cream and went back to my room and locked the door. I don’t remember much after that. I know it sounds made up cause of how casual I am about it. I’ve seen things since I was a kid and just got use to it. I will say the figures were at least 7 ft tall and had black holes for eyes and mouth. I told a friend of mine about it and he got freaked out and told me how a lot of people don’t know they exists and that they are malevolent or whatever. He is a medium so I heard him out. I would assume it was just a dream but the ice cream I got out of the fridge was in the trash can when I woke up the next afternoon. ( I work night and sleep during the day) Anyways what do y’all think. I’m not a hard believer in anything but I’m open minded 🤷🏽‍♂️",

        "text": "***trigger warning: suicide and mental health.***\n\n-\n\n-\n\nMy Tante passed away the year before I was born. Sadly she took her own life. This plays a huge part in my expierence. I don't know if it's paranormal or anything, it could just have a psychological aspect but I just want to share. All my life people have told me about her, she was my mom's sister and they were really close. I learned so much about how she was like from my family. And she was amazing. I always felt this longing to see her again, or like I feel like i know her and I miss her. When I was 18 I started to get really really suicidal and just going through a really dark time, stuff that wasnt related to my tante, it was my stuff. I remember going for a nighttime walk and being convinced and ready to do it and I just was thinking about it really heavily. It wasn't going to be that day though. And then I felt in my mind a voice pleaded with me not to do it and they said they promise it would get better. It was a really vivid thought but it was different than my normal thoughts. It wasn't my internal dialog. It was like hearing somebody else in my head. I always connected that expierence with it being my Tante telling me that. I just feel like it was.\n\nBut this story isn't really about suicide but I've also been realizing that have this same longing and missing feeling of the afterlife,  i feel sometimes that I can't wait to go back there. But I don't really know what I'm longing for or missing. I can't say what it is because I don't really know, its just kind of what I feel it's like?(the afterlife) and I never really felt like I belong among people because I feel so different, not in a bad way but I prefer being alone and have a really hard time talking to people or connecting with them. I feel like I connect with something else more. \n\nLike, I'm not suicidal at all anymore because I have a new kitten and he changed everything for me. I connect with him and other animals i just still have this constant feeling and desire to be \"back\" like out in the atmosphere or something, but not in a body. I don't want to die though. Like actually I'm super terrified now of dying and it's now something I completely hope does NOT happen anytime soon. Because I want my life with my kitten. I'm really excited about that. \n\nI kind of just typed a bunch of stuff without even remembering what subreddit I'm on so I apologize if I went off topic lol but I feel like it's got a paranormal vibe to it, the whole longing feelings. I just wonder if anyone relates at all to that. Or if anyone has any information about that stuff, I. Looking through the flairs and there are so many flairs that I don't know what they mean so that kind of makes me wonder if my experience is something more than just feelings.\n\nAnyways if you do happen to reply to this please don't be mean or sarcastic though,thank you haha",

        "text": "By \"ether\" I mean the \"other side\" of things nobody seems to want to talk about. The spirit realm, the astral plane, psychosis, and so on. Based on what I've read, talked about with people, and seen myself, that side of reality seems pretty strange, but the things we all experience are pretty similar.\n\nI really think the whole terminology we use to describe this world is pretty unsatisfactory. To say these things exist in another realm is too dissociative. I don't think there's any real separation between this world and that world, and there never was. The true barriers between your perception and any part of that world, are your beliefs. If you can deconstruct your belief system, you can access whatever you can imagine and believe whatever you want.\n\nI believe we're a very small part of a massive organism. We live inside a living breathing organism that has a mind of it's own, and we all perform a function as a part of it's anatomy. The biosphere theory comes closest to my understanding. I say this because to me, the \"ether\" pulses and breathes as far as I can see. Everything follows some variant of this pattern. The wax and wane, the in and out, the beginning and end, inhale and exhale. There's a breath, and a heartbeat, and a connection. Sometimes an uncomfortable connection... \n\nThere's also tons of weird creatures floating and crawling around that are way more evolved and advanced than we are. Light, for example, is one such creature. Light is extremely clever, and really has a hold on our perception in ways we don't want to admit. The more I thought about light, the more everything else fell into place and I began to look out for the things that hide in it. Ugh it's really too crazy to keep going on about. I can feel them prickling my face through r\nthe very screen, for speaking about them so candidly.... Maybe they want to be known though. Maybe it's time we learned to accept them as a fact of life, and work with them towards a better tomorrow for all of us.",

        "text": "My wife and I have been together for 10 years, and she has recently started seeing and hearing things that, as far as I can tell, are not there. It started with music a few months ago, and it seemed to her to be coming from electronics and appliances in our home, such as the fridge, air purifier, furnace, etc. More recently, she has shared that she is seeing people in the neighbors backyard and even on the rooftops of houses in our neighborhood, as she and they watch a ghostly parade go by on our street. I've comforted myself with the thought that it is likely due to her sleep problems, as these experiences seem to consistently occur at night (hypnagogic?). That comfort is wearing thin, as learned today there may also be voices, and that she has felt threatened. Her mother knows about all this, and has she that SHE has heard and seen them too, so they're getting out the sage and thyme to ward off what they think is the presence of evil.\n\nCan two people be wrong about this? Her grandmother also has heard similar strange things and moved out of the city to escape it. Has anyone had or known someone with this experience? We have small children, so I am concerned for their safety, should this continue to get worse.",
