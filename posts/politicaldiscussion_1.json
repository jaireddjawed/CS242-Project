Despite this, the GOP pursued Obamacare repeal from 2011 to 2017, even though there was no possibility that it would have happened due to Obama's veto. The GOP tried to repeal the ACA in 2017 but narrowly lost due to Manchin, McCain, Murkowski and Collins voting no. Since 2018, the GOP has been quiet on ACA repeal. It wasn't a main campaign issue in 2020 and 2022, a stark contrast from 2010 to 2018.\n\nDo the GOP consider the issue of the ACA settled, and is a battle not worth pursuing, or are they keeping quiet and planning to revive ACA repeal when they have a trifecta?",

        "text": "Governor Ron DeSantis has been touted for months as a possible Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election to challenge Joe Biden. However, so far he has not yet made any clear indication that he will join the race. Furthermore, Trump has formally joined the race as of November, which means DeSantis would have to directly fight him in the primaries if he chooses to throw his hat in the ring. This is a risky gamble because Trump appears to have the ironclad support of about 40% of the Republican base, who will not abandon him no matter what.\n\n[Polling for the primaries has shown Trump consistently in the lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2024_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries#Nationwide_polling). Though to be fair DeSantis' numbers have been slowly rising.\n\n[Looking at statewide polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2024_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries#Statewide_polling), DeSantis seems to be doing better than Trump in the following states: Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia. Even if DeSantis were to win all these states, it would not be enough to secure the delegates needed to win the primaries.\n\nLooking even further into the general election, assuming DeSantis wins the primaries, he would have to peel off some blue states to win. [Using this map as an example, even if he wins all the traditional GOP states - including taking back AZ and GA - and wins historical swing states like FL and OH, *and* wins Nevada which has not gone red in decades, he would still fall barely short of 270 electoral votes](https://www.270towin.com/maps/mrD4w). He would need to not only pitch the perfect game above but also break one of the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states, or take another \"weak blue\" state like New Hampshire or two of Maine's independent districts. And on top of it all, this is trying to dislodge an incumbent which is traditionally very difficult. It seems like all the stars would need to align for this to happen.\n\nWhat is DeSantis' political strategy through the primaries? If he manages to win that, what is his strategy to get 270 electoral votes?",
