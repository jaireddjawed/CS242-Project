Her email address is [Name\\_Yukiko@Company.com](mailto:Name_Yukiko@Company.com) (the same company as me so I assume the addresses take the same form name-wise.) She addresses her emails \"Hello Christopher-san.\" (Even though I persist in signing myself \"Chris.\") That's fine. Her email signature is an auto one using our company's template and it says \"Yukiko NAME - Role\". (Capital letters her own.)\n\nIs Yukiko a given or a family name? Is she Yukiko-san or Name-san?\n\nI can't figure it out.\n\nThanks!\n\n​\n\n(Note: I'm using 'Name' as a placeholder for a name and 'Role' as a placeholder for our job titles.

I would like to try my hand at cell phone novels because the sentences are short, and the content is much more interesting. However, I am having trouble locating these two I am really interested in. \n\nI was able to find the Deep Love novel through the app store, but it won't allow me to download it b/c its \"not available in your country.\" I've used a VPN service to bypass this, but I can't download it without a credit card from Japan, and I don't want to spend $10.00 on a Google Play card to download free ebooks. \n\nI also found some links for 赤い糸 but I can't figure out which one is the full and original story.\n\nDoes anyone happen to know where I can read both of these (preferably) online (so that I can copy and paste sentences into Anki as needed)? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n(Also, hopefully this is an acceptable place to post this question, since it is being used for a resource for studying! )",

        "text": "Hello all, I've been using みんなの日本語 2nd edition for a bit over a month now, and I noticed a discrepancy in the way it puts some words in Hiragana vs Kanji. If you are familiar with the book, the opening pages of a chapter contain a list of vocabulary. Some of them include the Kanji as well as the hiragana, such as  \"時計\" (とけい)  and \"時々\" (ときどき). Later on in the chapter, the same words will be written in Kanji with furigana. These are all great. \n\nHowever, they don't do this for some other quite common words. For example, \"今日\"(today) is just written as \"きょう\" , \"明日\"(tomorrow) is written as \"あした\" only, \"鞄\"(bag) is just written as \"かばん\" only, \"一緒に\"(together) is just written as \"いっしょに\" throughout. Can anyone pinpoint why they do this? What's the logic behind these selections? This raises some concern on my part because, e.g., a Japanese friend told me that using \"きょう\" instead of \"今日\" in writing is extremely weird. Knowing this, I can't help but feel that I can't fully trust this book and from now on I need to look up each hiragana-only vocab presented in the book and see whether it has corresponding kanji.",

All was going well until Wednesday. So my Professor, who I will call Professor Sensee (PS for short), taught us the Hiragana alphabet using online resources which thought the calligraphy way of writing ‘ki’ and ‘sa’ so, naturally on my homework and all of my practice sheets that’s the way I wrote them. When I get my homework back, every ‘ki’ and ‘sa’ that I wrote had the connective loop section circled. We are allowed to do corrections to regain points so I corrected it by writing the same style neater because maybe it was too messy??  Anyway this keeps happening so I finally ask her what’s up. She tells me that writing  the calligraphy style characters is wrong and that’s why she’s taking points away from me. \n\nI have googled as much as possible on he subject (there isn’t much) but nothing Im finding is telling me this wrong, they’re just different. She tells me I have to write the disconnected forms of the characters because it’s closer to real Japanese handwriting which irks me because, with what I currently know, I’m not incorrect and she seems irrational with her grading decisions for something so arbitrary. \n\nWhat should I say to PS because I actually find the connected forms much easier to write and I am able to write those much more neatly than the disjointed characters? Also if there’s a reason why those characters became disjointed over time, why didn’t ‘chi’ become disjointed when it is a mirror image of ‘shi’ with the same stroke order?\n\nThanks in advance fellow Japanese learners :)\n\nEdit: I confused ‘Shi’ and ‘sa’. I meant ‘sa,’ my bad. \n",

Either free or paid is ok. \n\nThank you all!\n\nEDIT:  to give a bit of context, I am looking for an app that will allow users to make flash cards on the fly or at least save a list of words for later. I often encounter words in passing and I don’t have the time to write it down or make a flash card right then, but I end up forgetting it by the end of the day. ",
