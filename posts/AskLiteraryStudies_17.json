        "text": "I'm a literary layman, but I have read a few intro books on theory. (*Theory Toolbox*, Barry's *Beginning Theory*, and a \"for dummies\" book) So please understand I'm coming to you after having made some effort on my own.  And in fact, my interest in learning more about the various French and Frankfurt philosophy it uses, structual linguistics, and Freud were a good chunk of what interested me in it in the first place. \n\nI have to admit, though, I find it almost entirely inpenetrable. I can't even really tell you what I read, much less the purpose of it. Certainly this is not a flaw with theory; I believe a good amount of it is as much to due to the difficulty of the material itself as that I'm still stuck on trying to grasp how all those things I mentioned earlier even ended up being discussed in the same breath as literature, much less what it might do for us. I know I'm sinply not sophisticated enough to get it, but I'm still in the dark. \n\nAnyways, I don't want to ask anyone to write me a book on the topic; if it were simple and easy to summerize and explain, they wouldn't write textbooks about it. But man, I am very lost. Can anyone toss me a modestly-sized flotation ring?\n\nTL;DR: I tried to introduce myself to the basics of literary theory, and nearly got more confused the more I read. ",

This is hardly a flaw with classic literature; after all, that was the style of the time, but it certainly does present a certain barrier to those not already accustomed to it. \n\nFor instance, I actually read a decent amount of non-fiction from the 50-60s, and earlier, and while it's often still quite noticable there, I've gotten used to it. ~~On the other hand, I tried reading Dracula a few months ago and ultimately gave up; and I really wanted to read it too.~~ Actually Dracula's fine on these counts, it must have been the antiquated language usage that threw me off. \n\nAny older literature buck this stylistic trend?

But, Damon Albarn clearly sings *Virgil.*\n\nWould anyone happen to know what this is referencing from Virgil's works? I'm really curious to read the source text that this seems to be alluding to, but an Internet search turned up nothing for me.

Several other unnamed men are mentioned and presumably want to skive off, as they \"see the tiger while they was at work, and came running ‘ome to tell about it\", these might include Sam Jones, Charlie Hall and Jack Minns, all of whom are specified by Bob Pretty as amongst those who have seen the tiger.\n\nHowever, I can't see what motivates old man Parsley to say that he has seen the tiger going into Bob Pretty's house.

        "text": "[Original post from /r/cybertext](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybertext/comments/6b11ob/ergodicity_and_phenomenology_ma_dissertation/)\n***\nHi all. \n\nI'm an MA English Literature student writing a dissertation on Aspen Aarseth's concept: \"Ergodicity\". Now, although I'm very interested in games/game studies (played all my life, beginning to get familiar with the academic field) I am very much a novice when it comes to Game Studies. Obviously, Aarseth is influential in Game Studies, and to read all of the texts that reference Cybertext would be to read half the work currently in circulation in the field. Of what I have read (again, I stress I'm new to the field; nowhere near exhausting the material) it seems to me that most take Aarseth's word that Ergodicity exists as a phenomenon and don't really engage with it as a concept, focusing on the derivative, formal concepts: cybertext/hypertext/ergodic literature. \n\nIf (big if, your thoughts?) I can generalise this approach to Aarseth's text, then some sceptic can append any criticism that aims to build on Aarseth's approach with the following Kantian codicil: \"you are only dealing in representation; your concept has no condition for possibility\". I realise this would have been far from Aarseth's mind when he was formulating \"Cybertext\" (who's got time for this sort of technicality?) but I'm a bit surprised that this hasn't come up in any of the reading I've done thus far. Especially because the structures of experience necessary to explain the how and why of ergodicity can be found in some Pontian/Heideggerian literature (body image, skilful coping, Thrownness). \n\nSo, my plan was to show how and why ergodicity occurs in the relationship between user and game through these concepts, derive some aesthetic approaches this understanding allows, and try to explain some gaming phenomena with the newly clarified term.\n\nMy university faculty, although very learned and respected, does not have anyone who could be considered an expert in game studies. I was wondering if this base plan sounds possible and/or plausible. I realise I've given you very little to go on in terms of the plan; I'm not even sure at this stage what needs clarifying. Happy to discuss specifics further if anyone has particular criticisms. \n\nAnyway, some assumptions I'm making that I am currently unsure of: \n\n1) The approach I've described to \"Cybertext\" is common enough to be generalised for rhetorical purposes. \n\n2) Aarseth does not address the criticism I've described in \"Cybertext\" or any subsequent literature (I'll admit; read all of \"Cybertext\" a year ago, currently re-reading, little hazy at the moment. Very open to my reading being attacked) \n\n3) That what I'm proposing is original enough to at least by viable as a MA dissertation (I'm searched everywhere for key words, can't find anything addressing this. Again, very new, could be wrong) \n\n4) texts can be said to produce an \"ergodic response\" in the user typified by Aarseth's often quoted definition.\n\n5) Although originally a work of literary criticism, \"Cybertext\" is most commonly used to think gaming and game studies is its cosiest home academically. \n\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback on what I've said. If anyone could point me in the direction of criticism of ergodicity or \"Cybertext\" in general, that'd be great. \n\nCheers for reading, look forward to your feedback.  \n\nEDIT: incidentally, new to Reddit; I apologise if this is formatting in a clumsy/difficult way.

        "text": "A friend of mine and I both have degrees in literature, but we've long acknowledged marked differences in taste. Recently, he gave me Alice Thomas Ellis's 1996 novel *Fairy Tale,* describing it as one of his favorites, and I have to admit that I can't quite figure out why anyone would think it's a very good novel. \n\nEllis is obviously a good prose writer, but, to my taste, she editorializes far too much. I've always thought that \"show, don't tell\" was good advice in creative writing, but Ellis's impulse seems to me to be to explain everything her characters are thinking and/or doing. I understand that Ellis feels she's engaged in satire, but one danger of satire is simply coming across as a curmudgeon who's disgruntled with everyone. That's how Ellis comes across to me. Her satire of New Age thinking is good in places, but it's also an easy, superficial sort of satire. I lived in California for several years, and I could do better. I could satirize some of the darker aspects of New Age gurus, such as the ones who charge their followers tons of money for their services. It's not all innocent silliness. \n\nAs for the supernatural aspects, Ellis picks an old standard: Couple moves to the country to get away from the city and get back in touch with nature. Couple moves into old house with an unknown, dark history. Strange things happen. Strange things do happen in this novel, but they don't seem, in the end, to amount to very much. All the major characters leave, relatively unscathed. In terms of a modern take on this genre, I might compare *Fairy Tale* to Anne Rice's *Witching Hour* and find Rice's novel more interesting. I don't think Rice is a great writer, but at least she knows how to handle the genre. \n\nAm I missing something about Ellis's skill as a novelist? I can't find any aspect of this novel particularly impressive. To me, it seems like a mish-mash of impulses thrown together by a writer with strong opinions on a number of topics, but little interest in writing a well-constructed novel. In fact, in one interview, Ellis herself said that she doesn't write novels to a structure. She just makes it up as she goes. I'm afraid it shows. ",

There's many books quoting the quote, as first publised in \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\", by Robert Burton, 1804 ([Here](https://books.google.es/books?id=ascIAAAAQAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s) on google books, page 272).\n\nThe quoute itself says:\n\n*Another through bashfulness suspicion and timorousness will not be seen abroad, loves darkness as life, and cannot endure the light or to sit in lightsome places; his hat still in his eyes, he will neither sec, nor be seen by his good will* (Hippocrates lib de insanid et melancholia)*. He dare not come in company, for fear he should be misused, disgraced, overshoot himself in gesture or speeches, or be sick; he thinks every man observes him, aims at him derides him, owes hint malice.*\n\nDoes anybody know where can I find this?

In one of the poems we will be analysing there is an abrupt change in mood to the polar opposite of what was set up in the poem. \n\nThe mood of the poem throughout is one of uncertainty, torn between two opposite decisions to live or die, however the final two lines of the poem abruptly change in attitude/mood/language to certainty, the poet accepting his fate and carrying on. \n\nIs there a specific name for this poetic device or type of poem? The poem is 3 stanzas long, S1 is 6 lines long, s2 is 8 lines long and S3 is ten lines long. If it helps, the poem is \"I have a Rendezvous With Death\" by Alan Seeger.\n\nThanks in advance guys and girls, I realise this is really cheeky and I do appreciate your help :)",

Is it not Dorian's biased and self-disparaging image of his soul?\n\nIs the book that Lord Henry give Dorian that 'corrupts' him simply an extension of Lord Henry? If so, is the message here that people that are very sure of themselves easily corrupt those that are more pure and nuanced (if innocent and naive, as Dorian initially is)?\n\nIf the Portrait is Dorian's corrupted self-image or even the evilest parts of him (and not the best), does the fact that Basil's murder happen in its presence signify that we do the worst when we acknowledge our worst selves?\n\nThat Dorian doesn't even want the prey to die in the hunting part signify that he is greater in virtue than he appears to himself? \n\nDoes Dorian's death at the attempted destruction of the Portrait signify that we truly die as we attempt to destroy our self-image/ego?\n\nWhat does Dorian's good fortune (The death of James Vane, the acquiescence of the scientist in the hiding of his murder, the circumstances in which Basil had even come to his house) signify?\n\nMy friend said he thought that the book was a critique of the bourgeoisie. That Dorian's vanity and materialism was his own undoing. I don't really see that, but he has much more formal training in literary studies than myself. Is there any merit to this?\n\nWhat am I missing? What is the central theme of this book? I think it is that one must not be too quick to characterize themselves as a bad person or else that fate will come into fruition.

I was a Creative Writing major in college, and like many other aspiring fiction writers I sought out writing advice constantly on top of that, so I've heard the \"write every day\" mantra many, many times. It still seems like an essential part of becoming a better writer in my mind, but now that my interests have shifted from writing fiction to writing about fiction, I'm not sure how I can manage it, because I'm most interested in writing about novels. How I can I write something every day if I haven't finished reading the book I'm writing about? What can I write about a book that I haven't finished reading yet?\n\nSo I wanted to ask the members of this subreddit about this minor dilemma, and about that piece of advice in general. Do the assorted members of academia among you hold up \"write every day\" as gospel as well? And if so, how do you manage it? Or am I unnecessarily wedded to this ideal of writing daily? I know that I'll be thinking about and taking notes on whatever novel I'm reading as I'm reading it, so the earliest stages of writing are taking place while I'm reading the book. And I know that getting to know your subject matter is always the first step when writing nonfiction (as opposed to writing fiction, where you invent/\"invent\" everything yourself). It's just hard for me to shake my sense that I should be practicing writing as much as I can. Am I being dense about this? Any advice will be much appreciated!",

If it helps, I'm looking for a program that allows interdisciplinary work. \n\nWhere can I get started?",

Also, how does that text represent a societal construct like culture or social hierarchy, and class?",

        "text": "Hope someone can help. I don't have a background in post-WWII narratology beyond Todorov, Genette, Chatman and a few others. I'm tutoring undergrad students in a class on literary studies and have received a question from a keen undergrad about a line from the introduction to Mieke Bal's 'Narratology' (not a set reading). The student wants to know what is meant by this line: \n\n\"The amount of time which is allotted in the story to the various elements of the fabula is determined with respect to the amount of time which these elements take up in the fabula.”\n\nSo I'm new to teaching and I don't know Bal terribly well but I want to provide an answer. My understanding is that the fabula is the storyworld of the narrative, whereas story is the sequence of events as presented in the novel, the way the novel is organized — the plot. The story is a fraction of the fabula. My understanding is that time in fabula and time in story exist on parallel planes. But in story you can manipulate the time in the fabula — you can have summary, scene, etc. So, scene in story = real time in fabula. But summary in story is &lt; real time in fabula. Time in the fabula is chronological and replicates historical time, real time. \n\nCan someone help with the above quote on time? ",

He's not obscure or anything, yet I don't think I've ever seen him on a list of great works in the 19th century. He's a historical footnote, now.",

        "text": "I'm in the final semester of my undergraduate English literature degree and have begun to notice a pattern in my senior seminar course. The course is built around current trends in literary theory and deals heavily in Object Oriented Ontology, Ecocriticism, and New Materialisms. The trend I've noticed is that nearly everything we have read, from Bogost, Bennett, Harman, Cohen, Alaimo, and so on, all seem to ground their arguments in Latour/Callon's concept of networks.\n\nLatour is relatively new to me, he was never covered in my theory course, and I'm curious as to how influential he is in the current directions of theory/criticism. Is his popularity more isolated in the broad category of New Materialisms simply because he provides a framework to argue the agency/importance of non-human things, or has he been influential beyond New Materialisms?",

At one point, she thinks about her skeletally thin neighbor boy with disdain. The focus shifts to the neighbor boy who has to deal with very controlling parents who keep him working to earn points which he can redeem for meager treats--small handful of chocolate raises or some small amount of TV time. He witnesses the neighbor girl being attacked. Deals with internal conflict because of the way he's brought up to avoid conflict. Then deals with the external conflict of rescuing her from a would be kidnapper attacker guy.\n\nPressed for time when I read this story for a class, I gave it a quick read and called it good. Years later I can remember the bulk of the plot, but only a little of the narrator which I only remember as being interesting. Many of the literary elements are thin shadows in my mind that I can't fully recall but remember as powerful or interesting. I'd love to go back and give it a close reading. \n\nAir high five to anyone who can identify this! Thanks in advance!",
