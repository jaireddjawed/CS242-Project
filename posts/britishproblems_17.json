        "text": "Girlfriend’s got her heart on buying an Audi A3. With a baby on the way and I previously had one, she loves how practical they are.\n\nShe’s seen a few on Cazoo and Cinch but nothing that really caught her eye, but saw one she fell in love with at our local Audi showroom.\n\nWe went in with the knowledge their finance interest rates were unnecessarily high, 14% to be exact. So the guy turned around talking absolute shite to us.\n\n“We offset that interest rate though by offering a year’s warranty and so many years breakdown cover as well as £750 towards any excess if there was ever an accident.”\n\nThat’s all well and good, but six years ago when I bought mine from the exact showroom, on a much lower rate, they were also offering these as standard 🤨\n\nAnyway he went ahead, valued her Fiesta, offered her a good price, I said I was going to help her with a sum as well and he did the usual “let me go see what my manager can draw up for us.” They came up with a monthly price of nearly £500 a month. \n\nConsidering the same cars on Cinch and Cazoo are coming in about 9%, and £250 thereabouts a month, this was a solid no thanks. And I’m just about to order a brand new A5 at 5.9% coming in at much less per month too.\n\nI mentioned in front of them we’ll look at bank loan offers then that are currently in at 4.9%. Where the sales manager just laughed and said it wasn’t worth doing it like that. But made no effort to meet us in the middle either.\n\nWe got home and she priced up building a brand new one from the same dealership. £5,000 more overall, 10% and was coming in at £150 a month cheaper. How does that even work?\n\nI said we’ll go back and show them that then but she’s gone onto Cinch this morning and found a similar one coming in about £206 a month.\n\nUnlucky Audi. Don’t give me the usual sales pitch and then back out at the end. I wish there was a way of telling them they’ve lost a sale and proving we bought one elsewhere if their logic was that we couldn’t afford one or something so didn’t make the effort.",
