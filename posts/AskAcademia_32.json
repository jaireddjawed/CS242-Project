        "text": "Subreddits such as /r/IWantOut are full of stories of people who essentially left everything behind and moved to some faraway place that they always wanted to live in. I wanted to ask about a \"milder\" version of leaving everything behind, in an academic context, as one of the major benefits of working in academia is that one can straightforwardly get a job in a different country without having to leave everything behind.\n\nSpecifically, I got a PhD degree from the UK, and am currently working as a postdoc in a nice position abroad, with a good track record. Realistically, to have a chance at a successful career in my field, I would have to apply for a fellowship in some major places in America/Europe, and spend several more years postdocing before taking  a shot at some nice permanent/tenure-track positions, preferably also with some fellowship. However, there is a city that I fell in love with a long time ago, and I am convinced that I would like to live there -- the lifestyle, people, and culture there are significantly more appealing to me than anything I experienced elsewhere, and several recent visits have made me even more obsessed with it. To move there would severely limit my options for career progression abroad, but I could live a comfortable life in that country as many universities there like to hire foreign academics.\n\nI wanted to hear stories from academics who decided to prioritize location over career, and in particular decided to settle in a country without huge academic prospects, but one which they enjoy living in much more than anywhere else. I have talked to some friends who were in a similar situation before, but they all ultimately decided not to pursue such \"childish dreams\", so I haven't really heard any success stories. I'm curious whether there are any good experiences or if I'd be completely stupid to abandon my career like that.",

The flexibility to work on your own time is given but so much work is given that it takes really long hours. The work is really hard work with little time for thinking, reflection and inspiration which enables you to create good quality inventions and research. There's on and on meetings and extreme cutthroat competition. Whoever cannot stride through the fiery competition and falls behind are thrown off the program. \n* Hanging on strings: His PhD is on 4-5 projects and if he cannot do good enough work on all of them, he won't get funding for the next year. So the system keeps people anxious and on strings. \n* Having a bad PhD supervisor is life shattering: He says that if you have a bad supervisor and have a fallout, you need to start a PhD over again on a new topic/project. He says he knows a few people including a relative who had a fallout in the 4.5th year and had to drop out and not get her PhD and her whole 4.5 years went down the drain with nothing to show for it. \n\nNow, I am planning to do a PhD and what he said is obviously, a cause for concern.

As some background, I'm just in the process of applying for graduate programs in philosophy now and hoping to begin one next fall. I'm from the United States, and all of my education has been in the United States. I'm taking this year off after receiving my BA in philosophy last fall because I wanted to teach English abroad, but unfortunately I've had to cut that short for personal reasons, but I would like to work abroad again once I've started my career in philosophy. Given how competitive jobs for philosophy professors are, I'm trying to start preparing for future employment as early as I can, which is why I'm looking into this now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've read the posts I could find on the general topic of teaching at university abroad, but I haven't found anything about teaching philosophy specifically in these countries, especially in English. So, I'm not sure exactly how realistic or possible this is, or what special considerations there might be. To be specific, these are my questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How abundant are positions to teach philosophy in English in Asia?\n2. How does area of specialization affect one's prospects in these countries specifically? (I plan to focus on continental European philosophy, especially philosophy of literature and psychoanalysis. I'm also interested in the influence of existentialism on Asian literature, especially Japanese authors like Murakami and Soseki) How do opportunities to teach analytic, continental, and Asian philosophy compare?\n3. Are there any special considerations for networking? Again, I'm primarily looking into opportunities to teach in English. With this in mind, would I need to make a separate effort to network with academics abroad, or would gaining a reputation in Anglophonic academia be enough?\n\nI appreciate any insight you could give me into these considerations.",

Projects might change, your relationship with your advisor is paramount to your success.\n\n2. If the students in the lab and past students do not have many papers, that is an indicator that you will not have many papers.

I have a great job that isn't too demanding on energy or time. I also have a boss who is pretty flexible. I enjoy the work and I feel like I'm making a contribution, but I also feel like I can do more. I'm kind of hitting a rut in my career and want to expand my options. I noticed that the local university offers a PhD in education policy and I'm exploring the possibility of enrolling there.\n\n**About me:**\n\n- undergrad in math and master's in economics\n\n- wrote master's thesis about education policy\n\n- Canadian, no family obligations\n\n- senior analyst with ~7 years of professional experience \n\n**Why do I want the PhD?**\n\n- I want to solve a practical research problem facing the post-secondary sector (my job gives me access to a lot of administrative data that I'm hoping I can use for my thesis)\n\n- to give me more credibility and more expertise in the sector so that I can make a better contribution\n\n- to open up senior administrative leadership opportunities in government and possibly at universities later in my career (hopefully internationally too)\n\n- to open up the option of becoming a part-time lecturer\n\n- to make a contribution to the academic side of the field and potentially dabble in academia after the PhD\n\n- to network with people on the academic side\n\n- call me crazy, but I think I might enjoy the work. I'm kind of excited by the prospect.\n\n- NB: I'm not interested in a career in pure academia. Publish or perish is not for me.\n\n**Why a PhD in education policy and not economics?**\n\n- I want to work in education policy. Not economics. Though I will probably always consider myself to be an economist.\n\n- My background is more on the quantitative side and I want to build a more qualitative lens\n\n- The economics PhD requires 2 years of full-time in courses while the education policy PhD requires just 1\n\n- I'm tired of theorem-proof math and deriving economic models from first principles and I don't want to do it for another 2 years\n\n**Why do I think I can pull off this insanity?**\n\n- The PhD program appears to be built for working professionals - all classes are in the evenings or on the weekends\n\n- I know some people in my organization that have done a PhD while working full-time (but in different fields) which means that a) there is precedence that the university allows the work / study combo and b) that my employer has supported it \n\n- My job isn't too demanding and management is pretty flexible. I'll probably be able to do a decent amount of schoolwork at the office.\n\n- There might be some overlap between my work and the PhD program if I'm smart about it\n\n- I have no family responsibilities\n\n- I won't have any TAing responsibilities\n\n**Things that worry me**\n\n- I probably won't be funded by either my employer or the university; however, it's relatively low cost at around $6000 CAD per year (fees + tuition) and I can afford it.\n\n- I've never taken courses in education policy before. \n\n- I've read many news and magazine articles about the sector, but haven't read many academic journal articles.\n\n- My academic experience has been heavy in math and light in words. I didn't get the liberal arts experience where you have to read a lot of books and write a lot of words in a short period of time. \n\n- I have no publications. My MA thesis was not good enough to publish.\n\n- My GPA is ok. Not amazing. ~75% undergrad and ~80% MA. Never been a perfectionist about grades. My target will be to score 75-85% in my PhD courses.\n\n- Getting management to approve my use of administrative data for research will likely be a difficult process and I may run into conflict of interest issues.\n\nSo... Am I crazy for thinking I can do this? More importantly, is it worth the time, energy, and money? Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!",

        "text": "I'm a third-year Ph.D. student focusing on curriculum and instruction. The more time I spend in academia, the more certain I become that I do not want to stay in this field for various reasons (low pay, long hours, politics, hypocrisy...etc.). \n\nThe biggest reason is that I realized that I can't live off of an assistant professor salary. I'm willing to work long hours because I'm used to it, but I recently realized that the amount of salary contributes a lot to my job satisfaction. I want to start a family and not solely depend on my husband's income. \n\nSo I'm looking for an alternative career path here. There are three options that I've considered so far: 1) Consulting and then law school 2) Straight to law school or 3) Find a job as a product manager at an ed tech company. I'm willing to work long hours and under high pressure.\n\nGiven this, here's my first question. I know that people who hold Ph.D. in science background can easily transfer their skills and knowledge to law, but would that be possible for education background as well? If not, am I too naive even to consider this option of going to law school? \n\nMy second question - if I am considering these career options, should I finish the program and get the extra letters after my name? \n\nI'm really struggling to figure this out and your opinion/thoughts would be much appreciated. \n",

        "text": "I have been the only person managing my PhD advisor’s lab (combined organic chemistry and nano/materials) for over 1.5 years (since 1.5 years into my PhD) and most likely will be until the end of my PhD (another 1.5-2 years). It means that I communicate with suppliers and buy/order stuff (chemicals and other consumables, glassware, small equipment, office supplies… everything the lab needs except expensive instruments), try to get the supplier or someone to repair broken stuff, keep a spreadsheet of expenses and when something arrived or should arive, explain safety rules and other information to new members, try to get everyone to keep a minimum of cleanliness, organization and safety, and whatever else I can to maintain and improve working conditions in the lab. It’s necessary to keep the lab running, as my advisor works and travels a lot and hasn’t been able to hire a dedicated lab manager / staff scientist.\n\nI like it - I like enabling others’ research usually even more than doing my research. I am mostly good enough at this despite much of it being in a language I less than half-know - I usually do better than my advisor; sometimes I even do better than some native, full-time lab managers / staff scientists in other groups, because I care more. It usually takes me 10-20 h/week, and I am better suited for it than for teaching. My PhD is fully funded in any case and my school “pays” me for these additional tasks by letting me stay in subsidized on-campus apartment until the end of my PhD, which is great for me. But unfortunately I legally can’t permanently stay in this group (actually, country) after my PhD.\n\nSo, are these skills transferable to something I can do after my PhD? Are there academic or other jobs which this can notably help me get? To which country should I go for postdoc and what else I should do to become eligible for them? My top priority is to not need to commute or frequently travel, so I wouldn’t do well nor be well as a traveling sales manager or in much of typical industry.\n\nOr I need to beg/force my advisor to hire a lab manager and/or to let me be his teaching assistant for a semester (which I can’t be paid or further compensated for)? Or I will have to do another degree from scratch? And which?",

However, whilst I was hosting, I noticed I couldn’t help but be very self-conscious my pronunciation and accent in the presence of panelists and audience who spoke English with great flair, clarity and great articulation. Because I would focus on perfecting my pronunciation of most words and altering my accent (worst scenario would be to not have been understood for anything that I say), this made me stutter during the conference even despite weeks of practice. \n\nI was then wondering how then do some (international/foreign) professors manage to lecture so well without stuttering and with so much credibility, confidence and persuasion, even knowing that their accent might be different and run a risk of not being understood. \n\nMy question is to all professors/lecturers/academics who have been through and dealt with or experienced similar circumstances or anyone with a two cents on this issue. \n\nHave you ever felt that you have had to alter the way you spoke (accent-wise) in order to be understood or do you think that accent (and/or pronunciation) doesn’t matter much as long as content of material are delivered and that we confidence?

That being said, I'm curious how much this is going to damage my chances of going to Grad-school and if it's severely, if there is anyway to recover.

        "text": "[Original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/8y0m22/left_off_of_author_list/)\n\nIn my last post I told a little tale of being left off of a publication recently that involved several years of my life during the beginning of my PhD. People offered a variety of perspectives and opinions about how to proceed, which was super helpful and thank you all for taking the time.\n\nHere's a quick update - The committee member who left me off of the author list reached out to me to inform me that the paper had been published. I didn't immediately respond, and instead I consulted with a few folks involved in the paper to determine if I was somehow missing something that I had done or not done and it seemed like they were more or less sympathetic and on my side. And of course, I posted on reddit, because why not get the opinion of internet strangers - most people had suggested keeping things diplomatic and investigating authorship corrections with the journal. A week or so passes before the committee member reaches out to me again to see if I want to chat (I think spurred by my primary advisor) and we end up finding each other in the hallway. We chat for about half an hour outside where I lay out my reaction and she promises it was an honest mistake and that there was absolutely no malice or politics involved. She was working as hard as I was to keep things diplomatic and to keep bridges unburned, there was a hug involved, which I appreciate, so I took what she said at face value. She apologizes and accepts blame, which is heartening except that she views the additional steps to be limited (basically, \"move on and sorry!\"). I bring up that author corrections are a thing (thanks for the suggestion AskAca!!) and she seems very doubtful, but willing to explore the possibility... the least she can do to make things up is to have my back in exploring the idea.\n\nFast-forward a month or two and she has reached out to the other lab group and the main author has taken the lead on contacting the journal to initiate a correction. Every author eventually agrees in writing and now things are 100% copacetic, I'm on the author list! So basically long story short, things turned out well after a few hard conversations. Just wanted to write a quick update and thank everyone for offering some opinions and perspectives. I'm honestly shocked and disappointed that not a single person in my department thought that author corrections were possible, so now I can tell my advisor that my reddit addiction has had a tangible positive impact on my career.

But I'm still finding that I'm having trouble in my supervision meetings. I'm not opposed to case studies, but I think for some things quantitatively analysing a larger data set can provide more veracity, and reveal additional insights. But I can't even find a way to articulate that to one of my supervisors without him getting outraged by I guess a feeling that I don't take his research methods seriously. \n\nI realise this is somewhat of a vent, but why is no one in this field of research open to quantitative research methods? Even basic industry analytics work done primarily by people with just a bachelor degree often incorporate data sets of 100-5,000, and I know the professionals working in the industry I'm studying make their decisions based on some similar data.

Is there a better way to go about finding an article that is in a journal that I don't have access to? Any help would be much appreciated!",

        "text": "  \n\nHi folks,\n\nI'm using a throwaway account and trying to keep this as vague as possible for privacy reasons. \n\nAs per the title I am one third of the way through my PhD have been offered what amounts to my dream job in industry. Unlike a lot of posters here, I very much enjoy doing a PhD and the lifestyle that comes with it--I have great advisors, a good work/life balance and for a variety of reasons will probably graduate with above average prospects on the academic job market (not that that counts for much!).\n\nHowever, a month ago an opening for what amounts to my dream job in industry came up. This job is exceptionally rare -- I have been monitoring job adverts for this for around 8 years and this is the only time I recall such an opportunity appearing in my region. Usually one would have to move to the capital city (which is 3 hours away from me) and go through the considerable toil of low-paid internships to even get an interview for a position like this. I had absolutely no plans of leaving my PhD but I was uniquely qualified for the job because of the nature of my research, so decided to apply on the off chance. Much to my surprise I was offered the position a few days ago. This is exactly the kind of job I would be applying for after finishing my PhD, alongside academic jobs.\n\nI am now facing the difficult decision of whether to leave my PhD and pursue this opportunity. For me, it feels like a choice between security for the next few years that it would have taken to finish my PhD vs. taking something of a gamble on this, as the job is initially only for a year \"with a view to extending the position permanently\". I also feel bad for my advisors. They have invested so much effort and belief in me during this process, and without them I would not be in the position I'm in. One of them is trying to obtain promotion and having PhD students complete successfully is an integral part of this. I know in the abstract that I don't \"owe\" anyone anything, but this is making me feel bad.\n\nI'm really sorry that I can't think of a direct question to ask you all about making this difficult decision, but I'm wondering if anyone could weigh in with any opinions or reflections this dilemma sparks? I've read many great advice posts over the years on this sub and would really appreciate hearing what people think.\n\nA few more pertinent facts:  \n \\- I have not yet started fieldwork  \n \\- I am in the EU, funded by a government organisation  \n \\- I am in a non-STEM field  \n\\- If I was not doing this dream job, I'd want to be an academic \n\nIf you require any further information please ask away.  \n\n\nThanks!",
