I think her name is probably a reference to the band \"ABBA\" and one of their singers, Frida. Why?\n\nFirst of all there's the similarity of the names (Abi and ABBA). But also, at the start of the episode, Bing Madsen (the protagonist) listens to one of ABBA's songs, \"I have a dream\" ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-\\_X-XezEC8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-_X-XezEC8)). Which is a song that helps him cope with the meaningless existence he lives... until he meets \"Abi\".\n\nThere's also the similarity between Frida (from ABBA) and Abi. I took two screenshots : you will notice the same haircut, same eye colour, same facial shape. AND they're both singers. \n\nSo we got 3 coincidences :\n\n\\- Abi and Frida look very similar and they're both singers.\n\n\\- At the start of the episode, Bing listens to a song from \"ABBA\", to cope.\n\n\\- Then he turns to \"Abi\" who looks just like Frida AND is also a singer. Abi gives him hope and a dream for the future (which gets crushed into tiny pieces as we know)\n\nI haven't seen this anywhere so I hope I don't sound crazy lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Frida from ABBA](https://preview.redd.it/bbgh406dii2a1.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97222cd151f77204e9c13d4ac3c44e5c46a5e11a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Abi from Black Mirror](https://preview.redd.it/967gptxfii2a1.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fc741ba678628fa3842a57ec726dfb4baf2f8ad)",

This was in response to me saying at the minute there is no real a.i, it's just data-set responses or best guesses by the computer to your question. So it gets better over time at tricking people into thinking it's alive. \n\nSo what if in a black mirror episode it starts with a guy meeting a woman at a bar nothing unusual or unnatural just two people hitting it off. They spend more time together and move in together. It turns out the woman is a android or human / robot. The guy only found out due to the woman robot telling him after feeling guilty as it knew the guy thought it was weird people treating androids as real people. So the guy now has a dilemma in that he genuinely fell in love with this machine. The android tells him if he could not tell does it really matter?\n\nNow the caveat here is that this android was built by a unscrupulous company (think Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg love child.) The company has access to all this androids telemetry data, visuals, audio that kind of thing. Does the guy freak out and destroy the android or does he end up not caring anymore?",

When the cheating husband gives his wallet to the main character kid to buy the gas, and the condoms fall out of the wallet (secret condoms for cheating on his wife), the woman at the register who sees Kenny's condoms fall out knows the cheating man. When Kenny comes back up to the dude and gives his wallet back, the woman probably attributes the secret wallet condoms for being with an affair, but she probably assumes it's with Kenny. Which is yet another foreshadowing about the ending twist. \n\nI've seen a post about how the condoms falling out and revealing a picture of the married guy's kids was foreshadowing, but getting your condom wallet handed back to you from a teenage boy and having it nervously explained away as being a secret nephew was the big foreshadowing from the condom wallet. And foreshadowing about getting found out at the gas station too.\n\nGuaranteed when that dudes wife leaves him and chats with that family friend lady from the gas station, she's going to mention the condom wallets and everyone is going to think married guy is a cheater and a gay pedo too.\n\nsorry for the spoilers i dont know how to do that thing and it wasnt in the \"formatting help\" link",
