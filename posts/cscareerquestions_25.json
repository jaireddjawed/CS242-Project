I know that entry-level is extremely competitive at the moment, but I'm really starting to get demotivated. I have been learning front-end development for about a year now and I feel pretty comfortable with html, css, and js. I have some experience with frameworks and front-end libraries, mainly Three JS and i've been trying to learn react.\n\nI just don't know what I can do to improve my chances of finding a job. One of my weakest points is that I don't have a portfolio setup. I would love to spend a month or two building some projects for it but money is tight and I spend too much time job searching to really do this atm. I feel that I have the skill level to handle an entry-level position but I have had a very difficult time even finding them on sites like indeed and linkedin. There are basically 0 positions in my area (i live in a slightly rural area) and from what I understand it can be hard to find remote entry-level jobs.\n\nDo you think it is possible for me to find a job at my skill level? Plan B would be to just find some part time job for now while I build some portfolio projects, but I would really just love to get into the industry right now if I can. Any help would be appreciated.",

Dallas is obviously more affordable and seems to have more to offer in terms of city amenities. However, hiking in Dallas sucks, and there is not a whole lot to do outdoors.

In the syllabus, it states that many Java features, such as applets, GUI programming, Java Server Pages (JSP), etc., are not covered in the course.\n\nMy long-term goal is to get an internship after my sophomore year.\n\nWhat I'm most concerned about is what languages to learn that will help me secure an internship. I hear conflicting advice online: some say to only learn languages when the need arises (like if you're working on a project that requires a certain language) and to focus on one language, while others say not to be stuck to one language.\n\nI can't tell if my classes are enough to learn Java or if I should use an additional resource on top of my classes to learn Java. Data structures is also taught in Java too.\n\nFor example, we're learning about a special library concerning input and output, but some upperclassman tutors told me they never use this library, and some classmates said they use scanners instead of this library. I don't  know what scanners are, but they seem to be used more than this weird library for accepting input. Scanners are not taught in my class. I don't even think we will be taught what packages are.\n\nI just don't know what to do. Do I find outside resources to learn Java features not taught in class, or is my class knowledge of Java good enough, and I should focus on learning other languages? Thank you.",

It’s his first company and now he’s pretty frustrated and wants to resign asap and go to Bangalore or Pune(preferable Bangalore) \n\nIssue: \nHe’s planning to leave soon without having any job letter.( as he hasn’t appeared for any interview) \nBeing a bachelor and 32 yo. He has no responsibilities as of now. \n\nQuestion:\nPlanning to resign and serve 2 month notice period and post 2 months as he will have lot of time to prepare for the interview. This is his plan \n\nIs this the right move to take this risk. ? \n\nGenuine and helpful answers only.\n\nNote-\nHe has made up his mind but not sure about the jobs as it will be his first switch, spoke with him and he said he needs time to prepare for the technical interview and skill up.\n\n\nThanks",

Please let me know if this should be in a sticky thread instead. \n\nI graduate in June with a BS in computer science. However I don't feel like I have retained all that much, I struggle with learning disabilities that affect long-term memory storage and recall. I know enough to be very good at researching and re-learning things I've seen/done before even if the knowledge only really sticks while I'm actively using it. That being said, it makes it really difficult to find a direction and I need to find work in something. My goal has always been work-life balance, I don't want to burn my passion out on my job, I want to enjoy it but it shouldn't be my life. \n\nI am a degree switch, I struggled to find an area of study that I enjoyed learning and didn't end up hating. The problem-solving aspect of cs is very enjoyable and I've absolutely been excited and gone overboard on a few assignments during my time. I loved my microcontrollers and 3d modeling classes and databases were fun. Currently finishing a network security class which has been interesting. But I don't think I want/can go the developer route like my peers. I feel like the more I experience the less I feel that I am capable of in a CS career. But I still want a direction and goal to work towards even if it takes me longer than others. I just don't know what that should be or how to grasp figuring it out.   \n\n\nTLDR: I struggle with conceptualizing and committing learning to memory due to learning impairment. I don't feel capable of a development career in cs. What might the options be that don't leave me in dead-end jobs for the rest of my life? I still want to grow and learn new things. I don't hate cs by a long shot it's just really hard and I would like to be a good employable candidate for something.",

I took a Full-Time internship with Trimble in Cloud Operations, where I was offered a Full-Time position to return as a Site Reliability Engineer. I am now working full time while taking 1 or 2 college classes per term on the side to finish my Bachelors. I have been working the position for just under half a year, and I am very happy with the position! My team has been supportive, I have been exposed to very relevant tech stacks, and (so far) I have been unaffected by the tech layoffs (very thankful for this!).\n\nBeing my first position as an engineer, however, I am fairly lost on how I should pursue my career development moving forward. A few specific areas I am looking for advice:\n\n* How should I handle career development for the first few years? I have frequent touch points with my manager where we discuss job growth and eventual promotions. Is this sufficient? Any additional recommendations?\n* How can I make the most of my remote position? I am spoiled for choice on where to live and where to travel, but I have 'no' clue where to start. lol\n* Any general advice for a new engineer! What are some tips you wish you had year 1?\n\nI appreciate any feedback that is offered! Very happy with my current position, just a little lost in the opportunity. Hoping a few more experienced engineers might be able to help put some direction behind my feet.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I don't really know where else to post this or who to talk to about this because I feel like most people aren't going to understand my situation. I got a job straight out of college, worked my ass off for seven years working full time and going to school. Got out with just 6k in debt and paid it off during my first year of working. \n\nThe first thing that I noticed after getting the job was it was nothing like they had told me it was going to be during the interview process or on the job description. I was told that I'd be doing automation with a development team but ended up doing automated testing for a QA team.\n\nIt was fine, but it definitely peeved me a little because I had very little to no guidance. I was the only programmer on my team and I had no one else to really bounce any ideas off of or anything. So I basically had to just slam my head against my keyboard in order to get anything to work. \n\nThere are also absolutely ZERO best practices being conducted during my development process. It's basically just write automation scripts all day as fast as you can with no thought into the design, reliability, reusability or modularity of the code. The only measurement that my work is based off of is how many scripts have I automated during that week.\n\nI feel like a code monkey where all I do is just type and code all day. Granted, it has gotten me a lot better at typing code quickly and designing stuff on the fly but it's discouraging to know that my work is most likely an afterthought.\n\nNow tech is taking a dive in the market. Half of my team got laid off and the rest of my team was disbanded. The worst thing about that was I felt as though I had contributed to my coworkers getting laid off since I had automated a lot of the work that they were doing.\n\nI'm now on a completely new team working on a completely different part of the tech stack and I'm just so discouraged and done with this job and I'm not even 2 years into it. I've been interviewing but have had little luck as there is quite a lot of people looking for new positions currently.\n\nI had one offer from a company that I'd have to move out of state for and take a significant pay cut but would be more secure and more of a developer position. I turned it down because the pay was so much lower than what I currently make but I'm not sure if it was the best decision.\n\n I feel as though I'm just a pawn in this game of chess where the rug could get pulled out from under me at any moment for little to no reason at all. I'm trying to ignore that feeling and just do the best work that I can but man it's difficult. \n\nI'm not sure if this fits this subreddit or if this is even something anybody would be interested in but I just had to get it off of my chest. This is not what I thought this job was going to be at all.",

        "text": "I know this question has probably been asked a thousand times, but I think my situation is a little different. I graduated 2021 with a BA in Psych, ended up not using it to pursue anything meaningful and have been doing part-time work. Decided after more than year to go back to school for a 2nd bachelors in computer science. I tried looking for a masters in Miami, since I don't want to leave and dorm with someone, but couldn't find any that didn't require either years of experience or a related bachelors.\n\nI looked into WGU, and it's relatively cheap but I'm not the best at self-studying or the most self-motivated person out there that I know, realistically, I'll take longer than I want to. At FIU, they have a BA and BS in CS, which I think the BA is the route I'd go since it requires less courses.\n\nI also have a potential scholarship from my government that would pay off my tuition if I pay for and complete the first semester (at least 12 credits) of a program and get a good GPA, I think 3.5 or so. It has a monthly stipend of around $1.8k. Downside is, it only applies to on-campus programs.\n\nSo I have two options:  \nGo to FIU and pay off the first semester which would be around $3k, get good grades, and hope I get the scholarship after applying. Might take 1.5-2 years or less depending on if I can do more than 30 credits a year. I also plan to work, either part-time or full-time, at least until I am able to get the scholarship.\n\nEnroll at WGU, apply to whatever scholarships I can find, and try to complete as many courses as possible within the first 6 month semester. My goal with this method would be to finish in a year, but like I said I tend to lose focus and motivation every now and then, so I might struggle with this method. Also no real professors or networking opportunities, but it results in a degree + certs.\n\nIn case this matters to going for a BA or BS, I'd want to eventually go into the game industry but I'm also interested in a variety of careers in CS such as UX/UI research/design, Software Dev, Web Dev/Design, Software Engineer, etc.",

All new hires go through a 90-day training program, with full pay and benefits. However, I have been in an interview process for a database engineer position with a local software development company. The company specializes in AI machine learning software to help manage transport logistic inventory, seems like cool stuff. They have also let me know to expect an offer letter this week.  I currently am working towards my Bachelor in computer science, and expect to complete it fall of this year. I have worked in data oriented IT positions in the past, so I am familiar with SQL as a user, but not as a developer. I will go over the positions and some of the pros and cons to further elaborate on the dilemma. Both jobs pay about the same so in the short-term money is not a factor. Also, I am a father of 3 girls and play a very active role in their lives, being home everyday to spend time with them is very important to me. \n\nI am currently training in the call center position, and it doesn’t seem too bad now. The pay is good and the benefits are fantastic. From what I can tell there is a good prospect for career advancement as well. Having spoke to a few managers, they told me after I finish my bachelor they have an in house career path to transition people to their software development department. This being said, it will take at a minimum a year before I can begin that process, as one cannot transfer departments for 9 months after training. So, it is very up in the air how soon before I can begin a career at this company in software development. Another negative is the hours, I will be working from 11 to 8, with Wednesday and Thursday off, not ideal for my family. After 9 months I will have the opportunity to change shifts. I really have no interest in working in a call center, but it seems like it could be a good company to grow my career with. \n\nThe database engineer position seems like a great opportunity, but I have also noticed a few red flags. I would like to work in a more data oriented position, as that is what I currently have experience in, and I enjoy it, and being able to get a position like this before I finish my bachelor seems like a great opportunity. The company specializes in machine learning software to automate tracking freight through video. They were initially incorporated in the 90’s so have been around awhile.  My first two interviews went really well, and they made it seem like a great position. It is an hour drive each way, but it is a hybrid position, with me only having to be in office three days a week, potentially 2 days after I have been there for a while. Also, it is a traditional 9-5 m-f, which is great for my family life. So, lets get into some of the red flags. The posting I applied to advertised for a paid internship position, which I believed would be a good fit as I have database experience but no degree. By my second interview I determined there was some mistake in the posting. I interviewed with the VP, and she stated that there was some kind of breakdown in communication regarding the posting. However, I emphasized my background and experience level just to insure they did not set expectations of me higher than they should. Overall, this interview went really well regardless. I then had a third and final interview with the CEO, and that was…interesting. He did most the talking, however I was able to get a few words in edge wise to sell myself. What was disconcerting was how he made sure to highlight how they have let go of one or two new hires for not meeting expectations. Big red flag to me. Also, dude kind of seemed like a d\\*\\*k. Though he was the CEO and that is not too out of line. Also from what he said he seemed to be involved in the development process, but in an expecting regular updates kind of way. Lastly they did mention they are starting the process of being acquisitioned, but part of the deal was the new company would keep things in place how they currently are \n\nTL;DR\n\n**IP Company** \n\nPro:  Benefits \n\nCareer advancement\n\nAlready have job\n\nClose to home\n\nCons: Terrible work-life balance\n\nCall center position\n\n1-?

        "text": "I'm trying to build a roadmap of languages for me to learn in the future and would like to ask you to rate my map, 1-Go back to camp, 10-Stay fueled it's a highway.   \nIf you're making your own roadmap and would like to share I'd very much like to hear what you're up to.  \nBest wishes!\n\nI want to one day be a business making entrepreneur, to upskill and build someone into their dream. To do this I'm planning on taking a long trek and imagining this dream a reality around 10-20 years. Time isn't a problem, a river doesn't form from one storm. I want to go from making small programs and one day creating pipelines that can expand easily while keeping overall work light. If I can I want to expand big enough to be able to build my own servers with my own uses, and build up further if possible with mainframes. It's unlikely to get that big but it's a nice thought. Most of this is only theoretical as I'm trying to plan out my future, if you like my idea and want to talk further about where you're at or if you're planning on doing something similar or even not alike I'd love to read your plans for the future.\n\nMy current roadmap is:\nFirst 4 years:\n• Python - Major\n• R - Statistics/graphs\n• SQL - information development\n\nAfter 4 years:\n• Golang - scalability and server-side\n• Rust - secure and fast, becoming popular in both Microsoft and Golang\n• COBOL - security/development and scalability\n\n\nFirst 4 years:\nMy first 4 years are what I want to learn first and early, they will be ones that expand from and become the main chunk of what I do.\n\n• Python - I want python to be my main language for most of my projects. it'll be for the small programs and most of the independent work. The reason I want to use python as my main is because it is easy to work with and becoming popular, paired with its modulbility allowing it to do much more with its modules make it a very good general workhorse.\n\n• R - Specializing in analytics for maximum customization to graphs I want this language to act as my specialized computing brain. Rather than use pythons modules I'm taking the harder route to have another programming language and one that's very useable.\n\n• SQL - Learning this would I feel would let me keep standardization, it's also another language I want under my belt.\n\nAfter 4 years:\nThese are what I want to learn in the far future, things that will really just add a hint of polish to my projects.\n\n• Golang - This I will pair with python to make more scalable python projects, I also want to add servers and the cloud to my list of skills and Golang seems to be going that direction.\n\n• Rust - The main reason I'm wanting Rust is because of its reliability as well as being comparable to C, Rust is also supported by Golang and is planned to be adopted by Microsoft so it's a pretty nice language to know.\n\n• COBOL - I'm not 100% certain on COBOL, it just seems really neat to learn and what seems to me to be a more advanced SQL for bigger projects.\n\nThis is my primary roadmap for a lot of what I want to do. \nI have a focus on popularity and scalability, in a way I feel pretty lucky these traits two can match up so nicely in a lot of the future languages.  \nI'm planning on 4 year periods, there's no reason to keep to the schedule strictly so it's not absolute in progress only what's planned.  \nI will also be learning other extensions or directions outside of this group such as web development or further in data analytics with graph making and what I'm personally excited for when I get reliable access to the internet is beautiful soup and scrape web sites for a note collecting project I have that helps me learn new subjects.  \n\nDo you have a similar roadmap? if so what makes you take that direction?\nDo you have a story you'd like to share about your progression? \nHow would you rate my roadmap? 1-10, roast me :)\nWould you like to recommend a specialized program that helps even with other professions related to freelance or a hard skill worth learning?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, I hope to hear from you, have a wonderful day!",

        "text": " Hi y'all,\n\n\\## TL;DR: Aerospace engineer with \\\\\\~5 years of work experience, \\\\\\~1 of which is in a data engineering-type role. Looking to make a career move in about a year to a backend SWE or data engineering role. Mostly done with an MS in CS and wondering what else I can do to boost my resume.\n\nI'm in the middle of a planned career switch from aerospace to backend software engineering or data engineering, and I'm wondering what I should do to boost my resume. Also wondering if I should be applying to entry-level roles or roles that ask for a few YoE.  \n\nMy overall goals are to set myself up for long-term success in tech, work on interesting products, and increase my TC. I live in the Southeast US but am pretty much exclusively looking for roles in Washington DC or Boston (or full remote) to be near family.  \n\n\\## My relevant experience:  \n\nI'm currently eight classes into GA Tech's OMSCS program and should finish in December of this year. I'm pursuing the Computing Systems specialization but have also taken some ML classes. My favorite classes so far have been Operating Systems and Robotics AI.  \n\nFor the past \\\\\\~year I've worked at a defense company. We receive time-series data from our customers after each of their missions from sensors on air vehicles. My group develops Python code to translate data from different customer formats to databases used by customer service and the rest of the engineering department. We also develop analysis routines in Python that calculate certain engineering parameters and track data trends for anomalies. This has given me experience in Python and some light experience in AWS and database work.  \n\nOther than those two, I've played around in Python a bit on some personal projects, but nothing too crazy. Mostly just some basic projects: visualizations of my Spotify listening history, some image processing, and some Flask development tutorials.  \n\n\\## Less relevant experience:  \n\n• B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from GA Tech  \n\n• First job was in hardware analysis (finite element, manufacturing planning), so not too relevant  \n\n• Second job was in systems analysis. This gave me some coding experience, but it was mostly in MATLAB and Modelica, so not in a \"real\" SWE environment  \n\n\\## Anyone have any thoughts to share or a similar story?",
