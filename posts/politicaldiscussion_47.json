Critics argue this sort of fining would be abusive to the well-to-do.\n\nMight this objection be offset by strict limitations by statute: say a maximum 10-fold increase?  For a basic traffic fine:  a minimum wage worker is fined $60; the maximum fine is $600.\n\nAdvocates for the poor argue that high traffic fines unfairly burden low income people; the U.S. Justice Department cited traffic fining patterns as a factor in the 2014 racial unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2014/08/25/343143937/in-ferguson-court-fines-and-fees-fuel-anger\n\n&gt;Quote: \"For those living on the economic margins, the consequences of even a minor criminal violation can lead to a spiral of debt, unpaid obligations, unemployment and even arrest.\"\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/us/ferguson-missouri-racism-tickets-fines/index.html\n\n",

        "text": "Trump and his administration have been underwater in popularity according to the polls since he became president. While much of it is due to Trump's own actions and commentary, especially on Twitter, there is little information about how much of his problems have been exacerbated by the competency or lack thereof of his own staff, notwithstanding he picked many of them himself only for them to be dismissed later on.\n\n​\n\nTrump by all accounts was and is inexperienced in politics, especially DC politics, so to have a successful administration, he needed a staff that would implement his ideas into workable and hopefully popular polices. His ideas on trade, immigration, crime, the military, health care, government spending, etc. were at best incomplete on the campaign trail and needed refinement when his came into office. Trump himself said he was more of a \"big picture\" guy, not a details guy, so that any idea he brought up needed to be translated into politico-language for it to be implemented correctly.\n\n​\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n1. Was the outrage over the travel ban in early 2017 due to Trump's campaign promise to exclude Muslims from the country or the rushed nature of the actual policy which cause confusion at airports?\n2. Was the failed vote over the Obamacare repeal due to Trump's wishy-washy statements about supporting the repeal or the White House not coordinating w/ Congress on a passable replacement bill?\n3. Was the illegal immigrant child separation fiasco due to Trump's harsh words aimed at Latinos or DHS and the DOJ not comprehending the likely outcome of a \"zero tolerance\" policy of prosecuting the adults who came w/ children at the border?\n\nHow would you assign the blame in these and other cases and if the White House had run a tight ship would the outcomes be different from a public's perspective? Would that translate into higher job approval than Trump now gets?",

However, there has not been as much commentary about the Romney-to-Clinton voters, who have traditionally been a mainstay of the GOP suburbs since Reagan. What news we do know about them is they were mainly turned off from Trump personally, even if they agreed with most Republican issues before they voted for Clinton.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow many of these Romney-Clinton voters has Trump won back? Alternatively, how alienated are they from the current GOP that they have either switch party registration to independent or Democrat? Would you describe them as NeverTrumpers or not? How will their voting behavior affect the 2018 midterm elections? Will they still back the Republican candidate if they can demonstrate distance from Trump's style of governance or are they looking to punish the GOP for embracing Trump?",

        "text": "According to [this article](http://www.knoe.com/content/news/Louisiana-asks-the-Supreme-Court-to-limit-LGBT-protections-491900241.html), Louisiana along with 15 other states are calling upon the Supreme Court to overrule the 6th Circuit Court decision that protects LGBT people under the Civil Rights Act.\n\nHere is also a [link](http://media.graytvinc.com/documents/Amicus+Brief.pdf) to the Amicus brief on this.\n\n\n\"A brief filed Friday asks the court to rule that it is legal to fire someone for their sexual orientation or gender identity without violating federal workplace discrimination laws. They argue the ban on sex discrimination in the civil rights act doesn't extend to the LGBT community.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment Louisiana's Attorney General Jeff Landry's said, \n\n\"We joined several states in urging the Supreme Court to correct the 6th Circuit’s error in expanding the meaning of “sex” under Title VII. When Congress enacted Title VII, virtually every dictionary definition of ‘sex’ referred to physiological distinctions between females and males, particularly with respect to their reproductive function.\n\n The 6th Circuit, however, took it upon itself to re-write the law to its own liking. This is not the proper role of the courts, and we urge the Supreme Court to reverse this ruling and reaffirm the proper balance of power among the branches of government\"\n\nThis seems to be the major reasoning for this action by these 16 states. \n\nSo will the Supreme Court take this case? How should we expect the Supreme Court to rule, and what will be the ramifications of that ruling?",

        "text": "Although not universally true everywhere in America, a large portion of revenue generated from driving infractions is kept and used by local governments and law enforcement agencies.  But is this an optimal use of the money generated?  Does it create an incentive for these governments and law enforcement agencies to be too strict on their ticketing, and/or raise the fines for infractions?\n\n[Alternatively, there was a proposed ballot initiative this year in Colorado, that would have forced law enforcement agencies within the state to give all money generated from ticketing to charities within the state.  All told, it would have reduced government revenue by over $200 million a year. Some argued that is a good thing, as it would disincentivize local governments and law enforcement agencies from being so strict on ticketing.](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/revolutionary-bill-will-remove-incentive-for-profiteering-cops-by-giving-all-fines-to-charity/)\n\nIs there an optimum way collect and allocate revenue generated from fines?  Are there any issues with the way we do things now?",
