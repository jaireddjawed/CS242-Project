That being said, I have some questions. \n\n-  What is the job market like?\n-  What are the biggest challenges that the country faces in terms of planning?\n- Are most employment opportunities found in government, or is there a lot to be found in the private sector as well?\n- How are salaries? (especially at entry-level)\n- If you have worked abroad, how is your experience/degree seen?\n- Any advice you have?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

        "text": "**Question: I want to write a book, and I'm  wondering if you think there needs to be a certain level of achievement before it's worthwhile, or if status matters at all.** \n\nHere's why I ask: I've only recently (last 4 years) come into the world of planning. Prior to that, it was almost all politics. I got an english degree as an undergrad because its an area where I have talent and I wanted to be a speech writer. Around 2007 I started working on local campaigns in which municipal concerns were paramount and things like \"how do we deal with a landfill approaching capacity\" and \"fix the potholes before talking about getting a stadium\" were regular topics. That basically gave me the bug, and I just recently got a Master's in Sustainability wherein my focus was on green buildings and community design. \n\nI want to write a book that's probably a bit too extreme to actually be implemented, but I thought it might make a great conversation to get all comers involved in the issues of resource management and cities. (merge the suburbs, create new major cities in states, use regional rail to create an interconnected web).\n\nI'm wondering if, as someone who doesn't work in planning, nor do I have a PhD, it's worth doing? I feel as if the general impression would be \"who the hell are you?\" And, if I do write it, should I come at it from one angle over another? I guess I have proxy PTSD from reading about Jacque Fresco. \n\nAny thoughts or advice you can offer are welcome. ",

I know that there are dynamically priced express *lanes* on highways where they take one lane and price it to eliminate congestion, and it seems pretty good although I would want to learn more about how that impacts pricing- if you apply the dynamic pricing to the whole road capacity, theoretically that should lead to much lower average congestion prices, although at the expense of eliminating the congestion-charge-free option.",

The neighborhood wants to foster this growth and give the street a more welcoming feel to pedestrians while putting in traffic calming measures. \n\n\nThe question is, what are your thoughts on putting roundabouts on a main street? Any insight from someone with knowledge on roundabouts or any opinions would be great. \n\n\n\nEdit: Traffic lights",

And i think a smaller firm would be more southing for me at the moment. unfortunately It's hard to find the smaller bureaus in a city where you don't speak the same languages or share the same media platforms.

Things such as the role of parks in the city, Beaux-Arts architecture on civic institutions and the role of these buildings in neighborhood placemaking, etc. If anyone has any input on what books I should look for I'd greatly appreciate it.

        "text": "As someone living in the American South who's not an urban planner (I'm a biomedical engineer by training) but who's lived in enough urban places to know what popular and effective transit systems look and feel like, I'm always looking for opportunities to have more, better use of buses in my area.\n\nHowever, a lot of people in my community (Research Triangle region, NC) don't feel the same way -and I want to pick y'all's brains about what could be done about this.\n\nThe obvious, purely logistical problem is that buses feel unreliable, are inconvenient to base your life around, and confusing/anxiety-inducing to use (read: route planning, scheduling, and poor implementation of UI/UX principles for a smoother riding experience). These, as I understand it, are technical issues involving funding limitations and/or poor execution -and as much as I respect them and think they're important, I'm **NOT** here to talk about that.\n\nInstead, I want to talk about the social and psychological reasons.\n\nA big fraction of people who use American buses depend on them due to their socioeconomic backgrounds; that's a pragmatic thing that I completely understand. However, (for a lack of a better way to put it) I often notice people during my midday bus rides or around rush hour at bus terminals who seem/smell/sound like they might have better places to be.\n\nI personally don't mind them being around as long as their conversations aren't bothersome or the music being blasted from their phones aren't loud enough to hurt my ears, but most people I know don't seem to be as nonchalant about this...\n\n...and I fear that image is what's truly keeping a significant number of Americans from taking buses over cars. Improvements to and logistical creativity (such as bus-only lanes and BRT) doesn't really seem to matter at the end of the day. **This perception that buses are a social annoyance is what I often hear as one reason why people don't use or like them.**\n\nWith this said, **what do you think is being/could be done to address and improve this emotional stigma against buses?**\n\nI don't care for further analysis unless you think I'm addressing the wrong need; I'm here for solutions.\n\nEDIT (Jun. 9, 1:10EDT): clarification of certain parts, stylistic edits.",

I want to keep my questions pretty straightforward because I know you planners are busy.  \n\nWhat type of jobs/job titles can urban planners take with private sector engineering firms?\n\nMore specifically, As a professional with \\~5 years experience as a Mechanical Engineer (mix of design/sales, w/ BS in Mech Eng) pursuing their Masters in Urban and Regional Planning?\n\nWhat type of positions, and firms would find my combination of education and experience most valuable? \n\nAre there any niches in urban design that I could fit really well into? \n\nLastly, I haven't taken the program yet, and could focus/curtail the MS program (GIS,environment,transportation,etc.) What do the professionals here recommend from experience I consider?\n\nAll input is highly appreciated.",
