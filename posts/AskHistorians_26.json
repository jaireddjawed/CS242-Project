        "text": "So, artistic renditions of ‘burning at the stake’ seem to exhibit a considerable degree of variation. Often the victim is depicted as being bound to an upright stake with a fire subsequently being lit beneath their feet ([example](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.catholicworldreport.com/2022/10/witchburning_sm1-678x381.jpg)); other times a reclining victim is seen tied to some sort of wooden frame, which is then hoisted up before being allowed to fall into an already burning fire ([example](https://blogs.letemps.ch/garry-littman/wp-content/uploads/sites/216/2020/10/Witch-6-750x410.jpg)). In the fictional *The Fall of the King* by Johannes V. Jensen, which is set in mid-16th century Denmark (although this particular execution takes place in Lübeck), a man accused of witchcraft is chained by the waist to a stake on top of a tall pyre. When the pyre starts burning the chain appears long enough that he is able to ‘*jump about in the fire in a most lively fashion and dance across the burning planks*’. I’ve never seen this particular method described in any other piece of media.\n\nWere these differences in any way meaningful? Did the exact method of execution depend on the status or gender of the accused, or perhaps the specific crimes they were charged for? Was there regional variation involved? Or was it all solely dependent on the whims of the executioners?",

I’ve known since elementary school about how the border between Texas and Mexico was determined to be the Rio Grande, and the borders between Arizona and New Mexico from the Gadsden Purchase. However, that leaves one section of the border without a solid explanation for me. I’ve never quite learned how the border between the U.S. state of California and the Mexican state of Baja California came to be determined. I’ve seen from one source that this boundary was set in 1804, when both were under the Province of Las Californias under the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and that the now modern boundary set after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was set slightly north of this, which I assume was what the source was referring to as the “Palóu Line.” I also heard that the modern boundary was supposed to go from the confluence of the Colorado and Gila Rivers to the Pacific Coast. Despite this knowledge, I’m still missing a lot of the historical background and the context of why this was the case, and I have been unable to find any good, in-depth sources on this particular issue. How was the 1804 boundary determined, and how and why was the modern boundary determined to be what it is today, and why didn’t it just reuse the old 1804 boundary?",

        "text": "For those who don't know, Shelby Foote, one of the main people interviewed in the iconic Ken Burns documentary The Civil War, recalls a story where Robert E Lee went out of his way to return a union POW's stolen hat. I did find a [19th century source](https://books.google.com/books?id=NK0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242) that recited a supposed Union soldier's letter attesting to the event, but actual date of the publication was 1889, and it the whole thing was basically about how awesome and glorious Robert E Lee was. So yeah, I'm not entirely satisfied.\n\nWatching the show as a wee history buffling, I readily absorbed its theme of simultaneously recognizing slavery's central role in the war while also glorifying certain leaders on both sides, but times have shifted, and with it the image of Lee as an honorable general who just so happened to be one of the bad guys. The hat incident in particular interests me, because while there is plenty of evidence that Lee was just as racist as other confederates and that he still sorta kinda broke a basic military oath to the Union, the hat incident and other stories like it (such as him compensating ~~looted~~ requisitioned union property with admittedly worthless confederate cash) still leave open the interpretation of him as having *some* sort of rigid moral code, even if it still allowed for secession and totally omitted blacks. (As opposed to no moral code whatsoever, or a dogmatic psychopath like Stonewall Jackson)",

Lately in my casual reading I’ve been kind of astonished at how old quite a few scientific concepts are. Years ago I used to read about how Nikola Tesla was ahead of his time including with some text that we still don’t fully understand today. \n\nToday, a discussion on Reddit prompted me to research the history of virtual reality, and I learned that the concept was demonstrated as early as 1960 in a format similar to what we have today. Growing up in the 80s, I felt like my culture fed me this idea that we were living on the bleeding edge. Imagine my dismay  realizing 30 years later that we still don’t have most of what Epcot told us we would have. And yet, most of that stuff had working prototypes already.  Electric cars, with their silent drive and incredible acceleration, have existed for longer than gasoline cars, yet most of us see them as a brand new concept today. Air fryers have recently taken American kitchens by storm, but apparently are a redux of a product that flopped in the 1980s. \n\nThat has me wondering, what forgotten technologies of the 20th century or perhaps even earlier are we missing out on that could make a comeback and change all of our lives? Is there a real thing like the imaginary water powered car conspiracy theory where the best imaginable product already exists but simply hasn’t been brought to market? \n\nI think this question is really directed toward, if there is such a thing, a historian of technology. Freeze differently, I’m wondering if there were promising technologies in bygone days that were seemingly abandoned despite having promise that we might expect to see come back in the future. Back in the future ha I guess that reminds me, whatever happened to freeze dried food? “mom sure can hydrate a pizza“ did not hit the 2015 vernacular somehow. That might be a concrete example, a technology that in the 1980s looked inevitable but never really met the market.",

The other said that ships going up the African coast would have to go out to sea further because of the ocean currents and some of these would have saw the coast of Brazil. Both of these, especially the second one, seem dubious and ive never saw a more serious source beyond a professors anecdotes so I'm wondering if there is any validity to them.

        "text": "In looking at the Russian Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union, I am struck by the divide between actions and rhetoric even in the first few years of the new government. The Bolsheviks, much like many of the socialist parties, talked a pretty appealing political game from what I can tell including universal suffrage, national self-determination for the minorities inside the Russian Empire, and a variety of freedoms. And IMO it is easy to see how a rather nice democracy could have formed with a chain of soviets going from local to regional to national levels. \n\nObviously, almost none of that happened. It became a one party dictatorship, those minority nationalities, if allowed to become their own state, became mere puppet states, and political repression was intense. And while someone could potentially say that desperate times during the Russian Civil War called for desperate measures, it only got worse as time went on AFAIK. What went wrong? I have several theories:\n\n1) Lenin and the Bolshevik leaders were naturally authoritarian and dragged the nation in that direction, unable to see the contradiction of what they preached vs what they did\n\n2) The leaders had wanted a revolution for so long that once in power they couldn't imagine anyone else guiding the nation toward a communist vision so they made sure it could only be them. (Although maybe this is really the same as 1)\n\n3)The Bolsheviks implemented a variety of emergency measures to survive the Russian Civil War that got \"rooted in place\" so to speak so that even when it was over, the repression remained. Or in other words it kind of spiraled out of control and they found themselves kind of dragged along by the inertia of their actions?\n\n4) Similar to 3, the Bolsheviks implemented a variety of measures to hold onto to power until the more widespread global proletarian revolution, and when that never materialized they kept up the repression to ensure Russia would remain communist and could act as the vanguard for the global revolution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there any evidence or writings to support any of these theories? Or really any writings or musings by party officials about the divergence of rhetoric and actions?",

Many of these photos are famous and instantly recognizable even to me. (I am far too young to have lived through any of the events the song references.) However I know very little about the events and people they depict, and I don't know anything about why **these photographs in particular** became famous. Wikipedia points to Nguyễn Văn Lém and Lee Harvey Oswald, but it says nothing about the rest.\n\nHere are some of the questions I have.\n\n1. What's the historical context, or \"big background\" setting, for the moments these photographs depict? What is the world they took place in? How faithfully do these photos represent that world?\n2. Why these photos in particular? What about them is interesting to, say, an art historian or media theorist (these two disciplines are arbitrary examples, I'd love to hear from any discipline's lens), and how did these photographs become so emblematic of an entire era?\n3. Their featuring in \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" argues this set of photos is a chronicle/distillation of the time period covered by the song. How reasonable of a framing is this? What's the value and function of a \"photo-essay\" in history?\n\nFor ease of reference, here are the relevant timestamps from the video: [0:47](https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g?t=47), [1:27](https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g?t=87), [2:12](https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g?t=132), [2:44](https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g?t=164), [3:22](https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g?t=202).

Were there any earlier iterations proposed or pushes for a similar bill to protect those with physical handicaps?",

        "text": "There is a popular conception and portrayal of isolationist policies among communist countries during the Cold War. I'm wondering what the extent of this isolationism entails. Certainly, politically, the Soviet Union intervened in many places around the globe and China infamously intervened in Korea. Economically, they certainly had a preference for publicly/government-owned enterprises, but how difficult is it really to conduct business with and within these countries? What about scientific pursuits? How willing were these countries to pursue joint scientific projects with other countries? And finally, how much of this isolation is self-imposed vs. imposed by western democracies?",
