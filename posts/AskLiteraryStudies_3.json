However, most of the papers come from mid or low-tier journals that aren't very well known. Most of the papers were also written by either graduate students or professors in Pakistan.

For reference, I'm thinking about the \"thrumbing to wildness/luxuriating in profusion\" poster floating around fairly recently from an older conference panel. \n\nWhat do you all think?

        "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nThe title mostly says everything you need to know to answer the question. I'm wondering if the Language poetry movement and its post-structuralist criticism is still an ongoing debate in academia. Critics like Helen Vendler, Marjorie Perloff, and Lyn Hejinian come to mind, but my department at least doesn't bring them up. I ask because I'm interested in the intersections between metaphysics and poetry and I find these critics satisfying in that regard.\n\nThanks in advance for any answers.",

I simply wanted to make a post about facts from the literary world that I've discovered and hoping you can share some of your own discoveries. Biographical curiosities, little trivia, oddities, etc. All related to books, writers, poets, literary movements and all that. Here are some that I know:\n\n* Roberto Bolaño's novella *By Night in Chile* (2000) was originally going to be titled *Shit Storms* (\"Tormentas de mierda\") but fellow writer Juan Villoro convinced Bolaño otherwise.\n* Ismael Kadare's novel, *The Palace of Dreams* (1981), about an authoritarian regime that steals people's dreams and dissects them looking for information that may help the sultan, was denounced by the writers union in Kadare's native communist Albania just two weeks after publication but by that time the book was already sold out.\n* Vladimir Nabokov self-admitted a prejudice against women writers, particularly saying he disliked Jane Austen's work. That is, until he read Austen's *Mansfield Park* (1814) and liked it so much he decided to teach it in his literature course.\n* Eino Friberg was a Finnish-born American translator. He lost his eyesight when he was 10 (an accident regarding a glass bottle of soda). He loved *The Kalevala* so much that he decided to translate it into English at age 75.  It took him 13 years to do so but when it came out it was so acclaimed that Fribeg received Finland's highest literary honor (Order of the White Rose).\n* When he was a young man, Victor Hugo admired Chateaubriand so much that in one of his notes he wrote \"I will be Cheateaubriand or nothing.\"\n* Ernst Jünger used to experiment with LSD alongside its very creator, Albert Hofmann.",

        "text": "Hello guys, I enrolled literary studies without any previous experience and knowledge (My previous education revolved around engineering mostly). As a part of my final exam, we are given a short fragment (of a novel, for example) and our task is to analyze it in terms of Narrative, Characterization and Language. What should I focus on primarily? (Example of a passage from Orwell's \"1984\").\n-\nIt  was  a  bright  cold  day  in  April,  and  the  clocks  were  striking  thirteen.  Winston  Smith,  his  chin  nuzzled  into  his  breast  in  an  effort  to  escape  the  vile  wind,  slipped  quickly  through  the  glass  doors  of  Victory  Mansions,  though  not  quickly  enough  to  prevent  a  swirl  of  gritty  dust  from  entering  along  with  him.  The  hallway  smelt  of  boiled  cabbage  and  old  rag  mats.  At  one  end  of  it  a  coloured  poster,  too  large  for  indoor  display,  had  been  tacked  to  the  wall.  It  depicted  simply  an  enormous  face,  more  than  a  metre  wide:  the  face  of  a  man  of  about  forty-five,  with  a  heavy  black  moustache  and  ruggedly  handsome  features.  Winston  made  for  the  stairs.  It  was  no  use  trying  the  lift.  Even  at  the  best  of  times  it  was  seldom  working,  and  at  present  the  electric  current  was  cut  off  during  daylight  hours.  It  was  part  of  the  economy  drive  in  preparation  for  Hate  Week.  The  flat  was  seven  flights  up,  and  Winston,  who  was  thirty-nine  and  had  a  varicose  ulcer  above  his  right  ankle,  went  slowly,  resting  several  times  on  the  way.  On  each  landing,  opposite  the  lift-shaft,  the  poster  with  the  enormous  face  gazed  from  the  wall.  It  was  one  of  those  pictures  which  are  so  contrived  that  the  eyes  follow  you  about  when  you  move.  BIG  BROTHER  IS  WATCHING  YOU,  the  caption  beneath  it  ran.  Inside  the  flat  a  fruity  voice  was  reading  out  a  list  of  figures  which  had  something  to  do  with  the  production  of  pig-iron.  The  voice  came  from  an  oblong  metal  plaque  like  a  dulled  mirror  which  formed  part  of  the  surface  of  the  right-hand  wall.  Winston  turned  a  switch  and  the  voice  sank  somewhat,  though  the  words  were  still  distinguishable.  The  instrument  (the  telescreen,  it  was  called)  could  be  dimmed,  but  there  was  no  way  of  shutting  it  off  completely.  He  moved  over  to  the  window:  a  smallish,  frail  figure,  the  meagreness  of  his  body  merely  emphasized  by  the  blue  overalls  which  were  the  uniform  of  the  party.  His  hair  was  very  fair,  his  face  naturally  sanguine,  his  skin  roughened  by  coarse  soap  and  blunt  razor  blades  and  the  cold  of  the  winter  that  had  just  ended.  Outside,  even  through  the  shut  window-pane,  the  world  looked  cold.  Down  in  the  street  little  eddies  of  wind  were  whirling  dust  and  torn  paper  into  spirals,  and  though  the  sun  was  shining  and  the  sky  a  harsh  blue,  there  seemed  to  be  no  colour  in  anything,  except  the  posters  that  were  plastered  everywhere.  The  blackmoustachio’d  face  gazed  down  from  every  commanding  corner.  There  was  one  on  the  house-front  immediately  opposite.  BIG  BROTHER  IS  WATCHING  YOU,  the  caption  said,  while  the  dark  eyes  looked  deep  into  Winston’s  own.  Down  at  street  level  another  poster,  torn  at  one  corner,  flapped  fitfully  in  the  wind,  alternately  covering  and  uncovering  the  single  word  INGSOC.  In  the  far  distance  a  helicopter  skimmed  down  between  the  roofs,  hovered  for  an  instant  like  a  bluebottle,  and  darted  away  again  with  a  curving  flight.  It  was  the  police  patrol,  snooping  into  people’s  windows.  The  patrols  did  not  matter,  however.  Only  the  Thought  Police  mattered.",

        "text": "I am a philosophy student and I am planning to take Directed Study in order to study philosophy and literature. However, after talking to my proffesor, he said that such a discipline is nobody's main interest and if I wanted study this area, I needed to come up with a syllabus. If I do this, he will accept to guide me. So, I want you to suggest me novels. To illustrate better, while studying To The Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf, I will also study Henri Bergson and Erich Auerbach. Sorry that I am vulgarizing what I want to say since I am at the airport and I do hope that you help me. Thanks!",

This was heard by the priest Gyojaku when he was in Kyoto. It is information to be treasured.\n\nNow, I don't know if this is intended to be sarcasm or if they had a pressing need to skin heads at the time and this was a problem that needed solving a lot or if there's some allegory wrapped up in this.\n\nBut what the fuck does that mean?",
