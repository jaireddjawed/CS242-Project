It seems most recipes want you to leave the crawfish in sub-boiling water for 40 minutes or so. That seems like a long time to me, given that you can boil a whole lobster in 15 minutes. \n\nAre there any Serious Eats-style tests of low country boil techniques? Do I really need to put ice in there and let things sit around? Is the only reason to add all that spice to the water because not much of it actually ends up on the food, [sort of like marinades](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/marinades-and-brinerades/science-of-marinades-and-brinerades/)? Can I just put salt in the water and shake other spices on after everything is cooked and drained? Would steaming be better/more efficient? How long does it actually take to cook a crawfish properly, and does any spice at all penetrate the shell?",

For me it’s been astonishing how fast it assimilates and assembles every piece of information. It’s not enough to ask for a recipe to a specific plate but if you understand the thought process of the program itself you can have it find almost everything, most of the times correct and very to the point. Sometimes, not many it gives results that don’t make that much sense so you prove around a little bit more and very soon it will correct itself.\n\nI thought more than being a tool to gel you get through college in a breeze, as a tool of knowledge and assembly of said knowledge it worked really well and I think it can have a big impact on cooking …\n\nAny thoughts ?",

Even better is that the local library had it available. My wife gives me that \"sigh, I married that\" look for chuckling out loud at it. Yesterday I picked up the inexpensive $3 version on kindle to have access to some of the recipes suggested for little hands.\n\nIts pretty normal for me to take the lazy way out during evenings and throw something on the tv.

        "text": "On instagram, Stella posted a maple variant of her marshmallows where she replaced the sugar with maple sugar and the corn syrup with maple syrup. I want to try this but maple sugar is a specialty product that I'm having trouble finding (and I'm in Canada!!). Plus, it's really expensive. I read that maple sugar is just boiled maple syrup that is then crystallized, so my question is: can I just use all maple syrup and omit the granulated sugar altogether? What purpose does the granulated sugar serve in the recipe vs. the syrup?\n\nIf it is important to use a form of granulated sugar in the recipe I am considering using toasted sugar or demerara sugar (though not sure if that would be an ok sub due to molasses content?)",
