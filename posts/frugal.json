The past few weeks have demonstrated that this one-day \u201cbonanza\u201d of haul\/find posts can create meaningful conversation and quantifiably causes a positive impact on engagement throughout the subreddit. That being said, many individuals have expressed concerns regarding the quality of these postings and their relevancy\/overall contribution to the community. \n\n**So what\u2019s changing?**\n\n**Post Titles**\n\nStarting this week, all hauls or finds which involve savings, prices, or something purchased should include the relative location in the title. Post titles should follow this format:\n\n* \\[Location\\] Rest of Title\n\nThis does not impact salvage finds, roadside finds, or other \u201cunique\u201d situational hauls.\n\nWe don\u2019t want anybody doxing themselves and we want everybody to be comfortable when posting, so you are welcome to keep the location relatively ambiguous. However, it should be identifiable enough that it allows for users in a similar area\/lifestyle to compare prices. Examples of titles include:\n\n* \\[Rural New York\\] Rest of Title\n* \\[Auckland, New Zealand\\] Rest of Title\n* \\[Eastern Suburban France\\] Rest of Title\n\nPlease remember, not every post you see on r\/Frugal will be directly applicable to you and your specific circumstances. **This is okay!** However, please be respectful of other users and \u201ckeep on scrolling\u201d if you feel a post irrelevant to you.\n\n**Contributory Top-Level Comments**\n\nIn conjunction with the post titles requirement, all haul and find posts should include a substantial top-level comment which expands upon your image contribution. This comment should be designed to promote discussion with other users. While this has always been an expectation as part of Rule 6, haul posts will be held to a stricter standard. While this process will be initially enforced manually, it will eventually be automated and all image posts will require a top-level comment within a specific period of time before going live in the main feed. Below are some suggestions for items which can be included\/discussed in a top-level comment:\n\n* For grocery hauls, the top-level comment can be a breakdown of the receipt\/item prices, discuss the justification\/reasoning behind specific purchases, or include tips\/suggestions you used be more frugal with your grocery purchase.\n* For roadside finds or salvage hauls, the top-level comment can include a breakdown of how you found your haul, how you intend to use your find, etc.\n\nThese recommendations aren't a hard and fast restriction, they're simply intended to serve as inspiration for your post.\n\n**As always, you're welcome to ask questions or provide feedback below!**","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675962017.0},{"title":"I was about to order a pizza but made one instead","author":"VapeDrinkWork","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/b9e93h180hna1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678679570.0},{"title":"Addicted to ordering food (DoorDash, UberEats, etc)","author":"gbcarie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11pf3xi\/addicted_to_ordering_food_doordash_ubereats_etc\/","text":"I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic, I\u2019m currently 30 days clean. \n\nOne of my strategies going in was to eat a bunch of food when I wanted to drink. \n\nIt\u2019s working, don\u2019t get me wrong but holy shit is it expensive.

Then they donate those to their local food bank.  \n  \nObviously check with your local food bank first, but my understanding is that most are thrilled to get those kinds of non-food donations, as their client base needs that stuff too, and people don't think about it when making donations.  \n  \n(Other stuff that some foods banks are also thrilled to get that people don't think of are paper bags and cardboard boxes.

What are you continually buying, and why is it so critical about it that you can't just buy enough on a big shopping trip, and have enough of a stockpile until that next big shopping trip that necessitates you getting it in a week or less from amazon?\"\n\nOr what is that consumer item, be it clothes, or electronics, or whatever, that necessitates that you be constantly buying it?\n\nNot to say that I don't want to buy anything.  I do, but there's no actual requirement or need to actually buy it.  I can understand the want to upgrade hardware and electronics that can add utility to one's life, but I don't understand other things like clothes.\n\nI go crazy, just wanting to buy new socks, but they're black socks, and I already have lots of black socks that look nearly identical to the socks I already have.  I have a capsule wardrobe and laundry is super easy.  I have a set or two of clothes that I could wear, but I prefer to just have them sit in the drawer with new tags, because I get more utility out of having 'nice new clothes in the closet at the ready', vs wearing them and not having the 'joy' of them being new anymore (hedonic adaptation), and then buying another set of clothes to 'feel good' about.  This avoids the 'so many clothes, but no idea on what to wear', and the many other 'paradox of choice' problems.\n\nI just want to spend money and have new things, just for the sake of having new things, and not even wear them.  Same thing when it comes to 'to go coffee'.  I'm not even thirsty.  I just see everyone with a coffee cup, so I want one too simply just to be 'part of the tribe'. So I understand the \"drive\".  But in the end, no one really cares what I wear, or what\/when I drink, so there's little point to buying anything 'new' unless I actually need it.\n\nWhich has me at the point where I've already bought everything I wanted or needed, and it's all quality, or exactly the level that I need that I don't need to buy anything better.  I literally have it all.  Even if I go to Best Buy and see the 84\" 4k TV, I shrug my shouders.  The content I watch is 720p youtube videos, and I don't find it interesting to watch 4k videos of fireworks or fishtanks.  To paraphrase r\/headphones, \"I don't listen to headphones with music, I listen to music with headphones.  If the headphone is good enough to listen to my music, I don't need another headphone to listen to the same music 'better' or 'different.\"\n\nI'm not interested as most consumer goods seem to be in a post technological boom.  Even the latest innovation 'Airpods' have $14.99 versions available to the most low level of consumers.  It's incredible\n\nWhich is all to say, we literally can get everything we want, and even the lowest level of consumer goods can be very good if you just take a little effort in taking care of it.\n\nI've lost that 'drive'.  So if you still have that 'drive', what is it, and what are you buying, and how is that different from someone who isn't the r\/frugal type?","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678655786.0},{"title":"Don\u2019t forget about shoe horns","author":"Illwarthog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11pyx4v\/dont_forget_about_shoe_horns\/","text":"Get a shoe horn folks.

In January 2022, the figure stood at only 12%. The overall number of British children suffering from a lack of food has now reached almost 4 million, data showed.\n\nThe alarming trend comes as the country suffers from record-high food inflation, spurred by soaring energy costs. The indicator now stands at 17.1%, according to the latest figures released by market researcher Kantar earlier this week, with milk, eggs, and margarine showing the fastest price growth. The cost-of-living crisis is further exacerbated by the government\u2019s recent decision to cut back support for household energy bills.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678363868.0},{"title":"Is Alibaba a good frugal alternative?","author":"goldcat88","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11om18k\/is_alibaba_a_good_frugal_alternative\/","text":"Has anyone used Alibaba and had a good experience?

Slow cook 8 hours on medium while beans are soaking.\n\n4. Blend the stew until chunk free and adjust spices to taste.\n\n5. Put everything into the pressure cooker (or slow cooker), add water to cover if needed, and pressure cook for 45 minutes (~7 hours on high for slow cooker) or until beans are soft and ham is fork tender.\n\n6. Remove lid and heat on high to simmer while stirring occasionally until desired thickness. The beans will absorb more water and thicken the stew further as it sits and cools so you may want to undershoot if you plan on leftovers.\n\n7. Served alone or made better by white rice and bread.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tips:**\n\nThe cayenne and smoked paprika drive the flavor in this dish, so adjust them first if you aren't satisfied. I'll also specifically recommend La Dalia smoked paprika because that's what my mom uses. It's a very easy to tweak and modify if you want something different; just some of my experiments:  \n- hotter spices  \n- saute vegetables  \n- sweeten with carrots  \n- chicken\/sausage\/roast beef  \n- chicken broth, beef broth, vegan imitation broth, vegetable stock  \n\nIf you need a meal in a hurry you can also pressure cook the entire thing:  \n- pressure cook the veg for 30 minutes or until mush  \n- blend  \n- add the meat and pressure cook for 30 minutes or until half tender  \n- add *rinsed* canned pinto beans and pressure cook for another 15 minutes  \n- simmer down  \nI don't personally recommend it because the flavor isn't as rich and canned beans aren't as good as the dry ones. \n\nFor anyone barely getting by this is about the cheapest thing you can eat every day and not die. There are some ...unfortunate... side effects to eating beans for multiple days in a row, so I'd recommend alternating this with 2-3 other meals. It refrigerates re-heats very well so you can make a double or triple batch if you need to. The prices I listed aren't even the cheapest because I normally shop at Aldi's instead of the Hispanic grocery where everything is cheaper. I also didn't include spice prices, but you can get them in bulk from Hispanic groceries or online pretty cheaply.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678418628.0},{"title":"Where do you live and how much is a rotisserie chicken?","author":"ls3095","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11n95mw\/where_do_you_live_and_how_much_is_a_rotisserie\/","text":"Where do you live and how much is a rotisserie chicken?

But I know there is a gurdwara (Sikh) near me I could go to almost daily and they will have meals. I'm lucky that my apartment is very well situated but a lot of these places are on or near bus lines.\n\nI am not religious by any means, but I do l love and support that aspect of different communities doing what is right. There is at least 1 church near me that I know I could turn to if I lost the roof over my head, just based on some word of mouth and the sign outside they change weekly with different thought-provoking messages.\n\nAt the end of the day, you should do what you are comfortable with. I have a friend who would never set foot in a Christian church again for personal reasons. I wouldn't expect him to put himself through any kind of discomfort (or a relapse tbh). But I feel like he could benefit from other places if they are willing to help. \n\nYou deserve help too.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry that there is a lot of overlap of those of us live in poverty and those of us who either want or need to be frugal.

I just want to tell you about a strategy to save LOTS of money. I hope this is useful to you in this time of such high inflation. Warning: it's long!\n\nBefore I get into it, this is a post for Canadians. The program is only available in Canada (as far as I know). It\u2019s called PC Optimum and it covers  [all these stores](https:\/\/lclcallcenters.my.site.com\/PCoptimumsupport\/s\/article\/Which-stores-are-participating-in-PC-Optimum-Points-Days?language=en_US).  Sorry to Americans :( I think there are a lot of Canadians on this sub...\n\nI also want to state that I only use this at the grocery store \"Maxi\" which is in Quebec. However, the program covers the whole of Canada. My mother uses the same strategy at No Frills in Ontario. I sometimes use it at Esso but I rarely use my car so don\u2019t buy a lot of gas. There is also Shoppers Drugmart\/Pharmaprix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI earned just over 450$ of real grocery dollars (in the form of points) from the summer of 2020 to today with this program. It\u2019s a lot of work (and it took a lot of work for me to fine-tune the strategy!), but that\u2019s also a lot of money! (It would have been more had I understood this system from the start.)\n\nWhat you need to make it work at the level I\u2019m at now:\n\n\\- A family, because you need to be able to make large 200$ single transactions. If you have a large household, great. You'll have less work to do.\n\n\\- A freezer, because you need to be able to buy multiples of items that freeze well and can be used up within two months, like bread (unless you have a larger family and can easily buy 200$ worth of groceries without having to freeze stuff!)\n\n\\- The meticulous personality of a frugal grocery shopper. This is really the key. If you're already someone who hunts grocery deals, scans multiple grocery flyers every week, you can easily get where I got with this program.\n\nAlso, let's be clear: this is a company rewards program. They want you to be their client and they\u2019ve made a client out of me because I do most of my grocery purchases with them now. However, you can be smart about what to buy and how to buy it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s the system in 6 steps:\n\n**1- Get the card.** If you are not already a PC Optimum member, there are often promotions for new members, so there\u2019s a bunch of points to get you started. When I got the card, I think there was a 10 000 points promotion, so 10$. 1000 points = 1$. (Beware: this is not the same as the promotion for a *PC credit card*. I\u2019ve seen up to 100 000 points promotions for that card. Don\u2019t fall for it - or any promotions on credit, ever.)\n\n**2- Make some small purchases with your new card.** Say, 15-20$ worth. I can be stuff from the flyer. Or stuff you need that you wouldn\u2019t get for cheaper elsewhere. You don't want to get \"had\" by the program, so cross-checking prices is important throughout this strategy (see point 4). But **let the program get to know you** by always scanning the card for each of these small purchases. This also tells the program it *could* get you to buy more because you're not buying a lot.\n\n**3- Watch your email** (you've associated it to your card). If you\u2019ve scanned the card for small purchases, the program will try to find a way to get you to spend more. Then you\u2019ll get a \"buy 200$ of groceries and earn 20 000 points\" promotion by email. The email will come, trust me, but it will probably take a few weeks. **The strategy is based on this recurring offer.** It will keep coming over the months. Sometimes it takes three weeks, sometimes 2 months . Keep your eyes open. This is how I\u2019ve earned the majority of my points. 20 000 points = 20$. 20$ can grow into hundreds over time.\n\n4\\*\\*- Keep a list of things you could buy but don\u2019t\\*\\* ***need*** **to buy right away**. This is essential to \"fill in\" an order to reach the 200$ you need to get the points. Look through your cupboards and fridge. Are you going to run out of ketchup in a month or two? Put it on the list. Peanut butter? Put it on the list. Anything with a long shelf life or freeze well \u2013 **put it on the list**. You need to accumulate enough items to make a 200$ purchase at some point (if you have a larger household, this might be easier for you). A lot of the things on your list may be at regular price when you finally have enough, so step 5 is important.\n\n(Sometimes there's a \u201cbuy 150$ for 20 000 points\u201d promotion. This one comes out rarely, I think I've seen it twice a year. Jump on it! If you can make it a 300$ grocery, you\u2019ll accumulate 40 000 points! 40$! I\u2019ve never been able to make that happen but one day perhaps \ud83d\ude09 When the kid turns into ogre teen...)\n\n5- **Cross-check everything if it\u2019s not on sale**. Don\u2019t put it on the list if the regular price is lower at another grocery chain. If the item is only a 10-cent difference, use your own judgement. Do you want to drive or walk for that extra few cents savings? That\u2019s actually one way the rewards program makes a long-term client out of you, like it has with me. \"The customer is willing to buy Heinz with us a 3.79 rather than 3.69 at the other guy \u2013 I\u2019m making the profit on selling the Heinz instead of the other guy\"). I\u2019m fine with that.\n\n**6- check out your PC account \u201coffers\u201d frequently.** The program, getting to \"know\" you better and better, starts sending offers for brand items you already buy (and for a lot of stuff you don\u2019t buy but it hopes you'll buy). I only buy Breyers ice-cream for example. I regularly get a \u201c200 points per 2$ of Breyers\u201d offer. That doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but it adds up, especially if you buy two ice-cream containers (which I do\u2026 when they\u2019re on sale :)). Another offer I get all the time is for a specific brand of bread I buy. 400 points per two loaves. This is where you see how having a freezer is essential to get the program working at the 100$-level. Rather than just the two loaves, I\u2019ll buy 8 (bread keeps well in the freezer and we go through a lot of bread). I\u2019ve just earned an extra 2 400 points! And so on, and so on. The largest amount of points I\u2019ve ever earned in a single purchase, combined with the 200-dollars-offer, is 38 000 points. 38$ of money toward groceries! It\u2019s crazy. So far, I\u2019ve made two 180$ free groceries and have 100 000 points left in the bank!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few other things I do (but I got the frugal gene from my mom and this is borderline OCD so you might not be able or want to get so involved...):\n\n\\- I try to use the 20 000 points offer when the flyer has something at a good discount that I can buy a lot of. I make a ton of tomato sauce. Sometime cans of tomatoes are 1.25$ in the flyer. These things have a year shelf life. I buy 10-15 (they're a drag to carry back to the car though!). Cans of tomatoes are often on my \"I\u2019ll eventually need\" list (point 4). If I don\u2019t have the offer 20K points offer, I\u2019ll still buy the multiple cans though, because I need them and that\u2019s around 10-15$ of savings. Toilet paper goes on sale too, and \"fills in\" the order more quickly. If the sale coincides with the 20K offer, I buy 4-5 packs. Hey, you never stop going through toilet paper.\n\n\\- Next week's flyer usually comes out a day or two before the end of the previous one. Say I'm out of X product and it wasn't on sale this week, I'll check out the new flyer as soon as it's out to see if it's on sale next week. If it is, I'll wait to use the 20K offer if I received one. The offer usually covers the Monday to Sunday period rather than the Thursday to Wednesday flyer period so you can make the comparison. This strategy works best for products that recurrently go on sale and that you always buy: juice, Phily, margarine, toilet paper...etc.\n\n\\- When I have the 20 000 points offer, I do my grocery online and pick it up (small fee). I do it that way because if I'm missing a few dollars to reach 200$, I can do a search by category and filter by price (sometimes there are additional sales I didn't know about). \"Oh, I could buy frozen spinach or jam\", or whatever thing. As long as you\u2019re not buying (in my case) the Breyers at 8$ per container rather than 4$ when it\u2019s on sale, you\u2019re not getting \"had\" by the store. (Also, OMG heaven to not have to walk through the aisles and wait in line.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo accumulate 450$ in 2 years and a half, I figure I used the 20K points offer about 8-9 times combined with the other PC points grabs. It\u2019s a lot of work but it\u2019s a heck of a lot of groceries too. Holy, have prices gone up on everything... That money is really welcome.\n\nBTW my mother also gets these offers and uses a similar strategy in another province (though she can't earn nearly as many points having no kids), so I\u2019m not an outlier. This is just how the system works and how you can make it work for you! (Funny story: one day I excitedly told her about my discovery once I got to the 80 000 points mark and she's like, \"meh, I've accumulated 100 000 points\". She was already \"using\" the program. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThis post was REALLY hard to organize and I hope it was clear enough and not just a huge wall of text...\n\nGood luck saving!","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678380104.0},{"title":"Looking for ideas to help me repurpose this box.","author":"GhoulishSoap","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11n63ac\/looking_for_ideas_to_help_me_repurpose_this_box\/","text":"Picked this up cheap at a thrift store.

My partner works for a company that produces both pet and agricultural products and had thought pellet litter would be a great use of their excess chaff after cleaning seed. However, they quickly found out that that the standards for making pellets for litter are significantly higher in terms of what kinds of products can go into them, and the requirements for toxicity testing. Which is good, it's designed to keep animals from being in contact with pesticides or fungicides that are present in a lot of agricultural waste and which could be harmful to animals (and people for that matter.) \n\nWood pellet composition isn't heavily regulated in the US (Europe has their own standards) and they aren't required to meet the same kinds of health and safety standards as pet products. They're usually made of industrial, construction, and agricultural wastes without as much concern for what treatments may be present because it's not meant to be in contact with humans or pets. \n\nMy suggestion is to read the labels very carefully for any toxicity and health information and ask your supplier about the composition of the pellets, as it varies from region to region. A sick pet is more expensive than any litter and make a judgement call. \n\nI just figured I'd put it out there that there can be differences between the two products in terms of manufacture and what goes into them, not just in price.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678239236.0},{"title":"Best Super Frugal Tips?","author":"22lovebug22","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11lzvfn\/best_super_frugal_tips\/","text":"My family lives a moderately frugal lifestyle.

I was disappointed and frustrated that the quality didn't live up to the price.\n\nBut instead of just accepting it and letting my money go to waste, I decided to return the hoodie. I didn't want to settle for a subpar product, and I wanted the company to know that their product was insufficient. Plus, I didn't want to contribute to waste by keeping a hoodie that I wasn't happy with.\n\nReturning an item that doesn't meet our standards is not only a frugal choice, but it's also a way to hold companies accountable for their products. By returning it, we're sending a signal that we expect better, and that we won't settle for anything less.\n\nOf course, this advice only applies to items that have a good return policy and are within the return period. But many stores do offer generous return policies, and taking advantage of them is a smart move.\n\nSo, next time you're tempted to keep a product that you're not happy with, remember that returning it is a frugal choice. You deserve products that meet your standards, and companies deserve to hear our feedback when they don't deliver.

He's convinced himself that the frugal choices is to buy and install a dozen timers in the house lighting, at something like 20$ each, to save maybe 10c a year in LED bulbs power use.\n\nsometime the immediate frugal choice actually changes the situation such that a future choice that could have had a bigger impact is no longer an option.\n\nand sometimes the frugal choice is to spend the money on the thing: for example a world map shower curtain tore through a couple of the holes and no longer hung right. I was about to spend a half hour trimming a bit of material from an area that it wouldn't be noticed, warm up the household iron get some scrap baking parchment a fuse a reinforcemt strip to the top that also closed the tear outs, and use a hole punch to punch the holes for the curtain rings to hang it up again... until my housemate said, \"You could do all that, or spend a dollar at the dollar store for a replacement.\"\n\nFocus your frugal on the choices that get the biggest benefit. The whole 20 percent of the effort in the right areas gets you 80 percent of the return. After that there are points of diminishing returns. And never forget to include the value of your time and energy, lest you you work for an hour to save a nickle, when you could spend a nickle and use the hour in another area that benefits you more.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677828238.0},{"title":"Trick I use for saving money on coffee","author":"Tyreal676","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11hgloo\/trick_i_use_for_saving_money_on_coffee\/","text":"Hello everyone!

The cartridges I have are both refilled. One I  inherited it alongside the printer, and although it has been refilled  several times (color) it still works and I believe it\u2019s original. The  black cartridge I bought remanufactured and I think it may not be  original. The chip is clearly different from the color cartridge, also  the plastic seems worse.\n\nI refilled both cartridges for the first time and it was working just fine for both black and color.\n\nAfter  a few days, the black had some dirty headers and I was getting lines so  I took it out and cleaned it. Then the ink stopped flowing to the  headers I guess because I sucked up too much while cleaning it. I saw  that it\u2019s an XL cartridge so I poured 2ml more of ink, a total of 4ml at  this point, and also sucked the ink from the headers until it came out  with the stand thing to suck it. Now the ink was flowing again.\n\nAfter  this, I reinstalled the cartridge and then, it wasn\u2019t working anymore.  But not only that, the color cartridge I also refilled and was working  stopped working too as long as the black one is installed.\n\nIf you remove the black cartridge, you can still print color.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been researching online and have tried so many things, including:\n\n\\-Unplug the printer, restart pc, reinstall cartridges, etc.\n\n\\-Restart the printer by pressing X and off button for 20s or more.\n\n\\-Uninstall the printer and drivers, reinstall.\n\n\\-Uninstall HP smart.\n\n\\-Clean the cartridge and chip with alcohol as well as the contact inside the printer.\n\n\\-Cover  the bottom right part of the chip in the cartridge with tape to try and  reset it, no success or any change. Also after removing the tape no  change.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know what to  do. It\u2019s a perfectly fine cartridge. It\u2019s all refilled and it\u2019s very  new, it\u2019s the first time I refilled it. The only problem seems to be the  printer refusing to print with it.\n\nI  think the printer doesn\u2019t recognize it. I am not sure. But it shows  this stop sign icon, same as if you don\u2019t install any cartridge. There\u2019s  a difference tho if you don\u2019t install anything or you do install the  black. Because if you just install the color it\u2019ll print color, but if  you install both it\u2019ll stop printing.\n\nWhen there\u2019s no cartridge inside or you have installed the black cartridge, the low ink light starts flashing.\n\nWhen only the color cartridge is installed, the low ink light is on but static.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/OEHkuLQ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/OEHkuLQ)\n\nThanks for reading and specially if you leave a comment trying to help","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1677813989.0},{"title":"What would work in place of a couch?","author":"OttoVonAuto","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11gmigm\/what_would_work_in_place_of_a_couch\/","text":"We just moved to a new apartment and currently have a tv\/coffee table and a tv stand, but no couch! \n\nWhat would be a comfy yet affordable alternative for a couch for watching movies and chilling in the living room?

I ended the month having spent $444 for the month. I did pretty bad last night and bought a bunch of cookies\/snacks\u2026 but the good news was it was Aldi and they were not name brand snacks. \n\n* GOAL: No impulse buys from Costco. \n    * Almost a success. I caved last week and bought a single bag of Godiva dark chocolate hearts,  marked down after V-Day. I did well otherwise.\n\n* GOAL: Nothing ordered from Amazon, Target, etc. \n    * ALOMST a success. In January I bought curtains for the living room, and upon hanging them, realized I really did need a second set, so I caved and ordered them. (They went on sale days later, so I re-ordered both sets and will be returning the original order to save, I think $24.) \n\n* GOAL: No restaurant\/fast food AT ALL.\n    * FAIL. But we did not spend much as most months. I had to work in office twice this month, and normally I pack a lunch, but I treated myself. I had a BOGO Bowl from Panda Express and ended up paying less than $4 for one meal, then I had a $4 off a plate at Panda Express, so the second meal was about $5. So, $9 on fast food isn\u2019t awful, but it wasn\u2019t my goal. My husband also took our oldest to Chipotle once as a reward for doing better in school. \n\n* GOAL: Try to convince husband to reduce the lunches he buys at work.\n    * SUCCESS! He was NOT happy when I mentioned this idea, but I was very proud of him. He spent $34 vs $69 in Jan, $104 in Dec, $119 in Nov, etc. If he can keep this up, it\u2019ll be great for our finances!\n\nObstacles I anticipated\/results:\n* The furnace: Ended up having to pay $75 for a furnace tune up. I\u2019m thinking we need a new furnace guy, because that seems steep. But what do I know\u2026 \n\n* The Spring Break 2024 Vacation + Replacement Windows & Doors: We went ahead with all of it. We made down payments for our 2024 Spring break vacation (due in full by December) and chose the less expensive option we\u2019d been looking at. OH. There was also a deal with my credit card and I got $35 off when I spent $100 on that CC toward the downpayment. (Total payment $265.) \n* We also made down payments to two companies to replace windows (company 1) and our entry doors (company 2). Combined, that was almost $1,700. We will be paying the windows up front in cash in June from savings, the doors we financed at 0% financing for 18 months, meaning big payments starting in June because doors are friggen\u2019 expensive and we\u2019re replacing 3. But we can make it work. \nOverall (when I deduct the vacation & windows\/doors because we planed to dip into savings for those) we didn\u2019t do awful, ending with a surplus of $957 for the month. \n\nThings I learned: \n* I can keep the grocery budget lower if I try hard enough and don\u2019t shop hungry (yeah, that happened one week too\u2026) Meal planning is of course great, but I\u2019m pretty bad about that and really need to do better. We typically have veggie loaded nachos once a week as well as a pasta dish another night. \n\n* Hubs is capable of spending less on lunches by bringing his own! (Okay, I knew this because he used to do it. But he fell into bad habits\u2026 Hopefully he\u2019s into better habits. I will also go back to NOT buying lunch at work 99% of the time.) \n\n* I don\u2019t need to order everything that pops up on sale from my Amazon wishlists. There\u2019s almost never a reason that I need something that quickly. I shall continue to watch for GOOD sales to pop up on those items I\u2019m watching, and debate at that time how badly I need\/want it. (I\u2019m honestly not awful about this to begin with. I\u2019m already frugal, I just want to be more!)\n\n* Now that I have curtains for my living room I should NOT need to make this purchase again! \ud83d\ude09 And I really should\u2019ve waited for a sale in the first place, Target always has a home sale to take advantage of at some point. I was afraid these curtains would be unavailable though. \n\n* Now that we have to make the payments on the windows\/doors and vacation, we need to continue to keep costs down and probably re-evaluate the extra money we\u2019re currently throwing at the mortgage principle right now. \n\n* Thank goodness we\u2019re actually getting a tax refund this year, so we can throw that at these new payments. :)","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677704885.0},{"title":"I have a budget of $50\/100 for food - any ideas?","author":"Suitable-Mission-740","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11fu0ty\/i_have_a_budget_of_50100_for_food_any_ideas\/","text":"I\u2019m in pickle lol - I don\u2019t have much to spare and very limited in my resources so any recommendations- I\u2019m trying to stay away from fast food.

Like, a lot less. While I earn 2000 dollars US\/monthly divided into biweekly payments - which is enough to pay the rent - I'm concerned that I don't see the numbers go up on my checking account, usually sticking around an \"average\". \n* I really don't like staying in, like, *at all.* My home is a place to eat, sleep, and work and I tend to crave getting out on my feet in the evening and on weekends. A large part of this is because this puts me in a situation where I'm around other people. \n* I use a gym (\\~ 50 US dollars\/monthly membership) for exercise in the Spring and Fall and a public park pool (\\~30 US dollars\/seasonal) in the Summer, which gets me out of the house and keeps me moving around\n* Not liking to stay in carries over to spending a lot of time in cafes\/coffee shops in the daytime on weekends and days off. This obviously means money being spent. However, the main two coffee shops I go to have a strong sense of community attached (e.g. everyone in the neighborhood knows the owner and staff on a first name basis), which is a large part of the reason I go there. \n* One thing I'm aware I can do less frequently is going to bars\/clubs - I've figured out one strategy is to treat these mainly as events spaces for the sporadic events (performances etc.) that I'm interested in, even if I might miss socializing with the other regular customers more often. \n* My main \"free\" events are Open Mic nights, group tabletop gaming, and Sip'N'Paint\/Drink'n'Draw type events. I'm glad these are free of charge but since they are usually hosted at local businesses I sometimes feel compelled to spend money there to support the business with more than just my presence. \n* The public library is always a free option and while I enjoy browsing books, DVDs, etc. I usually go pretty stir-crazy there pretty quickly due to the quiet and lack of socialization. \n\nMy one issue with places like the gym (not free but gives a place to go) and the public library is that they don't really feel like they encompass a scene or a community that I belong to. \n\nWhat do other people here do when they really want to go places and meet people but don't care to spend a bunch of money?

The Nintendo eShop currently has a deal where you pay $100 and get 2 game vouchers that can be used for any game within 12 months, including TOTK. That\u2019s already a great deal in itself, but if you have a Costco membership or know someone with one, then\u20262.)

Recently the bundles have not been as good but you can get 2-3 good games for cheap. If I can play 2 hours of gameplay or more per dollar I consider that a win. There are monthly bundles and random game bundles throughout the month. There are other sites for bundle but they are usually lower quality games and aren't worth it in my opinion.\n\nSecond, I always compare prices on gg.deals, it lists tons of places to buy a game I might be looking at. It has it separated by official and grey market key sites and shows price history as well as lowest recorded prices so you can buy games at the cheapest price possible. Personally I am okay with buying from the grey market sites but you can still find good deals with the official stores listed.\n\nThird, utilize family sharing. You and a friend can go half in on a middle man steam account and just take turns accessing games so you can subsidize the price. Many games like Elden Ring or new releases\/early access games are hard to find on key sites (only use official stores for big games like this) and the only real way to buy them is on steam at full price. Also check on steamdb if the game supports family sharing, Typically games with 3rd party launchers do not support it.\n\nFourth, gamepass. While I prefer to \"own my games\" on steam, gamepass can be a great way to play new releases or many games for cheap. Continue to make new Microsoft accounts or use the same link for the 1$ trials. I was able to use 1$ trials over and over again for almost a year. I used this to play atomic heart, since 60$ is a huge ask for a linear fps campaign.\n\nFifth, steam trading subreddits like indiegameswap. They have many rules but you an buy\/trade games there and I have been able to gets lots of great games for cheap. Just read the rules and always do your due diligence since it is p2p trading\/buying\/selling.\n\nSixth, patience and research. Most games will drop heavily in price if you are patient. Plus, if you research the game you can get an estimate how much entertainment you can get from it as well. Many games will rotate into humble bundle after a year or two, or will start getting heavily discounted on keysites. For example most of the resident evil games can be bought under 10$ each now. I waited over a year for deathloop to appear in humble bundle, and not only has it had many patches since release, I got way better value for my patience. You generally do not need to buy games on day one.\n\nThere are obviously multiple less ethical options but this guide is focused on buying \/ accessing games in a legal way. \ud83d\udc4d","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677613352.0},{"title":"Misleading pricing on Flash food, anyone else notice this in their area?","author":"gling16","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/11emosv","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1677624836.0},{"title":"What companies have the cheapest 4x6 prints?

I am willing to pay for a quality fridge that will last, but most new fridges have a built in ice\/water dispenser and I do not currently have a water line set up to connect these features. I think I would eventually like to set this up, but don\u2019t think it is a priority right now given that I just need a new fridge as mine is broken so replacing the fridge in the very near future is the most important thing. I also purchased a countertop GE opal nugget ice maker (that I LOVE!) last year, so I already have an ice maker that I use regularly at home. This has been great for drinks, though not great for filling coolers etc. The tap water at my house is great so I just drink straight from the faucet. \n\nI am going back and forth about purchasing a fridge that has the ice\/water dispenser given that it would be an extra cost and project to install a water line. My reason for wanting it is that a fridge is an appliance I hope to not need to purchase again any time in the near future and I do not want to regret not having the convenience of these features in the future if I were to want to install the waterline. For example, I am not sure or the life expectancy of my ice maker and if it were to break, would I regret not having the opportunity to just use the ice maker in my fridge? Essentially, it feels like a \u201cnice to have\u201d feature instead of a \u201cneed to have feature\u201d, given that I am generally fine with drinking my water from the tap and using my countertop ice maker. I am aware that I could just purchase a new fridge that have these features and then not use them until I am ready, but am wondering if I am missing anything here with the trade off (for example, the space that these features take away from fridge storage if I am not going to use them or if there is a chance that not using the waterline for some time would affect it\u2019s use in the future)? \n\nIt seems like a small cost to have the opportunity to use these features in the future should I wish, but also feels unnecessary all of the same?","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677509453.0},{"title":"Betty Crocker Storage Containers at Dollar Store","author":"ViejaFodonga","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11dfkla\/betty_crocker_storage_containers_at_dollar_store\/","text":"I went to the dollar store to by food storage containers.

I had a payment arrangement done and I was paying monthly. The site wasn't loading to make a payment and I called BEFORE my due date to make the payment. I made the payment and the agent has told me to have auto pay so that I don't miss a payment. 1 month later 220 dollars became 7 grand since it charge me with auto pay and it was before my due date. I called the company twice and they told me specifically they see that I have an arrangement. They said that they couldn't return the money and I didn't have the funds to cover it. So they returned the \"check\" after not being successful. I made the payment Luke normal and again I also got charged that same 7 grand again. So basically now I \"didn't pay\" and they made my account a cash only account. When they hindered my opportunities to pay. The electric bill being high is something else entirely that my father screwed up on. Now I'm not sure what to do. I have a confirmation  email of my payment being made and they state they cannot help me even though they misinformed me and especially screwed me on me being able to pay.\n\n\nSorry its a little long. I'm pretty pissed at the situation. The grand total is now at 10 grand and I cannot make an arrival until I pay 10% of it on one payment. I'm literally having trouble sleeping and literally shaking that they might disconnect my service.\n\nEdit: So I looked into my billing situation more and someone did request a billing arrangement. We have panels that were incompletely placed and aren't generating anything (thanks dad) due to this we get charged yearly as apposed to being charged monthly. So the person that has made an arrangement from before only made the arrangement for partial of a year instead of the the rest of the year. So we are technically a little over a year and 3 months behind all this time cause of it. Well now more that they screwed up the payment.","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1677316164.0},{"title":"I've found thrifting to get cheap clothes, I've found TooGoodToGo to get cheap takeaway...

I don't smoke. I don't have a pet any more. I have one plant (that requires water only). I cut my own hair, don't own any nail varnish, don't have any beauty treatments. My flat is basically an empty shell, a bit like you took a vacant apartment and put a few things in it. My bathroom has: toothbrush, toothpaste, shower gel, flannel, towel, moisturiser. My clothes I could fit in a suitcase and I have two pairs of trainers. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful to have all of this. But after bills, there is barely enough money left for food. Nothing else. This morning I have just reached my limit.\n\nI have run out of toilet roll after buying a thing from Wilko that I thought would last the entire month. I have little food in. I am just absoluteley sick of it. I reached my limit and posted to two assistance subs which was embarrassing aside from anything else and somehow messed that up probably because I am so stressed and they got deleted for not having the right title or something.\n\nI don't spend money on anything but bills or food, it's like my life has been static for two years now. I had an accident, surgery, I lost a good job, now I live on what I can make, and live in pain. It is SO different from how my life used to be. I'm not saying I was earning tonnes of money but I was a research assistant at a university so it was above minimum wage and I could manage easily on it. Now I am buying yellow sticker food, going to shops at times things are reduced, and it's not that really, I can cope with that, it's how I've had to cut EVERYTHING else to the bone, so cutting my own hair, there is NO budget for leisure, anything for me, anything else at all. I have not been able to go anywhere for those two years, away, on holiday, a day trip, anything. I go and sit in a local park! I contacted citizen's advice about budgeting and they said it is not me, that my budget was unworkable but what do I do? If I claimed benefits I would get \u00a3300 a month to live on which is worse than what I earn. With the recent energy increased and almost all bills going up I'd guess most people's bills are over \u00a3300 a month and that's before food which has gone through the roof. I also owe one friend \u00a3200 and another \u00a3150 which I keep borrowing at the end of the month then paying back every single month and I want to get out of this cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTBH the increase in food prices is what has hit me the hardest. I am trying to gain weight as well, I cannot lose any more weight, I am underweight as it is. I would LOVE to buy Huel or something like that to supplement my food but I can't afford that. Everything has gone up. Baked beans were 33p they are now 55p. Cheese has gone up. Every single item in the supermarket now seems more expensive. I am just really fed up. I literally don't know how to cut corners any more, if anyone has any ideas let me know. I cannot grow my own food as no outdoor space, the allotments have a 3 yr waiting list and I doubt I would be able to manage it realistically because I struggle to walk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, I am just fed up and having to ask for help with a wishlist has just hit some kind of humiliation for me that maybe I am not able to take.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677149991.0},{"title":"I discovered a money-saving freezer organizing life-hack.","author":"MrsBeauregardless","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11ap32c\/i_discovered_a_moneysaving_freezer_organizing\/","text":"I organized and *labeled* my freezer space by categories: meats, broths, fruits and vegetables, pre-prepared, flavorings (ginger, adobo sauce, parsley, etc.), baking (yeast, whole grain flours, nuts, brown sugar), grains, soup bags (skin, bones, vegetable trimmings, etc.), baked goods, and desserts.\n\nWhen I had everything stuffed in all willy nilly\/wherever it could fit, I couldn\u2019t find stuff, so I would buy duplicates.

I currently have been using one air purifier that I take to every room I move to but I'm starting to think I should run them during the day and turn them off in the evenings. I got 2 more on the way to keep all three bedrooms dust free. Running three small purifiers a 8hrs a day shouldn't cost too much right? At the moment I'm spending about a $1 a day and I usually turn on my purifier right when I get home.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1677202957.0},{"title":"Can I use epoxy resin on the top of this end table from IKEA to make it durable from stains\/nicks?","author":"mostlycatsnquilts","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/4vmwp64tx2ka1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677201717.0},{"title":"Backyard Beach Party Ideas","author":"Skairipa_102","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/11ai5t0\/backyard_beach_party_ideas\/","text":"I'm planning on throwing a beach themed party in my backyard, and I'm looking for some affordable suggestions for decorations, games, food and drinks, etc. So please, feel free to comment anything you can think of to help me throw this party!

The seat on her walker flips up to a little storage compartment. Today while visiting her, my kids wanted some of her marshmallows. I didn\u2019t see them in her room. She then flips up her seat to show unveil two huge bags of marshmallows, every butter packet she\u2019s ever seen there, jelly, the free saltine cracker packs, the napkins, everything ever given to her. I just thought it was so sweet how resourceful she is. There\u2019s no shortage of food or supplies there, but you can\u2019t ever take the Great Depression upbringing out of someone, I guess.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677115249.0},{"title":"When do you see Frugal cross the line?","author":"NoellaChel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/119p7xa\/when_do_you_see_frugal_cross_the_line\/","text":"What are some hard No that you see others doing to cut costs that you won\u2019t do\u2026 how far is going to far? \n\nMy own example \nI won\u2019t turn down heat in my own home and freeze to save a few dollars. \nBut I will take some extra Mayo packets home for my sandwiches for work. \nI won\u2019t eat food tossed in trash","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677128993.0},{"title":"What is one thing or more that you are willing to spend more money on?","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Frugal\/comments\/119xcxi\/what_is_one_thing_or_more_that_you_are_willing_to\/","text":"For me it\u2019s shoes.\n\nI live in the Midwest and I blister easily; I also spend 12 hrs on my feet for my job, so having good quality shoes is imperative.\n\nI try and see if I can shop during sales, but if I don\u2019t, then a more expensive but quality pair of shoes is what I \u201csplurge\u201d on.\n\nAlso, annual screenings.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677157899.0}]
