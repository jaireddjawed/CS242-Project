        "text": "A little while ago I get a run up for a normal-ish online order going to some not so great apartments. It was a cash order and the only instructions on the order were, and I quote: \"deaf.\" Okay, this will be interesting, I thought. So I pull up and, sure enough, the signs taped to their door indicated that they were in fact deaf. Cool, I'll knock loud.   \nAn older woman answers the door, visibly frustrated at the sight of me. She starts waving her arms, \"no!\" and explains, in a combination of ASL and her best speech, that she didn't order, and doesn't know how to order. \nI say, okay, I'll give the number a call. I do, and it's an interpreter number, which was not at all evident at first, so I was very confused. After some disjointed communication, I get told basically what she to me at the door, and I left. The manager on shift said he had the same thing happen not too long prior. Weird.  \nFast forward a few weeks, and I see that address pop up again, with instructions saying something along the lines of \"I am deaf knock loud.\" Against my better judgement, I for whatever reason decided not to call and try and deliver it.   \nI pull up, do the same knock, she answers the door, and gets *pissed*. She looks to the side of the door, and a guy pops his head out and screams at me, \"you need to leave!\" The only words I was able to get out were \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\". \nI get back to the store and the phone rings, sure enough, it's them. My manager picks up, and I'm hearing phrases such as \"well that's not acceptable behaviour from my driver.\" Their story involved me screaming and cussing at them, I guess, trying to get me fired. I was flabbergasted, given that I couldn't have done that if I wanted to. Thankfully, nothing came of it.  another order came up a few weeks later, which I flat out canceled immediately.  \nWhoever is making these orders is a real bastard.",

        "text": "This happened the summer of my 18th birthday. I had just gotten a job delivering pizzas in a ski resort town and was working my first shift there. \n\nAround 10pm (closing time) I had my last delivery of the night on a street I had never visited before. As I got there, I realised there was probably a party going on inside as I could hear the music blasting from the driveway and there were cars parked everyone on the street around this house. \n\nAs I walk up the stairs to the door I‚Äôm not really sure what to expect as it‚Äôs my first time delivering pizzas to a party. Of course some silly scenarios go through my mind as I‚Äôm waiting for the customer to open the door but I never could‚Äôve dreamed in my wildest dreams what was about to happen. \n\nFive guys end up answering the door - all in their late 20‚Äôs early 30‚Äôs I‚Äôd say. There‚Äôs obviously a party going on inside and these guys have been drinking. Behind them in the kitchen I see a few women casually talking and drinking at the dinner table. I give the guys their order and they proceed to pay me (they left a decent tip if I remember correctly) and just as I‚Äôm about to thank them and leave one of them asks me if I would like to stay and have a beer with them. Now I wasn‚Äôt expecting this and politely declined their offer but the 4 others seemed to like the idea and quickly started insisting that I come in and join them for just one beer. After declining a few times I hesitantly gave in and accepted their offer. I had not yet taken one step into the house that all five of them grabbed me and dragged me through the front door. Before I could realise what was happening they had taken me through the house to the living room where they quite literally tossed me like a ragdoll through the air and onto the carpet. When I looked up, completely stunned, I realised I was surrounded by about 25 other guys, seemingly all drunk, and 2 women who were barely dressed. After noticing one of the guys wearing a pink dress, I put 2 and 2 together and realised that this was a bachelor party. The two women were effectively giving them a show, one had a strap on on and was riding the other. As all this information started to sink in, one of the guys started chanting ‚ÄúPIZZA BOY! PIZZA BOY! PIZZA BOY!‚Äù and the others all joined in and started cheering. It was hilarious and surreal and after the initial shock passed I was more than happy to sit back and have a beer with my new friends and enjoy the show and so I did for about an hour. The guys at the restaurant couldn‚Äôt believe it when I got back and told them what happened. ",

And that doesn't always happen, but I keep trying anyway :) I have been ordering the same thing, brownie and a water (I need the water to meet the $ minimum) for years. A couple years ago (and maybe sometimes now, if I'm being honest), I used to order every other day. So yeah, the some of the delivery people know me.\n\nI ordered an actual pizza the other night (shocker, lol), and my delivery person commented that she was surprised that it wasn't my usual brownie and water. She said that her manager told her that I've been ordering since before their current location, and that everyone knows me. And apparently I'm super nice. \n\nI'm torn between being super mortified and also pleased that they think I'm nice. I try to tip well and treat everyone nicely. I mean, I think you should be nice to everyone! But also, I've always worried that all the staff make fun of me and my regular order behind my back. Hopefully not! I just wanted to share. Do you guys have any regular customers that everyone knows about (for good reasons)?",

Most of our business comes from people visiting from out of town staying in these places, which entails us visiting then pretty frequently and consequently traveling on many elevators with strangers. \n\nMost nights, I don't mind the occasional round of small talk about weather/food/events in town or whatever else might come up. However, that's not always the case and I have run up many flights of stairs in avoidance of these situations. \n\nI often make an initial judgement of the people it appears I'll be making my ascent with and check how many floors I need to travel. This has led to occasionally running up as many as 8 flights of stairs. I view my preference for silence as having an added bonus of providing occasional workouts, while I'm sure others view it as just silly behavior. \n\nAnyone else run into similar situations or have similar inclinations?",

        "text": "The worst delivery I ever had was an order that the customer thought he placed as a delivery, but somehow got set to carryout. His order was made, and was sat in our store for a while. One of my coworkers called him to let him know his order was ready to be picked up after it had been waiting about 30 minutes. He gets pissed off and said it was supposed to be delivered. They remake it, and it's ready just as I get back from another delivery.\n\nI know right away it's going to be bad because I see it's an old order, about 50 minutes old by the time it gets assigned to me. I take the remake and drive out. His house is about as far away as it can be, about 13-15 minutes of a drive. I ring the doorbell, and a child yells out \"Who is it?\". I say \"(Store Name) here with your pizza!\". The child yells back \"Who?\" Annoyed already, I repeat. The child yells out that it's the pizza guy, and a few moments later, the dad comes to the door (which by the way is still not open at this point) and in a loud, \"thug\" voice yells out \"WHO IS IT?!\" Unfazed, I say \"(Store Name) with your order\". He opens the door, and there are about 3 small children behind him.\n\nHe then spends a few minutes berating me about how the order took so long, how could we let his kids starve, etc. I explain that somewhere along the line there was an error when placing the order (I didn't check to see if it was an order placed over the phone/online). He didn't care and just wanted to act foolish in front of his kids. He even had the audacity to ask if it was an old pizza, and pretty much didn't seem to believe me when I told him it was remade and fresh. And of course, he stiffs me on the tip. Completely ruined my night.\n\nThe best delivery I had was a nice old man, who was drunk when he answered the door. After exchanging money and food, he hands me a $20. I ask if he meant to give me that much, and he just says \"You're worth it, aren't you?\". I told him I appreciate it, and then I leave after saying goodbye.\n\nHonorable mentions to bad deliveries are always those who order late as hell, are at the edge of our radius, and stiff on tips. When I'm delivering that late, it's literally eating into my free time, wasting my gas, and putting my car at risk. Always burns me up.",

For example, morning shift was busy, couldn't finish prep. Dishes were piled up like some 8 foot tall statue to the Greek god of lexans. Morning shift drivers stayed late to get things caught up, but the delicate sensibilities of the closing assistant manager were impinged upon.

He hurried back inside before I counted the money when I realized that he conned me for 13$ which would come out of my tips for the day. I Knocked on the door and his wife came to the door, she asked what the problem was and I told her. She opened the door and yelled at me to get in or the cat would get out. I went inside against my better judgment and immediately felt a sinking feeling in my stomach. It didn't feel right. The wife kept trying to close the door behind me which had quite a few locks. I was pretty scared and have heard of this happening to other drivers in the area, so I kept my foot in the door so she couldn't close it. She told her husband to get more cash, he got it and I left.

        "text": "A little background before I begin: \n\nI work at a local Italian restaurant that does a pretty good delivery business. We have nearly no strict policies in place in regards to deliveries, it's pretty much common sense and whatever seems right at the time. They've expanded their business past what they're capable of managing and rely heavily upon their employees experience and judgement to run efficiently. That's all relevant to what transpired a few months ago:\n\nI arrive at a room within a fairly nice hotel with a pizza and a few sides and a ticket indicating the customers were going to pay me in cash. A father and mother answer the door with their kids eagerly looking behind them. I tell them their total and they immediately ask if there's something they need to sign.....great. Here we go again (this confusion happens constantly at our store). \n\nI explain that I have indicated that they were to pay in cash and they state that they've already given their credit card information to the store. I asked if they called back after initially placing their order, which they confirmed. Not the end of the world, I just need to call the store to confirm that this took place. \n\nI wait for nearly 4 minutes on hold while the weight of their pizza begins to ache my arm. I feel awful about the situation because one way or another, I'd like this family to get their food and I'm standing there holding it hostage. I decide that I've made them wait long enough and I tell them I'll get it resolved back at the store, but I'd take their word for it. I hand them their pizza and I'm on my way. \n\nI get inside and immediately ask if they received payment for that order, and find that I've been deceived. I don't panic though, and decide I'll just give them a call and sort it out now that I know we have no payment information from them. I'll be Me and they'll be LC (lying customers):\n\nMe: Hey, this is the driver from ***** Italian restaurant. I got back to the store and nobody here received a call from you regarding payment for your delivery, so I was hoping to get that information now. \n\nLC: Oh, well honestly the pizza you gave me was cold, the mozzarella sticks were burnt and the salad was disgusting. \n\nMe: I'm so sorry to hear that, the pizza didn't feel cold as I took it out of the bag and handed it to you, but I'd be happy to remake that for you and get a fresh order sent to you as soon as possible. However, that still doesn't resolve the lack of payment. \n\nLC: I don't think we should have to pay for the food. We don't want any replacement but I certainly don't think we should have to pay for what you delivered us. \n\nMe: I see. I'd be willing to give you a 40% discount on your delivery to compensate you for the unsatisfactory food, but you still accepted and received food from us without payment. \n\nLC: No. I'm not going to give you any information and I'm not paying for this. \n\nMe: Ma'am. It seems you intentionally deceived me regarding the payment of this delivery. I want you to have a good delivery experience with us, and I'd like you to give us the opportunity to make it better, but it looks like this was intentional from the beginning. \n\n(I understand that I maybe shouldn't have been so accusatory, but it's pretty apparent at this point what has happened and I'm slowly losing my cool. I begin pondering calling the police for theft, but immediately realize how poorly that would reflect on our business.)\n\nLC: I have nothing else to say to you. Please don't call me again. \n\nMe: (defeated) Alright. Have a good night. \n\nI tell my manager what happened, what I said in attempt to recover at least something for the restaurant and she kind of just shrugged it off. She didn't want to pursue it further for fear of a bad review online (which they take very seriously here) and I close the case. \n\nThe owner's son came in later that night (a 23 year old hot head with no business sense or desire to work at his father's business) and demanded I give him the hotel and room they were staying in so he could go handle it, but I hid the ticket and told him it wasn't worth it at this point. I felt betrayed just like him, but I didn't feel there was any recourse at this point. Some people are just shitty. ",

        "text": "So I've been working for one of the big chains for a few years now. Recently our store got bought by a franchise, and this eventually led to ALL the former management staff quitting due to pay and policy changes they didn't like. This sucked, as I got along great with them and thought they were genuinely great managers. Our store performed well, ran efficiently, and even when things got stressful I could trust everyone to do their best and weather the storm.\n\nEnter the new guys. Where do I even start? In all the time I've worked here, I have **never** seen a manager crew this infuriatingly bad at their jobs. I could seriously type several pages describing my various issues with them, but I'll attempt to keep this brief. Right now, there's three managers. The general manager, an assistant manager, and another assistant who only works weekends (I'll call them the weekend assistant for clarity's sake).\n\n\\- The general manager is lazy and doesn't know how to properly prepare for anything. It's not uncommon for there to be a full screen on makeline, only to find him in the office twiddling on his phone or smoking out back instead. When he DOES do his job, he does it alright enough but he lacks the gumption and organization of previous managers. He doesn't start making huge plan-ahead orders ahead of time, he doesn't try to route drivers in particularly sensible ways, and when something goes wrong like, for example, the late or closing driver calling in sick, he won't try to find someone to cover the shift. His philosophy in that situation seems to be \"Meh, things will sort themselves out.\" And this is assuming he bothered to schedule a late or closing driver to begin with. Yes, seriously.\n\n\\- The assistant manager is...an odd case. Of the three, she's definitely the most effecient and hard-working. But she has  bad habits of micro-managing and over-demanding things (like expecting drivers to stay later to do side-work *they weren't even assigned*; although tbf I think she's realized this). The thing is though, she has no qualms about telling people to do tasks that she KNOWS they shouldn't do. She keeps sticking this one newer kid on cut station that really really really really shouldn't be doing it, as he seriously does not do one single thing right. He forgets basic side-items, constantly mixes up orders, forgets special instructions like square-cutting and, on occasion, even forgets to cut the friggen' pizza. I tried bringing this to her attention recently, and her response was just \"Oh I know; it's because he hasn't been trained.\"  In other words: THESE MANAGERS ARE NOT BOTHERING TO TRAIN NEW EMPLOYEES. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.\n\n\\- The weekend assistant. Oh god, the weekend assistant. There is not one job in the store I trust him to do. Not one. If he's in charge of makeline, we have to deal with an absurd number of remakes as he doesn't even know what goes on certain specialty pizzas. If he's on the phones, there's a strong chance he'll enter the wrong address AND the wrong phone number. If he's on cut-table, well, he might do a *slightly* better job than the kid I was just talking about. Slightly.\n\nSo, other experienced drivers and general employees of Reddit, what are my options? What used to be at least a very tolerable job has turned into something I dread, as I never know what new bullshit I'll have to deal with next. My first instinct is to quit, since it's time for me to start a real proper job hunt anyways. But job hunts can take months, and I don't like the idea of being unemployed for that long. My only other idea is to contact some higher-ups and tell them my grievances (and believe me, I only scratched the surface in this post. I could go on more about the terrible scheduling and general in-effeciency). Who do I contact? What will they do about it? I seriously fucking hate this job now and I don't know what to do about it.",

In store had to remake 2 pizzas and a cinnamon stick. Then an hour or so later I was taking two orders to be delivered and accidentally swapped the receipts in the bags so they were delivered to the wrong houses. So those then had to be remade and redelivered. I felt absolutely horrible so at the end of the night I split the tips I had made (minus the mileage I made) with the other in store worker who was closing who had had to remake all my mistakes. Wasn‚Äôt a crazy amount, just $20, but I felt so bad about causing that much of a mess that she had to deal with and doing that made me feel better about it. \n\nSo, what‚Äôs some of y‚Äôall‚Äôs worst night experiences?",

Only maybe 30 feet or something like that to go before passing the intersection the kid on the left decides its time to try to dart across the road. I slam on my breaks as the kid *stops in the fucking middle of the road like a goddamn deer and just stares at me*. This is no exaggeration, I came within 3 feet of hitting this kid.\n\nBut here is the fucking kicker. The dad? He just casually saunters slowly across the road, barely even looking my direction as he give me a little shrug and mouths \"sooorry\", kind of lightly shoves the kid along, pretty much doesnt even care that I almost ran over his child, meanwhile I am getting over a small heart attack. Like, what the fucking fuck, dude? I literally almost went to prison for vehicular manslaughter of a fucking child, and you are acting like its no big deal. I got back to the shop, and I dont really smoke cigs anymore, but had to bum one off a co-worker because my nerves were shot.\n\nPlus side, my last delivery of the night was $10 tip on a $10 order, so I have that going for me, which is nice.",

        "text": "People always want parmesan cheese and red pepper, so we keep the packets under the front counter for carryouts. The packets are free, along with plates, napkins, and forks. For deliveries, there's about a 5% chance we'll bring you some without you asking, depending on the driver and their mood. I personally never bring it unless you either ask for it or you've asked for it before and I remember you (and you tip good). Here are some stories for you.\n\nThe truck runs once a week to drop off new food, boxes, and other stuff we need. The night before it came, we had completely run out of parmesan cheese. A guy came in to pick up his order, paid for it, and asked for some cheese, and I told him we were out of cheese, but I could give him some red pepper. He flipped out, accusing us of stealing his money while not providing the paid for service. He demanded the manager, so I, fed up with his attitude, went to get her. I have to give her credit, because she stood her ground and told him the cheese was free and he'd gotten everything he'd paid for, so he stormed out with his pizza.  \n\nAnother driver took a delivery to a house on the edge of our radius, a good 10 minute drive with no traffic, and the customer asked for parmesan cheese while the driver was counting the exact change to make sure she wasn't stiffed. She didn't have any, and told the customer that. The customer opened the pizza box, said, \"Too bad, I was really hoping to have [my chain]'s pizza tonight.\" She overturned the box on the step, sending the pizza everywhere (the driver had to dodge really quick to keep it off her shoes), and slammed the door. The driver wasn't happy, but the customer had paid for the pizza, so she could technically do what she wanted to with it. The customer later called the store claiming the driver had dropped her food, but was shut down by the manager who had heard the full story.\n\nJust last week, I took a delivery to an old folk's home. The delivery was on the eighth floor, and there was a line for the elevator. I got there, the customer paid, and she said, \"The parmesan cheese is in the box, right?\" There was no note on the ticket saying she wanted it, and I told her as such. She countered that she had specifically requested it, and informed me she would be calling my manager. She shut the door and I left, and when I got back to the store, the manager was busy dealing with her. Apparently the woman had ordered through the call center, and they never add notes to the tickets, so it wasn't our fault for once. The woman demanded twenty dollars of store credit, which she wasn't given since she'd gotten everything she'd paid for. The manager, fed up with the customer's shouting, said that they'd give her the parmesan cheese if she came by the store, but the little old lady naturally never came. Something tells me she won't be ordering again. ",

We were both working for a local pizza place, in the store that was just blocks from the local university campus. My friend, T, was what you might call a gun nut. He owned several firearms, and never left home without one, particularly when he was delivering. One night, he takes a pie to a private home on the other side of campus, on a street with no street lights. He knocks on the door, and it is flung open by one guy, revealing another guy pointing at T with, I swear to God, a spear gun. The adrenaline kicks in, and before they can demand the pizza and his money, he whips his semi-auto AMT Hardballer out of the holster in the back of his pants and goes into a firing crouch. (Pizza hits the ground, of course.) The 2 would-be robbers go pale, and the guy who opened the door slammed it closed, fast. T heard them run out the back of the house and get into a car, which sped away. He calmly put the gun away, picked up the pizza, and came back to the store to report what happened. We blacklisted that address, then later found out it was vacant, and the guys had broken in to use it for the robbery. The order was called in on a nearby payphone.",

The other employees are all wearing smiles and I begin to inquire as to what happened. \n\nApparently someone had placed an order through our website to be delivered to a house. When the driver got to the door, he knocked and nobody answered. He said the front door was open and the screen door remained closed, so he was able to clearly see inside the house. He knocked again and decided to open the screen door and yell inside for the customer. That's when he saw him. \n\nA man, fully nude, walking around the corner with headphones on and just casually strolling to the door. There were several expletives shared between the two of them and the driver learned that the man had not ordered the food for himself, or so he said. So not only does he not get to successfully complete the delivery and potentially earn a tip, he had the misfortune of seeing a stranger's junk. I'd be upset too. \n\nWe \"blacklist\" the address and eventually just laugh it off. Except we don't run on a computer system and our \"blacklist\" is just a piece of paper. And humans are prone to making mistakes. \n\nTwo or three months pass and I get an order going to the same address. We've all forgotten by now and the person on the phones/who handles online orders lets the order slip through without looking at the list, but I can't really be upset about that. \n\nI arrive and like clockwork, nude guy comes around the corner with his headphones on and it all clicks for me. \"***king hell\" I remark and just go back to my car without saying anything else. They got us. Again. \n\nI get back and yell about how the list exists for a reason and point to the address clearly printed on it, but I know it was equally my fault for forgetting. It never happened again, but the fact that it worked twice on us is pretty sad. \n\nAnyone else have any similar stories happen to them?",

The customer had paid some of his total with a card, with 7 dollars left to pay in cash. I get there and knock, have him sign for it, and ask for the seven dollars. He tells me he had paid for all of it on his card, and I decided not to press the issue. I should mention this guy was a large black guy, taller than me (I'm 6'2\"), covered with tattoos, and only wearing his boxers. I went back to the store to cash in, saw he hadn't paid the seven dollars on his card, and told the manager what had happened. The manager immediately got on the phone and tried to get it straightened out, but the guy wasn't having any of it and cussed the manager out before hanging up. The manager wasn't willing to call the police over seven dollars, so she decided to just eat the loss and move on. \n\nThe very next day the same guy orders again, and it's a different manager working. It's also a way busier night, as it was a Friday, so people were just trying to get orders out of the oven as fast as possible. The customer ordered two pizzas, and I ended up having to take it out to him. He's in his driveway this time, fully clothed, with a bunch of kids. He pays for his food in full, and I leave, glad it went smoothly this time. But I tempted fate, because it did NOT go smoothly. I got back to the store and saw that, yet again, the guy stiffed me seven dollars. The total on the computer screen didn't match the total on the receipt. Do you know why? The guy called the store after I'd left and had another pizza added to his order, cussing out the manager when she refused to change his order since it was already on its way until she gave in and did it. So I couldn't cash in or take any more orders until this guy's other pizza was done and I could take it out to him. I feared for my safety after what happened last time we'd asked him for more money, so I asked another driver to come with me, a driver who has pro-gun bumper stickers on his car, so I knew he could take care of himself. We get to the guy's place, and as soon as we approach him, he shooed us off, outright DENIED he'd ordered a third pizza, and started cussing us out. So we hotfooted it out of there and had the manager take the third pizza off his order so I could cash in. But she messed up which pizza he'd refused, and she took a more expensive one off by mistake, so I got an extra dollar in change, making it 1.09, which I split as best I could with the other driver. \n\nAs a chain, we're not allowed to blacklist customers (if we want to blacklist someone, we have to run it by corporate, and it's ultimately their call; we've only successfully gotten one address blacklisted), but fortunately that guy hasn't ordered again. And it should go without saying the guy never tipped and he got mad both times because I didn't bring parmesan cheese, which he never asked for.",

And because the owner can never pay us on time, he moved the Pay dates back a day to compensate a few months back &amp; still fails to pay on time.\n\nSo today was payday &amp; I opened with our GM who has been running the place since just after Christmas who's turned our store around after the horrible GM we had prior. So about a half-hour after we open, the GM gets a message from the DM that paychecks would be arriving tomorrow at 5 PM. After this, the GM called the owner about our paychecks because people have bills to pay &amp; need the money they earned. The two of them get into an argument &amp; the GM starts throwing other things that our owner has cheated us staff out of such as offering raises &amp; never following through, Holiday pay that was first gonna be on our checks then as separate checks that we never got, Never letting us put in Coke orders so we go months at a time without soda, and the Personal checks for pay. This pisses the owner off to where he starts swearing and the whole conversation ends with the GM being fired &amp; quitting at the same time. Owner tells the GM that the DM is coming in to cover him etc. So the GM not wanting to screw me out of any runs that come in, agreed to stay till the DM came in from the city. as all this is happening, the GM fills in our staff through our Discord chat &amp; here's where the revolt begins.\n\nOur only Insider: quits\n\n5:15 Driver: Strikes &amp; says he isn't coming in.\n\n3:00 Driver: Doesn't show after reading the chat.\n\n6:00 Driver: Asks if we're still open, ends up not showing.\n\n * note that when you include me, that's all drivers*\n\nAssistant Manager: Without my check, my phone's shut off &amp; I have no way of getting a ride for tomorrow.\n\nTakes till an hour later for my first run to come in &amp; it stays slow afterwards. GM says that if someone doesn't show by 3, he shutting the store down. The time comes &amp; we decide to shut down after I finish the 2 runs behind us. I leave with them at quarter after 3 &amp; as I walk out of the store the DM shows up, &amp; the GM leaves. I get back and tell him Insider quit, &amp; the Drivers aren't gonna show. he asked for the numbers that he doesn't have &amp; the owner called the Insider. Insider doesn't put up with the owners BS and it ends with the Insider being told to not enter the store again. Closing Manager comes in 15 minutes late due to his ride &amp; never looked at the chat, so he has no idea what happened. I fill him in &amp; he flips his shit &amp; nearly walks out. About a half-hour after the CM gets there, the DM vanishes. CM is sick of all the BS &amp; decides to shut the store down but doesn't get the chance as now we are in the middle of the dinner rush &amp; he can't.\n\nCM finally gets the chance to do so around 6/ 6:30, but then the DM shows back up to drive as I was only scheduled till 8.  DM offers a bonus to stay the extra 4 hours to close, because He didn't give an amount &amp; I just didn't want to, I tell him I had plans for 9 but ask what he was offering. he said never mind and I get back from my last run at 10 after 8, help with what was coming out of the oven. DM comes back from his run &amp; I tell him I got to go. He then says to the CM, \"Don't take anymore orders, closing the store when I get back.\" He leaves &amp; the CM clocks me out so I can go &amp; I leave. Assumably the store was shut down shortly after. \nIn the time where the DM vanished, the Insider showed up to get the bag of energy drinks he left in the cooler &amp; came with a coffee for the CM who was outside smoking. tells me that he managed to already get hired as a Assist. Manager at the franchise store to the South-East of us. The rest of us are considering jumping to the store to the North-West of us that used to be owned by our owner but was sold a few months back if they have enough openings.\n\nApologies if not formatted correctly, not the greatest writer, &amp; am not use to posting on Reddit.\n",

        "text": "So around the time summer began we started getting deliveries from kids/teens. A lot of crumbled up bills and confused youths not understanding credit card receipts, it‚Äôs fine, that happens with adults too. What isn‚Äôt fine is being a chronic non-tipper or messing with the drivers.\n\nTo put the chronic non-tipping in perspective: there was some teenager who would order a single pizza and not tip. No big deal, except that he was ordering almost every day and lived pretty far out on our delivery area. After each driver confirmed that they had all taken a delivery to this guy in the same week and he hadn‚Äôt tipped anyone, that was it, black listed. That address can only get carry out now.\n\nMessing with drivers: don‚Äôt throw a drink on a driver. Or on anyone, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm having to type this. A kid thought it‚Äôd be hilarious to pour water on a driver from the 2nd story window. And a week later when the parent tries to make a delivery she yelled at *us* for black listing her, saying that it was our job? It‚Äôs not our job to get abused by your kid. \n\nLast note that doesn‚Äôt fall into those two categories: if your kid/teen is going to order food once a week or more, teach them how to listen for the total and to get the money ready before we get there. My manager is really close to blocking a particular address because we always end up standing at the door for 5-15 minutes waiting on a teenager to run around the house counting up $20 in ones. ",

        "text": "I'm not a pizza delivery driver, but I do deliver for Panera Bread. Here's a little backstory with that before I start. Panera Bread just recently started delivering around the time I started there last September. Their deliveries are strictly pre-paid on the app or the website by credit card or gift card so us drivers don't have to worry about counting out change and wasting more time. It does make things easier, but I'm telling you what...until you've worked for Panera Bread, you've probably never seen so many people with 1st world problems...Middle class and rich assholes that literally think they're better than everyone else and can NEVER be pleased.\n\nAnyway, one day I get a delivery order from a customer I had delivered to before fairly regularly. I've only dealt with minor problems with her such as maybe forgetting a fruit cup or yogurt once every 5 times I delivered to her. She ordered very often and usually tipped pretty well. While the line people were putting the delivery bag together for the sandwich and soup, I was asked to call the costumer to inform her we didn't have any more coconut macaroons. Our policy is to let the customer choose another pastry of any kind regardless of price if we don't have any available that they want. I called her 3 times and texted her twice with no answer. My GM told me to just give her a Chocolate Chip Cookie since we got no answer from her, a Free You Pick Two coupon ($10 on average value), and a Free Pastry coupon. Basically $13 in coupons all because we didn't have her coconut macaroon.\n\nFast forward to me arriving. At the time, she worked at this Lutheran Church organization/partnership. I'm not sure exactly what they did but my best guess is they helped raise funds for the church and organized volunteer work. I walked in, asked for the customer. She had already kept me waiting for about 5 minutes or so, but hey, I didn't care too much. It kept me out of the cafe for a little longer. One of the workers there told her that I had been there for a while now, and she screamed out from her office \"Well it's gonna have to wait a little longer! I'm busy!\" I told the other worker I can just drop it off because it's paid for already. At that time, the customer finally comes out, takes the bag into her office, and starts to look at the slip she has to sign.\n\nI politely said to her \"Ma'am, I was told to inform you that we ran out of coconut macaroons. My GM gave you a Chocolate Chip Cookie instead and coupons for a free pastry and You Pick Two for the inconvenience.\" Right then she got this psychotic look in her eye, she ran back to her office, brought the cookie back out, and crumbled it up all over the carpet and screamed her head off \"I DON'T WANT THIS DUMBASS COOKIE!!! I WANT A COCONUT MACAROON THAT I PAID FOR!!! LOOK AT THIS THING CRUMBLE!!! IT'S LIKE A DAMN ROCK!!! IT'S BURNT TO A CRISP IS WHY I DON'T ORDER YOUR COOKIES ANYMORE!!!\"\n\nI told her \"I really don't care, I'm just the driver. If you don't want the thing, take it up with my GM.\" I gave her the number to the cafe, and she went full PSYCHO on my GM. The bits I remember from the grown 30-something woman's toddler tantrum were:\n\n\"Good morning Jessica. My name is Jessica as well and IIIIIIIII AM PISSED!\"....\n\n\"I order from you guys 950 million times every week, blah blah blah\"....\n\n\"I've loved Panera since they opened here over 10 years ago until now...blah blah blah\"....\n\n\"...I mean what kind of business are you running there!!! It's 11:30 AM and you're OUT of coconut macaroons!!!!! What kind of bakery ARE YOU!!!!\"\n\n\"I've had (this obvious made up problem at this time) and (that obvious made up problem at that time) and blah blah blah\"...\n\n\"I've had problems with your male GM, the female District Manager, and the male District Manager blah blah blah\"...This one was hilarious because we only have one GM, a female, and only one District Manager, also a female.\n\n\"I want a full refund and you're gonna give it to me!!!!\"\n\n\"I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM YOU GUYS AGAIN!!!!!\"\n\nOf course, we had to give her a full refund, even though she ended up eating the soup and sandwich and everything else was correct besides the stupid coconut macaroon...oh that fucking macaroon....all this bitching, which happened for 17 minutes by the way...17 MINUTES! All over a $1 coconut macaroon. I don't get what's so great about them. You can buy an entire case of them at any grocery store bakery for $1.\n\nShe finally gets off the phone, I tell her I still need her to sign the slip. She refused and bitched some more. So I wrote a note in front of her saying she refused to sign the slip and demanded a full refund. I got no tip at all and drove back to the cafe. My GM laughed and told me what she was saying on the phone. I told her \"I know...I was there the whole time...\" My GM had the biggest jaw drop. All the managers that were there at the time were laughing and told me my GM kept putting the phone up to their ears the whole time every few minutes during the whole bitching-and-crying-like-a-mental-patient-fest. We still joke about that to this day.\n\nThat's not even the end of the story....Even after she said she'd never order from us again, she ordered from us a few days later to her home address. Another driver took that order. We definitely didn't forget her macaroon this time....buuuuuut of course...she calls in bitching AGAIN...\n\nThe new problem? The driver arrived 5 minutes early.......\n\nFuck you, cunt. Go to Hell you worthless sack of flesh. At this point everyone there has just had it with the dumb bimbo.\n\nThe driver arriving 5 minutes early IS SOMETHING PEOPLE FUCKING STRIVE FOR!!! YOU'RE GETTING YOUR DELIVERY SOONER THAN EXPECTED....You just can't please some people...",

        "text": "About one year ago I took a delivery that I will never forget. It was around 9 pm on a Saturday and I had to take two extra large pizzas to an address that was outside of town in the country. I pulled down a very long gravel driveway up to a run down farm house with one porch light acting as a beacon. As I walked up to the house I noticed Halloween decorations still up on the porch (it was the middle of June) one of which was a grim reaper sitting in a rocking chair. There was no door bell so I knocked on the door, no answer. Knocked again, no answer. Right as I was about to knock for a third time the door slowly creacked open. A decrepit male voice spoke \"hold on a sec\" a light came on  revealing an old man in his underwear. The guy must have been in his 70s or older . He had a terrible hunch and stood no taller than 4'11to 5ft. He was grinning revealing yellowish black teeth. I told him the total was $17.xx. He asked if I could carry the pizzas inside to the kitchen (normally I would say no, but I didn't want this oldtimer to hurt himself). The house was immaculate from what I could see. The old man asked me to wait in the hallway so he could light a candle since the kitchen lights were out (I know weird right?). As he lit the candle I could see five pickle jars sitting on the counter in front of me. The old man asked me to put the pizzas on the floor next to the counter. So I bent over and placed them on the floor. As I was getting up I heard an exhale and the candle went out. I asked the old man to light it again so I could see to no response. I heard the sound of a jar opening followed by the clicking of a lighter. The candle was lit again revealing the old man holding a pickle. He said that \"this is Margery, she isn't supposed to be awake right now but since we have a guest who brought food ,it is ok\". At that moment I wanted to get TF out of there but couldn't for some reason. He walked over to me and handed me the pickle and told me to \"put her next to the pizza box\". I did, and I fucking hate pickles. He then paid me and a booked it out of there.\n\nEdit:- He did tip me though",

I finish all of my tasks and glance at the clock: 11:58pm. Not a second later an online order comes in. My manager and I look at each other and roll our eyes. I'm thinking to myself, oh well, maybe it will be worth it tipwise. I look at the address and it's a known stiffer. Fuck! It's a big order, so my manager's pissed that he has to make all of these pizzas. Three taco pizzas, two mediums and a large. One of the mediums half without onions. He accidentally puts onions on the whole thing, but realized it and has to pick half of them off. Guy also orders a smores cookie, extra ranch, root beer, orange soda, and two waters. We stand around shooting the shit while the pizzas bake cause there's not much else to do. When the pizzas come out, he puts the lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and chips on them and bags them up. I leave the store and head over to this guy's apartment. $55 worth of food, so I figure this guys having a party and maybe I'll get a tip anyway. I get there and call him from my car to tell him I'm outside. He sounds super stoned and asked me to \"review\" his order. I read everything back to him from the receipt, and he's like \"I only ordered the large taco and the smores cookie\". WTF!?!? I tell him I have to call the store and I'll call him back. I talk to my manager and explain what's going on, and of course he's pissed too. He gives me the new total and I call the dude back to tell him to come down and get his food. New total is $25.95. Guy gives me five fives and a one and says \"thanks\" and heads back up to his apartment. I got a nickel tip and a free taco pizza out of it, manager took the other one. SMH at some people. ",

        "text": "About 20 years ago I was in college and got a job at pj‚Äôs working pretty much every Friday Saturday and Sunday night as a closing driver. Really sucked always missing out on shit but the people I worked with were pretty cool and I made enough working those three nights to be able to live. Store I worked at was in a smaller college town 23k + 5k students and many of the deliveries were to the college or close to it. One Saturday night it‚Äôs nearly closing and just me and the manager left. I had been out almost straight and not had a chance to take care of any of my closing shit (dishes mop etc). I get back to the store with like 10 minutes to go and there is one last delivery left. A single small pie for about $6.30. Boss sees the look on my face and says it‚Äôs the last one. \nI get to the address - shitty 3 story apartment house, climb the stairs to the third and knock. No answer but I can hear people so I knock a lot louder. Guy comes to the door and then just yells out ‚Äòpizzas here‚Äô. So I‚Äôm standing there thinking about all the shit I have to do still when I get back and this guy finally shows at the door. I step inside while he writes me a check for exact change and hands it to me. Then he says ‚Äòif you want a tip you have to come have a beer with us‚Äô  I‚Äôm like - I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm working, I drive for a living and I need my job.  So he just repeats himself. I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äòasshole‚Äô but say ‚Äòfine‚Äô and follow him through the apartment and into what looks like a closet but is actually a stairwell to the attic. \nI get up into the attic and realize they had a keg and there was like 50 college kids there. So my customer pours a beer into a cup, hands it to me, and starts pouring one for himself.  Now I am not a world class beer pounder but I can hold my own and I wanted out of there so I tipped it back and sucked the beer out of the cup finishing it before he was done pouring his own beer. I immediately present the cup and demand my tip. Guy was wasted or something because he totally loses it saying how it was the fastest he has ever seen anyone drink a beer and causes a huge scene. I get my tip $3 and get out of there. \nWhen I get back to the store I find that my boss has taken care of most of my shit for me so I finish up and cash out thinking it didn‚Äôt turn out so bad after all.  \nThe next Friday I am on the clock again and take out a triple, 2 at the college and one close by at an apartment building. Drop the first one at the freshman dorm and move to the next - a motel 66 style dorm for on campus non freshman. Small party going on inside and while the customer is paying me for the order someone in the room shouts ‚Äú hey your that driver that can pound beers wicked fast!‚Äù  caught me off guard but I recovered with a quick I hold my own and a speedy exit. I get to my last and this time it‚Äôs the girl at the door. ‚Äú aren‚Äôt you that driver that drank that beer really fast at that party last weekend‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to react - she was kinda hot and I liked being recognized but was also a bit nervous.  \nTurns out I was right to be nervous - this was before you tube but somehow it went viral. For months every weekend i was met with ‚Äúhey - you‚Äôre that driver that can drink beer really fast‚Äù usually followed by ‚Äúyou gotta come pound a beer with us‚Äù. At first I really struggled with it and my tips suffered until I learned to say - I can‚Äôt man, on the clock driving, but I will take one for later!   For the rest of the school year I had free beer every weekend cause no one ever said no to me taking one for later and for some reason giving me a beer was pleasant for them cause my tips bounced back too.   \nMy boss did eventually find out - and I wasn‚Äôt fired but he did say if he ever caught me drinking on the clock I was done. \n\nSometimes I really miss those days....

He got on my left hand side,  and without warning turned RIGHT across the front of my car from the left lane!  \n\nI had to slam on my brakes to avoid t-boning this guy and he spiked his brakes, skidding into the far curb of the side street he cut me off to turn down.  He then proceeded to burn out down that road,  complete with some and squealing tires. \n\nSince he had a topper on his car,  I knew where he worked and called the location as soon as I got home.  With it being nice out,  and the fact that kids like to bike/ people like to walk their dogs on this street and accompanying side streets,  I felt that this guy's manager should be made aware and he should be reprimanded. \n\nI explained what happened (coincidentally the locations district manager was at the store when I called)  and she agreed with me that this was unsafe and unacceptable.  She told me that it's not the first time it has been reported regarding this employee and that drastic measures will be taken.  I said,  \"I'm  not trying to get anyone fired,  just wanted him made aware that he has to be careful. \" to which she responded, \"he got himself fired,  don't feel bad. \"\n\nWas I wrong?  I mean,  this dude could've caused a serious accident on a busy road.  But we're not in the most high income area,  and I'd hate to take food off of someone's plate. \n\nTl; Dr: Driver almost caused a serious accident,  so I called his boss and was told he would be fired.  I'm now feeling guilty. ",

        "text": "Haven't delivered for about 8+ years, but still have fond memories of my times driving around trading people hot food for cash. Wanted to share a story I remembered recently about getting pulled over.\n\nFor the longest time, I was convinced that the car topper was basically a \"police please leave me alone sign.\" I was about 20 years old, and drove like a 20 year old idiot. Drove a bit too fast, sped through yellow lights, and would pull the occasional illegal u-turn to get to my deliveries faster. Never seemed to have any problems with the local police, and so my dumb ass figured they just respected a working man doing what he needed to do. One day, I'm heading to a delivery about 15 minutes away and hit the gas on a long straight road (probably going about 65 in a 40mph zone). Cue flashing lights in the rearview, and I'm blown thinking I'm going to basically be dumping tonights tips into a speeding ticket. The cop comes up to the window and immediately starts in with \"do you know how fast you were going?\" \"No sir, but probably a bit too fast.\" He agrees, grabs my license and registration and heads back to his car.  But, as he's walking back to his car, I hear his radio crackle loudly and suddenly a beat up old sedan comes whizzing by us with two police cars in close pursuit. He runs back up to my window, tosses my license and registration into my lap and shouts \"tonight's your lucky night kid!\" as he runs back to his car to join the pursuit. I learned later that some guy got pulled over for a DUI and decided to do a runner.\n\nWas certainly my lucky night, and you better betD I drove much more carefully after that!!",

We have this online system where you can gift cookies to anyone in our range and leave a note for the recipient.\n\nI deliver a box of chocolate chip cookies to this older couple who look in their late 50s or 60s. I could see in the recipient notes the names of who it was from.\n\nUpon this nice woman answering her door, I say \"Hey I have a cookie delivery for you guys!\"  (Their names inserted)\n\nWith a smile and a look of surprise she says, \"Oh, are these from Mr. Massey?\"\n\nI pause for a moment then say \"Who?\"\n\n\"Mr. Massey?\"\n\n\"Oh, uh, I don't know, but I have a note here that says 'Happy Father's Day! Love, McKay and Tessa!'\"\n\nShe looks slightly confused, like I was joking, or more like she didn't believe me or something.\n\n\"You sure?\" she says smiling.\n\n\"Uh, yeah, that's what it says here at least, haha.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" she says still smiling.\n\nI am so confused. I think maybe I went to the wrong address or something. But I proceed to give my name and the cookie place I work at, which is like 2 small towns above this particular delivery.\n\n\"Oh.\" I think it finally clicks with her. \"You look just like my grandson.\" Her husband then comes in at that time. \"Look, doesn't he look just like Nathan?\" The man lets out some noise somewhat of agreement.\n\nI am awkwardly standing there smiling stupidly. \"Ohh, hahaha... That's interesting!\" I don't know what else to say, because I could see how dumbfounded she was.\n\nI wish them a good night and to enjoy their cookies but I get stopped *multiple times*...\n\n\"So where are you from?\"\n\n\"Uh, same town as the cookie place\" (I said the real name obviously)\n\nI think her grandmother instincts were still circulating since she first saw me at the door because as I'm about to leave she says \"You be careful driving out there, it's dark!\"\n\n\"Thanks I will, haha.\"\n\nI start walking down the steps.\n\n\"OH watch your step! Don't fall!\"\n\n\"Yep, thank you.\"\n\nI left in a such a confused state. Apparently, I am a striking image of this woman's grandson and she totally thought I was. I almost think she still didn't believe me because of the way she acted. It sunk in, then I laughed my way back to the store.\n\nTL;DR: Customer thought I was her grandson, and took a while to grasp the fact that I actually was not and had never seen her before.",

        "text": "So this happened years ago before mobile phones were commonplace.  I was delivering pizzas as a summer job in my hometown - a resort town on Lake Michigan with a sizable population of second-home owners. I was 21 and absolutely loved the job because it was pretty carefree, I got to drive around \ninstead of being cooped up in a building, meet interesting people, and make pretty good money for that point in my life.\n\nIt was a typically slow day, Monday I think, and the manager only scheduled one inside worker, who was also the assistant manager, and two drivers. The second driver no-showed/no-called, leaving me as the only delivery guy. We decided to go ahead with business as usual since it was normally a quiet day, and I certainly wasn't going to complain about the potential for extra tips.\n\nThings started off fairly well and we burned through a few hours before things went straight to hell. We started getting the usual dinner rush, except for some reason our volume was MUCH higher than normal for that day of the week. It didn't take long for orders to pile up, with several hitting the 30+ min mark before they even got out the door. Eventually, I'm taking 3-4 orders at a time, trying to pair runs geographically while still addressing the oldest orders first.  Every time I came back to the store it seemed like there were a half dozen new orders.  I grabbed three orders and their order tags for the western edge of our delivery zone, including one in a fancy new housing development known for high-dollar homes and wealthy summer residents, which was my first stop.\n\nWhen I arrived at the house three kids, the oldest no more than 6 or 7, perched like sentinels in an enormous bay window erupted in joy at the sight of the pizza guy. I grinned a little and reached over to get their pizzas from the hot bag and discovered to my horror that I did not have their pizzas.\n\nMaking matters worse, the kids had clearly seen me and their exuberance surely alerted their father, who'd just opened the door to greet me.  I sheepishly exited my vehicle and approached the door.\n\n\"Sir...I'm really sorry...I think I forgot your pizzas.  I just realized it when I pulled in,\" I said.\n\n\"Huh?\" replied the customer.  In the background I could hear his wife trying to wrangle the kids and get them situated for dinner. Two of them were yelling \"Pizza! Pizza!\"\n\n\"I don't have your pizza - I think I left it at the store...we're busy tonight and I'm the only driver on and I just forgot it while trying to get the rest of my orders together.  I'll go straight back and get it, I'm really sorry.\"\n\n\"Well....how long is it going to take you?\" he replied, clearly annoyed.  \n\n\"Probably a half hour - I'll throw in a bottle of soda and some vouchers, I'm really sorry\" I said, wishing I could suddenly uncover the secrets to teleportation.\n\n\"Uh....well alright. Hurry up please\" he replied.\n\nI zoomed back to the store, cursing myself the entire way. Meanwhile I had two other orders that I couldn't reasonably deliver without breaking the 30 minute promise I'd made to the guy, who was undoubtedly engaged in the unpleasant task of explaining to his children why there was no pizza when they'd CLEARLY seen the pizza man arrive.\n\nI burst back into the store and commented to my co-worker that I'd forgotten a customers' order.  He laughed and pointed out that the orders hadn't slowed down and there were several more in the queue.  He said he was telling people that delivery would take an hour or more due to short staffing but people still wanted delivery.  Bear in mind this town is not particularly large - the furthest reaches of our delivery area was 5 or 6 miles from the store and topped out at about a 15 minutes drive. Nonetheless, people preferred to wait up to an hour rather than drive their lazy asses to the pizza store and pick up the pizza.  \n\nI threw up my hands in frustration and threw the order I'd forgotten in a hot bag, setting it to the side while I scanned the monitor for any other orders I could take with me.  I grabbed two more orders and sped off to the customers' house.\n\nI triumphanty arrived 23 minutes after I'd last left his house. This time, he was waiting by the window.  As before, I reached over to grab his order and discovered to my sheer horror that I'd forgotten it again.   \n\n\"No fucking way!\" I shouted to myself as I furiously looked through all the other orders. Nope - definitely forgot it again.\n\nI looked up to see the guy waiting at his open door. Since I'd yet to discover the mysteries of teleportation I began wishing for the ability to time travel, become invisible, or ultimately make pizza appear from thin air.  Failing at all endeavors, I exited my car and in the most deferential and groveling manner approached him to explain that I, again, did not have his pizzas.\n\n\"WHAT?  HOW!?\" he shouted while turning an impolite shade of red. \n\n\"I don't know.  We don't have enough staff tonight, I'm trying to keep up but in my rush I left your order again\" I said in the meekest and most forlorn voice I could muster.\n\n\"I'll go straight back again, if you still want the pizzas.\" I said.  In the background, I could hear hungry children crying as their dreams of pizza were snatched cruelly from their young hearts for the second time in less than an hour.\n\n\"Do what you gotta do\" the customer replied, with obvious contempt. He gazed into the distance from his expensive doorstep, probably wondering why his life with plagued with such riff-raff as this pathetic pizza boy. \"This is the story I'll tell my children when they don't do well in school,\" he probably thought, \"The parable of the idiot who couldn't even deliver pizzas right\"\n\nI didn't wait around for him to verbalize his disdain any further and once again sped back to the shop. The assistant manager greeted me with the customer's pizza and said \"I realized right after you left that you'd forgotten it again.\"  \n\n\"Yeah, I can't believe I did that, this night is nuts.\" I said\n\n\"Yeah I told customers we're suspending delivery tonight because we're short-staffed.  Just finish out the existing ones and we'll do takeout only until close.  By the way, how was that guy when he realized you forgot it twice?\"\n\n\"Eh, I mean he was really pissed.   That was obvious.  I feel so bad - he's got a bunch of little kids who clearly want pizza more than basically anything else right now\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" my co-worker replied, \"he called after you left and was really, really angry. I told him that it's only two of us and we had one guy no-show. He said he just didn't understand how this could happen, how it was so appalling and one of the worst things he's ever experienced.  He went off...  Anyway, his pizza is free and I have him like $50 in free pizza vouchers.\"\n\nOn my third trip the house there was nobody waiting in the window.  The customer greeted me calmly and took his pizzas without a word.  The house was eerily quiet - no trace of the rambunctious kids from before. I'd hoped his free pizzas, my contriteness, and my co-workers' explanation of why things had gone so awry would maybe lead him to toss a few bucks my way as a gesture of sympathy but, unsurprisingly and quite deservedly, I received $0 as a tip. The customer gave me one last look of disgust as he shut the door and retreated to the comforts of his million dollar house.  I trudged back to my ten-year-old Chevrolet Lumina, angry with myself and the driver who no-showed.  Eventually, the story became one we all laughed about and remains one of my funniest/worst days at a job that I enjoyed a lot more than I probably should have.\n\n*grammar edits\n\n",
