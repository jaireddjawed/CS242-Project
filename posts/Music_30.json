        "text": "Hey, guys\n\nThis request is probably weird but oh well lol \n\nI basically want to get into music more\n\nI'm 18 and I've listened to my fair share of music but until 16 it was all mostly songs I'd *simply come across*\n\nWhether it's from a movie, YouTube, real life, whatever\n\nEvery possible way for you to find a song\n\nAPART FROM actually digging yourself\n\nSo you know I had a couple of hundreds of songs but that's it\n\nBut then I got into rap and I loved it and listened to a lot of it\n\nAnd listened to whole albums by myself and looked for more and more and stuff\n\nAnd I want to gradually do that with other genres too \n\nThe thing is that I'm a weird \"completionist\" so I don't know which way to start this...thing apart from finding some artists and sticking a bit with them \n\nSo I'm actually willing to listen to EVERYTHING someone made if I like them enough \n\nSo the title is basically because of my completionist OCD thing \n\nI said \"famous\" cause I don't want to start with some people with 10k views no offense lol \n\nCould be from any decade btw, I really don't care \n\nI don't need a genre either but if I had to pick one I'd pick Rock (but anything else from pop etc etc to country is all fine)\n\n(My music experience being so chaotic doesn't include a lot of reoccurring artists but some that I've liked more than a couple of songs of are Linkin Park, Oasis, The Beatles, Green Day, etc.)\n\nSo basically if there's a pretty good artist you'd suggest who has a digestible discography then I'd love to know\n\nOtherwise, other advice on how to start this thing with listening to more genres, is good too\n\nThanks in advance",

The music video was filmed almost like an artsy 70s film with no budget would be. It had tasteful nudity. I want to say the artist is Brazilian, he is male. The video starts out with him mentioning something about the universe and planets and trying to be philosophical before the music starts. I think the video is around 4 and a half minutes. It is an Indie song I would say. \n\nHopefully somebody can help me out, we forget so many songs we enjoy then something triggers the memory and we cant quite remember the song name. You guys are my best home!",

        "text": "I was having a pretty interesting conversation with my dad regarding the change in music over the decades and I wanted to bring it to you all to get your perspective and ideas.\n\nMy dad posed the question: why is it that back in the 60s and 70s you had a plethora of rock n roll bands that were considered very talented and had a huge following: most of the bands included British rock bands from that time period I.e Led Zeppelin, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Pink Floyd, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Cream, whatever iteration of Eric Clapton etc. but today, you don‚Äôt have largely popular rock &amp; roll bands with huge followings.\n\nMy first response to his question, was that those rock &amp; roll bands are out there, we just might not know of them. \n\nBut I thought on it some more,  and started to think of it like this: if you take any genre from any time period  - you are not going to find a lot of those artists today. You‚Äôll find a lot of musicians highly influenced by those different genres and time periods. But you are not going to have a lot of 70s Prog bands, or and 80s Pop bands, or a 90s Grunge bands in the year 2023.\n\nBut this thought process lead to think about the current state of music today. And started to think that there has been a huge shift from popular ‚ÄúBands‚Äù to popular ‚ÄúArtists‚Äù. It seems like it is hard pressed to find largely popular and highly sought after bands but rather  only individual artists, who have nameless bands behind them, is where all the money and focus is.\n\nI‚Äôm curious what your thoughts are on the matter.",
