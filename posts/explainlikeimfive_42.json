In my case, I ran into a situation where first shift just ignored notifications from our monitoring room that rooms which had been vacated needed to be cleaned, leaving us with *ten rooms in the first hour*, and despite my supervisor saying he would look into what happened, it keeps happening. \n\nIt seems like a universal constant in the world of work: first shift does jack all, second has to do their job for them, third has to do what second missed after having to do two jobs at once.
