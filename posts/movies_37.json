I don't know what it is about these movies, but they certainly are satisfying.\n\nMovies I have watched recently include Spotlight, The Post, Lincoln Lawyer, All the President's Men and Zodiac. \n\nOf these, Spotlight and All the President's Men were my favorite. Particularly All the President's men, although I do wish we got a little montage at the end of it with some of the fallout resulting from their investigation and reporting.\n\nAny suggestions for similar movies?",

I'm not sure if anyone understands what I'm saying, but is there a reason why this happens? And can you find exactly what you are looking for in these movies/TV shows?",

From the buck tooth to the broken English to the amount of xenophobic cliches, the character was a mistake from top to bottom. Casting Mickey Rooney just made it a lot worse. And the director's regret doesn't mean much when he directed that performance. You can't just express regret after the movie came out and that performance received a ton of well-deserved scorn. \n\nIt does overshadow the movie's worth, if I'm honest, but then I was never that into BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. I always thought Audrey Hepburn was miscast and that the only reason the movie is beloved is because of Hepburn's fashions and look. It's so odd how the movie tries to avoid bringing up the fact that Holly is an escort as they prettify it as someone being chic and having a lot of parties. George Peppard's role as a kept man to Patricia Neal is a different story.",

His filmography is objectively varied, taking character roles while *actively* filming Spider-Man yet he’s not necessarily seen as credible as his peers.\n\nIs it because Spider-Man such a popular character? Or that he’s played Spider-Man the longest? Is it because his other movies weren’t received well? Ignorance? The role of Spider-Man itself?\n\niirc Andrew Garfield had a similar critique. Near universal praise for his performances in the Social Network and Never Let Me Go, played Spider-Man and then only after he was let go that people finally saw him as legitimate again.",

I saw him first in No Country for Old Men when it came out then a year or two later saw this and I remember thinking there's no way this is the same guy. \n\nLove the movie though.

He was a leading man by the end of the 90s and had a string of hits only to hit a rough patch when \"Bennifer\" was a thing. Flop after flop (Gigli, Jersey Girl) to name a few and suddenly he's doing roles in ensemble films like  Smokin Aces, He's Just Not That Into You, State of Play, Extract. \n\nI had even presumed his career was near its last legs but he bounced back. Directed Gone Girl starring his brother, then did The Town which was a hit especially for Jeremy Renner. He followed up with Argo which got him an Oscar and the role of Batman. While he was preparing for that, Gone Girl became a big hit.\n\nSure in recent years he's taken some noticeable flops but he's still a leading man.",

Just an assumption but still. \n3) Mission Impossible Film Franchise. \nNow I know that Ethan Hunt is among one of the most iconic role for Tom Cruise but this Film Franchise was started in 1996 and 2023 is going on , that mean this film franchise has been going on for 27 years now. 27 years is a very long time so I am assuming that this film franchise is also coming to an end.",

But dark comedy doesn't necessarily entail punching down and attacking vulnerable people. In fact, I think that's the lowest and least imaginative form of dark comedy. Some examples of dark comedy I enjoy are:\n\nPortal 2, with fatalistic comedy that generates comedy from the blasse attitude with which GLaDOS, the game's artificial intelligence antagonist and later deuteragonist, treats her attempts to kill you, relying on comic underreaction to or deadpan delivery of horrific threats.\n\nBoJack Horseman, where the dark comedy comes from the relatable tribulations and failures of a man attempting to recover from mental illness, as well as the raw political satire that uses taboo topics like mass shootings to poke fun at people in power (such as rich studio executives who politicize shootings to protect their film projects.\n\nInvader ZIM, where the comedy is similar to Portal in that it stems from using horror tropes but then comically underselling them to the point of treating travesties, horror, and absurdity as mundane and everyday.\n\nBeing John Malkovich, in which the comedy comes from the horror of people commercializing access to your mind/comedy.\n\nI particularly like dark comedy that uses absurdism to make light of horror. Are there any movies I should watch if I like this style of comedy? And I should add, I am obviously not receptive to \"dark comedy\" that relies on punching down at minorities, so anything that uses racism or any other isms as a crux isn't for me.",

It's a poll-only subreddit where you can post the name of a movie and other users can vote on whether they recommend it based on their experiences.\n\nI think it could be a really helpful resource for anyone looking for a new movie to watch. Plus, it's always interesting to see how different people feel about the same film.\n\nI'd love for you to check it out and contribute your own recommendations! Just search for \"WYRTM\" on Reddit or \\[click here\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/WYRTM/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WYRTM/)).\n\nThanks for your time, and I hope to see you over at WYRTM soon!",
