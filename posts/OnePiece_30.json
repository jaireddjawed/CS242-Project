        "text": "# For reference: The last time we got a full view, single panel spread was in chapter 800. For the grand fleet, at the end of Dressrosa. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7iits8cmrnla1.png?width=1901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d7df2aceb8bcb35d75199023f5872ae668e3a44\n\nPLEASE try to engage with what I'm saying.\n\n# 1)  The truth about devil fruits, 1069 \n\nDr. Vegapunk is the old, wise wizard we've been waiting to meet for 600+ chapters of the series, and he delivers on much of that hype with one of the most important reveals the series will ever have... with a whole pages worth of content awkwardly wedged in between. This is *notoriously* bad paneling, I doubt I need to explain why. Anything. Literally anything focusing solely on HIM and HIS expression would be more worthwhile than having our attention drawn elsewhere. ANYTHING to signify that **the information being told to us is more worthwhile than an Enies lobby fight callback**. The reference (pretty much everything in full red) was NOT worth it; the themes of the original Lucci fight (and this one) are ENTIRELY divorced from what Vegapunk is saying, outside of seeing Luffy's awakened form. \n\nTo help illustrate this, I struck out every unnecessary panel, with less opacity for the less egregious. If you notice, I actually like the shot on the top left. Luffy's expression actually adds to the words framing it. THAT'S the sort of thing you keep on a page as important as this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng90oc59vnla1.jpg?width=2200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6279beacf1dd891723eeeee32b2789d941cb98c7\n\n[I'm not joking. An ENTIRE PAGE has been inserted, with even more reaction panels than the original.](https://preview.redd.it/27cd9f0pnsla1.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44a3ee6b9c139766144b9d219c325b0dce253623)\n\nEven the previous chapter had a simple, impactful example of what I'm describing. When Vegapunk describes his dream to Luffy. The poses, angles, and background lead you towards the speech bubbles- the truly important aspect- while still being interesting to look at unto themselves.\n\n[This is 1\\/3rd of a page](https://preview.redd.it/9cisl7oe4ola1.jpg?width=1037&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=79eb6d35c17c6487cb1a0a31a3d6577772cce9cb)\n\nWhen I think about someone relatively uninvolved with the series searching \"devil fruits explained\" and realize they'd see the first page, I feel something between pity and embarrassment. This is simply not a consideration at any point in the series beforehand, this is the type of thing an editor or proofreader stops from detracting from the ideas on the page in the review process. \n\n# 2) The death of Luffy, 1043\n\nI say it once I say it a thousand times:  I fully believe that 2 pages squandered the remaining tension Wano had. Try to remember: In the week of chapter 1040, we were left with the satisfaction of Kidd and Law doing the impossible, beating a yonko, with the narrator himself marking the monumental defeat. All that was left was for Luffy to do the same. Then, as of 1042, a devastating attack was dealt to Luffy- with the exact severity of the situation unclear. **Leaving 1043 to not only contextualize said previous week, but the break week directly afterwards.** \n\nAnd... for 15 whole pages, we feel utter defeat. The narrator now works against us, marking the victory of Kaido as he finally descends from the rooftop. Luffy is presumed dead. Kidd, Law, Zoro, Sanji, and Killer are now too weak to fight him. The allied forces are on the backfoot. Yamato and Momonosuke steel their resolve and decide that it's better to die fighting than live kneeling. Nami is the only one who still believes Luffy is alive (fuck you Chopper I guess but sure) and...\n\n[\\(obviously I can only use what I was given\\)](https://preview.redd.it/g1rlcpjqwnla1.jpg?width=722&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e3edfc66a015114b046af882fa5817037c184a3b)\n\n**but instead, in the last 2 pages of 1043, Luffy pops a smile; as Zuneisha eagerly announces \"Joyboy has returned\".** If Oda had held his hand for ***exactly*** **2 pages** there’d be **2-3 WEEKS** of real-world time where ACTUAL tension would be felt to the fullest extent it could. However, because 1042 was the \"intended cliffhanger” (one that failed because that SAME ARC showed Kinemon surviving the attack that killed Luffy, making the narration from 1043 necessary) many were only be able to feel the tension for 15 pages of a single chapter, before it was alleviated entirely at the end. 15 pages in the readers mind, while 3 weeks outside of it were recontextualized as the circumstances for Luffy's awakening, rather than the climax of the arc. I fully believe that most of the complaints about tension during Wano would be alleviated with a simple, one panel spread. Not a new ending, not another fight, not the raid completely failing, not ZKK- the simple shift of 2 pages, and the reinforcement of Luffy's death. Marking the corpse of the protagonist as **the first single panel spread in 200 chapters**. \n\nIf you think it's too gruesome, good news!! The VERY next chapter, page technically, will undo it!! If you forgot, it actually happened! I actually just showed you a panel where it was drawn!! \n\nSeriously, would it be so bad if the next chapter started more like this?\n\n*Processing img 7oztz40sisla1...*\n\nPersonally, I see this as a genuine editing mistake. Not my stupid pieced together edits (obviously). Rather the idea that the shift of 2 panels could singlehandedly decide whether or not the audience feels what the characters in the story are feeling. That a manga chapter could have elevated the audiences experience with a story, rather than being its page limit.\n\n# 3) The new scabbards, the end of Wano, 1057\n\nThis was an INCREDIBLY good shot to end the arc on. Yamato has finally found freedom and acceptance, Momonosuke calmly shows his maturity after 10 years of publication with the audience, Tama- who we now know is a Kurozumi- signifies both the hopeful future of Wano and the ending of the cycle of hatred and bigotry of its past, the scabbards we've followed for so long are celebrating their efforts, the gaps made by those lost are noticeable... yet fulfilled, etc. I'm completely serious. This is an incredibly poignant yet effective way to deliver on the ending to an arc like Wano. IMO, it deserved to be more than **1/3rd of a page.**\n\n*Processing img m090muhxsnla1...*\n\nso I know JUST what to remove to make room for it!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dup8q9f4snla1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e95a5321bef7941d1dd7fcd6ca8ef8a4c0d01fee\n\nAgain, please hear me out. The Hiyori pun shown above, the 3 act structure of wano, the whole thing related to the new teacher relaying the tale of Kozuki Oden, etc- are all references the author is making to **rakugo, a traditional Japanese performance where 1 person acts out a story with only a paper fan**. In 1037, we even see a character designed after rakugo performer [Kosanji Yanagiya](https://twitter.com/newworldartur/status/1482735266171432960?s=20)\\- who Oda has publicly mentioned admiring. The propagandistic teacher is actually more of a performer- acting out the events of Wano- that’s why both him and Hiyori hold out a fan the way they do. The sort of “cathartic” or “ironic” line delivery at the end that Hiyori’s attire, behavior, and words reference seem to be a traditional part of it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5pe9qjv6snla1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=adff1f65aeb89e639733a7d4eefea5744dfc95c9\n\n**However, with all the love and good intention the author had in mind, it was not worth it.** I'm not boring you with the criticisms, you've decided how you feel and how you're going to react to me disliking it, and I don't care. **The fact that the ending of an arc had to clarified in an SBS is an acknowledgement that it was confusing in Japanese as well, it's not a translation issue**. It's a reference that pleased the author- one that must be ignored outside of that context, lest it detract from the themes of the story at large. Removing it from said story is simply the natural follow-though.\n\n# 4) \"Sun God Nika\", 1044\n\nI'm going to mostly continue off of the second point I made. I really enjoyed the reveal of Gear 5, but the name change definitely came at an awkward time. So to change it...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzf585oqoola1.jpg?width=1146&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=878308022d9b923d4bc298a682ba879e3def62b6\n\nI’m just cutting the Gorosei convo. “Sun god Nika” isn’t a name that deserves this type of explanation, **not yet**. It’s an idea that was first mentioned **26 chapters before chapter 1044** with no immediate relevance to what we’re seeing. AFTER seeing it's presence, AFTER defeating the world's strongest creature, AFTER Kaido's incessant whining about how Luffy's awakening isn't \"following the rules\", AFTER having Luffy's heart stop in a high stakes sky battle for the liberation of an island while thousands of its inhabitants unknowingly pray towards him for freedom- THEN, at most then, you can have a reveal about the main character's fruit secretly being the most ridiculous power in the world. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9obx4y2qola1.jpg?width=973&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=13c9622acce5b8132e85822cfefa44f105ed70e8\n\nBut by frontloading it you make all of that suspense- 10 YEARS worth of suspense- the explanation for that reveal, not the other way around. You shift the conversation from Luffy vs Kaido to Luffy's awakening, and have to work backwards to put Kaido back on his level. You bring up the obvious questions that are of no relevance to this arc or fight- \"Wait so has Luffy always had god powers?\", \"What are Luffy's powers now?\", \"What does Luffy being a God say about his past accomplishments?\", \"Has Luffy been possessed?\", \"Was a god really made up specifically for this story and only mentioned more than 1000 chapters in? \", \"What does this change?\", \"What doesn't this change?\", etcetera etcetera.\n\nOne of the reasons I like Gear 5 is that it works almost EXACTLY as we can understand a \"normal\" paramecia awakening of the rubber fruit would work- outside of the appearance change. **Without knowing what it is, we would still understand Gear 5.** That it isn't necessarily a retcon; by being a human model zoan it effectively makes Luffy's awakening a different fruit than the one he had at every point beforehand, as all of the new abilities are and *always were* restricted to the transformation. In fact literally every character *besides the Gorosei* from 1044-1069 had to understand it as a power of the rubber fruit. Luffy STILL doesn't think it's anything else. It IS a fruit with 2 names, not a fake one and a real one. But by overhearing the above conversation, leaving the shores of Wano for the sake of the Gorosei vaguely explaining Nika *on OUR behalf*, we stop being able to identify with the now comparatively small conflict of the arc, and become disconnected to the thoughts of the characters. It WASN'T intended to happen, which is especially clear now that we know the answers to so many of the initial questions. That's my real problem with handling it this way.\n\nImagine (*really, imagine*) learning about the original name of the Gomu Gomu no Mi for the first time from Dr. Vegapunk himself, in 1069. Where the tone was far more indicative of there being **no actual sun god, and no distinction from his other rubber powers**, rather that the fruit is the dream of freedom itself. Nika, a rubber warrior, was a myth so prominent amongst the enslaved that their collective desire for freedom manifested as his rubber body. This isn't even a \"lesser of 2 evils\" thing, I genuinely enjoy this chapter and what it adds to 1044 retrospectively. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib4psudsrnla1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=30b844b591f530eed0e88b9fd8ce4ae97226ff47\n\nI wanted to move this upwards in the list, but the Gorosei convo does have utility in explaining that Kaido, touted as the World's Strongest Creature, was defeated by the “most ridiculous\" devil fruit. I can legitimately see how digesting Kaido's defeat would be more difficult without this. It also lays out things that the above panel misses much more plainly and concisely. It would not be as simple of a \"cut and paste\" as my other 3 examples were. \n\nHowever, I think the shock of this reveal was still too indigestible for many people, and I genuinely believe much of it could have been avoided easily. *Shamefully* easily. Moving everything the Gorosei said (around 1 1/2 pages, maybe even 1 since it won’t need the segue from discussing Guernica and Kaido) to another chapter, even 1069 itself, would not be difficult. No less so than 1044 was. However, I hope you can understand why I believe the pros of delaying it far outweigh the cons.\n\n# I lied, I don’t have a 5th one. \n\nI’m not deciding this shit arbitrarily and choosing another moment to \"fill a reddit post quota\". At this point single panel spreads are best if used sparingly given everything that needs to be covered before the end of the series. **The next one WILL have impact, and I hope what it portrays delivers on it.**\n\nIt is simply obvious that panel space shouldn't have been allotted the way it was during the moments above. By now I'm inclined to believe the editor from early Onigashima to recent Egghead chapters was a \"yes man\" who never spoke up about cutting what the story didn’t need. We got every raw, unfiltered idea that could be packed into Wano week after week with no regard for how this affects the pacing. In some ways this may have helped, in many ways it did not. \n\nDorry, Broggy, and Shanks have a two-panel spread from the newest chapter (1076) that is a great example of what I'm saying done in a pleasing way. *Zoro meeting Kaku again on egghead* had more satisfying panel space than the monumental moments above. **It is not impossible OR unreasonable to ask for more focused and spacious panels going forward.** Even if it's not strictly one singular panel, there are dozens of ways to make this satisfying. I'll leave you with a few examples of a few multi-panel spreads done incredibly well, at least better than the moments listed above:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3e6wdencunla1.png?width=2133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b15751c011c74a1bc0cd1f475c96b212b59215b0\n\n[\\(Severely underrated tbh\\)](https://preview.redd.it/11jz4dxgunla1.png?width=2133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c26762bbde77f1a267b1d3caf3633385aa24659c)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xa4m0k5s8ola1.png?width=2133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=88e93c1c5d04be5ea8cb621e2809f11866801ffa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9swn5q2aola1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0604cf2af8bcf2b596a5240d80a5df057a593050\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2v0f2oa29ola1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2222e69e45a75c490c52fb186265eff5cef57b9\n\n[EVEN IF YOU CRAMP PANELS, AT LEAST DO THINGS LIKE THESE](https://preview.redd.it/t1gp0zvz8ola1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=575fbbd2333ef4128d8f01f1a3fbead7c49dbce8)\n\n[I want at least one more spread like this though, with no background.

Instead of \"wasting\" time on a brand new character like Yamato and her relationship with everyone else, I think it would have made things a lot more streamlined and tidy if Tama were the person with whom Ace shares his \"children of hated people\"-relationship. Sure, it's not the same as being the child of Kaidou, but I do think it would have made the arc a whole lot more three-dimensional. \n\nLet the people of Wano/the Scabbards already know that she's a Kurozumi or let them find out sometime during the arc and then be like \"Whatever! We don't care! You're not Orochi!\" or something similar. Leaving this whole plot point unaddressed feels kinda off and I would have preferred if we at least got one or two interactions out of it. Heck, you could even make a \"Kin'emon-gag\" out of it where everyone BUT Kin'emon had already guessed that she's a Kurozumi but that it didn't matter to them. \n\nFurthermore, I'm not really all that keen on how her abilities were handled. I know for a fact that I'm not the only one who found it odd that one of the good guys has the ability to take over the will of other people, so switching it up a bit could have been a bit better. I don't know exactly how that could have gone, but maybe instead of Tama just becoming the master of the Gifters, maybe her Kibi dango just make them more easy to persuade or somewhat light-headed. That way she can influence them more with her actual personality instead of her broken Devil Fruit powers. Or make the Gifters that eat the dangos go drunk from them or something, that way, instead of becoming full-fledged allies during the war, they become trouble for both sides as they attack simply everyone. \n\nAfter the war, maybe let her have a conversation with Momo all on her own where they talk about their different family members (Orochi for Tama and Oden and Sukiyaki for Momo) and how they failed at governing Wano. With Orochi actively running it into the ground, Oden not wanting to rule for several long years, and Sukiyaki unable to stop the persecution of the Kurozumi family, it's now up to them to lead Wano into a new future without discrimination and prejudice. \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10suysq/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_hawkins_in/) \\- Hawkins\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10v431h/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_the_kid_and/) \\- Kid and Heart Pirates\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10x4ha4/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_orochi_in/) \\- Orochi\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10yw5h6/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_zoro_in/) \\- Zoro\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/111isx9/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_yamato_in/) \\- Yamato\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11b1wt7/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_franky_in/) \\- Franky",

        "text": "Ok, I have to get this off my chest.\n\nI'm fully aware how many nonsensical things there are in One Piece, even past the \"normal\" fantasy elements that make the story possible.\n\nI don't mean the Devil Fruits, giants, fishmen, etc., but I mean the really wacky stuff like Enel flying a massive ark to the literal moon, or Pappag being a regular starfish that just willed himself into being anthropomorphic, then starting a world-famous fashion line, but still remaining Camie's pet?\n\n\n\nThere's one thing in particular though that really chaps my booty cheeks: Ace was in his mom's womb for 2 YEARS? Just by sheer force of will? My wife has had 2 pregnancies, and if she would've held off one more day past her labor, she would've felt like dying right then!\n\nAlso consider the longest pregnancy on record is 375 days. Thats already remarkable enough, but now DOUBLE THAT. Rouge held Ace for literally TWICE AS LONG AS THE WORLD RECORD. Not only was he held for that long, but narratively she is trying to hide her pregnancy for that long. I should not need to explain how truly impossible that would be.\n\nAnd all this for what? To make the point that she was hiding him until people didn't suspect him being Roger's kid? I get there are gaps in the story that Oda didn't explain, but couldn't she just have hid his lineage or lied and said it was someone else's kid? Why was this plot element even introduced? This just makes up a fantastical element for the point of being unrealistic - just to show how strong she was or something? Why not just make her hold Ace for an extra month or two and call it quits while it would still be mildly reasonable - albeit unusual?\n\nLike I said, I'm unsure why this one in particular bothers me so much, but I just can't get my head around it. I pretty much had to just say \"ok\" and move on and forget about how stupid that was, but I still remember it from time to time. The only way I could see it ever being solved is through some retcon of \"she had a Devil Fruit\" or \"willpower (haki?) is the strongest hidden power in One Piece.  Consider Pappag's strong willpower turning him into a human-starfish hybrid. Willpower is so strong that it can have a woman hold her child in for a downright ridiculous amount of time\". Until that time comes, it'll be an annoying element to me. I also realize that time will probably never come, unless in an SBS (future or a past one I never read).\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

        "text": "We'll have to start this timeline at the Grand Line, because the whole East Blue Saga (Romance Dawn, Orange Town, Syrup Village,  Baratie, Arlong Park) except for Loguetown is impossible to map out as Oda doesn't state how much time has passed at all (except for an occasional night passing that we know of). I'll just give you what's reasonable in-universe timeline for the East Blue Saga in my opinion:\n\n* We know the birthday of each strawhat and we also know that none of them had a birthday before the timeskip. Based on the following part which has the Grand Line at around 90 days, the East Blue Saga has to be shorter than 9 months. \n* The strawhats didn't travel on a straight line, just sailed around quite a bit, didn't have their next destination set all the time and didn't have Nami navigating for the most part, but they also didn't stay long at any island. Considering the size of the four Blues and how long travelling the Grand Line with Nami and better planning took, I'd say everything between 3 and 6 months is a fair assumption for the East Blue Saga.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, we'll get to the actual timeline. There are a few times where Oda mentioned that travelling form island to island took \"several days.\" This is where I have to make assumptions, just as a heads up that a bit of headcanon's still involved:\n\n# Grand Line\n\n**Day 1**: **Loguetown**, **Reverse Mountain** and **Whisky Peak** all happen on the same day.\n\n**Day 2**: They leave Whisky Peak the next morning.\n\n**Day 2 - 7**: \"Several days\" pass til they reach **Little Garden.** I'm assuming 6 days for \"several days.\"\n\n**Day 8**: The next day they are attacked by Wapol.\n\n**Day 9**: The day after they reach **Drum Island** (3rd day of Nami's illness according to Kureha, Chess says he met the strawhats a day ago). They leave at night.\n\n**Day 9-14**: 5 days pass until they meet Mr. 2; the strawhats are low on supplies.\n\n**Day 15-18**: On the day they arrive, Zorro says they haven't eaten in 4 days.\n\n**Day 18**: They arrive and sleep at Yuba (Day 18) \n\n**Day 19**: They travel the  desert. \n\n**Day 20**: Operation Utopia and end of the civil war take place.\n\n**Day 21-22**: Luffy sleeps two days.\n\n**Day 23**: Luffy wakes up. They leave Alabasta at midnight (day 23/24).\n\n**Day 24**: They arrive at **Jaya** the same day they left Alabasta.\n\n**Day 25**: The next day they reach **Skypeia**. \n\n**Day 26**: The next day Luffy defeats Enel. \n\n**Day 27-31**: \"Several days of  partying\" follow. I'll assume 5 days. \n\n**Day 31**: They steal gold and leave Skypeia.\n\n**Day 32:** Upon landing they are attacked by the same sea monkeys as the Fanged Toad Pirates, so the Davy Back fight at **Long Ring Long Land** happens at the same day. \n\n**Day 32-36**: They spend 4 more days there before leaving.\n\n**Day 39**: 3 days later they arrive at **Water 7.**\n\n**Day 39-40**: It's 2 days of Water 7. \n\n**Day 41**: One day of **Enies Lobby** with them returning to Water 7 later that day. RIP Merry. \n\n**Day 42-43**: 2 days rest before Garp arrives and Luffy wakes up. \n\n**Day 44**: The next day Franky starts building the Sunny. \n\n**Day 46**: Franky said it'll take him 5 days, but he finishes 2 days early; he also joins. SUUUUPER.\n\n**Day 46-52**: \"Several days pass\" until they arrive at **Thriller Bark**.  I'll assume another week due to the distance. \n\n**Day 53**: Next day is midnight hunt with shadows being returned pre sunrise. \n\n**Day 54**: All strawhats sleep a whole day. \n\n**Day 55**: Brook joins. They party for two days before leaving Thriller Bark.\n\n**Day 56**: They leave Thriller Bark.\n\n**Day 57-61**: \"Several  days pass\" before they arrive at the Red Line (I'll assume another 5 days cause it's not that far).\n\n**Day 61**: The strawhats have one of their worst days ever at **Sabaody**.\n\n**Day 62**: Luffy lands on **Amazon Lilly**. Luffy sleeps til the next day.\n\n**Day 63**: Luffy spends a day at Amazon Lily and parties at night; according to elder Nyon the auction house incident was 2 days ago.\n\n**Day 64**: Luffy and Hancock leave for Impel Down, it'll take them 5 days. 6 days until Ace's execution. Garp visits Ace.\n\n**Day 68**: Luffy infiltrates **Impel Down,** but gets clapped by Magellan. Ivan's miracle treatment starts (\n\n**Day 69**: Luffy wakes up at 8 am the next day. **Marineford** starts around 12 am. Yes, Ace dies on Day 69.\n\n**Day 83**: 2 weeks pass before Rayleigh meets Luffy on Amazon Lily **post-war**.\n\n**Day 89**: On  Franky's last chapter pre timeskip, Gorilla says that Franky has been missing for less than a month, meaning that the timeskip at latest starts at **Day 89.**\n\nThe Grand Line took them about 3 months. \n\n# 2 years timeskip.\n\n# New World\n\n**Day 1 post ts**: Return to Sabaody was about 3 hours.  Arriving at Fishman Island and defeating Hody happened on the same day.  Party all night.\n\n**Day 2**: Next day they leave FMI and travel to Punk Hazard and capture Caesar. \n\n**Day 3**: The  morning after they arrive at Dressrosa and kick Doffy's ass. \n\n**Day 3-5**: Luffy rests for 2 days (thanks Fuji) before they leave the next morning.\n\n**Day 5-12:**: Travelling  to Zou took 1 week. Climbing up the leg took the whole night of Day 12.\n\n**Day 13**: They arrive on a full Moon at Zou.\n\n**Day 14**: They form an alliance (Day 14) and stay for about 23 days..\n\n**Day 37**: ...after which they leave for Tottoland.\n\n**Day 38-40**: From Zoo to  Cacao Island it was 3 days. They had supplies for a week which didn't last long due to Luffy. \n\n**Day 41**: Next day they arrive at WCI  (travel takes one day according to Pekoms in chapter 827), the events there take 4 days total:\n\n**Day 41**: fighting Cracker,\n\n**Day 42**: defeating Cracker, Sanji beats up Luffy, Luffy is captured, Jinbei frees Luffy,\n\n**Day 43**: WEDDING CAKE, I mean: The tea party is crashed. Day 43 also is a confirmed full moon.\n\n**Day 44**: Luffy defeats Katakuri and the strawhats escape and start their journey to Wano.\n\n**Day 58**: Revolutionary commanders are introduced while clapping Pinkbeard.\n\n**Day 59:** Luffy reaches Wano, reunites with the others and gets clapped by Kaido.\n\n**Day 60**: Luffy gets thrown into Udon and Reverie starts.\n\n**Day 61**: Day 2 of Reverie.\n\n**Day 62**: Day 3 of Reverie.\n\n**Day 63**: Day 4 of Reverie. Sabo and revolutionary commanders encounter Fuji  and Ryo. BM arrives at Wano. Moria invades BB's territory. Sanji fights  Page One.\n\n**Day 64**: Day 5 of Reverie. Zorro vs Killer, BM starts moving to Udon\n\n**Day 65**: Day 6 of Reverie. Yasuie is executed (RIP). Luffy takes control of  Udon. Queen captures BM and BM starts fighting Kaido later that day.\n\n**Day 66**: the Reverie ends.\n\n**Day 68:** BM and Kaido stop fighting and announce their plans for an alliance.\n\n**Day 73**: The raid takes place on the next Full Moon. BM and Kaido are defeated. This is also where Jinbei officially joined.\n\nDay 80: A week later Luffy wakes up and Ryokugyu arrives.\n\nI might continue this once Egghead's finished and we're given enough hints.

        "text": "Now most people theorize Monkey D. Dragon has a devil fruit due to him saving luffy with a lightning bolt. Now though it is One Piece, this is a big coincidence. But I found even more proof to this fact. During the episode where dragon saves Sabo and brings him back to the ship (forgot the ep number), When Dragon lands on the boat, there is a small whirlwind around him. This could mean he was levitating with wind using a weather devil fruit to fly to his ship, small detail i somehow noticed.\n\n[https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxo95g\\_LctT6x4xkVowxuanOCOxTXHpa-3](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxo95g_LctT6x4xkVowxuanOCOxTXHpa-3)",

I know that she clearly knows stuff but can't that be just because she's old af and nothing more? Why must every old character be either a member of rocks or affiliated to Roger? I honestly think it's a good thing that she's just a very knowledgeable and smart old lady that maybe travelled the world as a doctor and that's it. No rock, no roger, no revolutionaries, just a single individual that figured things out without making big moves and is now seeing what happens, it really fits her character.",

        "text": " \n\nBased on the information and clues that we have about One Piece so far, here's a theory:\n\nOne Piece is not a physical treasure, but rather a symbol of the ultimate goal of every pirate: the freedom to live life on their own terms. The true nature of One Piece lies in the journey and the friends that are made along the way, rather than the destination.\n\nThe Laugh Tale or Raftel, where One Piece is said to be located, is not a place where the treasure can be found, but rather a place where the true spirit of adventure and camaraderie can be experienced. The final island that Gol D. Roger spoke of is not a physical place, but rather a state of mind that can only be achieved by those who have truly embraced the pirate lifestyle and are willing to live their lives on their own terms.\n\nThe Poneglyphs, which contain the history of the world and the location of Raftel, are not just a means to find One Piece, but rather a key to understanding the true meaning of the pirate journey. The World Government, which seems to be hiding the truth about the Void Century and the true history of the world, is actually trying to suppress the true spirit of adventure and freedom that One Piece represents.\n\nThe Yonko, the four most powerful pirate captains in the world, are not just rivals in the search for One Piece, but also symbols of different ways of living the pirate life. Each Yonko has a unique philosophy and approach to piracy, and the ultimate goal of One Piece is not to defeat them, but rather to find a way to coexist with them and respect their different ways of life.\n\nIn summary, One Piece is not a physical treasure, but rather a symbol of the ultimate goal of every pirate: the freedom to live life on their own terms. The true nature of One Piece lies in the journey and the friends that are made along the way, and the final island that Gol D. Roger spoke of is not a physical place, but rather a state of mind that can only be achieved by those who have truly embraced the pirate lifestyle.",

Because from this one appearance here we know seceral things.\n\n1. Dorry and Broggy have met Yasopp (Fuck that deadbeat) and possibly know that he's Usopp's father and are aware that Usopp saved Oimo and Kashii from Enies Lobby!\n\n2. They are probably aware of the Straw Hat grand fleet thanks to their connections to the New Giant Warrior pirates. And would be so proud of how Usopp garnered such a large following behind him.\n\n3. They are aware that one of their previous captains were killed by Big Mom (I wonder how that would make them feel knowing Kidd was one of the people to take her down)\n\n4. Their reunion would give Usopp a heart attack! Just imagine, all the giants he befriended over time, he gained respect from both the old and the new generation of giants just like that! He automatically has his own giant army!\n\n5. There will be jokes about Usopp and Sanji having their own fully fleshed out arcs and backstories while Zoro is limited to an SBS section.\n\n6. Oh yeah, and Yassop... I don't like Yassop, but I'd like to see how his meeting with Ussop turns out.\n\nUsopp is my favourite character, so I have a lot of expectations for the Elbaf arc, and one of them being that Usopp becomes known as (The King of Giants) I have no doubt in my mind its going to be an incredible arc and I'm looking forward to it!",
