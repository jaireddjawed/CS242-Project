When I try to shop around to see if there are better deals, the prices on oil changes are somehow elusive.  For my last oil change, I went to a place that had a sign saying \"$29 oil changes\" yet when they ring me up at the counter the bill is over $100.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrankly I am sick of paying so much for what appears to be a pretty simple job.  I've changed my own oil on my motorcycle before and that was very easy.  Should I just start doing my own oil changes on my truck as well?  Any advice is appreciated.",

So, I looked to see if you could freeze pumpkin because I don‚Äôt have and couldn‚Äôt afford a bunch of canning supplies. It took my several days to get all the pumpkins home (I also grabbed all the little decorative gourds) and then a few dedicated weekends of roasting and pureeing the pumpkins. Then I measured them out into different amounts, labeled the bags accordingly, and filled up a whole drawer in my freezer. I roasted about 2/3 of the seeds, with different seasoning combos, and saved the other 1/3  for planting. It cost me about $3 in extra ziplock bags. And I still have plenty left. My husband thought I was being ridiculous until I was able to easily pull some out to thaw to throw together some pumpkin muffins for a last minute get together. Sometimes my attempts don‚Äôt work out but I can honestly say this time was a real winner!!!",

I currently have a studio apartment and I only own a small car so I can't fit everything in my vehicle or do the move with a trailer. \n\nI am thinking that a PODS type service might make sense, but they are very pricey. I'd like to get the move done for $1k or less, but I don't know if that's viable. \n\nI will be doing all the packing and heavy lifting by myself, but I don't own anything I can't lift safely (no heavy furniture, etc.). Considering selling a lot of my belongings because I'm not sure if it's actually cost effective to move them, but I want to explore options before I go that route.",

Now I wanted to upgrade to a bigger model with the grill option. I found the Ninja Foodi Grill for $130 CAD. But as I got it home, I realized it was missing the grill part (hence the discount). I sat on hold for about 10 mins and then used the online chat and got a hold of a rep. She‚Äôs sending me a new grill piece free of charge since it was missing from the box. \n\nIt still works and my old one still works, so I‚Äôm not losing anything. I just have to wait a few weeks for the grill part. But now I have a travel air fryer for just me and a bigger air fryer for cooking at home.",
