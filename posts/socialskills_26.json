Recently tho in my P.E class atleast a nice group of people keep including me.\n\nThat being said my P.E class is 1 week drivers Ed then P.E  (we alternate) and when we're not in P.E I end up having no one talking to me. My teachers nice and talks with everyone; she was asking me about what I do and what not. She then asked me who my group of friends in the school were and I straight up told her I have none; she then asked if I'm just not that into people and I said I was indifferent; she then reiterated that I'm not that into people.\n\nThis isn't true I'm just really nervous; even then I'd say I'm more introverted but, I don't like spending every second of my day alone. Stuff like this happens a lot and I'm not sure why. When I was in elementary/middle school people said the same things about me (I had friends then I'm in HS in a completely different area where I know no one tho). \n\nI don't know what I'm doing wrong. I do like talking to people; I do want friends I'm not sure what I'm doing that makes me so unapproachable tho; example in other classes with quiet kids people will eventually make the first move and talk to someone yet no one does that to me; with the exception of P.E and I'm just not sure why.\n\nI don't think I look off or anything; I don't think anyone's would be off put by my presence yet no one seems to talk to me. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong any advice on what to do? Not sure what I'm looking for advice on but I genuinely don't understand why no one talks to me \n\n(on the rare occasions I have talked to people no one's disliked me or anything so it's not like I'm a massive dick no one likes so I'm not sure what it could be)",

I felt a bit embarrassed and stupid, plus he said it in a weird awkward way, which makes me think that other people have talked about it. But at the same time I appreciated him telling me, because I then realised that most of the stuff I try and joke about I don’t even find funny , I just think it’ll make others laugh and make them like me more. But occasionally when I’m not even trying people will be on tears with laughter. Does anyone have any tips on how to stop being like this and how to stop worrying about if people like me or not ?\nThanks.",

Few assholes will find this opportunity exaggerate certain things about me and to blame everything out to be my fault\n\nI can blame society for this but, thinking again, if many people do treat me like this, and I'm the common denominator, I'm partial if not mostly responsible for this at all.\n\nI think that even though I don't socialize much, when I do have much lower inhibition. I don't read the room quite well which can cause people to feel unconsciously irritated. Their interactions with me deals more with their tolerance then from genuine appraisal or sharing of value.

My only justification for it is that I hate waste.\n\nI've asked a similar question of my friends before on a smaller scale, and the answer, of course, is to always politely accept the gift. But then what? Am I allowed to donate it or throw it away? Of course not. You're supposed to eventually \"follow-up\" on the gift by mentioning how it's brought you value. These politeness lessons as a kid weren't lost on me, but everything underlying did.\n\nI can't even think of how to phrase this nicely: If I receive a gift (one that I never indicated interest in) as a surprise, I'm not interested in the gift, and the gift is not returnable, is there any recourse besides accepting the gesture and eating the guilt? I appreciate that I have friends that think of me, but I feel bad that I can't use these gifts. \n\nA specific example would be a card game I play with a friend. He'll occasionally have store credit leftover from trading stuff in, and, instead of saving it for later use, he'll pick me up a cool-looking promo version of a card or something. But it'll be a card that's not playable or one I wouldn't ever use.\n\nI can't turn it down, because that's insulting to my friend. I can't dispose of it, because that's rude to the gift-giver (and that would weigh on me). \n\nI'm lost and don't know what to do.",

Today’s prompt was **‘Ask a stranger how their day is going’**\n\n**Before:**\n\nI’ve been doing this for a while so it’s a lot less intimidating. At the start of this experiment, the idea of start a conversation from cold was so intimidating but now I’ve done it a few times, it’s almost second nature to be looking for conversations and opportunities to speak with people.\n\n**Experience:**\n\nI was waiting for a train this morning and saw a girl my age. I think before I would have gone into my own world but I swallowed my anxiety (or as much as I could muster) and said ‘Good Morning, How’s your day going’ which opened up a nice conversation.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe more I do this, the less intimidating it is, the better I get at it and the more satisfying it is. I’m almost looking forward to the harder challenges I’ve set myself in the future which is fascinating given a week ago, the idea of starting a conversation with someone would have made me a nervous wreck.\n\nI'm also really glad I've made it process orientated and slowly driven up the difficulty instead of making it an unsurmountable task, it feels like a steady progression which I can hang on to.\n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

        "text": "This has been my biggest jump probably. The idea of this forum often is that we are all here to learn from each other. But after quite some years, with intermittent pauses, on here, I realised that I wasn't really integrating the stuff. I'm a big fan of \"you gotta experience it to believe it\", but when you visit this sub, there is such an overload of information, that you do not start relating your experiences to the information anymore. In the past, I had already collected large summaries of tips and tricks for social skills from others. However, what always ended up having is me having this huge list of tips that I mostly forgot about when I really needed them and I was never able to really integrate them into my life. I was also not able to make a priority hierarchy in these tips: I just wasnt sure what was the most important/best trick, so I wanted to remember and try them all. This led to a paralysis. \n\nI started journaling for non-social, but mindfullnes reasons: to get my thoughts on paper and out of my head. These thoughts were often about problems I had in my social life. Reflecting intensely on these problems led to solutions in the form of my own thought-of tips in tricks. These \"lessons\" as I call them were tips that I thought of as direct reactions to experiences I had in my life. Journaling made me reflect on my experiences, my social habits and skills in practice (not in theory) and made me engage with them. What started happening is that I started integrating that reflectivity in daily life too. I noticed that when I had a bad experience, for example, instead of getting down about it, I would start dissecting it: why did this happen? how could it be solved? what does it require to start doing that in the future? Multiple repetitive themes started appearing: the fact that I could link these themes to actual experiences, wrote down, engaged and reflected on them made me so much more aware of the conclusions I made on those reflections and stored them in a much more active part of my memory which made it much easier to integrate them into my life than that long list of tips and tricks before. \n\nThe practical way I started: I just decided to write down whatever was on my mind each evening, happening in my life, and if I could take a lesson from that, I underlined it. I just kept this going. I didnt worry too much about recapping: i knew it was all there, I could go back when I wanted to, but the point is: if things come up multiple times, you start remembering them, and if they dont, then they really werent that important anyway.  I furthermore made a promise to myself: when I read back, I will only read the underlined part. Often when I was down and wanted to read back, reading back other depressing paragraphs would get me even more depressed. I knew the underlined parts were pick-me-uppers: solutions. The rest was bullshit. \n\nWondering who else does this and how they integrate this in their lives: always looking for new ideas!",

It's usually good when I message the former 2 and ask them to watch movies/play games, but during chatting they leave the conversations suddenly.\n\nBack in high school, I had 1 friend group kick me because of being \"anti-social and too quiet\", among other stuff such as asking too much questions about them. Started hanging out with other classmates, they also stopped wanting to talk to me after they got close to that old friend group that kicked me. Then I met another friend group that was nice to me at first but then one of the members started taking extremely long to respond to my messages (like we're talking up to 1 month even), and while they do invite me to stuff, it always gets very difficult when I have to invite them (either they say that they have work or that their parents said no, especially that 1 member). \n\nNow I am attending a course associated with IT and recently I invited 1 classmate to go to a bar during the weekend. Well the classmate did say yes, and then at the course we were like friends for 2 days. But today it was like normal acquantainces again. Plus, during group projects I rarely get credits for my work from that classmate (while others do).\n\nAm I the problem here? How do I fix not being able to get closer to anyone?",

Ive always had an explosive character, always in trouble, did manage to graduate froma good uni, changed 20 jobs so far cos i am always bored..And..i dont bond with people. I adored my dad and cared for him in his last days, i cried for weeks when he passed away, and had to cope with alcohol after that, but for the rest of the people..i never really take into consideration anyone else. I have seen therapists but they say i am depressed. I cannot explain to you the amount of boredom i feel. Im always looking for new things, but i get bored of them. I just lie for the fun of it, i dont steal money from people, no need to, but i enjoy so much their reactions and checking how far i can go with each individual. I dont feel guilt about it, its a game to me. Shouldnt i feel something about these things? I feel i needed to tell this cos its hard to explain this to my friends .. Who also bore me. I catch myself telling my self how to act depending on the situation. Ill be out with a friend, he might be talking about his gf and my brain would be like.. just frown your eyebrows and show your disagreement thats what your friend expects. I feel emotions, i cry when i watch videos, but humans.. im just so scared deep inside of them, and dont like them. And this is, all of this is fun and games, but does it make me happy? No. Why am i so weird.",

Recently we had to move to a new highschool because my old one was way too far and ofc I had no friends going into a new school. Since I am quiet and got social anxiety I had a difficult time making any friends but eventually this girl became by friend called Isabel. She seemed sweet at first and we thought we got along but now its not like that whats so ever. In lunch i hang out with her, her bf hunter, and her other friend Mateo. Mateo is cool, he is nice and also doesn’t really say much but Isabel and her bf are a different deal. They are constantly making fun of me to the point where it just makes me upset. I am from Nepal and i got brown skin so they constantly call me “Baljeet” and they make fun of my nose since its a little bigger than the average. They take photos of me without my consent and laugh or send it to their other friend. Ofc i don’t appreciate any of this but I don’t wanna say anything because I don’t have anyone else to go to. I dont have any other friends to hang out with so I have to hang out with them. I hate being alone so much. It just makes me feel like shit and feel horrible about myself.  Hanging out with them just feels horrible and although sometimes it’s really fun (when they ain’t saying shit about me) most of the time it’s really miserable. Idk what to do. As u can tell if i am pretty sensitive and do get sad when they say stuff like that about me cause the way they say it, it’s not in a jokingly way. They said my nose looks like a penis, I am ugly, I smell bad, everything. And ofc i don’t wanna hear that. It’s been so frustrating and idk what to do. Ik after reading this you all might say “get away from them” but thats the thing i can’t. First of all I am too scared to even be like “hey i don’t wanna hang out with you anymore so bye” cause i am pretty weak, skinny and short if i were to get in a fight i would easily lose. Yes i know i am a pussy. I can’t run away like that cause i feel as tho maybe they will see as someone who can’t even take a joke or something. I am just so lost and confused idk what to do. Before i went to this school everything was fine. I had a friend group, who I genuinely loved hanging out with and they didn’t say shit about me. It’s so hard to just make friends and i feel like i just don’t belong here at all. School is so miserable and the thought of going to school is awful now days. Any help would be appreciated.

He also frequently shows up to work stoned, and while I have no issues with weed (I smoke it myself) I don’t think he should be coming to work high, especially when he has the most important job in the room. \n\nMy coworkers also ignore me when I speak or try to join conversations and I often feel ostracized for what seems like no reason from my perspective.

        "text": "If you probably haven't understood from the title, I'm a introvert with next to zero social skills and throughout my life up till a few months ago, I never had a 'friend group'? I had one friend and then she had these friends and so we hung out with  each other. There were never problems with pairings when assignments were given cause it was easy to he divided into groups of 2 or else 4 or the groups were created by an authority figure. \n\nBut now that I have friends, and I have a best friend in this group too but I'm also really good with other people. I think they are cool people and i look up to all of them a lot. It's weird, I know that the actions that I take should be according to myself but I often find myself thinking that what would they say to whatever I'm doing and that's really weird. \n\nAnyways, so the thing is, I'm kinda perplexed on how these things work. Like I like all of them, some more than others, some I can talk really freely to, some I just hang out with because of my best friend. But recently due to an upcoming event it's just really weird. Like we were supposed to do this project together but then suddenly we split into pairs of two. And there's one friend left who's in neither of the pairs... and idk how to work with that? \n\nRecently I've also been gossiping a lot. In the past I used to be on the other side, like, I was the one left out and I was the one gossiped about or something, cause I was never the one leaving people out or gossiping about them so life socks really bad I need help.",

I guess i feel bad because I feel like people would find it as a “red flag” because i can’t keep a relationship for that long or that im not worthy of good friends because of that matter. Am I being unreasonable? Does anyone have any tips on how I can get over this? any feedback will be appreciated",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I'm looking for advice on how to be a more affectionate person.\n\nFor context, I'm a married 33F with two kids. I grew up in a strict Christian family that didn't show affection. We might get the occasional two feet apart side hug with a pat on the back (only from female relatives, never male, and only my immediate family not cousins/aunts). Also, when I was a preteen my mom married an emotionally abusive man who called me and my sister gay if we sat near each other or showed any affection. Yes I'm in therapy.\n\nMy husband is very affectionate and sometimes says I'm icy. After 10 years of marriage I do tell him I love him but I don't initiate physical affection nor do I express my love in any way verbally other than \"love you\". I don't call him honey, babe, etc just his name.\n\nMy in laws are very physically feely people and I feel extremely uncomfortable hugging my father and brother in law's or saying \"I love you\" to them. I'm also not sure if I should be calling my in laws \"mom and dad\" so I just avoid saying their names altogether. For 10 years.\n\nMy group of friends will often hug when they see each other but everyone awkwardly avoids hugging me because they know I go super stiff.\n\nRight now I have no problem being extremely affectionate with my children. I hug, kiss, snuggle, tickle, and express love to them. I'm a little worried that as they grow up I'll lose the ability to do this comfortably, especially since they're both boys and the religion is deeply ingrained in me no matter how much I try to reject it.\n\nDoes anyone have experience becoming more warm and affectionate? Reading this back I think I need more therapy and this might be above Reddit's pay grade.",

        "text": "Across different generations we seem to pass on undocumented behaviors that are incredibly important culturally, this interests me and perhaps it allows me to tie them to problems we are having here.\n\nOne such behavior is engaging in a way that makes someone else feel good, if you were asked, \"what makes a woman feel good?\" or \"what makes a man feel good?\" You would have a difficult time making a list and even more so because everyone is different some approaches could achieve the opposite.\n\nBut even though this seems an impossible feat, there are many observations where I notice people doing just that, and successfully across multiple relationships , if there was such a list it would be changing constantly as you move through life meeting new people and learning new information about them. Even then it would still be hard to write this list down. \n\nSo what I think happens is that this is spread subconsciously. Have you ever just been around a person for a long time and started adopting some of their behaviors? I have.\n\nThen what happens when it doesn't get adopted, for example with people who isolate themselves, there are multiple behaviors that they're missing out on just by not being around.\nYou need practice too, both are very important.\n\nI feel like this generation has a lot of novelty to deal with, you're constantly moving and thinking and calculating and playing and watching and the stream of entertainment, the stream of work, the stream of information never ends.\nThis doesn't leave a lot of time for you to absorb other sources of information or even hang out paying full attention to your friends.\n\nThis leads to older generations being more aware of the emotional needs of another person, some of those old farts are still socially inept but many of them weave into their conversations a degree of charm that validates women they come in contact with without them sounding creepy, and this while saying some of the most inappropriate things.\n\nI don't really want to say it's about the generation someone was born in because it really isn't but we seem to lose a lot of that now because we have more distractions, and it also fits this subreddit where some of us do isolate ourselves and exacerbate the problem, I hope this was in any way helpful.\n\nAlso, don't let anyone tell you you're lazy, if life gives you lemons, it's okay to become sour, but go ahead and make lemonade anyways.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nBefore I begin I'd like to tell you a little about me.\n\nI (20M) did not have a good time socially in high school. I was essentially in a really poisonous friend group that destroyed my self esteem after talking behind my back and shutting me out completely. I had one friend who wasn't toxic but she cut ties with me rightfully after I started being verbally abusive towards her thanks to my stupid ass for having mental health issues and not getting help for them. Since late 2021 I have only had a few friends in my circle and even then I can only see them a few times out of the year since they either live very far away or they have really busy schedules. On top of this my dad died on the day of my HS graduation and my mom can't get any work due to factors I'd like to keep private. So I essentially need to be the main bread winner so that my mom and I can survive. After my friend with benefits left me I started community college, I deleted any and all social media, I got a job at my school, and have been going to therapy for about a year so that, at the very least, I don't act the way I acted towards my friend again.\n\nOk now on to my problem.\n\nEventually I got sick of having little to no friends and felt like I didn't have any support outside of my therapist. So I decided to start socializing again. I've tried almost every method recommended. And so far, I haven't made a single friend. In fact, I just feel more lonely because of my inability to make lasting friendships. I'll break down the following methods below:\n\n**Join a Club!** \\- While my college has clubs, I can't join any that align with my interests since many of them are active during the time I work and I've already had to request my boss to change my schedule to make room for classes.\n\n**Well, Join a Meetup Group For Your Interest/Hobbies!** \\- I had a look at Meetup to see if there were any meet ups that I would join in my area (I live next to a mid-sized city). And I found absolutely nothing. Plus any events I did find were either inactive or the median age was 65+.\n\n**Try Something New!** \\- I actually did do this. I visited a game store near my college and asked if there were any events I could join. The lady who worked there pointed me to a D&amp;D game for beginners. I thought \"You know what? Why not! Maybe it'll be fun and I'll some fun.\" So on the day of said game I went there with the intent of being my best self. I picked my best casual clothes and made myself look as presentable and approachable as possible. When I joined the game the rest of the group both smelled extremely awful and had little interest in talking to me at all. Plus the actual game was the most mind numbing experience I have been through. I got so pissed that I made up an excuse and left.\n\n**Okay, Well How About You Talk to a Classmate at Your College?** \\- I did this a few times and it's never worked. One person asked for my discord info once because I \"Seemed interesting to talk to\" but I haven't heard anything since.\n\n**What About Your Colleagues at Work?** \\- To be extremely charitable. My colleagues do not give enough of a shit to even acknowledge me. I've been working there for about half a year and they still do not even know my name. I even tried to make it easier for them by saying hi every time I come in the office.\n\nSo what now? I'm honestly out of options and theories as to why I can't make even a single friend. And at this point, it's just upsetting to me that I'm always the odd one out in every single scenario I'm put in. Maybe it's something I'm doing wrong? Like, I've been told that I tend to sound bored or disinterested whenever I'm talking to someone. But that's just my natural voice. Do I really have to pitch up my voice to sound fake excited so that the person I'm talking to doesn't think I don't like talking to them? I genuinely am at a loss as to what else I can do. If any of you can give me any advice I'd really appreciate it.\n\nEdit: Changed the wording so that it stays on topic.",

Idk where or if I even saw this but shouldn’t you not try to pick up girls in your class b/c you have nothing in common? Anyway, I consider myself a composed person but man I get flustered around her. We had a project together so I more than likely am more familiar with her than others in the class. With my history and luck, I was convinced, more or less, that I was never going to get close with another girl from my school. But that belief just seems unlikely given it’s been over 2.5 years. It just seems like I’d be missing lots of opportunities. My thoughts are that I should considering how many opportunities I’d miss if I convince myself of that. So I’d really appreciate thoughts.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nDISCLAIMER: I've always been very hygienic. I take two showers every day, during which I make sure to scrub and wash every part of my body. I always brush my teeth twice a day. I make sure to put deodorant after each of my showers. Do my laundry. Constantly washing my hands. I also spent years trying to work on potential solutions with so MANY doctors, the first moment I started to become aware of this issue\n\nFor the past few 5 years, I have suffered from a medical condition that has made my BO so unbearable that people can't stand to be in the same room with me for more than a few moments. I was always a pretty general healthy, sweaty kid, but one day during my senior year of high school, it's like my BO went from smelling like an adolescent's to just completely clouding and covering up a room. I distinctly remember, in my english class, early in the morning, people whispered and discussed asking around what the smell was. At first, I was so shocked and thought it was just something was in the room, but then the same thing happened in my following class. And, it's like from this point onwards my BO only got worse, worse. I didn't really have a close group of friends throughout high school, and really only had people who I would talk to during the school days. But as my BO continued to get worse, worse, people openly didn't want to sit anywhere near me or really sit and talk with me for a prolonged period for time. I adapted by just not really showing up to half my classes my senior year, and hiding in restroom, quiet spaces during the rest of the time. Up to my senior year, I had actually been very good at school and had managed to get an acceptance into a solid university. I thought that with help of a doctor, I would be able to manage this problem, and while my senior year of high school would suck, hopefully I could get my BO issue resolved before I headed off to college. Sadly, I wasn't really able to make any meaningful progress in reducing my BO, and I went off to college in this new state of having an unbearable odor. In college, my social problems only got worse. I didn't push myself to socialize b/c of fear of my odor turning people off, and the negative reactions I'd recieve from people during our interactions, with people covering their mouths and noses, the heavy breathing, the slight look of disgust. I tried attending my classes, but I stopped going to my classes. I was so scared socially that I even feared going into the dining hall, and having people notice my odor and my presence in a tight, compact space. I spent most days in classrooms and libraries where no one else was, and did enough schoolwork to pass my first semester. I don't think I really have had a conversation with someone, outside of my family, for an extended period of time outside of those first days of schools. Eventually, my mental state carried over into my academic career, and by the second term of my sophomore year, I flunked out. During this time, I went back home and I spent time with my family, where there was some anger about me having failed out. I spent most of this time at home, alone and in my room, just browsing the web and discord, rarely leaving my home. At this point, I've resigned to a life of complete, utter isolation b/c my BO is bad that people will actively avoid me if they can. My parents try to support and help me, and they push me to go and just get a job, for 10 hours a week. During this year I spent at home, I'm able to socialize to survive. I can go out and get groceries. Basic things and necessities so we don't die lmao. But everything else seems like the greatest challenge of my life. After this year at home, I enroll in a local university and at the same time I'm able to get blessed with a doctor, who ever since the beginning of the fall has been able to help me slowly reduce my BO. Little by little, my BO has become less and less offensive, and, I do believe that by the end of this spring term, my BO will not be debilitating, just normal. Also, kind of a side note, but my issue originates from a hormonal imbalance, and my body hadn't actually undergone puberty, so during this period, I've grown from 5'10, 190 lbs. to  6'2, 215 lbs, with a few more inches still to go. \n\nAt this current point. I don't go to classes in-person, and can survive just going through notes that are posted online. I don't eat in the dining halls, and will just buy a cheap meal, and then eat back in quiet classroom. The last time I've had a friend who I consistently hang out with is in middle school. I don't really talk to anyone except for a phone call or two every other day with some family. I've already begun to work with a therapist b/c I got a lot of trauma from this shit. It's kind of hard for me to really have a conversation with anyone b/c I feel like at any point they're going to start sniffling or my odor is just going to suddenly reappear in the middle of the conversation. I also worry that people won't interact me or still mock me, even with my odor not being prevalent, b/c I used to smell bad in the past.\n\nBut, I want to get back to a point where I can hopefully get back and strong and create meaningful connections with other people. I want to help people who are suffering so that they don't feel so alone. But to be able to help others, I gotta get right within first. \n\nSo, after the background, I'm looking for ways that I can begin to challenge myself socially and push myself out of my comfort zone. What are some ways that I could just go about challenging myself socially that wouldn't require a big group of friends and would be quite friendly, accommodating to people with difficult pasts in a university setting?",

The ex-mutual was a piece of shit to this new friend which caused me to reach out to them and we've been friends since around the start of the year. The friendship felt like it was built off of trauma bonding at first (which allowed us to become pretty comfortable when talking) but now we've gotten familiar enough with each other that we mainly talk about our love of art. \n\n(Before I go any further in the story I should say that for a very long time, I had crippling social anxiety and very few social skills. Over the past year, however, I've become much more comfortable conversing in everyday situations and expressing myself. Back to the story.)\n\nThings seemed to be going pretty well, we had a good rapport and never really ran out of things to talk about but I slowly realized that as more time passed I would be the only one starting conversations. Them not starting conversations isn't the issue for me since they could be shy, busy, or any number of other things, but it's that I feel like I'm running out of ways to jump right into the conversation. It's always nice to start a conversation by bringing up something we talked about before or an event going on in their life but now we don't really have any more of those. It's been two weeks since we last talked and I'm worried I'm going to screw up the good thing we have going.\n\nI'm almost certain that this is still just my social anxiety talking but is opening a conversation with a simple \"Hey! how have you been doing?\" awkward? It feels absurd to ask since it's such a normal opening line to a conversation, but with all the texting conventions nowadays I feel like if I say something as basic as that it'll give off the impression that I'm boring and that that will make them even less likely to talk to me in the future. I also feel like I can only a line like that so many times before I **actually** do become boring. Like I said I'm sure I'm overthinking all of it to a certain extent, but I think they're super cool and I just want to become better friends.",
