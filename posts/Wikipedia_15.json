        "text": "Back in Summer 2011, I was much younger so one of my hobbies was to sometimes make funny edits that made me laugh, but that didn't amuse others.\n\nOne day, I vandalized an article that looked overdue for an update so I made the page say something like \"Why won't someone update this piece of shit?\" Because I figured that would force attention onto the article, and it did. I was an IP vandal because I felt more comfortable vandalizing as an IP address than a Wikipedia username.\n\nI was also discussing that page on #wikipedia-en on Freenode that day, on some random Freenode username.\n\nAfter I vandalized, I left and came back the next day under a new username.\n\nI asked a different question - wanted to know who the youngest-looking adult celebrities were, and how old they were and looked.\n\nLogan told me to go away because I vandalized yesterday. I feigned confusion and asked, \"I'm sorry but, ahem, {{citation needed.}}\" I was on a Freenode username that I didn't use before.\n\nHe told me every time I enter the channel, my IP address shows up next to my name, then pasted a link to my vandalistic edit from yesterday, then said something like \"So that's how we know you're yesterday's vandal, because you vandalized with that same IP address.\"\n\nAnother user said, \"haha, pwned!\"\n\nI didn't want to admit my age and that I'm so young so that's why, because I thought they'd just give me more crap if I did.\n\nSo instead, I told the Channel something like, \"Turns out, my Wi-Fi is NOT passworded and I live within range of a few apartment complexes and a residence hall of a private college so any one of my neighbors could've logged onto my wi-fi signal and vandalized from there.\"\n\nKilliondude / juancarlos said to that:\n\n&gt; Can't hear, obvicopters too loud.\n\n**Why did he say that? What's an obvicopter?**\n\nThen I told the room something like, \"Perhaps my IP address is a more common kind of IP, kinda like how John Smith is a common name. So if the Police were looking for a wanted criminal named John Smith, would they arrest all 967 other John Smiths in the state just because they all share a name with the wanted man??? 'Cause that's kinda what you're doing!\"\n\nThen Killiondude said \"This guy doesn't know how IPs work!\"\n\nHow do IPs work then?\n\nSo I told the room, \"Sometimes lightning strikes the same place, TWICE. Sometimes a person wins the lottery, TWICE. So isn't it just a HUGE coincidence that someone happened to use my IP address to vandalize some article yesterday?\"\n\nThen Killiondude told me, \"0.5/10.\"\n\nI asked, \"0.5 outta 10 what?\"\n\nHe said, \"Your trolling score.\"\n\nI asked \"Then what's 10/10?\" Killiondude mentioned some celebrity doing something notable but I forgot the details.\n\nSo anyways, once again, why did Killiondude say \"Can't hear, obvicopters too loud\" when I tried to blame vandalizing from my IP address, on the neighbors who borrowed / logged into my unpassworded wi-fi signal?",

I removed the blank space between them, and continued on surfing.\n\nAbout a half an hour later, I received a warning message on my talk page. The editor wrote \"don't make changes without citing reliable sources,\" despite the fact that I only fixed a grammatical error. They went on and undid my edit with them captioning \"changes require verifiable, published citations\" in their comment. \n\nI'm just beyond confused and frustrated on why this person is treating my edit like I vandalized the page with some political rant. Again, all I did was just change some typo. I don't even know how I could even possibly cite sources for such a trivial edit. \n\nOne thing I should note however is that according to the edit history, the person was responsible for crafting much of the page's layout. Perhaps they misinterpreted my edit of their typo as an attack on their work as a whole. ",

The article completely downplays the technical barriers to the point of suggesting they are imaginary, and the only real barriers to transitioning to a 100% renewable system are 'fossil fuels interests' and 'political'.   \n\n\nActual challenges like supply of minerals and energy storage are reduced to paragraphs of a few sentences, whilst sprawling paragraphs are given to very opinionated statements in the history section and the opening blurb.   \n\n\nOverall the article appeals too much to the authority of certain outspoken scientists in the renewables industry, and very little to the climate organisations that matter - the IPCC, IEA etc (none of which suggest 100% renewables is necessary or even possible on a global scale).  \n\n\nIt's fairly obvious this article has seen some gate keeping by vested interests and biased individuals. It's a shame because this is obviously an important topic and I think people are being misinformed by the framing and language that it uses.",
