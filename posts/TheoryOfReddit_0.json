It's counterintuitive, but if we were to make narcissism \"cool\" and show more people adopting the role in public, it might make it safer for narcissists to become conscious of their own self-interest (both natural and excessive), promoting an overall reduction in public narcissistic behavior.

Most of them, of course, completely justified - which is immediately obvious to any user who actually interacts with the \"people\" who do the moderating. But I find it surprising that there is such little awareness about the one, glaring, major problem with content control on this website: *a complete lack of transparency and clarity*.\n\nThe most obvious example of this is the ever-present [removed] tag. Users are almost never notified when their posts are removed, why their posts are removed, or even what the guidelines are to avoid having their posts removed (for instance: karma limits, linking restrictions etc.). Mod logs in general are rarely public (this subreddit being a notable exception), but what makes [removed] so tyrannical, so diabolical, so inimical not so much to free discussion but to *creativity* because it encourages - or, rather, demands - conformity. \n\nI offer no solutions or suggestions because this platform is so fundamentally broken and evil that any fix would be like trying to put duck-tape over a fire-hose.

        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.)\n\nIt is a fact that Reddit is a front in a ‘culture war’ which has either started on or at least found its way to social media. People have always disagreed but the present disputes seem different. I won’t spend time on that.\n\nWhat I will say is that Reddit used to be a fairly single-minded place. Starting out as a new ‘news aggregator’ with a good algorithm and a legible discussion thread, it was filled with young folks who wanted to discuss, and shortly after enjoyed shitposting on the internet. It was Hacker News but more accessible and so it attracted a lot of curious young people. In the same way that 4chan was famously started as a place for kids who understood jokes about d20s and Lord of the Rings (despite what it turned into), Reddit found mass appeal by being a place for being goofy, novelty accounts, power users, retiring perfect jokes (“In Soviet Russia, bomb disarms you”), and just having fun.\n\nAround 2016 the world changed and since then everything has become political. Everything. Why is this relevant?\n\nBefore 2016 circlejerking was a place where self aware people had fun at the expense of people who had no self awareness. A favourite circlejerk post of mine was when Felix Baumgartner reached the outside of the atmosphere. The title of the self post was, “Felix Baumgartner: I see no god up here.” It was a fun joke made at the expense of the golden age of r/atheism. It’s what circlejerking was and why no one was too upset by it. It was a place for parody and satire, and a lot of it was very good. Circlejerkers had different drivers (lovers of satire, people with bruised egos, closet conservatives, people who didn’t think being taught to pray was abusive, etc.) but the unifying concept was a shared sense of humour at the expense of Reddit’s hive mind.\n\nSince 2016 circlejerking has changed. It is now political. Disgusted with the likes of r/the_donald and other places, a lot of circlejerk subreddits have absorbed the over-politicisation of the wider world and become places for demeaning comments that have nothing to do with the thing they are meant to be circlejerking. A go-to example is r/gamingcirclejerking which patently has nothing to do with video games and has been lost inside gamergate since it happened. A close follow up would be r/moviescirclejerk, obsessed with Homelander/The Boys (which isn’t a movie), which would be better served as r/MCUcirclejerk, and which many users believe to be a ‘sister subreddit’ of r/gamingcirclejerk. This ‘sister subreddit’ perception is telling because the only common thread is a culture war-style view of the world; that gamer comicbook fanboys with asinine opinions should be condemned as if they are a serious threat. If following pre-2016 corclejerking traditions, r/gamingcirclejerk would be making fun of Red Dead Redemption 2 tropes, Zelda: Breath of the Wild trick shots, and Death Stranding (just the whole thing). r/moviescirclejerk would be eviscerating A24 and the way in which British actors over the last 10 years have all emerged from the 1%. Instead, it is JK Rowling and Dave Chapelle (who have nothing to do with video games) and Thanos. Neither subreddit consistently focuses on the shitposts of the pages they would be expected to parody. Most crucially, neither of the communities display through their attitudes that they are self-aware. They see themselves as safe spaces with megathreads—they are communities which derive their identities from a wider culture war.\n\nMany circlejerk subreddits have closed, and aren’t allowed to exist. Every attempt to create a subreddit for r/ukpolitics has been shut down by admins (which is very surreal). It’s nearest equivalent (r/badukpolitics) is private and used as a left wing echo chamber to mock right wing takes on the subreddit with np links and a lot of naming and shaming. r/europecirclejerk died many years ago, with r/yurop being a shitpost subreddit that glorifies the vanity of r/europe rather than a parody subreddit which skewers or lampoons r/europe (‘we need to federalise’ etc.). Even something as niche as r/ldscirclejerk (yes it exists) has been closed.\n\nHaving sampled many circlejerk subreddits, the only one that remains true to early circlejerking is r/soccercirclejerk, which even occasionally enforces the community to stop posting stuff from twitter, and reminds people that it is to parody r/soccer and it’s attitudes.\n\nOn the topic of circlebroking, it is not the same and does not fulfil the same social interaction/function.\n\nWith a handful of exceptions (I count only one) ‘Classic’ circlejerking is dead.\n\nI believe this matters. And I believe Reddit is a worse place without circlejerking subreddits.\n\nMany years ago I studied an undergraduate degree and for my dissertation I looked at risky drinking behaviours among young adults (binge drinking). The prevailing conclusion I came to in my research (both literature reviews and novel survey data (stuff I collected)) was that, while not without cost, the phenomenon of binge drinking is a form of calculated and high risk hedonism, and as a result it reduces the frequency of people engaging in socially unacceptable activities when the moment calls for good behaviour. In other words, it is an outlet.\n\nI believe circlejerking was and is an outlet. Reddit is full of asinine, intellectually dishonest, and bad faith arguments. The average Redditor sits squarely in the middle of the bellcurve; stupid, poorly read, and inarticulate (and not on the slopes of above-average intelligence as it would like to believe). It is tiring even lurking subreddits. Idiots often deserve to be called out, and when a hive deserve to be called out, the best place to do it was in a circlejerk subreddit where like minded people, who enjoyed the comedy of the absurdity, could share a few laughs without it being personal.\n\nWithout these subreddits, Reddit is a more boring and a more toxic place. Satire allowed people to enjoy the website while also having an antidote to Reddit’s redditness. By it being a different subreddit, communities could continue none the wiser (or at least it wouldn’t clog up their subreddits). Now, people have limited options of what to do with their frustration. Reddit is more aggressive, it is more cynical, hive minds are more enforced, and (while not necessarily directly related) people spend more time reading post histories to see why they can cancel a person in their mind and disregard all their opinions. Forced to coexist, there is a culture of ‘othering,’ where people will sort Reddit usernames into people that agree with them and people they hate.\n\nClassic circlejerking was an outlet. Without it this website is worse. I don’t know if it was an executive decision to ‘clean up reddit’s image’ or if it was a coincidence.  But around 2016 ‘the culture war’ took a turn and people have struggled to coexist ever since. Maybe that killed circlejerking because people couldn’t bring themselves to do it. Maybe that’s when r/circlejerking shifted to the right then back to the left.\n\nEither way, I believe that circlejerking mattered, and the death of circlejerking mattered probably more. \n\n\\#bringbackcirclejerking",
