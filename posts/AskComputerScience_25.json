        "text": "Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I have a problem I'm looking to solve and figured some of you clever folks might have some suggestions on where to start.\n\nProblem: I'm looking to create a way to store metadata about how an audio file is used and then send that information to a central server. The goal of this telemetry would be to measure user interaction with an audio file (ie. did they skip sections? Fast-forward? Re-listen? etc.)\n\nI understand the easiest way to do this would be to just create my own custom player that gathers the information separately, and then the underlying audio format doesn't matter.\n\nBUT- herein lies the true challenge (which may very well be impossible...). Ideally I want to create a format that effectively rewrites the metadata of the file with the information on how it was played, regardless of what player is used. This would effectively leave a \"footprint\" of user interaction within the file itself. And then find some way to gather this data (either immediately or at a later time). I know, I know this might be a ridiculous idea, but imagine if you could not only see if a user downloaded your audio file, but then could later know how that user consumed that file.\n\nI imagine either repurposing an existing audio format (ie. mp3) to suit this purpose and redefining how metadata is used with that file (which again may be impossible given permission issues), OR instead by using some kind of sidecar file that could act as the storage for the user footprint and get around the permission issues.\n\nI don't know. Feel free to tell me I'm crazy. Maybe there's some crazy creative way to solve this problem out there that I have no clue exists. Thoughts?",

I'm hoping someone here can help clear up my confusion.\n\nI can understand how people could buy and sell blocks of energy just like any other currency.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how someone initially proves they have X amount of energy to sell. You could have a meter at the generator bus measuring analog voltage and current signals, translating them to digital and pushing them out to a block chain to be sold, but how does the block chain verify that these digital signals are legitimate?\n\nWith Bitcoin, the Bitcoins themselves come from within the block chain so to speak. How do we verify that peers in a block chain network really possess what they claim to possess if it's any other quantity?",

But how can this be? My non deterministic automaton branches to take either A or B; how could this be represented with a deterministic automata? Is a non deterministic automaton allowed to store in memory the previous character? Otherwise, how will it know whether it is being fed a continuous stream of random characters versus a string of all the same characters (assume that the alphabet has more than one character)?",

        "text": "So I was just thinking (in the shower of course) about Boolean Logic after I had a few beers. I am currently a CS student btw. I started thinking about the game \"20 questions.\" Surely you've all heard of it, if you haven't it's a game where person A asks 20 questions to guess the answer that person B comes up with. The only answers person B can give are \"yes\" and \"no.\" Then I realized that basically he's answering \"true\" or \"false.\" And then my brain went to 1's and 0's. So I essentially thought that almost any problem can be solved with 1's or 0's. Then I tied that in with logic gates. Is this virtually what Boolean Logic is? That any problem can be solved through a series of 1's and 0's? Sorry, I'm slightly intoxicated and just wanted someone to share my thoughts with, thanks for listening.",

My first semester was great, I received an 'A' on all my classes but everything went downhill from there. Generally speaking, I do really well on math/sciences and all of my computer sciences courses. Since the beginning, I have focused on all math and physics requirements along with all the computer science courses required for my degree. Every \"Core Corriculum/Common Core\" class has been the death of my GPA, reason? motivation. I can NOT for the life of me get motivated to go through ANY course that does not have \"MATH,PHYS, or COSC/CSC\" in its name. \n\nI have Received an 'F' on the following courses:\n\n2 F in HIST \"101\"\n\n2 F in HIST \"201/102\"\n\n1 F in Federal Goverment\n\n2 F in Arts\n\n3 F in Social/behavioral sciences\n\n3 F in Language, Philosophy and culture\n\n\nOn the other hand I have passed everything else relatively easily.\n\nA on Speech\n\nA on both english courses\n\nA and engineering physics 1 and 2\n\nA on calculus 1 and 2\n\nA on Linear algebra\n\nB on Modern physics\n\nA on probability and statistics\n\nA on Discrete math\n\nA on every computer science course up to operation systems(400/4000 level course) including intro to automata which I am currently awaiting the grade and expect an A. \n\nIts quite simple, I absolutely feel no need or want to learn any of the material in the other courses I have failed, and I can not get myself to be invested in them or care enough. I TRY to study for all my courses, but I can not stay focus at all in these other cources. Currently my GPA is 1.9 as a result.\n\nWhat would you guys do in this situation? I am planning to simply drop out, try to build some projects and apply for jobs.\n\n\n\nTLDR : 'A' on classes related to Computer science, mathematics, physics, and english. 13 'F' on everything else. GPA 1.9\n\n\nP.S I know this account is new, I feel too ashamed to post on my main.\n\nExtra info about me: 23M, married and expecting a child. Rent a 2 bedroom apartment, own a car, and work as a desktop technician earning 16/hr, we live quite frugally so we are okay with money, but i wish I could do something I actually would enjoy at work.",

Why does, for example, type checking at compile time forbid me from saying something like (pseudocode):\n\n    var x = 1\n    x = \"foobar\"\n\nFurthermore, as to whether the two definitions are equivalent or not, can I, from definition b), infer that the type checking happens at compile time and not at runtime?\n\nSorry if this seems obvious; I've been stuck on it the whole day.",

And I'm simply going to tally how many times those terms come up in the title of published articles in each issue to give an idea of how many of the articles published this year within those 10 journals are specifically investigating healthcare data security. \n\nWould this be a valid and useful en-devour? I'm literally keeping track of the amount of articles in each issue, tallying the number of times those terms come up in the article titles just using control-f and then storing the results in a table. \n\nAt the end I hope to be able to write a short paragraph stating that of x amount of articles surveyed, y of those articles were security related.

(Again i don't know the technical terms for some of these things, so please look over that and feel free to correct them).\n\nFor example, let's say you visit a porn site. \nWhen you visit that site, it automatically runs a JavaScript that sets a \"download unauthorized application 'tool' \".\n\nThe very first video you watch (that's a clickthrough. You clicked something. You said, yes I'll do this etc...), it downloads a remote rooting (or jailbreaking if IOS) function which allows your device to the be remotely rooted. After your device is remotely rooted the hacker can then install a keyword logging software on your device. \n\nIf you do online banking, or have some cryptocurrency data on your phone. \nThen, Viola! The hackers then can get your bank passwords, or private key for your cryptocurrencies etc...\n\nNow from what I understand, these are not only on porn sites, but other sites as well. Sometimes their intent is malicious, sometimes not(that probably depends on who the end user is, and what their intent with your information is).\n\nNow the question I have is, how do you go about removing this remote rooting function, and keyword logging software off your device?  Will a simple factory data reset COMPLETELY remove them? \nOr CAN they EVEN BE removed after they are on your device? \n\nThanks for the help in advance.",

I'm someone who has done well CS wise up until recently. Basically, I'm an A/A- student when it comes to programming assignments (lowest score I've gotten on an assignment in 3 years was probably an 80 with an average close to a 90). When it comes to written midterms or quizzes, I average about a C/C-. There is a huge gap.\n\nI go to lecture, it was my favorite part of data structures/ Algorithms and Intro class. Missed class twice whole semester due to interviews. I read the material but it doesn't seem to click like programming does. I understand programming as a concept because it's translation and open to interpretation which I do well at, ironically, even though it's still very technical. But when it comes to midterms etc I do very poorly. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I believe I have a learning disorder based on a gap between my Verbal IQ (98% percentile) and Performance IQ (55%). This isn't meant to brag but to highlight the learning disability. It's more  1 more standard deviation from what's considered statistically significant (15 point gap vs my 32 point gap).\n\nI'm basically failing my computer architecture class. Again the same pattern presents itself. Things on the midterm I don't seem to understand. I read the book consistently. I usually start out ahead in the material but other kids catch up and pass me within 2-3 days of reading the same material. It's become pretty discouraging. I am on ADHD medication but I would like some help with I guess linking what happens under the hood (architecture, operating systems, algorithms, etc) with what I am writing in my programs. I also deal with psychosis and visual/auditory hallucinations (I hear voices and am lucid sometimes in and out). I also take medication for this. \n\nI had a feeeling I was lazy and not trying hard enough but I've kind of started to debunk that. I worked about as hard as other students in this class. Going to lecture, reading the book, etc but I'm doing way worse than them. I have started to notice this pattern in other aspects of my life. Things I understand I do very well at. I have a hard time making mental leaps without being babied through it. Even then, thinking critically or applying it in new contexts has always been hard for me. Think a lifetime B student in Math... I get it once it's explained. It's really starting to bother me. Because I know that I'm not lazy now. Something is different about programming. I know how to solve problems and I know how to translate it into code.",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI've been learning C++ the past two years for school and I think I'm ready to start learning another language but I'm not sure what. I've done some very basic scripting before (log onto website, take screenshot, save to shared drive) with JS and thought that was neat. I've done HTMl &amp; CSS before but not really interested in doing any more with that. \n\nAlthough I've enjoyed learning C++, what makes me want to learn another language is that I can't find anything I want to do for fun with C++. To be honest, I'm not sure what I want to do at all, and this is my main hold-up. Let me rattle off some things that might be helpful for you to assist me:\n\n I'm really intrigued by AI/Machine Learning/Neural Network stuff, but I'm also kind of turned away at the idea of using complex math (pretty good at math, just don't enjoy it too much). Scripting is cool too. While I prefer back-end, I do enjoy seeing my code *doing something* whether it be a GUI or a website, but I'm not really good with design stuff. I consider myself to be extremely practical and can't force myself to learn something that I think won't have a use.\n\nHopefully this helps, sorry this post is kind of shitty but I assure you that if I knew what I wanted to do I wouldn't be here.

I haven't explained this well but any guidance on nested dictionaries is appreciated. Thanks.",

I've never done a lot of systematic computer science reading before, but I'm looking to start and could therefore use some ideas about good journals or magazines related to computer science. \n\nI'm not looking for very formal or state of the art texts or articles but rather lighter reads on a broader spectrum. \n\nWhat I'm looking for is something like what *the economist* is for economy students, that is a broad range of articles of high quality texts written in good, correct english. Does it ring a bell for anyone? thanks!",
