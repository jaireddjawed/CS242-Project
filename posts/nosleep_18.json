        "text": "There is a place where I like to go to be alone. A dark forest where the trees are always bare. The ground is always littered with decaying leaves and evergreens stand tall and proud above the rest, providing a dark green contrast to the clear blue sky. A thin layer of frost lies just below the leaves providing a near imperceptible crunch. Snow has not yet fallen but it is coming soon. Winter is just around the corner but somehow a small stream is yet unfrozen. It runs quietly, winding through the trees and under some small decorative bridges. Who knows who made them or why. You can step over the stream at any point but still, they do look nice. There is a gentle wind that blows through this hollow forest. It carry’s a harsh biting wind that cuts through any jacket you could wear. This place is always like this every time I visit. It never changes. There haven’t been any creatures or life in general that I’ve seen or heard. No birds singing nor deer grazing. There is however always a presence. Something watching you no matter where you are and when you think you notice something it darts and slips behind trees and under rocks. No matter how much chase you give you will never find anything. It’s best to ignore it. Chances are there’s a reason it’s hiding. Likely it just wants to watch you enjoy its forest in peace. I think once I found a sign of another person being here. A jacket that was tattered and worn and hanging a few feet up in a tree. There were three tears that looked like claws in the back of the black wool jacket. Just a few feet away there was a rock. Slightly out of place now but it was obvious that it was upturned at some point recently. I didn’t dare flip it. The thought came to me though, and in an instant I felt the eyes burning into the back of my head. So I didn’t flip the rock. Nor did I look around the tree or inside the jacket. I left everything as is. I tried a few animal calls once, into the silence of the forest. I started with some bird calls, crows and things. To my surprise I got some calls back. They felt off though, almost like the calls were just exactly the noise I made but through a grainy speaker. When I moved on to some deer calls I got in return the most guttural, wrenching screech I ever heard. It is still to this day hard to describe. It was a high pitched shriek that attempted to mimic a deer call through human vocal chords but it sounded like it was being played through a broken PA system. It was grainy and echoed far into the distance. It vibrated to the very core of the forest to the point where my vision got shaky and I saw dozens of figures standing just behind each tree, antlers poking out of the sides of their otherwise human heads. All of a sudden the cacophony stopped and I was once again left alone in the forest. The same familiar wind shifting through the empty trees. I was alone again but in the special way that you are alone in this forest. I never called out after that. I never even spoke a word when I was in the forest. I still do go though, it’s too nice not to.",

        "text": "It all started about a week ago, I'd heard about the darkweb and seen a few news articles referring to Hitman, Drugs and all the other nefarious activity you can think of but me being me, I was skeptical, I mean how could the government release a tool for anonymity yet allow all this criminal activity to go on.\n\nSo I decided to download the browser and dive into it my first couple of days into the darkweb were really not that bad I came across the odd gore site and the odd black market but nothing like Hitmen until Wednesday the 4th of February, her birthday, after the party I jumped back on my laptop and jumped into a couple of chat rooms and that's where I found the user smogikas.\n\nAt first he or she never really let anything go until I slipped up and mentioned as a joke I wanted to hire a hitman to kill my girlfriend, as the chat went on and on, I realised what was happening, he/she would charge me 20000, 10000 before and 10000 after. At first I thought he/she was just messing with me until he/she went from being semi friendly to outright angry.\n\nHe/she started threatening me and maybe I shouldn't have poked the bear by taking the Mickey but I thought it was a joke, that's when he/she wrote my name, address and a few other details about me, right there in the private message box, my heart skipped a beat and I started feeling nauseous.\n\nI tried apologizing but he/she wasn't having any of it and he/she bluntly wrote \"You will see the truth with your own eyes shortly, I hope this will be one of your life lessons\"\n\nAnd the chat ended abruptly, I tried playing it off as a joke or an elaborate troll, maybe he was the admin of the site and maybe it was just a joke because I'm a newbie to the darkweb, maybe it was there way of scaring idiots and whatnot away from there.\n\nYesterday is when it happened, I got up and my daily routine just fell into place until about 11:00am when I received a call from the local authorities\n\n\"Hello is this ******\"\n\n\"Yes it is how can I help?\" \n\n\"Your partner has been in an accident, we need you to come to the hospital\"\n\n\"Wha...what happened, wha... What do you mean, what are you talking about, who is this?\"\n\n\"I know this is shocking news but this is PC Steven *********, and I would like you to attend the hospital so we can discuss things further.\"\n\n\"Oooo...ok I'm on the way.\"\n\nI went straight to the hospital and spoke to the officer and he told me that the breakline on her car showed some kind of tampering and right now they are investigating me for it, i don't know what to do if I tell them will I be charged with her murder, if I keep it a secret will it destroy me, what did I do, what do I do now, I'm all alone and it's my fault.",

        "text": " \n\nHi! My name is Vee. I recently lost both my grandparents, Minachi and Perumal, due to Covid-19. I never had a good relationship with my parents and had always been closer to my grandparents. Even though I haven't seen my parents for over a decade, we do talk on the phone and even Whatsapp each other funny memes from time to time. I have always wanted to, but my grandparents always suggested against it.\n\nI would be lying if I said I didn't miss them, but I survived over ten years without seeing them, so I reckoned I would be fine if I didn't see them for another 20 or so.\n\nComing back to the present, after my grandparent's death, I was deeper into depression, and my social anxiety was severe. That's when I decided to adopt a pet cat named Zen. She was the furthest thing from Zen, but having her with me calmed me. Her crazy misused my crazy, I always said.\n\nShe was the 'purfect' pet. Hahahaha, I just had to make that pun. We had the best time together, especially during the second quarantine we Malaysian had. We did everything together. We would eat at the same time, watch a horror movie, and even do our skincare together. \n\nI would always tell her that she has to sleep outside, but she always ends up on my bed and asks for snuggles.\n\nSince this is Nosleep, you can bet things stayed peachy for a short time. One day, I was playing with bubbles with her favorite feather toy. **Let me add a picture of it for context.**\n\nShe hid under my bed and started playing with it. I could only see her paw grabbing the feathers and found it more entertaining than any shows I watched. I heard a scratch at the door and turned to see Zen looking at me wide-eyed.\n\nShe sat there waiting for me but didn't enter. It was still afternoon, so I was still pretty brave; I knelt and looked under the bed to see a pair of red eyes looking back at me. I could see a grin and sharp white teeth, but I couldn't make up the face.\n\nI always wondered what I would do in situations like this. Would I faint? Or would I wake up and realize it's just another dream? Or would I scream for help? I, instead, calmly stood up, took my handbag, and carried Zen into my car. \n\nI drove straight to a nearby temple and informed a Hindu Priest of this incident. He looked at one of his assistants and me.\n\n\" We can come over and take a look. Did you purify your house before moving in?\" The assistant, who introduced himself as Pandi earlier, spoke. \n\n\" With turmeric and everything, I even had another Hindu Priest do the ritual for me,\" I answered. \" This was about three years ago, a day after I moved in.\"\n\n\" Okay, we can't come immediately since we have prayers to attend to, but I can come tomorrow at 10 am. Do stay somewhere else for tonight.\" He said, and I obliged. \n\nI booked a hotel room for the night. Usually, in situations like this, I confide in my grandparents or best friend. My best friend, Sam, was already worried about her family member suffering from Covid, and I did not want to add to her worries.\n\nI tried calling my parents instead, and they didn't pick up. I texted them, no reply as well. I decided to sleep with Zen lying at my feet, and I felt safer just being around her. \n\nI woke up to Zen licking my hand.\n\n\" Do you need food?\" I asked. She kept licking. I got up and turned the light on to check her food and water. She has enough. I stroked her a few times and asked her what was wrong; she just looked at me wide-eyed. \n\nI rechecked my phone, no reply from either of my parents. I found this odd as they usually reply almost immediately.\n\nI started patting Zen again. It was dark, but I could feel it beside me, purring. I turned to face her and got shocked. \n\nI was back in my house. I got up, turned the lights on, and saw my room rather than the motel room. Zen was also next to me. I got out of my bed and looked around. I wasn't sure if I was dreaming, but it felt real. \n\nSuddenly, moldy fruits fell from the ceiling to my bed. The first thing I thought was, *What the fuck?* That startled me for a second, but I didn't want to wait to figure things out. I ran out of my apartment to the lobby and borrowed the security guard's phone to call my best friend to pick me up. \n\nI waited in the lobby with Zen for her to pick me up. Sam came to pick me up within 15 minutes, and we drove to my hotel room. I explained what had happened, and she was thankful, not accusing me of hallucinating or being crazy. I am so grateful for her. I also told her that I had contacted my parents but had yet to receive an update from them. \n\nShe assured me that they were probably just busy. I asked her to stay over, and she obliged. \n\n\"I forgot to tell you, and I also had moldy fruit fall from nowhere to on top of my bed back at my place. \" I added as we were getting ready for bed.\n\n\"Huh, fruits?\" She asked. \" Was the hole or something on your ceiling?\"\n\n\"No, it just fell on the bed from nowhere.\"\n\nShe thought for a while. \n\n\"What's your house number?\" She asked.\n\n\"4; why?\" I answered. \" Don't you dare suggest something is wrong with the house? I have been staying there alone for three years.\"\n\n\"Yeah. The number 4 is associated with death, but you have lived there too long without disturbance.\" Sam said. Zen jumped on her and started licking her hand. \"She is so cute; I wish my mom would let me get a cutie like her. \"\n\n\"Hahaha, yea, she is adorable. I honestly think I am this brave cause of her.\" I said. \n\n\" How long have you had her again?\" She asked. \n\n\" For a week now. \" I answered, starting to pat Zen. \n\n\"Hmm, could it be that she brought some weird ghost with her?\" Sam suggested.\n\nI thought about it for a moment, but that still didn't make sense. Sam also insisted that moldy fruit from my ceiling didn't make sense, either. That night I slept thinking about what Sam said.n I could see Zen sleeping at the end of the bed and Sam beside me. Having them both made me feel safer, and I didn't have much disturbance for the entire night.\n\nThe following day, I woke up early, and Sam and I drove to my apartment to see the Indian priest and his assistant waiting for us. Thirucelvam and Surya introduced themselves, respectively. We exchanged some pleasantries as they both asked me for basic information about how long I had been staying they and other information so they could proceed with their check.\n\nThirucelvam walked in and calmly looked around. He walked straight to my room and asked my permission to look around, and I allowed it. He walked in and scrunched his nose as if he smelled something terrible. He instructed his assistant to sprinkle some turmeric water all over the house. \n\nThe water hid the floor and started sizzling as if the floor was hot. Sam looked at me, terrified. \n\n\"What's that?\" Sam asked.\n\n\"This usually happens if there is an ill intention towards you, and I haven't seen anything like that for years. \" The assistant explains. He guided us out of the room as the priest was still inside the room, and he looked around as if he was looking for something.\n\n\"Do you have anyone who doesn't like you?\" He asked me. \n\nI took a second to think and told him yes, who doesn't?\n\nHe asked if I had someone who might hate me so much that they would go to difficult lengths to send malicious entities toward me.\n\nSam and I looked at each other, and I said no. Thrirucelvam exited the room with an odd flower arrangement with him. \n\nHe explained that he found this under my floor, and I am still determining where or what that even is. \n\nHe explained further that someone had placed this here to wish harm on me. To weaken my physical energy and invite malicious spirits to me.\n\nI couldn't think of anyone—the thought of someone being in my apartment without knowing started me. I don't think I could feel the same in my place.\n\nThe priest continued that he would cleanse my energy and that the best thing was to move house. I immediately looked for Airbnb to stay at and found a few good options. \n\nI decided to stay at the hotel till then. The hotel had multiple CCTV and security that assured me that no one could get into my room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will try to add more accounts to this story. It is not done yet, but there are a lot of things that I am still investigating.",

        "text": "We were becoming closer, the house and I. As time passed, and Aaron grew busy at work, it was I who tended its many wounds: cleaning its gutters and touching up the chipped paint above the backsplash. Updating the outdated hardware on its cabinets. \n\nAnd though I still feared it, I found myself beginning to love it a bit too, as each small change connected us.\n\nNow that we had decided not to sell it, the house seemed to trust me more. It no longer devoured the chairs while I sat in them. And around bedtime, it even grew quieter, holding off on its most serious eating until I’d fallen asleep.\n\n“It’s old,” I told Aaron one day at dinner. “It hasn’t been loved in a long time. Only used. Even we have been so focused on what it can do for us, that we never stopped to ask what we can do for it.” \n\nI pointed to a section of floorboards long stained from some ancient leak, and then gestured to the single-pane windows, that bled heat all winter.\n\n“It’s just a house,” said Aaron. “But sure. If you want to do a couple of renovations, go nuts. FYI, though, it’s going to be all on you: I’m about to get even busier. Remember how I told you Ken Lewis got pneumonia? Well, turns out he didn’t make it.”\n\n“I’m so sorry,” I said. “I know he was a mentor.”\n\nAaron shrugged. I had always admired his ability to persevere through pain. His mother had died only a few months into our time dating, and he’d soldiered on with a smile, flying through law school and acing the bar, never once betraying any indication that her death had affected him. \n\nNow though, I considered the dark side to his ability to turn off his feelings. The house’s previous owner, Pamela, had suggested my husband was someone to be feared. But what that meant, I didn’t yet know.\n\n“Ken was practical. And ruthless,” said Aaron, finishing a chicken wing and casually tossing the bones on the floor for the house to eat. “He made partner at thirty-two. He wouldn’t want me to mourn. He’d want me gunning for his spot.”\n\nI bristled a little at the word *gunning* but tried to maintain my smile.\n\n“What can I do to support you? Maybe we should have dinner with some of the other partners… we could call it a belated housewarming. An old-fashioned charm offensive.”\n\n“Peter Green is the only one that matters,” he said. “He’ll be playing kingmaker. But we should invite the rest of my competition. Let me outshine them here on our homecourt. The only other real contender is Marlon Vasquez, but he’ll flame out if we give him the opportunity. We’ll make sure all of his favorite are scotches readily available.”\n\n“You’re going to win this thing,” I told him. \n\n“I knew there was a reason I loved you,” he said. \n\nA few weeks later, several of Aaron’s coworkers from the firm arrived for the dinner party. Even though he was competition, I liked Marlon. He and his partner Bill arrived with a chocolate creme cake from a Michelin-starred bakery. As with every other time we’d met, they were effusive about my outfit and figure, but what touched me the most was their love for the house.\n\nBill was a student of the Edwardian period, and paraded through the house like a kid in a candy store, drooling over the whalebone inlay around the fireplace, the carefully carved oak bannister, the original hardwood. \n\nThe house seemed to take these compliments with pride. I’d never felt its mood so light. Like a child on its best behavior, it even spared my most delicate appetizers. We poured wine and champagne and paid a caterer to supply a lavish 4-course meal. Aaron was beaming. \n\nAnd then right at six we got the news that Peter Green had taken ill and wouldn’t be able to attend. \n\nAfter that, Aaron’s mood turned sour. It was him, not Marlon, drinking one too many scotches. By dessert, he was talking a bit too loud, slurring slightly, shifting from happy to angry all in the same sentence.\n\n“May the best man win,” he said at one point, raising his glass up to Marlon such that it bumped into him and sloshed all over the floor.\n\n“My fault,” said Marlon, trying to be gracious. “Let me go grab a towel and I’ll–”\n\n“The house will take care of it,” said Aaron. “Trust me. Don’t waste your time.” He poured a fresh glass for himself and then flung it on the floor too. “Go on,” he spoke to the ceiling. “Drink up, won’t you?”\n\n“I think we’d better get going before our Tesla turns into a pumpkin,” said Bill.\n\n“Always wondered which of you was Cinderella,” said Aaron. He was staring strangely at Marlon in a way I’d only seen once before: the night he stood over the man in white’s body. I remembered the sound of the two gunshots. One through the head, the other through the heart. How had he learned to fire so precisely?\n\nI tried to take Aaron’s hand as I whispered, “Honey. This isn’t you.”\n\nHe snatched his hand away.\n\n“When did you become such an expert on who I am?”\n\n“I think we’ve both had a bit too much to drink,” said Marlon, grabbing his coat. “I’ll see you at the office.”\n\nThe other guests made their excuses and filed out after him. As the last one left, Aaron looked down at the puddle of scotch on the floor.\n\n“Drink!” he shouted. “Why won’t you drink?”\n\n“It’s not a trained puppy,” I said. “You can’t just bark out orders.”\n\n“It’s a tool,” he said. “It’ll do its job.”\n\nFinally, after a few seconds, the scotch began to disappear.\n\n“That’s a good boy,” said Aaron, his pronunciation lazy. “That’s a good boy.”\n\nThe party had been a setback for Aaron’s career aspirations, how big we didn’t know. Either way, Aaron threw himself into work, pulling late nights at the office as he tried to prove his worth.\n\nIn the meantime, I found myself alone more often than ever before. Once the kids left for school in the morning, it was just me and the house for hours on end. With little to clean, I spent my time on what additional repairs I could, updating the lightbulbs to LEDs and even recaulking the bathtub.\n\nOften when I was done, the house’s grinding turned into something almost like a purr, as if I’d removed the thorn from the paw of a great lion.\n\nFinally, though, I reached the limit of what I could fix myself and called in an expert. Brian Logan was a carpenter and a jack of all trades. He was also a friend since grade school who I could trust to be discreet.\n\n“Sure, I’ll fix up your haunted house,” he said with an easy smile as he walked down the stairs. “As long as the money’s real.”\n\nI rolled my eyes.\n\n“Come on. You know I’ve never believed in any of this stuff before. This. This is real.”\n\n“It really made your kids forget their dog?” he said. “I gotta be honest, I don’t ever remember you having one either.”\n\n“See. And I know you met King when I had him out on a walk once! I’m telling you.”\n\nHe shook his head and laughed. “New windows, sanding and restaining on the hardwood throughout. You’d better hope your husband makes partner, ‘cuase this is gonna cost him.”\n\nI can admit it now: I loved watching Brian fix the house. Watching him run a sander across the house’s floor felt almost like a massage. When he pried the windows from their casings, it was like some rotten tooth had been pulled out. There was almost a kind of physical relief to it.\n\nBest of all, I could tell he worked with love. He spoke to the house like I did, assuring it that all the changes would be for the best, that even if a saw hurt like hell as he cut out a rotted board, it would all be for the best.\n\nAnd then there was Aaron. He’d come home late, sometimes reeking of booze from nights out drinking with the boss or some important client. Usually, he wouldn’t even shower, counting on the house to eat him clean. Once, dead drunk, he threw up right in bed and slept in it.\n\n“It’ll all be gone in the morning,” he said. “Like it never happened. You won’t even need to wash the sheets.”\n\nThen one day, Aaron came home early and found Brian still working, finishing up the installation of a new double-paned window.\n\n“Brian, right? Claire’s friend from high school.”\n\n“That’s me, boss. You must be Aaron.”\n\n“She didn’t mention how good-looking you were, Brian,” said Aaron, slurring slightly. It was one in the afternoon.\n\n“You look like you could use some rest,” I said. “Brian, we can call it a day.”\n\n“Nah,” said Aaron. “I wanna see what I’m paying for. Maybe Bry-guy can walk me through all of these little touches of yours.”\n\n“We need a few supplies,” offered Brian. “Maybe Claire can hit up Lowe’s while I give you the tour.”\n\nA few minutes later, I was walking through the window aisle when I bumped into Bill, who was pushing a shopping cart full of flower pots and potting soil. \n\n“Claire!’ he yelled, giving me a big hug. “How’s it going? Here escaping your husband for a few minutes, I take it?”\n\n“I’m really sorry about the party,” I said. “What Aaron said to you and Marlon was totally out of line.”\n\nA strange look crossed Bill’s face. “Who’s Marlon?” he asked. \n\nI sprinted back to the car, calling Brian’s phone over and over again, only to get no response. I tried Aaron too. Nothing. Even before I pulled into the driveway, I knew it was too late.\n\nI found Aaron on the basement stairs, sipping from an open bottle of wine as he watched dry skin flake from a nearly bare skeleton. His gun sat at his feet.\n\n“It doesn’t like me,” he said, gesturing to the house. “It doesn’t like to do what I tell it to do. But it sure loves to eat.”\n\n“Aaron,” I said, shaking with fear. “Why did you… Brian was…”\n\n“Brian who?” asked Aaron smiling. “Was there a guy here, Claire? I guy looking at you with sweet little puppy dog eyes, fixing up your precious house? What else do you think he was planning to do with you? Are you sure you aren’t just making him up? Go ask anyone on the street if they’ve ever heard of the guy. I’m sure they’ll tell you he doesn’t exist.”\n\n“And Marlon?” I asked.\n\n“He was in the way. You should have heard the vicious rumors he was starting about me. How I’d made some kind of slur against him at the party. Well, now that never happened. *Because there is no Marlon.”*\n\n“But there was,” I said, tears rolling down my face. “There was.”\n\nAaron shook his head.\n\n“You need to work on forgetting,” he said. “Remembering around here is dangerous.” Slowly, he picked up the gun and pointed it at me. “Come downstairs,” he said.\n\nI thought about running. Then I thought about the two shots I’d heard. One through the head, one through the heart. I didn’t have a chance.\n\nI did as I was told, the stairs creaking under my weight as I descended. By the time I reached the basement floor, Brian’s bones had turned to dust.\n\n“Stand in the hot spot,” said Aaron quietly.\n\n“Please,” I said. “Don’t do this. Think of Derek. Grace.”\n\n“I wonder what they’ll remember,” he said, looking thoughtful. “Will they think they were abandoned at birth? Or will there just be a big, gray blank spot in their memories, the place you used to occupy. I guess we’ll have to wait and find out.”\n\nI was so scared I couldn’t control my legs. I fell to the floor, sobbing,thinking of my children, of being erased from their memories. Every goodnight kiss and book I’d read, every hug, every lunch I’d packed. It would all be gone.\n\n“You’ll remember,” I said. “*You’ll* remember.”\n\n“You have no idea how good I am at forgetting,” he said, cocking the trigger.\n\nAnd that’s when the ceiling above him collapsed, the perfectly good beam cracking right in half and landing squarely on top of him as the house sacrificed its body to save mine. Brian screamed, but the house only purred. It was ready for its next meal.\n\nSometimes, I like to pretend that he died right then. Of course, that’s not the truth. \n\nAaron was very much still alive, just trapped, screaming at me to get him out. But I didn’t listen. I had found his gun at my feet. I’d never fired one before, and it felt unexpectedly heavy as I picked it up. \n\n“Don’t,” he said as I leveled it at him. “I wasn’t really going to shoot you, I swear. I just needed to scare you. To make sure you wouldn’t turn on me.”\n\nAnd I realized I had spent a lifetime listening to Aaron talk. He was always talking. Lawyers are just so good at it. So convincing. With enough time, enough words, I’m sure he would have talked me around.\n\nBut instead I shot him in the head. \n\nFor a minute, I just stood watching him. \n\nAaron’s skin began to harden and clutch to the bone. And then finally, after maybe half an hour, he was all gone, a pile of powder under the ruined basement ceiling.\n\n“Thank you,” I whispered to the house.\n\nI’m a single mom now. Most people think I always have been. In some ways that makes it easier. I mourned Aaron in my own private way, but at least I didn’t have to worry about the kids’ grief.\n\nWe’re happy in the house now. The mood has been light ever since Aaron’s departure. The house munches happily on groceries. I don’t think it ever *wanted* to eat bodies. Not really. It just ate what we gave it. And now I try to give it love.\n\nStill, every once in a while, I wonder if I might need to use it again. \n\nA few days ago, Derek came home from school with a bloody lip and told me about a much older boy who’d been bullying him. That night, I couldn’t help indulge a little fantasy about dragging that boy’s body to my basement and putting him right in that hot spot.\n\nOf course, it was only a fantasy. For now at least. I mean, I never thought I’d be capable of killing anyone before I shot Aaron.\n\nSometimes, when my thoughts get dark like that, I think about how hard it is to know people. Even yourself. There’s this old quote from Hamlet that I’ve been turning over in my head lately. It says, “We know who we are, but know not what we may be.” So true, so true. \n\nSee, I used to think the house wanted us because of Aaron, but in the moment where push came to shove, it chose me. \n\nAnd sometimes, as I lay awake at night, peacefully listening to it feed, I wonder if I was the one it wanted all along.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there was a peculiar plant with leaves that resembled a Venus flytrap, but it was much larger and more menacing. The plant's size was massive, with its leaves being as big as a human's body, and it had a deep, dark red color that made it look even more frightening. The locals called it \"the Devil's Snare.\"\n\nThe Devil's Snare was unlike any other plant in the forest. It was a carnivorous plant that lured its prey with a sweet aroma that emanated from its leaves. Once an animal got close enough, the plant would snap its leaves shut, trapping its victim and slowly digesting it over the course of several days.\n\nThe people of the nearby village knew about the plant's deadly nature and avoided the area where it grew. However, one day, a group of researchers came to the forest to study the flora and fauna. They were a group of botanists and biologists, and they were interested in the Devil's Snare. They wanted to study its unique traits and understand how it was able to survive in such a dense forest.\n\nThe researchers were a team of five people, and they set up their camp at the edge of the forest. They had all the necessary equipment to conduct their research, including cameras, microscopes, and measuring tools. They also had a large tent where they could rest and eat.\n\nOn the first day of their research, the team decided to explore the forest and look for the Devil's Snare. They had read about the plant in a few books, but they had never seen it before. As they walked deeper into the forest, they noticed that the trees were getting taller and thicker, and the sunlight was slowly disappearing.\n\nAfter walking for several hours, the team finally saw a clearing up ahead. They approached it cautiously, and when they reached the edge of the clearing, they saw the Devil's Snare in all its glory.\n\nThe plant was enormous, and its leaves were wide open, waiting for its next prey. The team was amazed by its size and beauty, but they were also a little afraid. They knew about the plant's carnivorous nature, and they didn't want to get too close.\n\nAs they started taking pictures and measurements, one of the team members noticed that there were some bones lying around the base of the plant. At first, they thought it was just some animal remains that the plant had consumed, but then they realized that there were human bones as well.\n\nThe team was horrified. They had stumbled upon a graveyard, where the Devil's Snare had consumed several people over the years. They decided to leave the area immediately and go back to their camp.\n\nThat night, the team couldn't sleep. They were too afraid of what they had seen. They knew that the Devil's Snare was dangerous, and they didn't want to get too close. However, they were also curious about the plant and wanted to understand how it was able to survive in such a dense forest.\n\nThe next day, the team decided to go back to the clearing and study the plant more closely. They set up their cameras and microscopes and started taking samples of the plant's leaves and stem.\n\nAs they were working, one of the team members heard a strange noise. It sounded like a rustling in the bushes. They all looked around, but they didn't see anything. They assumed it was just an animal and went back to their work.\n\nHowever, as they continued working, the noise got louder and closer. Suddenly, the Devil's Snare's leaves started to close in on them. The team members tried to run, but the plant's leaves were too fast. One by one, the team members were trapped in the Devil's Snare's deadly embrace, and their screams filled the air as they were slowly digested by the plant.\n\nDays went by, and the team never returned to their camp. The village where they had come from grew worried, and a search party was organized to find them. When the search party arrived at the edge of the forest, they found the researchers' abandoned campsite and evidence of their work. The search party assumed that the team had gotten lost in the forest and had died of exposure, so they started looking for their bodies.\n\nAfter hours of searching, the search party found the clearing where the Devil's Snare grew. They were horrified to find the remains of the team members lying around the base of the plant. It was clear that the Devil's Snare had consumed them.\n\nThe search party was terrified and knew that they needed to warn the rest of the village about the dangerous plant. They went back to the village and told everyone about what had happened in the forest.\n\nThe village decided to hire a group of hunters to go into the forest and destroy the Devil's Snare. The hunters were experienced and knew how to deal with dangerous animals, but they had never encountered a carnivorous plant before.\n\nWhen the hunters reached the clearing where the Devil's Snare grew, they were shocked by its size and strength. They tried shooting at the plant with their rifles, but the bullets bounced off its leaves. They tried chopping at the stem with axes, but the plant was too thick and resilient.\n\nAs the hunters were fighting the plant, they heard a strange noise coming from the forest. It was a group of people chanting, and they were getting closer. The hunters were confused but didn't let their guard down.\n\nSuddenly, a group of men and women emerged from the forest. They were dressed in strange clothes and had their faces painted with intricate designs. The hunters recognized them as the local tribe that lived deep in the forest. The tribe was known for their worship of plants and animals and had been living in the forest for generations.\n\nThe tribe approached the hunters and started speaking to them in their native language. The hunters didn't understand what they were saying, but they could sense that the tribe was trying to communicate something important.\n\nOne of the tribe members stepped forward and pointed at the Devil's Snare. He spoke in broken English and said, \"Devil's Snare is sacred. You cannot kill it. It protects the forest from outsiders.\"\n\nThe hunters were confused but realized that the tribe saw the plant as a protector of their land. They tried explaining to the tribe that the plant was dangerous and had already killed several people, but the tribe didn't listen.\n\nThe hunters knew that they couldn't convince the tribe to let them destroy the plant, so they decided to leave. As they were walking away, one of the hunters looked back at the Devil's Snare and saw something that sent shivers down his spine.\n\nThe plant's leaves were opening, revealing a group of bones inside. The bones looked human, and the hunter realized that the plant had already consumed several people before the researchers had even arrived.\n\nThe hunters left the forest and returned to the village, where they warned everyone about the Devil's Snare. The village decided to stay away from the forest and never venture near the plant again.\n\nYears went by, and the Devil's Snare remained in the clearing, growing stronger and more dangerous with each passing day. The tribe continued to worship the plant, believing that it was a symbol of their land's power and protection.",

        "text": "I came back to my hometown after my wife and I separated 7 months ago. I loved her, I cherished her. I was so happy just being with her. But she said she was miserable.That we just weren't compatible. After countless, bitter fights, she left me. I didn't know where I went wrong. I begged her to give us another chance. But she never came back to me. I was sad, hurt. But soon all that turned into anger. I did so much for her, gave up so many things, but she never appreciated it, never cared for me. So I came back here in the hope that my happy childhood memories and old friends would distract me from everything else, maybe even heal me.\n\nBut then the killings started. In the town where my wife lived. Four murders in two weeks, all women, between 35 -40 years of age, with 14 cuts on each body, eyelashes plucked out, toenails pulled out and arranged over the head like some gruesome halo. But there was no sign of sexual violence. There seemed to be no connection among these women other than the fact that they were either divorced or separated. \n\nMy wife called me on the day the fourth body was found. It was one of her co-workers who was recently divorced. She was terrified. She begged me to go and stay with her. So she was safe from the serial killer. I hated my wife for leaving me like that. But she was still my wife. So I drove all the way to her town and stayed with her that night. She was so relieved to see me.And I felt a bit happy seeing her like that. We hugged and I told her I was there for her .Then I  tried to kiss her. But she shoved me away saying she only wanted me here so everyone thought we were still together. And that I shouldn't expect anything more. I realised she would never ever care for me. I would never get another chance with her. I couldn't stay. I just couldn't. I told her I couldn't stay with her but made her double check that all doors and windows were locked. I made sure the alarm was working and there was nothing unusual going on. \n\nWhen I left sometime later, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Like I had forgotten to check something. But I couldn't just go back, so I kept driving. \nI was exhausted but I called my mother in law and asked her if she could check in with my wife the next day. Though she wasn't on good terms with either of us, she agreed to give her a call. I went to bed and fell asleep instantly.\n\nI slept in the next morning. I didn't wake up until I heard the doorbell ring. I checked my phone but it had died sometime in the night. So I got up and went to the door. It was the police. I knew immediately what they were going to say. I knew I shouldn't have left in such a hurry last night. I knew something was wrong. \n\nIt was my wife. They found her body this morning. Her mother was worried when she didn't answer her calls and called the cops. It was the same. 14 cuts, no eyelashes, toenail halo. I was heartbroken. I still loved her.\n\nThe police wanted to know the purpose of my last visit to her. They probably saw me enter and exit through her porch camera. I told them as much as I could. According to the medical reports she died around the time of my departure from her home. Maybe the killer was in the house when I left. So they asked me if I had seen something unusual. I told them something didn't feel right but I still couldn't place it. So they asked me to contact them if I remembered anything else. I wasn't really a suspect as they had probably looked into my alibis for the time of the previous murders. \n\nAnyway, 2 days and 1 more murder later, the police finally caught the killer. A psycho who didn't take rejection too well. The case was closed. Everyone was happy and relieved. \n\nI was watching a report on the murders that night when I realised what I had missed that day.\n\nThe two toenails in the middle of the halo should have been facing each other like in all the other cases. Either no one noticed it or they thought it was nothing unusual.\n\nI really hope it's the latter.",

        "text": "Okay, let me explain. So I'm a college student, I'm not going to say my college here as it's pretty small and that would basically dox me. \n\nI woke up in the middle of the night, really needing to piss. I turned on my light to try and find my shoes because well, dirty college bathroom floor, but nothing happened when I flicked the switch besides a small spark. That sucked. Another thing for maintenance to fix, because my heater has been broken literally all semester.\n\nIt was only when I opened my door and found that *all* the lights were off. Here I assumed that the power got switched off. Wouldn't shock me, since this college is kinda shit.\n\nI heard a voice in my room ask, \"What are you doing?\" \n\nIn all my infinite wisdom, I slammed the door and hissed, \"What the hell are *you* doing?!\" Inflammatory? Maybe. But in my defense, I didn't know who the hell this was. My roommate left a while back, and this didn't sound like her.\n\nShe told me to sit down, go back to bed. I didn't really follow her instructions at first, instead opting to look around and try to find her. I couldn't see her anywhere, though.\n\nShe introduced herself as Lucy Furanage, and said her pronouns were she/they. I gave her my own name and pronouns, and finally sat my ass down. She told me that the world was ending eventually, that everyone was going to be dying soon. She said I'd be the last person alive, so I better cherish the fact that she's giving me life.\n\nHonestly, she sounded extremely convincing. Convincing enough for me to start believing her. The thought of the world ending scared the shit out of me. I thought that was gonna be the last time I could do anything, really. All my hobbies, friends, family... They were all gone, and all that was left was Lucy. It made me want to cry and scream, you know? Grief and fear don't mix well.\n\nI still couldn't see her, but I felt her put something in my hand. \n\nAnd then the lights flickered back on, and she was gone. First I looked down at the item I had been given. It was a weird photograph of a woman in her early 20's or so. On the back, \"REMEMBER ME, PLEASE - LUCY F.\" was written.\n\nI then looked EVERYWHERE for her. She was just... Straight-up gone. I went and pissed, and then went around and asked some of the other girls in my hall about it. Apparently, they saw and heard nothing during the power outage and didn't recognize the girl in the photo.\n\nI'm going to go ask some of my professors about it in the morning, then maybe administration. I'm scared shitless and I can't stop thinking, but I'll be brave about it. If the world is really ending, how long do I have? Why was I chosen as the only person with this knowledge? When will it happen? She never even told me!\n\nI don't know what else to do, honestly. Nobody knows anything about this, but I know it happened. The only piece of proof I have is the damn photograph.",

        "text": "June 13th  \n\n\nA loud piercing scream cuts through the quiet night sky. Its crying weeping shrills. It’s probably another person being torn apart by the wild dogs again. We always tell them to not go past the borders at night, but they never listen. They usually don’t come back, but the ones that do aren’t the same. Chris. Chris was a pretty cool and funny guy before he left, always bringing the mood up when it was sour. He went out one time. \n\nOne time. \n\nHe came back with his clothes in tatters, cuts, and bruises all over his body. One of his eyes was gouged out, leaving a deep pit of emptiness in the socket. \n\nAfter he recovered from his injuries he wasn’t the same, I noticed he never had his back to a large group of people, and he constantly looked over his shoulder as if searching for something stalking him. His eyes, well, his eye always had bags under them. He must’ve constantly been awake out there trying to survive and he never got rid of the feeling. His pupil has always been a large dark circle of nothingness. \n\nI’ve also noticed he tends to stay away from light, he keeps away from campfires and his room lights are always off. I’m not sure what's up with that, I’d imagine after being in the dark for several hours straight you’d want to stay in the light as much as possible. Speaking of the night, I should explain how the day-night cycle works here.\n\nSo what I’ve been told is that the day lasts 18 hours in the summertime and 12 hours during the winter. The night lasts 24 hours in the summertime and 30 hours during the winter. There are always 42 hours in a typical day of ours. I heard that there used to be 24 hours in a day before ‘The Falling’, but it just doesn’t sound believable. \n\nMy grandparents used to tell me many stories about the world before It all went to hell. Like school, it’s this place where a whole bunch of kids goes learn about math and science. We sort of have that now, but now it’s just about learning how to survive out there. We learn about the types of known creatures out there, the plants, and diseases. Everyone is immune to most diseases out there, or they would get mildly sick before healing right up. Though there's always something new to find out there.\n\nMy grandparents were pretty cool. \n\nMy granddad was a Delta Force operator, he was mainly a part of the assassination group, but also participated in regular operations too. He was an adventurer and researcher after The Falling. He went out during the day to go out there and find out about new things. Like new animals or plants, he also researches animals, cures for diseases, and how to get the old planet back. Oh and a planet is just a really big rock in space, I don’t really understand what space is though. A lot of nothingness just doesn’t make sense, where did it come from, know?\n\nMy grandmother was a teacher, she’s the one that told me all about the Solar System and what planets were. She also taught me how to read which is pretty cool. But not like the other people, she taught me all about syllables, vowels, and really big words. She’s the only probably the only reason I’m still alive, reading is very useful. \n\nTheir kids, my mother, and father, died early in my life. They both were adventurers and were killed outside the walls. That’s all they told me, they never found the bodies. My grandmother told me that they were lost in a cave somewhere, and by the time they made it out of the cave it was dark. They weren’t as lucky as Chris. \n\nDespite the horrors that lie outside the gates, I still want to explore this barren world. My grandparents never tried to stop me, but they prepared me the best that they could. My grandmother gave me all her knowledge on the outside and what types of monsters lie on the outside. My grandfather taught me about surviving in the wilderness and how to fight. He taught me about martial arts called Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Boxing.\n\nWhen I grew up a bit more he told me about these combat systems. All it seemed to be were just more martial arts to me. I once asked what was the difference between these combat systems and martial arts. He explained it to me in great detail, but I can summarize it here.\n\n“Martial arts is an art, like in the name. It’s made to look flashy, and creative. It’s to end a conflict skillfully and beautifully. A combat system, Is made to kill.”\n\nI got goosebumps on my arms after hearing the word, kill. Such a harsh word.\n\n“These combat systems are made to maim, critically injure, or kill your opponent as fast as humanly possible. They aren’t made to be beautiful or flashy. It’s why I waited a long time to teach you about these systems, I needed to know you wouldn’t abuse your power and go around killing people.”\n\nHe taught me about Vacon, Krav Maga, and Silat. \n\nHe told me that I will never be bested by another human being in my life.\n\nI’m 19 now, and I still practice all these martial arts to this day, gramps always told me to never stop practicing. The more repetitions I do, the closer to perfection I become. I’ve gotten bigger and stronger from all my training, so I became a junior adventurer.

        "text": "June 13th\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA loud piercing scream cuts through the quiet night sky. Its crying weeping shrills. It’s probably another person being torn apart by the wild dogs again. We always tell them to not go past the borders at night, but they never listen. They usually don’t come back, but the ones that do aren’t the same. Chris. Chris was a pretty cool and funny guy before he left, always bringing the mood up when it was sour. He went out one time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe came back with his clothes in tatters, cuts, and bruises all over his body. One of his eyes was gouged out, leaving a deep pit of emptiness in the socket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\tAfter he recovered from his injuries he wasn’t the same, I noticed he never had his back to a large group of people, and he constantly looked over his shoulder as if searching for something stalking him. His eyes, well, his eye always had bags under them. He must’ve constantly been awake out there trying to survive and he never got rid of the feeling. His pupil has always been a large dark circle of nothingness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\tI’ve also noticed he tends to stay away from light, he keeps away from campfires and his room lights are always off. I’m not sure what's up with that, I’d imagine after being in the dark for several hours straight you’d want to stay in the light as much as possible. Speaking of the night, I should explain how the day-night cycle works here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\tSo what I’ve been told is that the day lasts 18 hours in the summertime and 12 hours during the winter. The night lasts 24 hours in the summertime and 30 hours during the winter. There are always 42 hours in a typical day of ours. I heard that there used to be 24 hours in a day before ‘The Falling’, but it just doesn’t sound believable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\tMy grandparents used to tell me many stories about the world before It all went to hell.

        "author": "CornerCornea",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/113e09a/the_doll_house/",
        "text": "I live in a prefecture where there's a house with blue roof tiles and decrepit windows. It once belonged to a family of bunraku artisans who were known puppeteers, and famous for their lifelike dolls. But as the advent of film came along, their popularity diminished. And their children, in order to make ends meet, slowly began leaving the family business in search of other ventures. Eventually, the home was abandoned.\n\nOver the years, the local officials have made promises to tear the place down. But each time, the cranes and workers would quietly disperse before anything was ever accomplished. And as residents of the area, most of us knew better than to ask what became of the demolitions. Instead, we hoped that one day someone would make good on their word.\n\nAnd although many have tried, I never expected to be involved. But there I was, a member of the zoning committee for the Chambers of Commerce, working alongside my co-worker to determine how to expand the nearby shopping district.\n\nMy co-worker, Yamamoto Date, pronounced Dah Tae, was a man with two last names. Which according to my mother, was given to children who couldn't readily identify their fathers. However, the truth is - custom dictates that a man with two last names was difficult to address properly as we often referred to acquaintances by their surnames, and close family and friends by their given name. So it became rather confusing addressing my colleague and friend as either Yamamoto or Date due to the impressions that our department wasn't close knit. Which is important in our prefecture, as we believed that well accustomed workers - signified an efficient system.\n\nWhich was likely why we drew the ire of the local seniors who had gathered around the zoning tape we had masked around the property.\n\n\"Date,\" I had discovered the damage surrounding the perimeter.\n\n\"It looks like char,\" he rubbed the wood post. \"Smells like it too.\"\n\n\"Ahck,\" an old man complained. \"They don't even know about the fire in '83.\"\n\n\"Did the officials send us newcomers,\" a woman from the gatherers asked.\n\n\"No, it seems that man's name is Date,\" another voice answered.\n\n\"Hmm,\" came the consensus.\n\nI whispered to my friend, \"And that is why you'll never attain great office here.\"\n\nHe chuckled, \"My mother thought it was clever giving me two last names so that I would always be addressed formally. I bet she never expected that to become a problem, as we didn't live around here.\" He stood up and approached the older man. \"Sir, it seems as if you are well informed of the events which happened on this property. Could you please explain to us what happened in '83?\"\n\nThe old man cracked his dry lips, \"There was a boy who wandered inside the house. He was missing for 3 days before the other students would admit that they had dared the boy to go inside and sleep with the dolls for the night.\"\n\n\"Dolls?\"\n\n\"Yes. The dolls. Have you been told nothing?\"\n\n\"I have been briefed by my seniors,\" Date admitted. \"However, I wasn't aware that there were still belongings inside.\" He turned to me, \"Perhaps we would have to document and store all of the items in case the family comes looking in the future.\"\n\n\"Bahh,\" the old man grunted. \"They're never coming back here.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Not after what happened to the mother,\" the old man spat.\n\n\"Genji,\" a woman clicked, \"Do not spread false rumors.\"\n\nGenji's eyes widened, \"Rumors? How is it a rumor when we have all heard it. Still scrawling around at night. Waking me up. Disturbing my sleep. Giving no decency or regards to the tired. Bahh.\"\n\nThe woman clicked her tongue again, \"Just let them do their investigation. Do not put ideas into their heads.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, if you don't mind. I would quite like to hear about what happened,\" Date said. Turning to Genji, \"It could prove invaluable.\"\n\nGenji scoffed, \"See Chibi. I'm doing the community a service.\"\n\n\"Then it is well gossiped that the daughter of the household gave birth to a doll.\"\n\nAt this the others gasped.\n\n\"Chibi,\" they hushed. \"It can hear you.\"\n\n\"That was my line,\" Genji grumbled. \"Bahh,\" he said while wobbling angrily away. \"I hope the house takes you ' yah old hag.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Date told me as the crowd began to thin. \"We have to get the proper documents for this.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral days later we would learn of Chibi's passing. Many suspected that an ongoing feud between her and Genji was the cause of her demise. However, when the newspapers reported her death, they included a photo of the alleged crime scene. And it was the way she was positioned, that made me believe otherwise.\n\nIt looked as if someone had propped her up against the wall and held her hands at a certain angle until rigor mortis set in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Date and I finally returned to the Doll House, the place was deserted as the scandal nearby took all of the attention. Which left us alone with the house for the first time. It was eerie to stand in the lawn where the overgrown weeds had pushed aside the pebbled walkways. The rancid wood porch looked as if it would snap in half at our weight. And the rice paper screens were pocked full of holes from lack of attention over the decades where it has stood undisturbed.\n\nA feeling in my gut knotted as Date slid open a door he had discovered to be unlocked.\n\nAnd I was glad that we were at least met with much of the same dust that had settled on the exterior. For me, it meant that no one had been occupying this space. At least, no one physical.\n\n\"I thought they were supposed to turn on the power,\" Date exclaimed. \"Not that there's much electricals in here,\" he mused.\n\n\"It was already old before it was abandoned,\" I agreed. \"The deed pins the original foundations to around the Edo period.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the rats have chewed through the wiring?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I snapped a few photos. \"It looks like we're going to need a moving crew after all.\"\n\n\"I wonder why this wasn't noted by the local clerks?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they were,\" I commented, \"But the records were lost after the war.\"\n\n\"That or digitization,\" he added. \"Shame that we have to cart this stuff off to a storage somewhere. Antiques are profitable today, you know.\"\n\n\"Don't even think about it,\" I snapped a photo of him holding an old paper weight from the writing desk.\n\n\"Come on,\" he smiled. \"Let's go deeper inside the house.\"\n\nWe had explored several rooms that were filled with a musky odor, and I had adapted quite well to the smell by now, when a sudden wafer thin stench came from behind a door we had yet to enter. While every single panel we had come across, showed signs of age. This one looked untouched.\n\nDate reached for it and I almost stopped him. But as this was our duty, I watched transfixed as it opened.\n\nInside were hundreds of dolls lined up against the walls. Some sat on the floor, others on shelves. No matter their positioning, they were stacked shoulder to shoulder, front to back in neat sequences, facing outward. Each of them unique and ranging in size.\n\nI let out a gasp as my flashlight beamed into a corner where a stark figure stood against a second doorway at the end.\n\nDate laughed when it turned out to be nothing more than a doll about his height, \"Almost looks real, doesn't it.\" He motioned for me, \"Well come on then,\" as he walked over and stood next to the doll. \"Take a picture.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"What? Come on now. For our report.\"\n\nI sighed and reluctantly snapped a photo, the bright light consuming the darkness, and when I looked up. Date was missing.\n\n\"Date,\" I called out. He didn't answer. I shined my flashlight across the seemingly endless row of dolls that this room was built for. \"Yamamoto,\" I shouted angrily. \"Stop messing around.\" Still he did not answer. I could see the doorway at the end slightly ajar when it had been closed earlier.\n\nI took a single step forward to order give to him an earful about his manners when I heard my feet crisp the board beneath me. And jumped as the door behind me slammed shut! I nearly wet myself as I scrambled to the other side. My flashlight bouncing across the top of the dolls heads.\n\n\"Yamamoto,\" I shouted. \"This isn't funny.\"\n\nI heard a scratching nearby and so I aimed my light in that direction, skipping over the rows of sculpted faces until one of them blinked.\n\nIt was all I needed to to see before running through the doorway on the other side where I came crashing headfirst into Date as he tried to hold me upright. \"What's wrong,\" he asked me.\n\n\"Date,\" I almost screamed. \"Where did you go!\"\n\n\"After you took the photo, I saw this behind me. Look!\"\n\nThe room was unlike any of the others we had seen. It was taller than any cathedral I had ever been inside, so dark that our flashlights shied away from the top as they gleaned the entrenched floor. There on the ground was a miniature city.\n\n\"It's a scaled version of the area,\" Yamamoto exclaimed. \"Look, I can see my house,\" he pointed to a nearby corner.\"\n\n\"Yamamoto,\" I told him. \"You don't understand. I saw a doll blink.\"\n\nHe waved me off, \"That's common with old dolls. I believe my sister had one growing up that could pretend to sleep as you laid it down.\"\n\n\"T-the door,\" I stuttered. \"It slammed shut behind me.\"\n\n\"Spring loaded,\" he answered. \"Most of the ones I opened were. Really expensive back in the day. Difficult to build properly too. But an easy task for doll makers.\" He pointed, \"Would you look at this. It's the doll house.\"\n\nHe reached forward to touch it, and that was when something came out of the corner and grabbed him. I screamed as the they struggled. The light splitting the darkness as their labored breathing filled the room. Several times I tried to help, until finally a blow struck me and I fell backwards hard on the floor, enough for my head to bounce causing my camera to crack.\n\nI could hardly discern the blotted figures in front of me as my vision blurred. But by the flashlight on the floor I could make out a hunched figure, white as porcelain, with long gnarled arms and squanched legs. It lifts Yamamoto's body and slams him down several times on the floor before dragging him away into the back of the room, back into the darkness.\n\nI screamed and tried to run, but the door was sealed shut. And no matter how much I struggled I couldn't get it to open. I banged on the frame to no avail, crying as I heard the snarling and crunching of bones behind me. But then it stopped. And the room fell silent.\n\n\"Date,\" I cried out. Afraid to look. But eventually forcing myself to face the seemingly empty room. I took this chance to find my glasses on the floor and backed into a dark corner. Half afraid that something would reach out from behind me and half afraid that the creature would appear again in front.\n\nI pressed my shoulders against the wall and slowly crept over to the door. I tried it again. But it would not budge. Helpless. I did the only thing I could think of, and that was to crawl forward and grab the flashlight. Slowly panning the light across the room when I heard a noise.\n\nIt was then that I realized that something was moving. Inside the miniature city. I shined my light down and saw tiny figures moving through the streets. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, causing me to lean forward on my hands and knees until I could get a better look.\n\nDolls.\n\nTiny animatronic dolls, that were moving throughout the city. Cars even, their tiny plastic wheels skimming the road as they made stops and turns. It almost looked as if the city were alive.\n\nThey were moving so perfectly that it almost looked magical.\n\nAnd as I drew closer, I noticed something else unusual. It was difficult to see, so I got even closer, until I was nearly standing inside the city. I saw the doll of a woman walking along the side of the road. She looked so lifelike that her hair even moved as if it were windy, but it moved oddly as pieces of it were stuck to a nearly translucent string attached to the top of her head. I got even closer and touched it. The doll nearly tripped, but I didn't care, as I followed the string upwards with my finger and shining the light to the ceiling.\n\nThere were masks looking down at me!\n\nThey dotted the upper banisters like owls in a barn. My knees buckled as I backed roughly into a corner, pulling out my phone and dialing the police. I was so relieved that an operator picked up that I immediately began screaming for help. I told them that I was at the Doll House and that there were people inside. That they had killed my friend! The officer on the line kept reassuring me that they were sending help right away.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" I shouted to the masked people above me. \"They're going to come get you. You're all going to jail! So stay away from me!\"\n\nBut still they watched me, silently as I talked. Never stopping me.\n\nAnd it was from my corner cornea that I saw it, from a pile of buses and cars on the floor, a police vehicle righted itself and rolled onto the board. It ran all of the red lights, and the dolls in the miniature city turned their heads as it passed.\n\nThen as if a curtain were slightly drawn, a window appeared to the left of the room. And I realized that we were now looking at the same street that was being shown on the board. There was even a real live police vehicle zooming toward us. I see the red and blue lights punching the sky as the siren wailed in the distance.\n\nI was still smiling as I turned around at the sight of my rescue. But I stopped smiling when I saw that the creature had reappeared and was standing on the other side of the room. It reached a long skinny arm across the city, and with its finger it pushed the police toy on the board away as it neared the Doll House, using its withered nail to guide the car down the street until it rolled off the board and onto the floor.\n\nBehind me, I could hear the police sirens disappearing. Their sound growing further and further away.\n\nThe creature slowly backed into the darkness. And the door opened.\n\nI stumbled out of the room, and back into the hall with the dolls. I fell several times as I ran away. The doors shutting behind me after every threshold until I found myself back on the lawn outside, panting.\n\n\"They tried to burn it too.\"\n\nI jumped at the voice behind me. It was Genji, and he was leaning against the wood fence.\n\n\"But all that did was cause the lights to go on for a few years. After the house swallowed the fire. Made it worse if you ask me.\" He then scratched the top of his head as if pulling on something. \"It's best if you leave it alone now.\"\n\n\"What,\" I managed. \"I can't do that. What about Date?\"\n\nThe old man cracked a smile, \"He'll be back. You'll see.\"\n\nAnd Genji was right. After I had made numerous reports to the police and my superiors. They were squashed. And I was deemed overworked, the moment Date came through the doors on Monday. Completely unharmed and unblemished. Except now, he only answered to Yamamoto.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[s](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/111m676 Previous: https://redd.it/112j8ei )\n\nNo matter how much I wanted to interrogate Jackalope about his previous job, I refused to put any kind of pressure on him for the first week he stayed at my place. He needed to get settled in and hadn’t fully adjusted to missing an arm. He made attempts to help out around the house, but was pretty slow doing chores. \n\nMy new roommate quickly got a new job. I told him he should take a break and let himself fully heal, but he refused to not contribute towards the bills. The new job had great benefits. His eyesight was fixed to the point where he just had bad night vision. His left eye was still a dull blue instead of a soft brown though. I had no idea people who delivered mail got such great medical care. \n\nOver breakfast Jackalope finally decided he wanted to tell me what he was able about the still unsolved clipped cases, and a little bit about his job now. I left the dishes to be washed later and met him in the living room. He honestly got along pretty well with Pesto. He and that rabbit might as well be made for each other. \n\n“I guess I need to start by telling you supernatural things are real.” Jackalope said as he let Pesto chew on his shirt sleeve for a few seconds. \n\n“What does that mean? Like... are vampires real?” I asked starting to process what he said. Then I leaned over to whisper. “Are you a vampire?” Mostly as a joke. \n\nJackalope took my terrible sense of humor well. Pesto decided he didn’t and hopped away to create some sort of mess we needed to clean up later. \n\n“I’m... something not human. Let’s leave it at that for now. And let’s just leave it vague on what kind of supernatural things are out there or else we would be here all day. I don’t even know every creature that are care real or not.” He explained and moved to sit on the couch. \n\nI would need to force more information out of him later. For now, I accepted what he was saying. I sat in my chair and kept an eye on our troublesome rabbit. \n\n“Those deaths that happened... they weren’t natural. How much about them have you not told me?” I pressed hoping he would drop something that may finally solve those cases. \n\n“When I was an Agent, I mostly worked on cases relating to cults or Gods.” He said as if that statement was normal. \n\n“Gods? Like... What? The God? Is there more than one?” I pressed. \n\n“I cannot confirm or deny the Christian God, or any other kind for that matter. We call creatures with power beyond understanding Gods. They can be kind, or... not so kind. Most of the time they’re just that. Beyond any kind of understanding. We suspected the clipping cases were caused by a certain dark God. After I prayed to him and offered anything of mine for your life, we confirmed it was the God behind the deaths.” Jackalope said with a strained smile. \n\nHis missing arm and scarred face were a touchy topic for both of us. I tried not to bring it up at all if I could help it. He didn’t dwell on that detail, so I didn’t remark on what kind of life debt I owed him. \n\n“Does this dark God have a name?” I asked wondering if this creature was on the same level as Lovecraftian Gods. \n\n“He decided to go by Dan.” Jackalope said with a shrug. \n\nIt was like time stopped because of how unimpressed I felt. Dan? A dark God beyond human understanding and killed at least four people I knew about in a gruesome way picked the name Dan? Jackalope saw my expression and shook his head. \n\n“I told you it wasn’t possible to understand them. This God-” \n\n“Dan.” I cut in.” \n\n“Dan,” Jackalope sighed and went on. “Has agreed to stop the clipping cases if someone can guess the reason behind them. He is letting every person take one guest. We were collecting information to see if there had been any similarities or anything we could work with on those cases. No luck so far.” \n\nJackalope made a move to cross his arms before he realized he was missing one. He just leaned back on the couch instead. He looked upset over these murders would keep happening. \n\n“Could I take a guess?” I offered. \n\nWith a nod, he sat up again. \n\n“I don’t see why not. Even if it’s wrong, we could eliminate a possibility.” He agreed.  \n\nAt least that was something. A wrong guess still helped. I asked if I needed to get in contact with his old work to do this. He shook his head and got up to head to the spare bedroom I'd let him take over. Jackalope didn’t own too many things. I’ve gone out and bought him some clothing the past week because he only had three sets of shirts and pants beside his suits. He came back shortly with an object in his hand that gave me chills. He set it on the coffee table and then wrangled Pesto to put him in the other room. I didn’t want our pet rabbit to be near this thing either. \n\nI stared at the small black tablet made of some sort of polished stone. The same cursed object that Jackalope prayed to save my life. Had this thing been inside the house the entire time? I didn’t like that fact, but I didn’t feel the same kind of power coming off the small stone as before. It looked creepy as hell, but it didn’t strike dread in my heart. \n\n“It’s like a phone call. Unless he picks up, the stone is powerless.” Jackalope said. \n\nI got up to stand next to the small slab, but Jackalope brought it closer to himself.  \n\n“You don’t have to talk to him if you don’t want to. He nearly killed you.” My friend pointed out. \n\nThe new scar on my stomach hurt a bit at his words. I haven’t forgotten that night. It’s a miracle I’ve been able to get any sleep after that brush with death. But I knew no matter how much I dislike the idea of getting in contact with the monster that almost killed me, I needed to do so to try and save others. \n\nI gave him a nod showing I felt ready enough to try out this crazy idea. Jackalope didn’t like it but respected my resolve. \n\nI didn’t know where to start. Did I need to chant? Bow to the slab? Make offerings? Jackalope sat on the floor and gestured for me to sit next to him. We both faced the small stone slab and waited. Turns out the Dark God was just waiting for someone to try and reach out to him. \n\nThe room became dark around us. The light faded from the corners first and slowly crept closer. I wanted to move my head to look but felt far too scared to do so. Something touched my hand and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I risked a glance down and saw Jackalope's hand next to mine. I didn’t care what other people might think of the action, I took his hand and held it tight. We were about to talk to a creature powerful to kill us without any effort. I needed as much support as I could get. \n\nA sudden pressure came to our backs. I knew without looking something was watching us. Something huge. All at once I understood how bad of an idea this was. It felt different than what I saw when this thing took Jackalope. The God watching us could take my life on a whim. I knew then that the pillar was the kindest death this monster could think of. \n\nThe gaze pressed down on us almost to the point the pressure made me move. I didn’t hear the words but saw the question in my head. \n\nWhy did I kill them in that way? \n\nThe words inside my head hurt like hell. I almost wasn’t able to form any thoughts. It took everything not to buckle under the weight. My heart started to beat so fast it felt as if it may stop. The God at our back pushed down harder. I doubted it really wanted the question answered. My life was at risk, I realized that far too late. If I wavered for a second, that darkness would happily overtake me.  \n\nA set of invisible hands wrapped around my neck. I choked on air, the fear that overtook my mind made me forget everything else. I was going to die. Simple as that. There wasn’t a damn thing I could do about it. I was facing a God. A powerful one that killed humans in such cruel and twisted ways. Just before I fell into the hands of that monster, a feeling brought me back to my senses.  \n\nJackalope squeezed my hand so tightly it hurt. The gesture chased away the hands on my neck. If he faced this God all on his own, then I could as well. I finally found my voice and spoke the answer out loud. \n\n“Because you could.” I barely choked out. \n\nThe silence that followed nearly killed me. Not a single sound could be heard in the room. Just as I thought I may pass out; a laugh tore through the darkness that started to creep ever closer. I finally gulped air, coughing on it. \n\nThe laughter shook the house and rattled my bones. I curled over and brought a hand up to my ear in a poor attempt at blocking out the sound. When it finally stopped, I couldn’t stop shaking. It took me a few minutes to recover. I looked up and saw the stone table cracked clean in half and Jackalope giving me a bewildered expression. \n\nBefore I could say anything to him, the phone started to ring. I faintly heard his cell phone ringing as well. I might be one of the last batch of people to have a landline. But no one ever called it. Jackalope got up and hurried over to answer the phone. My legs refused to move so I just sat listening to his responses. \n\n“Yes, no, not myself. It was him.” He said to the person on the other end while nodding. \n\nI could see him from where I sat. After a long pause, he nodded again. \n\n“I’ll ask him.” He said and then brought the phone against his chest so the person on the other line wouldn’t hear him speak. “Do... you want a job...?” \n\nMy head swam with a million questions. I answered him gracefully. \n\n“Huh?” \n\nI don’t think anyone could blame me for that response. It took a few hours for me to grasp what was happening and what exactly just got offered to me. The company that fired Jackalope wanted to hire me on for some cases. It seems like I did guess the right reason as to why that terrible monster killed innocent people. That gained me some sort of recognition, but they also noticed my profession. A secret company that dealt with taking care of supernatural creatures needed a CSI... for some reason. \n\nOn principle, I wanted to reject their offer. But I saw the pay increase and debated on it long enough for Jackalope to notice. He still wasn’t able to fully tell me what this company was like, but he wanted me to make an informed decision.  \n\n“To be honest, I don’t like the idea of you doing this job. But, working as a CSI may be the safest position you can work when it comes to The Corporation. They pay insanely well. And you can quit at any time. I would say to do the interview and sleep on it.” \n\nAt the very least, I decided to go in for the interview. I might learn some information that Jackalope wasn’t able to give. The sudden job offer took my mind off the fact we both faced a God that day. That caught up to me and I found my legs shaking. I needed to sit down, my head swimming for everything that happened in such a short amount of time. \n\nThankfully my new roommate collected the two pieces of the slab and took it outside. We would never have a need for such a cursed object. I think he threw it over the fence into the neighbor's yard, but I wasn’t certain. He soon came back into the living room to collapse on the couch next to me. \n\n“I could have died.” I said out loud, the shock wearing off. \n\n“If I knew that was a possibility, I never would have let you place that call. I may have drawn that God’s attention onto you because I asked for your life. But we now don’t need to ever deal with him again.” \n\nI chewed on my lip, thinking of the most important question unsure if I wanted the answer. After finally knowing why those people died, I didn’t feel any sense of closure. \n\n“What happens to the cases? Are they going to be unsolved forever? Is that God going to be punished for what he did?” I asked mostly to myself. \n\nJackalope thought about his answers. He knew anything he said would be unfair. It was hard for him to admit what he was about to say. \n\n“The Corporation may stage some sort of end for those cases in order for the families to fully bury their loved ones. For cases like this that have a supernatural cause, they always do a cover-up. And... No. I don’t think the killer is going to be punished in any way. He’s too powerful for almost all of the Agents currently working. The few that can do something about what he's done... Are far too valuable to risk avenging a few human deaths.” \n\nI didn’t have a high opinion of his old job before, but now I really disliked it. He noticed my expression and finally smiled. After getting scared to death, the expression was a welcome one. \n\n“The Corporation makes hard decisions, but its main goal is to protect humans from the supernatural. I know it's hard hearing they would let a God go free for killing humans, but they’re doing so Agents can live and keep saving as many people as possible. The Corporation has done a great deal I don’t agree with. But I understand it.” \n\nI nodded knowing what he was getting at. I was on the fence if I wanted to work for a company that operated like that. I wanted to help save lives as much as I was able, but could I stomach the costs?  \n\n“Speaking of disagreeing with hard calls... If you do accept the job, I would prefer it if you did not work in the department Lupa oversees.” Jackalope said interrupting my thoughts. \n\n“Lupa?” I asked trying to think if I recognized the word from somewhere. \n\n“He’s one of the office supervisors. They decided what Agents go to what cases. He's good at his job, but... We just don’t get along. Working for anyone would be better for you.” \n\nI wanted to press him on what he meant but could tell he wasn't going to say anything more. Jackalope only held back information for my benefit. If I knew what really went bump in the night, I might not be able to sleep again. And if he talked more about his previous boss, I wouldn’t be able to objectively consider taking the job.  \n\n“I'll keep it in mind. Did they say when this interview is?” I asked, wondering what exactly was said over the phone. \n\nHe shook his head and told me a text would be sent within the next few hours with more details. I accepted that answer and decided I needed to get some rest. My stomach refused to stop hurting from stress after our encounter. Jackalope also looked exhausted. I didn’t bother him with any more questions for the rest of the day and just let him play with Pesto and take naps. I think he needed an easy day. \n\nBecause Lupa was a very busy man, our interview was arranged very late. He requested I meet him at ten PM. A worker from The Corporation knocked on my door to collect me for the meeting. I opened my front door and was taken aback after seeing the inside of an office building that should not be on the other side. \n\n“We can connect two doorways together. I’ll show you the way to Lupa’s office.” The Agent told me in a forced cheerful tone. \n\nHe wore a suit and nailed the government agent look. I carefully stepped inside the office and didn’t want to close the door behind me. The Agent reached out and shut the door behind us. I found myself trapped and unable to back out of this meeting. \n\nHe guided us through the office space and down a few hallways until we reached a large door at the end. Large potted plants sat on each side of the door. Lupa written in golden letters made it clear who this office belonged to.  \n\n“Good luck.” The Agent said and quickly left for some other job task. \n\nI wasn’t sure if I should go in or knock. I knocked first, and when I heard no answer, I stepped inside. A wave of hot and humid air hit my face right away. It was hard to know just how large the office space was. Each inch of it had been covered by plants. Some almost appeared alien, and others were just simple flowers. I made my way along the path and found a set of couches in the middle of the forest. Lupa sat with some reports in his hands waiting for my arrival. The only other information Jackalope gave me about this man did not at all help me prepare to see his appearance. \n\nMy friend said that despite Lupa’s height, he could be fairly menacing. I wondered if he had been joking. And why Jackalope couldn’t get along with his boss. After all, he did love rabbits. He should enjoy being around the man I stared at. \n\nLupa looked young, maybe mid-twenties. He wore sharp dress pants and a vest combo. The vest brown with gold accents. His hair was short and a soft brown in a style a bit too fluffy to take seriously. If he stood up, he may only come up to my waist. His pants stopped at his knees and a pair of animal legs crossed over each other. If I didn’t see his ears, I still would have known right away what kind of animal those legs belonged to. His ears stood tall on his head. So tall it added half a foot to his height. \n\nI desperately wanted to touch his rabbit ears. He might look harmless, but I bet Lupa could break my face with a flick of a finger. He brought his golden eyes up to meet mine and I quickly sat down on the couch across from him. Gods, secret agents, and rabbit people... My life had gotten strange. \n\n“Should I have brought a resume along?” I asked as Lupa set down the papers in his hand. \n\n“We already know of your work experience. This meeting is mostly to answer any pressing questions you may have. I assume there are a few.” He answered in a voice that sounded far too adult for his small body. \n\nI have enough questions to fill a book. I started with the simple ones. \n\n“Why ask me to work here? Don’t you have a ton of other people who can do my job? Like I bet most with any career related to law enforcement must know about monsters already and could be a better choice.” I said doubting they only offered the job because I answered a question correctly.  \n\nLupa shook his head, being very patient. \n\n“We are very careful to ensure humans are not aware that creatures of the night are real. Since Law enforcement is more likely to encounter them, we focus our efforts on taking over such cases. Or averting their attention when needed. But on occasion, some cases are... difficult to appear natural.” He explained. \n\nOther than erasing our memories and covering up the death, there wasn’t much they could do to make those cases normal. Even a cover-up might make the entire situation more suspicious. Was it possible for this company to erase memories? Just how much power did they hold? \n\n“So, you want to hire me because I found out about the supernatural? But why would your company even need a CSI? Like, how would that even work? Do you arrest monsters?” I pressed. \n\nLupa paused trying to get his thoughts in order. There was a lot to tell me in not that much time. \n\n“At times we are not certain if the culprit is human or a supernatural case. Sometimes bodies are found, and the police assume an animal did the damage. In reality, it was a creature hunting in the wrong area. Your job is to cover those scenes in the same way you would for a natural case. If it turns out to be a creature behind the crimes, we catch and kill them. If it is a human, we send off the collected evidence to the police to close the case.” Lupa explained in an even tone. \n\nHis calm voice sent a chill down my spine. I wasn’t fully aware of what kind of creatures were out there, but weren’t some like Jackalope? I couldn’t help but think that maybe some kind of creature killed a human in self-defense. If that happened, would they be put to death for the crime? And if that kind of situation didn’t happen, then were there just monsters out there hunting us without anyone knowing? \n\n“You... There isn’t a prison or anything like that?” I slowly asked. \n\n“There are places to hold creatures who are waiting to be put down. Or the ones we aren’t entirely certain of their crimes. On rare occasions, we offer the creature a job hunting down the ones who share the same crime. We lack resources. They are going to die either way, might as well be useful.” \n\nAnother chill went through my body. Lupa smiled, but on him, it looked more like a grimace. I now knew why Jackalope didn’t get along with him. This man was the type to only care about the bigger picture. He tossed my friend aside because he lacked power. No, I bet he got angry Jackalope sacrificed his ability to work for a single human. His future of saving others was cut short in exchange for my life. Lupa was good at his job. His main goal is to protect humans from supernatural threats. And he didn’t care about how many Agents needed to be used up to do so. \n\nAs much as I hated the idea of what this man stood for, I still wanted the job. If I worked for them, then maybe I could help save others. I bet they had Agents doing the crime scene documentation right now. If I freed up just one of them, then they could go and save others I couldn’t. \n\n“I can take the job, but would it be possible to work in a different department other than yours?” I asked and braced for the reply. \n\nAnother forced smile came to Lupa’s face. Instead of small teeth, he showed off sharp fangs for half a second. \n\n“I see Jackalope spoke about me.” He said in a slightly darker tone than before. \n\n“He was fair. I realized we might not get along after speaking with you.” \n\nThe air grew tense at my words. Sweat started on the back of my neck and it wasn’t due to the humidity in the room. Finally, Lupa relaxed with a shrug. \n\n“You’ll be offered cases as they come up. I’ll be the one overseeing the first few because I’m the one who offered to hire you. After a report or two on your progress, you’ll be free to bounce around whatever department you wish. There is no lack of cases needing to be covered.” \n\nDealing with him was almost as bad as dealing with a dark God. With that settled, I wanted to get the hell out of this room. A phone rang from somewhere inside the office giving me a reason to leave. I stood up and brushed against a large leaf of a plant I didn’t know. \n\n“Be careful on the way out. Most of these plants are poisonous.” Lupa said and dismissed himself to disappear into the greenery. \n\nHe might have been joking but I didn’t take any changes. The same Agent that guided me along took me back to a door that led home. The idea of them being able to open a door that led to the inside of my house really didn’t wasn’t appealing. Peace of mind was worth more than convenience. \n\nThe first thing I did was head to the bathroom to wash my arm where the leaf touched. My skin red but that may be from the scrubbing. Jackalope was already in bed by the time I got back home. His new job wore him out. He often took naps while hanging out with Pesto or just trying to do chores. \n\nI kept the bathroom light on as I walked into the hallway looking for a towel. I’d washed most of them and never put them back in the bathroom. The small closet should have a cloth or something. When I opened it, I found it empty of all the extra sheets and blankets. I found that strange. A cloth was on the floor by Jackalope’s bedroom. He left his door open a crack while he slept. I bent down to pick up the cloth and peeked inside his room. With the light from the bathroom, I saw a mountain of blankets on his bed explaining where they went. \n\nHe must be dying under all of those. I made a mental note to tell him in the morning he could turn up the heat if he got cold at night. But it wasn’t chilly at all, which I found strange. I reached out to turn off the bathroom light and my hand froze. \n\nThe idea of being in the dark scared me down to my very core. The feeling of what it was like facing that God came back. It took all my willpower to push those feelings back and not run around the house turning on all the lights. \n\nThat small moment explained why my new roommate took all the blankets he was able. He’d gone into the darkness alone and lost pieces of himself. The cold blackness would always follow him. He wasn’t able to keep the lights on at night without me asking questions, so he kept the coldness away. He also refused to ever speak about this. I knew he didn’t want me to regret the fact he saved my life. \n\nI didn’t know how to approach the topic. But I couldn’t let him suffer at night like this. The next day I worked a regular job. It felt odd seeing a hoarder's death as just a normal day after everything I’d seen. I went shopping on the way home. \n\nI caught Jackalope before he went to bed. I showed him the two items I picked up that day. A heated blanket and block of glass with a rabbit on the inside. If you put the glass over a small light base, it makes the image appear 3D. He understood why I gave them these random gifts, but neither of us spoke about it. He just thanked me and went to sleep, this time with a light inside his room and warm without feeling weight pressing down on him. \n\nI knew if I accepted the job at The Corporation, I would be exposed to more dangerous and terrifying things. Jackalope said it was a pretty safe job, and yet my life would be in danger depending on the cases. Still, I wanted to do my best to put an end to any case even remotely similar to the Clipped body deaths.  \n\nI said I wanted to make a difference in my life. And this was one way on how to do it.",

        "text": "  \n\nIt was one of those spur of the moment decisions that you make when drunk, and you don’t realise until you’re seeing things in more sober retrospect that… Yeah. Better choices could have been made.\n\nI’d been out at The White Lion for my cousin’s birthday party, and the original plan had been to all drive back to hers with her roommate driving. Her roommate had backed out, and luckily for my cousin, her boyfriend had offered to come out and be designated driver. Unluckily for me, they have some of the loudest sex known to man, and there was no way if I went home to hers I’d be able to actually sleep on their sofa – I’d be up for hours listening to them at it. \n\nAnyway, I told them I’d ordered a taxi, which I had done, but after they’d left, I got the confirmation text that it would be a forty-five minute wait. The Lion was still open for another hour or so, but I wasn’t in the mood to sit in there on my phone while the music was pounding, and because I was drunk, I just thought, oh, it’s not that far of a walk home. I’ll just walk!\n\nIt's an hour and a half, if not two, and I live in a village in the valleys, so the main road between the White Lion in this village and home in mine cuts right into the valley side, with a sheer slope on one side down to the river and hewn-back cliff on the other.\n\nI’d say I don’t know what I was thinking, but at the end of the day, I wasn’t thinking, was I? \n\nI was just drunk and a bit thick, and by the time I’d sobered up enough to think more seriously about things I’d been walking for twenty-five minutes and didn’t much feel like turning back. \n\nThe winding road is pretty well-lit, but then, it has to be – there’s thick forestry on the sloping side, the trees tall and old, and it was blocking out a lot of the light from the moon that night, what little could get through the cloud cover. Still though, with the sharp bends and turns in the road, sometimes, there are places where it’s dark at night – the light comes away from the streetlamps and you can actually see the gaps of shadow between the edges of each circle of light, trees making shadows between some of them, or the edge of the cliffs at times. Fog was threatening as I’d started walking in, and once I was beginning to sober up, there was a good deal more of it, enough to add to the shadows and take away from any visibility there was. \n\nI wouldn’t wear headphones on that stretch of road even in the daytime – the trees muffle engine noises, and what with all the bends in the road you can’t accurately hear cars coming; cars aside, a lot of that hewn-back cliff is held up with wire netting to protect from landslides, but they do happen, and you need to be able to hear them. Walking along the side of the road at that time of night, though, it was… eerie.\n\nMy breathing sounded so loud in my ears I felt like it could be heard for miles, and even the sound of my own heartbeat – there was no wind, no sound of cars in the distance, not even the trees creaking. Now and then, I’d hear an animal call like a gamebird or something, or hear a stick break in the underbrush down the valley side, and every time it made me jump a mile. \n\nThey say it’s haunted, that stretch of road – but then, every road in Wales is probably haunted at some point, right? Every road anywhere. If we’ve been about for two hundred thousand years, there must be ghosts anywhere anybody’s ever lived – because they’ve died there, too.\n\nFog had come in, was clinging to the edges of the valley side like skirts against someone’s ankle, thick and white.\n\nI don’t believe in ghosts, and I didn’t walking home that night, but it’s the sort of thing you think about when you’re trudging home in the middle of the night, when it’s all deserted, when it’s frighteningly quiet and you’re shrouded in the night fog. Every time I stepped into the blank space between two stretches of lamplight and was suddenly drenched in whiteness, I felt like I’d dropped into an ocean of the stuff, even though the next reach of the street light was only a few steps away and I could see it right ahead of me. I kept doing a stupid little run through the shadowed bits, feeling heat flush the back of my neck and a shiver run down my spine, and then I felt pissed off I’d even done that, because I was just making myself scared.\n\nI knew when I’d reached the halfway point because there’s a path that comes off the main road and leads about thirty or forty paces down to a public footpath, and I glanced down the hill to see if there were any cars parked there. The street lamp overlooking it was broken, so I couldn’t see very well, but I couldn’t see reflection off a windshield or a car light.\n\nI hadn’t heard any cars all night, or had any drive past me, which was all for the best. I had an old duffel coat on over the top of my dress, and it wasn’t exactly high-vis. \n\nI don’t know why I thought there’d be cars parked down there at this time of night – even if there had been cars parked outside of the public woods, they’d only be doggers – but for some reason I was convinced there’d be somebody. I took a few steps off the main road, looking, certain I’d see something, that there had to be someone there.\n\nIt's weird, when you’re looking for something in almost pitch-darkness and you’re trying to make your eyes focus with not quite enough light to see by. I could see something. It was below the level of the fog, and at first, it was almost like I just saw something flit between the trees, and then when I stopped to stare, I could only see the trees themselves, their silhouette, but then it moved again. \n\nI thought it was just a man at first, because I was staring right down the embankment and the shadow of him seemed to come out from behind one of the bigger oak trees, the really old ones that’s been there longer than my granddad’s been alive. \n\nI nearly said hello, or said something, started to raise my hand, but it was like I was frozen with my breath caught in my throat as it got closer. It wasn’t easy to judge the size of it because in the dark I couldn’t actually tell the distance very easily, but the proportions were wrong, off. I could see the glint of its eyes too high up, and its head was bigger than its shoulders, the eyes too far apart, and it wasn’t moving like it was walking, but just sort of… rising. \n\nGetting closer.\n\nIt should have been making noise. There should have been twigs snapping, leaves rustling, dirt shifting, but there was nothing but ringing silence down there, beneath the fog.\n\nI couldn’t breathe, couldn’t even move, didn’t even dare blink with how it was coming closer, and I wanted to cry suddenly, wanted to scream, because I’d stepped off the path, hadn’t I? I’d stepped out of the light and into the shadows and just like I was scared of there *was* something, it *was* wrong.\n\nI didn’t know what it was, could just see the shadow of it and hear my blood rushing in my ears, so rooted to the spot in terror I couldn’t so much as shift my weight—\n\nAnd then there was a hand on my shoulder, and I actually screamed.\n\nI clapped my hand over my mouth, looking from the man in front of me to back down the hill, but when I looked this time, there was nothing there – no shadow, no big black thing, nothing. \n\n“Sorry, sorry,” he said anxiously – he had been wearing a flat cap, and now he had his hands in front of him and was passing it anxiously between them, turning it in circles. “I didn’t mean to frighten you, Miss, I’m sorry. Just— You shouldn’t be walking this road alone, Miss, just wanted to see you were alright.”\n\nI was shaking all over, huddled in my coat, and I kept looking from him down the hill, scanning for the figure, but it wasn’t there.\n\n“This land in’t right, Miss,” he said, and I looked at his face, trying to see if I recognised him, which I don’t think I did. He had a pointy chin and a slightly upturned nose, freckles scattered on his round cheeks, and he had quite long eyelashes for a boy – they made him look like a boy when he wasn’t, really, I think he must have actually been about my age, twenty-five, twenty-seven, because his voice was deep. “You don’t want to be lingering on it. Can I give you a lift? Where are you going to?”\n\n“Rhyd-gwyn,” I said, and he nodded. \n\n“I’m going through Rhyd, it’s no trouble to stop to let you off,” he said. “I can drop you home.”\n\nIt was late, and I still had gooseflesh all over me, cold underneath my coat, and even as I was double-thinking it, getting into a car with some stranger I’d never seen before in the middle of the night, I was so freaked out I just followed him up to the road again. \n\nI needn’t have been worried: he wasn’t driving a car.\n\nI stood there, staring, at the big Welsh Cob harnessed to the cart behind it, a green-painted thing with a wooden bench on the front of it and a bunch of crates and sacks in the cart itself.  The horse was bright white, not just the mane but its main coat, and I reached out to touch it, felt the heat radiating from it when I brushed my fingers over the side of its neck. \n\n“Come on, brysiwch,” he said as he hopped up onto the bench, settling back with the reins held in his hand. “This is wild country, this, off the road. This road isn’t meant to be here, cut into the mountain as it is, and it knows it.”\n\n“What does that mean?” I asked as I stepped forward and pulled myself up onto the bench. He clicked his tongue and his mare started forward, her hooves making regular noise on the tarmac as she followed the lines of the road. “Wild country?”\n\nHe didn’t say anything, looking forward on the path, and I was so stunned by the situation I didn’t say anything either, just sat there on the bench beside him, my hands folded in my lap and held between my knees. There was a lantern hung on one side of the bench’s back, and I could feel the heat coming off of it.\n\nHe was dressed in a brown wool coat and had his cap back on his head, leather boots, grey trousers. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but despite everything, despite the whole situation, the outfit wasn’t *that* far off to what some of the older farmers wear, and the cart was in good nick.\n\nI’d never seen someone drive a cart on this road – I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone drive a cart locally at all, except for farmer’s fairs and the like. \n\n“You live in Rhyd-gwyn?” he asked casually. I’m glad it was casual – I’m glad he was focused on the horse and the reins in his hands, and not on me. \n\n“Behind the King’s Swan,” I told him. “Just off the main road.”\n\n“I know it, yeah.”\n\n“Where are you going?” I asked him, and he looked at me sideways, gave me a small, warm smile. There was something shy about it, I think.\n\n“Oh, you know,” he said, and shrugged his shoulders. “Home.”\n\n“Where’s home?” Just asking the question made me feel like I’d been plunged in cold water, and that was before he turned away and looked straight on again, the smile fading from his lips.\n\n“A long ways yet,” he said. \n\nI tried to pay attention as we kept on moving, focused on the clip-clop of the mare’s hooves on the tarmac, tried to focus on her and the way she almost seemed to fade into the thick, white mist around us, the fog the same colour as she was so that you couldn’t really see where the horse ended and it started. If I hadn’t touched her, if I hadn’t actually felt her body under my hand, I might have believed he’d bridled the fog itself.\n\nA few times, I looked off over the side of the path, staring into the darkness and looking to see if there was anything else down there, if there were any more shapes flitting between the trees, and the first few times I didn’t see anything.\n\nThe third time – the fourth, maybe? – I saw a dark shape move on a path I knew led down to and crossed over a stream. It was smaller than the other one had been, but it moved fast, and once again, it made no noise at all, no snapping or rustling in the undergrowth beneath it.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat, and I gripped the arm of the cart bench to lean over and look, but the driver nudged me with his shoulder.\n\n“Try not to,” he advised me in an undertone, not taking his eyes off the road ahead for a moment. “Bessie’s got blinders on, it’s easy for her. We have to just not look.”\n\n“Not look,” I repeated. “What did you— Wild country, you said. What do you mean by that?”\n\nHe looked at me sideways, his eyes slightly wide so that I saw the whites of them. “Best not to talk about it, Miss.”\n\n“I want to talk about it,” I said. “You’re the one who said it. Wild country, you called this. How’s this wild country? This road’s been cut through here for donkey’s years – it’s been here since the seventeen or eighteen hundreds when they started up the quarry. What do you mean by that, calling it wild country?”\n\n“Well,” he whispered, his voice so quiet I had to lean in to hear him. “You can cut through country like this, Miss, you can even cut into the mountain a bit. You can put in the road and you can pave it and you can line it with lamps and you can hold back the slides with stakes and boards. You can’t live on it, can you? We can walk back and forth, ride through on a cart, but it’s not really ours, it’s not yours or mine, it’s not owned by anybody. You can’t tame country like this unless it wants to be tamed. It's still wild – especially on a night like this, can’t see your hand in front of your face. A man could get lost on a night like this – many a man has.”\n\nI didn’t say a word, couldn’t even breathe in, and he glanced at me again and came over almost a little shy, said, “Or, or a woman, of course.” He swallowed. “And if you did get lost, you wouldn’t be able to find your way back, would you? Maybe if you made it down to the river, and it was the right one.”\n\n“I saw something,” I said.\n\n“Eh?”\n\n“I saw something,” I told him again. “In the dark, down the embankment, I don’t know what it was, but it was, it was a shadow, it was getting so much closer when you—”\n\n“Listen,” he said, shifting in his seat. “Listen, like I said, Miss, best we don’t talk about that.” He flicked his wrist, moving the reins, and Bessie picked up her pace. “Best we don’t talk at all, as it happens.”\n\nWe didn’t have that much farther to go, but the whole time my heart was pounding in my chest, and it only started to slow down when we came over the crest of the hill and I could see the lights of the village proper. There was barely any fog in town, only the barest hints of mist on the river and clinging around the bridge. \n\n“Here we are,” he said as we came down the main road, already past village hall and the church and the graveyard, and got Bessie to come to a stop.\n\nI hopped down, looking to the sign for the Queen’s Swan, Est. 1802, at the old painting of the swan on it that was faded now – the sign was a lot newer than the pub, obviously, was more like forty years old rather than two hundred. I turned back to thank him, and he was already gone, Bessie and the cart, too – not fading into the distance or carrying on down the street, but just… gone.\n\nI nearly ran the two minutes up the path to home, had my phone torch on even though it was pretty well-lit, and there was no fog.\n\nI didn’t want to be alone in the dark for a second, and even when I got inside and upstairs and into bed, cosy under the covers so that I could finally go to sleep, it was with all the lights on. \n\n\\--\n\n[x](https://twitter.com/johannestevans)",

        "text": "I knew something had been wrong when the flock of sheep came stumbling up over the hill, their shepherd nowhere to be seen.\n\nIt had only been three weeks since I had been in the Peruvian Highlands for my study abroad program and yet there was a lot I had already picked up on. For starters, a shepherd never abandons their flock. The one I had been living with, a man named Thiago, was well along in his years. He had been a shepherd since he was old enough to walk. His entire life was dedicated to the act of herding sheep. He knew their temperaments. He understood their tics. It seemed that he could even understand their senseless bleating. He cared for them and their needs as if they were his own children. There was no way he would simply leave them to their own devices like that. Without a leader, there was no way they would have been able to find their way back. Which lead me to my next thought, whatever happened to Thiago happened not long ago.\n\nYou see, Thiago's farm was tucked away on a flat ridge that was surrounded by the rest of the Andes mountains. In order to get to it, you had to cross through a small valley. It was the only way in and out of the area. The valley itself acted as a sort of natural deterrent for people, be it other farmers or vagrants. During the day, you couldn't tell that anything laid just beyond the hills. At night was no better. There was no direct trail that led back to Thiago's unless you were already aware that it existed. Given that Thiago was the definition of a hermit, there shouldn't have been a way for anyone to have found him, let alone been able to get the jump on him. I hadn't heard anything either. If someone had harmed Thiago this close to home, at the very least I would have been able to hear something. Anything. Sound rarely travelled through there except for the blowing of strong winds and the talking of sheep.\n\nThe sheep themselves were silent as well, making no sudden movements once they all made it back into the enclosure. Whoever or whatever had gotten to Thiago had left them spooked. Dusk had already fallen, plunging the rest of the farm in darkness. The only light came back from Thiago's house. I knew I should have gone out looking for him. It was the brave thing to do. It was the right thing to do. And yet my legs refused to move. I was as frightened as the sheep. I returned back to the house and locked the door behind me. Even if fear hadn't gripped my heart then, there was little I could actually do under the thick cover of night. For all I knew I would just end up walking right into a trap.\n\nI tried to go to sleep after waiting for an hour, hoping Thiago would return. I had decided that I would go searching for him when daylight returned. If nothing else, I had planned to travel down to the nearest town to see what help I could find.\n\nWhen sleep finally found me, it was quickly disrupted by the sound of barking. Loud and sharp, it pierced through the night's silence. I rubbed my eyes, trying to assure that I was actually awake. It made no sense for a dog to be here. Thiago didn't have a sheepdog, not anymore at least. He had told me about one he used to have back when he was much younger, even showed me a picture. A tricolor border collie named Mateo, with slate blue fur mixed with white, touches of brown on its face and hind legs. He had helped Thiago with the sheep, keeping them in check and out of harms way for the better part of a decade. It wasn't until Mateo developed a nerve disorder that he could no longer be a proper sheepdog. When he finally passed a few months later, Thiago did not have the heart to seek out another dog.\n\nThe barking continued on through the night until morning. When I had gone out to find any trace of where the dog had been, I found none.\n\nI went into the city after thoroughly checking the perimeter of the farm. There was no sign of where Thiago could have gone. I was practically certain no one in the city would be of much help with the search either. Thiago was not exactly a people person so I was doubtful anybody would know who he was. Yet, luck seemed to be on my side that day. Someone, in fact, had seen Thiago the other night. A merchant had recalled seeing him hover just outside the town with his sheep, asking people if they were interested in purchasing wool. When no one did, he shuffled off frustratingly towards the mountains. That had been just as the sun was starting to set. While it was nice to confirm an alibi that he was seen that day, it still offered no insight to what became of him. I decided to go to the police. I gave a report with as much information I had on Thiago, which in hindsight was surprisingly little, and they said a search party would be sent out soon.\n\nI returned back to the farm, making sure the sheep were fed and watered before retiring to his house and going to sleep.\n\nThe barking was louder that night. Closer. Previously, it had sounded as if the dog was wandering just along the outline of Thiago's property. Now it sounded as though it was hanging around the edge of the sheep enclosure. Despite this, I did not get up to go check on where the dog actually was. The sheep were bleating but it did not sound as though panicked, rather a simple response to the dogs barks. I fell asleep not too long after, the weight of how tired I had been those past few days finally catching up to me.\n\nThe next morning was much the same. I woke up, surveyed the farm, found no trace of the dog, tended to the sheep once again and headed back into town.\n\nWhen I got to the police station, I was brought into a side room where two officers sat on one end of a table. One of them was the officer I had given my report to. The other, I assumed, was the chief, given that his uniform was much nicer. They took turns asking me questions regarding my relationship to Thiago, how I knew him, why I was living with him, things like that. After explaining to them that I was just an American student studying abroad, they kept me in a holding cell until they were able to contact the American Embassy to verify my story. It took hours. By the time the officer and chief returned, it was already dark and raining. They took me back to the side room where they explained to me that Thiago was dead. His body had been found deep within a patch of underbrush not too far from where the farm was. They told me they believed it was a heart attack, caused by some sort of shock. When they brought me downstairs to look at the body, to confirm the identity, I was horrified. Thiago's face was contorted into a permanent expression of fear; his eyes wide and bulged and terrified, his mouth slightly agape as though caught just before he could let a scream out. It was difficult to see him in that state.\n\nAfterwards, before letting me go, they asked me if I had seen anything strange in the area. Anything that could have scared the old shepherd that badly. I told them that nothing particularly weird came to mind, aside from the random dog that had been showing the past two nights. Their expressions quickly changed, concern clouding their gaze. They glanced at one another before turning back to me. The chief got up to leave the room, informing me that he would contact the American Embassy again, to get me on the next available flight back to the States. The other officer escorted me back to the holding cell as it was the only place where a bed was. He gave me a blanket and hot tea, telling me that for my safety, it would be best if I stayed there tonight. I couldn't understand what it was that they were so concerned about. When I pressed the officer for more information, he hesitated for what felt like an eternity before he spoke again. Looking back, I know he was simply trying to spare me from the truth. I still appreciate him for that. \n\nHe told me that it was possible Thiago was killed by what he called a *condenado,* a cursed spirit. These were souls of the damned that were punished by God, forced to wander the earth again, often terrorizing unsuspecting shepherds by quite literally scaring them to death. When I asked him what that had to do with the dog I had mentioned he put his hand on my shoulder. He said that these spirits were not traditional ghosts as I probably understood them. These spirits had the ability to shape-shift. They took the form of dogs, cats, snakes, even owls. This allowed them to sneak up on people when dusk hit. \n\nI had trouble believing any of what I was told was real. Can you blame me? It wasn't that I was some sort of atheist. I certainly believed that there had to be *something* out there but nothing like this. Ghosts and ghouls were one thing but this... this was beyond me.\n\n Sleep did not come any easier that night either because the moment I closed my eyes, I could faintly hear the sound of barking echoing throughout the silent town. \n\nThe next morning the officer escorted me as I went back to Thiago's farm to collect my things and to see the sheep one last time. The officer had said he found another farmer who was willing to take them in now that their shepherd was gone. As we reached the valley that led up towards Thiago's we noticed there were footprints etched into the mud. They looked like a dog's at first. Yet as we continued up towards the farm, they got larger. Much larger. At the threshold, the footprints were farther spread apart leading not towards the house.. but towards the sheep enclosure. Without thinking I ran, despite the officer yelling at me to stay close. When I reached the enclosure, my knees gave way at the sight before me. Blood was splattered everywhere, pooling in the middle of this.. of this mangled pile of flesh and wool. Entrails were splayed out around bits of bone and hooves. I can still see the sight whenever I close my eyes. The sleep had been butchered, slaughtered without mercy. My body vomited involuntary, the rotting stench barely hitting my nose. The officer grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me away and towards the house. The front door was gone, pieces of its shattered remains scattered about. We got in quickly and retrieved my items. It was clear that they had been rummaged through although nothing was missing. I could tell that concerned the officer though he didn't vocalize it. \n\nWhen we arrived back at the police station, the chief was waiting there with a cab. He gave me a firm handshake and told me to look after myself. The other officer simply offered a solemn nod, his eyes speaking for him.\n\n*I'm sorry,* is what they told me. \n\nThe flight was long and draining, though I was just happy to be back home. Not too long after I contacted my academic advisor and told her that I wanted to change majors. \n\nAnd I thought that would be the end of it. I thought this would be a story I would bring to my grave, a story to try and forget and move on from. But I can't. That's just not a possibility now - because it's found me. \n\nI don't know how. I don't know why. But lately just as I'm about to get into bed, I start to hear a dog barking, just outside of my house. When I finally found the courage one day to look out the window to see where the dog was, I saw it. It's a tricolor border collie with slate blue fur mixed with white, touches of brown on its face and hind legs. Just like the one Thiago used to have. \n\nI don't know what else to do other than write my story for someone to find. If anyone knows anything about these *condenados,* what more can I do? I don't have enough money to just up and leave. If it found me here, I know it'll find me no matter where I go. \n\nThe barking only gets louder now with each night. \n\nAnd tonight, I can hear it barking just outside my front door.",

It’s why I’m here...Jesus, I guess that’s why *you’re* here, too, looking over these pages.   \n\nThankfully, my soon-to-be ex-wife and son weren’t here during this unpleasant discovery. On Monday, Dee loaded a few hefty suitcases into the back of our Subaru and was getting into the car just as I was arriving home from work. My son was in the front seat, buckled in, and distracted by the addictive void of his phone when I confronted her in the car. The look she gave me, one I had grown to know well over the past eleven years of marriage, was etched so finely in her features that I could only stand back and watch as she backed out of the driveway. \n\nOur marriage is in its darkest days, but I don’t care. I haven't called her back, and I don't suppose it has crossed my mind. I have spent *hours* worrying about the spiders in my basement, *hours* contemplating my next moves.\n\nAfter all that has happened today, I’m surprised I’ve managed to find the energy to crack this thing open and start typing. I suppose this will take a while if I’m to tell it right. My thought process is simple: If I continue to sit here against the wall in my living room facing the hallway, I’ll be ready. I can’t say I’ll know what I’ll do, but dammit, I’ll *see* what’s coming. And if they are concentrated in the area where the exterminator says they are, I’ll have plenty of time to make a move. \n\nAnd by making a move, I mean getting the fuck out of here.\n\nI’m not a brilliant man, but I *know* that this vinegar-based repellent stuff won’t repel their wrath. Will I have to use it? Christ, I hope not. \n\n\\*      \n\nAs store manager of the local grocery store here in Newtonville, my work days are usually predictable. However, beginning yesterday, things became exceptionally hectic quickly, thanks to a computer glitch in our system. You wouldn’t immediately think about it, but having an efficient computer system makes every aspect of a retail workday move flawlessly toward divinity. Like a swollen throat, when it becomes painful, you can finally grasp the existential beauty of swallowing. \n\nEverything had been fine last month during the annual inspection. Nonetheless, some corroded wiring in the receiving area needed replacement. Our computers went down a few years ago due to a failed system upgrade. It took two weeks for IT to understand the problem and correct it. I lost two workers during that time; I feared losing more because of a negligent third party. I spent the day on the phone with corporate and assisting my demoralized employees. \n\nWhen I got home that evening, still fuming from the frustrations of work, the house was silent but accommodating. After a few mixed drinks, I began casually entertaining the idea of going downstairs. \n\nI’d been putting off my annual basement cleaning for months by then. I usually get to it during the end of March, but that was around when I began suspecting Dee of promiscuity. And when I got my mind set on something, I often forgot about the world around me. Usually, I became so crazy with certainty I could swear by it. Dee was only a partial piece of my simmering suspicions; That son of a bitch Upton was the border around it, and thinking about pushing him out of that ten-story- \n\nHell, you know the song. Blah, blah. Who cares, right? \n\nAnyway, I put some heavy metal on the stereo in the living room and felt pretty good about myself. It got Dee, Upton, and work out of my mind, as it usually does. \n\nWhen I opened the basement door, I sensed the alien air sigh as if I had disturbed some sleeping presence in the darkness. It was outright dank down there, the air alive, yeasty. I’ve always hated North Carolina summer nights, how they drag around their suffocating humidity like a long, black cape. \n\nTypically when I go down there, I clad myself in steel-toed boots and thick jeans. Last night, I made the mistake of going down in nothing but my boxer shorts. Silly David, I know. \n\nThoughts of scheming black creatures hiding in attic rafters settled on my mind once again, but I couldn’t let these apprehensions interfere with my need to come and go as I pleased.\n\nI flipped the light switch. The bulbs hummed into life as I went down. At the bottom, the concrete floor was cool, brimming with moisture from the earth, and the smell of age and mildew perforated the place. I moved my eyes to the ceiling, trying not to remind myself of that day in my youth.  \n\nThe utility lights obscured whatever perched above my head, so I gave myself a break and scanned the room. \n\nThe curio cabinets, taken from my grandmother's house after she died, were pressed against the far wall in the back. Stacked cardboard boxes, filled with trinkets and fragile collectibles, besieged the old work desk we had. Some of my wife’s childhood regalia piled high in more boxes, thrown aside for who knew. Other items cast away in the basement included a large plastic toy chest my son had grown out of, a few landscaping tools here and there, and a bunch of colored plastic moving containers filled with God knows what. \n\nThe overall goal for the basement was to incorporate a workstation and get one or two of those forty-inch Dewalt rolling cabinets for tools and miscellaneous storage. I realized that a lot would have to be thrown away or reorganized.\n\nI could make out a dense network of fine webs in the tight gap between the far left side wall and one of the curio cabinets.\n\n“Damn,” I muttered. \n\nMy son could help me whenever they got back. It would give the boy something to do besides stare into that damn screen all day. \n\nShadows moved in the corners, probably caused by the A/C blowing in from the top of the stairs, but I was still wary. The place seemed different, its dimensions off. The gin, no doubt, was tampering with my depth perception.\n\nSuddenly, a scuttling noise arose in the rubble next to me. \n\n*Mice*, I thought, as I stumbled for the broom leaning against the wall by the stairs. I would have to set a few mouse traps and put out some poison, too. By the time I finished my project, I would be a notorious serial killer of rodents. \n\nA few seconds later, a mouse zigzagged the stained floor. Cussing, I jumped to the side, using the broom to divert it away from my bare feet. It scampered towards a heap of boxes and out of sight.\n\n“Asshole,” I told its shadow. \n\nI began knocking mummified insects and webs off the lids of containers and moving them aside using the broom as an aid. Though now considerably impaired by the alcohol I had consumed earlier, I was careful not to step on anything that might make me yelp, such as a roach or another rodent. I worked my way forward, now and then peeking inside boxes when I got curious. I know I looked ridiculous, bent over half-naked, prodding at the mildewed objects, sweat gluing my boxers to the crack of my ass.\n\nI’m not convinced everything would have been fine if I had quit right then, put the broom back in its place, and stumbled back upstairs blissfully unaware of the monsters taking shelter in my home. I know that I shrieked hard enough to strain my throat when I pushed the next red container aside. \n\nBright red and white spots flared in my vision.\n\n“*Oh my God!*” I screamed.\n\nA bristly, light brown spider with a leg span larger than my entire outstretched hand sat before me. It reminded me of the pouncing face-hugger in the *Alien* movies, with its legs spread and flattened to the ground. To my horror, each leg was about the width of a carpenter's screw. Its body was plump and hairy. When the initial shock dissipated, I believed it was fake, a goddamn Halloween decoration or something. \n\nBut then its coarse body swelled as if it had read my mind and yearned to make itself known. A leg curled inward. Another leg tottered just above the floor. *Prod me with that thing, and I'll show you what I can do with my fangs*, it seemed to menace.\n\nIn my revulsion, I shouted and stepped back, the hair on the nape of my neck rising.  \n\nIt skittered, tangling itself underneath a nearby object. I fell backward, knocking a bucket of tools to the floor on the way down. Something heavy fell on my lower leg. I kicked at it urgently, caving in a bag of grass fertilizer. *Where is it? Where is that bastard spider?* I thought, my pulse a sledgehammer in my temple. The floor smelt of corrosion and rust, littered with dry mouse turds and the hardened corpses of small bugs. I leaned on my forearms for leverage, slid back a few feet, and started to hoist myself up. Something large was moving up the mountain of boxes at my feet. It climbed up to the top and disappeared on the other side.\n\nI shouted again, more incredulously than in fear. How did a spider that large find its way into my basement?\n\nOut of nowhere, the spider flew off the storage mountain. I groped blindly for the broom handle on the ground, grabbed it, and held it in a death grip. I was unable to take my eyes off of the spider. \n\nIt was a stagnant but swollen mass on the open floor. It sprang forward.\n\nI pushed the broom’s end into the spider’s path, intent on raking it across the floor until it was mush. It clung there despite my violent attempts at crushing it. It leaped for the threatening object with no hesitation, wrestling with the bristles in pursuit of what I can only describe as wholesome vengeance.\n\n“*Come* on, you son of a bitch!” I shouted, still shaking the broom. \n\nThe beast held the broom in a passionate embrace, legs coiled around the bristles. It folded, lurched, and dived. In an instant of wild calculation, I launched the broom like a torpedo into the rubble and made a hopping jolt for the stairs, sure it was already gaining on me and would tackle my ankle.\n\nI slipped, though, and slammed my face into a wooden plank. The unanticipated impact stunned me, but I risked a glance back.\n\nThe eight-legged monster was hauling ass in my direction with a speed I could not believe. \n\nHalf-crawling, half-sprinting, blood dripping from my nose, I clawed up the rest of the basement stairs, using my legs to slam the door shut hard. I dropped to the floor in the refreshing chill of the hallway, trembling, an aroma radiating off of me as thick as the darkness downstairs. There, I sat as I tried to catch my breath. \n\nThe basement door now appeared to be some portal to Hell, and I was frozen, unable to look away from the opening underneath. My body was sore from the escape, and I became aware that I was whimpering. I could fully see the spider in my mind's eye advancing up the stairs like a green beret stalking a retreating enemy. How its long legs curled over the gnarled wood, its bulging, alien body coming to rest, scouting danger with its complex, body-shrouding nervous system.\n\nSomething trailed down my face. On the verge of a manic shout, I patted it quickly and brought back a viscous red liquid on my fingers. I stared at the substance.\n\n“Did I get bit?” I said aloud. \n\nNervous laughter rose in my throat. I had been so horrified by the spider's impending assault that I had forgotten about bashing my head on the stairs only moments ago. Sometime later, I managed to walk to the kitchen and locate a roll of duct tape. Going back, I hurriedly sealed the slit underneath the door. Afterward, I went into the living room and fell onto the couch.\n\nI woke the next morning with crusty, coagulated blood on my face and saw the gash for the first time. It was worse than I thought. I decided to go to the emergency room to straighten it out before deciding what to do next about the spider.\n\nI called the local exterminator a little while later and told him I had a \"major spider problem.\" He began peppering me with a list of questions. When I told him it was only one spider -that I could see- and that it had attacked me in the basement, there was a pause at the other end. I wasn't surprised to hear a touch of humor in the man’s voice. \n\n\"One spider, eh?\"\n\n\"It's a nasty one,\" I said. I neglected to tell him how large it was in fear he'd break down and call me a nutcase. Indeed there were no spiders indigenous to Newtonville of that variety in my home. *Whoever comes will see for themselves*, I thought. After he had taken down all of my contact information, I hung up and continued applying duct tape over the air vents on the first floor.\n\nI was expecting a John Goodman portrayal of the heroic spider executioner like in the movie *Arachnophobia* \\-the only film that ever came close to being an actual horror movie, in my opinion. When the man stepped out of the white van with the *Bug Gone* company logo across the side a few hours later, he was considerably younger than I had imagined. He wore navy blue coveralls and had a five-o-clock shadow. His widow’s peak was already dripping. I met him in the driveway out in the baking July sun.\n\nWe made small talk while he rounded up supplies from the van's interior: a pair of elbow-length gloves, goggles, a respirator, and a red tank with a two-strap harness that he slung over his shoulders like a jet-pack. A hose was attached to the tank and the other end to a long dispenser that he clipped to his belt. I invited him in and watched his face while he observed what I had done to my living room over the past few hours.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, bypassing the fifty-inch plasma TV I unscrewed from the wall earlier and had left in the middle of the floor. \"Thought you said he was in the basement? Did he get out?”\n\n\"The fucker’s still in the basement,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded as he surveyed the living room, and I think he knew I had taken the fast train to La-La Land then. *That’s okay,* I thought. *You won’t* *seem so critical of my actions soon.*  \n\nIn addition, I had flipped both couches on their sides and removed all the cushions; I stacked them outside behind the porch to burn for later on. The glass table in the living room wasn't problematic, but I needed to disassemble it to get at the rug underneath. I had rolled it into a loose roll and struggled with it across the yard. All furniture tucked up against the wall was brought forward and laid on its sides. I emptied all kitchen drawers, the contents from each worth saving I put in garbage bags, tied in triple knots, and set in the garage; the drawers themselves were put in the pile outside with the cushions and would be burned, too. I took down any framed pictures on the walls. And with the air vents sealed, I hardly felt any better.\n\n\"Uh-huh. Where's the basement, man?\"\n\nI led him down the hall to a door I had sealed completely with blue tape. He turned to me, smirking. \"How am I supposed to get down there?\" \n\nI went to grab the box cutter from the kitchen. A sheen of clammy sweat started to ooze from the pores on my forehead.\n\n\"Does that stuff do the job?\" I said, pointing to his tank of poison, the razor unsteady against the sealed crease in the door. \"No games. That stuff will do more than stun it, right? I want it to die...Okay?\"\n\n\"I got the shit for the circus, man.\" He patiently stepped aside and then watched as I cut the seal along the entire perimeter of the door. My heart was drumming.\n\n*It's right there behind the door, waiting to pounce. I know it is. It's going to be right there, BEHIND THE DOOR! OH, GOD! SOMEHOW IT KNOWS WHAT I’M DOING*\\-\n\n\"Hey, man.\"\n\nI looked up at the exterminator, light-headed from bending over. He was gripping the doorknob. How long had I been staring at the crack underneath the door?\n\n\"Relax. I'll find him. Your spider might be nasty, but once he gets a strong whiff of this...\" He cocked a thumb towards the tank on his back. \"...he'll be in spider heaven in two minutes. And if there's more, well, they say if you love your job, you won't have to work a day in your life.\"\n\nHis southern drawl forced a grin out of me, and in my throbbing panic, I almost thanked him for it. My palms were slimy with thick ooze, and I nodded rather than risk him hearing the terror in my words.\n\nHe opened the door, looked back to wink, and slowly began his descent. I expected a sizeable hairy creature to catapult through the air onto his chest at any moment, so I shrank away like a puppy who wants no part in meeting the big family dog. If there were more than one of those things, I didn’t know *what* I would do.  \n\n*Just find and kill the fucking thing,* I thought*. Get it over with. And kill anything else that moves, too. Hell, coat the whole house with poison! I don’t care!*\n\nI quickly shut the door. After a few seconds of heavy foot-falls, there came a distressing BANG. It sounded like he had overstepped and crashed to the bottom. Intermittent curses and harsh grunts drifted upwards. I listened at the door, touching the knob, and then expelled the breath I had been holding when his hasty, slightly amused voice resounded from below:\n\n\"Alright! Busted my ass, but I'll survive!\"\n\nI thought I heard the echo of a laugh, so I relaxed and went into the kitchen to make myself a sandwich. Spider-proofing the first floor of my house had made me ravenous. As I reached for a beer in the refrigerator to wash it down, I heard a bark of surprise from the basement and knocked the beer bottle over onto the floor. It shattered. I rushed down the hallway and pressed an ear against the door.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" he said. The sandwich suddenly felt like a piece of granite in my stomach. He was moving all over the place, hurriedly knocking boxes and containers away to pursue the spider. *Dear, God*, I thought. *The thing will get away. He'll lose sight of it. And then-*  \n\n\"Get back here! I ain't done with you!\" Something made of metal crashed to the floor. The exterminator's voice was full of crazed energy. \"Oh, you *are* an ugly thing! Shit!\"\n\nHe sounded like a madman angrily trying to locate his chemistry goggles. I heard his next words loud and clear with my ear planted firmly against the door. \n\n\"Well, well! Look at your friend! Let's see how he likes this!\"\n\n*Yeah! Cut him down, George! Beat Thomas the Big Boy to a pulp!* I thought crazily, ungluing my ear from the door.  \n\nAn enormous wave of fright overcame me, wrapping me in a mysterious cocoon of pure, spontaneous clarity. It was as if I had been hoisted into a pair of roller skates and pushed. I levitated towards the keys on the kitchen counter and flew through the front door. I landed on one knee on the hot concrete sidewalk. The spout of pain could have been as meniscal as a pinprick because I was still sprinting through the fresh-cut grass, both in body and mind. My breathing didn't matter, just the distance I covered.\n\nThe temperature inside the truck was a notch above sweltering, and I became alarmed when I could not get my fingers to stop shaking long enough to turn the ignition over. \n\n“Thomas the Big Boy Spider ‘gone git you!” I shouted, unaware I was giggling like a lunatic.  \n\nI counted to five and then inserted the key into the ignition again. The truck rumbled to life. I was dripping with sweat, skull throbbing, by the time the hot air turned cool. \n\n*Gonna leave a stranger in your house, David?*\n\n“Roger that.” \n\nI drove into town and turned into the McDonald’s. I got a sweet tea and parked, turning up the radio. The station was playing classic Jackson Browne and Neil Diamond. Although I was aware of the music on the stereo, I could hear the regular lub-dub of blood in my temples. As I started to turn the knob to another station, I noticed a discarded straw wrapper in between the cup holder and passenger seat. Right as I began reaching for it, my hand froze on the passenger seat cushion. I was suddenly so sure -*positive*\\- that there was a set of eight eyes watching me from the back. The door handle seemed a mile away. \n\nI lifted my gaze to the rear-view mirror, expecting to see eight legs reaching over the seat, but saw nothing. Resurgent terror constricted my windpipe. Instead, I yanked the door open and spewed my lunch onto the steaming pavement.\n\nThe exterminator was smoking a cigarette on the steps when I got back twenty minutes later. He watched me pull up the driveway and tipped me a wave. When I got out, I saw that he was heavily perspiring. Rivulets of sweat streamed down his red face. His coveralls were drenched inside and out, the poison tank leaning against one of the porch posts. He exhaled a mouthful of smoke. \n\n\"I sprayed the whole exterior of the house while you were away. I figured you wouldn’t mind,” he told me. \n\n\"Thank you,\" I croaked.\n\nHe looked at me steadily. \n\n“You okay, man?”\n\nI had to urinate badly, but the thought of going back into the house made me shiver.\n\n“No, not at fucking all,” I said. \n\nThe exterminator grinned, putting the butt out on the step and holding it with his thumb and index fingers.\n\n“If there is a Heaven and a Hell, Satan put those things on this earth for his amusement. The ugly fuckers exist for no other reason than to terrorize us.” He laughed, but it was uneasy. He stood up and went to the front door, beckoning me to follow. \"They’re aggressive, man, and don’t like me much.\"\n\nIt had been a chore entering that house again, but going to relieve myself in the bathroom was utterly unthinkable. \n\nI could tell my tape work on the air vents annoyed the exterminator because he looked at the one in the living room and shook his head.  \n\nAs if on cue, he said:\n\n“Mind if I get something out of the refrigerator, man? Throat is a little dry.”\n\nIt was more than that, though. The man was overheated and probably dizzy as hell. I felt bad. He came back with a beer and popped the cap off easily with his thick palms.    \n\n\"I originally thought they were huge wolf spiders,” he began, chugging half the bottle. “But their legs are different, hell, their behavior is different. I may just be the local guy somebody calls out to their house for the routine spraying, but I’ve always been the spider guy to my coworkers. I don't have a degree in the field, but I spend a lot of my free time researching them. I think what you have in the basement are Huntsman spiders. They are scarce around here. Over the past couple of decades, they've been slowly introduced into the lower southern parts of the U.S, but I never thought I'd see one this far north. They're indigenous to Australia, parts of Africa, and Asia. The farthest place north that I've ever heard of them being in is the Panhandle. They can be found in parts of Texas, too.\" He leaned against the wall nearest the kitchen, a hand gripping his heavy-duty belt, waiting for me to say something. When I didn't, he continued:\n\n\"They aren't that mean unless you come across a babe. The queens -my word, by the way- are always bat-shit and hostile. She'll stand guard around her spider nest and not eat for weeks sometimes. If you leave them alone, they tend to be fine. All they want to do is eat the bugs down there. They're nomadic, spending their time hunting and eating.” He took another long swallow. “But I think you've got a pretty pissed-off crew down there. They didn't take too lightly to me storming in and spraying them with my napalm. And- \n\nMy heart hammered. *Crew*. The word turned my blood into sloshing ice shavings.\n\n\"And what? How many were down there?\"\n\n“I’m intrigued. They prefer to hunt alone most of the time. I thought it was just a straggler at first. I counted maybe five, but there's probably -most likely- more. You have a nasty infestation, man. The other thing, well, shit. Now I don’t want to tell you, but...Aw, hell, man. There’s one the size of a dinner plate down there.”\n\nHe recoiled from whatever he saw on my face. \n\n\"*Five? A goddamn dinner plate!*\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"You see, when I saw *that* gal, I nearly shit my pants.” He went on without pause, setting the empty beer bottle on the floor. “Also, when you see a bunch of them together like that, it usually means there's a spider nest somewhere near. A female Huntsman put a nest in your basement, and I’ll bet you a brand new suit that the huge one is our pissy little girl. That's what I think, and how wicked rude of her! I mean, really,” he said, shaking his head, probably in commiseration. \n\n*A fucking dinner plate,* I thought despairingly. *Happy Thanksgiving!*\n\nWords fell out of my mouth like verbal diarrhea.\n\n\"Motherfucker!\" I shouted. \"Are they poisonous? How many did you kill? Did you crush *it*?\" By “*it,*” I meant one spider in particular, but I didn’t have to elaborate any further.\n\nHe grinned, but it was strained.\n\n\"Their fangs *are* large enough to break through the skin, but their venom is not potent enough to cause harm. And, no, man, she got away. Pretty fast...” He turned and seemed to inspect the nearest wall. “Their bodies deflate like punctured tires when they die. Rest assured, a few got their medicine.”\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. An exotic species of super spider had put a *shop* in my basement? I pointed crazily at the floor in the general direction of my despair.\n\n\"That's a big problem...\" I realized I had forgotten to ask his name earlier. “*What’s your name?*” \n\n\"AJ.\"\n\n\"AJ, that’s a big fucking problem!\"\n\nHe was nodding, but I figured he’d heard similar mantras in his loathsome profession over the years. \n\n\"I didn’t see any openings or cracks in the foundation when I walked the perimeter. I’m not even positive about *how* they got in. I sprayed for you nonetheless.”\n\nI wiped the bead of sweat making its way down the ridge of my nose.\n\n“Christ, what a shit show,” I said, more to myself. “I should just burn the whole damn thing down. *That*’ll be my annual basement cleansing.\"\n\nHe went on as if he hadn’t heard me.\n\n\"You can make a water-vinegar-based repellent if one gets too close for comfort.\" His voice wavered as he most likely recalled the *gal* down there. \"Spider infestations are tricky. Other pests tend to be a little easier to kill, but spiders…,” he trailed off. When he finished his thought, I stared at him incredulously and surprised myself with a chuckle. “Spiders are the dicks of the bug kingdom. It isn’t fool-proof, but I’d like to throw a bomb down there.”\n\n“A bomb?” I said. \n\nAJ laughed. \n\n“No, man. A bug bomb. Not a real one.” \n\nAJ called a helper named Rob, who looked younger than AJ when he arrived. Together they went in and set up the bug bomb while I remained outside. When they came back out not too long later, Rob was jittery and wild-eyed. He went directly to the van and got in. Seconds later, he left tire marks on the blacktop as he sped away.\n\n“Thought I was lying. Now he’s gonna quit,” AJ said. \n\nI turned to him. Despite the oppressive afternoon heat, he surveyed the speeding van, hands stuffed in his pockets.\n\n“*What?* Why?”\n\n“Said he would judge how big the fuckers were, I guess to prove he had balls. He almost butted heads with it on the rafters. Came within inches of a nasty surprise. He’s shaken up.”\n\nI looked back at the house. *Let’s hope it works,* I remember thinking. *This has got to work. Christ, this has got to work.*\n\nEvidently, I had spoken aloud, and now AJ followed my upward gaze.\n\n“I’m optimistic,” he said. We stood in silence for a moment.\n\n“Even if the bomb doesn’t work, man-\n\n“*Christ*, it better!”\n\n\"You can always burn the house down and use the insurance money to move someplace else.” \n\nHe winked. I stared at him, then winked back. In a few seconds, we were both laughing. I was not laughing as I watched him back out of the driveway.\n\n\\*\n\nIt's been four days since the bomb went off in my basement and three days since I overheard what Gray said in the grocery store. I thought I was getting better until then. I really did.\n\nA regular at my store, old man Gray was the good-natured type who always came in with that old-fashioned smile and pockets full of rattling loose change. He always came in alone, a lonely widower, and got out not because he had to but because he wanted to. I know it sounds silly, but there was a vibrant aura about him. The staff adored him, and although he'd somehow always manage to stop me mid-task on the floor, I never thought to utter a sharp or otherwise impatient word with him. This Monday afternoon, I was directing duties to my employees and taking care of some of my own when he came in. \n\nThe older man resembled a frightened skeleton; his eyes were more prominent, bulging in their wrinkled sockets. He shuffled up to one of my cashiers and said:\n\n\"Young lady, I'd appreciate it if you could make an old man feel better. It's rotten to come in here and ask, but...\" I crept forward, partially hidden in one of the aisles. He was fumbling in his pockets as if trying to find a few extra cents for a candy bar.\n\n\"Help *me*,\" he continued, his voice shaking now. \"Can you do that, young lady?\"\n\nMy cashier appeared uncomfortable, but she kept her tone steady and leaned forward.\n\n\"What's wrong, Mr.Gray? How can I help you, sir?\"\n\nOld man Gray leaned over the register, and for a second, I thought he was falling asleep right there. \n\n\"Oh, dear. I've gotten into such a fright. Forgive me, but I've never seen one so god awful *big*. Help me. Please. *Help*.\" I could hear the terror in his raspy voice. It was fine-tuned and unmistakable, and I knew what it was then.\n\n\"I left my house for the drug store this morning and came back...Lord, what I *saw*. I got back in my car and left again and came back later. It hasn't moved in hours as if it knows...*it knows!\"*\n\nMy cashier flicked her eyes in my direction, and I stepped out of the aisle. She was saying: \n\n\"I don't understand-\n\nOld man Gray threw his head to the ceiling and howled.\n\n\"*All those eyes! Watching me! It's on my front door, and I can't get near it! Please, somebody help! Please, please, please!\"*\n\nSince bombing my basement, I’ve been researching the Huntsman spider. All of this has done very little to absolve my fears. I learned that they are nocturnal creatures, carrying out meticulous and ruthless attacks on unsuspecting prey at night. Basically, they will eat whatever succumbs to them. Moreover, I learned that they often wander into homes and vehicles in Australia. Motherfucking perfect.\n\nAJ *does* know what he is talking about.\n\nStill sitting in my truck, staring at my front door, I thought of AJ’s words: *Their fangs are large enough to break through the skin, but their venom is not potent enough to cause harm...* \n\nSleeping in the truck isn’t an option; it’s too hot. I’ll have to force myself to sleep in the living room tonight.\n\n\\*\n\nIt's July 30th. This morning, Dee came and saw what I had done to the house. I tried explaining to her that we have a spider infestation in the basement. She wouldn’t listen. When she saw that I had placed all of her belongings -including most of her clothes and jewelry- in multiple garbage bags and set them in the garage, she left in a rage of squealing tires. I don’t have time to worry about it, though, because I think the Huntsmen are in the attic now.\n\nAnd trust me, that is enough worry for me. \n\n\\*\n\nIt's August 1st, and I’ve started a large bonfire in the backyard. So far, I have burned most of the furniture in the house. The fire at its highest intensity was nearly as high as the first floor. If I’m being honest, this brought me comfort, but now I am exhausted. The neighbors are worried about me. They told me they called the fire department, but they have not shown up yet.\n\nI’m wondering what’s taking them so long.  \n\nBy nightfall, the fire was more of a small campfire. Dead tired and drenched, I watched the bright red and orange embers in the coals swell in and out like a torched heart. Tomorrow, if the fire department does not dissuade me, I might get back at it.\n\n\\*\n\nAugust 6th. I don't think AJ’s bomb worked. I have not ventured down into the basement; I have only put my ear to the door. My house is empty. The bottom floor looks like a white room with a hardwood floor. The master bedroom upstairs is cleaned out save for the bare mattress plopped on the carpet in the middle of the room. Not that I have slept on it. I am too scared to sleep, and I dream of large webs when I do. I sealed both sinks with whole rolls of duct tape and did the same to the shower and bathtub drains in case something was in the pipes. I haven't showered. I haven’t brushed my teeth. I think I am losing it, but then and again, I swear I think they are watching me. \n\nAccording to the local paper, last Sunday, the 2nd of August, a man stumbled into an emergency room holding his hand in a fit of agony. *The Newtonville Star* described the incident as an \"infrequent but scary occurrence.\" The victim was interviewed a day later in his hospital bed. Quote: \"It was the biggest spider I ever saw. It leaped onto my hand in my attempt to trap it,\" he told the reporter. \"I guess that's what I get for trying to dispose of it the humane way (laughter). The terrifying part was how hard it was to get off. It scared my wife and me to death.\" He was expected to recover quickly.\n\nTwo days later, on the 4th of August, there was a nasty four-car pile-up on Hwy 70 East leaving Newtonville at around two in the afternoon. A child was killed and five people injured when a red minivan suddenly swerved sharply towards the right shoulder and then turned and crisscrossed three lanes of traffic. One bystander described the scene as \"almost apocalyptic.\" Another bystander provided insight into the terrible accident. The local news station reported on his testimony. Quote: \"I was in the middle lane when it happened. The car was on my right side, and when I looked that way, the woman behind the wheel was flailing around like she was locked in there with a wild animal or something.” That woman received a few deep lacerations and a broken arm, they said. Still, she was \"hysterical\" and \"extremely physical\" when paramedics tried to get her on the stretcher.\n\nLater that day, a black Chevy Cruz rolled down Main Street in Newtonville with the front door wide open. Nobody was in the car, but a few witnesses on the street sidewalk said they saw a frantic man in a white T-shirt jump out minutes before.\n\nA few days ago, I stopped driving the Chevy, not because there was one of them in it, but because there could have been. And let me tell you, somehow that's worse than finding one on the floorboard or looking into the rear-view mirror to see one spread out over the rear glass window. When you fear what lurks in unfathomable places, there is a persistent terror in every particle that grazes your skin, every step you take outside your domain, and every position you try to sleep in. This is what it has become for me.\n\n\\*\n\nIt’s August 7th. Last night I decided I couldn't sleep another night here. I became obsessed with the idea that they were moving inside the walls. With only the week-long clothes on my back, I took the Harley-Davidson northward and stopped in Wilson, a large rural community on the verge of becoming a small city. I booked a few nights at a Super 8 and requested a room on the first floor, just in case I needed to get out of the building in a hurry. \n\nThose bedside lamp-light domes were weak, and I thought I saw a Huntsman perched underneath the air-conditioning unit at the window, shrouded in shadow amid the sickly glow. It was nothing but my ill imagination. Surprise, surprise.\n\nStill...I find myself looking back now and again as I write. *Is* it my imagination?\n\nAfter doing a thorough but cautious search of the bathroom, I took a long shower. As I wiped the condensation from the mirror, a haggard man reflected back on me. I almost didn’t recognize his naked eyes. \n\nI stripped the comforter and sheets off the bed and made sure the room was clear of anything that moved in plain sight. In doing this, I realized I had forgotten my Mac back in Newtonville. I begrudgingly retrieved it, reminding myself not to forget anything else. \n\nBefore I left, I began thinking about that big pile of estranged wood that was once my home. The culmination of these thoughts landed me in a fit of rage that I fear I cannot put into words. Maybe it was what I perceived as hundreds of tiny insect-like eyes staring out at me from the tree line, mocking me. Any home that shelters such evil doesn't deserve to be a home for anything. It drew those Huntsman spiders in, and if I couldn't live there contently, *they* couldn't fucking live there.\n\nI got a call from Dee very early this morning. She had awoken me from a fevered sleep, screaming and sobbing at the same time that our house had gone up in flames.\n\n“*There's nothing left! It's all gone, David!*”\n\n*Tell it to him, you fucking whore,* I thought. It was delightful. It was more than pleasing.  \n\nIt made me laugh, and I knew she could pick it up the many miles in between us. When she had calmed down after a minute or so, I said:\n\n\"At least David doesn’t have a spider problem anymore. I’m sure Upton has a room in that big house of his for all of your precious shit, Denise.\" She was saying something else, but I didn’t get a word of it. I ended the call. \n\nI know better than to settle in, despite the room appearing safe. I may be traveling a lot. Who knows how far north these spiders will travel, carried further and further by some dumb insect-like intuition we humans cannot understand? Who's to say there isn't one underneath the box spring waiting for me to go to bed? Or one behind that cushioned chair in the corner? And worst of all, who's to say that there isn't one currently creeping closer and closer to my feet?\n\nI know one fucking thing, my friends. Fire seems to take some of the edge off, and there are a lot of potential Huntsman infestations in Newtonville and beyond.",

        "text": " \n\nFrom the moment I could remember, I was aware that something was off about me. I had a shadow that always seemed to be lurking behind me, even on the brightest days. It wasn't like a normal shadow, though. It was darker, more malevolent, and it always seemed to be moving in ways that a shadow shouldn't move.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to realize that my shadow was more than just a trick of the light. It was a haunting presence that followed me wherever I went. It was always there, lurking in the corners of my vision, and sometimes even taking on a life of its own.\n\nThe first time I noticed this was when I was walking home from school one day. It was a bright, sunny day, but I could feel my shadow moving in ways that it shouldn't be able to. It seemed to be reaching out towards me, almost as if it was trying to grab hold of me.\n\nFrom then on, I couldn't escape the feeling that my shadow was alive. I would catch glimpses of it moving when it shouldn't be, and sometimes it seemed to take on shapes that were almost human-like.\n\nAs I grew older, the hauntings got worse. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my shadow standing at the foot of my bed, watching me with eyes that glowed with an unnatural light. Sometimes, I would feel its cold breath on my neck, even though I knew it wasn't really there.\n\nI tried to ignore the shadow, but it was impossible. It was always there, always watching me, always haunting me. It was like a dark cloud that followed me everywhere I went, and it seemed to be growing stronger with each passing day.\n\nI knew I had to do something about it. I started seeing psychiatrists, hoping that they could give me some explanation for what was happening to me. But none of them could help me. They all thought I was crazy, that my mind was playing tricks on me.\n\nI tried everything to get rid of the shadow. I would spend hours meditating, hoping to find some inner peace that would drive it away. I even tried getting rid of all the light sources in my house, hoping that the darkness would make it go away. But nothing worked.\n\nOne day, I decided to confront the shadow. I walked out into the bright sunshine, determined to face it once and for all. I turned around to face my shadow, and for a moment, it seemed to stand still. But then, it started to move again, and I realized that it wasn't just a shadow anymore. It was a creature, a dark and malevolent presence that was more than just a figment of my imagination.\n\nI ran away as fast as I could, but the shadow chased after me, moving faster than I thought possible. I knew then that it was too late. My life would always be haunted by my shadow, and there was nothing I could do about it.",

        "text": "At first, I ignored the dripping sound. Figured it was just raining but the drip, drip, drip, just wouldn’t stop. No matter where I go, it’s there. I’ve searched the whole house by now for the source, but no matter where I stand it seems to be coming from just over my head.\n\nCalled a plumber.\n\nThey should be here between ten and two. I’m really hoping for ten. This sound is driving me crazy.\n\nI try to distract myself with music, but no matter how far I turn the stereo up, the dripping is still there, insistent and just loud enough to form a backbeat.\n\nDrip, drip, drip.\n\nThe plumber shows up. His eyes are red, like he hasn’t been sleeping. I explain the problem and he goes to look.\n\n“I’ve been hearing dripping sounds for several days now,” the plumber says from under the sink.\n\nThe leak clearly isn’t there, but I don’t say anything about it. He’s the plumber; it says so on his nametag along with his name, which I’m certain he told me, but I have forgotten.\n\nThe plumber keeps talking. “I’m starting to think is some form of tinnitus because the dripping just follows me around.”\n\n“This drip does that,” I admit. “I can’t seem to narrow down where it is.”\n\n“Well, it isn’t here,” the plumber says, coming out from under the sink. His eyes look even redder now. “I got a few more places to check.”\n\nI follow him around the house. He’s weaving a bit drunkenly, and I start to wonder if that is why his eyes are so red. Just my luck to get a plumber who can’t find the drip because he’s been hitting a bottle of scotch!\n\n“Been getting a lot of these calls,” the plumber slurs. “You’re lucky we could get you in… seems like everyone has a leak they can’t find these days.”\n\n“Just find it,” I say. The tapping, dripping, dropping, clacking sound makes it hard to be patient or kind.\n\nPerhaps that is why the first thing I think when the plumber drops to the floor is, “I’m supposed to be thankful for this alcoholic showing up?” My second reaction is better as it clicks with me that something is seriously wrong with the plumber. I sink the floor beside him and reach out. I call his name, which I only know because it is on the nameplate on his chest. I’ve forgotten his name even as I say it.\n\nHe doesn’t respond. A little pool of blood is spreading on the floor from his nose.\n\nThe next bit happens in a whirl. I call 911 and paramedics show up. One of them has bloodshot eyes, and I find myself staring at that rather than at the corpse on my floor—because by then I know the plumber is dead. He hasn’t so much as blinked since he fell to the floor. They take the body away and leave me with a little pool of blood slowly congealing on the tiles in my kitchen.\n\nWhen I head to get some towels to clean up, I pass the bathroom mirror. My eyes look a little bloodshot too. It is probably the dripping… makes it hard to sleep at night.\n\nThough maybe it’s time to pick up a bottle of scotch. I’m not usually a heavy drinker, but something to help me relax sounds good.\n\nThe next day I’m sitting in my living room with the tv blaring, in a doomed attempt to drown out the drip, drip, drip. A report comes on the news that catches my attention, mainly because I recognize the plumber’s face. The familiar plumber’s snapshot is alongside a few others on a split screen.\n\nThe details of the report are hard to concentrate on. Drip, drip, drip, seems to wind in among the calmly states facts from the news reporter. But even with that, I manage to get the basics. The people on the screen, including my plumber, are all dead. That part makes sense, the rest doesn’t seem to compute properly, even with my limited knowledge of biology and how the body works, the findings in these deaths don’t seem right.\n\nWhen they brought my plumber to the hospital and examined him, there was no brain in his head. His entire skull was filled with blood. He was the first—lucky me to have the first die in my kitchen and leave a pool of blood.\n\nThe others are the victims that have come in since his death. All dead now, according to the newscaster, with her perfect lipstick and wide blue eyes. The CDC has been called in, and the newscaster gives a list of warning signs of this new disease. I barely hear most of it, because it sounds more like a practical joke than a real thing. The only sign I really pick up on is the dripping sound.\n\nThe dripping in my own head wouldn’t let me tune that factoid out.\n\nApparently, all of the victims heard a dripping sound which the doctors and scientists are positing was the sound of blood dripping into their empty skulls, filling the place where their brain was supposed to be.\n\nI turn off the tv and head upstairs to bed despite it still being the middle of the day. People can’t live without brains. Even I know that.\n\nDespite being unreasonably exhausted, trying to sleep is hard with the dripping sound. I can’t escape the repetitive noise. I shut my blinds trying to blood out the sunshine outside and climb back under my coverlet. And I find myself mulling over the tv report. It can’t be real. How would they even know that the people had empty skulls prior to the dripping? Were people coming in to report this to them before dying? And who would ever have thought to look for such a thing?\n\nOutside my window the sound of a siren screeches by, fading into a keening sound in the distance.\n\nBy the time I finally drift off to sleep, I’ve convinced myself I imagined the entire report.\n\nI dream that I’m trying to find a leak in an old basement that smells of mold and copper. I find blood dripping down the walls instead and realize I’m standing in a puddle of it. By the time I get back to the basement stairs it is up to my knees.\n\nMorning comes and the dripping sound seems louder, more like a plop of water into a full bathtub than droplets hitting the porcelain. Like my brain is filling up.\n\nExcept that thought comes directly from the news report that I must have dreamed of.\n\nI go downstairs and turn on the tv again as I make breakfast. There is a dried pool of blood on my kitchen floor. I should clean that up. I’m gearing up to do that as I eat some dry toast for breakfast, but the news comes on and distracts me. Pictures of the local hospital and a new set of faces fill the screen. I see a number, but I can’t recall the death total a moment later.\n\nIt must be hard to remember things without a brain, I tell myself.\n\nI don’t listen to the newscaster’s report this time. Instead, I pick up my smartphone and do my own research.\n\nThe report I heard was real, or at least, the report really happened. Lots of people are calling the disease out as made up, or falsified. But I notice that everyone from where I live is scared. There are more reports of death, wives telling what happened to their husbands, children saying what happened to their parents… and every story starts with a drip that no one else could hear.\n\nI do some research on the doctors who are putting out the insane claims. They were all respectable before this. And their reports now chill me in a way I didn’t expect because all of them are saying exactly what I thought. This shouldn’t be possible. People can’t live without brains, but they are.\n\nThat makes me study the reports carefully, searching for the underlying facts, even if those facts contradict logic. The body count is up in the hundreds now. Didn’t take long, the disease seems like it takes about four to five days in total.\n\nNow I’m sure of what the sound in my head is. It’s a drip, slow and steady, of blood into my empty skull, filling the space left vacant. Drip, drip, drip.\n\nNo matter how much I study the reports, there’s no explanation for this phenomenon, nor why the person dies when the empty space is full. But they do and by inference, that means I will too, unless I can figure a way around the looming fate.\n\nI clean up the dried blood from my kitchen floor, overflow from the plumber’s brain. He should have drained it beforehand and bought himself some time.\n\nHow full is my skull? I’m three days into this awful dripping.\n\nI go out to my car and consider driving away but the dripping would just follow me. When I go back inside, I’m thankful I didn’t try to leave. The tv tells me that the borders to the city have been closed. We are in full quarantine from the rest of the world. Another fact sneaks out to frighten me: over a thousand are dead. And that’s just the ones who have been reported and tallied.\n\nThere are only two things the city is doing now, dripping and dropping dead. That strikes me as funny, and I laugh. I can see my reflection in the kitchen window as night falls. My eyes are a horrid shade of red.\n\nI wouldn’t mind some scotch, but I’m pretty sure that even if there are places open out there, they wouldn’t serve me. No one seems to know if this is contagious, but no one is taking a chance. We don’t know what causes this plague, but the quarantine has people thinking that if it can be contained, that means that we are spreading it somehow.\n\nNo scotch in the house.\n\nI lock all my doors and bar the windows as the night deepens. There are bodies in the street. I can’t find a death toll online anymore. No one is doing anything akin to scientific recording. I find several places where people outside the city are discussing what’s happening. I try to leave comments, but my fingers don’t seem to want to type anything sane. I can locate a few like me typing similar comments. All we talk about is the dripping. Drip, drip, drip.\n\nBut it has started to sound like a ticking sound to me. After all, that drip is my life ticking down to zero.\n\nIn the middle of the night, I hear a gunshot fired. Then another. Someone runs by outside my house, and I’m pleased that they don’t fall down and die. There are enough corpses outside my house. If… no, *when*, I survive this, I don’t want those bodies to be my responsibility.\n\nNo one out there is going to help me. Not those talking about this disease from their safe unaffected cities, and certainly not the dwindling people of the city around me.\n\nI stare at my kitchen floor and think about the plumber. Ending up just like him is hardly appealing. So I won’t. His problem, I decided, was that he didn’t have the information I do. He didn’t know what was happening to him, so he couldn’t address it. He didn’t know that he didn’t have a brain and his skull was slowly filling up.\n\nMy leg up is that I do know those things.\n\nI wonder how we lost our brains and if we can get them back. But those are facts that I don’t have. The people who come after me may have them, but I have to make do with what I know. And what I know is that when my skull fills up with blood, I’ll die.\n\nA smile spreads across my face. I feel it stretching unused muscles. All I have to do in order not to die is to not let my skull fill up.\n\nI head into my garage and dig around in the tools there. I find my drill and bring it inside.\n\nSafety first. I wash and sanitize the drill bit. Then I leave my sink faucet on. I figure I can wash and rinse things as I go if it becomes necessary. Good thing I know my sink doesn’t leak.\n\nI giggle a little. I’m getting silly. It is all the dripping, I tell myself. It is hard to focus with the dripping. And maybe, just maybe, it is hard to think clearly with no brain.\n\nThe best place to go in, I decide, is dead center of my skull. I don’t need to worry about hitting my brain, after all. I plug the drill in, put the bit back where it belongs, and picture the blood coming out of the plumber’s nose.\n\nObviously, that doesn’t work as a drain before death, but I am smart enough to create my own drain. My head would never fill up. Nope. I’ll just let that pesky dripping blood drain out the front.\n\nThe back might have been a better choice, not to mess up my face, but I can’t properly reach back there. Forehead it is.\n\nI turn the drill on and press it to my forehead. You’d think it would hurt a great deal to drill a hole into your head. But the truth is it doesn’t hurt all that much at all. After the first surprise jolt, it is more like a toothache—nasty but localized and the knowledge it would be over soon keeps me going.\n\nThe drill bit pops through on the other side of my skull, I feel it because the resistance is gone and the drill just slides forward. I pull it out and tipped my head over the sink letting the blood drain out and get washed away by the flow of water.\n\nI wonder who else had thought of this as I clean up bone fragments and blood from myself and my kitchen. Then I wander into my living room. I don’t turn on the tv. Can’t hear it over the dripping anyhow.\n\nPeople are screaming outside. I feel sorry for them. I figured it out, I’m safe, but they are still out there in the worst of it.\n\nI go to the window to look out, peeling back the curtain. The world is fresh and new, vital. It looks redder than it did before.\n\nIt’s actually a little hard to see.\n\nOh.\n\nI should have thought of this. The blood is draining into my eyes. No dripping now, but there is a lot of red, more than a tiny drip should account for. I can’t see anything through the blood drip, drip, dripping over my eyes.",

        "text": " \n\nI woke up to a strange noise coming from the attic. It was a low, guttural growl that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but then I heard it again, louder this time.\n\nI got out of bed and tiptoed to the hallway, listening for any sign of the noise. It came again, a deep and menacing growl that seemed to be coming from above me.\n\nThat's when I remembered that we had no pets, no wild animals, and no explanation for the noise. I was alone in the house, or so I thought.\n\nI slowly made my way up the creaky stairs to the attic, my heart pounding in my chest. The growling continued, louder and more insistent now as if it was warning me to turn back.\n\nBut I was determined to find the source of the noise, so I pushed open the door to the attic and stepped inside. It was dark, with only a small sliver of light coming from a crack in the roof. I couldn't see anything, but I could feel something watching me.\n\nAnd then, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw it.\n\nThere was a figure in the corner, huddled in the shadows. It was crouched down, with glowing eyes and bared teeth. I couldn't make out what it was, but I knew it wasn't human.\n\nI tried to back away, but I was frozen in fear. The growling grew louder, and then the figure lunged at me.\n\nI screamed as it tackled me to the ground, clawing at my face and biting my neck. I could feel its hot breath on my skin, and I knew that I was going to die.\n\nBut then, suddenly, it was gone. The growling stopped, and the figure disappeared into the shadows. I stumbled to my feet and ran out of the attic, slamming the door behind me.\n\nMy heart was racing as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. What was that thing? And why was it in my attic?\n\nFor weeks, I tried to ignore the strange noises coming from the attic. But every night, the growling would start up again, and I knew that it was still up there, waiting for me.\n\nI tried to tell myself that I was just being paranoid, that there was a logical explanation for the noises. But then, one night, I woke up to the sound of scratching on my bedroom door.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination. But then the scratching grew louder, more insistent. And that's when I heard the growling again.\n\nI tried to ignore it, to convince myself that it was just a stray animal outside. But I knew deep down that it wasn't. It was that thing from the attic, and it was trying to get to me.\n\nI started to see it in my dreams, too. It would appear as a shadowy figure, always watching me from the corner of my eye. I couldn't escape it, no matter where I went.\n\nAnd then, one night, it finally showed itself again. I was walking down the hallway when I saw it, standing at the end of the corridor. Its eyes were glowing red, and its teeth were bared in a snarl.\n\nI tried to run, but it was too fast. It tackled me to the ground, pinning me down with its claws. I could feel its hot breath on my face as it growled in my ear.\n\nI thought I was going to die. But then, suddenly, it was gone again. I stumbled to my feet, gasping for breath, and ran out of the house.\n\nI never went back. I sold the house and tried to forget about the creature that had haunted me for so long. But it was impossible. Everywhere I went, I felt like it was watching me, waiting for me to let my guard down.\n\nI started to research the creature, looking for any clue as to what it could be. I found stories of other people who had encountered similar creatures, and they all had one thing in common: they had never been able to get rid of them.\n\nI realized then that I was never going to be able to escape it. It was a part of me now, a shadow that followed me everywhere I went.\n\nI started to lose my mind. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't think about anything else. I was consumed by the fear of what was lurking in the shadows.\n\nAnd then, one night, it came for me again. I was walking home from work, trying to keep my head down and avoid any dark alleys, when I heard the growling again.\n\nI turned around, and there it was. The creature was standing in the middle of the street, its eyes fixed on me. I tried to run, but it was too fast. It tackled me to the ground, pinning me down with its claws.\n\nAnd then, something strange happened. As I looked into its eyes, I saw a glimmer of recognition. It was almost as if it was trying to communicate with me.\n\nI don't know how, but I understood what it was saying. It wanted me to come with it, to leave everything behind and join it in the darkness.\n\nI was tempted, for a moment. The fear had become too much for me, and the thought of being able to escape it was tempting.\n\nBut then, something snapped inside me. I realized that I couldn't give up, couldn't let this creature win. I fought back with everything I had, and finally, it released me.\n\nI stumbled to my feet, gasping for breath, and ran. I ran as fast as I could, not stopping until I was miles away from the creature.\n\nI don't know what happened to it after that. Maybe it found someone else to haunt, or maybe it disappeared into the darkness.\n\nAll I know is that I'll never forget the fear that it instilled in me, the terror of knowing that something was out there, waiting for me in the shadows. And I'll never stop fighting, no matter what comes my way.",

        "text": "I was five years old when my mother told me to stay away from school buses.\n\nSpecifically, yellow school buses.\n\nIt was on her death bed. Cancer. I didn’t really understand what was going on, except that my mom was going away for a while, and I wouldn’t be able to come with her. It was before Christmas, and snow was falling outside the window. I had jumped onto mom’s hospital bed, crawling over her frail body and situating myself next to her—ready to eagerly tell her about how excited I was about the snow, and that it meant that Santa was coming, when she grabbed my hand, and her grip had been firm enough to shatter my excitement. Dad had gone to get snacks, and grandpappy was asleep by the window. It was just mom and me. \n\nI remember trying to tug from her grasp because it hurt a little. I mean, it was enough to panic me. Mom never grabbed me like that—but when I looked into her eyes and caught her expression, a desperation and pain I wouldn’t yet understand, I stopped trying to pull away from her. Mom’s smile had been thin. I knew she was trying not to scare me, though at the same time making sure to plant the words into my head and taint them into my being, so I would never, ever forget. “Cole.” Mom’s voice was barely a rasp. She took my wrists and squeezed them with the last of her lingering strength. \n\n“If you see a school bus,” her grip was suddenly harsh, emphasising each word slipping from her cracked lips. “I want you to run as far as you can, okay?” When I didn’t answer, confused, she leaned forward, her ice cold breath flittering in my face. “Run. Until you can’t run anymore. Can you do that for me, honey?” It was strange. Mom had barely spoken a word all day, and there she was speaking to me in full sentences. Dad told me it was possible there wouldn’t be a chance to talk to her again, but my mom was speaking in complete clarity.\n\n“Mommy?”  I remember reaching out to wrap my arms around her neck, but she caught my wrists again, her expression igniting to life. She never talked like this. Ever since mom got sick, all she did was sleep and stare out of the window with a faraway look on her face, like she was at peace with the inevitable. It was jarring seeing my mother like this. Like she was awake for the first time in a long time, awakening from a trance. I didn’t know what cancer was. I just knew it was a bad thing, and that it was making mom sick. \n\nBut I was never told which cancer it was, and what stage. I just watched it suck the life from her. In that flicker of a moment though, right before the snowfall stopped outside, white flakes dancing across the panes of the window, I realised my mom was going to die. And between that dying breath was one word which sent my younger self tumbling off of the bed, before a crowd of white figures bloomed into view, shoving me from the room.\n\n“Run.” Her eyes weren’t on me. She was looking past me, at something I couldn’t see, an oblivion only visible to her.\n\n“Run! Do you hear me? You need to run, Cole! Get out of here!”\n\nShe was screaming, then, her voice cutting into me, and I was paralysed, wanting to crawl towards the door, but I couldn’t move.\n\n“Go!”\n\nThose words never left my head—and neither did my mother’s voice screaming at me to run. Dad came into the room soon after and managed to calm me down, but it was too late. Mom had slipped away while I had been sitting on the waiting room floor sobbing into my knees, and trying to shake away her voice which hac crept its way into my skull. Nightmares followed. \n\nI dreamed of my mother becoming a big, scary monster, her sweet face morphing and twisting into something horrific, a three headed thing with razor sharp teeth. Every time a school bus passed, I tensed up, and I remember feeling like the world was coming apart around me. \n\nI couldn’t breathe, and I had to be told repeatedly that I was okay. But mom had died, leaving me with a fear which was eating me up inside. I didn’t even know why I was scared of them. Grandpappy asked me on the way home from kindergarten. He gently took my hands and asked me why I was scared. I told him I didn’t know, only that mom said that they were bad. I was quickly reassured that my mother had been on a lot of pain meds which made her say things she didn’t mean. I nodded and told them I understood, but I didn’t. \n\nBecause for the first time in what felt like forever, mom had actually looked at me. Spoke to me. Without slurring her words or getting distracted. Dad took me to therapy, but I was just told I was a child with an over-active imagination in grief. It did get better eventually. Before I knew it, I was eight years old. Four years since my mother’s death, and I only ever heard her voice when I was upset or alone. \n\nHer words were still deeply rooted inside of me, though I knew how to control my thoughts. I even got over my fear of school buses, after dad had practically dragged me onto on my first day of third grade and embarrassed me enough to suppress my fear. I don’t know what I expected. Maybe I expected the bus to grow sharp teeth and eat all of us. But that didn’t happen. It was just a normal bus—and I felt stupid for listening to my mom. Dad was right. I had an overactive imagination, and yellow school buses were nothing to be afraid of. My third grade teacher was called Mrs White, and on the very first day of third grade, she had told our class that we were special, before planting her face into a pie made of whipped cream, making us all laugh.\n\nThe boy in front of me laughed so hard, he snorted on a gummy worm he had been slyly chewing on. Mrs White was different to my other teachers. They talked about math and fractions, and boring stuff like that. Mrs White told us stories about her times traveling the world and sang songs to match each country. I loved her classes. \n\nI loved sitting at the very back and doing work in my workbook, watching Mrs White dance around the classroom, twirling around, and pulling kids from their chairs to dance with her. She made us do tests which weren’t math or English. Instead, we had to focus real hard to read what was written on a blank piece of paper. Initially, I couldn’t read it. None of us could no matter how hard we squinted and flipped the paper over, frowning at it from different angles. Mrs White reassured us we were close.\n\n“Practise means perfect!” She would always sing when kid’s started to cry with frustration. I will say it started to get painful. The girl sitting behind me, Pippa, started complaining that her head hurt. Followed by other kids. Though with the pain came clarity. One day, Pippa jumped up, raising her hand, her lips split with glee. “Mrs White!” She squealed, waving the paper in the air. It was several months into the school year, and every day we were expected to spend at least an hour trying to read the piece of paper. \n\nNone of them had even come close to being able to read a seemingly blank piece of paper, only getting headaches. \n\nNoah Carlisle got a nosebleed, and Mrs White gave him tissue paper to wipe his face, pushing him to break through the pain. Pippa wasn’t exactly the smartest in the class. She thought Canada was the capital of Australia. \n\nSo, we were all surprised when she jumped from her desk, swiping at her head. Twisting around in my chair to look at her, I could tell from the crinkle between her brows and the slight curl in Pippa’s lip that she was in pain. “I did it!” She squealed, attracting Mrs White’s attention.\n\n“Oh?” Mrs White’s eyes glittered, her smile widening. “What does it say, Pippa?”\n\nI hadn’t noticed how pale the girl was, until I was looking at her properly. Pippa was a redhead, so her skin complexion was practically pallid white, while her hair bounced in a ponytail. Her hand holding the piece of paper was trembling, but her smile only stretched right across her face. “It says,” Pippa cleared her throat dramatically to make sure everyone was listening, and that she was the centre of attention. I didn’t like Pippa. She pretended to be the smarty pants, despite knowing all her test answers were wrong. I couldn’t help feeling jealous of her.\n\n“It says….” Pippa dragged out the words, giggling.\n\n“She’s taking too long.” Jax Caine grumbled in front of me. When he caught my eye, the kid looked equally annoyed.\n\n“Yeah, I bet she’s lying.” Maddy McIntire spoke up loudly. If there was a third grade social hierarchy, Maddy was at the top. She stuck out her tongue at Pippa. “Can you tell us? We’re getting bored.” The girl mimed a yawn, and the rest of the class giggled. “Unless you’re lying, Pippa.”\n\nPippa’s eyes narrowed. “I’m not lying!”\n\n“Then tell us what it says!” Maddy’s lip curled. “You’re just pretending so you can be all dramatic. I know you’re lying.\"\n\n“Maddy, that’s enough.” Mrs White shot the girl a look, and Maddy backed down, turned around in her chair and huffed loudly. The teacher’s attention flicked back to Pippa. “Alright, what does it say? You can tell the whole class, sweetie. Don’t worry, they’ll be able to see it soon.”\n\nNodding, Pippa showed us the blank piece of paper. “It says we’re going on a field trip!”\n\nNow, that sparked excitement.\n\nWith the promise of a possible field trip if we all managed to see through the invisible paper, our class tried harder. There were more headaches, more nose bleeds and crying, before Jax jumped up from his chair one day, practically vibrating with glee. I think he was so excited he didn’t notice blood dripping down his chin. \n\nMrs White cleaned him up, and praised him, promising him and other kids that they could go on the field trip. Maddy was next. Of course she was. The girl was super dramatic, doing a twirl in her dress, claiming that she was the best because she didn’t suffer a headache or a nosebleed. I did, however, glimpse the girl shoving bloody tissue paper into the trash bin during recess. I started to notice a change in kid’s who had been granted permission for the fiend trip, and the rest of us who were still struggling. Pippa has grown unusually silent since announcing that she could read the paper. \n\nMrs White had given her extra work to do, though every time I slipped past her to go to the bathroom, I noticed the girl wasn’t even writing. Instead, her eyes were half lidded, her lips set into a dreamy smile. \n\nPippa could see something I couldn’t. Swallowing a thick paste which started to creep its way up my throat, her expression eerily reminded me of my mother’s. Needless to say though, I really didn’t want to be left out of the field trip. So, despite my classmates acting stranger than normal, I forced myself to break through the barrier Mrs White talked to us about at the start. When explaining what exactly the exercise was, our teacher told us that there was a barrier inside every brain. \n\nTo make this sound easier to understand, she did a theatrical re-enactment, making it extra goofy. Mrs White stood in front of a desk and pulled a face. “This.” She slapped the wooden top. “This is your brain, everyone!” When we all laughed,  she shoved a chair in front of the desk. \n\n“And this? This is the scary barrier which is stopping you from reaching your potential! But!” Her grin made me laugh harder. “What if we were to knock over the chair, hmm? That’s what I want you to do with your paper. I want you to visualise breaking the chair, so you can see the desk more clearly.”\n\n“Breaking the chair!” We all sang when our teacher jumped onto the desk and pumped her arms. “Breaking the chair!”\n\nSo, that’s what I did.\n\nOr… I tried to.  I was one of the last ones to break through the barrier. There were three of us left, and the field trip was looming. \n\nOne night, I asked dad if he could help me solve a problem. Mrs White told us not to tell our parents about the super fun games we were all playing, so I asked him how I could solve a particularly hard math sum—to which he had looked up from his laptop, and offered me a pensive smile over his coffee. “Try relaxing your mind, and think about something else,” dad told me. “And then, who knows? Maybe if you put less strain on yourself, it might come to you?” He did pull a face though. “Cole, what exactly was the math sum? I can give you the answer if you want?”\n\nShaking my head, I insisted I could do it myself. Then I did exactly what dad told me to do. I didn’t think about the blank piece of paper all night, and during normal classes, I pushed it out of my head. At recess, there was nobody to play with anymore. The kids who could read the message stayed in class, staring into thin air. \n\nSometimes, Mrs White brought people into class to talk to them. They weren’t teachers. I didn’t know who they were. All of them had scary faces and were my dad’s age. I watched them poke and prod my classmates, asking them questions like, “Are you able to see this?” While holding several blank pieces of coloured card. Jax, Maddy, and the others nodded their heads while Mrs White stood by with an odd look on her face. I had decided that day I would become like them. I wouldn’t be left out like the other two kids. \n\nSo, I slumped down at my desk, put my head down, and glared at the paper until a dull pain was blossoming behind my eyes, the lights above me suddenly far too bright. Blank. I stared harder. Blank. I gritted my teeth so hard I could taste rusty coins at the back of my mouth. Getting progressively more frustrated, I decided that I was going to pretend that I didn’t care. Just like when my PlayStation didn’t work, and I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the game to load. \n\nTrying the same tactic, I clenched my fists and mentally told the piece of paper I didn’t care. I was through caring, and the stupid thing could go away. Stubbornly, I sat with my arms folded, staring into the backs of my eyes, before deciding I had spent enough time ignoring the paper. Cracking one eye open, I expected to find the same blank piece of paper in front of me. However, this time the paper wasn’t blank. I was half aware of rivulets of sharp, startling red spotting white, but my eyes were glued to a sentence written in bold at the very top. “Mrs White’s Third Grade Class! You’re Going On A Field Trip!”\n\nDad was right. Ignoring my own blood staining the collar of my shirt, and pooling on my desk, my own lips split into a grin.\n\nIt was trying too hard, trying to force it, that was stopping me from breaking through. Once I told everyone I could see the paper, I was let into this secret group they were all part of. This time I knew what they were doing. Our teacher told us to focus on a blank piece of paper, just like the one we had already been tested on, and then try and visualise certain things in front of us. Blobs, to be exact. We were reassured that the field trip would elaborate on what Blobs were, so until then we had to practise. The first piece of paper I received was a teddy bear.\n\nThat was easy. I could visualise it perfectly, until I could reach out and touch its prickly fur. Then the images started to get blurry. So did the sessions. I remembered the start of them, but time seemed to pass by quickly, and before I knew it, I was sitting in the back of dad’s car, trying to remember what I had been doing all afternoon. But I was still happy I broke through the barrier. Mrs White reiterated that on the day of the field trip, when we were lining up to board a bright yellow school bus. I tried not to look at it. \n\nI had gotten over my fear, sure. But with it standing right in front of me, all bright and scary looking, and exactly what my mother had warned me of, I couldn’t resist ducking my head, hiding behind Maddy, who was jumping up and down, showing everyone her brand new lunchbox. “That is what I wanted you to do.” Mrs White told all of us with a smile. She was wearing an extravagant colour that day; a bright yellow dress which matched the bus. “All I wanted you to do was switch off your brain, which of course allowed you to break through that barrier.” Stepping aside, she allowed us to start jumping onto the bus. \n\nAfter hesitating, I made my way up the steps, squeezing the pole way too tightly. I noticed Mrs White wasn’t alone. There were three others with her, situated at the very front of the bus. I found a seat at the back, making myself comfortable by the window.\n\n The school bus wasn’t scary. That is what I told myself, over and over again, gripping my seat for dear life.\n\n“Seatbelts!” Mrs White shouted, cupping her mouth.\n\n“Where are we going?” I spoke up.\n\nThe teacher laughed. “Well, this is an educational field trip after all, so about we learn about the human body?”\n\nJax raised his hand. “How are we going to do that, Mrs White?” His eyes widened. “Are we going to a museum?”\n\n“No, I don’t want to go to the museum!” Maddy twisted around to glare at him. “I want to go to the zoo! Can we go to the zoo?”\n\nThe bus was unusually fast, which I immediately hated. The other kids, however, were squealing in delight. It wasn’t just going fast though. It was going so fast I felt like we were… flying. \n\nTurning to the window, my stomach twisted at the sight of white fluffy clouds and an expanse of blue sky. We were flying. All of the dread which had been eating me up inside turned to unbridled excitement which almost sent me off my chair. I joined in with the laughter and glee. Maddy turned around to me, her eyes wide with amazement, and I stuck out my tongue at her, giggling. We were flying—and not just that. The school bus was expanding and shrinking, allowing us to travel inside living animals, like horses and pigs. \n\n“Alright everyone!” Mrs White jumped up from her seat, waving her arms. Outside, the windows were a scary red colour, as we delved inside different animals. “Who wants to learn about the digestive system?” She winked. “But this time, it’s the human one.”\n\nShaking her head, the teacher chuckled. “No, I’ve got something even more exciting planned! Have you ever wondered what it’s like to delve into the human body, and see all the wiggly bits? All of your organs? Bones and blood, it’s all wonderful! Don’t you want to see it?”\n\n“Ewww!” Pippa giggled. “I don’t want to see all of the gross wiggly bits!”\n\n“Well,” Mrs White cleared her throat, “How about we talk about the digestive system? Hands up! Who’s hungry?”\n\n“Me!”\n\n“Me!”\n\nMrs White’s field trip’s became an everyday sort of thing. We learned everything, from the inhabitants of fish and mammals, to how the human digestive system works, by taking us inside unsuspecting people. Mrs White taught us about red and white blood cells, bacteria, and germs. She even showed us a germ. \n\nI could see it right outside the window, and Maddy screamed so loud everyone laughed. I loved every field trip, and anticipated where we would be going each time. I got used to the flying school bus. Instead of screaming, like my first few times, or just staring in shock, I threw up my hands like everyone else, singing songs with my classmates and Mrs White. It wasn’t until the new girl started when things started to get a little less clear. \n\nThe new girl was called Cassandra, and according to her, the field trip’s at her old school were tonnes batter than ours. She made sure she let out know every class, which got annoying. Cassandra didn’t believe us about our adventures, only folding her arms across her chest and snorting. “Well, at MY school, we went to Paris.” She said smugly. We knew she was lying, and neither of us wanted her to come along on our adventures. I did find it strange that Cassandra didn’t’ have to try and find the message on the blank piece of paper like the rest of us. \n\nMrs White eagerly welcomed her to join us on the bus, and I couldn’t resist feeling jealous that she got to come without breaking through the barrier. To my annoyance, Cassandra stalked onto the bus, pushing past Maddy and Jax, and slumping down in the seat next to me. “We had better looking school buses at my old school,” she said loudly, shooting me smile.\n\nJax pouted. “At my old school, we never shut up about my old school,” he mocked with a snort. \n\nNobody laughed, and the boy ducked his head, his cheeks going red. “Well, I thought it was funny.”\n\n“You’re not funny, Jax, and you never will be.” Maddy sang from the front of the bus.\n\n“At my old school—\"\n\nThe two of them cut Cassandra off before she could speak. “Were you this annoying at your old school?” Jax turned around to laugh at her, his eyes glinting.\n\nBuckling into my seatbelt, I nodded along with them. “You don’t have to come, you know—if you miss your school so much.”\n\nCassandra shrugged. “Well, I don’t want to miss out,” she said. “And besides, at my old school, we didn’t have a choice.”\n\nI snorted, and was ready with a comeback, before Mrs White came over, ducking in front of the girl. “Sweetie, can you move seats please?”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I would like you to.” The teacher’s voice was firm. “Come on, Cassie.”\n\n“I don’t like being called that.”\n\n“I will call you Cassandra if you move seats for me, okay? It’s not hard, sweetie.”\n\nMrs White ushered Cassandrea to a window seat opposite me. My gaze followed her, as she sighed dramatically, and dragged herself to her allocated space. I was frowning at Cassandra’s backpack, at a superhero I couldn’t figure out the name of, when I saw it. On the seat in front of the girl was a small Tv screen.\n\nI had never noticed it until right then—and once I had seen it, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. Cassandra looked equally confused. She pointed at the screen. “Mrs White, are we going to be watching TV? We weren’t allowed to at my old school.”\n\nFor a second, I caught an expression crossing my teacher’s face I had never seen before. I wasn’t sure what it was, but the energy seemed similar between the others she was with. They exchanged glances and spoke in hushed whispers before responding to the girl. “Uh, no, Cassandra,” Mrs White shook her head, maintaining a slightly strained smile. “No, we’re going to be going on an adventure! Are you excited?”\n\nThe girl’s eyes were sceptical, but she shrugged.\n\n“Fine.” She wrinkled her nose. “I want to see all of the crazy stuff you guys supposedly see.”\n\nWhen class began, and the school bus was catapulted into the air, all of us screaming in delight, giggling, most of us turning to see if Cassie was enjoying it—she wasn’t. In fact, she wasn’t even smiling. Her expression was blank, her wide eyes frowning at something. It wasn’t the mass of white blood cells flying past us, or the beating heart of the giraffe we had flown inside of. No, Cassie wasn’t reacting to anything. Her arms were folded across her chest, and she wasn’t moving. \n\nI ignored her at first. I thought she was just being annoying, and pretending she couldn’t see all the amazing things blossoming and coming to life in front of us. It was a whole new world, and Cassandra didn’t move once. When it was our turn to exit the bus, Mrs White gave us suits to make sure we were okay, and we could survive inside a human body. \n\nWe had delved right into the centre of a man called Peter. Mrs White explained he had a cold, and we were going to watch the process of his body fighting the evil virus, which she had called a Blob. \n\nOne by one, we jumped off the bus, and Cassandra followed us hesitantly, her eyes still wide and unseeing. She looked like she was going to cry, and I couldn’t resist poking her helmet teasingly. What I expected was for her to shoot me a glare or poke me back, but the girl didn’t even look at me. I don’t even think she noticed I was there.\n\nIt was so strange being inside a real human. When I reached out my hands, I envelope my hands in huge white blood cells beginning to attack the virus, or Blob. “Alright, everyone!” Mrs White stood at the front. “Now, do you all want to help the white blood cells fight the evil virus?”\n\n“Yes!” Maddy giggled.\n\n“Can we name it?” Jax shouted. “Let’s call it Bob!”\n\nOur teacher laughed along with us. “Okay, so I want you to do exactly what you did in the classroom, okay? When you broke through the barrier, I told you to visualise certain objects in front of you.” She cleared her throat. “Now, you’re going to destroy the blob with it.”\n\nI knew exactly what I was visualising. It came to me straight away, bleeding into my mind. I sketched it out in my head, something which was heavy and weighty in my hand, and that I could grasp on for. It was perfect for killing Blobs. Once I was imagining the object, I could feel it in my hands, sleek metal pressed into my skin. It felt right, and I knew exactly how to hold one. Looking around, everyone else did too.\n\n“When do we shoot, Mrs White?” Noah asked, pointing his object at the blob. With narrowed eyes, his finger played with the trigger.\n\n“Not yet.” Mrs White said, “I want you to wait until the Blob has decided to attack. Remember, by now Peter will be feeling the effects of the virus, and he will…”\n\nShe dragged out the word, and we all shouted, “Cough!”\n\n“Or sneeze!” She laughed, “It really depends! So, we’re going to wait for the perfect moment to attack the blob, and then we will be sneezed out!”\n\nNodding along, I focused all my attention on the blob. I got ready, squeezing the trigger excitedly, vibrating with excitement.\n\nBefore Cassandra let out a sharp cry, slicing through my concentration, and snapping me from my focus. When I turned to her, the girl’s eyes finally found mine, and she looked… scared. No. Terrified. In her hand was the object, and she was pointing at the blob—but her lips mouthed words I couldn’t understand. \n\nMrs White’s voice suddenly felt far away, and I found myself mesmerised by the girl’s words coming from her lips. She was bleeding. Badly. The sight of startling claret painting her face caused something in my mind to snap, and I felt my body jolt, like I had been electrocuted. Cassandra was still crying, but my surroundings were bleeding into nothing, from the thick red walls of Peter’s immune system, to tress and cloudy skies. So many trees. \n\nI recognised where we were automatically. It was the forest I used to go on walks with dad. Blinking rapidly, I was suddenly aware of something wet and sticky dripping from my nose, tainting my lips. I was standing in the exact same spot. I hadn’t moved. My classmates and Mrs White hadn’t moved. Though we weren’t inside the immune system of Peter, ready to shoot an evil blob. Cassandra’s words finally made sense, and I felt the heavy weight of something pressed into my hand.\n\n“What’s going on?”\n\nCassandra spoke so softly, I don’t think anyone heard her. The rest of my classmates were still speaking like in front of them was an evil virus.\n\n\"Do we shoot it now?” Jax, choking on blood, swung his gun at what I thought was a blob. Looking closer, however, reality snapping back into place, it was a man on his knees. He was sobbing into the ground. “Please.” He lifted his head, and I remember staggering back, the gun slipping from my grasp. He didn’t have time to finish his sentence, when the world was exploding around me, what felt like thunderbolts slamming into my skull. I dropped to my knees, watching the man slump down in a pool of blood, a perfect hole in the middle of his forehead.\n\n“I got it!”\n\nMaddy did a celebratory spin. “Mrs White, I killed the blob!”\n\n“No, WE killed the Blob.” Jax nudged her with his gun. “Hey, look!” He pointed at thin air. “It’s running away!”\n\n“You did, indeed!” Our teacher sounded proud, as men and women in white grabbed the body of the man, hauling it away. “Well done!”\n\n“I don’t understand what’s happening.”\n\nCassandra’s gun slipped from her grasp, but she was already being grabbed and dragged forward.\n\n“No!”\n\nShe kicked and screamed, and I couldn’t understand why the rest of them couldn’t hear her. “No, let me go! I want to go home!”\n\nNoah’s gaze snapped to her, and for a second I thought he was waking up. Instead though, he just laughed.\n\n“Did you fight viruses at your old school, Cassandra?”\n\nThe girl was hysterical. “What? But I… I don’t understand what’s happening! You killed someone!”\n\n“A virus!” Maddy sang.\n\n“Onwards, Cassandra!” Mrs White shouted, drowning out the girl’s screams so my unsuspecting classmates continued on in this bizarre trance which had them in an unrelenting vice grip. “We need to save Peter, remember? Do you want to go inside his brain this time?”\n\nThe others cheered, and I found myself taking slow steps back. I didn’t run. If I ran, I would be caught too.\n\nThey started to sing, marching into the trees, and once I was sure my teacher had turned her head, and the men and women tending to Cassandra couldn’t see me, I turned and forced myself into a sprint.\n\nI don’t remember falling. I remember my foot getting caught on a rock, though after that there was just the dark. I had vague memories of an oldish looking man looming over me, and the wet snout of a dog sniffing my neck and face, licking at blood staining my chin and face. When I woke, I was in hospital. Dad was next to me, and according to him, I had fallen during a field trip. I sat up, automatically spewing everything about Cassandra, and the gun’s, and the strange people with Mrs White. Dad’s expression crumpled, and he grasped my hand, telling me had hit my head and was having nightmares. \n\nThe next day, when I asked if my classmates were okay, he nodded, again shooting me a look of worry. I quickly understand what he meant, and how he was feeling, because when I walked into my third grade class a whole week later, with a bandage around my head, there was no sign of them. Pippa, Jax, and Maddy and Noah. Even Cassandra. They were all gone. Mrs White too. It was the same classroom and the same desks. \n\nI even saw the plastic horse Maddy kept under her desk to regularly remind everyone she liked pony’s. However, Maddy was gone. Her entire existence had been wiped away.  I tried to tell dad. I tried to tell the principal, naming all of them and demanding to see their parents. Except there weren’t any parents, or if there were, they didn’t remember their own children. After school one day, after driving myself crazy trying to figure out where the evil school bus had taken my classmates, and what it had done to them, I saw Pippa’s mom standing just outside the school gate.\n\nI already knew her name. Pippa’s mom made cookies for everyone when it was her daughter’s birthday.\n\n“Mrs Parka!” Ignoring my dad waiting for me, I hurried over to her. Immediately, she seemed to stumble back, blinking like I was an optical illusion.\n\n“I’m sorry, who are you?” She chuckled. But her expression was so impossibly sad, I couldn’t understand why her eyes were so empty, like she was waiting for someone. “I’m not supposed to be… here,” her hands were trembling by her sides. “I don’t even have a child, I just—”\n\n“Pippa.” I said. “You have a daughter, Mrs Parka.” When she shook her head, I grabbed and shook her. “Pippa! You have to remember her!”\n\n “Cole!”\n\nDad was at my side, grabbing my arm gently. “What are you doing?” He shot an apologetic look at Pippa’s mom. “I’m sorry about my son.”\n\nThe woman didn’t reply, only turning away and walking back down the sidewalk, a slight sway to her step.\n\nIt was official. My classmates had been spirited away by my evil teacher, and nobody believed me. It got to the point when dad tried to force more therapy on me, and I was told once again that I was still grieving my mother. And due to the aspects of the “dream” I was clearly still dwelling on her last words to me. I threw a cushion in the man’s face and stormed out. \n\nEventually, dad decided to move. Thank god. If I would have stayed in that town, knowing that a whole class of third graders had disappeared one day, completely wiped from everyone’s minds, I would have gone crazy. When I turned twelve, we moved to a quiet town where I started middle school and then high school. I refused to ride the bus to dad’s disdain, which meant he had to drive me to and from school, or I would walk forty minutes. \n\nThere was no way I was getting on another fucking school bus. In my senior year, a friend invited me to hang out atter school, and the second he hopped onto his school bus, my gut lurched into my throat. They all looked exactly the same. The exact same colour, and paint job, and the pattern on the seats. I hated them. \n\nBy the end of high school, I had managed to convince myself through smoking weed, a hell of  a lot of conversations with guys I hung with, and recreational drugs, that I had imagined it. \n\nFor college, I moved the city. In my freshman year, I stayed in student dorms, and then moved into a house with a bunch of friends from class. They were like a second family, and yes, they did know about the school bus hallucination. In fact, my housemates bought me the full DVD boxset of The Magic School Bus for my nineteenth. So yeah, thanks a lot guys.\n\nMy girlfriend didn’t help. She thought it was… cute.\n\nAnyway. Three nights ago, I was tired, and turned in pretty much as soon as I got home.\n\nBarely teetering on the edge of slumber, I was awakened by my housemate’s boyfriend shaking me.\n\n“Hey.” Ethan’s panicked voice brought me out of it. “Hey!”\n\nI sat up, swiping at my eyes. “What is it?” I frowned at the dark room, blinking. “Shit. What time is it?”\n\n“Cole.” Ethan grabbed my shoulders, and his grip was harsh. His eyes were almost comically wide, lips twisted. “You need to listen to me, okay? And you’re not going to freak out, because if you freak out, I am going to freak out, and I just want to know where Freddie is.”\n\nIt took me a second to take in his words.\n\n“What?” His words dragged me to my feet. “Ethan, what—”\n\n“There is a fucking flying school bus outside out window.” He said in a hiss. “And no, I am not making this shit up!”\n\nSomething ice cold crept down my spine, and I shook my head.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, that was all imaginary. I dreamed all of that, right? And even if the shit with the school bus was real, I was pretty sure my teacher had brainwashed my classmates into thinking the bus was flying—and that we were traveling deep into the body of a human being, or a mammal.\n\n“Freddie.”\n\nInstantly, my focus was on my housemates, while Ethan started jumping up and down, freaking the fuck out.\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“I don’t know! I came to see Freddie, and the door was open. I headed upstairs to check his room, I turn around…and there’s a FUCKING GIANT SCHOOL BUS FLYING OUTISDE HIS BEDROOM WINDOW.”\n\nMy body was already in fight or flight. “Stay here.” I told him. “Don’t move, okay?”\n\nEthan didn’t reply. After hesitating, I made my way into Freddie’s room, which had been trashed. Fuck. Stepping towards the window, I drew in a deep breath. It’s not real, I thought. It couldn’t be real. Ethan regularly took shrooms, so he was clearly tripping. As I forced myself towards the window, however, there was definitely something outside. I drew the curtains back, and there it was. As clear as day, my third grade school bus hovering in front of our house. My first reaction was to start yelling, only once my gaze had found it, a familiar fog came over my thoughts. \n\nI remember feeling it on that very first day of our field trip. I didn’t remember climbing onto Freddie’s open window. I couldn’t feel the breeze in my hair. It felt like flying. Ethan was behind me. I knew he was behind me, because he was trying and failing to grasp hold of my shirt to yank me back. I was stuck. Mesmerised by the sight. Cassandra, who was now my age, and yet still had the expression of a child.\n\nInstead of in its strict ponytail, her blonde hair hung loose on her shoulders. Her smile was empty, eyes vacant. Next to her, I saw other familiar faces. Now grown. Eighteen and nineteen year olds, kids who I thought had been dragged into oblivion. Cassandra was reaching out for me, and I almost fell for it. I almost let the dizzying fog take my mind once again. Thankfully, though, Ethan had managed to wrap his arms around my neck and drag me to my knees. I blinked, and the fog cleared away. Cassandra, however, wasn’t giving up.\n\nOnce I was on my feet, I twisted around to see the school bus had vanished out of existence.  \n\n“Where did it go?” Ethan hissed. “What the fuck is going on?”\n\nI caught him wrinkle his nose, swiping at his suddenly, and something inside me came apart.\n\n“Pepper.”\n\n“What?”\n\nEthan sniffled again.\n\n“Pepper!”\n\nI grabbed him, dragging down to the kitchen, yanking open cupboards, my breath in my throat. Thankfully, there was pepper in the cupboard. I poured some into my hand, pressing it over Ethan’s mouth. “You need to sneeze, okay?” I urged him. “Sneeze, or you’re going to die.”\n\nHis eyes widened. “What?”\n\nEthan’s gaze wandered behind, however, and he stumbled back, still swiping at his nose.\n\n“Cole, where have you been?”\n\nJax was standing in the doorway, his arms wrapped around Freddie’s neck, a gun firmly pressed into his temple. Freddie’s eyes were wild, but he wasn’t fighting back. Despite being a loose cannon, he was choosing to stay calm. I hated how I recognised the way Jax held the gun. I remembered knowing exactly how to hold it, how to finger the trigger, and find my attacker’s weak spot. In my head, it had been a blob. Until reality had split open, and I was in fact murdering human beings, who were being wiped from my mind, twisted into a whole other world my childish brain could comprehend. Cassandra was next to him, pouting. She swung her weapon playfully, before pointing it directly at Jax. “We looked for you.” She said. “Mrs White looked for you, but we couldn’t find you, and that made us really, really sad.”\n\n“Reallllyyyy saaaddddd.” Isssac nodded. He sounded exactly like when he was a kid, and the same expression on an eighteen year old guy looked wrong.\n\nWith words stuck in my throat, I couldn’t speak.\n\nCassandra stepped forward and handed me something.\n\nIt was a piece of paper. Old. Crumpled.\n\nI snatched it from her hand and found myself looking at what looked like some kind of contract.\n\n“I, _____ _______ give permission for my child _______ to become part of the MSB Foundation.\n\nAnd underneath, was a signature, followed by my mother’s name.\n\nMy knees buckled.\n\nThere was no way, I thought.\n\nBefore I could speak, Cassandra stepped back, and so did Jax, pulling Freddie along with them.\n\n“Why don’t you think about it, hmm?” Cassandra’s smile widened. “You can have a looonnnng think about it, and we can play with your friends while you’re thinking, okay?” She giggled. “Does that sound like fun?” She lifted a hand in a wave. “We’ve got them all, by the way!”\n\nWhen the two of them left, I was still staring at the crumpled piece of paper in my hand.\n\nMy mom. \n\nWillingly or not, she had signed me over to… to what? \n\nIt was much later, when Ethan was sleeping downstairs, and I was sitting in the kitchen trying to wake myself up, when my girlfriend swooped in, pulling me into a hug. “Cole, are you okay?” She asked, cradling my face. “You’re like, crazy pale. Do you want me to make you food?”\n\nI caught her nose twitch, and she chuckled. “I think I’m getting a cold. It just came on suddenly, like out of the—”\n\nI didn’t have enough time to stumble back or register what was happening—before a vivid explosion of crimson was coating my eyes, my face, my fucking cheeks. It painted me. I can still fucking feel it. My girlfriend covering me like paint. She was so warm, dripping from every piece of me. I’m not going to say my school bus exploded from her like in the fucking cartoons, because that shit isn’t real. But what I did, see, was her face expanding and bloating, like something was under her skin. I was standing in glistening, pooling red when I heard them.\n\nSomething whizzed past my face, like a fly. I wanted to swat it, but my body wouldn’t move.\n\n“Two days, Cole!”\n\nThey sang.\n\n“Or… we’ll play more games!”",

        "text": "I was five years old when my mother told me to stay away from school buses.\n\nSpecifically, yellow school buses.\n\nIt was on her death bed. Cancer. I didn’t really understand what was going on, except that my mom was going away for a while, and I wouldn’t be able to come with her. It was before Christmas, and snow was falling outside the window. I had jumped onto mom’s hospital bed, crawling over her frail body and situating myself next to her—ready to eagerly tell her about how excited I was about the snow, and that it meant that Santa was coming, when she grabbed my hand, and her grip had been firm enough to shatter my excitement. Dad had gone to get snacks, and grandpappy was asleep by the window. It was just mom and me. \n\nI remember trying to tug from her grasp because it hurt a little. I mean, it was enough to panic me. Mom never grabbed me like that—but when I looked into her eyes and caught her expression, a desperation and pain I wouldn’t yet understand, I stopped trying to pull away from her. Mom’s smile had been thin. I knew she was trying not to scare me, though at the same time making sure to plant the words into my head and taint them into my being, so I would never, ever forget. “Cole.” Mom’s voice was barely a rasp. She took my wrists and squeezed them with the last of her lingering strength. \n\n“If you see a school bus,” her grip was suddenly harsh, emphasising each word slipping from her cracked lips. “I want you to run as far as you can, okay?” When I didn’t answer, confused, she leaned forward, her ice cold breath flittering in my face. “Run. Until you can’t run anymore. Can you do that for me, honey?” It was strange. Mom had barely spoken a word all day, and there she was speaking to me in full sentences. Dad told me it was possible there wouldn’t be a chance to talk to her again, but my mom was speaking in complete clarity.\n\n“Mommy?”  I remember reaching out to wrap my arms around her neck, but she caught my wrists again, her expression igniting to life. She never talked like this. Ever since mom got sick, all she did was sleep and stare out of the window with a faraway look on her face, like she was at peace with the inevitable. It was jarring seeing my mother like this. Like she was awake for the first time in a long time, awakening from a trance. I didn’t know what cancer was. I just knew it was a bad thing, and that it was making mom sick. \n\nBut I was never told which cancer it was, and what stage. I just watched it suck the life from her. In that flicker of a moment though, right before the snowfall stopped outside, white flakes dancing across the panes of the window, I realised my mom was going to die. And between that dying breath was one word which sent my younger self tumbling off of the bed, before a crowd of white figures bloomed into view, shoving me from the room.\n\n“Run.” Her eyes weren’t on me. She was looking past me, at something I couldn’t see, an oblivion only visible to her.\n\n“Run! Do you hear me? You need to run, Cole! Get out of here!”\n\nShe was screaming, then, her voice cutting into me, and I was paralysed, wanting to crawl towards the door, but I couldn’t move.\n\n“Go!”\n\nThose words never left my head—and neither did my mother’s voice screaming at me to run. Dad came into the room soon after and managed to calm me down, but it was too late. Mom had slipped away while I had been sitting on the waiting room floor sobbing into my knees, and trying to shake away her voice which hac crept its way into my skull. Nightmares followed. \n\nI dreamed of my mother becoming a big, scary monster, her sweet face morphing and twisting into something horrific, a three headed thing with razor sharp teeth. Every time a school bus passed, I tensed up, and I remember feeling like the world was coming apart around me. \n\nI couldn’t breathe, and I had to be told repeatedly that I was okay. But mom had died, leaving me with a fear which was eating me up inside. I didn’t even know why I was scared of them. Grandpappy asked me on the way home from kindergarten. He gently took my hands and asked me why I was scared. I told him I didn’t know, only that mom said that they were bad. I was quickly reassured that my mother had been on a lot of pain meds which made her say things she didn’t mean. I nodded and told them I understood, but I didn’t. \n\nBecause for the first time in what felt like forever, mom had actually looked at me. Spoke to me. Without slurring her words or getting distracted. Dad took me to therapy, but I was just told I was a child with an over-active imagination in grief. It did get better eventually. Before I knew it, I was eight years old. Four years since my mother’s death, and I only ever heard her voice when I was upset or alone. \n\nHer words were still deeply rooted inside of me, though I knew how to control my thoughts. I even got over my fear of school buses, after dad had practically dragged me onto on my first day of third grade and embarrassed me enough to suppress my fear. I don’t know what I expected. Maybe I expected the bus to grow sharp teeth and eat all of us. But that didn’t happen. It was just a normal bus—and I felt stupid for listening to my mom. Dad was right. I had an overactive imagination, and yellow school buses were nothing to be afraid of. My third grade teacher was called Mrs White, and on the very first day of third grade, she had told our class that we were special, before planting her face into a pie made of whipped cream, making us all laugh.\n\nThe boy in front of me laughed so hard, he snorted on a gummy worm he had been slyly chewing on. Mrs White was different to my other teachers. They talked about math and fractions, and boring stuff like that. Mrs White told us stories about her times traveling the world and sang songs to match each country. I loved her classes. \n\nI loved sitting at the very back and doing work in my workbook, watching Mrs White dance around the classroom, twirling around, and pulling kids from their chairs to dance with her. She made us do tests which weren’t math or English. Instead, we had to focus real hard to read what was written on a blank piece of paper. Initially, I couldn’t read it. None of us could no matter how hard we squinted and flipped the paper over, frowning at it from different angles. Mrs White reassured us we were close.\n\n“Practise means perfect!” She would always sing when kid’s started to cry with frustration. I will say it started to get painful. The girl sitting behind me, Pippa, started complaining that her head hurt. Followed by other kids. Though with the pain came clarity. One day, Pippa jumped up, raising her hand, her lips split with glee. “Mrs White!” She squealed, waving the paper in the air. It was several months into the school year, and every day we were expected to spend at least an hour trying to read the piece of paper. \n\nNone of them had even come close to being able to read a seemingly blank piece of paper, only getting headaches. \n\nNoah Carlisle got a nosebleed, and Mrs White gave him tissue paper to wipe his face, pushing him to break through the pain. Pippa wasn’t exactly the smartest in the class. She thought Canada was the capital of Australia. \n\nSo, we were all surprised when she jumped from her desk, swiping at her head. Twisting around in my chair to look at her, I could tell from the crinkle between her brows and the slight curl in Pippa’s lip that she was in pain. “I did it!” She squealed, attracting Mrs White’s attention.\n\n“Oh?” Mrs White’s eyes glittered, her smile widening. “What does it say, Pippa?”\n\nI hadn’t noticed how pale the girl was, until I was looking at her properly. Pippa was a redhead, so her skin complexion was practically pallid white, while her hair bounced in a ponytail. Her hand holding the piece of paper was trembling, but her smile only stretched right across her face. “It says,” Pippa cleared her throat dramatically to make sure everyone was listening, and that she was the centre of attention. I didn’t like Pippa. She pretended to be the smarty pants, despite knowing all her test answers were wrong. I couldn’t help feeling jealous of her.\n\n“It says….” Pippa dragged out the words, giggling.\n\n“She’s taking too long.” Jax Caine grumbled in front of me. When he caught my eye, the kid looked equally annoyed.\n\n“Yeah, I bet she’s lying.” Maddy McIntire spoke up loudly. If there was a third grade social hierarchy, Maddy was at the top. She stuck out her tongue at Pippa. “Can you tell us? We’re getting bored.” The girl mimed a yawn, and the rest of the class giggled. “Unless you’re lying, Pippa.”\n\nPippa’s eyes narrowed. “I’m not lying!”\n\n“Then tell us what it says!” Maddy’s lip curled. “You’re just pretending so you can be all dramatic. I know you’re lying.\"\n\n“Maddy, that’s enough.” Mrs White shot the girl a look, and Maddy backed down, turned around in her chair and huffed loudly. The teacher’s attention flicked back to Pippa. “Alright, what does it say? You can tell the whole class, sweetie. Don’t worry, they’ll be able to see it soon.”\n\nNodding, Pippa showed us the blank piece of paper. “It says we’re going on a field trip!”\n\nNow, that sparked excitement.\n\nWith the promise of a possible field trip if we all managed to see through the invisible paper, our class tried harder. There were more headaches, more nose bleeds and crying, before Jax jumped up from his chair one day, practically vibrating with glee. I think he was so excited he didn’t notice blood dripping down his chin. \n\nMrs White cleaned him up, and praised him, promising him and other kids that they could go on the field trip. Maddy was next. Of course she was. The girl was super dramatic, doing a twirl in her dress, claiming that she was the best because she didn’t suffer a headache or a nosebleed. I did, however, glimpse the girl shoving bloody tissue paper into the trash bin during recess. I started to notice a change in kid’s who had been granted permission for the fiend trip, and the rest of us who were still struggling. Pippa has grown unusually silent since announcing that she could read the paper. \n\nMrs White had given her extra work to do, though every time I slipped past her to go to the bathroom, I noticed the girl wasn’t even writing. Instead, her eyes were half lidded, her lips set into a dreamy smile. \n\nPippa could see something I couldn’t. Swallowing a thick paste which started to creep its way up my throat, her expression eerily reminded me of my mother’s. Needless to say though, I really didn’t want to be left out of the field trip. So, despite my classmates acting stranger than normal, I forced myself to break through the barrier Mrs White talked to us about at the start. When explaining what exactly the exercise was, our teacher told us that there was a barrier inside every brain. \n\nTo make this sound easier to understand, she did a theatrical re-enactment, making it extra goofy. Mrs White stood in front of a desk and pulled a face. “This.” She slapped the wooden top. “This is your brain, everyone!” When we all laughed,  she shoved a chair in front of the desk. \n\n“And this? This is the scary barrier which is stopping you from reaching your potential! But!” Her grin made me laugh harder. “What if we were to knock over the chair, hmm? That’s what I want you to do with your paper. I want you to visualise breaking the chair, so you can see the desk more clearly.”\n\n“Breaking the chair!” We all sang when our teacher jumped onto the desk and pumped her arms. “Breaking the chair!”\n\nSo, that’s what I did.\n\nOr… I tried to.  I was one of the last ones to break through the barrier. There were three of us left, and the field trip was looming. \n\nOne night, I asked dad if he could help me solve a problem. Mrs White told us not to tell our parents about the super fun games we were all playing, so I asked him how I could solve a particularly hard math sum—to which he had looked up from his laptop, and offered me a pensive smile over his coffee. “Try relaxing your mind, and think about something else,” dad told me. “And then, who knows? Maybe if you put less strain on yourself, it might come to you?” He did pull a face though. “Cole, what exactly was the math sum? I can give you the answer if you want?”\n\nShaking my head, I insisted I could do it myself. Then I did exactly what dad told me to do. I didn’t think about the blank piece of paper all night, and during normal classes, I pushed it out of my head. At recess, there was nobody to play with anymore. The kids who could read the message stayed in class, staring into thin air. \n\nSometimes, Mrs White brought people into class to talk to them. They weren’t teachers. I didn’t know who they were. All of them had scary faces and were my dad’s age. I watched them poke and prod my classmates, asking them questions like, “Are you able to see this?” While holding several blank pieces of coloured card. Jax, Maddy, and the others nodded their heads while Mrs White stood by with an odd look on her face. I had decided that day I would become like them. I wouldn’t be left out like the other two kids. \n\nSo, I slumped down at my desk, put my head down, and glared at the paper until a dull pain was blossoming behind my eyes, the lights above me suddenly far too bright. Blank. I stared harder. Blank. I gritted my teeth so hard I could taste rusty coins at the back of my mouth. Getting progressively more frustrated, I decided that I was going to pretend that I didn’t care. Just like when my PlayStation didn’t work, and I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the game to load. \n\nTrying the same tactic, I clenched my fists and mentally told the piece of paper I didn’t care. I was through caring, and the stupid thing could go away. Stubbornly, I sat with my arms folded, staring into the backs of my eyes, before deciding I had spent enough time ignoring the paper. Cracking one eye open, I expected to find the same blank piece of paper in front of me. However, this time the paper wasn’t blank. I was half aware of rivulets of sharp, startling red spotting white, but my eyes were glued to a sentence written in bold at the very top. “Mrs White’s Third Grade Class! You’re Going On A Field Trip!”\n\nDad was right. Ignoring my own blood staining the collar of my shirt, and pooling on my desk, my own lips split into a grin.\n\nIt was trying too hard, trying to force it, that was stopping me from breaking through. Once I told everyone I could see the paper, I was let into this secret group they were all part of. This time I knew what they were doing. Our teacher told us to focus on a blank piece of paper, just like the one we had already been tested on, and then try and visualise certain things in front of us. Blobs, to be exact. We were reassured that the field trip would elaborate on what Blobs were, so until then we had to practise. The first piece of paper I received was a teddy bear.\n\nThat was easy. I could visualise it perfectly, until I could reach out and touch its prickly fur. Then the images started to get blurry. So did the sessions. I remembered the start of them, but time seemed to pass by quickly, and before I knew it, I was sitting in the back of dad’s car, trying to remember what I had been doing all afternoon. But I was still happy I broke through the barrier. Mrs White reiterated that on the day of the field trip, when we were lining up to board a bright yellow school bus. I tried not to look at it. \n\nI had gotten over my fear, sure. But with it standing right in front of me, all bright and scary looking, and exactly what my mother had warned me of, I couldn’t resist ducking my head, hiding behind Maddy, who was jumping up and down, showing everyone her brand new lunchbox. “That is what I wanted you to do.” Mrs White told all of us with a smile. She was wearing an extravagant colour that day; a bright yellow dress which matched the bus. “All I wanted you to do was switch off your brain, which of course allowed you to break through that barrier.” Stepping aside, she allowed us to start jumping onto the bus. \n\nAfter hesitating, I made my way up the steps, squeezing the pole way too tightly. I noticed Mrs White wasn’t alone. There were three others with her, situated at the very front of the bus. I found a seat at the back, making myself comfortable by the window.\n\n The school bus wasn’t scary. That is what I told myself, over and over again, gripping my seat for dear life.\n\n“Seatbelts!” Mrs White shouted, cupping her mouth.\n\n“Where are we going?” I spoke up.\n\nThe teacher laughed. “Well, this is an educational field trip after all, so about we learn about the human body?”\n\nJax raised his hand. “How are we going to do that, Mrs White?” His eyes widened. “Are we going to a museum?”\n\n“No, I don’t want to go to the museum!” Maddy twisted around to glare at him. “I want to go to the zoo! Can we go to the zoo?”\n\nThe bus was unusually fast, which I immediately hated. The other kids, however, were squealing in delight. It wasn’t just going fast though. It was going so fast I felt like we were… flying. \n\nTurning to the window, my stomach twisted at the sight of white fluffy clouds and an expanse of blue sky. We were flying. All of the dread which had been eating me up inside turned to unbridled excitement which almost sent me off my chair. I joined in with the laughter and glee. Maddy turned around to me, her eyes wide with amazement, and I stuck out my tongue at her, giggling. We were flying—and not just that. The school bus was expanding and shrinking, allowing us to travel inside living animals, like horses and pigs. \n\n“Alright everyone!” Mrs White jumped up from her seat, waving her arms. Outside, the windows were a scary red colour, as we delved inside different animals. “Who wants to learn about the digestive system?” She winked. “But this time, it’s the human one.”\n\nShaking her head, the teacher chuckled. “No, I’ve got something even more exciting planned! Have you ever wondered what it’s like to delve into the human body, and see all the wiggly bits? All of your organs? Bones and blood, it’s all wonderful! Don’t you want to see it?”\n\n“Ewww!” Pippa giggled. “I don’t want to see all of the gross wiggly bits!”\n\n“Well,” Mrs White cleared her throat, “How about we talk about the digestive system? Hands up! Who’s hungry?”\n\n“Me!”\n\n“Me!”\n\nMrs White’s field trip’s became an everyday sort of thing. We learned everything, from the inhabitants of fish and mammals, to how the human digestive system works, by taking us inside unsuspecting people. Mrs White taught us about red and white blood cells, bacteria, and germs. She even showed us a germ. \n\nI could see it right outside the window, and Maddy screamed so loud everyone laughed. I loved every field trip, and anticipated where we would be going each time. I got used to the flying school bus. Instead of screaming, like my first few times, or just staring in shock, I threw up my hands like everyone else, singing songs with my classmates and Mrs White. It wasn’t until the new girl started when things started to get a little less clear. \n\nThe new girl was called Cassandra, and according to her, the field trip’s at her old school were tonnes batter than ours. She made sure she let out know every class, which got annoying. Cassandra didn’t believe us about our adventures, only folding her arms across her chest and snorting. “Well, at MY school, we went to Paris.” She said smugly. We knew she was lying, and neither of us wanted her to come along on our adventures. I did find it strange that Cassandra didn’t’ have to try and find the message on the blank piece of paper like the rest of us. \n\nMrs White eagerly welcomed her to join us on the bus, and I couldn’t resist feeling jealous that she got to come without breaking through the barrier. To my annoyance, Cassandra stalked onto the bus, pushing past Maddy and Jax, and slumping down in the seat next to me. “We had better looking school buses at my old school,” she said loudly, shooting me smile.\n\nJax pouted. “At my old school, we never shut up about my old school,” he mocked with a snort. \n\nNobody laughed, and the boy ducked his head, his cheeks going red. “Well, I thought it was funny.”\n\n“You’re not funny, Jax, and you never will be.” Maddy sang from the front of the bus.\n\n“At my old school—\"\n\nThe two of them cut Cassandra off before she could speak. “Were you this annoying at your old school?” Jax turned around to laugh at her, his eyes glinting.\n\nBuckling into my seatbelt, I nodded along with them. “You don’t have to come, you know—if you miss your school so much.”\n\nCassandra shrugged. “Well, I don’t want to miss out,” she said. “And besides, at my old school, we didn’t have a choice.”\n\nI snorted, and was ready with a comeback, before Mrs White came over, ducking in front of the girl. “Sweetie, can you move seats please?”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I would like you to.” The teacher’s voice was firm. “Come on, Cassie.”\n\n“I don’t like being called that.”\n\n“I will call you Cassandra if you move seats for me, okay? It’s not hard, sweetie.”\n\nMrs White ushered Cassandrea to a window seat opposite me. My gaze followed her, as she sighed dramatically, and dragged herself to her allocated space. I was frowning at Cassandra’s backpack, at a superhero I couldn’t figure out the name of, when I saw it. On the seat in front of the girl was a small Tv screen.\n\nI had never noticed it until right then—and once I had seen it, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. Cassandra looked equally confused. She pointed at the screen. “Mrs White, are we going to be watching TV? We weren’t allowed to at my old school.”\n\nFor a second, I caught an expression crossing my teacher’s face I had never seen before. I wasn’t sure what it was, but the energy seemed similar between the others she was with. They exchanged glances and spoke in hushed whispers before responding to the girl. “Uh, no, Cassandra,” Mrs White shook her head, maintaining a slightly strained smile. “No, we’re going to be going on an adventure! Are you excited?”\n\nThe girl’s eyes were sceptical, but she shrugged.\n\n“Fine.” She wrinkled her nose. “I want to see all of the crazy stuff you guys supposedly see.”\n\nWhen class began, and the school bus was catapulted into the air, all of us screaming in delight, giggling, most of us turning to see if Cassie was enjoying it—she wasn’t. In fact, she wasn’t even smiling. Her expression was blank, her wide eyes frowning at something. It wasn’t the mass of white blood cells flying past us, or the beating heart of the giraffe we had flown inside of. No, Cassie wasn’t reacting to anything. Her arms were folded across her chest, and she wasn’t moving. \n\nI ignored her at first. I thought she was just being annoying, and pretending she couldn’t see all the amazing things blossoming and coming to life in front of us. It was a whole new world, and Cassandra didn’t move once. When it was our turn to exit the bus, Mrs White gave us suits to make sure we were okay, and we could survive inside a human body. \n\nWe had delved right into the centre of a man called Peter. Mrs White explained he had a cold, and we were going to watch the process of his body fighting the evil virus, which she had called a Blob. \n\nOne by one, we jumped off the bus, and Cassandra followed us hesitantly, her eyes still wide and unseeing. She looked like she was going to cry, and I couldn’t resist poking her helmet teasingly. What I expected was for her to shoot me a glare or poke me back, but the girl didn’t even look at me. I don’t even think she noticed I was there.\n\nIt was so strange being inside a real human. When I reached out my hands, I envelope my hands in huge white blood cells beginning to attack the virus, or Blob. “Alright, everyone!” Mrs White stood at the front. “Now, do you all want to help the white blood cells fight the evil virus?”\n\n“Yes!” Maddy giggled.\n\n“Can we name it?” Jax shouted. “Let’s call it Bob!”\n\nOur teacher laughed along with us. “Okay, so I want you to do exactly what you did in the classroom, okay? When you broke through the barrier, I told you to visualise certain objects in front of you.” She cleared her throat. “Now, you’re going to destroy the blob with it.”\n\nI knew exactly what I was visualising. It came to me straight away, bleeding into my mind. I sketched it out in my head, something which was heavy and weighty in my hand, and that I could grasp on for. It was perfect for killing Blobs. Once I was imagining the object, I could feel it in my hands, sleek metal pressed into my skin. It felt right, and I knew exactly how to hold one. Looking around, everyone else did too.\n\n“When do we shoot, Mrs White?” Noah asked, pointing his object at the blob. With narrowed eyes, his finger played with the trigger.\n\n“Not yet.” Mrs White said, “I want you to wait until the Blob has decided to attack. Remember, by now Peter will be feeling the effects of the virus, and he will…”\n\nShe dragged out the word, and we all shouted, “Cough!”\n\n“Or sneeze!” She laughed, “It really depends! So, we’re going to wait for the perfect moment to attack the blob, and then we will be sneezed out!”\n\nNodding along, I focused all my attention on the blob. I got ready, squeezing the trigger excitedly, vibrating with excitement.\n\nBefore Cassandra let out a sharp cry, slicing through my concentration, and snapping me from my focus. When I turned to her, the girl’s eyes finally found mine, and she looked… scared. No. Terrified. In her hand was the object, and she was pointing at the blob—but her lips mouthed words I couldn’t understand. \n\nMrs White’s voice suddenly felt far away, and I found myself mesmerised by the girl’s words coming from her lips. She was bleeding. Badly. The sight of startling claret painting her face caused something in my mind to snap, and I felt my body jolt, like I had been electrocuted. Cassandra was still crying, but my surroundings were bleeding into nothing, from the thick red walls of Peter’s immune system, to tress and cloudy skies. So many trees. \n\nI recognised where we were automatically. It was the forest I used to go on walks with dad. Blinking rapidly, I was suddenly aware of something wet and sticky dripping from my nose, tainting my lips. I was standing in the exact same spot. I hadn’t moved. My classmates and Mrs White hadn’t moved. Though we weren’t inside the immune system of Peter, ready to shoot an evil blob. Cassandra’s words finally made sense, and I felt the heavy weight of something pressed into my hand.\n\n“What’s going on?”\n\nCassandra spoke so softly, I don’t think anyone heard her. The rest of my classmates were still speaking like in front of them was an evil virus.\n\n\"Do we shoot it now?” Jax, choking on blood, swung his gun at what I thought was a blob. Looking closer, however, reality snapping back into place, it was a man on his knees. He was sobbing into the ground. “Please.” He lifted his head, and I remember staggering back, the gun slipping from my grasp. He didn’t have time to finish his sentence, when the world was exploding around me, what felt like thunderbolts slamming into my skull. I dropped to my knees, watching the man slump down in a pool of blood, a perfect hole in the middle of his forehead.\n\n“I got it!”\n\nMaddy did a celebratory spin. “Mrs White, I killed the blob!”\n\n“No, WE killed the Blob.” Jax nudged her with his gun. “Hey, look!” He pointed at thin air. “It’s running away!”\n\n“You did, indeed!” Our teacher sounded proud, as men and women in white grabbed the body of the man, hauling it away. “Well done!”\n\n“I don’t understand what’s happening.”\n\nCassandra’s gun slipped from her grasp, but she was already being grabbed and dragged forward.\n\n“No!”\n\nShe kicked and screamed, and I couldn’t understand why the rest of them couldn’t hear her. “No, let me go! I want to go home!”\n\nNoah’s gaze snapped to her, and for a second I thought he was waking up. Instead though, he just laughed.\n\n“Did you fight viruses at your old school, Cassandra?”\n\nThe girl was hysterical. “What? But I… I don’t understand what’s happening! You killed someone!”\n\n“A virus!” Maddy sang.\n\n“Onwards, Cassandra!” Mrs White shouted, drowning out the girl’s screams so my unsuspecting classmates continued on in this bizarre trance which had them in an unrelenting vice grip. “We need to save Peter, remember? Do you want to go inside his brain this time?”\n\nThe others cheered, and I found myself taking slow steps back. I didn’t run. If I ran, I would be caught too.\n\nThey started to sing, marching into the trees, and once I was sure my teacher had turned her head, and the men and women tending to Cassandra couldn’t see me, I turned and forced myself into a sprint.\n\nI don’t remember falling. I remember my foot getting caught on a rock, though after that there was just the dark. I had vague memories of an oldish looking man looming over me, and the wet snout of a dog sniffing my neck and face, licking at blood staining my chin and face. When I woke, I was in hospital. Dad was next to me, and according to him, I had fallen during a field trip. I sat up, automatically spewing everything about Cassandra, and the gun’s, and the strange people with Mrs White. Dad’s expression crumpled, and he grasped my hand, telling me had hit my head and was having nightmares. \n\nThe next day, when I asked if my classmates were okay, he nodded, again shooting me a look of worry. I quickly understand what he meant, and how he was feeling, because when I walked into my third grade class a whole week later, with a bandage around my head, there was no sign of them. Pippa, Jax, and Maddy and Noah. Even Cassandra. They were all gone. Mrs White too. It was the same classroom and the same desks. \n\nI even saw the plastic horse Maddy kept under her desk to regularly remind everyone she liked pony’s. However, Maddy was gone. Her entire existence had been wiped away.  I tried to tell dad. I tried to tell the principal, naming all of them and demanding to see their parents. Except there weren’t any parents, or if there were, they didn’t remember their own children. After school one day, after driving myself crazy trying to figure out where the evil school bus had taken my classmates, and what it had done to them, I saw Pippa’s mom standing just outside the school gate.\n\nI already knew her name. Pippa’s mom made cookies for everyone when it was her daughter’s birthday.\n\n“Mrs Parka!” Ignoring my dad waiting for me, I hurried over to her. Immediately, she seemed to stumble back, blinking like I was an optical illusion.\n\n“I’m sorry, who are you?” She chuckled. But her expression was so impossibly sad, I couldn’t understand why her eyes were so empty, like she was waiting for someone. “I’m not supposed to be… here,” her hands were trembling by her sides. “I don’t even have a child, I just—”\n\n“Pippa.” I said. “You have a daughter, Mrs Parka.” When she shook her head, I grabbed and shook her. “Pippa! You have to remember her!”\n\n “Cole!”\n\nDad was at my side, grabbing my arm gently. “What are you doing?” He shot an apologetic look at Pippa’s mom. “I’m sorry about my son.”\n\nThe woman didn’t reply, only turning away and walking back down the sidewalk, a slight sway to her step.\n\nIt was official. My classmates had been spirited away by my evil teacher, and nobody believed me. It got to the point when dad tried to force more therapy on me, and I was told once again that I was still grieving my mother. And due to the aspects of the “dream” I was clearly still dwelling on her last words to me. I threw a cushion in the man’s face and stormed out. \n\nEventually, dad decided to move. Thank god. If I would have stayed in that town, knowing that a whole class of third graders had disappeared one day, completely wiped from everyone’s minds, I would have gone crazy. When I turned twelve, we moved to a quiet town where I started middle school and then high school. I refused to ride the bus to dad’s disdain, which meant he had to drive me to and from school, or I would walk forty minutes. \n\nThere was no way I was getting on another fucking school bus. In my senior year, a friend invited me to hang out atter school, and the second he hopped onto his school bus, my gut lurched into my throat. They all looked exactly the same. The exact same colour, and paint job, and the pattern on the seats. I hated them. \n\nBy the end of high school, I had managed to convince myself through smoking weed, a hell of  a lot of conversations with guys I hung with, and recreational drugs, that I had imagined it. \n\nFor college, I moved the city. In my freshman year, I stayed in student dorms, and then moved into a house with a bunch of friends from class. They were like a second family, and yes, they did know about the school bus hallucination. In fact, my housemates bought me the full DVD boxset of The Magic School Bus for my nineteenth. So yeah, thanks a lot guys.\n\nMy girlfriend didn’t help. She thought it was… cute.\n\nAnyway. Three nights ago, I was tired, and turned in pretty much as soon as I got home.\n\nBarely teetering on the edge of slumber, I was awakened by my housemate’s boyfriend shaking me.\n\n“Hey.” Ethan’s panicked voice brought me out of it. “Hey!”\n\nI sat up, swiping at my eyes. “What is it?” I frowned at the dark room, blinking. “Shit. What time is it?”\n\n“Cole.” Ethan grabbed my shoulders, and his grip was harsh. His eyes were almost comically wide, lips twisted. “You need to listen to me, okay? And you’re not going to freak out, because if you freak out, I am going to freak out, and I just want to know where Freddie is.”\n\nIt took me a second to take in his words.\n\n“What?” His words dragged me to my feet. “Ethan, what—”\n\n“There is a fucking flying school bus outside out window.” He said in a hiss. “And no, I am not making this shit up!”\n\nSomething ice cold crept down my spine, and I shook my head.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, that was all imaginary. I dreamed all of that, right? And even if the shit with the school bus was real, I was pretty sure my teacher had brainwashed my classmates into thinking the bus was flying—and that we were traveling deep into the body of a human being, or a mammal.\n\n“Freddie.”\n\nInstantly, my focus was on my housemates, while Ethan started jumping up and down, freaking the fuck out.\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“I don’t know! I came to see Freddie, and the door was open. I headed upstairs to check his room, I turn around…and there’s a FUCKING GIANT SCHOOL BUS FLYING OUTISDE HIS BEDROOM WINDOW.”\n\nMy body was already in fight or flight. “Stay here.” I told him. “Don’t move, okay?”\n\nEthan didn’t reply. After hesitating, I made my way into Freddie’s room, which had been trashed. Fuck. Stepping towards the window, I drew in a deep breath. It’s not real, I thought. It couldn’t be real. Ethan regularly took shrooms, so he was clearly tripping. As I forced myself towards the window, however, there was definitely something outside. I drew the curtains back, and there it was. As clear as day, my third grade school bus hovering in front of our house. My first reaction was to start yelling, only once my gaze had found it, a familiar fog came over my thoughts. \n\nI remember feeling it on that very first day of our field trip. I didn’t remember climbing onto Freddie’s open window. I couldn’t feel the breeze in my hair. It felt like flying. Ethan was behind me. I knew he was behind me, because he was trying and failing to grasp hold of my shirt to yank me back. I was stuck. Mesmerised by the sight. Cassandra, who was now my age, and yet still had the expression of a child.\n\nInstead of in its strict ponytail, her blonde hair hung loose on her shoulders. Her smile was empty, eyes vacant. Next to her, I saw other familiar faces. Now grown. Eighteen and nineteen year olds, kids who I thought had been dragged into oblivion. Cassandra was reaching out for me, and I almost fell for it. I almost let the dizzying fog take my mind once again. Thankfully, though, Ethan had managed to wrap his arms around my neck and drag me to my knees. I blinked, and the fog cleared away. Cassandra, however, wasn’t giving up.\n\nOnce I was on my feet, I twisted around to see the school bus had vanished out of existence.  \n\n“Where did it go?” Ethan hissed. “What the fuck is going on?”\n\nI caught him wrinkle his nose, swiping at his suddenly, and something inside me came apart.\n\n“Pepper.”\n\n“What?”\n\nEthan sniffled again.\n\n“Pepper!”\n\nI grabbed him, dragging down to the kitchen, yanking open cupboards, my breath in my throat. Thankfully, there was pepper in the cupboard. I poured some into my hand, pressing it over Ethan’s mouth. “You need to sneeze, okay?” I urged him. “Sneeze, or you’re going to die.”\n\nHis eyes widened. “What?”\n\nEthan’s gaze wandered behind, however, and he stumbled back, still swiping at his nose.\n\n“Cole, where have you been?”\n\nJax was standing in the doorway, his arms wrapped around Freddie’s neck, a gun firmly pressed into his temple. Freddie’s eyes were wild, but he wasn’t fighting back. Despite being a loose cannon, he was choosing to stay calm. I hated how I recognised the way Jax held the gun. I remembered knowing exactly how to hold it, how to finger the trigger, and find my attacker’s weak spot. In my head, it had been a blob. Until reality had split open, and I was in fact murdering human beings, who were being wiped from my mind, twisted into a whole other world my childish brain could comprehend. Cassandra was next to him, pouting. She swung her weapon playfully, before pointing it directly at Jax. “We looked for you.” She said. “Mrs White looked for you, but we couldn’t find you, and that made us really, really sad.”\n\n“Reallllyyyy saaaddddd.” Isssac nodded. He sounded exactly like when he was a kid, and the same expression on an eighteen year old guy looked wrong.\n\nWith words stuck in my throat, I couldn’t speak.\n\nCassandra stepped forward and handed me something.\n\nIt was a piece of paper. Old. Crumpled.\n\nI snatched it from her hand and found myself looking at what looked like some kind of contract.\n\n“I, _____ _______ give permission for my child _______ to become part of the MSB Foundation.\n\nAnd underneath, was a signature, followed by my mother’s name.\n\nMy knees buckled.\n\nThere was no way, I thought.\n\nBefore I could speak, Cassandra stepped back, and so did Jax, pulling Freddie along with them.\n\n“Why don’t you think about it, hmm?” Cassandra’s smile widened. “You can have a looonnnng think about it, and we can play with your friends while you’re thinking, okay?” She giggled. “Does that sound like fun?” She lifted a hand in a wave. “We’ve got them all, by the way!”\n\nWhen the two of them left, I was still staring at the crumpled piece of paper in my hand.\n\nMy mom. \n\nWillingly or not, she had signed me over to… to what? \n\nIt was much later, when Ethan was sleeping downstairs, and I was sitting in the kitchen trying to wake myself up, when my girlfriend swooped in, pulling me into a hug. “Cole, are you okay?” She asked, cradling my face. “You’re like, crazy pale. Do you want me to make you food?”\n\nI caught her nose twitch, and she chuckled. “I think I’m getting a cold. It just came on suddenly, like out of the—”\n\nI didn’t have enough time to stumble back or register what was happening—before a vivid explosion of crimson was coating my eyes, my face, my fucking cheeks. It painted me. I can still fucking feel it. My girlfriend covering me like paint. She was so warm, dripping from every piece of me. I’m not going to say my school bus exploded from her like in the fucking cartoons, because that shit isn’t real. But what I did, see, was her face expanding and bloating, like something was under her skin. I was standing in glistening, pooling red when I heard them.\n\nSomething whizzed past my face, like a fly. I wanted to swat it, but my body wouldn’t move.\n\n“Two days, Cole!”\n\nThey sang.\n\n“Or… we’ll play more games!”",

        "text": "\nThe winter this year has turned out to be extraordinarily snowless and frosty, the wind gusts going through even the sturdiest winter clothes. The smartest thing you can do in such a weather is not to leave the house and I have done just that. With a bottle of cognac and a bar of dark chocolate I nestled myself in front of the PC.\n\nThey say that drinking alone is the first sign of impending alcoholism. Let me assure you, it's a lie. You can't stay sober all the time, unless you are a masochist. Sometimes you have to soften your consciousness to calmly recall the past and think  about the future. Loud crowds aren't suitable for this, nobody will leave you alone with your thoughts there. Memories and thoughts require three things: cognac, loneliness and melancholy.\n\nThe speakerphone rudely interrupted my enjoyment of those. My steps already wobbly from several glasses of cognac I staggered into my hallway. The nightly visitor couldn't have picked a worse time to come around.\n\nPressing the button on the speaker I barked:\n\"What do you need?\"\n\n\"Please, sweetheart, let me in to get warm\"- a gentle voice of an elderly man responded. There was something warm in that voice, something that tender and familiar that for a moment I thought I am talking to my own grandfather.\n\n\"Are you visiting someone?\" - I asked, trying to appear more polite.\n\n\"Sweetheart, let me in to get warm\"- replied the same gentle voice of an old man.\n\nI turned on my ring camera. In front of the door stood an elder man, wearing a dirty scarf and an old jacket. The scarf used to be white once but now was blotched with dirt stuck to it. His cap was a few sizes too small, the kind teenagers wear. He looked so helpless, cold and certain to freeze to death if I wouldn't let him into the hallway. My imagination gladly painted a picture of our groundskeeper finding his frozen body next day, bystanders gathering around him and me, leaving the house, looking at the corpse of an unlucky elderly man, forgotten by all, a man I could have saved if I only would have let him into the hallway.\n\n\"Please sweetheart, let me in to get warm\" the tender, familiar voice spoke once again.\n\nWithout hesitation I pressed the button to open the door.\n\nMy desire for drink was gone entirely. After looking around the kitchen for 20 minutes I finally found my coffee jar. It was sitting right in front of me. Of course. Where else would the item be that you search for? Turning on the gas stove to maximum I was about to pour water into the kettle when my doorbell rang.\n\n\"I am so popular tonight\" I sighed to myself.\n\nLooking through the spy I saw the elder man I let into the house.\n\n\"Please sweetheart, let me in to get warm\" he spoke in a most tender, sweet and familiar voice. The voice of the person closest to me, in the entire world. My imagination already was producing pictures of me finding his stiff body as I was leaving for the store tomorrow,the poor old man, frozen to death right before my door. A man I could have saved if I wasn't such a bitch and just would have let him into the flat. A wave of regret washed over me, tears spilled from my eyes.\n\nTurning the door knob I was sure I was opening the door for my grandfather whose body I would undoubtedly find before my door if I wouldn't let her in right NOW.\n\nAnd yet my hand froze midway and a vague bad feeling rose in my soul, a feeling my alcohol - addled mind needed time to comprehend. Something was absolutely wrong. Locking the door again I stumbled backwards, away from the door. Reality came back to me. I remembered my grandfather dying when I was 11. I was about to let a strange man into my apartment.\n\n\"Let me in to get warm, sweetheart\" the tender and familiar voice repeated. But now I felt nothing but rising concern.\n\nStill unsure whether to open the door or get away from it , I stood there for 15 minutes. Meanwhile the pleas to be let in just kept repeating. The voice stayed tender which scared me even more. No human can stand in front of the door for 15 minutes and ask to be let in without changing their tone or showing irritation. That just doesn't happen.\n\nBeing 100% sure I would never open the door to the old man I decided to peek through the spy. Worn boots, an old jacket and a scarf with dirt stuck to it. Only now, there was an elongated snout above the scarf, much like a fox with red eyes and a row of sharp teeth.\n\n\"Please sweetheart, let me in to get warm\" I heard in my mind again. The jaws of the snout didn't move but just showed the row of teeth. As if it knew I am looking at it.\n\n\"Fuck off!\" I screamed, unable to tear myself away from the spy. The thing growled and started hitting my door with it's big paws.\n\nDespite the loud growling and the blows to my door I heard the croaking of an ancient elevator coming to our floor. Three people live on my floor: myself, Steph and a young lean brunette man who just recently moved to town. How to describe him? He was beautiful. Of course there were thousands and thousands of pretty young men around but he was special. The world seemed brighter and warmer with him around.\n\nThe elevator stopped. I heard the doors opening.\n\n\"Holy fuck! What the hell is this shit?!\" I heard a hoarse voice.\n\nI am sure that even lean men swear and might even have hoarse voices but I couldn't fail to recognise Steph's distinct manners.\n\nSteph was 62, she was small and had a pleasant character. Everyone seemed to like her. In all the 7 years I lived here I have never seen her fully sober. Oh, she wasn't your average alcoholic. She always looked neat, did the odd jobs here and there and no one had ever seen her lying shitfaced in a ditch. But she drank, drank every day, starting in the morning, as if she was following some to me unknown commandments of an alcohol god. I once asked her why she drinks. She told me that she has been drinking a little but every day for 11 years, starting with the death of her husband. I was touched and was about to express all the sympathy I could to the woman. But Steph quickly added: \" you know, I think the man is the first and last creation of Satan. He will eat your heart, drink your blood and suck your brain out through a straw. Who knows how long you will be drinking, trying to get rid of memories of him?\" While I stared her, baffled and trying to think of a response she quickly opened the door to the apartment and went in.\n\nThe beast slowly turned towards Steph, savouring our feat. Steph, why the hell did you have to come home now? I think if the lean young man would have stepped out, 70% of the women would try and save him , ending up in the belly of the beast. I don't know if it's good or bad or plain idiocy but that is how we were raised by books and movies. But who will risk their life for an alcoholic, even a friendly one? Certainly not me. The beast was poised to jump, standing before my door.\n\nSomewhere I heard that decisions you make in the heat of the moment, without thinking, turn out to be the best. That is utter bullshit. I don't know what came over me but I quickly unlocked my metallic door and slammed it against the beast, making it drop to it's knees.\n\n\"Steph, run!\" I screamed.\n\nSteph didn't need to be asked twice. Released from her stupor she leaped towards her door and immediately unlocked it, disappearing behind it in the next moment. That was insane to watch. I never thought she could be that fast. Usually it took her 10 minutes to find the right key and unlock the door.\n\nWhile I was watching Steph the beast got up and lounged towards me. Jumping back into my apartment I wasn't able to lock the door again. I ran for the kitchen , locking the door behind me. The beast was after me. It only took it two hits to demolish my kitchen door. Baring it's teeth, the beast stepped into my kitchen. There was nowhere to run.\n\nI grabbed a knife and hid myself in the corner across the stove while the beast kept approaching. It stared mockingly into the knife in my hand. It knew it wouldn't help me.\n\nA swipe of it's paw sent the knife scattering over the floor, me now clutching my bleeding fingers. It's breath stank like an open grave as it came near my throat. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to remember something sweet and dear to me, something you are supposed to think of before death.\n\nA shot. My ears started ringing.  Slowly I opened my eyes. The beast was standing before me, with a whole in it's belly. And Steph with a gun in the kitchen entrance. \n\nAnother shot sent the beast onto the burning stove, it's cheap jacket and scarf immediately catching fire. With loud screeches it started running around my kitchen. Steph broke the window glass with the butt of her gun and with two point blank shots she sent the abomination into free fall from the 11th floor.\n\n\"You warm yet?\" I asked, absolutely shocked, watching the beast fall down.\n\n2 hours later, finishing the open cognac bottle at Steph's place I slowly started coming to myself.\n\n\"Look , ehr..sorry for the window\" Steph mumbled.\n\n\"Steph, are you for real? If not for you I wouldn't be here! You're like, some kind of Van Helsing!\".\n\n\" Oh, what do you know. When I was in the village with my dead hub..he had such demons amongst his friends, you wouldn't believe it. Even now my blood runs cold thinking of it\".\n\nI downed my glass in two gulps\"And uh, you weren't even a little bit scared?\"\n\n\" What am I supposed to be scared of? I was married to Satan's step - brother for 30 years\".",

        "text": " I live in a small village in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by dense forests on all sides. I've always enjoyed the peace and quiet that comes with living in a place like this, but lately things have been... strange. It started about a month ago when the power went out.\n\nIt was a clear, sunny day, with not a cloud in the sky. I was sitting in my living room, watching TV, when everything suddenly went dark. At first, I thought it was just a temporary outage, it was not out of the normal in my country to have long bouts of loadshedding so I was just chilling at my home waiting for the power to come back, but as the hours ticked by, it became clear that something was seriously wrong.\n\nI tried to call the electricity supply board's customer care, but my phone was dead too, more like hanged to be precise. I picked the phone to dial but the screen was frozen and unresponsive, and then the screen brightness kept increasing until it was very bright, I tried to turn it off but it wouldn't and I really started to miss my old phones with removable battery. \n\nAnyway, the phone stayed like that for a few minutes and then it went completely dead. So, I did what any rational person would do: I grabbed a flashlight and headed outside to see what was going on. The first thing I noticed was how quiet everything was. No birds chirping, no wind rustling the leaves, nothing. It was as if the entire world had suddenly gone still.\n\nAs I made my way through the village, I noticed that nobody else was around. The streets were empty, the houses dark. It was like everyone had vanished into thin air. And then I heard it: a faint, muffled sound, coming from the direction of the forest.\n\nI hesitated for a moment, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I started making my way towards the sound. As I got closer, it became clear that it was some kind of mantra chanting. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but it was rhythmic and almost hypnotic.\n\nThe chanting seemed to be coming from a clearing in the forest, so I pushed my way through the undergrowth to get a better look. What I saw there will haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\nIn the center of the clearing was a group of people, all dressed in black robes, chanting around a bonfire lit before a human sized statue of what looked like Kali, the goddess of death, destruction, time and space. The contours of the idol gleaming with the orangish hue of the fire.\n\nIn the flickering light, I could see that their faces laden with the ashes of the ghats and were twisted into grotesque masks, with eyes that seemed to glow in the darkness. And then, one of them turned and looked right at me.\n\nI froze, terrified, as the chanting abruptly stopped. The figure started walking towards me, its eyes fixed on mine. At the same time the distance between it and me isn't decreasing I turned to run, but my feet wouldn't move. It was like something was holding me in place. The next thing I know I feel like the ground beneath me feels like it's wobbling and waving like water.\n\nI started to feel like I was losing my sense of balance and this weird sensation come over me as the mantra chanting grew louder and engulfed me, smothering my consciousness. I started feeling vertigo and the world around me started spinning and I lost my footing and fell on all my four.\n\nI lifted my head up, terrified, to check whether it was still coming towards me. It was. Yet the distance is not decreasing. Then I started falling and sliding along the ground that was as flat as a tennis court like I was rolling off the side of a very steep hill. But I'm not getting near to them either, it's like I was falling in the same place for a long time. All this while the ground continued to sway up and down. \n\nThen the plants and trees around me started appearing to be rearranging themselves like a moving maze. Then the figure stopped running towards me abruptly. The ground between us started to feel like shrinking. \n\nThe figure was getting closer and closer, until I could see its face clearly. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before - twisted, distorted, almost inhuman. And then, just as it was about to reach me, everything went black again.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was lying in my bed, with no memory of how I got there. The power was back on, the phone seemed to be working again and the world was moving again. I never wanted anything more than all of it being a bad dream. But I knew that something had changed. That night, I had stumbled upon something dark and terrifying, something that I was never meant to see.\n\nAs the days went by, I started to notice strange things happening around me. I would hear whispering voices coming from the shadows, see flickering lights in the corner of my eye. And every time I closed my eyes, I could see the twisted faces of the tantrics, chanting their mantras that sounded like muddled voices. Constantly haunted by the hum of those hymns.\n\nBut the worst part was the feeling of being watched. Every time I was alone, I could feel their eyes on me, watching my every move. I would often feel their breath on the back of my neck. \n\nOne day, I was preparing lunch at home and when I was reaching for the sambar masala powder, I suddenly felt a faint whisper in my ear, I jolted in reflex and the jar slipped out of my hand and fell on the counter which lead to some of the sambar powder getting into my eye. I immediately ran to the backyard and dunked my face into the drum of water and let my eye open under water to rid myself from the pain of chilly powder and spices in my eye.\n\nThat was the moment it all came back. Until then I had been convincing myself that I had a really vivid nightmare and I was just having a tough time processing it. But my luxury of feigning ignorance ended at that moment.\n\nAs I held my face submerged in water looking at the bottom of that barrel, I felt a hand at the back of my neck holding me down. Chill ran down my spine like a million volt electric shock and I started flailing all my limbs trying to push back and break myself out of the water.\n\nI was failing and I started to feel like drowning and fading out as the view under water started turning into an abyss. That was the moment when all the memories of that day came rushing back and I felt like I got hit by a bus. This ignited something in me at that moment and I exerted all the energy I had to push myself up and the hold abruptly disappeared and I fell on my back to the ground due to over exerting myself.\n\nI just sat there for a while, water dripping down my face, just contemplating over everything that happened and trying to put a leash on all the overwhelming emotions that were bubbling up from inside me. When I got back up, I was bone dry. And I started noticing the weirdness around me even more, every waking moment in my life. It was like they had marked me, claimed me as their own.\n\nOne night, I decided to confront them. I made my way back to the clearing in the forest, determined to find out what they wanted from me. But when I got there, it was empty. The bonfire had burned out, the idol nowhere to be found, and the ground was cold and damp. There was no sign that anyone had been there.\n\nAs I turned to leave, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun around, but there was no one there. And then I heard it: the chanting, echoing through the trees. It felt like I had made a mistake, I don't know how to put it, but I just knew I wasn't supposed to be there. So dread came over me and my heart started racing.\n\nI started running, but the chanting followed me. It was like it was coming from inside my head, growing louder and louder with every step. I stumbled and fell, and that's when I saw them.\n\nThey were all around me, their twisted faces inches from mine. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. And then, one by one, they started to vanish, like they were never there at all.\n\nI managed to make my way back home, but I knew that I was never going to be the same. The tantric cult had marked me, and there was no escaping them.\n\nFrom that day on, I could hear their whispers in the darkness, feel their eyes on me wherever I went. It was like they were always with me, just out of sight.\n\nAnd then one night, I woke up to find one of them standing at the foot of my bed. Its twisted face was inches from mine, and it was chanting in that same rhythmic, hypnotic muddled voice. I tried to move, but my body was paralyzed. I was trapped, helpless, as it continued to chant.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the tantrik vanished. I was left alone, shaking and terrified, wondering what it all meant.\n\nI kept trying to rationalize everything, trying to convince myself it's all in my head. But deep down, I knew the truth. They were real, and they had claimed me as their own. And there was nothing I could do to stop them.\n\nFrom that day on, I lived in constant fear of the cult, always looking over my shoulder, always wondering when they would strike again. I often find myself in places I never remembered going to, hours went missing without any recollection, objects I don't remember holding, things I can't explain going amiss.\n\nAnd even now, as I tell this story, I can feel their presence, just out of sight, waiting for the moment when they can claim me once and for all.",

        "text": "Eleven is a conniving number. Wedged between two round, robust integers, it sits on the fringe of all that is balanced. It sneaks and schemes. It lurks and loiters.\n\nI only learnt of the number’s limitless layers when I left a hotel room — numbered eleven — at precisely three in the morning. Right on the hour, minute, and second. I believe that’s how it works, but I only ever received fragmented answers.\n\n*THE ELEVENTH DOOR AT THE STROKE OF THE THIRD HOUR*.\n\nThat sentence was sloppily scrawled on the beige wall opposite my room. I looked at my wristwatch. Three o’clock. If the written message were a prank from another hotel guest, it would have been an eerily well-timed prank. How could anyone possibly have known I’d leave my room at that exact moment? I hadn’t planned my exit. I was heading to the car because I’d forgotten my phone charger.\n\nThe eleventh door at the stroke of the third hour. The odds of those variables aligning are astronomically slim, but it happened to me, so I have to assume it could happen to others. I may be the first victim of this paranormal phenomenon in human history, but I hope to be the last.\n\nThe hotel corridor was a liminal space — a threshold to a world I still don’t understand. It appeared ordinary on the surface, but something about the stark soundlessness of the hallway incessantly irked me. I realised I was utterly alone. I had slipped into a foreign reality.\n\nI turned to my left. My stomach dropped as I squinted at the end of the hallway. Much to my dismay, I found that the hallway *had* no end. I turned to my right. Another assaulting wave of nausea — there was a ceaseless corridor in either direction.\n\nTwisting to face my hotel room, I was at least partly relieved to see that it looked exactly the same. Hoping to latch onto the remaining semblance of normalcy, I stepped back into Number Eleven and closed the door. I took a quick glance at my still-sleeping family, then I opened the door to the corridor again, praying for a different result.\n\nI internally despaired. The words were still there. *The writing’s on the wall*, I mused, not oblivious to the foreboding connotations. The endless corridor had not contracted back to a finite length. I was still trapped in the dreadful alternate dimension.\n\n*Are my wife and daughter trapped with me?*\n\nI re-entered the room and watched the two of them, lost in the land of dreams. They hadn’t exited the eleventh door at the stroke of the third hour, so I hoped they were still in the real dimension, but that hypothesis didn’t entirely convince me.\n\nUnwilling to explore the petrifying place between worlds — having watched far too many horror films with reckless protagonists — I closed the door, undressed myself, and returned to bed. *Adios, Hallway to Hell*, I thought. Out of sight, and out of mind.\n\n*Maybe it’s just a bad dream*.\n\nI repeated that mantra tirelessly. Not so tirelessly that I couldn’t eventually drift off to sleep, however.\n\n“Evan, where’s Malia?” Sydney asked.\n\nMy wife jostled me awake, and I turned to face every parent’s worst nightmare: Malia’s bed was empty. I looked at my wristwatch. Three o’clock. Time was standing still.\n\n“It’s that *boy* she’s seeing,” Sydney huffed. “He’s probably driven over here to pick her up.”\n\nMy foggy brain collected itself, and I attempted to ascertain whether I’d simply dreamt of the never-ending hotel corridor.\n\n“Have you rung her?” I asked.\n\nSydney shook her head, her brow ferociously furrowing. “I can’t get any signal on my phone — I swear it’s been three in the morning on the clock since I woke up. I must be losing it. Maybe I should just peek at the car park to see whether I can spot that boy and his barbaric bike.”\n\nI inwardly smiled at the unintended alliteration, but I still hadn’t registered Sydney’s words. Perhaps something deep within my consciousness wouldn’t allow me to face reality. Some truths are too overwhelming for mortal minds.\n\n“This is our last holiday before she goes to university, Evan,” Sydney sighed, opening the curtains. “I don’t think she-”\n\nMy wife turned to stone. Slowly, but surely, she unleashed an awful, ascending wail. Her entire body was trembling at the sight of the night sky before her. It wasn’t until I sat upright in bed that I saw what she saw. It wasn’t the night sky. It was a void. Eternal blackness.\n\n“Evan… What’s happening?” Sydney whimpered.\n\nI slid from bed, clumsily slithering into my grey T-shirt and faded denim jeans. I could feel the colour draining from my face, and I could *also* feel Sydney noticing that.\n\n“I saw something,” I said. “I thought I’d been dreaming, but now… Are we awake?”\n\nSydney pinched herself. “This seems pretty real to me. What did you see?”\n\nI gulped, gathering my words. “At three o’clock, which feels like hours ago, I left the room to fetch my phone charger. I couldn’t sleep — I was just going to put on an audiobook or something. Anyway, I… Well, maybe I should show you.”\n\nI opened the door to the corridor and quivered at the writing I had hoped I wouldn’t see. My wife peered over my shoulder and gasped.\n\n“Is.. Is somebody tormenting us by-” She started.\n\n“- Look down the corridor,” I interrupted. “Just… It’s going to mess with your head.”\n\nI could only watch helplessly as my wife stepped into the hallway, screamed, and paced to and fro, clutching the sides of her head. Then, suddenly, her face fell still.\n\n“No. It’s a trick. It has to be,” She asserted. “They’ve set up mirrors and… But I couldn’t see my reflection. Okay… Screens? Digital screens?”\n\n“How do you explain the nothingness outside?” I asked quietly.\n\nSydney stormed back into the room, picked up her slipper, and walked over to the window. I followed her back inside. She was presumably hoping to throw her slipper outside and rip the black canvas, revealing the hotel car park behind it.\n\nThat didn’t happen. What *did* happen was inexplicable.\n\nThe window opened, and the colour drained from the room. Not just the colour — the light, the sound, and the *matter*. Swirling towards a plughole, Sydney and I watched our bodies warp and stretch, much like everything else in Room Eleven. We were being dragged into the black absence beyond the window.\n\n“Shut it!” I fearfully screamed.\n\nSydney braced herself against the window frame and the wall, wrestling with the unseen agent of darkness that sought to claim us. Miraculously, she managed to slam the window shut. The room’s colour and physical matter returned to its rightful place — and elasticity. My wife and I collapsed onto the diamond-patterned orange carpet.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a trick of the light,” I breathlessly said. “I felt that. I *felt* the blackness pulling me towards it.”\n\nSydney started crying, so I crawled over to her. She lay in my arms, sobbing whilst I rocked her back and forth.\n\n“Where’s Malia?” She bawled.\n\nIf our teenager daughter hadn’t gone outside, that only meant one thing. She was somewhere within the never-ending hotel. My wife suddenly wrenched herself from my body and ran to the open door.\n\n“I just remembered something,” She said. “Come and look at this.”\n\nSydney pointed at a spot on the carpet of the corridor. To the left of our room, there was a trail of crisp crumbs. Sydney’s eagle eyes astounded me.\n\n“Let’s be thankful for her early-hour snacking,” Sydney said. “I’m going to get dressed, then we can find our daughter.”\n\nSydney quickly donned her golden cardigan and ripped jeans, joining me in the corridor a minute later. My wife dumped a green coat on the hallway carpet, pointing out that it would be wise to leave a marker outside our room. She looked at the words on the wall as we turned left and began our hunt.\n\n“You think you opened a doorway to this place?” She asked.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I said.\n\n“No, I… I just want to figure out how we’re going to open a doorway *out* of here,” Sydney said.\n\nAs we proceeded to follow the trail of crisp crumbs down the beige hotel corridor, I found myself wondering the same thing. I also found myself slipping deeper into the terrifying throes of insanity. The never-ending corridor melted my mind — none of the doors were numbered, and the environment was simply repeating itself ad infinitum. Eventually, of course, the crisp crumbs stopped. We were blindly searching for Malia.\n\nWhen something new appeared on the horizon, Sydney seemed to have renewed energy, and she quickened the pace. I sprinted after her, and we slowly started to distinguish the shape of a vacuum cleaner in the corridor. There was a growing sound too. The vacuum was steadily buzzing away — its squiggly cable disappeared into an ajar door on the left.\n\nA yellow post-it note clung to the vacuum cleaner.\n\n“‘Enjoy your stay. How would you like to pay?’” Sydney read, shuddering. “What the *fuck* does that mean?”\n\nBefore either of us could summon the bravery to push the door, it started to squeak open of its own accord. Our eyes followed the curvy trail of the vacuum cleaner’s cord. There was a chambermaid kneeling on the floor, wriggling from side to side as she vacuumed. She was hidden around the side of the bed, so we could only see her legs and part of her torso.\n\n“Where’s Malia?” Sydney firmly asked her.\n\nMy wife had uttered the question before I had a chance to stop her. The chambermaid stopped moving, and the vacuum cleaner switched off. The room plunged into silence. A horrifying sound, like a rusty tap handle twisting, emanated from the woman as she hoisted herself to her feet.\n\nSydney and I screamed. The chambermaid had a body that was *almost* human, but some anatomical parts had been rendered incorrectly. She had four arms which all hung to the carpet, and her hair coated her entire head, seeping into the orifices on her face where her eyes and mouth should have been.\n\nMy wife and I fled as the rusty squeaking noises of the creature pursued us down the long hotel corridor. We were putting distance between us and the chambermaid, who moved at a glacial pace, but our stamina was dwindling.\n\nSydney eventually swung to her right, fumbling with a door handle, and we both slinked into a darkened room. She hurriedly closed the door behind us, and we waited in the lightless space for the unearthly woman to either lose us or lose interest.\n\nThankfully, we heard the chambermaid’s abnormally-quiet footsteps pitter-patter across the carpet past our room and disappear into the distance. And how wonderful it would have been for the horror to end there.\n\nBut a telephone rang in the darkness.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": " \n\nI know they’re watching me. They’re looking over my shoulder as I write this, but I know they won’t stop me. This all started when I was young. I'm back to \"normal\" and in the human realm, but they never stray far. My mother was the spiritual type and we lived close to the forest. She always warned me about strange and fantastical entities and to never go into the forest alone. Now I understand why. She always did strange rituals, like putting slips of paper with strange symbols in corners of the house, leaving out caps of honey and milk, as well as sprinkling salt in doorways, and putting iron in pouches over the door. She always said it was to appease the “fair folk” but make it clear they weren’t welcome inside. Do you know the fairies from Tinkerbell and such? The friendly ones that are joyful little winged people? That couldn’t be farther from the truth. More like small gods that see humanity as their prey and playthings. This was confusing, but I helped her when I could. I wish I had asked more. I wish she had told me more. \n\nFast forward to when I turned 13, it was a full moon and my mother seemed especially on edge, so I thought I would go pick her some flowers from the forest. They were beautiful in that time of the year and I was sure they would make her happy. As I approached the trees, I immediately heard whispers and glimpses of movement. Being the dumb new 13-year-old I was, I walked further into the forest, ignoring all the warnings my mother ever gave me. By the time I realized the whispering was only getting farther away, I had lost sight of the house. It was getting dark and I felt scared. I tried walking back but I’m pretty sure it just made things worse and eventually I was reduced to a crying mess, crying for my mother to find me. \n\nIt was only after five minutes of sobbing that something strangely repulsive approached me. A short stature, covered in feathers with large animalistic eyes on a spindly body. It spoke in a way that was raspy and almost indiscernible, but I was just able to make it out, \n\n“Young little thing lost and alone. Mayhaps you need help?” I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I almost didn’t, but the word help trumped everything else as I leaned down to see the thing better, \n\n“You can help me?” It nodded enthusiastically. \n\n“I can lead you back home, only if you come to help me with an errand” An errand. My mother ran errands and they always lasted for just a little while. I nodded, not realizing this sealed the next few years of my life, \n\n“I’ll help, what do you need me to do” It grinned wickedly at me, \n\n“You’ll be taking care of me until I die.” Suddenly the world started to spin a little, and my stomach felt like it was going to flip. I blinked once and it was over. We were suddenly in a different forest. One that was vast with trees spanning upward for miles. In the distance a constant fog seemed to roll against an invisible wall, obscuring anything that was past it. \n\nEverywhere were similar creatures to the one I had just agreed to help. Ones of similar size and look, others that were more my size, and some that barely looked recognizable. It would almost be beautiful if not for the fact I was horrified. I was farther from home than ever and just agreed to a task that would bind me to this thing and its world for an unseeable amount of time. The small bird-covered thing seemed to beckon me to follow. Not knowing what else to do, I followed it to what seemed like a hold in the base of a tree, leading into an underground room. The walls were earthy and lined with roots, it almost looked like a living room. Tunnels led off into different rooms I couldn’t see but I wasn’t concerned about that. I simply sat on the ground, too shocked to cry or do anything really. The thing simply shrugged and murmured about letting me get adjusted before waddling away. \n\nI’ll write more later, they’re starting to make me feel uneasy, even if they’re just watching.",

        "text": "I apologize if my English and grammar is off. English is my second language.\n\nBack when I was about 22 in 2013, I worked at a candy store in Berlin as a chocolatier. \n\nAs you can imagine, I eat a lot more chocolate than is considered healthy because of my job. \n\nThis will be important later.\n\nAlso important is that during this time, there was a string of serial murders involving victims being found with their throats slashed open and their blood completely drained. \n\nThe media called them The Vampire Murders for obvious reasons.\n\nI was riding on the bus one day on my way to work. I also had a date with a man after I matched with him on a dating site.\n\nI was standing and holding the hanger. The bus suddenly stopped and my face wound up being slammed into a pole. I ended up breaking my nose and blood splattered on it.\n\nI moved my head and looked up to see a man holding it and I saw that some of the blood got on his hand. The man was tall and thin with dark hair and pale skin. He wore a black coat with a wide brimmed hat, and his eyes were a piercing blue.\n\n\"Whoops! Sorry!\"\n\nThe man was quiet and stoic. He removed his hand and looked at the blood. \n\nHe stared at me. I saw that I was at my stop and got off as soon as possible.\n\nI looked at him through the window and I swore I saw him lick the blood and smile.\n\nI just kept walking to the store and got to work.\n\nOnce I was off, I went home, showered, did my hair, and got into my favorite suit on my way to my date.\n\nWe chose a nice restaurant to meet at. I got my table and waited for my date.\n\nI was so anxious, it felt like he was never coming. And then I saw him.\n\nA tall, thin, pale, and handsome man with long raven hair in a low ponytail and ice blue eyes. He was oddly familiar but I thought nothing of it.\n\nHe looked at me and smiled. He walked towards me.\n\n\"Are you Adam Ziegler?\" He asked.\n\nI nodded and he sat across from me.\n\n\"You must be Karl Mezger.\" \n\nThe man nodded. \n\nThe way Karl looked at me felt off. He looked at me more like a slab of well cut beef than with romance or even lust.\n\nWe ordered food, but Karl didn't order anything. Not even a drink. I thought this was strange, especially since he was so skinny.\n\n\"Are you feeling okay? You didn't order anything.\" I asked.\n\nKarl's eyes widened like he was caught. \"Oh! I, uh, I'm a vegetarian. I couldn't find anything on the menu that wasn't a salad.\"\n\nAs strange as it was, I just shrugged since it seemed to have made sense at the time. Although, I found it strange that he didn't at least order a drink.\n\nI ate my food and Karl continued to stare at me with that same hungry look. I didn't know whether to think he was just awkward or a serial killer. Either way, I felt weirdly tense, like every alarm bell was ringing in my head.\n\nAs soon as I finished my dinner, I got the check.\n\n\"Uh, this was nice but I should be going.\" I said as a way to not potentially provoke him if he was dangerous.\n\n\"Can I walk you home?\" Karl asked.\n\n\"No!\" I spat out. \"Uh, I can walk home by myself. My neighborhood is pretty safe.\"\n\nKarl just shrugged. \"Will I see you again?\"\n\n\"Uh, maybe?\" I said before rushing out without saying goodbye.\n\nI walked home, shivering a bit. Karl didn't seem that bad, but he creeped me out in a way I couldn't explain. I don't know if it was the way he looked at me, the fact he didn't eat or drink anything, or if I was just being paranoid.\n\nI just got home and stood in the shower, trying to calm down from it. \n\nI went to bed after watching some TV.\n\nDuring my sleep, I kept hearing breathing under my bed. I ignored it at first and just chalked it up as just my imagination. \n\nAs I slept, I felt a presence loom over me. Like when your parents are coming to check on you when you are up late. \n\nI opened my eyes and felt my heart jump from my chest. \n\nNext to my bed was a tall, dark figure drenched in shadow, with the only thing being seen was two piercing blue eyes with bloodshot sclera.\n\nI screamed and rolled out of bed in the opposite direction. I picked up a nearby bat and wielded it like a knight holding a sword.\n\n\"Who the hell are you!? Get the fuck out of my house!\" I yelled.\n\nThe figure turned on my lamp and I gasped. \n\nIt was Karl. He had a crazed, hungry look on his face and I swear his teeth looked sharper than normal.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I mouthed.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll make it quick.\" Karl assured, smiling.\n\n\"What are you? Did you follow me home!?\"\n\nKarl snickered. \"I knew where you lived as soon as I tasted your blood on the bus.\"\n\nThen it hit me, Karl was the man on the bus.\n\n That's why he seemed so familiar. \n\n\"What-How!? What are you!?\"\n\nKarl didn't seem to know. \"I was always like this. Ever since I was born I could only consume blood. Any other food and I would vomit it all out. The sun would burn my skin and I couldn't go out without a hat or coat. Any blood I consume not only allows me to track down my prey through it, but everyone's blood has a distinctive taste. Yours is quite delicious. It's quite sweet with the right amount of bitterness to not make it sickening. I'm assuming you are a candy maker based on that?\"\n\nI felt sick hearing all of that. Karl was not human, or if he was, he was a mutant. \n\nI ran out of my room to get out and get a police officer. I heard a knife from my kitchen being taken off of my knife rack and saw Karl, now enraged and looking more monstrous holding a butcher's knife.\n\nHe lunged at me and attempted to stab me. I moved as quickly as I could and I hit him in his back before running to hide.\n\nI hid in my bathroom and saw I left my cell phone in my breast pocket.\n\nI looked around to make sure the coast was clear before dialing 110. \n\n\"110, what's your emergency?\"\n\n\"Listen, I am hiding in my bathroom and someone followed me home trying to kill me!\" I whispered. \"I think he is the Vampire Murderer!\"\n\n\"Okay, sir. Can I get your name and address?\"\n\nI told them my name and address.\n\n\"Okay, the police will be on the way. Just stay where you are.\"\n\nI thanked them and hung up.\n\nI listened behind the door and didn't hear Karl. I peeked under it and didn't see anyone. I took this as a sign that Karl either gave up and left or he was in a different room.\n\nI silently crept out, bat in hand. So far, no homicidal vaguely human killer.\n\nI went past the kitchen and I heard something. I hid behind the counter and sat.\n\nI heard light footsteps accompanied by loud clacks of heels. I was waiting for Karl to leave or go somewhere where he couldn't see me.\n\nI stopped hearing the footsteps. I peeked around the corner and saw nothing. I sighed and I was about to crawl out and get to my front door.\n\nUntil I felt a sharp pain in my foot caused me to accidentally throw my bat. I turned and saw Karl stabbing the heel of my foot. \n\nI used my good foot to kick him off and pulled myself up on the counter, accidentally knocking off some pots and pans.\n\nI hobbled to the other side, but I slipped and fell to my knees. Karl walked to where I was and he climbed on top of me.\n\nI thought it would be the end, but I saw the frying pan on the floor.\n\n\"You're mine, Adam. You'll taste amazing!\" Karl snarled like a dog.\n\nI slid the pan to my palm using the hole at the end of the handle. I gripped it tight.\n\nKarl reeled his head back to strike like a snake. I took the window of opportunity to wack Karl as hard as I could in the side of the face. Karl let out a cry before falling to the side.\n\nI got up and saw Karl was knocked out cold. I even knocked out one of his teeth. I picked it up and it was sharp like a shark's tooth.\n\nI heard a knock at the door. I hobbled over and opened it. It was a police officer.\n\nI let him in and he saw Karl unconscious. I explained the whole thing and showed him the tooth. The officer took it and put it in an evidence bag.\n\nI winced from the stab wound in my foot I barely noticed because of the adrenaline. An ambulance was called and Karl was taken to a separate hospital.\n\nI had my foot patched up and had a blood transfusion to replace the blood I lost.\n\nKarl was arrested and I hadn't heard much from it.\n\nAt least until an officer came by one day to update me on him. \n\nThere we learned that while Karl was in the hospital and looking through his medical records, it had been revealed that Karl had two rows of teeth, one set was human-like and one was sharp. Both were retractable. \n\nKarl's skin was highly sensitive to sunlight and would form blisters and scars if exposed to it.\n\nWhen he had an X-ray performed, his organs were shown to be somewhat unusual. His digestive system was formed in a way that makes it to where he can only digest liquids, much like a vampire bat.\n\nWhile these things were unusual, a DNA test revealed that he is human. So, as to whether or not he is some sort of mutant, has an unknown disorder, cursed, or maybe vampires aren't as supernatural as we thought, I'm unsure. And to be honest, I don't care.\n\nIt had been some time, I am now living with my current boyfriend and I had been occasionally hearing about the trial. Karl admitted to being the killer and was sentenced to life in prison and will be executed the next day.\n\nI was satisfied with that sentence.\n\nOne day, me and my boyfriend were cleaning up and a letter came in through the mail slot.\n\nI picked it up and saw it was addressed to me. I felt a hard object inside it.\n\nI opened it and I felt my blood run cold.\n\nThe envelope contained that very same tooth that I knocked out of Karl's mouth. \n\nAnd then the letter.\n\n'I am coming for you, Adam. You will be mine.\n\n♡ Karl Mezger'\n\nOn the TV, which we had on for background noise, announced this.\n\n\"We interrupt this program for an emergency broadcast! Notorious serial killer, Karl Mezger aka The Vampire Murderer, had escaped from prison! Keep your doors locked, don't travel alone at night, and keep yourself armed! He is a 34 year old male, caucasian, blue eyes and black hair!\"\n\nI almost couldn't believe what I heard. My boyfriend looked with horror at the TV. I looked at him and we got together.\n\nWe made sure to arm ourselves with a UV lamp we got from a camping store and my bat. \n\nIf he comes back, I'll be ready this time. If he comes back, I'll kill him myself if it comes down to it.",

        "text": "Last night I found some strange things in the dark streets. My story started last night, after dinner. I was going outside for a short walk, through the dark streets. Soon I started to get a strange feeling of dread, and my head was hurting more and more. Soon I had to take a break on a hard bench. There I saw a figure in the distance with grey skin, pure black eyes and extremely long nails.  I thought it was probably somebody in a weird suit, but things quickly changed after that.\n\nI started to be paranoid after a while, yet I didn’t know why.\n\nThen I started seeing a hooded figure appearing and disappearing in the far-out woods, which I initially thought was just a normal person blurred by the dark distance between us. Yet soon it looked as though surfaces were melting, with my chair feeling strangely liquid.\n\nI didn’t notice the time or what I was doing as I stayed in a tired, hallucinatory state on the bench.\n\nI’d start to see the same creatures across my surroundings getting closer and closer to me, yet I could not quite make out what each of them were.\n\nAfter some time I started to notice something strange was happening. The environment was getting strange and creepy over time. Soon I started to hear far-away screams getting louder over time. At 11, after two and a half hours of sitting on the same bench I decided to get up and  walk back home. Soon I was too tired to even stand up properly, collapsing on the asphalt.\n\nI started to dream of strange terrifying sights, including the grey-skinned creature I had seen before. The terror continued half an hour later when I woke up. I looked towards the darkness next to an old building and saw a strange silhouette with long horns looking towards me.\n\nBack then thought I was hallucinating, although now I wouldn’t be so sure. Soon I saw it approach one of the building’s few lights when I saw his skin was all red. Then I began to hear a strange voice in my head whispering: “Tom commands you.” By then I was starting to panic a bit.\n\nThe voice became more common, and the hooded figures and grey creatures appeared closer and closer. Madness was descending. I couldn’t think. I didn’t know why things were so tense, but something was clearly controlling my emotions. “Tom will soon appear.” said the voice in head. Soon madness would truly arise. I found myself close to home when the grey creature came to me saying: “I am the Unknown. Death will come to you.”, while blocking my way. Then came a hooded figure, whose head could not be seen, saying “I am Robert the Hooded Figure, and I will bring you to me as I did Martin.”\n\nI shrieked in fear, yet nobody heard me. Then came another beast, with red skin, claws and gazelle horns. It the silhouette from before, now shown to be a gazelle demon. “I’m Martin the Gazelle Demon, and you will soon be just like me.” While I was cornered in the wall, another figure came, in the shape of ghost-like plume of black smoke. “I am Tom the morpher, that which makes Gazelle Demons.” it said.\n\nMy feet disintegrated, my head started to hurt more than ever before, the world looked as though it was melting and my skin turned red. The horns of a gazelle came out of my head as my nails turned to claws. Then my feet came back and my vision was normal, but the form I was in has not changed. I am a gazelle demon, just like Martin. I’ve been living in isolation ever since, fearing others may look down on my new form.",

        "text": "The higher up people live in a building, the safer they feel leaving their windows open.\n\nThe ground floor? Absolutely not. What if someone climbs in??\n\nThe first floor? Well, maybe. People won't exactly climb up. But still, don't leave them open if you're going on holiday.\n\nAnything above that? Seems pretty safe. People leave some windows open literally constantly. I mean, what kind of dangers are going to find you so high up...?\n\nIf you live above the 10th floor, you won't want to find out. Leaving a window open could be the most innocent grave mistake you could possibly mistake. My warning to you is not about falling from your window ledge - Even windows that are restricted to only open by about an inch are dangerous. If there is the slightest way inside, he will find it.\n\nStories of The Thing That Hovers circulated when I was a child. Kids would claim that at night, they saw something slowly hovering down the street, about 100ft in the air. They would all have different descriptions of it - A small glowing orb, a creature with red eyes, a dark cylinder. But the stories all hit the same notes.\n\nThey all looked out of their bedroom window at around 3am. They all saw something high in the sky - but not too high. They all immediately felt filled with dread, despite nothing bad actually happening, and had to look away.\n\nI have now learnt why.\n\nI live on the 11th floor of this student accommodation building. The kitchen is shared with a few other people, I don't really know them that well. We only talk on a need-to-talk basis, although I think a few of them are friends with each other. Regardless, it means that whenever I'm at home, I'm in my bedroom.\n\nI'm usually awake quite late. Whether it be gaming, or studying (usually the former). Last night, it wasn't either, though. I've been stressed a lot recently, and I found myself sitting up in bed, staring out my window. It was cracked open just a bit, to let a small breeze in. I don't know how long I sat like that - It was just relaxing. It was nice to look down at all the people of the night. Some clearly drunk, and others just walking as if it's not the middle of the night. It's that second group I find the most interesting. I find myself making stories up in my head - Where they could be going at a time like this, who they are, and whether they do this regularly.\n\nAt some point, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something. Something not down below or way up high. Something right at my level.\n\nIt was hard to see it in the dark. I wasn't so much looking at this than I was looking at its silhouette, as it moved in front of the dimly lit windows of the building across the road. The room directly across the street had its light on and curtains open, and it was the best light source I had. It didn't seem to be any shape to me, more like a cloud of smoke. One that didn't rise, but just moved, in unnatural ways. I immediately thought back to the childhood stories of The Thing That Hovers.\n\nIt began to get closer to my window. Slowly, slowly, and slower still. But moving all the same. The whole while, I kept looking behind me, as if something was already in the room. This thing made me feel on edge.\n\nI thought once it finally reached my window, I'd be able to see it clearly. To see that my imagination was getting carried away. \"Oh, it's just a bag in the wind,\" is what I was hoping to think. Instead, I just found my bedroom window covered. Blackness, all over it. It was as if my view of the city became a window into the void.\n\nI felt dizzy, and my vision felt...off. Like looking at it was wrong. Every bone in my body was telling me to look away. But I'm glad I didn't because I noticed some of the smoke beginning to leak through the cracks of the window. I have never closed it so fast. I even locked it - Something I never do, because why would you when you live this high up?\n\nI felt slightly better immediately. The view slowly came back, as The Thing That Hovers moved away. I had to lie down for a while, and clear my head. I had a headache that seemed to punish me for not looking away. Despite this, once it cleared up, I sat back up, and looked out my window.\n\nI noticed that the room directly across the street from me no longer had its light on. At least, that's what I thought, until I looked closer.\n\nIt was there. It had covered their window, and was getting in. Their window must've been open more than mine, as it didn't take long for it to get inside. I never saw it leave, because I closed my curtains at that point, and didn't look outside again.\n\nThis morning, people are talking about the man who was found dead across the street. I don't know for sure, but my gut tells me he must've lived in the room I saw it enter. I haven't told anyone what I know yet. I'm scared to.\n\nBut I have been thinking today, about what this thing is. I think I understand its behaviour now. Clearly, it feeds on people, but what if it also hates to be seen?\n\nIt only travels at night. High up enough to not be illuminated by street lights, but low down enough that it can still climb inside windows.\n\nIt always has a different shape for every person. One that creeps them out. Not one that *scares* them - Humans love to stare at things that scare them. But we always look away from things we find creepy.\n\nEverything about it seems to show that it hates to be seen. A silent killer, that only targets people who think they're safe, and does everything it can to make sure you never see it coming.\n\nSo, if you live above the 10th floor, don't leave your windows open. Not unless you're ready to meet The Thing That Hovers.",

        "text": "‘Chicken’, that petulant taunt is what sticks in my mind, why did I have to rise to the bait. My once simple existence has now been consumed by chaos, all due to that small, single, seemingly insignificant fucking word. If I’m going to relive these nightmarish memories, I’m taking you with me.\n\nIt was October 27th 2007, the days were growing shorter and the nights grew ever longer. I’m Benjamin by the way but everyone calls me Ben. Being your typical 18 year old, I would normally spend my evenings in my room on windows messenger with my friends Paulo, Tyler, Sarah and Dani. We all attended the same college together four days a week. The rest of the time we used to hang out on the grounds of a long time closed and decaying private School, situated at the end of a single track road called Charter Lane. \n\nWe would meet up with a few other groups of people that we knew from college in the unused run down playground. Someone would be inevitably playing music off a small tin sounding portable speaker. We would bring a couple of crates of beer and some cheap ass vodka that tasted more like paint stripper to fuel our fun.\n\nKyle was one of the guys that would always be here, like one of them people that were ‘always out’ if you know what I mean. He would frequently climb onto the old school building and clamber through a small skylight window to grab cans of drink and snacks from the abandoned vending machines inside. He would always come out looking all smug, like he’d just won money from a slot machine. This was except for that one night, yeah this is where my nightmare begins. \n\nThere was only five of us and Kyle over at the playground that Saturday night, the girls Sarah and Dani, were chatting half way up the blue paint peeled climbing frame with Paulo. Him and Sarah had been having a thing for about the last 3 months, they hadn’t said anything but we all knew about it. Me, Tyler and Kyle were sat around a small flickering fire, that was barely keeping lit in the chilled October breeze. Each  one of us passing a small joint around to aid in our attempt to keep warm. \n\nKyle stood up.\n\n“You know what time it is guys!” He said trying to contain his excitement. \n\nI gazed up to him, “go on then spidey!” I chuckled sarcastically.\n\nDani shouted over “get some chocolate for me this time Kyle, please!”\n\nHe turned, pulled the hood of his red hoodie over his head and gave her a quick wink “of course babe, anything for you”.\n\nShe held her hands up in a heart shape and announced “My hero!”\n\nAs he faded from the fire-lit glow, I could see him proceed to a small wall next to the building, he jumped up and hoisted himself up onto the flat roof above. His faint outline seemed to evaporate into the darkness. We were now one  crate and half bottle of vodka into our night. It had been about 20 minutes since Kyle had gone in to the school and he still hadn’t emerged. We were all sat around the fire trying to scare each other about the history of the school, the rumours of past murders and torture were rife in our area.   \n\n“Kyle is normally back by now, it’s been like 20 minutes” Tyler interrupted. \n\n“What are you his mother?”Dani said in between sipping the dwindling bottle of vodka.\n\n“He probs just went to a different machine, don’t worry” she continued.\n\nWe all paused for a minute as if all in deep thought of where Kyle could be, only the slight crackle of the fire sounding in our ears. The silence was shattered with an uncontrollable horrific scream, coming from inside the school. \n\n“What the fuck was that” Sarah breathily whispered from her hand covered mouth.\n\n“That’s got to be Kyle, shit maybe he’s hurt” Paulo responded. \n\nWe all got up and started walking towards the desolate structure. We began calling out for Kyle. \n\n “Stop messing around dude and get back out here” I yelled.\n\nOur cries were met only by eerie deafening silence. \n\n“Right, fuck it, I’m going in” Tyler confidently stated. \n\nPaulo followed up with “we should all go in,  come on it’ll be easier to search the place with 5 of us”. I saw him give Sarah a quick wink from the corner of my eye. \n\nI quickly tried to rationalise the situation.\n\n“I think we should stay out here, at least wait for 5 or 10 minutes, if he’s not out by then we  can call someone for help”. \n\nTyler smugly replied “What’s wrong Ben, Chicken?”\n\n“If your too chicken Ben, you can stay out here while we go in” Dani said while placing her arm around Tyler. \n\n“I ain’t no chicken, come on let’s go” I responded while pushing Paulo out of the way, I then proceeded to climb onto the roof and down through the open window. I helped the others down, one by one until we were all standing in a large corridor. I had a small flashlight in my coat pocket, luckily I had remembered it before I left the house. Paulo also had one with him, it was in his small Nike bag. That thing always seemed be attached to him, like a holster to a cowboy.\n\nThe corridor was blank and hollow, it reminded me of the halls throughout a hospital The only difference was the floors were littered with old books and pieces of broken ceiling panels. We decided to split up as we didn’t know which way Kyle would have gone, none of us had actually been inside the school before. We all found it odd that we didn’t hear any other noises since the initial scream. \nPaulo went off behind us with Sarah, then Me, Tyler and Dani went in the opposite direction. We slowly wandered past at least a half a dozen old classrooms. The ones we could see into were trashed, not even a chair was upright. There must have been people living in here at one point due to the stained single mattresses and discarded food wrappings on the floors. \n\n“It’s amazing there was anything left in the vending machines” I said trying to lighten the tense mood. \n\n“Yeah true, they’re probably hidden away somewhere” Dani responded.\n\nWe all came to an abrupt halt, there was a faint squeaking sound coming from up ahead. It sounded like an old wheel in dire need of some oil. I lifted my flashlight and illuminated the passage ahead. The sinister sound suddenly stopped but i could hear what sounded like white noise coming from one of the rooms in front of us. \n\n“What the fuck is that?” I whispered to Tyler and Dani.\n\n“It’s probably just Kyle fucking with us” Tyler said before starting to shout “Hello, Kyle, we know it’s you, stop messing around man!”\n\nThe steady squeaking then started once again with the white noise accompanying it. Emerging from one of the open doors further ahead rolled an old static screened tv placed on a metal trolley, the power cable trailing behind it. We all took the same deep gasp, as the full of tension cable sprung out from the room it came, as the screen turned to a black luminous glow.\n\nTyler now with fear in his voice shouted “Kyle, stop being a dick, this ain’t funny anymore!”\n\nHe snatched the flashlight from my grasp and marched up to the room that the TV had come from. We followed nervously behind him and scoured our eyes around the now lit room. No one was in there, no cupboards or rooms to hide, just nothing but scattered wooden debris. The goosebumps started to form on my arms as a  bitter chill fell upon us.\n\nDani muttered “I want to get out of here, I don’t like it, I just want to go home”. \n\nTyler, now seemingly discounting the last few minutes snapped back “it’s Kyle alright, he is trying to scare the shit out of us, that’s all”\n\nDani nodded her head while stuttering “OK, I just don’t like it here”\n\nI was freaked out and I had the same unnerving thoughts running through my head as Dani, but I wasn’t going to leave my friends alone in here. \n\nTyler passed me back our only light source, as we hesitantly carried on down the corridor. A couple of minutes later we heard what sounded like hushed muffled footsteps that were running behind us. I pointed the flashlight from where we had just come from. There was nothing but debris, but the heavy fast paced steps where getting louder, which could only mean they were getting closer. We were just about to  make a run for it when Paulo came into sight.\n\n“Guys, stop, wait” he shouted while trying to catch his breath. \n“What’s wrong? Did you find Kyle?” Dani responded, I could tell in her voice that she wanted this night to be over. Only finding Kyle would mean that we could leave. \n“No, I can’t find Sarah, she was right behind me”\nPaulo then proceeded to tell us how they had blown off the search and found a room for some alone time. They were on their way back to us, when he heard a thud followed by a dragging noise behind him. He searched the rooms around him but she was gone, she had just vanished. \n\nMy apprehension was now only growing with every passing minute that we were in this tormenting school. We all decided to walk back and look for Sarah, she may have just wandered off or even left. \n“Here, this is where we were” Paulo said while pointing, I could see the anxiety in his eyes. \n“Shhh, Listen, do you hear that?” Dani whispered behind me. It sounded like the constant drip of a tap coming from the room up ahead.\nTyler again took the flashlight from me and said,\n“Let me have a look”,\nHe walked slowly up to the crumbled opening and cast the light into the room.\n“Fuck!” He winced while flinching his body away. \n“What’s wrong?!” Paulo asked, the concern in his voice was harrowing as he walked towards Tyler.\nHis head turned and he fell to his knees, through flowing tears as he uttered “no, Sarah”. \nMe and Dani nervously walked up to Paulo and Tyler, there sat in a wooden chair was what was left of Sarah. The drip of her crimson blood fell from her hand as it dangled lifelessly beside her. Dani screamed and buried her head into my chest as she started to weep. I felt a combination of numbing pain and sickness. Who would even do this to a person? I asked myself just as my thoughts were interrupted by Tyler, who said while giving me back my flashlight. \n\n“This has to be Kyle, that sick son of a bitch” the anger in his voice seemed to snap Paulo from his wailing trance. \n\n“I’m going to kill him” Paulo snarled while fighting back his tears.\n\nWe all, in that moment had the exact same thiught, how well did we actually know Kyle?\nA whistle echoed from the darkness ahead, our gaze altered in unison. \n\nTyler announced “it’s him, come on guys, let’s get him”.\n\nTyler and Paulo started running down the corridor towards the whistling.\n\n“Tyler, Paulo, wait up!” I shouted as their flashlights faded around the tight bend ahead. \nThe whistling then abruptly stopped.\n\n“What the fuck!” I heard Tyler shout as I pulled Dani round the corner with me. \nThen the shrieking painful scream of Paulo consumed us as I engulfed the walkway in light. Just in time to see Paulo’s legs and boots slowly slip into a room up ahead. A smeared trail of blood followed him starting at the planted feet of Tyler. He was stood, unlit flashlight in hand covered in the splattered blood of Paulo. \n\n“What the fuck happened man?!” I yelled at Tyler. \nHis face stared blankly at me, his hands shook uncontrollably as he struggled to say the words.\n \n“The flashlight turned off, I felt something brush across me and then I heard his cries” he said while tears now started forming in his eyes. His previous confident demeanour had been replaced by a broken, fear stricken shell of his former self. \nA terrifying laugh began to ring around us, it bounced off the cracked walls as it droned off into the shadowy depths behind us. I directed the flashlight towards the source of the menacing cackle, there was a pile of debris that ran right across the hall further up. What I saw next made my blood run cold, facing the wall at the end of this seemingly never ending corridor stood Kyle. He was wearing the same trainers, ripped jeans and red hoodie. He was writing a strange language in what I can only assume was blood on the wall, Paulo’s lifeless body laying by his feet. \n\n“Kyle?” I called out, hoping for a reasonable answer to what was going on. \n\nHe stopped writing, his arm slowly dropped beside him. \n\n“Kyle please, what ever is going on let us help” Dani innocently cried out beside me. \n\nA rolling crunch followed as Kyle’s head fell backwards between his shoulder blades. We all jolted back in pure disgust as we stared into his glazed, clouded over eyes. His face was grey, and populated with raised blue branching veins. Deep red blood then slowly began to flow from his nose and eyes. He spoke words from is foamed mouth in a language we didn’t understand. \n\n“Moriatur, auferam caput tuum. Bibe humores de corpore exanimo, et carpe dentes meos ossibus tuis.”\n\nMy knees buckled from fear, we all knew that we had made a big mistake. We should have left this place after we saw that rogue TV, wheel itself into our path. We all turned and ran, I could hear a fourth set of running footsteps in the deathly dark behind us. All of a sudden I heard a scuff and a smack behind me, Tyler had tripped over a chair. Me and Dani slowed our pace as we realised, this was quickly followed by the sound of ripped clothing and the deafening sounds of Tylers last breath. I mustered the strength to pull a large old wooden cabinet over, across the corridor. I grabbed my lighter from my coat pocket and lit a few old textbooks. I threw them all into the antique piece of furniture, it then exposed the gruesome scene we had left in our trail as it set alight.\n\nI clung tightly to Dani’s hand, our reverberating pulses pumped as one, as we sprinted towards the skylight window in-which we entered this hellhole. I moved a chair into position underneath and pulled myself out. I began to pull her up as I felt a sudden resistance, Dani started screaming, smoke filled the opening around us making it almost impossible to see what was happening. I used the last of my strength to pull, she immediately became lighter. I looked down, her sparkling wide eyes watered as blood trickled from her gaping mouth. That’s when I noticed, her torso had been ripped in half.\n\n“I’m so sorry” I sobbed as my grip loosened and she fell back into the plume of black smoke. I hurriedly closed the window and jumped from the roof into the darkness below. I heard a crunch from underneath me as I landed. This would later turn out to be my right ankle breaking, I felt no pain as the adrenaline coursed through my battered body. I ran as best as I could out of the rusted gates while frantically dialling the emergency services.\n\nIn the weeks after the raging fire was extinguished and the investigation was in full force.  They found four mutilated charred bodies inside. It seemed Kyle was never found and for a brief moment I became a prime suspect. Only for a nearby security camera, that caught Kyle and us climbing into the old school, then me clambering out while trying to save Dani cleared my name. Even though that wasn’t enough to prove my innocence to a lot of people in the area.\n\nNo one ever did find out what happened to Kyle. The police searched the area for months, but they found no trace of him. \n\nThree torturous months later I got the first phone call, I answered the unknown number. I half expected it to be a detective going over the past events that had consumed my life.\n\n“Hello”. \n\nA deep demonic yet familiar voice answered me,\n\n“Moriatur, auferam caput tuum. Bibe humores de corpore exanimo, et carpe dentes meos ossibus tuis.” \n\nThe line then went dead. \n\nI have since looked up this horrific phrase that has been etched deep into my brain, this is what it roughly translates into:\n\n“Die, I will take your head. Drink the juices from your dead body and pick my teeth with your bones”.\n\nI knew in that moment that my cursed torment was not over, it had only just began.",

        "text": "  It was just another day in town for me when I chanced upon the poster. Getting high on caffeine at the local coffee shop while trying my best to force out words that weren’t there, staring at the blank digital pages as if I could intimidate them into spewing out poetry. Frustrated, I walked out of the coffee shop for fresh air. Leaving my laptop behind.\n\nOh God, the shame. I can’t even describe it.\n\nTwo minutes. I left for *two* minutes, and when I came back, it was gone. The coffee shop was empty. The barista had gone out for a bit, maybe to take a smoke, I don’t know. When he got back, the laptop was gone.\n\n“Damn it,” I cursed, kicking dumpsters and banging my fists on the wall once I was a good ten minutes away. The barista wouldn’t appreciate it if I strangled him to death. And I *really* didn’t need to get a restraining order from my favorite coffee shop. Not when I was this close to finishing…\n\n“Fuck!” \n\nThe data. All of it. Gone. The whole manuscript had been stolen. All because I hadn’t been able to control my fucking temper and fucking stay at the fucking coffee shop. I could’ve carried it with me. I could’ve stayed there for a few more minutes. I could’ve done *anything* but leave around eighty-thousand words on a table, ripe for the taking.\n\n“Okay Sam,” I muttered. “What now?”\n\nCall the police? Who cared about some dinged-up old laptop?\n\nFind the thief myself? Maybe if I’d done some digging when I got back, but by now they were probably a good distance away. Probably skipped town. That’s what I would do.\n\nTell my parents? I sighed, imagining the conversation. Something like this, I’m guessing:\n\nMom: “And why were you at the coffee shop?”\n\nMe: “Studying”\n\nMom: “Your schoolbooks are right here, young man. You went to work on that stupid novel of yours again, didn’t you? I told you it’d be better for you to study. But no, you just have to write that novel. It can’t wait until after your exams are done. It has to be now. I swear I have no idea why God gave me such an ungrateful son. Your father works every day to support you, but do you show gratitude? No. All you do is…”\n\nI’d rather pluck my own teeth out. \n\n*Well, at least dad’s not gonna be home for the week-*\n\n“Hello there!” a voice chimed.\n\nI tried not to jump out of my skin or fall into the dumpster. Whether or not I succeeded at either of these things is up to you guys. But I’ll just say one thing: dumpster diving is not for the faint of nose. Or lungs in general. \n\n*I should write a guidebook. Dumpster-diving 101. At least people would actually read it.*\n\n“Ooh, that’s a good idea,” the voice said, apparently unconcerned with the fact that I was covered in trash and smelling worse than my dad’s cooking. “I bet I could help you with the project. I bet I could help you with any project, in fact.”\n\n*Wait, what?* \n\n“How did you-“\n\nI fell into the dumpster again. This is my second time if you’re keeping count. Two times more than any seventeen-year-old writer should experience in his formative years. All in one night. All because of my laptop and that stupid talking poster.\n\nLife isn’t fair.\n\nOnce I’d successfully gotten the banana peels off of my face, clothes, and hair, I managed to keep up a semi-coherent conversation with the poster. Starting with the ever-so-famous ‘WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?!”, I tried my best to note down its features in my mind. \n\nThe poster itself was movie-sized, with a solid black background. Taking up the vast majority of the space was a bone-white comedy mask that looked to have been inspired by the Greeks. Except, as far as I knew, those masks couldn’t speak.\n\n“Are you done ogling me?” the masks asked. I felt blood rush to my cheeks.\n\n“S-sorry,” I muttered. The mask laughed.\n\n“Don’t be. It’s not every day that you see a talking poster you know? Savor the moment.”\n\nI exhaled, thankful I hadn’t offended my new friend. Now to start asking more questions. Like whether or not I was having a psychotic break. \n\n“Why is it that everyone who sees me thinks that? It’s insulting. Even our manager, bless his poor, dead heart. Always asking me questions about things and getting shocked when I knew the answers. He thought I was a hallucination too.” The mask said, still wearing that smile. Its eyes were narrow crescents that must’ve been cut by a very precise knife. \n\nOr created using photoshop. That works too, I guess.\n\n“Where did you come from?” I said, wondering whether or not I should touch the thing. Would it be considered rude? Unfortunately, poster etiquette was a subject my parents had neglected to teach me (and if you’re wondering why I didn’t teach myself, stop asking good questions).\n\n“Oh, behind that brick wall,” the mask said. “Your yelling caught my attention.”\n\n“Oh, that…” I winced, sheepishly rubbing the back of my neck as I tried to justify my position. \n\n“I know your situation, Sam,” the mask said. “And, if you want, I’ll help you out.”\n\nI recalled what the mask had said before my fall from grace. “You said you could help me with any project?” \n\n“Yes,” the mask said, positively beaming by this point. Its eyes curled up even more, and its impossibly large grin grew. It should’ve been creepy, but some part of me felt strangely drawn to him. For whatever reason, I felt comfortable in his presence. He radiated compassion. \n\n*He wants to help me*, I realized. He-\n\n*It*. I apologize. Slip of the tongue. *It* wanted to help me. \n\n“What do you want for it?” I said. The mask’s grin curled downwards. A pang of guilt hit me like a brick. I didn’t-I hadn’t meant offense. Oh god, what had I done?\n\n“You think I want something from you?” the mask said somberly.\n\n“Oh, my boy, I desire only to aid you in your craft. I will take the words directly from your heart. With every bit of love I find within, I will create the greatest works of literature ever to be read! Do not fret about prices, my friend. The works of your heart and soul are all I need.” He said.\n\nHis smile was like the winter sun breaking through the cold night. It warmed everything around me. \n\n“We’ll need to get my laptop back first,” I said. “It has everything I’ve ever written.”\n\n“It shall be done,” the mask promised. “Come back to me once you’ve retrieved the device, and together we shall begin.”\n\nI left after that, my mind spinning with promises and hope. It was finally gonna happen! My big break! Now everyone would know how good I am. I’d finally leave my mark on the world! \n\nMy parents kept asking me why I looked so happy at dinner. I just told them I was glad to be with them. They wouldn’t understand my happiness. They never did. I bolted upstairs and tried my best to go to sleep after that.\n\nThe next day, I woke up to find blood seeping through the gap underneath my door. My heart began to speed up. Time seemed to slow down. Blood pounded in my ears as I opened the bedroom door, slowly walking towards the kitchen. \n\nWith each step I took, I felt more and more numb. Like my mind was trying to prepare me. But nothing could’ve prepared me for what I saw.\n\nI couldn’t even recognize them. \n\nThe police say that they died while I was sleeping. A full eight hours before I woke up. A full eight hours, in which I heard nothing, smelled nothing and felt nothing. Nothing but guilt. \n\n*This is all your fault*, I thought. It was true. I could’ve done anything but sleep. I could’ve washed the dishes. I could’ve watched a movie with them like they’d asked me to. I could’ve cuddled up in their arms as I used to when I was five. Anything except leaving them alone to fight for themselves.\n\nI shook my head. No. I couldn’t think like that. I couldn’t. This wasn't my fault.\n\nThat was when I noticed something. My bedroom. A strange flash of color. I walked towards the door. There it was. My laptop stood on the table; a single post-it note plastered onto the top. \n\n“Midnight. Bring the laptop \\~ Orpheus”",

        "text": "  \nI'm writing this because I don't have much time left, and I want people to know the truth, while I still have the chance to tell it.  \n\\-  \nRight now, I'm locked in the attic in an old farmhouse.   \nI've been stuck here in this house for hours, and now the laptop is slowly dying.   \nI want to go and get the charger, but I know I can't risk it.   \nPeople, an angry, raging mob, surround the place, screaming threats and demands to me, ordering me to come out.  \n\\-  \nThey tell me to come out or they'll shoot. They tell me to come out and they'll shoot.   \n\\-  \nThey think I'm a killer. They think I'm evil.  \nThey hate me, for what they think I've done.   \nThey want me dead, no matter what.   \nAnd no matter what, the only thing I know with certainty, I won't be leaving this property unless it's in a body bag.   \n\\-  \nI am crying so hard my eyes are blurry and it's really hard to see what I'm typing, but I'll try my best to get it all down.   \nI want others to know, that what's about to become some poorly written news..   \nIt's not what it looks like. I'm not killer, no matter what they try and say.   \nOnce upon a time, really not that long ago, I was just a normal person.   \nI was just like you. And then I made a mistake.   \n\\-  \nWhen I finally got home I was frozen and damp, chilled to the bone from the winter storm outside.   \nI went to have a shower, turning the water on while I gathered my towel, but as soon as I stepped into the shower, I discovered my room mate had used all the hot water.   \nGrumpily, even more cold and now dripping wet, I wrapped the towel around myself and sat infront of the oil heater, while it took another half an hour for the feeling to come back in my fingers and toes, and my hair dropped dry all over the floor.   \n\\-  \nMaryann, my room mate, came in a little while later, the banging and repeated dropping of her keys while she attempted to unlock the front door, told me she was drunk, before I had even laid eyes on her.   \n\\-  \nI braced myself for impact, wondering just what version of Maryann I would get tonight.   \nThe crying drunk, depressed about the failed acting career and the fact she was now a check out chick at the age of 35.  \n\\-  \nOr the happy, excited Maryann, who would keep me up all night discussing unachievable dreams, making plans that would be soon forgotten, never to come to fruition.   \n\\-  \nBoth were equally exhausting, turned me into a babysitter comforting her for the rest of the night until she eventually fell into a restless sleep.   \nI never really minded that much, but I was just so tired.   \nAll I wanted was an early night.   \n\\-  \nMaryann stumbled in, bright red hair flashing in the florescent kitchen light.   \nHer sequined mini dress shimmered, creating an eriee shadow that danced around her.   \nShe braced her self against the wall, eyes tightly closed, looking as if she would either cry, or vomit.   \n\\-  \nIt took her a moment to register me, sat infront of the heater on our rug less hardwood floor.   \nShe peered at me through bloodshot eyes, looking at me as if I was a stranger in my our own home.   \n\"What the hell are you doing?.\" she slurred, her voice full of rage. \"You shouldn't be here.\"  \n\\-  \nI was dumbfounded, confused.  \nHad I mentioned that I was going out? I tried to recall, but it was doubtful I had.   \nMy social life was severely lacking, and while I had been looking for a job, my searching had never turned into anything. So, I was home the majority of the time.   \nI'd seen many versions of drunk Maryann over the last few months, but I'd never seen an upset, accusory one.   \n\\-  \n\"You shouldn't be here.\" she repeated, angrier, more frustrated.   \nHer eyes flashed with rage as she leered towards me, pointing her finger hard aginst my chest as she got close enough for me to smell the sourness of her breath.   \nHer breath stank, like the vile, potent air of poison and I needed to get away from it so I could breath.   \nI backed away instinctively, and she followed, her hand not quite quick enough to hold on to my chest as I ducked out of her reach.   \n\\-  \nIt was as if time was in slow motion when I watched her fall.   \nI saw her eyes, as the recognition of the situation happened, the way her outstretched arm tried to get a grip of the coffee table she was headed towards.   \nI saw her hand miss, flying through the air just centimeters away from the table, and then watched as her wrist crumpled up against the floor, as she landed.   \n\\-  \nThe sounded she made when her forehead connected with the corner of the glass coffee table, brought bile to my mouth. I rectched, emptying my stomach where I stood.  \nI had never known that a sound could be physically sickening, or that the simple sound of a crunch, would forever bring goosebumps to my skin.   \n\\-  \nI stood, frozen, and watched as the blood pooled around Maryann's head in a gooey red halo.   \nI whimpered to her, asked if she was okay.   \nI don't know why, it was stupid in hindsight.   \nI hadn't really thought she would reply in the first place, given the sound, the amount of blood. I just didn't know what else to do.   \n\\-  \nThe shrill sound of a phone ringing brought me back to my grim reality.   \nI knew instantly it was her phone, and I wondered what the hell to do. Obviously, I couldn't answer. But I didn't want her silence to cause concern for worry, either. Didn't want it to mean someone may come over and knock, looking for Maryann, wondering why she hadn't replied or answered her phone.   \nI needed time, to think.   \nTo work out what the fuck I was going to do.  \n\\-  \nI didn't want to touch Maryann, but I had no choice. Unfortunately, the ringing phone was coming from the back pocket of her jeans, and I needed more than anything in that moment to silence it.  \nI was surprised she was still warm, but then again, I had no idea how long it would take a body to go cold.   \nI had only watched snippets of CSI here and there, and for the first time ever wishing I had been a bit more of a true crime fan.  \nI wondered briefly if I was leaving DNA, but I couldn't get my thoughts coherent enough to process that question while that shrill ringing was still sounding.  \n\\-  \nI looked at the missed calls list, my hands trembling so much I was worried I might drop the phone.  \nRici.  \nI had no idea who that was, I strained my memory for Maryann mentioning them in any of our previous conversations, but I drew a blank.  \nWhile I was holding the phone, lost in thought, a text message chimed through.  \nIt was from the same number who had been calling, this Rici.   \n\"Enough, stop ignoring me. I'm sorry, k? Call me back please. Love you, Mare.\"  \nI knew first hand that Maryann could be pretty stubborn.  \nI'd seen the way she held grudges, even over the most trivial of things.  \nI turned her phone off, placing it into my own pocket. I didn't think it would be too unlike the real Maryann, to not reply until she was good and ready.  \n\\-  \nThe night passed in a blur.   \nI spent the most time not looking at Maryann, at the tuft of red hair that was poking out of the plastic shower curtain I had ripped off.   \nI had managed to drag into the shower curtain I had ripped down.   \nAfter practically exerting all of my physical energy moving and wrapping her up, I was spent.   \nI cleaned as best I could, scrubbing and wiping, replacing dirty water with clean.   \nAt that particular moment, I was grateful for our lack of proper furniture, no rugs to have to attempt to rid of unwanted stains.  \nBlood was easier to mop on hard floors.  \nIt was there one minute, a big, sticky mess of red. And the next moment, it was gone, wiped clean, like it had never even been there at all.\n\n\\-\n\nI slept fitfully, dreaming of Maryann waking up, wriggling her way out of the curtain she was wrapped in, coming to find me and seek revenge.  \n\"I'm sorry!\" dream me screamed loudly, but it didn't matter one bit.   \nDream Maryann ignored my cries and advanced towards me, her body rotting and the white of her skull visible, peeking through her face.   \nI was terrified, rooted to the spot in a primal fear, unable to move, though I wanted nothing more than to escape.   \nLuckily, I woke up in a cold sweat, right before she got the chance to get to me.   \n\\-  \nWhen I woke up properly, it was mid day.  \nI'd never been much of a sleeper, so I was shocked I had managed to stay asleep so long.  \nMemories of the night before came back in a hot, uncomfortable rush, and without another moment, I tiptoed to the bathroom with bated breath.  \nI had to know.. And know, I did.   \nIt was real, what had happened.   \nMaryann lay in the tub, wrapped in the shower curtain, the tuft of her red hair still visible from the top.  \n\"I'm sorry.\" I say softly, and she doesn't reply, of course.   \nI look at her for a few more minutes then I leave the bathroom and go outside.  \nI breathe in the fresh air, and in the early afternoon sunlight, I step onto the grass and I make my way to the small garden shed outside.   \nI wonder if she has any power tools laying around.  \n\\-  \nIt wasn't nice, what had to happen next, so I won't go into details.  \nSuffice to say that after a few YouTube videos of butchers hard at work, I was pretty prepared with what I'd need to do, and how it needed to be done.   \nI certainly wasn't prepared for the nausea that came.   \nI spent more time vomiting, than I did actually.. working.   \nI wasn't really prepared for quite how long it was going to take, or the mess that would occur, either.   \nAnd another thing I want to make clear.. I didn't enjoy it. It was awful, horrendous.   \nIt was just something that had to be done.  \nI spent the rest of my evening cleaning, the smell of bleech gave me an absolute pounding headache, so when my work was done, I found a black pair of leggings and a black parka, ready to change into later.   \nI had a long nap, setting my alarm for 10pm.  \nIt was going to be easier to go out unnoticed later at night.   \nWhen it was dark people seemed to keep to themselves more, plus it would be harder to make out the black garbage bags I would be carrying.  \n\\-  \nAfter saying goodbye to Maryann, and reading her a little poem I'd written as I dropped her off, I headed home and tried to go back to sleep.   \nIt was impossible, I was agitated, full of nervous energy. I paced until I heard the truck breaks, the electric roar of their claw moving.   \nI watched out the window, steaming coffee in hand, as the industrial bins in the furniture warehouse a few blocks away were emptied.  \nI wished Maryann a final goodbye, and closed the blinds.  \nIt was a new day, and I had a lot of work to do.   \n\\-  \nMaryann's room was messy.   \nPlates with old food and cigarette butts were scattered around on most surface I could see.   \nThe room stunk like stale beer, off food.  \nClothes covered the floor, while there were discarded bras hung over lamp shades and lacy undies - which I highly doubted were clean - were piled up high in the corner.   \nMaryann didn't have much in the way of personal effects.   \nIt was my first time being inside her bedroom, and I was surprised by the lack of anything personal that wasn't clothing.   \nThere were no posters or artwork, no photos with family, or friends.   \nI knew for a fact that Maryann had an array of friendships, she was always going out, always busy with being social.   \nI srounged through her chest of draws, more clothing, and I felt almost ready to give up.   \nAnd then I got lucky.  \n\\-  \nMost of us have that place where we keep all our most important documents.  \nBirth certificate, health insurance, tax details, house contents policy. You get the picture.   \nSometimes, depending on what kind of person you are, it was kept together, in a shoebox in the cupboard maybe, or a suit case under the bed.  \nIn Maryann's, in my case, it was in a chest or draws, in a large white envelope.  \nI wasnt expecting much, if I'm going to be honest.   \nSo when I pulled out a house deed from the envelope, I was shocked.   \nThere's no way that I would have ever thought that Maryann could have owned a house, let alone a home on a large property, but here it was, written in black and white.  \nIt didn't make sense.   \nShe was living in this shitty, 2 bedroom unit with me, when she could be in her own place?  \n\\-  \nThe next interesting thing I found, was the car insurance.   \nI'd never known Maryann had a car.   \nShe walked everywhere, catching taxis at night if she was too drunk to stumble home. I didn't even know she could drive.   \nA grey toyota sedan.   \nThere was one parked in the share parking lot, and I should know. It had been there since I'd moved in, I saw it, walked past it, every day when I left or came back home.   \nI'd always assumed it belonged to one of the other unit blocks on the surrounding streets.  \nMaryann had dropped her keyring on the table she had gotten home drunk, and they were still there when I went looking.  \nI noticed the other keys then.  \nFour keys in total.   \n3 keys that did not belong to our house.   \n\\-  \nMaryann was a bottle redhead, and she was nothing if not loyal to her hair.   \nShe maintained it to a point of obsession, and I was grateful for that when I saw the box of dye in the bathroom cupboard.   \nOnce i had a few outfits picked out (and washed clean!) from her bedroom floor, I set to work on dying my hair.  \nIt had been an age since I'd changed my appearance and it felt liberating in a way, seeing the difference in how I looked.  \nI pulled out Maryann's drivers license, held it up to the bathroom mirror, to compare our faces.  \nWith my new hair colour, it was pretty uncanny. I never realised how similar we had looked, before all this.   \nI just needed to add a bit of make up, some bright red lippy, and we could basically pass as the same person.  \n\\-  \nThe silver sedan in the lot was her car, of course. It started on the first go.   \nOne of the mystery keys was then accounted for.   \nI put the address that was on the house deed into my phone maps, and I drove off.  \nI didn't have a plan, per se. I just needed to get out of that house.   \nAfter the last few days, it would be good to clear my head a bit.  \nAs I sped down the highway, I practiced introducing myself, saying my new name.   \nI knew it would take a while to get used to, I wanted to get it perfect before I needed to put it into use.   \n\"Oh hello there, I'm Maryann.\"  \n\"I'm Maryann, it sure is nice to meet you. \"  \nIt took the whole drive, but by the time my directions announced my arrival at my destination, the words flew off my tounge fluently, as if that's how I had always, and only ever, introduced myself.  \n\\-  \nThe property, and the house was stunning. Green paddocks. A long, luxurious tree lined driveway.   \nThe house wasn't huge, it was a 2 story cottage style ranch, but while it wasn't overly big in size, even from the outside looking in, it seemed big on character.  \nI knocked, and no one answered which I kind of expected, and definitely hoped for.   \nI'd had no idea what I would have said, of course, had someone answered. But I was lucky, I guess.   \nOr so I thought at the time. As I said before, hindsight.. It's a funny thing.   \nPerhaps, looking back.. If there had been someone else here.. Someone else to verify my true identity, well I probably wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.  \nBut I can't dwell on that stuff.  \nI can hear wood splintering. It sounds as if they're breaking down the door.  \nI'm scared.  \n\\-  \nWhen I first got here, I checked the place out. It was pretty empty. Old furniture, a handful of ancient boardgames.  \nI looked around for anything that the keys would fit into, but found nothing.  \nNot until I stumbled across the basement door.  \nIt unlocked easily, the sqeak of the door opening echoing down the stairs, through a hollow room.  \nI listened,.waited. I half expected to hear mice scurrying around, but I heard nothing.  \nI tried the light switch at the top of the staircase, but nothing happened.   \nIt wasn't until later I noticed the bulb had been removed.   \n\\-  \nI didn't have a torch, so I just used my phone light.  \nThe basement was just as boring as the rest of the house. Old. Dingy.  \nI was making my way back to staircase when my light flashed over something shiny.  \nThinking it could be something useful, or if I'm totally honest, something expensive, I slowly guided my light to find it again.   \nMy light came to rest on the shiny again, and I will say it took me longer than I care to admit, to work out what exactly I was staring at.   \nIt was like something out of a horror movie, melted skin dropping over skeletal remains.   \nIt's a Halloween decoration, I told myself, breaking out into a nervous laugh.   \nBut then I saw the hand cuffs, the metal chain that held them to the wall.   \n\\-  \n\"What the fucking fuck?\" I was looking at a dead body.   \nI was looking at a dead body, that was.. Or had been, at least, tied and chained to the basement wall.   \nThey had obviously been here for sometime, they were quite decomposed.   \nFrom looking at its face, I couldn't tell if it was a man or woman, it's age, nothing important at all.   \nThe clothes they wore were barely still intact, navy pants thick with grime, and what I'm assuming had once been a blue button up shirt, was nothing more than a dirty, worn out rag now.   \nI stumbled back upstairs, slamming and locking the basement door behind me.   \nI had left one house of horrors, and unknowingly, unwillingly, walked right into another one.   \n\\-  \nIn Maryann's bedroom, things made more sense.  \nShe may have not added her personal touch to her room in the home we shared together, but here, in this farmhouse.. She was everywhere.  \nA marriage certificate was framed, hanging nestled amongst the tonne of photos on the bedroom wall.    \nMost of the photos were framed as well, and hung proudly on display, others, seemingly just as loved, stuck to the wall papered walls with Blu tac.  \nSmiling faces, twinkling eyes.   \nIn one photo I saw it, I saw them.   \nI saw the same navy pants and blue button up shirt, they were being worn by a man with a thin brown mustache and black framed glasses.  \nHe had his arm around Maryann, and they were both smiling broadly for the camera.  \nThey looked happy.  \n\\-  \nI'm eating a tin of cold beans when I heard the car pull up.   \nI guess someone must of called the cops. Probably a nosy neighbor, who saw me drive in earlier.   \nCountry people were like that. Always sticking their noses into other people's business.   \nI finished my spoonful of the cold beans and slinked over to the window, where I was able to get a view of the front yard, without being seen.   \nIndeed the police were here. I watched a middle age man get out of his car.   \nHe gave the house a once over, a solemn expression on his face as his did so.   \nAnd then his expression turned sinister.   \nHis eyes lit up, but it wasn't with excitement.   \n\"Oh Maryann,\" his voice boomed in sing song, and I felt my blood run cold. Something was not right.  \n\"Come out, come out, wherever you are. Let's have a chat, just you and I. Before the others get here. I think you owe me that at least.\"  \nIf I glanced out the drive, I could see at least another 4 cars coming down the road.  \nThey weren't patrol cars, though.   \nThe cars are instead a mixture of pick up trucks, utes and sedans.   \nNot for the first time tonight, I start to wonder just what the hell Maryann had been up to.   \nFirst the man, I was assuming her husband, laying dead and restrained in the basement, the key miraculously on her keyring.   \nI couldn't work out what to make of that.   \nMaybe it was better I didn't.   \nAnd it seemed as if she had a personal vendetta with some towns folk, including a cop, as well.   \nI started to think i had made a mistake.   \n\\-  \nSoon there was more people milling around outside than I could count on two hands.   \nThey had been banging on the door, on the windows. Rocks being thrown, glass smashing.   \nThey screamed at me, telling me, in vivid detail, what would happen to me once I ended up in jail, if I even made it past them in the first place.   \nI sat in horrified silence, listening as they described how I, but actually Maryann, had killed two of their beloved children in a hit and run.  \n\"Drunk and dumb, fucking slut!\" one woman's voice roared, earning a cheer from the rest of the crowd.  \nThey're getting closer, so I take the laptop and I run.  \nThe basement feels safe, safer, for now.   \nI can hear wood splintering, heavy footsteps coming closer and closer.  \n\\-  \nI know I don't have much time left, I just hope this uploads before the laptop goes flat.   \nI can't stand people to not know the truth.   \n\\-  \nI guess you might be wondering, why I didn't call the police straight up when Maryann fell and banged her head?  \nIt was all an accident, after all.   \nIt would have been the easy thing to do, right?  \nOf course.   \nThe thing was, Maryann had kicked me out 2 weeks earlier.  \nShe was hot headed, and she held grudges, I knew this firsthand because I had been on the receiving end of it.   \nWe got into a fight over something small, and it esculated into something huge.   \nI wondered if that's what happened to her husband, if they'd had a fight and that's why he was decomposing downstairs in the basement as I typed.   \nI wasn't exactly breaking and entering, when she came home that evening and caught me drying off by the oil heater.  \nI mean, I still had a key.  \nShe had asked for it back a few times, but I'd never gotten round to it.  \nAnd really, it was so cold, so wet out.   \nI hadn't any luck finding a new place to stay. No chance of scoring a rental on my own, either, not in this market.   \nMaryann usually went out most nights, coming home late and drunk out of her mind.  \nI thought it would've all been okay.   \nI wasn't expecting her to come home.. And she wasn't expecting me to be there, either.  \n\\-  \nAs for me.. I guess I just wanted to start a fresh.   \nI saw an opportunity present itself, an opportunity to start over and be someone else, and I took it.  \nBecoming Maryann, meant I was free.   \nEven if it was just for a moment, one little, wild ride.   \nPosting with 8% batter life left, it's time for me to go.   \nNo point waiting, I'm going to talk to them, explain I'm not who they think I am.   \nThey either believe me, believe my story, this story, or they don't.   \nThanks for listening to what may very well be my last words, Reddit.   \nIf I make it out of here, I'll be sure to update.   \n\\-",

        "text": " \"You still haven't told me why you asked me out for Valentine's Day…\" I reminded Kyrie.\n\n\"Don't worry.\" She smirked. \"If you haven't figured it out by the end of the night, I'll tell you.\" Her gloved fingers slid between mine and she gave my hand a little squeeze.\n\nI couldn't believe this was happening. \n\nI'd had a crush on Kyrie since the moment we met–\n\nEven though she'd shown up at my apartment with a guy I couldn't stand. \n\nJohnny was my roommate's best friend. He and his crew only ever showed up after midnight: drunk, high, and looking for trouble. Things were always broken or missing in the morning, but my roommate Nate refused to control his friends.\n\nThe night I met Kyrie, I woke to the sound of drunken giggles and the apartment door slamming open. \n\n“What’re you just *standing* out there for?” a slurred voice shouted. “C’mon in! It’s cold!” \n\nI groaned: *Johnny.* \n\nIn the main room, I could see my roommate Nate leaning boozily against the wall. A big blonde girl tried to dance on our coffee table and kicked a hole in it. Meanwhile, Johnny was ranting about a band he hated and preparing a line of coke on a handheld mirror. \n\nBlood rushed to my head; I was shoving my way toward him before I had time to think–\n\nMy parents had struggled with addiction all their lives, and a dirty needle had been my mother’s death sentence. I didn’t want to SEE that stuff, didn’t want it in MY home, where I lived…\n\n\"Put that away! Get it outta here!\" I snapped.\n\n\"Come on, man! It's my party fuel. Don't like it? Go back to bed.\" Johnny sneered. A short girl with frizzy brown hair watched me carefully.\n\n\"It's his house, Johnny. His rules.” The girl rolled her eyes. “Don't like it? Get your own place instead of mooching off of Nate all the time.\" Johnny turned red and glared at me…but he also put the coke away. \n\nKyrie introduced herself, but I can't remember anything about the conversation; I was too focused on her dark hazel eyes and how my heart was racing in my chest. After the party, she did something none of Johnny's friends had *ever* done: she stayed to help clean up. \n\n\"By the way, Kyrie asked, wiping a red Jell-O shot off of the counter, \"what are you doing for Valentine's Day?\" \n\n\"Well it's a Tuesday, so probably work and then the gym.\" I laughed, then started rambling; I couldn't help myself. \"I mean, I'm sure I'll end up getting on a dating app or going to a bar, because nothing's worse than sitting at home alone on Valentine's Day–\"\n\n\"How about I pick you up at eight?\" Kyrie asked. My jaw dropped. At some point I must've nodded, because here I was, on my first date of the new year. If it *was* a date. \n\nEven when we walked hand-in-hand into the ice-skating rink, I wasn't *completely* sure what I was doing here.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the skating rink was packed with couples. Some twirled, others stumbled, but as we laced up our skates, Kyrie pointed to a young man and a five-year-old child. \n\n\"Look at those two. What do you see?\" She whispered to me.\n\n\"Uhhh…a single dad, I guess?\" I grasped for more details. The handsome young man held the boy's hand, teaching him.  \"They're both struggling, so I guess it's their first time here…and judging from the way he keeps looking around and checking his watch, he's probably meeting somebody here...\" \n\n\"You notice things.\" Kyrie raised an eyebrow, impressed. \"That's one of the things I like about you. Keep watching.\" \n\nWe made our way onto the ice; I did my best to keep an eye on the pair in the sea of skaters. A strikingly beautiful woman with raven hair stepped effortlessly onto the ice, all smiles. The man grinned and waved. *His date was here.* He embraced her, but his boy tried to pull away. The kid stomp-skated away, looking over his shoulder with wide-eyed fear. His father and the new date followed. The man barely seemed to notice his son; he just stared into the woman's eyes dreamily and allowed her to lead him around the ice. \n\nI had to admit, I understood the feeling. I couldn't say exactly *what* it was that made the raven-haired woman so special…but it was hard to look away from her. She twirled her date gracefully and pressed him against the rink barrier. Leaning in close, she whispered something into his ear; he lay back and closed his eyes, savoring it. Like he couldn’t believe his luck.\n\nMeanwhile, the boy was running out of energy. He grabbed his knees, panting, and the raven-haired woman shot across the ice toward him like a swooping owl. An expert skater, she clamped a hand over his mouth with one hand and guided him to the exit with the other. \n\nIt was over before I could react, before I even realized what was going on. A sea of happy couples blocked my path to the door. \n\nThe boy’s father rubbed his eyes, glancing around like a man waking from sleep.\n\nThen the panic set in.\n\nHe stumbled around the ice, grabbing people, asking if they'd seen his son. Kyrie tugged my hand gently, urging me to follow. But by the time we reached the packed lobby and clumsily pulled off our skates, I knew that it was already too late: the raven-haired woman and the boy were long gone. I stared, slack jawed, at the man's babbling attempt to explain what had happened to the rink attendant; Kyrie tugged my hand again:\n\n\"We should go.\"\n\n\"You knew.\" In the snowy darkness of the parking lot, I confronted Kyrie. \"How?\" She smirked and kept walking. \"HEY!\" I shouted, \"that man's son could be in danger! What's going on?!\"\n\n“Like I said, you notice things. I’m confident you’ll figure it out.” Kyrie looked up into the cloudy night sky and sighed, an unreadable expression on her face. \"But first, you sound like you need a drink! I know a club downtown…” \n\n*'XXY'* read the pink-and-purple neon letters above the solid metal door. I'd never heard of this place–or even this street–before.\n\nBut then, I hadn't been to a club since college. I really, *really* hoped Kyrie wouldn't expect me to dance. \n\nA burly white guy in a skintight black t-shirt nodded to Kyrie and opened a solid metal door. A feeling of foreboding filled me as I looked down the dark staircase on the other side. How much did I really *know* about Kyrie? Did I really want to go down *there* with a girl who I'd only known for a few hours? With a girl who’d just watched a live kidnapping and done nothing to stop it?\n\nKyrie looked up at me with her dark, curious almond eyes. Before I knew it, we'd checked our coats and descended into *'XXY.'*\n\nWith the glowing red lights, fog machine, and writhing shapes, the club reminded me of hell. The heat from so many dancing bodies made it about as warm, too. We squeezed our way through the sweaty crowd to the bar, where Kyrie gestured to a guy in a leather vest and chaps who looked like a supermodel. Moments later, he slid an Old-Fashioned over to me. *How had she known it was my favorite drink?* I reached for my wallet, but Kyrie shook her head. \n\n\"Do you come here often?\" I shouted lamely over the pounding music.\n\n\"Almost never.\" Kyrie laughed, \"but there's something that I want you to see…\"\n\nI groaned inwardly. *Not again.* Kyrie gently touched my wrist. She pointed to a tall, bald African man in a suit.  His hollow eyes were locked on a skinny blonde guy wearing a mesh t-shirt. The college kid was clearly hopped up on the Redbull-Vodka drinks that were the club's specialty, dancing his head off in the heart of the crowd. \n\nAs the hollow-eyed man moved toward him, I realized that the man didn’t just have a sunken face: his eye sockets were completely empty, with nothing inside of them but hungry darkness. The crowd parted for him. People seemed unconsciously repulsed by the gaunt figure, even though I had the strangest feeling that they couldn't even see him. The hollow-eyed man halted just in front of the blonde dancer, and when he did, the young man froze. \n\nIn fact, *everyone froze.* From the bartender to the raving crowd, all their heads dropped to their chests just as though they'd fallen asleep standing up. \n\nDeafening dance music boomed from the speakers for a completely still and silent crowd.\n\nThe hollow-eyed man lifted the blonde dancer's chin; their lips clamped together in a violent kiss. The dancer's throat grew swollen, bulging as the hollow-eyed man sucked the life from him. \n\nI tried to move, but couldn't; I was just as paralyzed as everyone else. \n\nIt felt like an eternity before the dancer crumpled to the ground, a hollow sack of skin and bones. Beneath his mesh t-shirt, he had the starved look of a death-camp victim. \n\nThe hollow-eyed man scanned the room, apparently satisfied–for now. To my surprise and terror, he nodded in our direction before walking–no, *drifting*–up the stairs. \n\nThe metal door slammed shut and every head in the club snapped up at once. People blinked confusedly and resumed dancing, oblivious to the grotesque sight on the floor. Kyrie took her fingers off of my wrist and gave me a look I recognized. \n\n\"*We s-should go*, am I r-r-right?\" I suggested, unable to control the shaking in my voice. Kyrie nodded and led me upstairs through the oblivious crowd.\n\nOutside, I lost it:\n\n\"Okay, I don't know what this is, but it is *NOT* a date.\"\n\n\"Huh.\"  Kyrie put a fist on her hip. \"I thought for *sure* you would've pieced everything together by now.\" \n\n\"This isn't funny!\" I shouted. \"People are getting hurt! What the hell was that thing?!\" \n\n\"Come with me to one last place.\" Kyrie grabbed my hand with both of hers. \"If you still don't understand why I'm doing this, I'll tell you after. *I promise*. Besides, aren't you hungry?\"\n\nI was starving, actually. But it was after two A.M. and the roads were slick with ice. Where the hell was going to be open at this time of night?\"\n\nThirty minutes later, Kyrie watched me wolf down my syrupy waffles and cheesy hash browns with a bemused expression on her face.\n\n\"Sho, Whadd Joo Wanna Shuuu Me Adda Pamcake Houze?\" I asked through a mouthful of food.\n\n\"I just wanted you to eat a nice meal so you don't start feeling faint.\" Kyrie smirked. \"Don't you believe me?\" \n\nI shook my head. \"I just saw a guy get his guts sucked out like he was a goddamn crazy straw. I'm not sure what to believe anymore.\"\n\n\"Good. That means you're getting closer to the truth.\" Kyrie ran her fingers up my forearm. \"Come to the bathroom with me.\" \n\n\"What? Here?! *Now?!*\" I looked around incredulously. Kyrie lifted an eyebrow and guided me toward the restrooms. \n\nI blushed, sure that someone would see when Kyrie yanked me by the collar through the door of the men's restroom. There was no one standing at the three sticky urinals or sitting in either of the two stalls–no one who *I* could see, anyway. Kyrie took me into the smaller stall, locked the door, then pulled me up so we were both standing on the toilet lid. There was barely enough room on the white plastic for both of us. I could feel our chests pressed together, her fingers on my back…\n\nThe restroom door flew open and a guy in dirty black boots staggered in.  \n\n\"Dumb slut…\" he moaned to himself as he struggled to find his zipper, \"I spent like thirty bucks on her tonight! She *owes* me!\" Through the crack in the stall door, I could see where the drunk braced himself against a urinal.\n\n*It was Johnny.*\n\nFrom where he stood, pissing, he couldn't see the pale, naked, genderless figure that was crawling out of the ceiling tile and down the wall. Kyrie covered my mouth a split second before I screamed. \n\nThe pale thing approached Johnny silently from behind until it's gnarled toes were practically touching his heels. \n\nOblivious, Johnny zipped up–\n\nBut before he could turn around, the pale thing stepped…*into him.*\n\nJohnny's clothes and skin yielded like foam as it slipped on his flesh like a pajama onesie. His face shifted from shock, to agony, and finally to horror before finally settling into an expression of featureless calm. \n\nThe new Johnny paused in front of the mirror, trying out his hands and fingers like stiff new gloves. Those hands combed a part into Johnny's usually unruly hair, then caressed his chest with the glee of a long-caged animal finally set free. Every trace of drunkenness was gone; the door slammed shut as a shiny new Johnny left the restroom with swift, professional strides.\n\n*\"What. The. Fuck.\"* I mouthed to Kyrie. She jumped gracefully down from the toilet, unlocked the door, and motioned for me to follow. \"There's…there's things like that everywhere, aren't there?\" I stammered. \"We just don't notice them…\" \n\n\"Especially tonight.\" Kyrie nodded.\" All the eager couples, the first dates, the hookups, the alcohol and loneliness…Valentine’s Day is a feast day for creatures like these. *You said that 'there was nothing worse than being alone on Valentine's Day:'* I wanted to show you that you were wrong…and to protect you, if you did go out.\"\n\n\"...but…why…?\" \n\n\"When you yelled at Johnny that night, I could tell that you'd lost someone special to addiction…\" Kyrie rolled up her long sleeves. The track marks were too obvious; I couldn't stop myself from reaching out to touch them. \"I did too:\" Kyrie went on. \"Myself.\" \n\nTwo horrible truths struck me at once: there was no pulse in the veins beneath my fingertips, and–according to the mirror across from us–I was alone in the men’s room. “I was already on my way out from an OD when my Sire sunk her fangs into my neck. It’s a shame. If we'd met when I was still alive, we might have been very happy together.”\n\nI backed away until my back pressed against the cold tile wall. \n\n“I hope you heed my warning when I tell you to hurry home, and that you remember this lesson for next year.\" Kyrie smiled. \"The night is young, you see…and I still need to feed…”   \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

        "text": "Alright, my name is Alex. I’m currently living in a two-story house. I moved out to the countryside about two weeks ago. It’s been a dream come true, I used to be in an apartment. One night I was scrolling through this real estate listing website when I saw this listing for a two-story house for less than $50,000. I knew I had to jump on the opportunity. It was a long drive, but well worth it. I arrived and was stunned, the house looked to be in pristine condition. I unlocked the front door and stepped inside. The air was musty and stale as if no one had been there for a while. I shrugged it off. I didn’t find it too much of a problem, nothing that some air freshener couldn’t fix. I started unpacking all of my stuff when I first noticed a strange presence. I started looking around, just to confirm I wasn’t losing my mind. I went upstairs and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I continued my search until I reached the basement door. I placed my hand on the door handle but was suddenly overwhelmed with dread. I immediately took my hand off the doorknob. I decided that I wouldn’t go down there until I needed to, at least that’s what thought jumped to mind as I backed away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went back to unpacking my stuff, it took me a good 4, maybe 5 hours to completely have all my stuff packed away. I was exhausted, so I walked up the stairs to the master bedroom. Collapsing on the bed immediately. It felt amazing like I could sleep forever. It only took me about 5-10 minutes before I fell asleep, however. I didn’t stay asleep for too long. It was about 2 hours later that I awoke at midnight on the dot. A strange noise invaded my ears, someone was stomping downstairs. I was taken aback, I slowly stood up, trying not to make much noise as I reached for a nearby bat, I had stashed next to the bed. I got up and made my way to the door, reaching out towards the knob. It seemed right as I touched the doorknob to exit the room, all noises ceased to exist. I had thought I had gone deaf because of the true lack of any noise. I couldn’t even hear my breathing, but perhaps I was holding my breath. I opened the door and walked down the stairs. Everything was still quiet, with the exception now of my ragged breaths. I reached the bottom of the stairs and flicked on the lights, raising my bat high. I was expecting to see someone crouched down but instead was met with nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lowered the bat after taking a thorough look around the bottom floor, making sure I had locked all the doors and windows. Ensuring everything was locked tight, I froze when I turned to see the basement door ajar. I must’ve stayed still for what felt like hours but in reality, it was only a couple of minutes. I silently walked forward, once more holding my breath as I quickly shut the door. I could’ve sworn that the door was shut when I had first looked around. I started catching my breath, I was mentally and physically exhausted from what had occurred. I made my way back up the stairs and entered the bedroom. I placed the bat next to the headboard as I collapsed on the bed, unable to sleep for the rest of the night. Daylight began to take hold of the sky when I finally decided I should get up, no way I was catching any more sleep this night. I went downstairs and began making myself a pot of coffee. I ran through the night in my head once more, I couldn’t shake the fact that the door had been opened slightly. I kept glancing over at the basement door. It was a truly eerie feeling I was getting from that damn door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinishing my coffee, I washed the cup and grabbed my keys from a nearby rack, and left to head to town to the market. Oddly enough I only purchased some coffee for myself the previous day before arriving. The scenery outside was spectacular, the house was surrounded by dense woods with a driveway that was nearly a mile long leading to the main road. I never really understood why people loved living out in the countryside, but it didn’t take too much to convince me. This was the best option for me. I could finally focus on saving money and bettering myself. I arrived at the closest market, waking inside I was met with an employee greeting me. “How’re you doing today, sir?” the employee asked. “I’m doing relatively well, thank you,” I replied, walking past the checkout counter after grabbing a shopping cart. I walked to some coolers nearby, taking a couple of packs of eggs and bacon. I placed them in my cart, heading down another aisle. I finished picking up my food items when the smell crossed my mind, reminding me that I needed to grab some air fresheners. I grabbed a few of them and walked back up toward the checkout area. I paid for my items and walked outside, carrying everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlacing the items in my car, I hopped in the driver's seat. I began the journey back home once more. It was around midday now. It took time to get back and forth in this town. I reached the house and was getting out of my car when I took a look over at the first-floor window. I freaked out when I saw what looked like a face staring at me. I was terrified, and with a sudden rage filling me, I rushed to the door. Unlocking it, I flung it open. I looked around with confusion as nobody was there. “Damn mind!” I exclaimed out loud. Must’ve been from the lack of sleep, I thought. I walked back to my car, gathering what groceries I had purchased. I shut the door, locking my car before I turned to walk back inside. I stepped inside and the stench was much more noticeable. I immediately took the package of air fresheners out and plugged them into the wall outlets lining the first floor. I saved the biggest one for the upstairs bedroom. I placed the groceries in the fridge and put any remaining in the pantry. I cooked a meal and ate alone in the downstairs kitchen. I was watching TV when I heard a noise coming from a few feet away. I felt a strong feeling of dread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walked towards the basement door, instinctually I knew the presence was coming from there. Upon reaching the door, I had a strange feeling of tranquility. I opened the door and walked down the stairs slowly. The tranquil feeling dissipated as I reached the bottom step. It was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything, I felt around in the darkness for a light switch, but none could be found. I walked back up the stairs, realizing I’d need to use my phone for a flashlight. I grabbed my phone off the table and began to walk back. On the last step of the stairs, I turned on my flashlight. I saw a strange door on the far left wall, I slowly walked up to it and opened it. I was met with a disturbing sight. All on the ground were carvings of pentagrams. The writing on the walls depicts a man with a goat’s head. I was frozen, I felt like I was paralyzed. I heard the door slam behind me. I started panicking, I rushed over to the door and began kicking it with all of my might. From the darkness behind me, I felt something place its hand on my shoulder, whispering in my ear “No escape now.” a voice said with a low and guttural pitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe blood running through my veins was cold, and I felt a sense of impending doom looming over me. I slowly turned to see a pair of red, malevolent glowing eyes staring into my soul. The pentagrams below me began to light up, an immense red light painted the walls with its scarlet hues. I felt a symbol engraved on my chest. In one instant, the lights returned to normal, the grip on my shoulder eased and the door opened up with a sickening bang against the wall. I rushed upstairs, slamming the basement door shut. I ran to my bathroom, inspecting the symbol plastered across my chest. It was an upside-down cross inside of a pentagram. The burning sensation never eased. I’m posting this now because I cannot shake the feeling of being watched. I’m constantly in fear of being attacked and I feel tonight may be the night it comes to take me. I’ve been up for the past two hours writing this; I can’t shake that looming doom feeling. The symbol on my chest has been burning bright red for the past 30 minutes. I’m afraid by the time someone views this, I’ll no longer be of this world. If there is one thing you can take away from this if you find yourself having a weird feeling outside of a house that seemed too good to be true deal. Please just walk away.",

        "text": "Alright, my name is Alex. I’m currently living in a two-story house. I moved out to the countryside about two weeks ago. It’s been a dream come true, I used to be in an apartment. One night I was scrolling through this real estate listing website when I saw this listing for a two-story house for less than $50,000. I knew I had to jump on the opportunity. It was a long drive, but well worth it. I arrived and was stunned, the house looked to be in pristine condition. I unlocked the front door and stepped inside. The air was musty and stale as if no one had been there for a while. I shrugged it off. I didn’t find it too much of a problem, nothing that some air freshener couldn’t fix. I started unpacking all of my stuff when I first noticed a strange presence. I started looking around, just to confirm I wasn’t losing my mind. I went upstairs and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I continued my search until I reached the basement door. I placed my hand on the door handle but was suddenly overwhelmed with dread. I immediately took my hand off the doorknob. I decided that I wouldn’t go down there until I needed to, at least that’s what thought jumped to mind as I backed away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went back to unpacking my stuff, it took me a good 4, maybe 5 hours to completely have all my stuff packed away. I was exhausted, so I walked up the stairs to the master bedroom. Collapsing on the bed immediately. It felt amazing like I could sleep forever. It only took me about 5-10 minutes before I fell asleep, however. I didn’t stay asleep for too long. It was about 2 hours later that I awoke at midnight on the dot. A strange noise invaded my ears, someone was stomping downstairs. I was taken aback, I slowly stood up, trying not to make much noise as I reached for a nearby bat, I had stashed next to the bed. I got up and made my way to the door, reaching out towards the knob. It seemed right as I touched the doorknob to exit the room, all noises ceased to exist. I had thought I had gone deaf because of the true lack of any noise. I couldn’t even hear my breathing, but perhaps I was holding my breath. I opened the door and walked down the stairs. Everything was still quiet, with the exception now of my ragged breaths. I reached the bottom of the stairs and flicked on the lights, raising my bat high. I was expecting to see someone crouched down but instead was met with nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lowered the bat after taking a thorough look around the bottom floor, making sure I had locked all the doors and windows. Ensuring everything was locked tight, I froze when I turned to see the basement door ajar. I must’ve stayed still for what felt like hours but in reality, it was only a couple of minutes. I silently walked forward, once more holding my breath as I quickly shut the door. I could’ve sworn that the door was shut when I had first looked around. I started catching my breath, I was mentally and physically exhausted from what had occurred. I made my way back up the stairs and entered the bedroom. I placed the bat next to the headboard as I collapsed on the bed, unable to sleep for the rest of the night. Daylight began to take hold of the sky when I finally decided I should get up, no way I was catching any more sleep this night. I went downstairs and began making myself a pot of coffee. I ran through the night in my head once more, I couldn’t shake the fact that the door had been opened slightly. I kept glancing over at the basement door. It was a truly eerie feeling I was getting from that damn door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinishing my coffee, I washed the cup and grabbed my keys from a nearby rack, and left to head to town to the market. Oddly enough I only purchased some coffee for myself the previous day before arriving. The scenery outside was spectacular, the house was surrounded by dense woods with a driveway that was nearly a mile long leading to the main road. I never really understood why people loved living out in the countryside, but it didn’t take too much to convince me. This was the best option for me. I could finally focus on saving money and bettering myself. I arrived at the closest market, waking inside I was met with an employee greeting me. “How’re you doing today, sir?” the employee asked. “I’m doing relatively well, thank you,” I replied, walking past the checkout counter after grabbing a shopping cart.

        "text": "I am now locked in the toilet as my left eye furiously bangs on the door. I am beyond terrified, and I don't think I'll survive much longer,  but if I will, my most important wish is to document the happenings of today.\n\nThe day started as normal until something at the back of my mind told me there was a wrong thing. My sight wasn't as full as it usually was. It wasn't as if one of my eyes was closed, but that some of my sights had disappeared entirely.\n\nI lightly grazed the spot my left eye was supposed to be, but instead of touching eyelashes, there was only bare skin. I ran to the mirror and saw with absolute horror, that there was only skin where my eye was supposed to be. I looked absolutely hideous. \n\nMy appearance was my main worry. Without my good looks, my lover wouldn't love me anymore. I would go home, and onto the bed alone. That, I couldn't stand.\n\nI ran and grabbed my phone, dialling my left eye. The wretched creature wouldn't answer her phone. (I was a male, but my left eye liked the look of men, which either meant that it was gay or female, and since I believe that I am straight and that I share that aspect with my whole body, it must be female.)\n\nAfter the tenth ring, it finally connected. I spat: \"Where are you?\" \n\n\"With my lover. I believe it is time for you and me to separate. I have left you for another man!\"\n\nShe hung up on me before I could get another word in. I couldn't blame her, I was absolutely speechless. It would have taken me another three minutes before I'd be able to formulate a sentence, and that sentence would be: *What?* \n\nPerhaps I'd be fine if my left eye only took the eyeball, but the damn thing took my eyelids, eyelashes, and eyebrows. I realize now that perhaps it believed it had a right to them, as they were named after her. But I was hideous! \n\nI ran to my closet and swung open the doors, I quickly put on clothes. I would find that little piece of shit, and I would force her to come back before I had my first date with my new lover. First impressions were important, and I wasn't going to show up one-eyed.\n\nI leapt and ran down the stairs out of the apartment, out of the door, and onto the bus. I sat there, simmering with fury, for nearly ten minutes, before I glanced backwards. It was eerily silent on the bus, and I wondered if somebody was there with me. Just as I looked, the bus stopped and the doors swung open.\n\nIt was my eye! She sat there, trying to look inconspicuous by browsing her phone . She was staring at that thing. I stood up and made my way towards her, \"you little shit!\"\n\n\"Stop!\" She shrieked and ran out of the bus. I followed behind her. She kept screaming: \"Help me, anybody:\"\n\nI was tackled. A short man with a bald head jerked his shoulder into my stomach. It was painful, forcing my body to freeze, making me grunt, and sending me toppling down into the ground. The man mounted me and said: \n\n\"You're a perv!\" He said. \n\n\"She's mine!\" I said.\n\n\"Women aren't property,\" he stated, disgusted.\n\n\"But she is!\" \n\n\"This is unacceptable,\" he said. \"I am calling the cops.\"\n\n\"Look at what you've done,\" I cried to my eye. She had been standing on my left side, and for obvious reasons, I could not see her. When I shifted my head towards her direction, I saw that the damned rascal had abandoned me. \n\nWhen the cops came, I was given a stern talking-to, a couple of warnings, and a bunch of bad stares. I would have done the same back to them, but that would only have been half as effective. Deciding to stay silent, I waited for them to leave.\n\nWithout a clue where my eye had gone, I wandered around the town, hoping to spot her walking around. Then, I saw her! She was on the palm under a soft cloth tissue of a man. He and his friends stared at it with curiosity.\n\n\"That is my eye!\" I said.\n\n\"I am sorry to inform you, \" he said, \"but I found it on the floor, As I was the one to find it, it is from now on mine!\"\n\n\"False!\" I said. \"Eyes are the property of the body, and my body wants my eye back.\"\n\n\"No, no, I think I'm fine,\" my body whispered.\n\n\"Traitor!\" I spat.\n\n\"Aha,\" the man said, putting my eye in his pocket, and entering a car with the rest of his friends. They were a cocky bunch. But, I had nothing to say. They simply wouldn't hand over my eye, and I thought it was lost when they drove away.\n\nIt was only ten minutes left until my first date with my love, with who I had communicated for over a whole month. But, just as I was about to enter the restaurant I saw my eye approaching the same place. I decided at that moment, that she was certainly mocking me!\n\n\"Oh please,\" she said, as I cornered her. \"I am here to meet my date. Please let me. He is the love of my life.\"\n\nHer words struck a chord with me. That was exactly what I was going to do! I simply couldn't rob her of this opportunity, then I'd be no better than her. She would be better than me, and how could a part be better than a hole? It was simply illogical.\n\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"But, then you come back to me.\n\n\"Thank you so much!\" She said eagerly.\n\nI walked into the restaurant, my eye walking behind me. Then, I took a seat, expectedly waiting for the love of my life to enter. She was a beauty, rich with complexity, and just looking at her told you she was intelligent. She was something I felt could open a whole new world for me.   \n\n\nAnd then my eye sat across me. \n\n\"Get away,\" I said. \"She's about to come.\"\n\n\"I am her,\" she said. \"But you are not him!\"\n\n\"What? You can't be Martha! Martha's a human name.\"\n\n\"And you can't be Jack, that is the name of a handsome man, of which you are not. Furthermore, your name is Eric.\"\n\n\"It is you! I said my name was Eric because I thought Jack was too simplistic.\"\n\n\"Oh please, how could you miss that they're both as simplistic.\"\n\n\"I guess you could hall me half-sighted.\"\n\nThe comment enraged her, and she jumped forward at my throat. I quickly stood up as she smashed against the floor. I turned out and ran away. She tried to chase me, but the optic nerve was stuck in the chair.\n\nAnd that was how I got into my situation.  I am unsure what to do now, but I don't think I will survive.",

        "text": "Ever since I was a child I have experienced otherworldly things. Even as a little boy who was still learning to speak, I remember looking up at the sky and seeing a staircase going up into the thick clouds. The staircase looked ancient like the ones you would see at historical sites carved or made out of rock, aged and blackish. On this staircase I saw people climbing up.\n\nNot too long later I was at my 13th floor balcony of our old apartment and saw two beings male and female on the roof of another apartment next to ours. They were dressed in silver iron suits. The female was climbing upon the back of a flying vehicle on which the male was already seated on. The vehicle had handles or that it appeared similar to a motorcycle before moving out of sight. I remember even at that age I was captivated by that female.\n\nI suffer from sleep paralysis a lot, especially from the age of 15 and I hate it. The worst ones would feel like an electric current to my brain which would leave me drained afterwards. I would then suffer the week with brain fog, low energy and lack of interests in anything.\n\nFrom the age of 18 or 19 I began to be overwhelmed by recurrent dreams, visions and rarely voices. They were all about religions, myths, history and conspiracies. I learned about things from my dreams, visions and voices before I had even read about them. I began to believe that everything was connected or that there is truth in all of them if not most of it. From Gods and myths of different religion whether ancient or modern to mythological figures or characters, \"aliens\", conspiracy theories and what not.\n\nI was always an introvert and withdrew myself from the crowd. But it was obvious at this point that I am different or plain weird and had trouble fitting in society. I am often alone but never feel lonely or that I feel lonely but never alone. It is because of how strange I feel. I do have my family and I cherish them the most.\n\nMy life drastically changed one night and it started with a voice which began speaking to me. Just out of the blue, while I was outside watching fashion models doing their rehearsals on stage. I think it felt feminine and she said, \"look..\" and I looked. What I saw when I looked changed me forever and my life was never the same again. I saw that everything was a lie. It was as if she stripped the whole world and exposed the lies to me. I do not know how to describe this but everything appeared fake to me. The amount of things that are made up and forced upon ourselves as hard truths in which our lives and identities depended on was heart breaking. Everything was a lie. She asked me, \"is this what you think of as great? Is this what you look up to?\"\n\nI was a very motivated and goal driven young man who was going after worldly success and recognition but that night her voice cruely killed my heart and left me aimless, lost and depressed. I left home with tears flowing down my cheek. I knew it was all over for me and I was terrified! My passionate heart was now a dark empty hole and I became merely a lifeless statue of my former self. I withdrew myself from everyone and spent most of my time in my room. This was noticed by my family members and I gave them a hard time in trying to help me recover. They never gave up on me but I was cursed.. I could not fit anywhere. \n\nThe dreams and visions continued and quite rarely voices too. Even though I was born in a different religion, I have by that time grew fond of Jesus Christ because He was my first vision at the age of 18 or 19. But the voice I described came about a year or two later. I guess He had warned me or had come to save me.\n\nSadly, years would pass with me suffering in depression. I let myself go and secretly searched all I could about a question that had often bugged me..who am I? I searched and read about anything that I could learn concerning my dreams and visions. Some of them even felt like they could be my former lifetimes. I have even dreamed about how I had come down to earth and looked for my mother to be born here and just how crazy that sounds!\n\nAmongst the very few names revealed to me in my dreams and visions concerning my identity, one was surprisingly a male voice that came much later. One afternoon as I had gone to take a quick nap, a male voice just spoke saying, \"you are the grandson of_____.\" I had not even fallen asleep, it appeared right after I had shut my eyes. Surprised, I opened my eyes immediately and saw that there was nobody there. I grabbed my cell phone and searched the name that was revealed to me. I was surprised to see that there was indeed a mythological character with such a name. I traced the lineage of that name which would make me (if this is true) a great great great grandson of Zeus, who was the King of the Greek Gods. \n\nI thought it was funny, I mean these myths, they couldn't be real, right? Right?\n\nInevitably, a time came when I was angry that all of these experiences had wasted my time and left me missing out on real life opportunities. I met my school friends many years later and I was embarrassed of myself. They had jobs, cars and some of them their own houses. Some of them had also gotten married. But here I was the loser who had no clue what to say to them about why I had done nothing much with myself. \"Well, actually guys I heard a voice.. and the visions and dreams..,\" no I wasn't going to do that!\n\nI couldn't accept my fate and blamed it all for taking my life away from me. I was angry at God and I was angry at life. Why me? I remembered the female voice from that night and cursed her for ruining the life of a young man. It was clear to me that I needed to fight for my life. I needed to be a responsible and rational man. I needed to participate in my family and society and create myself anew. I must become an established man. And what about my dating life? I had wasted so many opportunities. I began to think that I was possibly suffering from mental health. Perhaps I was delusional or schizophrenic. \n\nI had always prayed to God since this otherworldly experiences took off from the age of 18 or 19. And along the way, I had become fond of some Gods and Goddesses too because I believe they helped me to survive my difficult times. But no one can give back the years that flew by. I just prayed I would at least become an established man instead of living my life in regret.\n\nI had lost a successful fashion modelling career and I took a long time to finally complete my law degree. Thanks to my family who are always supportive and loving. \n\nTo this day I still suffer with the emptiness but the years have taught me to be wise and act smart instead of losing myself on an impulse or emotional downfall. Do what is right instead of following my empty feelings. I still suffer with sleep paralysis but it has reduced. I still experience the dreams and visions but they have lessened also. \n\nI am 38 now and hoping to live a normal life with healthy relationships and career. Jesus Christ has become my Lord and Savior for strong reasons but I do not speak or express this openly. I keep it personal. I do however communicate with or express gratitude to other dieties for their valuable roles in my life. I do not discriminate nor am I disrespectful. Life is bigger than you think. I still do not know everything, neither do you. And I admit to feel a strong connection with Zeus but I still do not know who he truly is, the actual Zeus. I just hope it is not The Devil pulling his tricks on me all this while haha! Believe me when I say, that whatever evil thing is possibly real. \n\nI hope to give my all to my family and help those I can along the way. I really hope I can be a useful man to society in a way that I contribute to their wellbeing. I know that I will feel most meaningful in such a valuable role.\n\nI have stopped asking who I am. It does not matter who I am. It only matters what I do. And when there are so many people suffering out there praying for help, it is wrong for me to sit and entertain such thoughts. I am not special and will not waste my time. We are all in this together. Take care and thank you for your time.",

        "text": "          I woke up at 3AM to an amber alert notification on my phone. Struggling to find my phone, I turn on the lamp on my night stand to find it on the floor. The amber alert notification says \"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON. PLEASE FALL ASLEEP AND REFRAIN FROM LOOKING OUTSIDE.\" I was a little freaked out by this. What could possibly be wrong with looking at the moon? I became even more confused when I found out I had thousands of other notifications. My eyes grew wider, and I awakened more. I unlocked my phone to find WhatsApp have a little red circle above it saying \"99+.\" All of my social media apps had over a hundred notifications.\n          One of the notifications had said \"Look at the moon. It's beautiful outside.\" Must've been someone who had gotten the notification, and wanted to creep someone out. That's when I found out another notification had said \"Look at the moon. It's beautiful outside.\" That's weird. Another person said the said the same thing. I scrolled through all of the notifications. To my surprise, it had all said the same thing. \"Look at the moon. It's beautiful outside.\"\n          I was freaked out. I wanted to look outside out of curiosity, but I was so creeped out, I didn't. Maybe my phone was hacked. I decided to text my friend to see if he was in the same scenario I was in. However, when I opened up his DMs, all of the previous messages were gone, and there was only one thing on screen. \"Look at the moon. It's beautiful outside.\" I was bewildered. I had to be hacked, right?\n          I texted him anyway. \"Dude, what's going on? Did you get that amber alert notification too? About a minute later, he texted back. \"Look at the moon. It's beautiful outside.\" That made me feel less like my phone was hacked. The amber alert had told me to just fall back asleep, and so I did. Well, I didn't, but I tried to. I felt haunted from those notifications. I just couldn't sleep.\n          Finally, I got another notification. \"It's the moon thing, isn't it?\" I mumbled under my breath. When I opened my phone, I was surprised to see a notification from my other friend, we'll call him Dave, texted me. It wasn't the moon thing, it was him saying \"Hey dude, you up? I got a weird amber alert notification and thousands of people are texting me.\" My eyes grew and I quickly sat up to text him back.\n          \"Yeah, you getting the moon thing too???\" I texted quickly.\n          He responded with \"Yeah, I haven't looked at the moon. Have you?\"\n          I responded, \"No, I don't want to. I'm curious though.\"\n         He replied \"Don't look at it. I don't know what could happen, but it's certainly a bad thing.\" I decided to turn on my lights, and close the curtains just incase.\n         \"You know I'm I curious guy,\" I texted, \"I feel like I have to.\"\n         He kept telling me, \"Don't look at it. It could be bad.\" He knows that I'm a curious guy. I'm also a risky person. He's also a really non-serious. He always dared me to do these risks, and sees me as a daredevil, which is, what I see myself as also. However, this time, he isn't. That's how you know he's dead serious.\n         \"What could possibly happen if I looked at it? Is it so bright it'll blind my eyes? There's no light out there!\" I texted. \"This time I'm serious.\" He replied. I couldn't take it. My curiosity was beaming. I turned of the phone. I set it down. I walked to the window. Opened the blinds. Opened the window, and peeked my head out, looking up. \n\n          The moon was beautiful. A pretty blue and yellow color made it glow, it was almost rainbow. The moon was bigger and brighter than usual. It was the most beautiful thing I've seen in my life. My phone kept pinging. I walked to it, with a huge grin and unfocused eyes. It was Dave, saying \"DUDE WHY ARENT YOU RESPONDING. DID YOU LOOK AT THE MOON?!\" I responded, texting him back using nothing but my index finger, key by key. I said; \"Look at the moon. It's beautiful outside.\"",

        "text": "Alright, I dont really post on reddit often and dont know how to begin by just saying i was inspired to write what happened to me when i read the post below and thought it sounded pretty similar. I generally am lazy so I'll do my best to actually tell you the full account of what happened.  \n\n\n [LINK TO POST I READ THIS MORNING AFTER MY EXPERIENCE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ir1au/a_couple_hours_ago_i_heard_somebody_talking/)\n\nSo this happened about 9pm AEST last night for me. (its 3pm as i type this).\n\nI was sitting in my room watching a random youtube video and browsing on my phone and I heard this sort of distant screaming sound, only not too distant. And I am pretty sure now that I think about it that I have heard it before, but I always thought it was a couple cats fighting or a really young kid being a really young kid about their vegetables or something, and because i disregarded it I never like, stopped what i was doing or watching to actually open my window and listen properly.   \nThis time, it just sounded so... like gutteral and deep and disgusting. Like as if someone was being tortured or something i didn't really know what to make of it, I haven't heard anyone scream like that in my life. Anyways a few minutes go by and it keeps going on and the youtube video is still playing and my window is still closed but i can still hear it intermittently like once every minute or two there would be a long, 30-50 second sort of scream/belch and it sounded just right fucked up. \n\neventually i start to think \"what if a kid is actually being abused or something?\" and i cant really shake the thought of the guilt I'd feel if something did happen and i didnt report anything so i resolved to listen in and try to find out what it was. Eventually turned down the volume of the video, walked into the corner of my room where the window is. (Newtown is a pretty urban place, my apartment is above a restaurant and theres a very narrow alleyway in between my building and the next building over which looks kind of derelict and super suspect)  \nI heard it more clearly through the window and I could pretty much confirm it was a person, they kind of sounded very close and underneath my building, my best guess is they were in the alleyway next to the building and the echo was sort of playing off the walls or something I dont really know).  \nI opened the window, which is fairly old and it made a loud noise. I didnt really care cause I still wanted to just listen in on the voice, but it definitely heard me. This time it was much closer and it was saying something in maybe some language I dont know, I'll leave that for the reddit detectives.\n\nIt sounded just evil to be perfectly honest and I was like \"yeah, nah thats enough for me thanks\" and i closed the window and walked away to my desk a bit shook. I thought about calling a friend and just telling him what happened but the more I thought about telling him the more I realised that either:  \nA. he wasnt going to believe me  \nor  \nB. even if he did he wouldn't really ever understand what I heard or how spooky it was. I wouldn't be able to emulate it\n\nOn top of that my mates would probably take the piss and make fun of me lol. So i was like 'fuck it, I'm gonna try and get a recording to show them' and so I did.\n\nLet me explain what you'll hear and what I linked below:\n\nImmediately after I was spooked I sat back in my chair and put the youtube video volume up to mask my own noise cause it sounded very close, and I was legit fkn spooked to the shithouse. And that's when I thought to get the recording. What I did was I opened the voice memo app on my phone and walked over to the windowsill and placed my phone on the windowsill with the microphone side of my phone raised and up against the window. I didnt open the window again cause I was like fuck that, that's how people die in movies. I pressed record, backed away from the window and walked over to my computer desk and lowered the video volume (that I was hoping was disguising my presence a little) and then literally walked out of my bedroom.  \n\n\nThis is all genuine, really happened, and my friend who I ended up calling is coming over tonight around 8 to see if we hear anything again. Just want to get your thoughts and/or similar experiences or, if we're lucky, any translations or insights into what the fuck I heard last night.  \n\n\n[Audio Recording - Voice in Newtown, Sydney](https://soundcloud.com/jeremy-nunez-11/king-st-newtown-voice?si=b3a14980ff4f4e08bbcb9fd35116f85c&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing)",

        "text": "[Finishing up as quickly as I could in the restroom](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/111t1ee/the_last_time_i_rode_on_an_airplane_there_were/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I stepped out and scampered back to my seat. I put my earbuds in, hoping the sounds of 90's grunge music might drown out the flight attendant's voice in my head. It didn't.\n\nI looked out through the window, spotting... Well, that was just it, I spotted nothing. I leaned forward to look a bit closer, and there was nothing. Everything was one giant, gray cloud around the plane. *Great,* I thought, a *thunderstorm, and we're right in the middle of it. Fan-fuckin'-tastic.*\n\nI closed my eyes and sighed. *Calm yourself, you're just--*\n\n\"Running?\" My eyes snapped open. The voice was soft, monotone, mechanical almost, coming from the seat behind me. I turned to look behind me and saw this little girl, couldn't have been a day over 9 or 10, sitting alone who, like everyone else on this creepy ass flight, was staring forward with the blankest, deadest stare I've ever seen from a person. Lifeless, emotionless, mechanical.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I asked. She continued staring at me with two doll like eyes.\n\n\"You're running from something, aren't you?\" I frowned at her.\n\n\"What're you talking about?\" I started looking around. \"And where're your--\"\n\n\"They're gone, too, Rick.\" My mouth fell open. My heart froze.\n\n\"H-How do you know my name?\"\n\n\"We all know who you are, Rick. You're running away, just like I did.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Of course you don't.\" I raised my eyebrow. For a moment, I couldn't tell whether or not it was a good idea to keep trying to talk to her. I'm not saying that I was scared of her hurting me or anything, obviously, but something about *what* she was saying (or at the very least *implying*) sounded to me like something I wouldn't *want* to know.\n\nPart of this is that fact that, at least from what I could see, she wasn't *trying* to be scary or anything like that. Nothing about what she said sounded like she was trying to exaggerate or even make some sort of shock statement. No, she *meant* it, every bit of it.\n\n\"And to answer your question, they're not here. I won't be seeing them for a long time.\"\n\n\"Your parents?\" I asked stupidly. She nodded. \"Wh-What--\"\n\n\"I told you already. I tried to run away, just like you are now.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I'm running from something?\"\n\n\"I can see it all over your face. You're running away from something. That's why you took this flight, isn't it? To get away?\"\n\n\"I-I...\"\n\n\"You lost something, didn't you?\" I closed my mouth. Figuring by now that, through *some* means I couldn't understand, this little girl knew just about everything about me and so I decided that I'd just let her do the majority of the talking for herself. \"Was it someone you loved? It was for me.\"\n\nI sank back into my seat, hoping to send the message that I wasn't interested in talking anymore. It didn't convey, and so I could still hear the girl continue. \"Was it someone in your family?\" She asked in a monotone, droning sort of voice. A voice that you'd expect to hear from a vintage audio cassette, cracked and sort of fuzzy; unclear. \"For me, it was my little sister.\"\n\nI had just fitted one of my earbuds back in and was in the act of fitting the other one when I heard her add, \"She burned up and was gone.\" This made me freeze up; every joint, every muscle, all seizing up at the same time while my heart jackhammered away at my chest.\n\n*\"Burned up\"... \"Gone\"...*\n\n\"Wh-What do you--\"\n\n\"She used to be so happy until that day. We used to always run around the neighborhood, playing together after school. It was always fun with her.\"\n\nMy mind immediately took me through every memory I had stored of me and Irene. Every cherished moment; good, bad, and everything weird in between, from when I'd met her in high school to the day I lost her. Every feature of her face, every tender word she spoke to me, it all started unloading on my brain. It was heavy, overwhelming almost.\n\n\"One day, I remember,\" she continued, \"we had just gotten off the bus and were walking the rest of the way home and I saw that she looked depressed. I asked her what was wrong and she told me \"Everything's gonna end.\"\n\n*\"... All coming to an end...\"*\n\n\"We went home that day and she wouldn't even play with me. When suppertime came, she never came down and when we looked in her room, she was gone. The only thing she left behind was a large black spot in the middle of her floor.\"\n\nMy eyes doubled in size. *Black spot... Just like..*\n\nI rose up and looked behind my seat again. She was still staring dead at me. \"You... You saw this happen, too?\" She blankly nodded. My heartbeat abruptly ceased. *Then I wasn't crazy...*\n\n\"We all have, Rick.\" she said. She pointed to another passenger on the opposite side of us, a couple rows down. \"See him?\" I nodded. \"He lost his brother like that.\"\n\n\"How do *you* know this?\"\n\n\"It wasn't an accident, you picking this flight. It wasn't natural, what happened, either.\" Her head turned to look out of her window -- admittedly the first time I'd seen anybody *but me* on this flight look anywhere other than forward. My mouth hung agape for a moment.\n\n*How does she know all of this? How does she know me or what happened to Irene?* I passed a brief glance around at the other passengers. *How could it have happened to them?*\n\n\"Because it's not new, either.\" chimed the little girl, not looking away from the glass.\n\n\"What? H-How are you--\"\n\n\"Not. New.\" I went silent again while she sighed and said, \"This has been going on for over 100 years or more.\"\n\n\"Wait, huh? The hell do you mean?\"\n\n\"Look out the window.\" I turned to face it. Outside of the window, the sky appeared colorless. It was as though the plane had flown into a nimbus so thick that it may as well have been a large pillow, smothering the plane on all sides.\n\n\"Wh-What... I-I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Of course you don't. No one usually does. Blind men often don't know they're blind until the truth forces their eyes to open, just to see the truth...\" There was a, while dramatic, somewhat sinister pause that she made hang in the air for a solid half a minute before finishing with, \"That is nothing at all.\"\n\n\"What? Look, I'm sorry, c-can you just explain what this is? I-I mean, where the hell even are we? Why's everyone so... So...\"\n\n\"Lost?\" she asked, looking down from the window. I froze, then began laughing. Nothing was funny, but at the same time it was funny, if you take my meaning. One of those, \"Well, when you put it THAT way...\" type deals.\n\n\"Yeah... Yeah, maybe that is a good way to put it, ain't it?\"\n\n\"It's the truth.\" She was finally looking at me again. Her deadpanned face seemed to fall even further into an expression of sadness. If you could've seen the face of this little girl in that instant, you would've seen the one true definition of the word \"hopeless\". It was the same look Irene gave me that afternoon. \"We're all lost. We're all running.\"\n\n\"From what? What're you talking about here?\"\n\n\"Why did you board this flight, Ricky?\"\n\n\"To... To get away for a while.\"\n\n\"Get away from what?\" At first, I said nothing. I couldn't see what this little brat was going on about. I wanted her to either giggle and tell me all of this was a joke or start making some sort of sense. I got neither. Instead, she just stared at me expectantly.\n\n\"To get away from my hometown for a while, like I just said.\"\n\n\"Why, though, Ricky? What was so wrong with your little town?\" I groaned.\n\n\"Look, kid, I'm serious when I say this. Just leave me alone if you're not going to just tell me what's going on.\" She kept gazing directly in my eyes, using them, somehow, to convey a strange, yet oddly familiar, feeling. Numbness. Emptiness.\n\n*What in the... What's happening, why am I feeling like this? Where is this place, how'd we get here?*\n\n\"Not by accident, Ricky.\" She got up from her seat and walked toward the back of the cabin. I got up from my seat then and started after her.\n\n\"Hey, wait!\" She ignored me. Her lead was a good few feet ahead of me, yet moving so fast that I thought for sure she'd just disappear all the way to the back before I could even blink. Suddenly, though, she stopped and turned to one of the passengers to her right.\n\n\"See him?\" She asked, raising her arm to point at the man in the seat. \"You see anything wrong?\" I looked at the man. He stared forward like everyone else -- though with an admittedly even less emotional expression than the rest.\n\n\"What about him?\" I asked. \"He looks fine to me.\"\n\n\"Really? \"Fine?\" She cocked her head to the side. \"This looks like someone who's \"fine\" to you?\"\n\n\"Okay, so he looks down in the dumps, but what's that got to do with--\"\n\n\"He looks dead, doesn't he?\" I exchanged glances back and forth between the two. He stared forward, completely oblivious to either of us.\n\n\"I-I guess.\"\n\n\"Well he isn't, but he's not far from it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Look here.\" she said, pointing to the man's chest where I saw a hole growing in the center of. My eyes grew.\n\n\"The hell?\" I asked, shocked. \"What *is* that?\"\n\n\"It's what happens to us all.\" She turned to face me again, unbuttoning her shirt a bit to reveal a hole in her own chest. \"You have it, too. It's the feeling of emptiness. The pain of loss.\"\n\n\"What do you mean \"I have it\"? I don't have a--\" I stopped, realizing as I passed my hands over my chest that there *was* something off. Lifting up my shirt, I found to my horror that she was right. *Holy shit, a fucking HOLE is in my chest! How? Why? What is--*\n\n\"This is what it feels like to feel nothing.\" The girl chimed in.\n\n\"Wait, what does that mean? And how do you keep knowing what I'm--\"\n\n\"I should know, Ricky-boy. It's my fault you're on this flight to begin with.\" My breath caught in my throat.\n\n\"Wait, what? Who... Who *are* you?\" She stared at me, expressing both numbness, as well as expectance. A look that told me she was disappointed I didn't know this sooner. In all honesty, I was telling myself the same thing. \"I-Irene? B-But...\"\n\nShe held up her hand, silencing me. \"You remember what I told you, Ricky, about how it would all end?\"\n\n\"Y-Yeah... I do.\"\n\n\"Well, here we are, at the end.\" She waved her hands around the cabin.\n\n\"I don't understand, you're saying the world's going to end?\"\n\n\"Yes. For you, leastways.\"\n\n\"Wait, what? What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"You don't see the beauty of the world anymore, do you?\" I looked again out the window. Dull, gray, lifeless skies surrounded the plane on all sides. \"There's no color to you, is there?\"\n\n\"N-No, but--\"\n\n\"And no, those aren't clouds, hon. You're seeing the world, but not the world you want to see. You're seeing the world the way that only those who are lost do.\"\n\n\"Lost?\"\n\n\"Empty\". \"Dead inside\". \"Numb\". Take your pick, they all mean the same thing. All of them are the products of a lost soul. It happens when we lose something we cherished above all else in the world.\"\n\n\"H-How do you know this? How come you never--\"\n\n\"Because you weren't lost. You wanted purpose in your life, you wanted a reason to keep going, so I was given to you. I was able to give you a purpose, while filling the hole in my own soul, for a time anyway.\"\n\n\"But... But how? I mean, when did you--\"\n\nHer voice got deeper, sounding more like her adult self as she said, \"It was Winter. I was about 13 and Penelope was 11. Through everything, good times and bad, whether we were hanging out or fighting with each other, the two of us were each other's best friend. It was snowing out and we decided to go sledding.\"\n\nHer stare returned to the window. Mine redirected to the man. I began to see the hole spread out more and more, engulfing and dissolving more and more of him away. The more it did, the more I noticed that his body began to glow a distinct sort of golden, orangish color. \"I went first,\" she continued, \"Then it was Penelope's turn, but something went wrong. She ended up going much farther than I did, far past the tree line and into the woods. She never came back out, and even after 6 months or more of searching, she was never found.\"\n\nThe hole had swallowed most of the man's chest and was now working its way up and around his neck. I started feeling the familiar warmth coming from him, the same as what I'd felt from Irene before. \"That's when my soul became lost.\"\n\n\"Wh-Why are you telling me this? Why am I seeing all of this? What's happening to me?\"\n\nShe turned back to me with that same stare she'd given me that day on the couch and recited, \"Have you not heard a word I said?\"\n\n\"I have, but it makes no sense. I-I mean, what happened to you? How are you here, why are you a child, why--\"\n\n\"I tried to run away, just like you are, just like *they* are.\" She pointed to the man again, who was now glowing much brighter than a minute ago.\n\n\"Wh-What's gonna--\"\n\n\"He's going to cease to exist. The world has ended for them, and so now he's going to go with it.\"\n\n\"Cease to exist?!\" I exclaimed. \"H-How do we stop it?\"\n\n\"*You* don't. The only ones that can stop that are themselves. They've lost their worlds, *we've* lost our worlds, and now it's time for us to go away, too.\"\n\n\"But wait, what about you? How are you still here?\"\n\nThis was when, for the first time, I watched something akin to genuine sadness mold into her small face as she said in her adult voice, \"Because of you, Ricky-boy.\" She came up and tenderly put her hand to my chest. Immediately, the hole in the center of my chest began to slowly open itself wider.\n\n\"I told you, as long as you live, I'll always be with you, holding your soul.\" A feeling of numbness spread throughout my body from my chest. \"You've been trying to run from me, just like I was running from my sister. You want to get away because you know you can't let go.\"\n\nMy body felt hollow all of a sudden. All I could think to do was stand there, still as stone, staring slack-jawed at Irene. I couldn't feel anything, inside or out. The hole expanded, swallowing most of my stomach and already beginning to creep down my legs. \"Because you won't let go, you've become lost like the rest of us.\"\n\n\"What's going to happen to me?\" I asked. There was considerably less emotion in my voice than there should've been. The emptiness was spreading, I realized, hollowing me out mind, body, and spirit.\n\n\"The same thing that happened to me.\" She replied, her voice noticeably cracking. \"The world, life itself, will end for you. You won't exist anymore and you will fade from everyone's memory, along with the rest of us.\"\n\nI would've lost it, hearing this, under normal circumstances. I'd have flown into a panic, trying to undo this, but the thing was... I didn't necessarily want to. I wasn't afraid, mostly, of course, due to the inability to feel at all, but also because a small part of me, the part of me that was consuming me, came to the conclusion that, at least the nightmares would end, right? I would be able to free myself of her, right?\n\nHell, from a more optimistic perspective, this part of me presented the hope that, whatever happens, maybe I could be reunited with Irene again. We'd be together beyond even time...\n\nRight?\n\n*\"As long as you live...\"*\n\nHer words echoed, bringing my naive fantasy crashing back to a grim reality. If I were no longer here, If I no longer existed, then neither would she. I was the only reason she was still here now. Why she'd been around past the age of 13. Why she wasn't completely lost. I had kept her whole, despite me being the downer type of us both. I was the reason she wanted to shine.\n\nI began to feel tears sting my eyes. \"I-Ir-Irene...\"\n\n\"I know you don't want to, Ricky, and I can't blame you if you don't, but please, stop running and let go.\"\n\n\"I-I can't... How do I--\"\n\n\"It's not too late, you just have to let go of me.\"\n\n\"You mean forget about you?\"\n\n\"No, not forget. Detach. Accept the truth.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"That I'm gone. I know it will hurt you, but this will destroy us both if you don't.\" More and more, feeling returned to my body, bringing with it a sense of something heavy. Something crushing. Something suffocating almost. \"I love you, Rick. I never stopped, and I wish I could've stayed. I wish I could've been stronger. But you have always been the strongest of us, and I need you to be strong again now that I'm gone.\"\n\nThe hole in my chest closed up again as I said, my breath shaking and broken in tears, \"I love you, too, Irene.\" Her other hand was then placed onto my chest and I watched the little girl in front of me transform into the familiar form of my beloved wife. Her body shone with an ivory aura that both illuminated the dreary cabin surrounding us, as well as overshadow everything and everyone around us and her face welcomed me with her warmest, most tender smile.\n\nIn the short space of time this occurred, there were no sounds; from me, her, or anything else around. It was me and her, amid a beautiful white space. Serenity...\n\nHer hands moved tenderly from my chest and up and around my neck. My hands reflexively move around her waist, gently pulling her closer to me. Then, at last, we kiss and it was like every ounce of every emotion I'd kept bottled up channeled through my lips and into hers. She was taking all of my sorrow, all of my grief, my misery, and taking into her. It was my relief. Her way of holding me for comfort the same way I had her that day.\n\nI didn't feel her pull away. The only thing I *did* feel was an intense pain throughout my body as I woke to find myself sprawled out on the summit of a mountain. My head was throbbing madly and my vision was little more than a giant cloud. That said, I realized something then. I could distinguish the color of the grass on the mountain around me.\n\nNot only that, but I looked up and was instantly blinded by the light of the sun. The colors, the heat, the life around me, it was all normal again. When my eyes adjusted a bit more, I found that hunks of the plane around me, scattered everywhere. I attempted to sit up, which took a bit of effort but I managed to do, before looking around to see if any of the other passengers had survived whatever the hell apparently happened while I was blacked out.\n\nThat's when I found, to my shock, that there was no trace of anyone else at all. I didn't know what to expect, really, but I would've figured there would've at least been one or two of their bodies, or maybe parts of it, *something* to signify that they were on the plane. But there was nothing. Only me.\n\nStruggling to my feet, I managed to wade through, staggering, until I found the discarded cockpit. I picked up the dangling radio, again, not really knowing what the hell I was supposed to expect, and began trying to buzz *somebody* for help. I was a bit amazed then when I began to hear the chopping of helicopter blades from outside. When I went back out, there it was, a rescue helicopter. I waved 'em down and from there, I was lifted off the mountain and to the hospital in the next closest town.\n\nI spent at least a week in the hospital before I was let go, having miraculously (a term that every nurse, surgeon, and orderly at the hospital repeatedly used to the point that I now find the word annoying, despite being the most accurate in my case), sustained no major injuries. In that time, I found out that the chopper came after the pilot supposedly made a distress call of some sort before the line went completely dead and they couldn't reestablish contact.\n\nThe official story is that Flight 249 entered turbulent weather and was struck by a bolt of lightning, bringing it to the mountain. Obviously, that never explained what happened with the other passengers, including the pilot who made the call that saved my life, and I don't think there'll ever be a definitive answer on paper. I've seen internet searches about \"The missing passengers of Flight 249\" and theories as to what happened. I won't go into them here, but suffice to say, they're completely inaccurate, as well as proof of what she'd told me on the plane.\n\nIn each of these \"theories\", one thing always stands out to me. None of the passengers are ever named except me. In other words, despite being a commercial airline, despite the fact that there should've been a flight list with names, none are ever mentioned. In other words, they're as good as nonexistent, speculated about only because of the fact that I alone was found. When asked for my version of the story, I fed them the line that everything was fine until I went to sleep, only to wake up on the mountain. Not the best attempt at a lie, mind you, but I knew they wouldn't believe me about Irene, about the end of everyone's worlds and all. They didn't before...\n\nThis was all two weeks ago. I came back home after leaving the hospital and for the past two weekends, I've taken to hiking the mountain where I was going to propose to Irene. I know you probably expected me to become a hermit for a while after something like what I've written -- trust me, I get it -- but I understood why I couldn't do that. It was that kind of life that almost costed me my existence as a whole. Almost costed Irene's, too.\n\nThinking back to the plane, I realized what she meant. I'd gotten on the plane because I couldn't handle life here at home without her, so I tried to run away to forget. In doing so, I almost couldn't stop it from eating me whole, the same way it did to her all those years ago. She saved me, though, got me to be strong, like she always had and I could keep her memory alive, happily, instead of drowning myself in it.\n\nThis last weekend, coming up to the spot on the mountain where she'd disappeared three years ago, I reached into my pocket and pulled out the ring I'd meant to give her. I'd never gotten rid of it, always carrying it with me. Taking it out of the box, I placed it on the spot where she was.\n\n\"I love you, Irene. Now and forever, though heaven and through hell. I am the best man I can be because of you. The only things I can say to that are thank you, and... Will you marry me?\"",

        "text": "It was a little overcast, but it was still a beautiful summer day. I was with a group of close friends who had planned a boat trip to celebrate Steve’s birthday. There were 6 of us, including Steve, and we had all been looking forward to this day for weeks.\n\nAs we set out, with Mike driving the boat, the sun occasionally peeked out from behind the clouds, casting its warm rays over the ocean. The water was calm, with small ripples formed by the light breeze. We chatted excitedly as we got comfortable, turned up the stereo and cracked open some beers on the boat, ready to start our adventure.\n\nWe had packed everything we needed for the day, including food and drinks, fishing gear, sunscreen, and hats. We were all in high spirits, laughing and joking around, as we headed towards a spot where we hoped to catch some fish.\n\nWe turned the stereo down once we reached the fishing spot, so as not to scare off the fish. The sound of the waves and the gentle rocking of the boat was soothing and calming. We all took turns fishing, enjoying the beers and the fun of being out on the water. Mike and Steve even took a quick dip in the cool water, enjoying the refreshing feeling. \n\nAround 4pm, I thought we should start planning our return trip.\n\n“Hey Mike, you happy to take us back in soon?” I asked, knowing full well he was the only one with a boat licence.\n\n“Yeah, I’m good. Give me five to finish this beer off and bring my line in” he replied.\n\nI nodded, then turned my attention to the stereo. I had noticed the music stopped and there was just some strange static coming through the speakers. I wasn’t sure how long it had been like, we had been a bit loud, laughing and carrying on quite boisterously, so I didn't think too much of it. I figured it was just a temporary glitch, and I just turned it off.\n\nMike finished up his beer and pulled his line in, then made sure everyone else had done the same. \n\n“Hey Matt, can you take my rod for me, I’ll get the boat started up and we can get out of here”\n\n“No problems” I said as I grabbed his rod from him.\n\nMike headed into the cockpit as I started to dismantle the rod.\n\n“What the hell?” Mike said, more to himself than us. We all perked our heads up and moved over to him.\n\n“What’s up?” Steve asked, and Mike just pointed to the GPS. The GPS system on the boat was acting erratically. It was jumping all over the place, and it was impossible to tell exactly where we were. \n\nThat’s when the stereo turned up on volume, and it was now picking up weird sounds, almost like an alien language.\n\nMike grabbed the wheel with one hand and turned the key with the other. Nothing. He tried again, and again. Not even a click. The boat’s engine was dead, and we were just floating in the water.\n\nWe tried to rationalize what was happening, thinking that maybe it was just a product of our imagination or that we were just tired from the day's activities. However, deep down, we all knew that something wasn't right.\n\nSuddenly, a bright light appeared in the sky, hovering above the boat. It was so bright that we had to shield our eyes. We watched in disbelief as the light grew brighter, and a massive UFO appeared, descending towards us.\n\nA beam of light from the UFO enveloped the boat, and we found ourselves being lifted into the air, paralyzed with fear. The strange occurrences we had experienced earlier suddenly made sense.\n\nWe were being abducted by aliens.\n\nAs the UFO lifted us off the boat, we were completely helpless. We felt as if we were floating in space, with nothing to hold onto, and no control over what was happening to us. We were beamed onboard the craft, and as we were brought inside, we saw strange beings with large, black eyes and long, spindly limbs.\n\nWe were then subjected to a series of medical exams and experiments that seemed to last for hours. The aliens poked and prodded at us, examining every inch of our bodies. We felt like we were nothing more than lab rats, helpless and alone. We couldn't communicate with the beings, and they showed no signs of understanding our language or our distress.\n\nThe examinations were terrifying and invasive, and we could feel ourselves being tested in ways we couldn't even imagine. It was as if they were trying to learn everything they could about us. The experience was traumatic, and we were paralyzed, not only with fear, but chemically, unable to do anything to stop what was happening. We couldn’t scream, couldn’t move – the only thing we could do is shed tears, and that we did.\n\nThe pain and terror we felt during the abduction was unbearable, but what the aliens did to Steve was beyond our worst nightmares. They singled him out, and we could only watch helplessly as they subjected him to the most unspeakable torture.\n\nFirst, they peeled his skin off his entire body, leaving him raw and exposed. We could see the horror on his face as he realized what was happening to him. It was as if he was being flayed alive, and he couldn't even scream from the excruciating pain.\n\nThen, the aliens inserted long needles into his exposed muscles, causing him to convulse and writhe in agony. It was unbearable to watch, and we could only imagine the torture he was going through. We could see the tears streaming down his face, and the look of sheer terror in his eyes. It was clear that he was suffering in ways that we couldn't even begin to comprehend.\n\nWe were completely helpless to do anything, and we couldn't even offer Steve any comfort or words of encouragement. It was as if we were all trapped in a nightmare, unable to wake up and escape from the horror that was unfolding before our eyes.\n\nAs the days passed, we lost track of time, and we began to feel like we would never see our homes again. The aliens continued to study us, testing our physical and mental limits. We felt like we were being pushed to our breaking point, and we weren't sure if we would ever make it back to Earth.\n\nThen, one day, we woke up on the boat, dazed and disoriented. Initially, we couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. But slowly we regained control over our bodies again, and we all burst into tears, seeking comfort from one another after the torment we had just endured. Was it even real? Was it a dream? A hallucination?\n\nI could only pray that it was, because as I looked at the terrified faces of my friends, I realized one face was missing. Steve. Steve never returned. We never spoke of the abduction, afraid that no one would believe our story. Instead, we told the police that Steve fell overboard in a drunken accident and was taken by a shark. It seemed like a preferable fate for Steve, and I hoped that his torment was over and that the aliens had allowed him to die. \n\nI fear, however, that is not the case, because ten minutes ago my stereo started playing up, and through the static sounds, I swear I could make out Steves tormented screams. And I think they have come back for me.",

        "text": "I took my last breath, surrounded by my church family and real. The air was so light as I drew it in that one last time.  The sad smiles and few tears told me I would be missed by at least the church members who had been with me these last few months. I'd left them everything. The church that is. Not the vultures I'd called my children and their godless choices. \n\nNo. My riches would go to God, and to God I go for my riches in Heaven.  Them I exhaled onto a warm sunny road, stretching from one horizon to the other.  A crossroads. And from the south came a well dressed man, whistling as the wheat blew beside him. \n\nAs he approached me, he smiled. It was kind and warm.  God, you really did make us in your image didn't you? I thought, smiling back. I felt so young again.  College, my life's golden years, that was the body I had hoped to rise to glory in.\n\n\"Welllll...\" came the long drawl of a South Carolina accent from the man. His eyes... they were the only thing unsettling I now seemed to notice. They were golden, yes, like how I thought God would look. But these were.. inhuman. \"That starin is no way to greet an old friend.\" That voice, there was a heat now and I suddenly noticed a joint lit and hanging slack from his lips.  \n\n\"Old f-friend?\" I'd done so much that God was friend, not judge or creator? \n\n\"Course!\" Came the twang as a flask was handed my way. Southern Comfort, this had basically been a replacement for my blood for a while.  It'd been liver failure in the end that took me. But this was Heaven, so I was cured and could drink what I wanted! \n\nI smiled back thoroughly. \"This certainly takes me back!\" The man laughed, but this was not warm.  He was laughing at a different joke only he knew.  \"Doesn't it though?\" He nodded, smoke bouncing in smoke rings above him. \"Those were our prime days eh?\" From his pocket he slipped an all too familiar silver powder box and mirror.  I hadn't seen it in 60 years. He snorted, then popped in a $100 bill, rolled and ready to the powder on the lid.\n\nThose eyes settled back on me. I settled back on them. And they were malevolent for a moment. Snake eyes.\n\n\"Catchin on now, eh church man?\" His accent was no longer the warm hospitable South, but the scorching heat of the Badlands. \"You can dress yourself up however you like, sing different songs, even give all your money to that Sunday plate. But deep down, you knew who you were spose' to meet today.\"\n\nI took another deep drink of the Southern Comfort, likely the last I'd ever have.  I did it to steady the shaking. A deep breath helped more, now that we're being honest. \"I knew.  I knew when I felt Mags take her last breath.\" \n\nHe nodded. Slow. Agonizingly slow. He took a long drag and blew out a perfect pentagram.  Then he smiled again. It felt warm again. \"Wellll....\"\n\nThe Devil was ready to take me to my end. But he really did feel like an old friend as he handed me the last bump before we walked.  \"You...\" I paused \"you aren't as evil as the priests make you seem.\" \n\nHe chuckled, it was a real one too. The Devil clapped me on the shoulder as we started down the road back South. \"You're funny church man.  I'll tell what real evil is though,\" he drawled through a drag. \"The people who need the Me to exist to just be decent to others.\"\n\nWe walked to the end of the road in silence. Forever felt like an afternoon and longer than it was all in one.  At the end was Mags. With a smile, a knife, the key to my eternal Hell. I knew she was in Heaven.",

        "text": "  \n\n  \n\nHave you ever wondered what happens after you die? I would bet many of you have, I’d even bet some amount of money since it doesn’t matter anyways.\n\nWhat I’m attempting to get to is I found out, it has been my goal since I was a little boy to find what happened after I would die, later in my life I did many things I deemed unnecessary until I started with science.\n\nMany, if not all deemed my methods unstable, unethical. I, however didn’t care. The cost for knowledge is something that can’t be reached, so I had to move to across the world from my town in Ohio to a country that would allow my research though i won’t name it here.\n\nI did many experiments leading to the bettering of humanity if they would listen to me! I saw the effects of a child raised with no contact from anyone, I saw what odd drugs did to dogs and people and many, many more.\n\nBut it all led to the key months of finding what would happen, I was in my small lab made of brick and clay soft dust sprinkling every surface, I scooted through trash and random metal pieces to a splintered wooden desk with a large metal machine pressing all its weight onto my poor table.\n\nFrom a bent, rusty cabinet I pulled files I admittedly stole from others through my journey through many North American and European countries, I canned through rubbing the dust off of the small plastic tags to look at the names settling on one named ‘plan de la machine de la mort’ I got it from France roughly translating to a death machine blueprint.\n\nTo my knowledge it was a machine that was supposed to track when one really died, but it failed and they never managed to get it to work. It was a similar machine to the one I had in front of me with screws jamming a out and jagged metal covered in dust.\n\nHopefully I would be able to piece it together with all the many papers I had and the many years I have dedicated to this. One of the three papers was labeled ‘what happens after death?’ I got from Wales long ago. Lastly, I had one, possibly the hardest one for me to get my hands on though most of them were easy because they yielded not many results alone, they were just puzzle pieces.\n\nAnyways, the last on was ‘Moskva, snova zhizn' which translates to ‘Moscow, life again’ then again, I wouldn’t know very well, in each of the files every last word was in the native tongue then a few others, English, Arabic, Chinese and oddly Uzbek to name a few.\n\nThese papers were thick, lengthy not only because each file had multiple copies in the different tongues but because originally, they were long to begin with.\n\nAfter a few years at least of testing, getting the power needed and building it was time for another test. This machine was not designed to tell if one was dead by definition, i could tell when someone was dead by classical definition but i wanted to find out when someone’s soul left their body.\n\nTo make sure it didn’t just malfunction I needed to make something just as complicated, a computer that if someone wanted to, they could transmit words to the computer through their mind. It was like connecting to their soul to talk through a computer.\n\nThe discoveries I’ve made just to build it, I have used ingredients nobody could imagine using for science, unethical things and hidden things.\n\nBut it worked, I connected the metal strap to my arm thinking, on the computer the words of my mind appeared on the otherwise black screen with a bold automated voice announcing it through the room.\n\nIt was ready, fifty years of work leading up to this. I had three people sign up for the experiment, they each connected the metal bands around their wrists while I made sure everything was right.\n\nI handed each a cup of cold water moving around in the glass, earlier I placed three dissolving pills into the glass.\n\nI won’t say why they agreed, but they agreed and knew what would happen. They drank sharing thoughts through the computers for five minutes until they slowed, they spoke openly with slurred speech moving their hands slowly until it stopped.\n\nThe computers stopped, their pulses had stopped and for five more minutes there was nothing. I drank a cup of cold water scooping out my old ravioli waiting and almost begging for anything to happen.\n\nThen it did, while o checked the bodies the sun starting to go down only lighten up by candles the robotic voice boomed.\n\n“Where am I?” I turned; the souls were still there. Now I could finally see how long the soil truly took to leave.\n\n“I can’t see, help me. The pain” the voice spoke with no amount of emotion as it was made to do.\n\n“Where are you?” I spoke close to the body, if my study of the body was correct the ears were still functional for however much longer.\n\n“My body, the pain” I grabbed my notebook writing notes down.\n\nSuddenly screams erupted from the computer, in the same voice of robot but was clearly intended to be screams.\n\n“Aaaaaahhhh!”\n\nThe screams didn’t stop, at one day it grew more silent and they couldn’t here me anymore, at one week they had been talking and yelling about the pain.\n\nAt six weeks the bodies began to decompose but the bodies spoke, they begged to die but they were already dead and they couldn’t hear me. The voices, the cursed voices! They wouldn’t stop!\n\nI may have experimented seeing what part of the body the soul resided in but they continued. Six weeks and the souls were here.\n\nI quickly disconnected the bodies hauling them in a large black bag to my basement throwing them in, I grabbed another bag dragging it out and desperately cutting it with my cold knife, I pulled the skeleton that was dead for two years pulling the arm up and connecting it.\n\nWithin minutes terrified screeches played from the machine begging the pain to stop, there was no life in the skeleton but it resided. It didn’t die when it died, it stayed alive living in the bones screaming.\n\n“I can’t move! Help me! Stop the pain! Anything! Why can’t I see?” It seemed all senses were gone except for whatever kept them alive.\n\n“Make it stop! Make it stop! Make it stop!” I had no choose to oblige stomping the body breaking the bones with horrid snaps echoing the halls, but even after those words of begging left the machine to my ears.\n\n“Just let me die!” The voice screamed; I pulled it away from the arm stopping the screaming. My deepest hope was that the machine failed, but attaching it to my arm it worked just fine. And I collapsed.\n\nI fell to the ground; I didn’t know what to do. To pray or hope my days would last longer or that somewhere I failed but deep down i knee I hadn’t.\n\nSo, I curled up and sobbed, tears drained my eyes falling to the ground where I slept, does the FBI know? Does anyone know? I hadn’t a clue, only a fear.",

        "text": "I recently got a new job as a dog sitter for this fairly rich family for a paycheck of $850 a day. I was ecstatic as most would be. Especially being a college student. So, Sunday morning I arrived at the house and approached the wooden door. The house was bigger than I anticipated it was almost intimidating. I got a sudden chill as I reached up to knock when the door opened.\n\n\"Oh hello you must me Nancy.\" A middle aged woman said with a warm smile.\n\n\"Yes. I am. I came here to dog sit your dogs Sunny, River, and Indigo.\" I explained with a warm smile back.\n\n\"Yes. Come in I just need to give you the rules.\" Mrs. Smith explained as I went in. Her three dogs came over with the clicking of their nails. Sunny was a large 2 year old XL American Bully, River was a medium sized Border collie, and Indigo was a Belgian Malinois. River and Indigo came with 2 slobbery tennis balls while Sunny just came with his wagging tail. \n\n\"Here is the list of rules. Usually, I'd stick around to explain them to you but I'm running a bit late for work.\" Mrs. Smith explained with a smile and a reassuring pat on the back. I took the piece of paper from her hands and began to read it. The rules read:\n\n\"1. You may see cuts, welts, and stranger marks on the dogs I promise you It's nothing and not to think anything of it. \n\n2. When staying the night you may hear yelping from the dogs. It is nothing I assure you.\n\n3. Take the dogs out on leash. They run away when off leash.\n\n4. Don't let the dogs on beds or furniture. We will know trust me.\n\n5. The dogs are fed by us you don't need to worry about feeding them. \n\n6. The dogs play a little rough but don't worry they don't ever seriously harm each other. \n\n7. The dogs aren't overly well behaved but don't worry they are harmless. They know enough, stay, and place if needed along with heel for walks.\n\n8. Take them on at least a 3-mile-long walk before we get home. We are too tired to do it.\"\n\nRight as I finished reading Indigo grabbed Sunny's ear as they began to wrestle. They slammed each other against walls and furniture. I had to stay the night today so I placed my stuff in the guest bedroom that was marked. I sat down and turned on the TV. I threw the ball a couple times and pet Sunny. Sunny, if I remembered correctly, wasn't overly playful and was more the cuddler. I frowned when I felt a lump on his side. I remembered the rule and continued on. The night was overly normal beside the yelping. I thought it was odd but ignored it as I was told. I didn't feed them in the morning and then left. \n\nWhen I returned the next day, I noticed the dogs seemed almost thinner, but I chalked it up to the 3-mile-walks I took them on. I got up to a knock on the door and opened it. I stepped back in shock to see 2 police officers standing there.\n\n\"Are Mr or Mrs. Smith there?\"\n\nThe police are currently talking to me and discussing what I know. Apparently, the dogs have been getting beat each night and the welts and marks were the cause of it and the last dog sitter who tried to report them was found dead. The dogs are being taken from them and they will see what they will do with them after that. Most likely a shelter as they don't want to risk family returning them.",

        "text": "“I can’t live here anymore,” I told Aaron. “Not after what it did to Amy. [What I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1110bck/we_bought_a_house_that_eats_the_dead_we_started/).”\n\nWe were laying in bed with the lights off, ready to go to sleep. It was my least favorite time in the house, the hour when it was at its hungriest. All through every hall and room, I heard the sandpaper scratch of its invisible teeth on anything dead. There would be no hairs in the drain to fish out, no flakes of dead skin to turn to dust. \n\n“It saved her,” he said. “Don’t forget that. If not for you doing what you did. If not for the house–”\n\n“Maybe,” I said. “Maybe not. We’ll never know.”\n\nI took his hands and looked him in the eye. It was a gesture we’d learned from our therapist when we did pre-marriage counseling. It was supposed to center us, to make sure the other person *really* heard.\n\n“We need to sell this house,” I told him. “I can’t be in that position again, playing god for my sister or anyone else. We need to sell it.”\n\nAaron nodded. \n\n“I’ll call the realtor in the morning.”\n\nAaron was as good as his word. We started looking around town for a new place, and in the meantime, ours went on the market. \n\nThanks to the changing interest rates, the new places we checked out were all downgrades–too small, too close to a freeway, barely any yard to speak of. But they all had one significant advantage over our current place: they weren’t fucking cursed.\n\n“Did they even clean this place?” asked Aaron, examining the baseboards in a little ranch style place down by the railroad district. \n\n“I don’t mind a little dust,” I said. “We’re just not used to it anymore.”\n\n“It’s small,” he added. “Grace and Derek would have to share a room.”\n\n“It’s good to learn to share,” I told him. “It’s perfect.”\n\nOf course, to buy the new house, we needed to sell the old one. And that’s where things got complicated. \n\nWhenever we discussed the sale inside, I noticed a kind of wrongness that followed, as if the house had overheard us and grown angry. Its eating became more aggressive. Food that had once taken hours to disappear was now gone in minutes. One day, sitting in a practically brand new wooden chair, it practically imploded around me. By the time I landed on the floor, the legs had turned to sawdust.\n\n“We can’t talk about the sale inside anymore,” I said one day as Aaron finished talking through final details for an open house with the realtor. “The house isn’t happy. It doesn’t want us to go.”\n\n“You’re projecting,” said Aaron. “The house doesn’t have… you know, a mind? It’s just a tool like we’ve always said. It’s up to us to use it smartly.”\n\n“When the fuck did you become the world’s expert on haunted houses,” I suddenly blurted out. I had never really talked to Aaron like that. We were always mindful of each other, always a team. “I’m sorry,” I said after a few seconds. “I just–”\n\n“You’re stressed,” he said. “I get it. \n\n“Just, can we make sure we don’t talk about the S-A-L-E inside anymore?” I asked.\n\nAaron chuckled and shot me a teasing smile. “You don’t think our haunted house can spell?”\n\nAnd then came the open house from hell. Our realtor, Janet, told us to stay away, but I couldn’t resist. I promised to pretend I was a prospective buyer. She didn’t like it, but after all, she worked for us. \n\nPeople started trickling in around noon. Dozens of them. Janet’s eyes went wide as she mouthed, “I should have baked more cookies!”\n\nThe more I looked at the buyers, though, the more nervous I got. Most of them were single men, all shifty-eyed and nervous. Why were they looking at a single family home? \n\nApparently, the house attracted a certain kind of buyer. It couldn't have been the way we worded the listing–that was all boilerplate. Maybe it was the pictures we posted online. If you ask me, though, it was the house itself, calling to the type of masters it desired.\n\nThe first man I noticed couldn’t stop fidgeting. He had one tic going on in his face, another with his hands. I followed him discreetly around the kitchen, watching him slyly pocket my knives and forks. I didn’t say a word, wondering what he’d do next. \n\nBut ultimately he was small-time. After a few minutes, he excused himself and walked excitedly to his car, his pants jangling with silverware.\n\nHe turned out to be the best of the bunch.\n\nAnother man was so large he could barely walk. He ate the entire tray of cookies Janet had baked for the occasion. He left chugging a bottle of cheap wine from our pantry. I had no idea how he even got it open.\n\nAnd then there was the man in the white suit. He made a beeline for Grace’s room and stood there, barely moving for maybe fifteen minutes. He breathed deeply, as if trying to inhale her lingering scent. Above him, an elephant mobile danced gently in the breeze from the air conditioner. Finally, he left, talking briefly with Janet on the way out.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, Janet sprinted up to me, practically jumping with joy.\n\n“He *loves* it,” she said. “Willing to go full asking!”\n\n“He only looked at the one room,” I said, trying to understand what the hell had just happened.\n\n“Well, I guess he really liked that room,” she said.\n\nShe seemed just about ready to pop a bottle of champagne when another man approached. He was wearing filthy overalls, like he’s just put in a long day as a mechanic and hadn’t bothered to change or even shower.\n\n“I couldn’t help but overhear,” he mumbled. “Whatever he’s offering, I’ll beat it. All cash.”\n\nJanet raised her eyebrows.\n\n“So then it’s… a bidding war,” she said. I could almost see her eyes turning into dollar signs. “What agent are you working with?”\n\n“Representing myself,” muttered the man. “You tell me the price.”\n\nHe wiped his brow and then watched as the sweat disappeared off of his hand completely, the house consuming it. He smiled like a child and wiped his brow again. \n\n“It’s a lovely home,” he told me quietly, though I didn’t recall telling him I was the owner. “Very clean.”\n\nThat night, I couldn’t sleep. After a while, I shook Aaron awake.\n\n“We can’t sell to either of those men,” I said. “It’s… it’s not right. If either of them had the house…” A shudder went through me. “They… they can never have this house.”\n\n“So… what then? Do we pull it off the market? Take a lower offer?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. “I just know it can’t be them. It’s like you’ve always said, this house is a tool. And if the wrong person got control of it–”\n\nI might have said more, but at that moment, we heard the sound of breaking glass downstairs, followed by the creak of a door opening. Footsteps quickly followed. Whoever it was didn’t spend more than a few moments in the entryway before heading to the staircase.\n\nI fumbled for my phone to call the police, for all the good it would do. If someone was there to do us harm, we’d be dead long before they arrived.\n\n“The kids,” I said jumping out of bed, but Aaron was already way ahead of me. He was at his closet door, quickly bringing down a box from a high shelf. He opened it with precise movements and then withdrew a small gun. Before I even knew what was happening, he’d loaded it and headed for the door.\n\n“Aaron,” I whispered. “Since when do you have a–”\n\nHe held his finger to his mouth, then listened at the door as the footsteps proceeded up the stairs. We heard two, three, four steps, and then the door to Grace’s room slowly opening.\n\nAaron didn’t waste another second. He burst out of our bedroom door. \n\nThe next thing I heard was two gunshots and Grace’s scream. \n\n“Aaron?” I called, but there was no response. I looked around the room for any kind of weapon and found nothing. But there was no time. I had to get our there.\n\nI ran out of the room to find Aaron standing over the body of the man in the white suit. \n\n“Daddy!” Grace shouted. “Daddy!”\n\n“Shhh,” said Aaron, walking into her room. “It’s okay, honey. It’s just a nightmare, that’s all.”\n\nLater, after Grace was sound asleep, we dragged the man to the basement. We didn’t bother to clean the trail of blood he left behind. The house would do that for us. It took everything I had to keep it together. I’d seen bodies before, but never like this, never a corpse leaking blood on my hardwood floors. \n\nAnd I found I could barely look at Aaron. My heart ached with gratitude that he’d spared Grace the worst of all fates, but at the same time, I couldn’t quite comprehend the speed with which he’d shot the man. He hadn’t hesitated even a second, unloading two shots before the man’s body hit the floor.\n\nFinally, we got the man’s body to the hot spot where we’d once put Carter’s ashes.\n\n“Now what?” I asked.\n\n“Now the house does the rest,” said Aaron.\n\n“But we’ll remember.”\n\n“But no one else will. And if no one else ever reminds us, we’ll eventually forget.”\n\n“How the hell am I supposed to forget this?” I asked, almost crying. “Aaron. You–you killed somebody. Doesn’t that make you feel–”\n\n“Fine,” he said. “I feel fine. Good even. Who knows how many little girls that creep got to before he–” He trailed off. “Look, maybe we could use a drink.”\n\nAnd so we shared a bottle of Zinfandel as we watched the man wither and decay.\n\n“So much for the bidding war,” said Aaron, trying to lighten the mood.\n\n“You know what he would have done with this place,” I said with a shudder. \n\nAaron nodded. “I know.”\n\nAfter maybe an hour, the man was gone, white suit and all, leaving nothing behind but the contents of his pockets: a small gun of his own and a set of keys.\n\nAaron picked up the weapon and examined it under the basement’s fluorescent light.\n\n“Figure he must have come in planning to use this on us, then take Grace with him,” he said. “Or maybe worse.” He sniffed at the weapon, his eyebrows twitching. “Recently fired.”\n\nHe picked up the keys. “We should check his vehicle.”\n\nWe walked out into the night together. Key in hand, Aaron pushed the button repeatedly until we saw a new Subaru sedan’s lights turn on. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and peered inside. Everything was impeccably clean, almost like our house. No wonder he’d wanted to buy it.\n\n“Check the trunk,” said Aaron, and I realized he was still holding his gun, his eyes darting back and forth around our dark suburban neighborhood, looking for threats.\n\nAs the trunk opened, I almost gagged. Inside, was the man with the overalls. He must have been dead for hours, based on how stiff he was. The man in white must have shot him in the head and then torn his eyes out with some kind of crude instrument.\n\n“Figures,” said Aaron. \n\n“What do we do?” I asked, fighting the rising panic.\n\n“We take him in.”\n\n“Can’t we just leave him?”\n\n“In a car outside our house? Murdered by a man that the cops are going to think doesn’t exist? Who is this car even supposed to belong to in this new reality? We don’t know! So here’s what we do: we have to take him into the house and let it clean up this mess.”\n\nI wasn’t sure if I quite followed the logic, but I knew I wasn’t emotionally equipped to deal with any of this. Already, I felt like I had stepped outside my body, that I was watching my own life play out like a movie:\n\nWe each grabbed one of the man’s hands and dragged him into the house. Had a neighbor seen us do it? Who cared? Once the house finished its works, those memories would be gone along with the dead man.\n\nFinally, we got him down to the basement, right in the same spot we’d used just minutes before.\n\nAaron and I sat in silence, finishing off the rest of the wine bottle, then opening another.\n\n“When did you buy a gun?” I asked after a few minutes.\n\n“I’ve always had it,” he said. “I told you, I did ROTC back in college.”\n\n“You never told me you had a gun.”\n\n“I never wanted to use it,” he said. “Good thing I had it though, right?”\n\n“Right,” I said, taking another drink. And for the first time in years, I looked at Aaron and saw a stranger. \n\n“We can’t sell this house,” he said after a few minutes. “The house takes care of us. You see that now, right?”\n\nI hugged him tight. I didn’t want to seem ungrateful for all he’d done. “If it means selling to people like them, we’ll keep it til we die.”\n\nLater, Aaron went to bed and I decided to take a bath. \n\nExcept I didn’t run the water. I didn’t need to. All of the blood from the two dead men that had once painted my arms and tshirt was already gone. I was completely clean, just as if the night had ever happened, as if they’d never existed. \n\nAnd I just lay there and lay there, waiting for Aaron to fall asleep, not wanting to hear him speak another word.\n\nLater that week, I found myself driving though Pamela’s neighborhood. I hadn’t spoken to her since our coffee the day my nephew died. I wasn’t sure what it was, but something compelled me to walk up the steps to her door and knock.\n\n“Welcome back,” she said. “More questions, I take it?”\n\n“Just one,” I said. “Why did you sell the house to us? You must have had other buyers. Probably a lot of them. Why us?”\n\nA knowing smile crossed her lips.\n\n“Naturally with a special house like that, there are some people you just *can’t* sell it to,” she said. “And there was you two. Of course, you were just along for the ride, weren’t you? I thought maybe that was a good thing. Your husband was the one who *really* wanted the place.”\n\nI thought back, and it was true. I hadn’t loved the house or hated it. I’d just thought it was priced pretty well. But Aaron had been head over heels, insisting we outbid a slew of other buyers.\n\nShe closed her eyes as if remembering something, and then nodded her head. For a moment, I couldn’t tell if she was afraid or amused. \n\nFinally, she just whispered, “It does attract a certain kind of buyer, doesn’t it?”",

        "text": "\nI am the only one who can see ghosts. It's a curse that I've had to live with for as long as I can remember. They follow me everywhere I go, tormenting me with their presence. They whisper things in my ear, telling me to end my life, to join them on the other side. I've learned to ignore them, but it's not always easy.\n\nMy name is Jack. I live in a small town on the outskirts of the city. I work at the local hardware store, and I keep to myself most of the time. I don't have any friends, and I don't date. I'm too scared to get close to anyone, too afraid that they'll see what I see and think I'm crazy.\n\nI remember the first time I saw a ghost. I was a little boy, and I was playing in the park. I saw a woman standing by the pond, but there was something off about her. She looked sad and distant, and when I got closer, she vanished into thin air. I didn't know what to make of it at the time, but over the years, I realized that I had a special gift. Or, more accurately, a curse.\n\nThe ghosts come and go, but there are a few that are always with me. They follow me around like a pack of wolves, waiting for me to slip up so they can pounce. They tell me I'm worthless, that nobody cares about me, that I should just end it all. It's hard to ignore them when they're always whispering in my ear.\n\nSometimes I try to reason with them, but it never works. They're trapped in their own world, and they don't care about anything except getting me to join them. They don't understand that I don't want to die. I have a life, a family, a job. But they don't care about any of that.\n\nIt's not just the voices that haunt me. Sometimes I see things that aren't there. Shadows that move on their own, doors that slam shut for no reason, objects that fly across the room. It's terrifying, and I don't know how to make it stop.\n\nI've tried everything to get rid of them. I've seen doctors, taken medication, even tried therapy. But nothing works. The ghosts are always there, lurking in the background, waiting for their chance to strike.\n\nOne night, as I was leaving work, I saw a ghost standing in the parking lot. It was a man, tall and thin, with a twisted smile on his face. He didn't say anything, but I could feel his presence, like a cold wind blowing through me. I tried to walk past him, but he blocked my way.\n\n\"Hello, Jack,\" he said, his voice like ice. \"We've been waiting for you.\"\n\nI tried to run, but he grabbed me by the arm and pulled me back. I could see other ghosts gathering around us, their eyes fixed on me. They looked hungry, like they wanted to devour me.\n\n\"You can't run, Jack,\" the man said. \"We're part of you now. We'll never leave you alone.\"\n\nI closed my eyes and prayed for it to end. But when I opened them again, the ghosts were still there, closer than ever.\n\nI don't know how long I stood there, trapped in that nightmare. It could have been minutes or hours. But eventually, the ghosts began to fade away, one by one. The man was the last to go, and as he vanished, he left behind a strange symbol on the ground.\n\nI didn't know what it meant, but I knew it couldn't be good.\n\nThe next day, I went to the library and started researching the symbol that the ghost had left behind. I spent hours pouring over books and online resources, trying to find any information about it. Finally, I found a reference to the symbol in an ancient text about a cult that practiced dark magic.\n\nThe cult was known for summoning and controlling spirits to do their bidding, and the symbol was their mark. I was terrified. If the ghosts were linked to this cult, then they could be much more powerful than I had ever imagined.\n\nI knew I had to find a way to protect myself. I searched for any information about the cult and found that there was a group of people who had been investigating them for years. They had an online forum where they shared information and strategies for dealing with the cult's followers.\n\nI signed up for the forum and started posting about my experiences with the ghosts. To my surprise, I received a flood of responses from people who had gone through the same thing. They offered me support and advice, and for the first time, I felt like I wasn't alone.\n\nThrough the forum, I met a woman named Samantha who lived in the city. She had a reputation for being an expert on the occult and was known for helping people who were plagued by ghosts. I was hesitant at first, but eventually, I reached out to her and asked for her help.\n\nSamantha agreed to meet with me and we set up a time to talk. When I arrived at her office, I was nervous and scared. But Samantha put me at ease and listened to my story with a kind and understanding ear.\n\nAfter hearing everything I had to say, Samantha told me that the symbol the ghost had left behind was indeed the mark of the cult. She said that they were dangerous and that I needed to be careful.\n\nSamantha gave me a charm to wear that would protect me from the ghosts. She also gave me some advice on how to handle them when they appeared. She told me to stand my ground, to be firm with them, and to never let them see that I was afraid.\n\nI started following Samantha's advice, and over time, I began to feel more confident. The ghosts still came, but they were no longer able to control me as they had before. They still whispered their taunts and threats, but I was able to tune them out and go about my life.\n\nI even started dating again and made some new friends. I still kept my gift a secret, but I no longer felt like a prisoner in my own mind. I was finally able to live my life on my own terms.\n\nOne day, I received a message on the forum from Samantha. She said that she had received information about the cult and that they were planning to summon a powerful demon. She asked for my help in stopping them.\n\nAt first, I was hesitant. I had never done anything like that before, and I wasn't sure I was ready to face that kind of danger. But then I thought about all the people who had helped me along the way, and I knew I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.\n\nTogether with Samantha and the other members of the forum, we devised a plan to stop the cult. It was a risky plan, but we knew we had to try.\n\nOn the night of the ritual, we gathered outside the abandoned warehouse where the cult was meeting. We waited in the darkness, watching as the cult members arrived one by one.\n\nWhen the time was right, we rushed in, our charms and spells at the ready. The cult members fought back, but we were able to overpower them. We destroyed the summoning circle and burned the altar where the demon was supposed to appear.\n\nIn the end, we were able to stop the cult and prevent the demon from being summoned. We turned the cult members over to the authorities, and they were arrested for their crimes.\n\nWith the cult disbanded, the ghosts that had tormented me for so long began to fade away. They no longer haunted me, and I was finally free from their influence.\n\nI continued to work with Samantha and the other members of the forum to help others who were struggling with the paranormal. Together, we formed a network of support for people who had gifts like mine.\n\nOver time, I found that I had gained a newfound sense of purpose. I was able to use my gift to help others, and it was a source of great satisfaction for me.\n\nI met someone special, and we fell in love. We got married and started a family, and I knew that I had finally found the happiness that I had been searching for.\n\nLooking back, I realized that my gift had been both a curse and a blessing. It had brought me to the brink of despair, but it had also led me to find a community of people who understood me and accepted me for who I was.\n\nI knew that I would never be completely free of the paranormal, but I was no longer afraid. I had found a way to live with it, and even embrace it, and that was a source of great comfort to me.\n\nAs I looked out the window, watching the sun rise over the city, I felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over me. I knew that I had finally found my place in the world, and I was grateful for every moment of it.",

        "text": "It’s been ten months since I first remember meeting Brandon, but, according to the rest of the world, he and I became a couple three years ago.\n\nIt all started after the surgery. When I awoke from my anesthesia-induced sleep, I nodded groggily as the doctor listed common post-operative symptoms – like drowsiness, dizziness, and disorientation. Then, two nurses wheeled me down an elevator, through the main lobby, and outside the hospital.\n\nEven though I’d arranged for my friend Mae to pick me up, the car that arrived was not her black sedan but, instead, an unfamiliar silver SUV. The stranger who emerged from it was a tall, well-built man with hazy green eyes and tousled red hair.\n\nPanic rushed through me as he squeezed my hand and told me in a firm, deep voice that he was so glad that the operation had been a success, and that he’d be taking good care of me while I recovered.\n\nI tried to scream. I tried to explain to the nurses that they were delivering me into the arms of an abductor. But, in my weakened state, all I could manage were weak whimpers and incoherent mumbles that the man and nurses dismissed as “side effects” and “temporary confusion” as they lifted me into the car.\n\nThe ignition started. As the hospital faded into the distance, I tried to beg the man to free me. With immense effort, I managed to croak words like “please,” “don’t,” and “stop,” but to no avail. If the man heard me, he gave no sign of it.\n\nMeanwhile, a sense of absolute exhaustion gradually descended over me. The last thing I remember before darkness overcame me was the man’s loving smile, and three words that haunted the frightening dreams that followed: *I love you.*\n\nWhen I awoke the next morning, I found myself, to my immense relief, in the familiar location of the bedroom of my townhouse. For a moment, I wrote off what had happened as a dream, or a hallucination brought on by my semi-conscious state. Maybe Mae had picked me up after all.\n\nSoon enough, however, the same man stepped into my room. He placed a tray with two slices of toast and a small fruit smoothie on a bedside table and, upon seeing that I was awake, asked me how I was feeling.\n\nThe scream I uttered left him flustered and pale-faced. “April, what’s wrong?” he asked.\n\n*He knew my name.* “**Get out, get out, now!**” I hollered.\n\n“Okay…” he said quietly as he backed out of my room.\n\nI mustered what energy I had to leap out of bed and lock the door. I found my phone in its usual place atop a dresser.\n\nThe photo that displayed on the background of the phone screen caused me to drop it. A nauseous feeling ran through me as I picked it up and stared, wide-eyed, at the image of the stranger and me, smiling and holding hands. The sight of an ornate diamond ring on my finger in the picture – one that matched the gold band that he wore – made me dizzy.\n\nWith trembling hands, I dialed 911.\n\nWhen the police arrived, the man – who identified himself as Brandon Harrison – spoke calmly as the officers interrogated him.\n\nEverything he said checked out. He produced a marriage license, and his driver’s license listed my home address. He showed the officers the numerous photos of us together that were displayed around the house. “I’m just worried about April. She’s never been like this before.”\n\n“Don’t listen to him,” I begged. “He’s *lying*.”\n\n“How about you and I go upstairs,” said one of the officers, who proceeded to lead me to my bedroom while her partner stayed with Brandon.\n\nWhen I started to ramble again, she cut me off. “Look, ma’am, please try to see this from my perspective. You’re still recovering from a medical procedure, and this man has everything – and I mean everything – to prove that he is, in fact, your husband, and that he lives here with you.”\n\n“You *can’t* be serious. You’re not going to leave me alone with this man-”\n\n“Has he hurt you? Threatened you in any way?”\n\n“Well, no, but…” My voice drifted off. “But, officer, I have friends, and family…they’ll confirm what I’m telling you.”\n\nThe officers left after my friends and family did the opposite. Every person I contacted swore to the same version of events: that I married Brandon almost a year ago, and that we’d been living together as a couple for even longer.\n\nMy own social media pages were consistent with the happy pictures of us displayed around the house. Post after post reflected us living and traveling together. My phone and text message histories, meanwhile, were filled with corresponding communications.\n\nAll of it left me absolutely baffled and confounded. I had no idea what to do. I just knew that I did not feel safe having Brandon in the house with me.\n\n“It’s my house too, you know,” he replied when I asked him to leave. “But, fine, I’ll go to a friend’s place, or a hotel, or somewhere else until you figure out whatever is happening to you, if you promise to see a doctor in the meantime. I’m so worried about you.”\n\n“Fine. Just go, please.”\n\nOver the next few days, I met with practitioner after practitioner. Many had records or notes reflecting my marriage to Brandon, such as me mentioning him in response to routine questions, and none could clearly explain what was happening. They all agreed that I exhibited no signs of mental or physical illness that could explain why three years of memories of my husband had somehow vanished from my mind.\n\n“Regardless of what’s causing this,” said the surgeon who’d performed the operation, “whether it’s a truly novel side effect of the surgery, or a psychological breakdown of some kind – what’s unequivocal is that you are, in fact, married to Mr. Harrison, and that you’ve known him for several years.” \n\nI was sitting on my living room couch, tall glass of red wine in hand, when Brandon called. I hit ‘decline,’ took a big gulp of my drink, and leaned my head back against the wall.\n\n*What the fuck do I do now?* I thought. The whole world was telling me something that I knew wasn’t true. During a long call with my parents, my mother had insisted that I invite Brandon back, and my father had even implied that I was deliberately lying about losing my memories of him.\n\nLogically, the only answer is that, somehow, everyone else was correct – this man really was my husband, and I was losing my mind, or in denial, or *something*. As much as I *felt* otherwise, no other explanation was possible.\n\nAnd Brandon wasn’t acting maliciously. Instead, he was complying with everything I asked of him, to the point that he was living out of a hotel despite having the legal right to reside with me here, in a house *he* apparently co-owned. If it were all some elaborate lie, then what was he gaining from it?\n\nI downed another glass of wine and called him back. He answered right away.\n\nWe talked for hours. He asked about my health and the results of my recent appointments.\n\nI asked him about how we met. He related how he’d used his old red pickup truck to pull my car out of a ditch during a blizzard. By coincidence, we’d run into each other at a bar a few weeks later, where I’d insisted on buying him a drink as a token of appreciation. We’d hit it off quickly and made plans together to meet again. Before long, we considered ourselves a couple.\n\nHe described leaving his apartment to move in with me, proposing to me in a park by the harbor, and planning our small wedding. He told me I’d never been as beautiful as I was when he saw me approach the altar.\n\n“I don’t know what’s happening, April,” he told me, “but I love you with all my heart, and I know we can work through this. We were happy together, and we can be happy together again.”\n\nI realized I was crying. He sounded so sincere, and I could sense real emotion behind his words. “I believe you,” I said. “But try to imagine what it’s like for me. To just be told, by everyone, that so much of my life happened differently from what I remember.”\n\n“Take your time,” he responded. “As long as you need. When you’re ready to see me again let me know.”\n\nI tossed and turned all night. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was living a life that wasn’t mine, like I’d slipped from one reality to another – one where I didn’t belong.\n\nBecause no matter how patient and understanding Brandon acted…I couldn’t change the fact that I didn’t feel anything for him. I barely *knew* him, much less loved him. I thought about the pain he must be feeling, for his whole life to just be inexplicably upended one day, and I couldn’t help but feel like I was somehow responsible.\n\nI decided to call my mother again. “Honey,” she told me. “I would never lie to you, ever, and you know that. So listen to me when I say this: Brandon is your husband, and you need to let him back into your life.”\n\nAn hour later, I called Brandon and told him that I was alright with him moving back in, so long as he stayed in the guest room in the basement.\n\nMonths passed with us living together like roommates. At first, we handled our own meals, but after a while, we started cooking for each other. Sometimes we’d sit at opposite ends of the couch and watch tv.\n\nI asked him questions about our time together, and he supplied me with plenty of stories – the early date during which I’d putted a golf ball so badly that it went spiraling over a fence and onto a nearby highway, the time he’d carried me for nearly half a mile after I injured myself during a jog, and our honeymoon on an Alaskan cruise. We had a natural chemistry, and he often made me laugh. At the end of the night, he’d retire to the pull-out couch downstairs.\n\nWe took many walks together at a nearby public park. These outings were generally uneventful, except for one occasion when Brandon intervened to stop a crazed woman from harassing me. \n\nI’d been giving her dog, a sweet ridgeback who’d run up to me, some scratches and pets, when she started  to scream at me. As I backed away from the dog, she made a hostile, guttural sound, and I noticed what looked like narrow streams of blood running down from her eyes as she wailed. She charged at me, but Brandon intervened, shoving her off me and telling her to leave me alone. Another bystander restrained her as we hurried away, and I thanked Brandon for looking out for me. \n\nOtherwise, life fell into a mundane routine. We were watching a tense movie once when I realized I’d been gripping Brandon’s hand. Afterwards, he told me his back was aching from all the nights he’d spent on the foldout downstairs.\n\nI took a deep breath. “I’m being a jerk, keeping the bed all to myself. We should set up a rotation in terms of who stays there, and who is in the basement.”\n\n“That’s not what I meant,” he replied. “I mean, yeah, the bed’s more comfortable, but I miss going to sleep with *you*.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Brandon, I-.”\n\nHe continued. “I have nightmares sometimes. In them, you’re living your life without me. I try to talk to you, but it’s like I’m a ghost, and you can’t hear me or see me. When I wake up, I’m covered in sweat. You used to be there to comfort me, but now I’m all alone down in the dark basement. I miss you.”\n\n“Brandon, I’m just not there yet.”\n\nHe sighed. “Okay.”\n\nI finally asked him a question I’d been holding back for weeks. “Do you think I’m lying? About not remembering you?”\n\n“No,” he responded, abruptly. “Not at all. I don’t know what it is – if it was some fluke side effect of the surgery, or some kind of undiagnosed condition – but I know that you would never lie about something like this. I wouldn’t have married you if I didn’t trust you completely.”\n\nAs much as I appreciated his words, the exchange left me feeling terrible. We were a married couple, after all,. I had to assume that we’d done plenty of things together. But, now, I didn’t even want to fall asleep in the same room as him.\n\nThe truth was that I continued to feel no meaningful attraction towards Brandon. I’d developed an affection for him, sure. He seemed polite, self-sacrificing, and protective of me. Perhaps he was good-looking, too, in an objective sense. But he sparked no romantic interest in me. It made me feel awful, given how kind and patient he was being to me.\n\nMaybe that would change with time – maybe, eventually, I’d feel towards him the way I must have in the photos displayed around the house of us kissing or embracing. But what if that never happened? I couldn’t stay married to someone I didn’t love, no matter how good he was to me.\n\nStill, I figured the least I could do was return some of the kindness he’d shown me by switching out our rooms as I’d offered. I wanted it to be a surprise for him.\n\nAfter he left for work the next morning, I set about moving the belongings he’d brought to the basement back up to the bedroom. I decided to wash the sheets and pillowcase he’d been using as well.\n\nWhen I lifted his pillow, I noticed a slight bulge in fabric where the mattress met the back of the couch. Reaching my hand under the fabric and up the backrest, I felt something solid. I gripped it and slowly pulled it out.\n\nIt was an old, tattered book. A pattern was infused into its otherwise blank mahogany leather cover. A golden triangle stood in its center. Three charcoal ovals lay over it, each intersecting with one of the triangle’s sides. At the top, just above the triangle’s pyramid tip, was a half-circle. Tiny, unrecognizable characters lined its thin, sepia perimeter.\n\nIts aged, browned pages were of uneven sizes. Curious about their contents, I tried opening the book, only to discover that it was locked by a narrow, metal clasp with a tiny key hole.\n\nI didn’t know what to make of it. I couldn’t find the key for it, and when I looked online, I couldn’t identify anything that matched the pattern on the cover. \n\nIt could just be something as innocuous as a vintage private diary, or a family heirloom. But the way Brandon had tucked it out of sight disturbed me. Clearly, he didn’t want me to find it, and this was the first time, to my knowledge, that he’d tried to hide something from me.\n\nFor the moment, I elected to leave the book where I’d found it and not mention it to Brandon while I gathered more information. I had a friend who might be able to help me, after all. I took a picture of the cover, texted it to Mae, and carefully put the book back in its place.\n\nI pulled up to the house that Mae, her boyfriend Casey, and her roommate Olivia rented half of soon after. She led me away from the closed door to Olivia’s room, through the kitchen, and down the short hallway to where she and Casey, who was at work, stayed.\n\nAs we sat together on her bed, I noticed that Mae’s once-small collection of cacti had expanded into an indoor garden that filled at least a third of the room.\n\n“I still name them after people, you know,” she said with a smirk. She pointed to a potted cactus by her desk. “Guess what I call that one?”\n\n“I dunno. ‘April’?”\n\n“No, silly,” she said with a laugh. “It wouldn’t feel right naming one after you. This one’s Brandon.”\n\n“*What*?” Compared to the cacti and succulents around it, Brandon was smaller in size. Yet, on a closer look, I discerned that the clusters of spines that covered it appeared particularly long and jagged. “You’re ridiculous, Mae.”\n\nShe giggled. “That’s what people keep telling me. But, anyway, I assume you’re here about that picture you sent me?”\n\nI started to explain how I’d found it hidden away in the couch Brandon had been sleeping on when Mae interrupted me. “Wait, so you *still* don’t remember him?”\n\nI nodded. I hated the concerned expression on Mae’s face. It was the same look of pity I’d seen on so many people.\n\n“And, let me guess, your current theory is that this book has something to do with you forgetting all about Brandon?”\n\n“I *know* how it sounds, Mae. I just don’t know what else to think. You used to be obsessed with the occult, and I thought maybe you’d recognize the symbols on the front.” I felt my face grow red with embarrassment as I realized how unhinged I must have been sounding.\n\nMae put her arm around me. “April, I’m glad you came to me. Don’t ever be afraid to talk to me, okay? Olivia and I have both [seen some strange things](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lg323q/the_zippers_on_peoples_skin_are_becoming_undone/) ourselves, things that most people think are impossible. So believe me, I’m not dismissing your theory offhand. But I don’t recognize the image you sent me, and I turned up nothing when I researched it this morning. My best guess is that it’s just a fancy diary of some kind. Nothing more.”\n\nWe talked for a while about other subjects – the local band Casey played drums in, Olivia’s ongoing lawsuit against her former employer, and their landlord’s efforts to find them all in breach of the contract that kept their rent at the same level since 2017 - and I felt better the longer we chatted.\n\nI was about to leave when Mae stopped me. “Wait,” she croaked in a strangely pained, hollow voice.\n\n“Yes?”\n\nMae got to her feet and moved slowly toward her desk. Her steps were shaky and erratic, like her body was navigating contradictory commands. She removed a small business card from a drawer and tossed it in my direction. It flew past me and landed on the ground. As I turned to pick it up, I heard a tumbling sound, followed by a sharp cry of pain.\n\nWhen I looked back, Mae’s hand was covered in blood. To my shock, I realized it was stuck in a tight grip around cactus Brandon, with dozens of its needles protruding all the way through her palm and out the other side of her hand.\n\n“What the hell!” I shrieked. “Mae, let me help-”\n\nHer face had grown pale, and her expression was understandably agonized. “911. Call. Now. *Fuck* this hurts!”\n\nOlivia and I followed the instructions the 911 operator gave us as we waited for assistance. When paramedics arrived, Mae repeated to them what she told us: that she’d slipped and fallen, and, when she tried to catch herself, her hand had landed on the cactus.\n\nAs they carted her away for treatment, I examined the card Mae had thrown at me. It displayed a name and an address: *Monsieur Herrmann’s Occult Artifacts*, 6681 Cheshire Lane.\n\nI didn’t know what to make of it. I didn’t know what to make of a lot of things. But once Olivia assured me I didn’t need to wait at the hospital with her, I decided to follow this lead to its end.\n\nRainfall pounded at my umbrella as I hurried from my car to the door of 6681 Cheshire Lane. The store inside was lit primarily by scented candles that smelled vaguely of black cherry. Its shelves were lined with books with titles like *Encyclopedia of Demonology* or *Dark Magic and Incantations* separated by prop skulls and Baphomet statues.\n\nI came across a bald man placing a book titled *Crafting with Human Skin* on a top shelf. “Excuse me,” I asked. “Do you work here?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am,” he responded earnestly. “How can I help you?”\n\n“I, um, there’s a symbol – a pattern – that I saw. I have a picture of it. I’m wondering if you might know what it means.”\n\n“Certainly. I’m more than happy to take a look.”\n\nI opened the picture I’d taken and handed him my phone.\n\n“Oh,” he said, as he examined it. He looked at me, then back at the image.\n\n“Well?” I asked.\n\nTo my surprise, he chuckled. “It’s meaningless. There’s a craftsman out of San Antonio who makes blank notebooks with this cover and sells them online. It’s vaguely meant to recall some pagan symbols but it doesn’t have any particular meaning. Anything else I can do for you?”\n\n“No,” I said, a mix of puzzlement and relief running through me, “I think not.”\n\n\\~\n\nI didn’t mention the day’s events to Brandon. After we switched beds that night, I noticed that the book had disappeared from the couch downstairs. I decided it was likely just a diary Brandon wished to keep private and decided not to press him on it.\n\nMae left the hospital before long, albeit with an array of bandages around her hand. When I mentioned *Monsieur Herrmann’s Occult Artifacts*, she indicated that she’d been there plenty of times before but insisted that she didn’t remember giving me a card.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the episode slipped from my mind. Brandon continued to be kind and supportive, even giving me rides to and from work when my car needed minor repairs. I began to feel even closer and more comfortable around him.\n\nOne Friday night, he prepared a fancy candlelight dinner. “It’s the anniversary of when we first met,” he explained. I tried to picture the story he told me – me, stranded by the side of the road, and him driving up in his red truck to save the day. It was a good story, and I was ready to accept it was true.\n\nWe sat together after the meal. “So, April,” he said, “I was wondering how you felt about coming upstairs and staying with me. It doesn’t have to be anything more than that. Just us sleeping in the same bed again.”\n\nI gripped his hand. “Yes, I’m okay with that. Brandon, I’m so sorry for what I’m putting you through. I just wish I knew why-”\n\n“It’s okay, April. Really.”\n\n“Brandon, were we…did we have plans? Like, life plans moving forward?”\n\n“Yeah,” he responded. “We were trying to have a kid. We had it all planned out, names and everything: Hannah for a girl, Martin for a boy. But, don’t worry about that. We can take things one step at a time.”\n\nI felt secure enough around him that I fell asleep quickly that night. I awoke several hours later to the sounds of Brandon having a nightmare. He was sweating, shaking, and making low, panicked murmurs.\n\nI put my arms around him and whispered, “Brandon, it’s okay, you’re just having a bad dream.”\n\nHe calmed down quickly. For a moment, he seemed to wake up, ever so slightly. “Thank you. I love you, April.”\n\n“I love you too,” I whispered back.\n\nHe quickly went back to sleep as I realized what I’d said. I’d finally spoken those words, and I’d done so spontaneously. *Maybe things really are going to work out*, I thought as I dozed off again.\n\nThe next morning, I waited for the dealership’s shuttle to arrive to take me to pick up my car. As I climbed inside the van, I saw that it had a different driver than before. I slowly realized, to my surprise, that it was the same bald man who’d assisted me at the *Occult* store.\n\nAs he drove, he spoke to me in a frantic voice. “April, I need you to listen to me very carefully. We don’t have much time.”\n\n“What are you doing here? How do you know my name?” I pulled out my phone.\n\n“No, no, put that away!” he said. I realized he was driving at a dangerously fast speed in the opposite direction of the dealership. “You want answers, don’t you? Well, I have them.”\n\n“Look, if you want to talk, lets pull over, and-”\n\n“We don’t have time!” He yelled. “Hear me out. Please. Please. There’s a reason Mae sent you to me.”\n\nThat got my attention. “Start talking.”\n\n“You have no idea how hard I’ve worked to pull this off. We only have a brief window before he catches on. If we’re lucky, it’ll be just enough time to get to Emma, and then the two of you need to get as far away from here as possible.” \n\n“Emma? Who the hell is Emma?”\n\n“One second,” he said, as he merged the van onto the interstate. He then reached into the glove box and removed a polaroid photo, which he passed to me.\n\nIn the picture, I was in an orange sundress in a park by the harbor with a beaming expression of joy on my face. A woman I vaguely recognized was kneeling before me. In one hand, she held a leash that connected to a ridgeback puppy. In her other, she held out a beautiful golden ring.\n\n“That’s Emma, your wife,” the man said. “She and the pup - Tessa - are waiting for us at a deserted motel, a place where you may be safe for a little while.”\n\n“My *what*?” No, no, it couldn’t be…\n\n“I believe you ran into her a little while ago.”\n\nI realized where I’d seen her. She was the crazy lady at the park, the one Brandon had protected me from. “But…why, if that’s true…”\n\n“I’ve studied legends about an ancient cambion called Grousel. Until I saw you at the store, I thought they were just that – legends. I didn’t think he was real. But the symbol you showed me, and the text – it’s a book only he would have. Nobody knows for sure what’s inside of it, but the most common theory is that it’s where he records each alteration he makes.”\n\nHe continued as I tried to digest what he was saying. “Grousel casts illusions that are almost impossible to see through. And he can command people to do what he wants. It takes incredible willpower to even notice his influence, and even more to do anything about it. Even temporary resistance can only be achieved at the cost of severe physical punishment.”\n\nI remembered the blood running down the woman’s – Emma’s – face as she scrambled after me. Had she been trying to tell me who she – and who I – really was? I thought, too, about Mae’s bloody ‘accident,’ just as she directed me to the one person who had the answers I was seeking.\n\n“When you showed me the book cover,” he said, “I had to pretend I didn’t know anything about it. I arranged to pick you up, here, in circumstances that he wouldn’t view as suspicious. As far as he knows, you’re still on the way to the dealership. But as soon as he realizes you aren’t where you should be, he will search for us, and if we’re not far enough away from him, he’ll find us.”\n\n“Okay, so, mister, um-”\n\n“Call me Jean.”\n\n“Fine, Jean. So, you’re telling me that this *thing*, whatever you called it, is making all of this happen? But *why*? And if he can fool everyone else, why can’t he just make me remember being married to him?”\n\n“That’s how he harnesses his power,” said Jean, as he took an unfamiliar exit. “He latches onto a particular target, and there are limits on how much trickery he can use on that person. Sure, he can change pictures or legal documents, but he can’t go in and actually alter your memory. The more you choose, out of your own free will, to believe his lies, the stronger he becomes, and the more elaborate his illusions can become.”\n\n“But why *me*, in particular?” I asked as the car turned down a dirt road that led through a thick forest.\n\n“I can’t say for sure,” he replied. “But I suspect it’s because you’re a challenging target, for a lot of reasons. He could prey on the mentally unwell, or those easily susceptible to influence, but fooling them doesn’t give him the kind of power he craves. He chose you because he knew how skeptical you’d be. If he behaves as the texts describe, he’ll discard you in a few years, once he’s sucked all the life out of you, and then he’ll move on and find a new victim. April, I need to ask: how successful has he been so far?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Well, prior to this ride, how convinced were you that he was telling the truth? That you were, in fact, married to him?”\n\n“I dunno. I…we haven’t done anything, really...But I was starting to believe it. Last night, I even told him…”\n\nJean turned to me, a worried expression on his face. “You told him *what*?”\n\n“Watch out!” I cried, pointing to the road. But it was too late.\n\nThe red pickup truck that I’d just spotted speeding out from the woods sideswiped the van. Jean cried out as the world flipped upside down. I remember the smell of smoke and excruciating pain as I lost consciousness.\n\n\\~\n\nWhen I next opened my eyes, I found myself in a hospital bed. My vision was blurry, and I felt sore everywhere.\n\nA doctor leaned over me. He told me that I’d undergone emergency surgery to address injuries I’d sustained in a serious car accident, and that I’d been unconscious for nearly three days. He said it would take months of healing and therapy before I could walk again but that, with any luck, I’d eventually be able to make a full recovery.\n\n“You’re fortunate to have such a loving family,” he told me. “They’ve hardly left the hospital over the last few days. Do you mind if I let them come in to see you now that you’re awake?”\n\nI’m not sure why the doctor asked, as I lacked the strength and muscle control to respond either way. The doctor got up, opened the door, and called into the hallway. “She can see you now.”\n\nBrandon approached. He displayed a wide, toothy grin. “April, you have no idea how worried Martin and I were about you. It’s going to be okay, honey, I promise. I’ll take good care of you, for as long as it takes for you to get better.”\n\nA small, auburn-haired child emerged from behind Brandon. Anguished tears flooded my eyes as he placed his hand gently on my face and spoke four words: “*I love you,* [mommy](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/)*.*”",

        "text": " I need to write this down, for someone to see this, so I don’t think I’m just going insane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in Colorado, just outside Denver. One day while I was walking through the local park near my house, I saw a little path off the cement one. Let me give you the layout of the park. There are two identical parking lots on opposite sides of the park, with the playground in between. There is a man-made river going through the park, surrounded by trees on all sides. These kinds of paths aren’t uncommon, reading to the river through the trees. \n\nI had walked down this path dozens of times, but I had never seen this path before. So, because I didn’t have anything else to do that day, I walked down it. It went in a straight line and should have only taken a few moments to get to the river. \n\nNot this path. \n\nI kept walking for several minutes. I could hear the river, but it always sounded only maybe 100 feet in front of me. But no matter how far I walked, I didn't find the river and the sound stayed the same. Call it stupidity or call it curiosity, but I kept walking. I pulled out my phone and began recording a video. I narrated how the river wasn't getting closer and how by this point I shouldn't even be in the park anymore and should have left the park all together. The trees were packed so close that I could barely put my fingers between the skinny trunks. After what felt like hours, I came across the end of the path. \n\nExcept there was no river. In fact, the sound of it had quieted dramatically to what sounded like a faucet. Looking around, and showing the camera around, I realized I was in a clearing. In the middle of the clearing was a tree stump. It looked like it had been ripped and twisted off rather than cut down. On the mangled stump was a single USB flash drive. It was plain black, with sharp corners and no markings other than a small USB symbol engraved on the metal part. I held it up to the camera, then pocketed it. I retreated along the path.  \n\nAfter several hours, I saw the entrance. When I got within a foot of it, I noticed something odd. \n\nThe biker who had been going towards me along the path was frozen still. I was confused. He seemed to be balancing on the bike. His chest didn't move and his eyes were closed, as if blinking. I saw a leaf sitting in the air, not moving. The clouds were still and the sun hadn't moved at all since I entered the forest. No sound came from outside. The only sound I could hear was the river, which had resumed as soon as I left the clearing. As I stepped out of the forest, everything resumed.  \n\nThe biker shot past me and the leaf fell. The clouds began to move again and I felt and heard the wind. I turned back to the forest. It was going at hyper-speed. New plants were growing before my eyes and old ones were dying. A penny fell out of my pocket, bounced off my shoe, and went just beyond the “border”, identified by the decaying leaves. It immediately oxidized and turned dark green. Then trees and bushes erupted out of the dirt and blocked the path. Within seconds, there was no more path. It stopped moving fast and became as still as the rest of the forest. \n\nI looked down at my phone and saw that the recording was only at 00:11. I knew I had been recording for more than eleven seconds, but there weren't any other recordings. I eventually returned home as there wasn’t anything else to do. \n\nWhen I got home, I dug out my old laptop. I wasn't risking a virus from the flash drive on my good computer, but I still wanted to know what was on them. I plugged it in and immediately the files app opened. There was a new folder called “Wikipedia” so I opened it. Inside were several dozen HTML files. They all had various names, such as “SkyWings - Wikipedia.HTML” and “Wands - Wikipedia.HTML”. I clicked on one called “Dragonflame Cacti - Wikipedia.HTML”. I thought the files were a joke. The titles were all about things from fictional books and movies. Dragonflame cacti were from a book series called Wings of Fire, about dragons. Dragonflame cacti were essentially a cactus covered in thorns that explode when touched by fire. It will shoot spiked seed pods in all directions when blown up. But they were completely fictional. \n\nWhen the page loaded, it looked like a normal Wikipedia page. But as I scrolled through it, I saw that it wasn't. It talked about Dragonflame cacti as if they actually exist. It evn talked about how they were used in a terrorist attack on the White House on January 34, 1999. There is no January 34th. There were articles about lightsabers, other dimensions, and Isla Nublar. All things that don’t exist. \n\nWhat do you all think about this? The pages all say they were last updated on February 50, 2021 at 11:59 PM. Again, there is no February 50th. Since it is a HTML file, I can’t view the edit history. The pages look legitimate, but I don't know. It's like Wikipedia pages from dozens of dimensions were put onto a flash drive and put onto a path in a park that doesn’t exist.",

        "text": "Well, this has definitely been the most stressful month of my career. To those of you who had read what was effectively only [the beginning of this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10aabam/something_has_scared_the_wolves/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), and reasonably asked for more info: I’m sorry. I wanted to update you all, to say that things were back to normal, that we were okay, that what happened that night was just a weird joke played on me by the forest. However, that only lasted a few days. Then things got weird again.\n\nWhen Oliver drove back to the hut, he was none the wiser on whatever happened to the wolf we had found. The vet took samples and sent them to a bigger lab somewhere down south and that was it, no definitive answer. After thinking it through, I had decided not to share my weird experience. I only mentioned our wolves being pretty irritable during the previous evening, and he addressed the weird behavior to the smell of death the carcass of the wolf had spread on the immediate area of the hut. I still didn’t know how impressionable Oliver was to anything remotely supernatural, so mentioning those eyes I had seen would’ve only resulted in one of two things: Oliver either doubting my mental state or freaking out and go in an alerted or slightly paranoid state (kinda like mine). None of these possibilities were really good for our work in the days to come, so I kept my mouth shut. However, I would keep an eye on Oliver day by day, to try and understand if he too happened to see something weird or unexplainable. Nothing like that, so in those first few days I started to relax and lay back, ever so slightly. \n\nThen one of the GPS collars sent out a signal, just like last time. I felt a shiver running up my spine, and it was apparent that Oliver felt the same unease. After all, he was the one to find the first dead wolf. It was no surprise to him when I stated that this time we’d be going together, and it was no surprise to me when I saw him grab the rifle and a bunch of 12 gauge slugs, the ones you’d usually expect to unload on a bear charging at you. So yeah, I could see that while he was handling it really masterfully, a small sense of dread and paranoia had already creeped inside Oliver’s mind during our last days.\nWe drove in silence, each of us silently wondering if we were about to retrieve another massacred carcass.\n\nWe did.\n\nBut oh boy was it worse this time.\n\nWe drove as close as we could to the location, but we’d have to climb down a dense, steep incline for the last stretch. Eventually, we were there. Except, there was nothing around us. We were puzzled at first, wondering if the collar had malfunctioned somehow. This made absolutely no sense, though, as the GPS kept on sending out the signal even while we were there. We shuffled around, looking behind each tree in the vicinity. While looking, I started to notice small traces that hinted at something that had passed through there. Something not small at all, too. At first, it was only the big amount of snapped branches on the ground but, to my horror, the bark of the trees showed signs too. Clean slashes, some low near the roots, but others way above my head. Those eyes, the way they rose up…it all flashed in my mind as my paranoia spiked. Then Oliver shouted and cussed, before frantically calling me to reach him. I darted toward his position, only to find him facing a tree, staring at nothing, shivering. I asked him what was going on, before noticing a rather large pool of blood at the base of the tree. As I kept inspecting, I saw how the blood was still kinda fresh, and how the tree too was covered in it. Before I could properly process what I was seeing, Oliver spoke, without moving, without looking at anything.\n\n“Look up.”\n\nSo I did.\n\nUp in the branches, there was a dead wolf, pinned up against the tree. Even in the shock of the moment, the whole seemingly impossible dynamic of what had happened appeared clear: a rather long and thick branch was snapped near its base leaving only a pointed wooden spike, that was then used to pierce the body of the hopefully already deceased animal, leaving it pinned to the tree for whatever reason. Was it there for display? Was it there for later consumption? My head kept racing through all the questions, before reaching the most horrific of possibilities: was this a bait to lure us here? My blood froze, and I stood there in shock and awe, once again feeling exposed and vulnerable. Oliver spoke first, something along the lines of “how are we going to retrieve the carcass?”. Obviously, there was nothing we could have done. We would have to gather some more men and come back with all the gear to climb the tree and safely retrieve what remained of the poor animal.\n\nSo we backed away from the scene, each one of us silently scanning our backs from time to time, scared as hell. We made it back to the pick up, drove back to the hut and called in for reinforcements. The team of climbers showed up to the cabin in the early afternoon, right after another anomaly hit us: the GPS had stopped sending its signal. This simple thing shook us even more, and we found ourselves rather hesitant to wonder why the damn thing stopped working so suddenly. After all, we had a few hours of sunlight at best, and we’d have to make the best of them. So we drove back in a hurry and walked right on the spot. \n\nWe found nothing. No wolf, only blood and guts around the tree and on that damned wooden spike. Surprise soon led to anger and frustration, and Oliver started darting around the place, rifle in hand, looking for any trace of the animal. He was only met with the same immovable silence of the forest, hiding away its secrets, silently laughing at us. The climbers didn’t know how to react. I believe some of them initially thought of it as us trying to prank them, but all the blood evidently washed away every doubt. They remained silent, unsure of what to make of the situation. We decided to give up and go back to the cabin. Still no answer to be found.\n\nThis marked the start of a macabre routine for me and Oliver. Every couple of days, another collar would start beeping. Each time it happened, we prepared for the worst. And each time, we were right. Dead wolves started showing up around the forest, always in seemingly impossible situations, always in pitiful conditions, killed in the most violent and grotesque ways. We found them disemboweled, decapitated, pinned on branches, tore apart. Seeing these wonderful animals reduced to red pulps gutted us to the very core. We never thought we’d see such cruelty on these poor animals, and somehow whatever was doing this kept raising the bar over and over and over with each one of its preys. Our mood worsened, paranoia took over and we started talking less and less, both of us trying to find any sort of answers within ourselves. We decided to stay at the hut without letting anyone else join us for the time being. We didn’t want to put them in any form of danger or stress. We decided that we had to be the ones to see this through. After a few weeks of this we finally noticed another alarming aspect: I had started to pin point the locations of the killings, and it appeared clear as day that they were getting closer, tracing a tighter and tighter circle around the hut.\n\nThat was it, whatever was out there had come right at our gates in the beginning, and then, instead of attacking us head on, had started toying with us for whatever cruel reason. I eventually shared my experience with Oliver, only to be met with anger and pent up aggression. He was right: I should have told him sooner. We decided it was time to abandon the cabin for some time, to prepare our wolves and to transport them somewhere safe, as far as possible. Our last day at the cabin was frantic: Oliver spent the day at the phone, trying to arrange a transportation and a new home for our residents, while I darted around the place getting everything ready and packed up. We were absolutely crushed when the personnel responsible for moving the wolves announced that they would only be able to reach us the following morning. This meant one more night in the frontline. The last one hopefully.\n\nObviously, it couldn’t have been that easy. It was around 8pm that I noticed something that nearly cracked me: the collective and violent growling of our wolves. Me and Oliver shared an horrified look. He bolted up, reached for the rifle and ran at the door, peeking through the glass panels. I made my way to him, and he instructed me to open the door while aimed down the sights. We stepped outside. Artemis, Ice, Tia and Dawn were on high alert, ferociously growling at the tree line outside their fence. Eventually, something massive moved and shuffled in the dark. It was enough to send Oliver in a panicked rage, and he unloaded his first round in the general direction of the movement we had just heard. The wolves went quiet. Everything did.\n\nThen, the most atrocious and wild shriek we’d ever heard rose from the tree line. All our wolves cowered back in fear and retreated to their enclosures. In the midst of all the chaos, the shuffling resumed louder and something suddenly flew from the darkness of the trees right at us, hitting the side of the hut mere steps away from us. In the glow of the service lights we saw that it was yet another wolf carcass. Oliver shrieked back, charging and unloading shots as fast as possible while we darted back in the cabin. Once inside, we heard the horrible wail continue a little more, getting less and less loud, before silence once again fell on us. We spent the rest of the night in total paranoia, continuously looking out the windows, screaming and shooting at every hint of movement around us. By dawn, we were exhausted, pretty much dead inside. We only managed to let out a sigh of relief when the team that would help us move the wolves showed up earlier than we thought. By then, we had already hidden the body of the wolf that was thrown at us, and we had tried our best to unwind from the terrifying night we had just lived through. I guess it didn’t help much, though, as demonstrated by the confused looks on the guys’ face each time we’d jump at any noise and each time one of us would momentarily phase out to scan the area around us. \n\nEventually, the wolves were gone, hopefully headed to a safer place. We stayed in silence once again, pondering our options. We felt like what had happened last night wasn’t a proper attack. It was a sort of final warning. None of us could tell if it meant whether that thing wanted us gone or wanted us dead. Part of us wanted answers, some kind of justice. But part of us wanted to live. The forest kept its secret hidden, still probably laughing at us. We had a dream, a mission. Shutting the doors of the hut felt like huge a defeat, but at least it was a defeat we’d be able to talk about. Whatever was in the woods, we left it there for the time being. The option of facing that thing requires a shit ton of preparation, men willing to chase an unknown white whale and all of our courage. \nWe’ll get there, eventually. \nJust not today.",

        "text": "I've always been fascinated by the supernatural. Ghost stories, urban legends, and unsolved mysteries always had a way of drawing me in. But I never truly believed in any of it. That is, until I moved into my current apartment.\n\nAt first, it seemed like any other place I'd ever lived in. A small one-bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood. But as soon as I moved in, things started to feel off. It started with small things, like objects being moved around or strange noises in the middle of the night. I brushed it off as just my imagination or the settling of an old building.\n\nBut as time went on, things got worse. I started having vivid nightmares that left me feeling drained and anxious. I would wake up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat and with a feeling of dread in my stomach. And then, one night, I saw it.\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night, as usual, and turned over to grab my phone. But as I did, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was a figure, standing at the foot of my bed. It was dark, almost like a shadow, but I could make out the shape of a person. I froze, not sure what to do. I blinked, and it was gone.\n\nAfter that, I couldn't sleep. Every night, I would lie awake, staring at the ceiling, waiting for something to happen. And something always did. I would hear footsteps in the hallway, doors opening and closing, and strange whispers that I couldn't quite make out.\n\nOne night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I set up a camera in my bedroom and left it recording all night. In the morning, I eagerly checked the footage, hoping for some kind of explanation. But what I saw left me more confused than ever.\n\nThe footage was filled with strange images and sounds. The door to my bedroom opening and closing on its own. The shadowy figure I had seen before, hovering over my bed. And the whispers, louder and more menacing than ever. But there was no explanation for any of it. No sign of anyone else in the apartment.\n\nI tried to leave, but I couldn't. It was like something was holding me there, keeping me trapped in this nightmare. I started to feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn't concentrate at work, I stopped eating, and I was barely sleeping at all.\n\nBut then, one night, everything changed. I woke up to find the shadowy figure standing at the foot of my bed once again. But this time, it didn't disappear. It just stood there, watching me. I felt paralyzed, unable to move or speak.\n\nAnd then, something strange happened. The figure started to fade, becoming less and less solid. And then, it was gone. And with it, all of the strange noises and feelings of dread that had been haunting me for so long.\n\nI don't know what happened that night. Maybe the figure was just a figment of my imagination, or maybe it was something more. All I know is that I can sleep again, and for that, I'm grateful. But I'll never forget the fear and uncertainty that I felt during those long, sleepless nights in that old apartment.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, you may be thinking \"Why cant we go in the woods alone hunters go there!\" Its safer not to go in the woods, so you wont encounter what lurks in there.\n\nI lived in a very quiet town, not much things happen there, it was pretty peaceful.\n\nOne time I decided to go hunting cause I wanted to pick it up as a hobby, I started hunting like it was an everyday thing, I even made friends. One time my friends decided to dare me to go hunting at night all alone. I decided to agree cause they kept pushing me, anyway here is when It starts to get serious. So it was a dark night, pretty quiet knowing it was a sunday night making it a school night. everyone had work in the morning, alot of people had school typical stuff. It was 10:35 PM, I was exploring thinking nothing could go wrong.\n\nIt was 12:00, and i still haven't found anything. It was 2 AM I decided to just go home and go hunting in the morning, but i heard something very unusual, I didn't recognize it. I soon found a cave. but i decided not to go cause i was really scared. I tried leaving but as soon as I left i saw a very large shadowy creature with horns. Its face looked like a skull not just one, there was multiple around me. I felt so scared i couldn't even move.\n\nI dropped my rifle as i trembled in fear. They were getting closer and closer.\n\nI managed to run away but they were fast, very fast. I couldn't outrun them so I decided to hide in a bush hoping I wouldn't be found. I was so scared i couldn't move a single muscle. I fell asleep. I woke up in the morning and i ran to my car.\n\n2 weeks later i decided to return t o that same cave, searching. I was searching for hours for those creatures, It was night again, I decided to leave and go next time, but as soon as I did I saw them, I quickly took out my camera to take pictures, And I grabbed my rifle and opened fire. It was doing nothing so I decided I would just run. of course i couldn't outrun them so i decided to hide in another bush and suprisingly it worked, I woke up and it was morning again, I decided to look at the pictures and keep them.\n\nI was driving back home and then I taped the pictures i took to the wall.\n\nI decided to go back a third time with a squad, we were prepared. With night vision modern weapons and everything, We were desperate to take them down as they are to dangerous for them to live. We searched for hours and we found them. We saw what they looked like and we were shocked. It didn't have a face. It was completely black with red glowing eyes. It looked like it was smiling at us, We quickly opened fire and then we brang out better weapons, they decided to retreat but we followed them, They ran into the mysterious cave but we followed them, Only to be suprised on what we saw will haunt me to this day.\n\nWe saw hundreds of those shadowy creatures living in that mysterious cave.\n\nOne of our squad members said, So this is where the live.\n\nWe decided to open fire and they were cornered, but they decided to fight back so we had to use flamethrowers, They seemed to be scared of the flamethrowers because of the light its creating.\n\nSquad Member 1: So thats their weakness.\n\nSquad member 2: Everybody use your flamethrowers now!\n\nWe all used our flamethrowers and the cave lit up, They were terrified of the light, we got closer and closer until all of the creatures started shouting in pain and melted into nothing, it was just like it just dissapeared and was no where to be found, One by one we kept going until a taller shadowy creature came in that wasn't terrified of the light the flamethrowers were creating. We were horrified, it took us down one by one, but luckily only one died. we got away but we decided to never go back to that cave or ever go back in the woods.\n\nWeeks later the remaining squad members and I left the country, We all live together and we decided to never talk about what we saw ever again.\n\nTo this day we are still traumatized to what we saw.",

        "text": "There is something I haven't told anyone in my life. I don't know who to share it with, so I feel doing it here might help. This might be slightly long, so please bear with me. \n\n\nI belong to a small city in India. The incident I am going to talk about, happened 17 years ago in 2006. Before I talk about the incident, I have to give a little background to the paternal side of my family. \n\n\nMy grandfather was a police officer. He worked all over the state and finally decided to settle in a small village located in one of the northern districts of the state. My father has 4 brothers (two elder and two younger) and 4 sisters (one elder and three younger). They were a pretty big family, but after the daughters got married, the sons decided to leave the village to start their life somewhere else, except the second son. He along with his wife and son decided to stay back in the village and live with my grandparents. \n\n\nOur village had a college, which was a popular educational institute for the area, including the nearby districts. Now my uncle's sister in law, Deepa, got admitted into this college in 2004 and started living with them. I guess the duration of the course was 3 years. She was a bright student and did well in college too. Our whole family used to get together in our village during the months of October-November, to celebrate the festival of Durga Puja. We had met her too and we were fond of her. She was shy yet really nice to talk to. She used to play with us and also tell us stories from her childhood. \n\n\nEarly 2006 is when tragedy struck. Deepa suffered from high fever one night. The doctor in the village told them to take her to a bigger hospital because it looked serious. Turns out she was suffering from brain malaria. By the time they reached the hospital, the doctor said it was now beyond their control. She passed away in the hospital within a couple of days. It was a shock because she was really young and it does feel sad when someone you've interacted and bonded with passes away. \n\n\nOctober came, and it was time for our family get-together. Now let me tell you the layout of our village house. It was a pretty big house in the shape of a square. On one corner was an entry passageway, the corner diagonally opposite to that was the exit to the huge backyard that we had. On the other two corners, there were two big bedrooms. Now everyone was in the house. One night after dinner, most of us were in one of the corner bedrooms chilling, some had gone to sleep, the other bedroom at the corner was empty. Suddenly my cousin, who was around 5 years old then came into the room and asked \"where will she sleep?\" \n\nThe elders were confused. They enquired. He said \"that aunty in the other room\"\n\nAll of us went to the room to check. No one. \n\nHe was asked what she looked like. He was unable to describe her properly but said that she was wearing a floral nightgown. I could see the faces of the elders freeze. He had somewhat described what Deepa was wearing on her last day here. No one slept that night (or at least I think so because I slept off). The next morning everyone left. That night my cousin suffered from very high fever and he was almost on the verge of passing out. The medicines were not working. Everyone was extremely worried. \n\n\nA couple of days later, his fever started to go down a little. My aunt went to give him some medicines and she saw him play with what looked like a gold ring. She asked him how did he get it and he said \"the blue nightgown aunty gave me\" \n\nHe said, that night when he met her, she had given him the ring. He had hidden it in his pocket thinking he would be scolded then. \n\n\nNow all of us went back to the village, this had become an emergency meeting of sorts. My aunt i.e Deepa's elder sister admitted that she had stored some of her belongings in a small bag and placed it in a storage space that is at the top of that corner room where she was seen. It was impossible for a full grown adult to reach the space without a ladder, so a 6 year old reaching that spot was out of the question. \n\n\nA priest was consulted. He conducted a few rituals, where at the end he put the ring back in the back, tied it down with a black thread and placed it in a burning pyre. He said that her spirit has gone away now. All of us were convinced about it. \n\n\nThis is why I am sharing this story. Now everyone knows about my cousin getting the ring, but what they don't know is that the night before that, a kid had woken up in the middle of the night to go to the washroom and he saw Deepa standing at the backdoor. Deepa gave him a silver locket and then went through the door to the backyard. The kid looked out through the window but could only see a blanket of darkness outside. The kid was scared out of his wits but was also excited. He decided to not tell about it to anyone. You must have already guessed who the kid is, isn't it?\n\n\nNow I thought I would tell my mother back then, but I thought she might be harmed, so I kept this like my little secret and I always kept the locket with me. About 17 years have passed since the incident and I have moved to one of the biggest cities of the country. Recently, I started hearing voices and my sleep paralysis attacks have increased in frequency. I had them regularly since I was a kid, but now it happens almost everyday. Whenever I am alone in the house, I do get a feeling that there is someone else in the room. I haven't exactly experienced anything, but something feels wrong in my gut. \n\n\nWhat should I do? Should I tell my family or should I talk to some priest and try to see what can be done?",

        "text": "How We Got Here: https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/110rtav/eye_for_an_eye/\n\n'The Dutch Connection'\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBad news. The late Angela Ackerman's camera, the CF card and everything on it... gone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomething's been bothering me from the very start of this whole insane situation. I just couldn't put my finger on it. Here are the facts; Angela was murdered either intentionally or accidentally. Motive unknown. Police investigation, useless. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomehow, through a random series of yellow lights and banana peels, I end up with her camera. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'd never consider myself someone who believes in ghosts but it became pretty clear there was something going on with this camera that science couldn't explain. It was showing images, almost burnt into the CF card of what seriously looked like Angela's untimely demise. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI traced the camera back to a couple of scumbags who knew Angela personally. We got into a fight, they tried to take the camera back and inexplicably the camera, seemingly all on it's own blinded them sufficiently to be run over by a car.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I got home things got even stranger when the CF card re-wrote itself with a whole new set of images; Angela's grave, a bloody axe, the scumbags being run over and pictures of what google tells me are tulips... one of them black. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSeeing as how the CF card and all my digital backups so inconveniently decided to transform, I had the clever idea to print hard copies of the newest batch. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI bought a printer, paper and some extra color ink. (Side Note: If whatever it is I'm doing doesn't work out I'm going into the printer ink business because it's a racket.) I print out copies of around a dozen key images and pin them up on the wall. Not sure what I was looking for exactly. Something out of place? It's all out of place. Something that could point me in the right direction maybe? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe only potential landmarks were Angela's grave, where her body was found and somewhere where they sell... tulips? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe grave and where she was found were matters of public record. The thought crossed my mind the tulips may be by her headstone but that was impossible because we've had the snowiest fall and winter in East coast history. Ain't no tulips surviving that. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd to be frank I didn't have much of a stomach to visit either place. It's too tragic. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhich brings us to tulips. Oh my god. So much information about tulips. The history of them being imported from Asia and landing in Europe and becoming one of the first great financial bubbles when the price of a Dutch tulip could buy you a house... this research is going nowhere fast. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe problem is I can't tell what's meaningful from what's not. I needed an expert. Fortunately, as it turns out there are quite a few of them. There's even a tulip museum about 45 minutes away. Their website even had a black tulip on the homepage. Best of all admission is free for students (I'm pretty sure I have an old student ID somewhere in my mess of a closet. Our movie theater used to do half off for students pre-pandemic. Ah, the days.) \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd that's when it hit me. I was in such shock the night of the accident, when the skeeze-oids were mowed down, there are a few details I might not have processed right. Also, look, I have sympathy for the guys who were run over. It sucks. And the drivers are undoubtedly gonna pay a steep price emotionally.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I didn't lure them into the street. They were trying to rob me. And based on the fact that a freaking possessed ghost camera pretty much incapacitated them in time to get hit by a car... for all I know they're murderers. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo what I failed to consider that night is four fold; 1) I have texts with one of the victims specifically designating the time and place we meet. 2) A whole handful of witnesses who saw me leave after the guys went out the back. 3) The driver of the car had to have seen the camera flashing. 4) Had to see me run off with the camera. That last point I know because I saw them clear as day.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is a serious incident and it's not going to take a Hercule Pirot to figure out I was a witness and may have crucial information. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo sooner than I have that thought is there a knock at the door. Two detectives with badges hanging on a chain around their neck and a lady who looked like a lawyer. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI took a deep breath and opened the door. No sooner did I do that did I remember the freaking pictures are STILL ON THE WALL. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe detectives came in followed by the lawyer lady. Turns out she's not a lawyer but an insurance investigator. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI tried to take the pictures down as quick as I could but it was way too late. The insurance lady spotted the photo of the d-bag, Drift. She pulls it down and asks if she can have it. I mean, cat's out of the bag at this point. Why the hell not. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile the detectives asked me where I was, what I saw and what was the circumstance of my being there, I told them everything. Everything accept for Angela. I explained I was in shock, I was afraid for my life after being kicked in the gut and I panicked and ran. All of which is true.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nInsurance lady spotted Angela's beat up camera and asked if it was the one that took the photos. I said it was. She asked if she could have it for further examination. I said no way. Not happening. I'm a photographer and it's my business (never mind the fact the camera, lens and flash were nearly destroyed). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe detectives said they could get a warrant since ths was an ongoing investigation. They made it very clear if that's the route I wanted to go, when they came back they would literally tear my apartment to shreds looking for evidence, for which I don't have. It wasn't even a veiled threat. It was threat threat with a capital T. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd that's the story abouyt how I lost the camera, my printouts the CF card. I still have dropbox backups but, with the camera gone... I'm not even sure what I'm after anymore. Maybe the police will look at it and Angela will reveal herself to them instead. Let the professionals handle it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis isn't my responsibility. Okay that's all for now. I'm waiting for the Dutch Tulip Connection tour to start at the Memorial Art Gallery. I don't expect anything to come from this except maybe seeing some flowers.",

        "text": "When I was 11 years old, I had a peculiar experience that remains vivid in my memory, even 29 years later. It was an ordinary day, just like any other. My mother, grandmother, and I had gone to the local grocery store in our small town in Southwest Missouri. The trip was uneventful, as usual, but it felt like an eternity before we returned home.\n\nAs we drove back, the sun had just begun to set. I could still see fairly well, but I was eager to get home. When we arrived, my mother exclaimed, \"Trixie is out!\" Trixie was our family's large female Rottweiler. Looking in the direction she pointed, it indeed appeared like our dog was outside. However, my mother was worried that Trixie might see us and run across the highway, potentially putting herself in danger.\n\nIn a panic, I jumped on my bicycle and raced towards my grandparents' house, which was across the highway from our home. After a minute or so of cycling, I spotted a large, black creature. It was not a dog, nor was it a bear. I had no idea what it could be.\n\nAs I approached the creature, I locked up the brakes on my bike, causing it to skid sideways and crash to the ground. The creature then turned and looked straight at me. I froze in fear as the creature frantically ran and jumped over a barbed wire fence, disappearing into the woods.\n\nI quickly regained my composure, mounted my bike, and raced back to where my mother and grandmother were unloading groceries. I told them about what I had seen, but they were just as puzzled as I was. Trixie was in the yard, so they knew it wasn't our dog.\n\nThe sighting of the unknown creature sent shivers down my spine, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. The image of the creature's eyes glaring at me was seared into my memory, and it haunted me for many sleepless nights.\n\nDespite my terror, I continued to explore the very same woods where I had seen the creature. I never encountered anything else like it again, but stories in the area persisted of a black panther or a family of large black cats. However, I had never seen any evidence of such creatures, and I was pretty sure that I would have recognized a panther if I had seen one.\n\nAs I grew older, I continued to venture into the wilderness to hunt and fish in Missouri, but I never encountered any such animal again. This experience, though terrifying, taught me that the world is full of creatures that we don't understand, and it made me appreciate the mysteries of the natural world even more.\n\nLooking back, I realize how strange it was that my family and I were never able to identify what I saw that day. There are plenty of possibilities that could explain what I encountered, but I will never truly know. Despite the years that have passed, I still vividly remember the moment I saw the creature. The size and color of the animal were so distinct that it was unlike anything I had ever seen before.\n\nAs a child, I was always interested in wildlife, so it wasn't unusual for me to go exploring in the woods by myself. I knew the area like the back of my hand, so when I saw something that didn't fit, it was extremely unnerving.\n\nI've thought a lot about what it could have been. I've heard stories of black panthers, mountain lions, and even escaped exotic pets in the area, but I'll never be able to say for sure what I saw. Even though it's been almost 30 years, the incident still feels fresh in my mind, and I can still see the creature's black coat.",

        "text": "Teleportation, or “Plunging” and Psychokinesis are real.\n\nI am proof of that.\n\nThanks to the brutal experiments myself and my colleagues have been put through, I no longer consider us human.\n\n…\n\nJuly 2020.\n\nI want to start this post telling you how I woke up face-down in the shallows, my blood diffusing water I was half submerged in.\n\nI was part static nothing, and part flesh, pieces of skin caught between my new teeth and a sour taste in my mouth. Honestly, it would be easier for me to get right into it and detail the horrific testing which has fucked with my head, taking away my humanity. First I have to tell you about Plunging. If I had to describe it  in technical terms—or at least what I can think of from the top of my head, I would say it’s like being caught in a nuclear explosion coming from within your own body. One minute I was clutching a motionless Kaian for dear life, the next, swamped in glistening wave-like light as the plunge sucked all reality from the hotel room, ripping my colleague from my grasp.\n\nI remember being fully aware of his body splintering into glistening atoms floating in the air like glitter—and the childish part of me which was almost high from this sensation wanted to laugh and envelope my hands in Kaian’s remnants. \n\nIt would later be referred to as our backseat residue, but at that point I just saw it as… stuff. Glitter. Snow. Tiny water droplets. \n\nBefore I knew it, though, I was next. \n\nI didn’t exactly feel my own body be swallowed up initially. When talking about it with my therapist, I describe the sensation as imploding inside myself. Like a blackhole had appeared within me and was slowly disembowelling my being. The next moment I was… nothing. I was nothing, and I belonged to nothing.\n\nI have always wondered what oblivion feels like. As a kid, I looked into the night sky and wondered just how vast it was—and how many stars there were. The Plunge was my answer.\n\nPlunging was like being thrust into a whole different oblivion where nothing was real, only you in that moment. Time does not exist. Light and dark does not exist. There was only pain like I had never felt before. It was excruciating, agony, the feeling of every bone snapping in two and shattering into atoms, organs bursting, imploding, and coming together and apart, everything inside me shattering into a blackhole, until I was nothing but matter with barely a consciousness clinging on. I can’t fully describe what Plunging meant for my body without going mad. But I can tell you what I saw in the initial experiments with rabbits. \n\nWhich is essentially what happened to us. \n\nPlunging, also teleportation, was not stable in any subject, causing each of them to rupture and come apart as soon as The Plunge began. As a researcher, I watched this happen. I watched the first subjects immediately reject The Plunge and explode on impact. With following subjects, it seemed to be getting better, almost like the phenomenon itself was learning. After losing half of our subjects, we did get hints that it was starting to work. But not the way you would think. \n\nWe got results, of course. But these results weren’t exactly promising. Yes, Plunging, also teleportation, was possible. Except only certain parts of the rabbits were being transferred from the primary location to the destination. So, instead of getting fully whole rabbits at the receiving end, there were only gory, fleshy chunks and heads with no eyes. The Plunge did not just tear them apart physically, it altered them in ways neither of us could begin to understand. They would come back, with two or three of them merged together, eyes missing, tongues longer, sometimes entirely inside out missing vital pieces. \n\nNot just physically either. Some rabbits who were mostly whole would try and bite us and grow erratic, climbing the metal prongs of their cage. We did, however, end up succeeding once the serum was modified and injected into a half dead subject. Professor Quincy had q learned that the serum didn’t seem to work on a live subject. It was only when the subject was dead or dying when the serum kicked in.\n\nWith the four survivors of the Plunging experiments, we began tests to measure how far they could teleport, and their reaction times. Each of them had a safe place where their mind would take them during Plunging to protect them—which would usually be the cage they were initially brought in, or certain parts of the laboratory where they experienced the best treatment (Jem used to feed them carrot sticks, so three out of four of them saw their safe place to be where Jem usually stood. There were significant changes with the subjects, after the first successful plunge, however. For those already inhabiting blossoming psychokinetic abilities, these rabbits stopped fighting the serum all together, and seemed to submit to Quincy’s torture. \n\nBefore surgery, they would squirm and bite and have to be sedated before testing. But after Plunging, they seemed to lose all of their fight altogether. Their brain waves were significantly different, and they stopped eating. Kaian remarked that it was like having zombie rabbits, and I had to agree. They may have been alive, after being brought back to life repeatedly through surgery and scrambling their brains, but Plunging had awakened something inside of them, something irreversible, that I pretended not to see. \n\nBecause if I stopped to look properly, switching on my humanity against my professor’s orders, then I would have realised we had created monsters we were in denial of—monsters who were  slowly gaining sentience and developing a significant taste.\n\nI haven’t forgotten when a rabbit sent an orderly crashing into the wall with its mind.\n\nNow. Imagine that, but this time in humans.\n\nI had no idea just how similar, and yet drastically different, it would be in human subjects. I already knew it would hurt. I had to turn away during our initial testing on animal subjects, because they screamed—even without the ability to cry and scream like a human, I still heard it in their squeaking and their crying. This is why we were told to turn our backs on being human and moral and good people. \n\nThat was, until the same thing was happening to us. At this point I had already experienced Plunging, however small the test was—and despite not being myself during it. My colleagues and I were the first experimental human subjects to successfully Plunge—and that was April 2020. That was when our professor might have had the slightest semblance of humanity clinging on, before he began to subject us to far cruller experiments far beyond what the rabbits went through. \n\nIn my last post, I detailed the fact that Kaian was fucked up beyond repair due to what has been done to him. And  in this post I will elaborate on what exactly happened to us. Before I can go into the experiments that started everything, however, I will begin in July 2020. \n\nExactly half a second (It felt like half a second) after Plunging from the hotel room, being torn away from my colleagues and splintering into several singularities, ripped apart again and again and again, until part of me, the conscious part of me, found my safe place. Like the rabbits, during trauma which their minds cannot comprehend, human’s will find their safe place—and mine was the shallows on the beach by the lab. I had always dreamed about it during captivity. It was the closest to home. If I imagined myself standing ankle deep on the very edge of the shallows and staring across the glistening ocean blue, I could delude myself into believing one single step would take me home and free me from the endless hell I was being forced to endure. \n\nWe all had our own safe places once Quincy officially declared us as successes. Riss’s was behind the door in the lab by the communal area where she spent most of her time as a human, Kaian’s was in the hallway where he could see the sun and the wide expanse of blue sky, and Jem’s was in storage with the rabbit cages where he would sneak in as a human to either feed them carrot sticks or open their cages and cradle them to sleep (despite being told multiple times not to grow an attachment to the subjects). \n\nAfter being swallowed up by Kaian and Riss’s collective energies combined, creating a Plunge powerful enough to rip away reality in that room, I found myself exactly where I wanted to be. I was at the beach. To be specific, right near the coves where my colleagues and I used to have picnics and paddle in bioluminescent plankton as humans.\n\nPlunging didn’t exactly give me an option how I would land, and if I would make impact in the physical plane at all. I was nothing, just scattered atoms, an outline of a human figure which enough physical elements to allow me to stumble and staggered, tumbling through folds of energy glittering in air crackling with energy. It’s like walking in the air, except you don’t have legs or arms, or even a body. You are just there, as atoms, slowly being pieced back together again.  \n\nReality does not like Plunging. \n\nEvery time one of us slips through, the ground rumbles like mother nature herself is screaming at us to stop. After several attempts to land, and then finally slamming into damp sand, I struggled to get a hold of myself and my body. I was whole. Mostly. \n\nOnce my senses were back, I had a semblance of myself. I could hear the soft waves crashing into the shore. I had to press my face into the sand, waiting for my right eye to grow back, but already my body was working against me. I knew what came next. After my flesh grew back, stitching itself back onto my bones, static energy becoming blood and bone and muscle, I would begin the hunt. \n\nYou see, when humans burn up a colossal amount of energy, they need to find a way to get it back via nutrients. Plunging was essentially being ripped apart and put back together, creating a whole new body. \n\nAnd I was hungry. I was so hungry, once the palms of my hands were physical enough to feel, I bit into them, tearing into my own flesh.  I can’t remember much of it. It’s like a dream. I waited until I was no longer glittering particles and static body parts, before jumping to my feet. The man was local, and easy to find. I didn’t have to do much, I think he was listening to music, completely oblivious of my presence. \n\nIt took two strides for me to grab him, snap his neck, and sink my teeth into his flesh, tearing it from his bones until I was satisfied. I was never satisfied. There was never enough human flesh to find—and I couldn’t control myself. After Plunging, we develop an insatiable hunger which drove me mad until I ate something. In the lab, we were force fed every food imaginable, but nothing really stuck until Quincy started feeding us pieces of local’s.\n\nThey tasted like salt, but the good kind. The kind which quenched that itching and relentless burning in the back of my throat. Professor Quincy called it a “mistake he could fix”. Though I knew even he was completely stumped on why these instincts were awakened inside of us. Looking back, I know it was intentional. \n\nThe asshole intended to turn us into monsters, into freaks he could put on a leash and parade around like the freaks we were. Back then though, part of me wanted to believe he could fix that so called mistake. I want to tell you I was in a trance while feeding, and that I couldn’t help it. That part is true. Though I was fully conscious throughout—and no matter what I tried to do, stop my own bloody hands tearing skin off of bones and plunging into glistening gore, I had no control over myself. I was halfway through the man, chewing my way through his guts, when the fog lifted from my eyes. \n\nLike I was in a trance, I awake, feeling sick to my stomach and shaky. My immediate reaction was to purge what I’d eaten, but I didn’t have time for that. Throwing the man into the sea, my first thought was to go back to the lab for the others before it hit me that I was outside for the first time in six months. I was actually free.\n\nI didn’t have people around me, or an electronic collar around my neck forcing me to stay where I was. Looking down at myself, I was covered, painted in the man’s blood. It splattered my mouth and chin, and the taste and stink of human blood made me want to gag. \n\nThe sky was black. Night-time. It was so peaceful, and as I slowly waded into the shallows to wash myself down, I couldn’t stop thinking about the dead man’s family who had no idea of their loss. Dizzy, barely conscious, and struggling in my new body, I was half considering diving into the ocean and swimming out to where the sea collided with oblivion, when I glimpsed something floating several feet away. \n\nWhen I started towards it, I realised it wasn’t floating, and not a something. It was a someone. I only needed to see dark brown hair, and the familiar pale blue of the hospital gown we had been forced to wear, to know it was Kaian. My colleague was curled up in a cove, soft waves pushing him closer to shore. \n\nWhen I knelt next to him and reached out, grazing my fingers over his arms—he wasn’t fully formed yet. He was close, but his skin was still slowly knitting itself back together, taking its time sketching out his eyes, nose and mouth in strokes of unearthly, blinding light.\n\nI once saw it in a rabbit, this process, and I remember describing it as beautiful. Like God himself was creating living things once again. I watched the rabbit start as nothing but particles in the air, blossoming into an outline throwing thicker, growing flesh and fur.\n\nIt’s weird being both an ex- researcher and a subject. I got to witness and document it, only to experience it months later.\n\nBut seeing it with Kaian, and knowing the same thing happened to me, it turned my gut knowing I wasn’t seeing his original body. Kaian’s original body had been lost during the first Plunge, and so had mine. I found myself wondering, with every Plunge, and every time the universe copied us into existence, were we losing more and more of ourselves? \n\nTouching him was like enveloping my fingers in static, or maybe stars. It looked like he was glitching, half real and half not. I waited until he was physical enough for me to wrap my arms around him, lifting him and holding him to my chest. I could already sense a heartbeat, as well as his familiar energy enveloping him. \n\nIf he wanted to, and if he was awake, my colleague could have sent me hurtling into the sea with one flick of his wrist. From how he had been acting pre-plunge, I had no doubt he wasn’t going to do that. \n\nKaian hadn’t plunged, thanks to me snapping his neck before the two of us were swallowed up. So, while Riss and I had been through the brunt of it, our third colleague had just been a passenger with me. Kaian wasn’t as heavy as I initially thought. I figured with his body coming back together, there would be added weight, but it was like carrying a feather. Stumbling back onto the shore, with my colleague’s head sandwiched against my chest, I felt relief for the first time. “Hey, Kaian.” Jolting my arms, I allowed myself to smile, pointedly ignoring my gory hands clutching my colleague for dear life. Riss’s safe place was at the lab, so I had no doubt she was there, and getting her back was going to be a problem. “Are you awake?” I held my breath. “Don’t kill me, okay? I had to.”\n\nHe responded with a grunt, which was enough for me to let out a breath of relief.\n\nI hadn’t forgotten that he had disembowelled a fully grown man with his mind, and outright told me he liked to Plunge.\n\nThat was something I was pushing to the back of my head, though. For once, I wanted to focus on the cool night air grazing my skin, a slight breeze playing with my hair. Kaian didn’t answer, but I knew he was awake. His breathing had quickened, and I could feel his breath against my skin. “Chill out,” I murmured, aware of his body seizing up. “Happy birthday, okay? I want you to sing it in your head. Three times.”\n\nHis hand shot out, and I panicked for a moment thinking he was going to send me careening into the air. Instead though, he just signed, “No.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because…” His hands were struggling with signing, and my chest ached. Still the same old Kaian, and yet also drastically different. “Because no.”\n\nStubborn bastard.\n\nI rolled my eyes, enjoying the feeling of sand between my toes. God, I had fucking dreamed about it. “Your loss.” I told Kaian. “If you Plunge, I’m letting go of you, and I won’t hesitate dropping you in the sea.” I found myself smiling. I hadn’t smiled in so long. God, it felt good. Ignoring his protests, I strode into the shallows once again, allowing each wave to wave over my ankles. The plankton was faded, but definitely noticeable. My memories were still unstable and not quite right from the experiments, but I did remember pieces of our time before being subjects. \n\nI remembered laying back on the sand under a full moon while Riss and Jem splashed around like little kids, Kaian bringing out his telescope to map out constellations. I doubted his state of mind cared about stuff like that anymore, which was a painful realisation. All he cared about was bodying people with his fucked up mind.  My colleague didn’t speak for a while, and I enjoyed the silence.\n\nAfter what felt like hours of staring at the sky, a thought came to me.\n\n“Have you… eaten?” I signed awkwardly with my hands.\n\n“No.”\n\nRegardless of Plunging or not, both of us needed to find food before our bodies took control of our minds.\n\n“Are you hungry?”\n\nHe hesitated, before signing, “I’m hungry for food.”\n\n“Liar. Do you want me to let you go?”\n\nHe twisted around to glare at me. “I’m barely conscious!”\n\n “Well, maybe the sea will wake you up.”\n\nI thought he was going to sign something insulting, but instead my colleagues body jerked, and I sensed his animal instincts bleeding into fruition. That was the Kaian I was scared of—who sensed someone coming, and his immediate reaction was to blow their brain to pieces.\n\nIt  wasn’t a stranger though. I could already sense their familiarity and their scent.\n\nMy body, however, was already going into panic mode. Which triggered plunging. The force of each footstep towards us  felt like a tidal wave of heat. I could sense Kaian trying to use his ability, but he was too weak. So was I. Even after eating, I had to sleep and rest my new body before I could even think about burning myself up again with plunging. Still though, I could sense a threat—which had my toes curling, a sour bile creeping its way up my throat. When the sleek metal butt of a Glock protruded into the back of my head, I knew there was nobody holding it. \n\nThe air was suddenly suffocating, and at the corner of my eye I could glimpse a flicker of light sparking in the air. I could feel it once again, stripping at the sand beneath my feet and playing with the ocean. Kaian didn’t move, but his skin was already scalding hot.\n\nIf I concentrated, the air in front of me was starting to spark and ignite with his ability.\n\nRun, I thought hysterically. The gun hung in the air around me like a tease, before finding my right and then left temple. If I concentrated, I could sense his pressure on the trigger. “Down.” The voice slicing through the air sent shivers through me, and Kaian let out a sharp hiss.\n\nThe word had weight to it, and my body instantly reacted to it, automatically submitting.\n\nWhen he repeated it, I did what he said, and dropped to my knees. The gun followed me, grazing across the back of my skull like it thrilled him to see us helpless. If I could figure out where exactly he was without twisting around, I should have been able to at least stall him by sending him flying into the shallows. Like he had read my mind, however, his palmy hands were coming down to squeeze my shoulders, and I was reminded what Seth had taken us away from. Being sold as guard dogs was one thing, but being put on auction to become guinea pigs for the world’s elite and top scientists was something I couldn’t even comprehend. \n\nI had the ability to pop the asshole’s brain, and I couldn’t. Behind me, I glimpsed a van awaiting us—and from the static electricity crackling in the air, our fourth colleague had been caught.\n\n“Asshole.” Kaian gritted through his teeth. It was rare when he spoke. I don’t think I’d ever heard him speak. Only when he was begging the professor to stop us from plunging in the initial trials, when he’d lost the ability to use his hands. He weakly lifted his arm, which I knew was going to cause damage. Being the most powerful out of all of us, and well as the one who was most in touch with the psychokinetic ability, mixed with the fact that his brain was scrambled from relentless torture, made Kaian the most dangerous and unpredictable. After Plunging though, he was as weak as any other normal human. \n\nLike me, he needed to eat.  Before he could attack, his whole body jolted, his wrist snapping with a sound which sent my gut into my throat. When my colleague let out a guttural cry, I gave up. What was the point in fighting?\n\nI could sense that little furry bastard at our attacker’s side.\n\nFifteen.\n\n“Alright guys,” Jem stabbed the gun into the back of my head once again, and this time I dropped Kaian, who crumpled to the ground. He didn’t try to get up, and I knew why. Unfortunately, my colleague had a weakness. And despite being stripped of his humanity, Kaian still had that weakness.  Jem’s monotone voice was worse than that he was using his ability against us, another rough crack of the gun sending me to my feet. Just like what Fifteen had done to his brain, twisting and warping it into submission, he was doing the exact same to us. His next words dragged the breath from my lungs and I wanted to scream. He spoke like we had a choice. Like the laboratory was our solace.\n\n“Let’s go home.”\n\n…\n\nApril 2020.\n\nThe memory started out like a breath of fresh air. I was back home on campus, far away from the island. I was back to civilisation, back to late night Starbucks and bus rides which made me nauseous. Even the sight of traffic which usually pissed me off, filled me with the kind of joy I thought I’d lost.  It was just a typical day before I scored the researcher job with Professor Quincy. Late 2019. \n\nI saw dogs on the street and ducked to pet them, scrolled through Instagram, and read way too many news articles to and from campus. Though as soon as I was starting to sink into my own private solace, imagining my parents and my home, I was being thrust into a memory which crept up on me, eliciting a shiver down my spine. It was night, and I was on campus. \n\nI was never on campus after work-hours. As a recent graduate, I had only just managed to slide into a temporary researcher position with a professor I had forgotten the name of. Not exactly what I wanted to be doing with my life, but it was a job, and something I was good at. The corridor was pitch black, partially illuminated by the flashlight on my phone. There was a twenty dollar note squeezed in my fist, and every so often I would jump on the heels of my feet to keep myself warm. \n\nI was seriously regretting choosing cash over potentially losing my job. Kaian Saeueng was probably the smartest in our graduating class, and already lined up for a top researcher job at an exclusive university, but he was still a trust fund kid—and I was going to take full advantage of that. There was a line though, and standing outside to keep lookout for lingering professor’s and night guards while he and his friends snooped our Professor’s office, was definitely crossing it. Kaian told me they would be ten minutes, and I had been standing there for way over half an hour, scrunching the twenty he gave me tighter and tighter in my fist. When my phone vibrated with a text from my  housemate, I ignored it. \n\nIt’s not like I was against breaking in (I was curious to know what exactly our professor had been working on) but did they have to do this shit at night? Minutes passed. Five minutes. Then ten. I was straightening up with intention to just leave them and head home, when a shadow loomed behind me, and a shriek built in my throat. When my flashlight beam revealed a familiar face, however, I resisted the urge to shove him. \n\nIlluminated in blinding light which hurting my eyes, Kaian Saeueng held up a hand to sign, “Five minutes.” His lips quirked into a scowl, and I would have gotten pissed at him if I weren’t transfixed by the way the light seemed to set every strand of his hair on fire. “What is it?” He signed, looking over my shoulder, his eyes widening. “Shit. Did you see anyone?”\n\nI shook my head. “No. But I want another twenty.”\n\nHe cocked his head. “Relax.”\n\n“Another twenty, or I’m going. I’m not your look-out for free, y’know.”\n\nKaian hesitated, before pressing another twenty in my hand before signing, “You’re the worst.”\n\n“It’s a hustle, baby!”\n\nNodding slowly, the guy gave me an odd look, and I remembered why he didn’t like me. I definitely wasn’t subtle with my flirting.\n\nJust stay here.\n\nThat’s what Kaian said.\n\nFive minutes.\n\nAfter another twenty, I was fidgeting, jumping up and down, every sound causing my head to snap around.\n\nThat was it.\n\n“Hey! What’s taking you so long?”\n\nDucking into Quincy’s office, I found myself in what felt like a modern re-enactment of Scooby Doo. My classmates surrounding my professor’s laptop, each of them brandishing their own flashlight. Jem Littlewood in the centre, his gaze glued to the laptop screen, with Kaian over his shoulder, Riss Claremont busy turning the office upside down, searching through books and files, making a significant mess, and two other’s I couldn’t fully name. \n\nThey had joined our class late into the semester and barely graduated, though I was sure one of them was called Tom. When I was stringing sentences together in my head, trying to figure out how to ask what the hell they were doing, when Jem made hissed out, stabbing the screen. \n\n“Here it is!” He lifted his gaze and met eyes with me. Jem’s eyes were dark. He wasn’t smiling. He looked kind of sick. “I knew it.” Jem poked at the screen again, stabbing at it until Riss hissed at him. “I fucking knew this guy was shady.”\n\nIntrigued, I stepped closer. “What did you find?”\n\nKaian’s eyes left the screen momentarily to glare at me, and I fingered the twenty in my pocket.\n\nSo much for the takeout I’d been planning.\n\n“Human experimentation.” Riss said, leaning on the desk. In her hand was a leather bound file. “It's all in here.” \n\n“Not just humans,” Jem curled his lip in disgust. “He’s been mercilessly murdering rabbits. These little guys can’t even fucking defend themselves, and look at this,” He turned the screen to show me, and I glimpsed a printed image of what was left of a rabbit lying in chunks on the ground. I had to swallow my dinner which had snaked its way back up my throat in a sour paste. Luckily, Riss was quick to explain. She waved the folder in the air. \n\n“A glimpse into the ability to awaken the mind to the extraordinary,” she started to read. “Can we, as humans, push ourselves to lengths greater than man has achieved?” \n\nRiss had always been the level-headed one in the group, but even Riss was struggling to comprehend what she was reading. “It’s talking about taking apart the human brain and stitching it back together with some kind of theoretical serum,” she explained. “Quincy outlines that he’s working on said-serum, but the subjects keep rejecting his advances. They're failing, and he doesn't know why.\" She laughed, \"He's basing research on fiction, essentially. This serum isn't possible outside of Marvel movies because…\" Riss was flipping through pages, her expression growing wilder and wilder. \"Psychokinesis, teleportation… “\n\n“Superpowers.” Jem, who was sitting in the spinning chair, did a dramatic twirl.\n\n“This asshole is trying to find superpowers in rabbits.” He paused, his wandering eyes going back to the light of the MacBook screen. “Through some pretty fucked up shit. This is torture. Look at this, he's hurting them! And these little guys can't fight back! He's injecting that serum, or whatever it is, into them--and trying to find something that doesn't exist.\" His eyes found mine, and for the first time I was terrified of my professor. \"He's a psycho.\" Jem spat, nodding at the screen. \"This is all we need to show the police, and surely they’ll shut him down.”\n\n“Here he goes.” Tom’s voice sounded, but I couldn’t see him. Like my memory was trying to hide him. All I sensed was a shadow looming in the corner. “The fucking animal whisperer. Professor Psycho is cutting into people’s brains, and Dr Doolittle here wants to save the rabbits.”\n\nJem’s cheeks blazed, his head snapping up. “What, and they don’t deserve rights?”\n\nTom chuckled. “You know, I’ve heard rabbit stew is tasty, man. You should try it.”\n\n“You’re hilarious. Why are you even here, Tom?”\n\n“Duh. Professor Freakshow is doing weird shit, and I want in on it. Just like you.” Tom cleared his throat. “Or are you just here to save your furry friends?”\n\nWhen Jem jumped up from the chair, always a loose cannon, Riss shoved him back down.\n\n“Cool it.” Kaian signed. “Tom, stop being an asshole.” He nodded to Riss, who held up pieces of paper with scary red ink printed all over them.  “And look at this. None of this is on campus. This guy’s got a secret lab somewhere, and from the look of it, they have all failed. Look.” She held up another leather folder. “This guy’s pissed off a lot of people. He’s in debt with pretty much everyone in the medical field.”\n\nKaian nodded, leaning over Jem, his eyes stuck to the screen. “Wait.” He signed, drawing our attention back to the laptop. “What’s that?”\n\n“What’s what?” Jem’s expression crumpled with confusion, and Riss followed Kaian’s gaze, her eyes widening. “There.” She pointed. “Go back onto the desktop—no, not that one!” She nudged him. “Do you know how to use a MacBook?” Riss groaned. “Yes. Under that folder.”\n\nAt this point, I was edging closer to them, unable to resist my own curiosity. There was a moment of silence, the three of them intensely frowning at the screen, and Jem moving the mouse at record speed in twitchy movements, before Riss let out an audible cry, her hands slapping over her mouth. “Turn it off!” She shrieked. And Jem, who looked startled himself, leaned back in the chair with panicked eyes.\n\nHis gaze snapped to the door. “Wren, can you watch the hallway?”\n\nSomething ice-cold slithered down my spine, and I nodded, all of the breaths sucked from my lungs. “Yeah.” I said, but I wasn’t heading towards the door. My body had a mind of its own, getting closer and closer to the desk, where Jem was almost comically stabbing buttons and fighting with the mouse to exit whatever he’d managed to open. I thought it was an alarm—but looking at Kaian’s eyes, who was staring at the screen—it was something they were watching. \n\nJem, looking sick to his stomach, and Riss peeking between her hands. Instead of stepping out of the office to be the look-out, I found myself leaning over the desk.. Jem had given up trying to turn it off, instead frowning at it like he was in a trance. And I didn’t blame him.  I started forwards, the screen in front of me coming into view. What I could see were four people in lab coats—- with our faces. \n\nWe surrounded a bed, where a woman was kicking and screaming. I recognised myself, as I held her down, administering something inside an IV which calmed her down, before her body went still, her arms going limp. I stepped forward, and made an incision in her stomach, the four of us carefully opening her up and removing each of her organs, placing them in a white container. It wasn’t the procedure itself which turned my gut. It was that we emptied her out completely with no expression, no glint of humanity in our eyes. I was transfixed by myself, the way I moved, like I was a puppet on strings, when Jem clicked off the video finally, leaving us in an awkward silence. \n\nIt was the perfect time to run, to get out of there. Though part of me wanted to know the origin of the video, and just how exactly my professor had managed to film something I didn’t remember. Jem’s finger tapped at the mouse, and I could sense him starting to freak out. “That’s not us, right?” He looked at me for confirmation like I would know, and I saw the panic starting to twitch in his lips. “What is this, blackmail?” Jem leaned on his fist, and next to him, Riss peeled her hands from her face, letting  out a breath.\n\nKaian, who had been quietly observing, nodded. “It’s blackmail.” He signed, “My guess is he wants us for something.”\n\nHe leaned against a bookcase. “The question is… what?”\n\n“I told you, that’s not me.” Jem gritted out, straightening in the chair. “That’s… that’s a deepfake.”\n\n“No, that’s us.” Riss spoke up, signing simultaneously. “Sorry to burst your bubble, but it’s not possible to create a deep-fake as accurate as that. He would need some serious technology, and Professor Quincy doesn’t exactly strike me as a techie guy,” she held up the documents she’d been clinging onto. “Remember the class we had a few years ago about the theoretical idea of suggestion? He was always bringing it into discussion, right? Almost like he was obsessed with it. Well.” Riss slammed the documents down on the desk, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. “What if he wasn’t talking in theory? We all know it’s possible. MKULTRA. Mind control. It’s not out of the whim of possibility that our unhinged professor managed to get his hands on certain tools which could make the power of suggestion no longer a myth—and something more realistic.” \n\nWhen even Kaian frowned at her dismissively, Riss shrugged. “I’m just saying. We just watched a two minute video of the four of us murdering a woman and removing her organs—and apart from the shock value, none of us seem deeply affected. Which means deep down we already know we’ve done it.” Riss prodded at her own temples, and I was suddenly all too aware of how right she was. I was horrified by the video, yes. But part of me was already desensitised. “Looks like our Professor has been messing with our heads.”\n\nKaian started to sign, but she turned to him. “Do you remember what you did Monday night?”\n\nHis frown told me everything I needed to know.\n\n“Exactly.”\n\nTo further her point, Riss turned to each of us. “Any of you? I thought I passed out and lost several hours. But what if that wasn’t the case?”\n\nJem folded his arms. “That’s impossible, and you’re starting to sound like a conspiracy theorist.”\n\n“No. I think, just like Kaian said, he’s made the perfect blackmail video.”\n\nFootsteps outside suddenly sent my body into fight or flight, and Kaian shot me a dirty look. “You were supposed to wait outside!”\n\nBefore I could answer, a shadow loomed in the doorway. But I never saw it. Instead, my mind plunged me into another memory.\n\nA flash, and I saw Sara and Tom wrapped in plastic. My own hands were bloody, streaked red. I threw them into darkness of the failure room and turned to see my professor’s face.  “Very good, Wren.” He said. “Don’t worry. There are successes in failures. Sara and Tom weren’t strong.” His hands were on my shoulders, and the feeling of his grasp on me felt familiar. Warm. “What did I say, Wren? Word for word.”\n\n“That they are not to be considered as human,” I said, my voice a monotone drawl, “Sara and Tom are subjects of the Mildew experiment.”\n\n“Precisely.” He said. His hands squeezed my shoulders. “I see a lot of myself in you, Wren. Conflicting morals and a state of mind begging the question: Are we good people? As scientists, no we are not. Humans? Debatable. You will soon understand the lengths I am going to will benefit humankind. I want you to be on that journey with me. All of you. I believe you will become stepping stones to the new age of man.”\n\n“Yes, Professor Quincy.”\n\nI didn’t remember any of that.\n\nSo, why did I know the feeling of warm blood on my hands and spattered up and down my arms? Why did I know the sensation of my scalpel slicing through a human arm—— human flesh. Sara. Why did I know the exact weight of her in my arms, and where to dispose of her body?\n\nThe trauma of that specific memory being dug up was enough to jolt my brain into awareness, reality blooming. I awoke with foggy thoughts, staring real hard at a white ceiling. I couldn’t move. My body was stiff. It didn’t feel like mine, like I was a phantom barely clinging on. Through half lidded eyes I just managed to force open, I glimpsed clinical white. \n\nThere was just… white—a large expanse of white, and enveloping the white was a figure looming over me speaking in tongues, and I had to really concentrate to figure out what they were saying. It took me a white to figure out it was the radio. It was a newscaster, their voice crackling into my ears just as a thunderbolt of pain racked the back of my skull. “Good afternoon. It is April 3rd 2020. The WHO have announced today new curbs to combat the novel…  as cases rise across the—”\n\nApril 3rd?\n\nWeeks had gone by—- and I had spent them detached from reality. A prisoner of my own mind.\n\n“In other news, it’s been rumored that washing your hands three times to the tune of Happy Birthday is enough to…”\n\nThe voice on the radio cut off, and I swallowed a shriek building in my non-existent throat.\n\nHappy birthday, I thought.\n\nDid it calm people?\n\nCould I… use it as an anchor?\n\n“That’s enough of that.” Professor Quincy’s voice was like a wave of ice cold water, startling me. “I apologise if the radio is distracting, folks. I’m just prepping Subject A. Just give me a moment, and I’ll be with you. If you’re curious about this virtual procedure, please go to the about page on my website.” I could feel the tips of his fingers stroking my scalp, a protruding needle sticking into the back of my skull, warm wetness dripping down my back.\n\nStop. I just wanted it all to stop. I wanted to fall. Plunge. I wanted to go home. I was reminded of a memory of myself struggling with a rabbit, trying to drill into its head. Karma. My body relaxed when the professor’s fingers slipped inside my skull. \n\nI didn’t have a mouth to scream with. I was awake, I thought. I shouldn’t have been awake mid procedure. I must have made some kind of inclination, my body rattling from the agony wracking my head, before Professor Quincy’s voice slipped effortlessly into my ears, and I felt hatred. His touch leaves me for a moment. \n\n“I apologise, Wren.” Professor Quincy’s voice slipped into my ears, and I felt.. hatred. I felt like my body was burning. I was screaming into an abyss which held me down.  “I don’t think I administered enough anaesthetic. Please forgive me.” His hands still sticky with my blood stroked through the bald patch in my hair, and the deep, carnivorous hole inside my brain.\n\nI was aware of him speaking my colleague’s name several times, but I couldn’t question him. There was something being forced down my throat.\n\nJem, I thought dizzily.\n\nWhat were they doing to him?\n\n“Go to sleep,” My professor cooed, returning to my side. “Good girl.”\n\nI did, fireworks coming to life in the backs of my eyes when oblivion bled into consciousness, and I was left to hang suspended in the dark.\n\nThat was when I first saw it.\n\nIt started like… a tiny pinprick of light.\n\nBut as time passed, it grew bigger, something I could comprehend. Intense pulsing energy I felt like I could reach and envelop my hands in, sizzling, crackling, and exploding while my body burned, pieces of me coming apart, memories I had held onto drifting away, and a sense of losing myself. My name. Everything I had been. \n\nAnd that light, that blinding blue light I didn’t think possible, grew brighter.\n\nUntil it swallowed me up.",

        "text": "It was approaching midnight when the cab dropped Dave off at the house. He had arrived at the San Antonio Airport in Texas a few hours earlier and spoken with Carlos, his host, while the plane was still on the runway.\n\n“It’s the one with gardenias outside and the silver scooter parked in the driveway,” Carlos told him about the house, adding that he’d be inside watching TV. “I’m addicted to this show about real estate,” he said. “Sometimes I stay up all night and watch eight or nine episodes in a row!”\n\nBut as Dave approached the house on foot, none of the lights seemed to be on. The street was dark, as if the police had imposed a strict curfew. A black pit bull in the yard next door eyed him suspiciously as he walked to the front door.\n\nDave rang the bell. No answer.\n\nHe rang again, this time waiting a full thirty seconds.\n\nNothing.\n\n“Carlos?” he called, his voice echoing in the empty alley beside the house.\n\nDave walked around the house, making fruitless attempts to enter through the doors and windows. He pulled out his iPhone and double-checked the address.\n\nCarlos had spelled it out for him in a text message and an email: “154 South Pine Drive, San Antonio, TX.” He could smell the gardenias planted by the side of the entryway. In the driveway, the silver scooter glinted in the orange glow of the streetlight.\n\nThis was the place, all right. But where was his high school friend, whom he’d traveled all the way from Maine to visit for a spring break?\n\nHe called Carlos and left a message on his voicemail.\n\n“Hey dude,” Dave said. “It’s me. Uh, I’m outside your house right now and can’t figure out where you are. I thought you’d be up watching TV. Hoping you didn’t forget about me!”\n\nAs Dave spoke, a police car drifted by, slowing noticeably as it passed. It was too dark to see through the windows, but it appeared as if the cop was watching him.\n\nDave was officially perplexed. Carlos had always been an extremely responsible guy, much more so than Dave, whose friends often referred to him as a “space cadet.” In high school, when the two of them played on a travel soccer team together, Carlos always brought an extra pair of socks and shin guards, in the likely event that Dave would leave one or the other—or both—behind.\n\nWhereas Dave dressed sloppily, as if he’d just rolled out of bed, Carlos always dressed in crisply ironed button-downs and jeans. As a teenager, he was always reading thick novels and talking about the characters as if they were people he knew in real life. “The thing about Raskolnikov is that he’s inherently a good man,” Dave remembered his friend saying of one of those characters, though of course he had no idea what he was talking about.\n\nCarlos, in other words, was not the absent-minded type, let alone the kind of guy who forgets his best friend is about to arrive at his house. And yet, by all appearances, this was what had happened.\n\n“He must have zipped out for a soda at the Mobil station or something,” Dave thought, giving his pal the benefit of the doubt. True, it was odd to have done such a thing at midnight, he reasoned. But sometimes you just need a Slim Jim and a Mountain Dew. Dave understood the urge.\n\nHe sat down atop his suitcase and waited.\n\nFifteen minutes went by. Then thirty. Then forty-five.\n\nThe pit bull in the yard next door did not stop staring at him the entire time. But while it had irked him at first, Dave found himself amazed at the dog’s capacity to concentrate. At a time when Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram were overtaking human beings’ attention spans, he thought, dogs had not lost their ability to focus. Or not this dog, at least.\n\nAnother fifteen minutes passed. Dave was seriously considering falling asleep on the doorstep when he saw a woman approach on the sidewalk. She appeared to be in her late twenties, and she wore a bathrobe and a pair of fuzzy pink slippers. Noticing Dave half-asleep on the steps, she walked towards him.\n\nStartled, Dave bolted upright. “This night is about to get even weirder,” he thought.\n\n“How are you?” the woman called in a thick Texas accent as she made her way across the wet grass.\n\n“Fine, just waiting for my friend here,” Dave said. By now he could see that she was wearing a nightgown beneath her robe.\n\n“Carlos, right?” she said, stopping ten feet in front of him. She fixed him with a neighborly smile, which seemed out of place on this dark and desolate block.\n\n“That’s right,” he said.\n\n“How do you know him?”\n\n“Oh, he’s an old friend,” Dave said. “Or at least I thought he was.” He let out an exhausted laugh. “I just flew in from Maine. He was supposed to meet me here about two hours ago, but I can’t seem to figure out where he is. And the house is locked up tight.”\n\n“Well, Carlos has been acting a bit strange lately,” the woman said. “In fact, over the last few months, this whole neighborhood had been acting weird.”\n\nDave shifted uncomfortably on his suitcase.\n\n“What do you mean, the whole neighborhood?” he asked.\n\n“Well,” the woman said, casting a sidelong glance at the extra attentive pit bull next door. “There seems to be something going around. A kind of sickness. A night sickness, I guess you’d call it.”\n\n“Night sickness?” Dave said.\n\n“Mmmhmm,” the woman said, raising her eyebrow. “I’m Patricia, by the way.”\n\nThe two of them shook hands.\n\nAs Dave listened raptly, Patricia explained the recent spate of strange events. A few months before, she’d noticed one of her neighbors, a kindly retired dentist named Hans, walk past her bedroom window at 3 o’clock in the morning. Patricia was rightly spooked. She leapt out of bed and ran outside to see what was going on.\n\nShe found Hans removing Coke cans from her recycling bin. Hearing her approach, he turned to look at her with a blank stare.\n\n“He was clearly sleepwalking,” Patricia explained. She added that her father was a sleepwalker, so she recognized the symptoms. To wake him from his slumber, she drew near him and clapped loudly several times. Poor Hans suddenly came to his senses and gazed at her with a bewildered look. Patricia gently led him back to his house.\n\nIn the ensuing weeks, however, Patricia began to notice more neighbors walking slowly down the sidewalk in the middle of the night. “It started to look like that video for Michael Jackson’s song ‘Thriller,’” she said with a laugh. “Like a bunch of zombies walking down the street.”\n\nNo one knew what to make of it. The police were fielding dozens of calls per night. The reports were wildly varied but consistent in that they all occurred at night: “A strange man is pretending to hit golf balls in my backyard!” “There’s a woman in hair curlers pruning my hedges in the front yard!”\n\nA local physician had determined that all of the intruders in question had been sleepwalking. But try as he might, he could not figure out the cause. “Mass sleepwalking,” he told the local newspaper, “is not a diagnosable condition.”\n\nTo prevent injury, the city police had issued a strict curfew of 11 o’clock. They also instructed all residents to bar their doors at night to prevent themselves—and others—from opening them in a sleepwalking state.\n\n“Pretty weird, right?” Patricia said.\n\nDave took a moment to form a response.\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” he finally managed. “I mean, that’s really crazy. I’ve never heard of anything like that!” After a pause, he continued, “So do you think Carlos—I mean, do you think he’s one of the … afflicted?”\n\n“You know,” Patricia said, “I wouldn’t doubt it for a second. In fact, I was just coming over to check on him.”\n\nJust then, the two of them wheeled around at the sound of a car skidding into the driveway. Dave recognized the beaten-up black 1996 Jeep Cherokee.\n\nCarlos sprang out of the driver’s side door.\n\n“Dave!” he shouted. “Dude! I’m so sorry!” He ran across the grass to greet the two of them. “I got a flat tire on my way to the 7/11, and I had to hitch a ride to the nearest gas station. Took forever! My phone died just when I was leaving the house.”\n\nCarlos clapped Dave on the shoulder. Dave uttered an unintelligible sound.\n\n“I see you’ve met Patricia,” Carlos said, kissing her on the cheek. “She’s the girl I’ve been telling you about. We’re totally in love.”\n\nAs Patricia rolled her eyes, Dave stared at her, trying to discern whether she’d been lying.\n\n“So … that stuff about the sleepwalking. Was that … true?”\n\n“Oh yeah,” Carlos said, shaking his head. “Whole city seems to be coming down with it.” He paused. “You’re not scared of the dark, are you?”",

        "text": "Memories are fascinating tools of human ingenuity; Many carry the weight of childhood nostalgia and a ghostly reassurance in the symbolism of our lives. Others are obstacles.\n\nThe story of Mr.Eckhart is one of those obstacles. \n\nIt starts with a transition, from a time of stagnant chill to one of celebration, from winter’s claw to spring’s hammer. I suppose others may have similar tales about the monumental figures of their childhood, people that were just a passing but vital messenger. It’s funny how we often get fuzzy on the good things but remember every single camera pan of the bad ones.   \n\nI can see its golden hew in the deepening evening sky. I remember that spring just as I am now turning thirty, and I’m just as scared now as I was then, if I’m being honest. How do I begin to tell you about the yellow snow, or the evil intent of a man?\n\nWhen it first began, I was ten or eleven -I don’t recall my exact age. It began the last days of March, when spring’s warm grasp turned the midday sky into an opaque golden, worshiping the treetops and churning the charismatic life smoke from stalk to stalk. I was too young to recall many specific details of that spring in ‘02 or ‘03. Mr. Eckhart lived in a faraway realm from my mind. I was swinging on vines in the woods behind my house with my friends and building lackluster forts with rotten two-by-fours. On the back porch on Saturday afternoons, I listened to dad’s high raspy voice and his acoustic guitar forming the enamel of some songs that would eventually take his band to a new level. \n\nThe bane of Mr.Eckhart’s existence was his loneliness. Anyone who ever knew a single thing about the man knew that. He lived a solitary life up on a hill outside of Fairview, half a mile from the town dump. He was the “strange old man”, the mantra townsfolk assigned to him like a scarlet letter. Back then, people treated him like a copperhead, but from what I had heard, he never bit. All he did was carry its sign. \n\nI was okay with the lonely Mr. Eckhart. He never disturbed my magical world of nerf guns and flag football. So what was the problem, mom? Dad? And without pause or reservation -before mom could squeeze dad’s lips shut with her eyes- he’d say: “Fucking Jerry.” \n\nFrom the stories I overheard, when my parents thought I was not around, the first days of spring were always generous to Mr.Eckhart. Its lustrous yellow spread covered his property at a depth of one inch in some places. I'll admit that the idea of this swirling Crayola yellow nightmare frightened me. But, if ever I ventured near his property and witnessed this, the years have done well to repress such memories. The mind, as such, is a powerhouse for self-preservation; Sometimes the bad things stick like congealed pollen in a rain gutter. \n\nIn ‘09, when I was finishing up my junior year of high school, I met the man for the first time.  \n\nOn a day in March, I stopped on the left shoulder of River Valley Road, peering over my handlebars at the mangled mess of a cat on the blacktop. We didn’t own a cat back then, but we had a chocolate lab puppy. I remember imagining Rocco in the dead cat’s place, seized up and stiff. The horrible intensity of it is a memory I recall well, the cat’s intestines splayed amid the fresh yellow powder of spring. It was reduced to a grotesque road marker. So caught up in my observations, I didn’t notice the figure striding down the long driveway on the other side of the road. \n\n“Hello.” \n\nI swung around. \n\nThe man enjoyed my surprise or was ignorant of it because he kept smiling as he approached the nasty road-kill scene. He appeared to walk fine but punched a gnarled cane into the pavement every three feet. It was Mr.Eckhart in the flesh, his house just up the slight hill. How I could have been so oblivious to my surroundings puzzled me.  \n\n“My cat,” he remarked in a German accent, sounding subdued but not showing it. “Poor thing, I see.”\n\nMr.Eckhart was still dressed for winter: thick blue jeans, heavy-duty boots, brown wool jacket zipped up, camouflage hat pushed down on his crown. He was a shriveled man, the slivers of youth in his motions seemingly withering by the moment. He stopped just short of his mailbox. In addition to those peeling lips, his black sunglasses were smiling high up on his smooth, pale face.\n\nThe man raised the twisted cane and motioned towards the yellowing heap of torn black fur near me. \n\n“Looking all day for him. His name was Aldo. My mess. I’ll go and clean him up.”\n\nHe shook his downcast head, beginning to turn back. \n\nI don’t know if there is some unknowable entity that forces us all along specific paths, but I know I would not be the type of man I am today if I hadn't spoken. \n\n“Have you got a shovel?” He continued to shake his head, but not to my question. \n\n“Wheelbox,” he said, and I knew he meant ‘wheelbarrow.’\n\nI took his mumbled queue and followed, pushing my dusty yellow bike with me. I was unsure about what I thought I was doing, but I knew two things. First, I was bigger than Mr.Eckhart if bees took to honey. Secondly, I felt obligated to ensure the cat had a proper burial since I was the one who had found it.\n\nLate Saturday mornings aren’t meant for the dead, especially those that are clear and full of birdsong, but I shadowed Mr.Eckhart’s retreat up the hill. The driveway meandered around the right side of his two-story home, bordered by the barren stumps and twigs of past living seasons.    \n\n“I hate spring,” Mr.Eckhart commented as he rounded the corner, and I would have, too, if the plants loved me as much as they appeared to love him. Our shoes left perfect prints on the pavement. Pollen absorbed the surrounding yard like a paper-thin blanket. \n\n“Sir?” \n\n“Ya?”\n\n“The stories are true, aren’t they? About this time of year?”\n\nHe grunted, not responding right away. When he did, he just laughed.\n\n“How old are *you*? Still in diapers, yus? Still believing in fairytales, yus?” And he laughed again. His dry crackle made me feel sorry for his advancing age.  \n\nI leaned my bike against the house, and we started across the yellow grass towards the barn. The barn was one hundred yards or so from his back door. He didn’t have a back porch, just a rectangular concrete slab with a single wooden chair and a grill on its yellow surface. \n\nHow that padlock chain dangled from those two wooden doors stirred worry to a liquid in my guts. I hated how that barn just sat there like a dead bug in the sun. Becoming ever so more confident that he didn't need that cane, I saw *every* reason to be dishonest about my age and reason more to be wary. \n\n“I’m eighteen, sir,” I said.  \n\nMr.Eckhart stopped. He seemed to sniff the air, and turned. I saw that his nose was a bulbous appendage of white flesh. He made his point at me with a long wrinkled finger. \n\n“In spring lies the torment, boy.”\n\nHe turned back around, leaving me scratching my head. We resumed our trek. He grabbed the padlock and got the key in without battle when we got to the barn. Inside, blades of light from the sun cut the shadows in sections, and the only remarkable object I saw was a vehicle covered in a worn-out gray tarp. Along the left wall was a workstation piled with a man’s equivalent of happiness: tools. In plain sight near the opposite wall was the wheelbarrow. I moved towards it but stopped. Did I *want* to be in front of Mr.Eckhart? \n\nHe pointed at it. \n\n“You want to help, yus? You roll it.” \n\nI swallowed. \n\n“Okay.” \n\nI got the wheelbarrow back down the hill. Mr.Eckhart handed me the shovel he’d taken and leaned back on his cane as I worked. He surprised me in a different tone. \n\n“Thank you, boy. What’s your name?”\n\nI was as delicate as possible with the cat, but it was -forgive me for the metaphor- like trying to flip a fried egg in a sticky pan. \n\n“Sandy,” I said. \n\n“*Huh?*”\n\n“My name. It’s Sandy.”\n\n“Right,” he said, nodding vigorously. “Sandy, do you know my name?” \n\nI levered the cat off the shovel and into the wheelbarrow, wincing when the hanging viscera slapped the dirty surface. I looked up to find Mr.Eckhart’s black sunglasses smiling at me again. \n\n“Eckhart,” I said and tried to be funny, even grinned a little. “Everyone knows you by your first, middle, and last name: Eckhart.”\n\nAll black sunglasses on me.  \n\n“My first name.”\n\nI pretended to think about it but just shook my head. \n\n“Josef,” he said. “Josef Lucius Eckhart the Third.” He was quiet as I wheeled the cat back up the hill. After rounding the corner, he motioned for me to stop at the garage entrance, which I *assumed* was a garage, intersecting the main house. He went in and started moving things around, twisting things, grunting. After a minute or so, he came back out with thick white gardening gloves, abruptly grabbed the dead cat by its stiff scruff, and hurried back in. \n\n“*Incinerator!*” he said from inside.  \n\nA light wind had kicked up and created a formidable yellow cloud. I wanted to tell Mr.Eckhart that it was okay. I’d bury it, that I’d do it myself. I could have entered the garage to inspect what was going on, but when I stepped forward he shouted:\n\n“Don’t come in! Sights like this shouldn’t be seen by a mere boy.”\n\nShould I just grab my bike and leave? I thought it probably one hundred times when he stepped back out in the sun. I couldn’t see his eyeballs from behind his thick sunglasses, but I knew they had changed their tone as his smile had transitioned into a tight frown. If he was looking past me, I couldn’t tell. Black smoke filtered from the chimney into the blue sky. \n\n“To Hell with it. *My God.”*\n\nI opened my mouth, but nothing came out.\n\n“*Look at all dis shit!”* he shouted, raising his cane and hands to the sky, walking around me in agitation. “*Every guddamn year, I’m made to suffer!”*\n\nGooseflesh prickled on my arms, but I rubbed them out with my hands. His backyard was a thick haze of pollen, moving in one direction: left to right, like a river current. I remembered him asking me if I still believed in fairytales. I wanted to ask *him* why he was so superstitious. I could only marvel at the spectacle despite this -as I would soon find out- being the old man’s annual seasonal inconvenience. \n\n“This is crazy,” I said, dumbfounded by the yellow air. “Why is it so *much*? Where’s it all *coming* from, Mr. Eckhart?”\n\nI didn’t see him reaching into his pocket, but there was a fifty-dollar bill in my hand the next instant. A level tone fell from his curled lips, one full of hatred and wild fear despite the fertilized tears cascading over his cheekbones. \n\n“Want a spring job, boy?” \n\nNow that I think about it, it was the same as asking if I wanted years of swirling, Crayola yellow nightmares.\n\n                                                                              \\*\n\nYou’re probably thinking: Whatever happened to this Sandy kid, it’s his fault for going back to that property. And I wish there was a more eloquent way to explain myself, but there isn’t. He paid me well for a man with a home weathered bare and gray.\n\nThe following Saturday, the first one in April, I arrived at Mr.Eckhart’s house at ten in the morning to haul cut logs across the yard. Earlier that week, he had called a landscaping company to butcher three large oak trees, one in his front yard and two in the back. When I got there that Saturday morning, a mound of yellowing sawdust sat in the middle of the yard where the stump had been eaten away by metal. The tree was chainsawed, and the base pieces rolled into a pile off to the side. Mr.Eckhart was sitting in a chair on the front porch when I pulled up on my bike. The air was cool, but the sun was out, and there was no breeze. \n\nHe watched me pull up, goggles replacing his sunglasses. His shirt was off, and his torso was shrunk to the waist like a funnel. Skin tags riddled his flabby skin. His white chest hair had a dusting of pollen. \n\nIt was strange. The closer I got to his front porch, the more pollen there was. \n\n“Good morning, Mr.Eckhart,” I said, dumping my bike near the steps. \n\nMr.Eckhart nodded once, reached shakily to his right, and picked up a pair of gardening gloves and goggles from a small table. He handed them to me. There were two cans of beer on the table, as well.\n\n“What I need you to do is drag that mess, see..” he motioned towards the cut-up tree in the front yard with his chin. “..drag that bitch to the back and burn it.” \n\nI said yessir, and just as I turned around, I heard him say: \n\n“One hundred dollars for every mudder-*fuck* of a tree you get rid of.” \n\nI worked until two or three that afternoon, dragging branches and logs to the burn pit Mr.Eckhart made earlier that morning. I made three hundred dollars that day. Dad was off on tour with his band around then, and the guitars he often left behind I played in lust. I suppose he made enough to snag any guitar in any guitar store I wanted, but I wanted to earn my first one.\n\nI was rushing when it hit mid-afternoon. There was a girl I was taking to the movies that night, and I needed to wash some clothes for that evening. She was the epitome of first dates, but I don’t remember her name; many came and went over those years.\n\nAs I worked, I often caught Mr.Eckhart waving a lighter in the air like he was trying to catch the sway of a ballad at a rock concert. He would angrily kick at the yellow dust with his bare feet and mutter curses. Towards the end of the day, he walked up to me in the backyard as I threw the remnants of twigs and branches into the steady flame. He still only wore his shorts and goggles, and he was delirious in the day's warmth. \n\nHe had a wad of bills in one hand, the lighter in another. \n\n“Bullshit *fuck*! I hate this! I hate…” he paused, gazing up at my face. The goggles made me want to laugh at him. “You know, boy, sometimes I live to see the night. Give me the night! Here you go, my *sweet* Sandy boy!” \n\nBefore I could move, he tucked the bills into my pocket, jumped back, threw his face up to the sky, and laughed, a terrible grin breaking the skin along his lips. I pretended to understand the situation, but this frightened me. \n\nI liked how the wad of twenties felt in my pocket though. \n\n\\*\n\nFor the next few weeks, the pollen count over the county dropped, as it naturally does. But it got worse on Mr.Eckhart’s property. I know this because Mr.Eckhart had me take his beaten-up Toyota pick-up to a Home Depot to get twenty gallons of liquid grass killer and a bed-load of orbit sprinklers for the yard. He had alcohol on his breath as he shakily hashed out the money I was to use for the supplies. His words, “I’m done fucking around.”   \n\nI’m not proud of my swift, joyful attitude towards the decimation of Mr.Eckhart’s yard. If he wanted me to kill every blade of grass, I was prepared to do it. I think I tried; There was plenty of green growth in the world, but Mr.Eckhart wanted his dead.   \n\nI set all the sprinklers up in his yard in a circular pattern, all relatively close to the house. For these jobs, I wore boots and jeans despite the gaining humidity and a mask in addition to the goggles. The stubborn yellow ejaculate was several inches deep along the foundation, obscuring my heels. On Mr.Eckhart’s roof, it was a thick unearthly blanket. \n\nWhile the sprinklers spurted the poison, I was either disposing of the limbs of other trees Mr.Eckhart had his landscaping cut down, or doing my best to wash away the yellow madness on the exterior walls of his house, the cement walkways, the porch, or the driveway. One day I even got on a ladder and attempted to rid the roof shingles and second-story windows of Mr.Eckhart’s hell. After that, I spent a week straight after school and all day during the weekend digging a shallow trench from the house to the barn, then followed that to a steep embankment at the tree-line. I noticed aberrant indentations in the earth where Mr.Eckhart had most likely resumed digging when I was gone. I layered that same trench with over a thousand pounds of concrete I mixed in the wheelbarrow I had used as the cat’s hearse earlier that spring. This task alone cost me precious hours normally spent practicing guitar scales but made me one thousand dollars richer.    \n\nBut here’s the thing. It always came back. After an arduous day’s worth of work, the pollen would be back the next morning, and I would have to labor it away with the hose or the shovel. Mostly the shovel as time went on. \n\nThe ground would be saturated with an inhumane concentration of RoundUp from the previous day. But yet, the yellow drifted in the wind like food coloring in water, a solid sheen of unforgiveness. By the last week in April, I knew what I had been seeing was for me somehow. I knew the spring had eyes for Mr.Eckhart, and it was making me watch.\n\nOn a late April afternoon, I had all sprinklers on, soaking the torched soil. Nothing grew, but the pollen was an everlasting tide seeping forward. The porch steps were steeped in half a foot of it. Mr.Eckhart no longer sat outside. Understandably. \n\nAs I was spraying the trench banks, mesmerized by the turbulent flow of dirty yellow water, I saw him stumble out of the barn bare naked. He hauled a gas canister in both hands. I felt the bright tremors of alarm in my head and strolled over to him quickly. His mouth was moving, and he was crying, saying he wished he had done things differently, praying to God that what he had done would just kill him already. When I reached out to grab the canister, I saw it and shrunk away immediately. Directly above the base of his shriveled penis was the tattoo of a swastika, faded and gray with time but distinct. I looked into his face and tried to see his eyes through the fog of his goggles. I had torn mine off in the run-over.  \n\n“Mr.Eckhart,” I said. He was speaking in German now, staring past me at the house. I didn’t know if the RoundUp was flammable by itself or its reaction with gasoline. That’s why I had moved the burn pit further back away from his residence in the first place. And Mr.Eckhart was moving *away* from the pit, directly towards his back door. \n\n“Josef,” I tried again, looking back at the tattoo and wishing I hadn’t. He was getting erect. I took a hurried breath and jostled the object from his horribly-callused hands. It wasn’t hard, and he didn’t seem to care. The foreign words he sputtered sounded to me like attempts to dislodge dirt. \n\nI couldn’t help my panic. \n\n“Dude, what the hell? You’ll burn everything down!” \n\nI convinced myself. I would call emergency services. Even in my disgust at Mr.Eckhart’s physical demeanor, I felt a transient obligation to care for him. \n\nMr.Eckhart grabbed a tuft of my soaked shirt. I cried out in surprise, wrapping my hand around his wrist. His deep tone overlooked the grimace on his face. \n\n“Down...stairs,” he said. “Downstairs.”\n\n“Downstairs...” I said, relieved I could hear his normal voice again. “Mr.Eckhart, *why* are you naked?” \n\nHe let me go and retreated to the barn, shutting the door behind him. I decided to go home to wash this interchange off of me. I was afraid Mr.Eckhart would resume his questionable pursuit of arson, so I took the gas canister with me. As it turned out, he didn’t have to wait long for the paralyzed sleep. It came for him the next day. \n\n\\*\n\nThe following morning I went back to inform Mr.Eckhart that I had done everything in my power to alleviate his stresses but that it seemed like an unexplainable malevolence had shadowed his property. The truth -something I wouldn’t tell him- was that he had made me uncomfortable. \n\nI didn’t understand the whole thing, but I no longer wanted to be caught in the middle of a battle between man and nature. I would thank him for paying me so well, of course. I still had my manners. \n\nDespite my sore body, I pedaled that Sunday morning and made the right turn off River Valley Road and up the dusty yellow driveway. When I got to the top, I pedaled in deep pollen the consistency of fine-powdered snow. When I saw what was on the front porch, I stopped and sat there for however long it took me to find the strength to move again. \n\nSomething shifted in the trees nearby, and a thin but disruptive yellow veil cut through the air; It was conclusory, and I wanted to scream at the deep blue sky. Mr.Eckhart’s hell had thickened the air, riding a subtle current, and turned my vision and body into a chalky pastel yellow. I engaged the kick-stand and hopped off.\n\nAs I came up the steps, which weren’t steps at all now, just a yellow slope, I greeted Mr.Eckhart, knowing he didn’t have that capability anymore. The madness had ended him. \n\nHe was in the chair. The madness had ended him through multiple orifices, it appeared. His eyes had been diseased by the terror, stiff and bulging through puffy yellow sockets. It had clogged his nostrils, which were swollen. It had taken advantage of his screams, his mouth open wide, wider than any mouth should have been allowed to open, and the terror had run in, had no doubt ceased his breathing. I moved up the steps cautiously, searching for each step. Mr.Eckhart looked like a slug, his neck large and twisted, gut protruding from his stained shirt. There was no blood. Then, I saw the dark trails underneath his clouded eyes. I understood what really killed Mr.Eckhart.\n\nThe madness had brought him to a whimpering boy of himself. \n\nI would not be writing this if his front door hadn’t been open. I think the nightmare would have been more manageable had that entrance been unwelcoming. Pinned to the door with a nail was an envelope with **Sandy** scratched in black marker. \n\nI shuffled forward, inadvertently kicking pollen everywhere, cursing, shaking. “Jesus Christ,” I said, touching the envelope but withdrawing quickly. Wasn’t this a crime scene? \n\nBut the interior of Mr.Eckhart’s everything was inches away, and I *had* to see. Something told me he had shut this door before sitting in the chair, maybe even going so far as to lock it. Who had opened this door? Could they still be inside? \n\nI stepped into a living area that had the aroma of old age. Two couches, gray and used, formed a right angle with the wall. I could hear an air vent’s rattle, but I could feel no current.\n\nFearful the door would shut as soon as I made my way deeper inside, I pushed the door all the way to the wall and propped one of the couches against it. \n\nIt was dark, the curtains impenetrable, but the light from the front door engulfed the place and turned it into an unsettling gray hue. \n\nHad I been confident Mr.Eckhart was really dead? I decided to look back at the sitting bloated version of him, the lower half of his calves hidden beneath the yellow tide. Did I expect him to suddenly rise? At one point, I think I did. \n\nIt crossed my mind that I was almost done with high school, a year left to go, and wouldn’t it have been funny to have been murdered by a dead man? What would my parents think, what would they *believe*? \n\nOn the right, next to the living room, was a dining room. Boxes with some of their spilled contents littered the table. I found a wooden slide door and entered the dead man’s kitchen. \n\nI expected to see something unsavory there, but the kitchen was tidy and clean. The marble counters reflected light from the window above the sink. I moved on through the door. I could go directly to my right into a brief corridor-like space that ended with the backdoor, straight ahead towards what looked like a lounge or go up some stairs that went up to my right further down. Squinting, I could see the lounge-like room twenty feet or so away, and my blood ran cold. \n\nI stood at the entrance to Mr.Eckhart’s cozy memorabilia room. For awhile I was confused, biting my lip, turning it around in my head. Could Mr.Eckhart have been in the war? The lamps in this one space were on, and I could clearly see what was on the walls. \n\nNazi flags plastered the walls, the ones with the sharp-edged swastikas on red backdrops. Old black-and-white photographs were blown up in huge, decorative frames on all sides. A fireplace sat like an eternity to my left, its brick foundation slightly blackened and soiled. It wasn’t until later on, during a college history course, that I fully understood the symbolism of the death-head, the skull with the cross and bones. At seventeen years old, I didn’t recognize the Angel of Death, Josef Mengele, in the four by four frame in front of me. I didn’t know who the wiry man next to the Angel of Death was, either. For all I knew, they were two guys having a comical conversation, guys who wore really cool uniforms and talked of women and dreams. At seventeen years old, I didn’t know who that man was who posed in front of a tough battalion of men. The Beast of Belsen, Josef Kramer, names and infamous murderers I had never heard of before. They all surrounded my ignorant statue. \n\nBy the far right wall, tucked in the corner, was a surly oak desk, its surface polished and unperturbed by the masses of stationary stacked on the red velvet rug near it. I meandered around a long, low-lying table decimated by thick books with yellowing pages, and pulled the heavy wooden chair away from the monstrous desk. I think I thought about running my fingers over the surface, just to prove to myself I wasn’t scared of this place. But then I thought about the dead man outside and temporarily backed away. \n\nA thick white binder was sitting on one of the wooden desk’s shelves. I sat down in the chair, hesitated, reached and grabbed it, and frowned as the front cover wobbled in my fingers; the seam had ripped three quarters of the way down. The thing was old. It was a memory photo book. \n\nOn the inside of the cover was a date I assumed described the inception of what I was about to see: \n\n*July 14th, 1941*\n\nThe next few pages showed a baby cradled in a crib. Under each one:\n\n*Josef Lucius Eckhart III*\n\nMost of the text that I would see would be written in scribbled German, but it didn’t matter that I couldn’t read the damned words; what matters is what I *saw.* \n\nI turned the page over. Here was Mr.Eckhart as a toddler, shrouded in a big white diaper, crawling on the floor. Here was Mr.Eckhart with a bubbly grin on his baby lips. Here was what I assumed was his father, holding his son out to the unknown photographer. \n\nA few photographs were so distilled with age and wear that I could only make out a knee here or a tree there. Soon, I got to the other guys. In one, I remember seeing what I now know to be an SS officer cradling his own baby, an MG-42 machine gun. He was blowing smoke towards the photographer. And laughing. I shivered. \n\nThree men huddled together. Mr.Eckhart’s father among them, cigarette in mouth, oblivious of the camera. \n\nTowards the end of 1942, I came across some intriguing photos. I don’t remember much of what I saw, but I *do* recall seeing a group of children standing at attention to the photographer. They had all been frowning, backs straight, palms planted flat to their sides. The next few photos were of them doing some kind of training exercises, running around and around in a large open field. \n\nMay 1943. A very young Josef Lucius Eckhart III standing up, clothed in nothing but underwear, a toy duck fisted in one hand. \n\nJuly 1943. A large structure with a railway passage cutting through it. The next one, a train billowing smoke and approaching the entrance, but from a different angle. This place looked familiar to me like I had seen it in an English textbook or something. \n\nI flipped the pages in a fever, growing uneasy.\n\n1944. Things started getting bad, *really* fucking bad. In one photo, hundreds of people stood around the boxcars, faces wild and confused, some suspicious. Nazi officials loomed over them. In one, a joyful SS soldier was smirking while leading a horde of terrified faces down a dirt path barricaded with barbed wire. \n\n1944, still. *Gaskammern von Auschwitz,* read the description. I knew the word ‘Auschwitz’, and I remembered the word ‘gaskammern’ because it had the word ‘gas’ in it. I tried to swallow, but my throat was dry. A German Shepard lunged for a young girl grasping her mother’s skirt. In the next photo, a Nazi was forcibly yanking on the same dog’s leash while it tore at the same girl’s lifeless body. \n\nI flipped more feverishly, more frantically, unable to turn away, held in by its spell.\n\nBy October of 1944, all of the photos were of mangled corpses being ripped open by men in white lab coats. In more than a few, the mutilated bodies were being burned in a large bonfire. In two or three, a man appearing to loom over a body turned to face the camera and smiled. There was a gap between his upper middle incisors. The description read: *Doktor Mengele.* Dr.Mengele playfully showed off his scalpel in the next one. \n\nNovember 1944. Bodies. Charred remains. \n\nDecember 1944. Men in white coats. Bodies. Bulging dead eyes. \n\nJanuary 1945. Bodies. Bodies. Bodies- \n\nI groaned and threw the memory book aside. *I should burn it,* I thought, thinking about my fingerprints. Oh, Jesus Christ, Mr.Eckhart’s father had been a murderer, a damned sadist. They *all*\\- \n\nSomething shattered to the floor near the kitchen. I drew back from the chair, knocking it to the carpet in my haste, and scrambled into the hallway again. To my left past the stairs, a ten-foot corridor led directly to the backdoor. Glass shards burdened the wooden floor and old rug, obscured by the frame and its occupant. \n\nWas someone in this house with me? Yet surely they would have seen me, *heard* me in the lounge? I wanted to yell out but I knew better. The picture had fallen to grab my attention, steer me towards something. \n\nI tiptoed past the mess and found myself looking stupidly at another door just to the left of the backdoor. \n\n*Downstairs,* Mr.Eckhart had told me. My skin broke out in gooseflesh. He had been hauling the tools for fire. What had he intended to burn?\n\nI went down two preluding steps and twisted the basement door knob. \n\nInside, it was actually cooler than upstairs. I flicked on the light and went down the flight of stairs, holding the railing the whole time. The steps creaked as my weight prolonged its stay. \n\nIt wasn’t obvious at first, but that cage in the back did some pretty nasty things, did some pretty nasty emotional things. I was sure of it.\n\nThe fluorescent lights were exceptionally bright, allowing me witness to the carefulness of this underground world’s creation. Mr.Eckhart’s basement wasn’t built with the lazy hands of a close drinking buddy, or during the duration of a season, for that matter. Mr.Eckhart’s basement consumed time and money alike. \n\nMr.Eckhart’s basement didn’t have cobwebs or spiders or bugs. It had perfect dimensions and white-washed walls. It had concealed, non-obstructing air vents and its own thermostat. It had immaculate marble floors, a terrible hardness that made it feel like a person was walking through an alien aircraft.\n\nThe metal surfaces of the tables lining the wall on my right were rigid and bare, polished, gleaming. A sink had been built in the middle. I went over to the sink, looked in, and saw a single piece of notebook paper residing in the dry basin. \n\nThe piece of paper was three-quarters filled with Mr.Eckhart’s large-printed handwriting. It was almost as if he had thought writing in pencil diluted some of its finality. It read:\n\n*Somewhere in this room are the tattered bones of three boys. Their ages were five, eight, and nine. The fourth boy was done after the floors were put in. He was thirteen. You’ll find him wrapped in plastic underneath the car in the barn. The car, I touched them in with my dirty hands. The cage, I washed them off in before putting them to rest. I’ve tried for forgiveness within myself in the past ten years since Johnathan, the fourth one. I have been reminded by such forces that it does not forget or forgive.* \n\nWhen I dropped Mr.Eckhart’s confession back into the sink, I turned and looked at the steel bars in the corner through my tears, saw the faucet, saw the drain. In the time it took me to run, I thought about bones crushed by marble. I thought about the additional pressure my weight put on the bones. \n\nI didn’t voice an angry shout or a strangled cry as I ran past the fallen picture in the corridor, back into the kitchen, stumbling through the living room with that couch propped against the front door. I sobbed with a full heart of alleviation, with a relief that summoned me to the envelope nailed to the front door and the money Mr.Eckhart had left for me inside. I cried silently for the forgotten bones underneath the marble, bones that would be forgotten no more. \n\nI waited for my groans to stop. Then, when I could finally compose myself, I waited at the end of the driveway for someone to come.  \n\n                                                                                    \\*\\*\n\nWe all have a duty to let those deserving of life not be forgotten. We often forget that there are forces we cannot understand, protectors of the wild that don’t wear our skin. But they have a consciousness of their own, and I believe that more than I have ever believed in any god. Maybe this is the God everyone gloats about. As my dad would say, “I don’t know, dude, okay?” \n\nSwirling Crayola yellow nightmares plague me, as they have since that day. I don’t get them *every* night, Thank God, but they follow me regularly. Usually, it isn’t the yellow air that haunts me; it’s the man with the smiling sunglasses as black as obsidian.\n\n“*Downstairs*,” he says, and I wake up screaming my head off.\n\nBeth knows I like peace and the unfounded quietness of nature. Her father lives in a small ranch house near the mountains. Wide-open spaces, acres of rolling fields. So, when I told her I had an idea for a new book, expressing concern over this distracting city noise, she suggested I try the ranch house. Yes, her father would be there, but it would be a good bonding experience for us. I’d only met the man a handful of times. He had a bad leg, and was a man who waved off help to preserve his pride. We all know someone like that.\n\nBeth has had things she’s had to deal with in her past, too, even though I’ve never told her about mine. I suppose one day I will, but my tone has always been balanced and calm when she talks about how her mother and her sister disappeared off the face of the earth one day when she was fifteen. The day they had gone missing, she had been spending the night at her grandparents’.\n\nWhen my eyebrows rose, she caught my thinking and reassured me: “Dad was on the road when it happened.” Supposedly, he was hauling some freight across the country and would have been hundreds of miles away. His job had been driving what my fifteen-year-old self would have called ‘the big trucks’. \n\nI’ve always had my doubts about Mr.Benningham. I never told Beth that, though.\n\nI arrived at the ranch house in spite of Mr.Benningham’s stifled mumbling that he didn’t need “old people help”. It was something I reassured him I wouldn’t do, of course. He was too heavy to roll over, and at this, he flicked a glance at me and slowly smiled. He was supposed to use a cane for his bad leg, but I suppose the being seen with it at forty-eight years of age only ages you faster. \n\nFor the first few weeks, we played rummy on the front porch and drank beer that tasted like chilled piss from a cooler every night. Mr.Benningham -*Dereck*, he tells me- has seen just about everything there is out on the road. He tells me stories of drunken scuffles and tales of lonely adventurers out on the Ventura Highway. He doesn’t mention his missing wife and daughter, though. Maybe that’s his way of dealing with the loss. I figure it’s reasonable.   \n\nI was being serious, by the way. I *can* see spring’s golden hue in the evening sky out here. It’s subtle, see, and the yellow days have come and gone here in the piedmont, but something else concerns me. \n\nAs the season progresses, the weeds grow quickly, suffocating the bright green grasses into submission. Mr.Benningham has changed, too. I hear him lumbering around in the night like a lost vagrant.\n\nI find myself cutting them back, these weeds. I’ve seen Mr.Benningham outside with the weed killer, too, spraying the outline of his home and cursing to high heaven. \n\nIn the blackness of these rural nights, I often wonder if my mother-in-law and sister-in-law are in these fields somewhere. I’ve watched as the weeds pile on top of each other, how they appear to be crawling forward like a sneaky green tide.\n\nI plan to know what happened to the girls one way or another, even if it takes all summer.  ",

        "text": "I always thought it was strange that I couldn't remember anything about my childhood. No memories of playing with friends or going on family vacations. It was like my life started when I turned 18.\n\nBut one day, while cleaning out my parent's attic, I found an old photo album. As I flipped through the pages, I saw pictures of myself as a baby, as a toddler, as a young child. I felt a sense of relief, as if I had found a missing piece of myself.\n\nBut as I continued to look through the album, I began to notice something odd. In every single photo of myself, there was a figure standing in the background. A tall, shadowy figure with no discernible features.\n\nI asked my parents about it, but they had no explanation. They claimed they couldn't remember anything about the figure in the photos.\n\nEver since then, I've had a feeling that something is watching me. It's like that figure from my childhood photos has followed me into adulthood, and it's always lurking just out of sight. I can't shake the feeling that it's waiting for something.\n\nThe feeling of being watched only grew stronger as the days passed. I started seeing glimpses of the shadowy figure everywhere I went - in the corner of my eye, in reflections, even in my dreams.\n\nI tried to ignore it, but the figure seemed to be getting bolder. Sometimes it would move so close that I could feel its icy breath on the back of my neck. Other times it would whisper things to me, things I couldn't quite make out but that filled me with a sense of dread.\n\nI started to become paranoid, afraid to leave my house or even turn off the lights at night. And then, one evening, I saw the figure standing in my living room. It was no longer just a shadowy outline - it had taken on a more solid form, with gleaming eyes and razor-sharp claws.\n\nI froze, unable to move as it approached me. I could hear its low growls and feel its hot breath on my face. I closed my eyes, expecting the worst, but when I opened them again, the figure was gone.\n\nBut it had left something behind. In the center of my living room floor was a single, bloody claw mark - a clear warning that it was still watching, still waiting. And I knew then that I was in grave danger.\n\nI spent the next few days in a constant state of terror, never sure when the shadowy figure would strike again. I barely slept, barely ate, barely left my house.\n\nAnd then, one night, I heard a soft scratching sound coming from outside my bedroom window. I cautiously approached the window, heart pounding in my chest, and peered out.\n\nThere it was - the shadowy figure, perched on the windowsill, its glowing eyes fixed on me. In that moment, I knew I had to do something - anything - to protect myself.\n\nI reached for the nearest thing at hand, a heavy book, and flung it at the figure. It struck it with a sickening thud, and the figure let out a chilling screech before disappearing into the darkness.\n\nI thought I was safe. I thought I had won. But then I heard a voice - a voice that sounded like it was coming from inside my head. It said only two words:\n\n\"You're next.\"\n\nAnd that's when I realized that the figure was not just a figment of my imagination - it was a physical manifestation of my deepest fears and darkest thoughts. And now that it had been unleashed, there was no stopping it.\n\nI never saw the shadowy figure again, but I could feel its presence with me every moment of every day. I knew that it was always watching, always waiting for me to slip up, to let my guard down.\n\nAnd then, one day, I simply disappeared. No one knows what happened to me - whether I was abducted, murdered, or simply vanished into thin air. But I know the truth - I was taken by the shadowy figure, the one that had been waiting for me all my life.\n\nAnd now, I am part of it - a shadowy figure myself, lurking in the shadows, waiting for my next victim.",

        "text": " I moved to Piney Point in 1995, shortly after my marriage fell apart. I was already drifting away from my wife, working a brutal corporate job that dulls your capacity for affection. Then my dad fell ill in Houston, and we moved back to Texas to help him see out his last days in dignity. He soon passed, leaving me behind a row house in East Texas and two unopened bottles of Oxycodone. Pretty soon, I was lost at sea. I hardly even remember signing the papers, but I don’t blame her for leaving. Those little blue pills will snatch away a piece of your soul. \n\nI eventually got clean and moved away, figuring the shack my father gifted me would help me disappear. I needed to leave the world, just for a while at least. The rest of my life began that day.\n\nPiney Point’s a tiny, mundane town surrounded by endless acres of the East Texas forest. Folks around here call the woods “The Big Thicket,” which stretches over 54,000 miles across five states. I found my sense of purpose in the Big Thicket. Exploring the woods teeming with nature slowly brought me back to life. The townies teased me about spending so much time there, jokingly referring to me as the “Forest Ranger” even though I worked at the local bank. \n\nWhat makes our neck of the woods so special is that we have a specific species of Lyrebirds. You can find Lyrebirds all over North America, but those living here are native to Australia. The founder of this town, Leamon Tuttle, brought the superb fowl back to Texas after spending some time in the Outback. He raised them on his property, and they were carelessly released into the wild after he passed, soon becoming almost invasive.  I love the birds. My house is filled with drawings of them, puffing out their tails shaped like Apollo’s golden lute. \n\nIf you don’t know about them, Lyrebirds are amazing creatures. First, they’ve been around for fifteen million years, practically making them living dinosaurs. Secondly, they can mimic almost any sound. Most of the time, they copy the sounds of other birds to attract mates, but they’ve also been observed mimicking human sounds. They sing car alarms, chainsaws, and can even pick up remnants of conversations from human passerbys. \n\nI walk on the trails during my lunch break every afternoon to reset my brain for the day.  It also helps me power through any stress I might be having. Even though I’ve been sober for almost thirty years, unresolved tension can move the needle toward falling off the wagon. I am not going through opioid withdrawal ever again. \n\nDuring this walk, I heard an exciting call that resembled a kookaburra’s. Kookaburras don’t reside anywhere else, but in Australia and New Guinea, so it had to have been a Lyrebird. I was in awe that the Lyrebirds remembered one of their long-lost cousins from the homeland. I sat on a nearby stump to take in the sounds of nature when I suddenly heard a human voice.\n\n*“I SEE YOU!”*\n\nI whipped around, looking for the culprit, only to see a large male Lyrebird nipping into the ground for bugs. He perched his head up and sang his cry again.\n\n*“i sEe YoU!”* The song now sounded more like it came from a bird, without a human’s cadence. It must have been a younger male, still working on his craft. I studied the bird for a bit when I heard a louder call.\n\n“*whY arE YoU RuNNiNg FrOM mE?”*\n\nI was so startled I nearly jumped out of my boots. Another Lyrebird sauntered by echoing the same call before switching to the sound of a woodpecker. I composed myself and then continued on the trail, realizing I was late for work. The calls were definitely copied from a human’s voice, but looking back, they didn’t really sound human. The voice was deeper and more visceral. I began to feel unsettled and hurried back to my office, yet I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease until I got ready for bed. Were the birds talking to me? Was it someone else?\n\nThe following day was Saturday, which meant I was going on a longer hike. One of my coworkers said they ran into an alligator, so I was interested in spotting the elusive creature to draw in my trailbook. It was a beautiful Saturday morning, but the woods felt unusually sleepy. I followed my coworker's directions to carefully reach the alligator habitat when I suddenly heard another voice. \n\n‘*HELP!”*\n\nI froze. It sounded like a young girl’s voice and couldn’t have been more than twenty feet away. My eyes darted around, looking to find the noise source, but I saw nothing but endless trees. That’s when I heard it again.\n\n*“SOMEBODY HELP ME!”*\n\nI sprinted north toward the voice, borrowing through the pines and bushes, not even wincing when thorns dug into my skin. “Hello!?” I screamed. Nothing called back in response. “Where are you!?” I yelled, frantically looking around.\n\n“*PLEASE! IT’S GOING TO GET ME!”*\n\nI ran harder than ever before until I lost my footing and tripped over a tree root. I tumbled forward, feeling the earth cut, gnaw, and scrape at my skin. My glasses were knocked off my head, and I fumbled around on the damp ground looking for them. I put them on and found myself in an area of the forest I’d never seen before.\n\nIt was a beautiful meadow surrounded by pine trees, even more prominent than the ones I was used to. White dogwood flowers covered the ground, and American beautyberry bushes were everywhere. How had I never seen this place before? \n\nIn the middle of the meadow was an ancient-looking stone cross covered in moss. I could faintly hear the sound of rushing water in the distance, but other than that, the field was silent. It was strange how quiet it was in a place usually teeming with nature. I could almost hear my organs working to keep me alive. I walked to the cross to study it when I heard the voice again.\n\n“HELP ME, PLEASE! I’M BEGGING YOU.”\n\nI quickly turned around, none other to see a Lyrebird trotting in the distance. The Lyrebird perched its head up and whistled again, nipping at the ground for a worm. I shook my head in disbelief and walked toward the stone cross, hoping to find my way out of the forest. \n\n“FOUND YOU!” \n\nI darted around to look at the Lyrbird. It was the same disembodied voice from yesterday, though it sounded far more coherent. \n\n“FOUND YOU!” The voice cried again. But to my horror, the sound wasn’t coming from the bird who was now gone. I whipped around but just saw an open field. I had never felt more alone in my entire life.\n\n“**found you…”** The voice said again, only this time it was whispering in my ear. I bolted, running on a path toward nowhere, desperately trying to get back home. The sounds of bird calls grew louder, and I felt like the forest was screaming at me to leave forever. I somehow, miraculously, made it back home to my house.\n\nI threw my stuff down and made a call to the sheriff. Something terrible had happened, and someone was in trouble that I knew. I wasn’t sure exactly what was going on, but whatever it was, the Lyrebirds picked it up. The Sheriff, someone I knew personally, said he would be right over to take down my statement. I waited by the door, feeling like a nervous wreck.\n\nSheriff Hodge knocked on my door, but I was startled to see the local family doctor, Bill Taylor, with him. Sheriff Hodge and Dr. Taylor weren’t interested in my statement. They were there to do a welfare check on me. I was adamant that they were wasting time talking to me and needed to send a search team out there immediately. “Well, Carl, how do you know someone is in danger?” Sherriff Hodge cautiously asked me.\n\n“The birds told me!” I yelled but soon realized how ridiculous that sounded. I tried to explain about the Lyrebirds picking up what happened, but Dr. Taylor peppered me with questions about my own mental well-being. I grew frustrated and lunged at him, only to be taken to the ground by Sherriff Hodge. Another officer came to put me in cuffs, and I found myself first in the back of a squad car and then in a small holding cell.\n\nAnother doctor came to talk to me, asking me pointed questions about the voices I heard and referencing my psychological file. Yes, I was aware I used to be addicted to opioids. Yes, I suffered from terrible withdrawal symptoms. Yes, I experienced feelings of…..psychosis. No, I had not been experiencing those symptoms again. No, I was not using again. Yes, I think someone is in danger. YES, IT WAS BECAUSE THE BIRDS TOLD ME. NO, I WILL NOT CALM DOWN. SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED IN THE WOODS. WHAT ARE YOU INJECTING INTO ME?\n\nDarkness. Then bliss. I felt myself being rocked slowly to sanity by whatever tranquilizer they gave me. I remembered this feeling all too well. Dr. Taylor refused to press charges against me if I promised to see a shrink. The other doctor, whose name I don’t recall, gave me a prescription for anti-psychotics. I was escorted back home and drifted off into sleep. I dreamt of that meadow, piecing together in my dream that it was the key to finding out what happened. I just needed to get back there somehow. If the police weren’t going to help me, fine. FINE!\n\nI’ll find that girl myself, even if I have to camp in the woods.\n\nI made preparations, bought a new tent, and started the hike. I will find out just what the hell is going on here. I’ve brought my laptop to document what I find, just in case something happens to me.\n\n………………………………………….\n\nIt’s been about three hours, and I’m slightly embarrassed to admit I’m lost. I’ve taken several trails and gone off the beaten path, but I can’t find this damn meadow anywhere. I accidentally stumbled upon it, but I’ve lost my bearings entirely. Maybe I need to call off this search and head home. I can try again tomorrow.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nIt’s getting dark, and I’m starting to get anxious. I can’t even find the way back to my own house! I’ve combed these woods for almost thirty years, yet I’m literally running in circles. Is this the trail back? No, that doesn’t make any sense. I’ve gone that way already. It’s strange how quiet it is out here….not even the Lyrebirds are singing their songs today. Wait, was that someone in the distance running through the trees? Better go flag them down.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nIt’s pitch black out now, and I can’t believe I forgot a damn flashlight. I lost that figure running through the woods, and now I’m even more lost. Jesus Christ, it’s so dark out here. I’ve hunkered down in my tent. The new day will get me back home. I’m never coming back here alone at night again.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\n*“HELP!!!! SOMEBODY HELP ME, PLEASE!!!!!!! IS ANYONE OUT HERE….HELP!!!!”*\n\nThe Lyrebirds are singing again. The song is different this time….so familiar….so close…... But I’m not unzipping this tent.\n\n“*HELP ME PLEASE!!!!!! OH GOD, IT’S COMING……HELP…..”*\n\nThe voice is getting even louder like it’s sprinting toward me. I’ve plugged my ears, but it sounds like it’s inside my brain. The voice….it’s…..it’s…..\n\nIt’s mine.\n\n….help me please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Piney Point Tales](https://www.reddit.com/r/PineyPointTales/)",

        "text": "I’ll be telling the tale of the past nine days. Recently, there have been three disappearances in my neighbourhood, and I was almost one of them.\n\nI usually go outside every Saturday at 10 to get some snacks in a nice spooky night. I always appreciated the dark nights, yet I never knew darkness would hold true danger until recently. 9 days ago on Saturday I went to the local store to get some crisps and soda when I saw somebody in the distance. It seemed to have grey skin, yet I could not make out the precise colours in the dark. Its nails seemed like ruthless claws and their eyes were pure black. I thought that it was likely a normal human being who happened to be trick-or-treating 3 months late. 30 minutes later I was resting in my bed, tired and ready to sleep.\n\nSomehow a strange feeling of dread filled me. I slept well, yet the next day the dread continued to fill me. At the time I didn't think much of it, although I had no idea of where this feeling came from. I am still uncertain if this feeling has anything to do with the sighting.\n\nThe second day things got worse. Before going to bed I watched the moon out of my window, and saw the same figure walking in my neighbourhood. That night I had the worst nightmares I have had in years. I dreamed of terror, loss and the creature himself.\n\nThe next day the dread and nightmares continued. I saw the creature again. I saw the creature through my front door, standing without knocking. I watched it for 5 more minutes. It would not move. I went upstairs to my window to see him still standing without knocking. I slept very little that night, perhaps an hour at best. It would appear that insomnia was added to my continued nightmares and dread. The next day I woke up again to try to live a normal life, filled by silent dread and paranoia.\n\nI worked all day, always fearing the creature would see me as a lazy snack. That night when I went  to sleep I almost screamed as I saw the being in my kitchen, silently looking straight at my eyes. I quickly went to my bed to sleep another day.\n\nMadness had arrived. I was stressed all day and night, awaiting punishment. I barely worked that day, fearing the creature. I had now began to see that the torture of the past few days was all caused by the monster. I began to realize that all the people who disappeared in my neighborhood stayed inside for exactly a week before disappearing. I began to think that perhaps in a few days I may die. I heard screams that night. That night I saw the creature in my bedroom, still not saying a word.\n\nMy phone, keys, hat, pencils and three novels disappeared the next day. Madness was intensifying. I could no longer think without thinking of the beast. I could no longer do a thing. I stayed locked up, never sleeping. At midnight, after not seeing the being I went to sleep. That night I saw a being in my bed when I woke up. It said nothing, by then I was getting used to seeing it. What I feared was the idea of it.\n\nI could not think that day. I did not go to work. I tried to eat to distract myself, but it didn’t work. I went to bed early, despite sleeping very little. I woke up at midnight to see the beast in my bed once again, staring blankly at my eyes. It whispered the words: \"I am Unknown.\" Then I saw my feet disintegrating. Initially I did not even think of that, until I soon realized that soon I will be nothing but rotten dust. I ran from that bed and screamed. My feet were gone. I didn’t know how I was walking. \"Go away!\" I screamed. I heard no answer or any reaction. I was still standing, just as before. \"Death.\" muttered the being. I hid downstairs, thinking of my life. I was spared by the monster. My feet were returned, but I have now become hard of hearing. Yet I was lucky. The other disappeared individuals of the neighbourhood died 7 days after torture began to them.\n\nTwo days later, I am sitting, writing this. The symptoms of torture continue, despite being lighter. I don’t know what to call this being. I personally call it an \"Unknown\", after the words it muttered in my bed. I still fear every day that it shall come back.",

        "text": "Long forgotten memories often resurface violently when you least expect it. Years of therapy had suppressed even the memory of having suppressed it. All it took for it punch through my subconscious was the simple act of turning the light off in my daughters' shared bedroom. In the sudden darkness everything came flooding back and I was a child again, no older than my oldest, back in the bedroom I shared with my younger brother. \n\nI saw it standing over my little brother's bed. Joe was asleep. The only light in the room was the red flame from the candle in its hand. It was tall, lanky, and stood bent over my brother. Long moon-silver hair lit by reddish candle light flowed from its head and draped over its crooked shoulders. \n\nIt carried a sack. \n\nSomething stirred inside it and I gasped. I'm sure I did, because just then it turned around. Sometimes I remember the — the — thing turning to me, like it knew I was awake. I quickly shut my eyes. I was going to die. It was going to throw me in its sack and take me away. I'd never see my parents or Joe ever again. I was sure of it. It would take me and do every horrible thing I could think of. \n\nSmall comfort that I couldn't think of much at five.\n\nI kept my eyes closed. I felt it loom over me, felt its breath on me. It stood by my bed waiting for me to open my eyes — to take a peek. I held my breath. I held my scream. I prayed for mom or dad to open the door. \n\nJust throw open the door, let the light in, and this thing would disappear. I was sure of it. \n\nAll I had to do was turn the light on. The switch was right next to my bed. I just had to do reach out and hit the switch...\n\nWhy did I hesitate? Why was I so slow?\n\nI heard Joe stir just as I felt the air relax around me. I dared to sneak a peak. My brother was sitting on his bed, rubbing his eyes. The tall evil thing dragged its feet towards his bed. It moved slowly like a thing from a dream.\n\nNow! Do it now! \n\nWhen I revisit this scene in my nightmares, that's the command that rings in my head as I wake up, sweating.\n\nI hesitated. \n\nJoe opened his eyes. Just a crack. That shouldn't count. It's not fair. I don't think he even knew what he saw. \n\nAs I saw the thing bring the candle closer to its mouth, every fiber in my being told me to do it — reach for the switch. But the switch was in the darkness, outside the safe zone of my bed and protective blanket. \n\nIts gnarly, wrinkled lips went round, and its leathery cheeks puffed up. Whatever — whoever — was inside the sack stirred again. \n\nI plunged my hands into the darkness, putting my whole body into the thrust. I threw myself off the  bed. \n\nThe switch clicked a moment after I heard the candle go out. Bright fluorescent light flooded the room, stinging my eyes. \n\nWhen they adjusted to the light, I was alone in our room.\n\nNowadays I have cameras in my daughters' room. I get my sleep when I can but never at night. I wait with the lights on.",

        "text": " \n\nA passing boat found me face down on the bank caked in mud.\n\nI woke up in a hospital with nurses checking monitors and officers firing questions into my skull that I had no answer to. After all, how do four people and a boat disappear just ten minutes after leaving the boat ramp? For them it was ten minutes, for me, it was much longer.\n\nTwo days of running. Two days of questioning if the next few moments would be my last. Two days of watching my friends disappear one after the other. Two days trapped in an unknown place running from things god himself disowned. \n\nIt was just supposed to be a weekend catching up with friends. Time filled with laughs and cold drinks. We made a tradition of getting together every few months to spend the weekend doing whatever our minds could conjure. This specific weekend we settled on fishing. Can’t say it’s my favorite thing to do in the world, but the company definitely makes up for it.\n\nHonestly, I wonder if anyone who reads this will believe what I’m about to tell you. The endless loop constantly playing in my head tells me it happened. I can still hear the low bellow erupting from that–thing.\n\nI’m writing this down as a sort of warning. To maybe help at least one person from making the same mistake we did.\n\nSo here it is, my story. An account of the two days spent trapped in an endless marsh.\n\nWe all planned to meet up at five am at the boat launch. I somehow managed to arrive about ten minutes early. The boat was already in the water. Blake, who's our captain, was walking around making sure everything was in working order. Anthony and Marc were on the dock no doubt mocking Blake. The only accomplice missing now was Ryan which wasn’t a surprise. I don’t think he has ever shown up to anything on time.\n\nFifteen minutes after the designated time Ryan finally arrived. Thus, starting the early morning banter.\n\n“I’m glad you could bless us with your presence,” Marc said while reaching to shake Ryan’s hand which would no doubt contain as much force his 170-pound frame could muster. Ryan who is 6’2 and built like a brick wall gripped Marc’s hand tight until slowly he crumpled to his knees which gave us all a good laugh, well, except for Marc.\n\n“Nice to see you too Marc,” Ryan responded with a grin that stretched ear to ear, “and everyone else, sorry I’m late to the party, missed my first alarm.”\n\n“I’ll forgive you, but only if you go get the extra fuel from the back of my truck,” Blake said while squeezing Ryan’s bicep, “use that ape strength for other things besides tormenting Marc.”\n\nWe continued catching up while helping Blake with preparations before we disembarked. It was good catching up and the tiredness I felt upon arrival was leaving and was replaced by excitement. There was something else mixed in with it though. Like the feeling you get when your phone rings in the middle of the night or get called into your boss's office unexpectedly. Anxiety was welling up inside me for no known reason.\n\nObviously, I chalked it up to the energy drink I had earlier and just being jittery about being on a boat. We finished up the final preparations and Blake switched the motors on. Blake leaned out an open window and called out to us.\n\n“All aboard the Oar Knot, we hope for smooth sailing and sunny skies,” Blake announced triumphantly. \n\nYes, you read that correctly. He named the boat Oar Knot. *Hilarious.*\n\nWe were making good time. We still had almost an hour before the sun was supposed to rise. Plenty of time to get out to the open water. Blake was traversing the channels like a pro, there was no telling how many times he has driven down them. He runs fishing charters some weekends to make a little extra cash so he could probably go gown these channels blindfolded. \n\nAfter about thirty minutes of riding, I left Ryan and Blake inside and made my way out to the front of the boat to talk to Anthony and Marc. Something caught my eye as I was making my way up to them. Right past the bend on the channel we were on there was a wall of fog, it looked more like a cloud it was so thick. It was strange, it seemed to only encompass a small area over the water without stretching very far off into the reeds. Anthony noticed it about the same time I did and got Marc’s attention off of his phone and pointed off at the fog in the distance.\n\n“Weird,” Anthony stated turning his head to look at me and Marc, “never seen fog that dense before, how about you Cade?”\n\nI shook my head before he started up again.\n\n“I sure hope Blake plans to slow down a bit. I’m not dissing his skills or anything, but I can’t see the other side at a–.”\n\nAs if on cue the engines slowed significantly causing the boat to lurch forward. We were thrown and I had to grab onto a seat in order to not hit the ground. The boat retreated to a slow coast forward as Blake peered out the door with a grin. I’m pretty sure he did that hard on purpose.\n\n“Sorry guys I couldn’t resist, come on in here there’s something I want you all to see.”\n\nWe did as ordered and went in to see Ryan standing next to Blake in his captain’s chair.\n\n“The weather channel didn’t call for fog this morning,” Blake said pointing at one of the displays that had the weather data on it, “all my time running down these channels I’ve never seen fog that thick. Looks like a bunch of cotton balls wadded together.”\n\n“Maybe there’s a fire somewhere,” Anthony responded looking around for confirmation.\n\n“I don’t smell smoke, plus doesn’t it look almost stagnant to you guys? I know it’s not real breezy today but it looks almost frozen to me,” Marc said as he raised a hand to his chin squinting like he was trying to zoom in on it.\n\nHe was right though. The more I looked it just seemed off. I looked at one of the displays above the steering wheel and sure enough, I saw that the wind speed was supposed to be eight miles an hour. \n\nAn unsettling feeling crept into my gut as I tried to wrap my head around the oddity we were headed towards. The closer we got the faster my heart beat until finally we were only about twenty yards away. The high beams of light coming from the boat didn’t look like they penetrated even an inch, they bounced off it like a solid surface. The boat slowed even more as we prepared to go through.\n\n“I can’t see a thing,” Blake said as we were only now a mere ten yards away, “luckily it’s a straight shot through. Everyone hold on just in case we bump into something.”\n\n“Aye aye captain,” Ryan responded no doubt trying to ease the tension hanging in the air.\n\n“Here we go,” Blake said as the fog started swallowing the front end of the boat.\n\nI braced, white-knuckling a handlebar next to the door. Closer and closer it came. I watched as it devoured the rest of the front of the boat then the small table and bench vanished right outside the window. Sweat was collecting in small beads on my forehead. Then it was right at the window. As soon as it made contact every light and electronic on the boat went out.\n\nMy stomach dropped like I had just missed a step, no that doesn’t really capture the feeling, this persisted, like cresting the hill on a roller coaster then plummeting nearly straight down.\n\n“Hey! — HEY!”\n\n“Christ Marc! Don’t scream in my ear like that, we’re still here,” Blake retorted as the sound of rummaging began, “Where did I put that flashlight? The electronics just got checked on this thing last week, I can’t wait till I see those people from the shop when I get back,” the clattering of objects ceased, “Here we are!”\n\nLight flooded the cabin. I threw my hands up to shield my eyes due to Blake switching a flashlight on pointed directly at me. After we all regained our bearings and the bright circles that danced through my vision left, we all looked to see if the fog had passed. My stomach was still doing somersaults, I was doing my best not to see that sausage biscuit for the second time. We were still surrounded by fog.\n\n“What is this man,” Ryan said as he put a hand to the window, “I’ve drove through some thick fog before during my cross-country routes with my rig but this is insane.”\n\n“I think it’s finally starting to thin a little,” I said as the flashlight Blake was holding started to break through the soupy mist.\n\n“Thank god,” Blake stated with an exasperated sigh, “it would’ve taken us forever to reach the open water at that speed.”\n\nLights and electronics whizzed back to life as the final traces of the fog dissipated. Relief washed over me and I’m sure everyone else.\n\n“All right,” Blake said raising an arm in the air, “back in business bab –”\n\nAll of us looked at Blake who raised a hand onto one of the displays.\n\n“Strange. Something’s up with the GPS. It can’t find our location.”\n\nAs I looked closer the normal arrow that shows the location of the boat wasn’t there, also in the top right corner there was a message in all caps.\n\n*SIGNAL LOST*\n\nMy heart rate quickened again. Sure it could have just been an electrical error, but I don’t know, the air around us somehow felt, off. I pulled out my phone to check my GPS, I had no service but that was normal out here. The GPS works without service anyways so I tried it. The blue arrow was gone on it as well. I tried to calm myself as I looked at my friends.\n\n“Would you guys mind checking your GPS on your phones? I’m sure it’s just a fluke, but mine isn’t working either.”  \n\nI watched as I saw everyone reach for their phones and begin swiping. Without even saying anything I knew they saw the same screens I did by the looks on their faces. We looked at each other for a moment and it looked like Anthony was about to say something but it was cut off as the boat began to shake slightly, then our silent surroundings erupted with noise.\n\nA loud, deep droning sound drowned out everything around us. The closest thing I can compare it to is a huge freighter blowing its horn, but that's still pretty far off. Another problem with this idea was that we should be miles away from any paths a ship of that size could fit down. Sure we might hear them in the distance, but this one sounded way too close. I had to cover my ears at this point because it kept getting louder. I couched down pressing my palms harder and harder over my ears as the noise grew. I thought it started off loud, but the longer I sat with my ears covered the more its volume increased. My chest felt like it was about to explode. All my organs were vibrating like what you would feel at a concert during a song with heavy bass. Even still, the noise kept building up until I was screaming trying to drown out the sound to no avail. Finally, after reaching an ear-shattering crescendo it abruptly stopped.\n\nI still sat crouched covering my ears for some time after it stopped. Eventually, I felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up to see Ryan mouthing something my still ringing ears couldn’t decipher. I slowly stood up on my shaking legs as Ryan was still trying to talk to deaf ears. How he could still hear was a mystery. After a little while longer my hearing started to return.\n\n“What in gods name was that?” Ryan said asking a group of people who had just as good of an idea as him.\n\n“I think we need to get out of here,” Marc said still rubbing his ears, “I don’t know what that was but I want to get as far away from it as I can.”\n\nI nodded in agreement as everyone else unanimously agreed with him.\n\nBlake started turning the vessel around before stopping all of his motions at once. We all froze as we looked out at the impossible happening at the bank. How should I describe this? The impenetrable fog that was there just minutes ago was gone. The crazy thing is that wasn’t the strangest part. The bank now had electric blue lines running through it, pulsing the color in various strengths. The mounting fear inside of me was finally beginning to bubble over.\n\nI’m almost certain we all felt it. A creeping realization was settling deep in my bones, I knew we were somewhere we shouldn’t be and that fog brought us here. I tried my best to regain my composure because I could see the others becoming more unhinged by the second. All except for Ryan who bore his usual stoic expression, but even that was faltering slightly.\n\n“We need to get out of here, now,” I turned my gaze away from the odd sight just out of the window to look at Blake. \n\nHe managed to tear his vision from the window to look at me and nod. He put his hand on the throttle and kept pushing up until we were racing back the way we came. We all found places to sit inside as we drove. It was only a few minutes and I was sure we weren’t nearing the boat launch yet, but Blake began decelerating. He was wearing a confused expression.\n\n“No no this isn’t right.”\n\n“What’s up Blake,” I said walking up to his seat.\n\n“I know for certain we are supposed to take a left here, why is it going right?”\n\n“Are you sure, I mean it is still dark out?”\n\n“I’ve been this way hundreds of times with my dad. I know where I’m going Marc.”\n\n“Sorry man, I didn’t mean it to come off like that. What does this mean then?”\n\nAnthony spoke up this time, “I think we all know what it means, I’ve been thinking it since we heard that noise,” he paused for a moment readjusting himself in a chair, “I think that fog took us somewhere.”\n\n“C’mon man, you watch too many movies,” Ryan responded.\n\n“You got a better idea then?”\n\n“Yeah, as much as I hate to say it Blake must have made a wrong tu–.”\n\n“I didn’t!” Blake yelled as he stood up out of his chair. He always had a pretty short fuse and this situation was not doing it any favors.\n\n“Woah woah guys, let’s all just take a minute to think,” I said walking in between them, “I know were all a little on edge right now so let’s just chill out for a minute.”\n\nEventually, after a slightly less heated discussion, we decided to press on. We figured we had to still be on the right track and maybe Blake would spot something that would help him get his bearings back.\n\nI was just sitting with my face pressed nearly to the glass trying to take my mind off things. I swear for the slightest moment I thought I saw something moving in the reeds. I decided against saying anything as there was already a pretty heavy atmosphere in the room. I was probably just seeing things anyway due to my own heightened state.\n\n“Is that a light?” Anthony said breaking the silence and I turned to see where he was looking.\n\n“Yeah,” Blake responded, “it shouldn’t take us too long to get over there, maybe they will be able to tell us what’s going on out here.”\n\nI couldn’t stop the tension building in me the closer we got. The light from the unknown source was growing by the second until finally, we rounded the final corner and the source of the light finally came into view. It was another boat that sat right at the edge of the channel. The only light on the boat was a huge lightbar mounted on the stern, the rest of the boat was dark. I was concerned but my mind allowed a sliver of hope to infiltrate it. Just maybe someone was on this boat and they would be able to help us out.\n\nThe boat was about 35 feet long which was a tad smaller than the one we were currently on. Up top was an enclosed space surrounded by large windows all the way around which housed the cockpit. I could tell by the build it also had room below which was probably the sleeping quarters. I don’t know for sure because I never saw it entirely.\n\nPulling up beside the boat we all called out trying to warrant a response. One never came but we did notice the boat rocking slightly and also heard some commotion on the inside. Me, Ryan, and Anthony decided to board the vessel to see who was on it. We figured they probably needed help since they weren’t responding to our calls. We all grabbed flashlights and got ready to board.\n\nI was the last to cross over and when I did I slipped on the wet siding and nearly fell into the pitch-black water below, luckily Anthony caught me just in time. When my foot finally landed on the wood paneling all the commotion we previously heard was gone.\n\n“Anyone here,” Ryan called out as he stepped into the cabin with us trailing behind, “we’re here to help, you see, we’re sort of lost out here ourselves.”\n\nSilence. Inside there were definitely signs that people had been there. I saw an open soda along with a half-eaten granola bar that rested on a small wooden table. It looked like they were interrupted right in the middle of their meal. That uneasy feeling started working its way through me again. Honestly, I just wanted off of the boat at this point. After checking the rest of the top level Ryan began making his way down the narrow set of stairs he barely fit in to try the door that lead into the hull of the ship. He finally reached it and turned. I heard it rattle in his grip.\n\n“Locked,” Ryan said as he turned to look at us, then turned back around to lightly knocked on the door a few times, “hello, anyone in there?”\n\nHe made his way back up the few stairs and we started looking around to try to find a key or something. It was pretty hard to see because we had to use our phones' flashlights to search. We should have grabbed actual flashlights from our boat. Anthony was searching the drawers next to the cockpit and found what we were looking for.\n\n“I think I found the key,” Anthony announced while waving a lanyard with a small key at the end victoriously.\n\nHe passed by me and Ryan and made his way down the stairs sliding the key into the lock and twisting. The door creaked as it slowly began to open. It was about a quarter of the way when I noticed the light from Anthony’s phone catch something in the darkness behind the door. It seemed to recoil from the light because it was gone as soon as I thought I saw it. Then the door exploded open sending Anthony flying backwards. \n\nHe hit the stairs hard which evidently knocked his breath out of him because he was wheezing hard. What happened next froze me in place. A viscous black arm extended out of the darkness and grabbed Anthony’s leg which caused him to shriek in pain as black claws dug into his flesh. Terror grabbed my soul like a vice grip. I was possessed by it. My mind was screaming at me to run but my legs were not responding to my mind's orders. Luckily, Ryan moved first, grabbing a metal folding chair that was positioned close by the stairs and bringing it down hard on the arm which caused it to release its grip. It then retreated back into the darkness of the cabin. \n\nBlake and Marc were yelling at us as we stepped back into the crisp night air. My body was on autopilot as Ryan carried Anthony’s limp body in his arms. Ryan handed Anthony off to them so he could cross back over without falling in. I followed behind him nearly stepping on his heels. I leaped over when he finally got across lost my footing and crashed hard onto the deck. \n\nThey were wrapping Anthony's leg up when I finally got to my feet. Ryan was practically screaming at Blake to get away from the boat. He was trying to help Anthony but when he saw Ryan's expression he got up and went over immediately. \n\nWe peeled out of there as soon as the engines started. I looked back and saw the boat shaking violently. Then a dark figure leapt out into the reeds.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of cleaning and bandaging Anthony’s wound the best our limited medical supplies could offer, we took him into the cabin below to lay him on one of the twin mattresses to rest. I was sort of glad he passed out because it would have been a job to keep him still while we worked on him. \n\nWe all gathered around Blake to discuss our options. Luckily me and Ryan weren’t questioned too hard about what had happened. They both had a pretty good view from our boat. We tried to call emergency services but just like the GPS there was no connection, I don’t believe we had much hope of that working anyway. We ended up deciding to keep pressing forward. We drove a pretty good while making idle chit-chat to keep our minds off our situation. It was pretty hard though when every once in a while you came up on a boat that would be sitting empty.\n\nWe would pull up beside them to shine our flashlights inside. We decided to get them out of storage after the incident on the boat. I proposed the idea that whatever those things were didn’t like light after seeing it move away from Anthony’s phone light. We also made another discovery that had somehow escaped our minds until Marc brought it up.\n\n“Has anyone checked the time recently?”\n\nI pulled my phone out of my pocket to check. The lock screen with a picture of my dog Red was there to greet me along with something I couldn't believe. *10:35 AM.* \n\nMarc spoke up again because none of us were saying anything, “Where’s the sun at?”\n\nI don’t know why I wasn’t as shocked as I should have been. None of us were. Maybe we would be if we hadn’t seen everything else that has unfolded since we left the boat ramp this morning. \n\nWhy did we decide to go [fishing](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoullessHQ/)?",

I knew the kid’s name- Smitty. I had seen him around town many times but never spoken with him. He was autistic, only talked rarely and always had a thousand-yard stare. I knew from Bud Beacon taking him to the ranger station that Smitty had a lot of weird obsessions about food- he would only eat food or drink drinks that were white or clear, so he ate a lot of rice, pasta, milk and other staples, and drank a lot of water. Any food or drink that had any color other than white or transparency to it disgusted him to no end. If someone tried to give him some, he would close his mouth, turn his head away and refuse to speak to that person for the rest of the day.\n\n“So,” Wickie said from my left, “are we just going to run into the woods and shoot anything that moves?”\n\n“I don’t really have any better ideas,” I admitted. “Maybe that two-headed bear will come back and save us. I wish I could have talked to him more. He seems to be the only one who really knows what’s going on around here.”\n\n“I really wouldn’t count on him bailing us out,” Wickie said. “He must be getting sick of us.” I only shrugged.\n\n“Well, as you know, my goal is to live forever,” I said sarcastically. “So far, so good. If I’ve made it this far, why not just keep going? Everything always seems to work out in the end.” Wickie pulled a joint out of his pocket, lighting it and taking a deep hit. The sun was rapidly setting, the forest gaining an eerie, shadowy look that made it hard to see very far down the trail. “And by the way,” I continued, “the bear is not a *he.* It is a they, and their names are Growlf and Rowlf. They told me.”\n\nThen, a horrendous smell started to waft over to us. It wasn’t the smell of all the dank weed Wickie was smoking, either. This smell was *so* strong that it immediately overpowered the smell of the cannabis. And, to my terror, it was a smell I recognized- the smell of burning metal combined with rotting meat. It was the smell of the creatures with the long arms and pale white flesh who had attacked us earlier.\n\n“Um, Wickie…” I began to say, but he threw the half-smoked joint casually in the brush and just nodded.\n\n“Yeah, I know, bud,” he said calmly, his eyes red and slightly squinted as he looked around, a big shit-eating grin on his face. Looking at him, you would think we were at an amusement park rather than a cursed forest. “They’re definitely back. We’re being watched.” But nothing came out of the brush at us. I could smell the monstrosities, but it appeared the mark from the two-headed bear really worked. I was passing through without being attacked by the monsters of the forest. \n\nI had a feeling the bear’s mark wouldn’t work on everything, though. As we hiked further ahead in the dark, turning on our flashlights, the smell faded further and further behind us. We heard twigs snapping and bushes being pushed aside in the twilight darkness all around us, but we continued on unmolested. The few shots of alcohol I had taken before leaving to calm my nerves had totally worn off, and I felt a rising sense of anxiety building up inside my chest.\n\nAs we neared the site at the end of the trail where I had been told there was a sacrificial altar, a new smell began to arise. It was the odor of burning plastic. A monstrous conglomeration of many bodies stepped out from behind an ancient oak tree to my right, blocking the path. I raised my pistol, a model called the Judge that fired shotgun shells.\n\n“Growlf and Rowlf gave me the mark! I demand passage!” I yelled, pointing the pistol at its face, where a monstrous single eye flicked back and forth, looking at me then Wickie then back at me again. “Move aside, beast. Move aside, let us pass, or I’ll kill you! I really will!” I hoped I sounded a lot braver than I felt. It felt like my voice was trembling, and I could feel my heart racing. I kept the flashlight tucked under my armpit as I took a deep breath in and tried to steady the gun and calm my nerves.\n\n“Fool!” the monster cried in front of me. “I am not bound by the laws of this forest. I was created from corpses in a secret location. The mark of the protector bear has no effect on me.\n\n“I will give you two standing here one last chance- turn around, never come back here, and I will let you live. For I am Rakka, the strong, the unkillable, but the forgiving for those who repent,” the monster said, blowing fetid air in our direction out of his reeking mouth as he yelled. The trees shook around us, and I heard birds and bats fleeing in droves as leaves fell from the tallest branches, showering the forest.\n\n“OK, listen up here, Rakka,” Wickie said, stepping in front of me, “no one tells us where we can go or what we can do. And there’s a kid back there we’re supposed to bring back. If you’re so strong, why do you take mere children?” Rakka laughed, a deep, gurgling sound that reminded me of slug slime and moldy, rotting leaves on the bottom of a lake. It sounded wet, sickly, phlegmy and, overall, just disturbing.\n\nI heard movement behind Rakka, and men and women in black robes started to step out, forming a semicircle. Both Wickie and I had our guns pointed at the new arrivals, yet they seemed totally unafraid.\n\n“Hail Rakka the Great, the Strong, the Unkillable!” said a tall blonde woman in the front. The rest of them shouted in unison, “Hail!”\n\n“Hey, you guys stole that from the Nazis! Pretty lame, losers,” Wickie said, laughing.\n\n“Actually, I think the Nazis stole it from the ancient Romans,” I said. “You know, the whole ‘Hail Caesar’ thing…” Wickie gave me a sour sideways look, frowning. The cult members and the monster in front of us totally ignored our conversation.\n\n“The child is ours,” Rakka said, smiling a grin with far too many teeth, many of them appeared rotted and blackened, but still sharp and extremely long. “I am done being patient. If you take one step forward, I will kill you both.” I took one step forward. Rakka’s single eye widened in surprise as I raised the gun and began shooting at the cult members behind him. I knew from previous experience that shooting Rakka did no good, but that was a problem I’d have to deal with later- probably in about thirty seconds.\n\nWickie followed my lead, firing his .22 at the center mass and heads of the cult members. Within seconds, all of them were on the ground, dying or dead, blood soaking into the dried leaves of the forest floor.\n\nWith a roar, Rakka began to rush forwards towards me, and then everything happened very fast.\n\nFrom my right, a loud rustling started, and out popped the two-headed bear, Growlf and Rowlf. He sprinted out on all fours from a cluster of bushes nearby, slamming into Rakka with an amazing speed and sending him flying twenty feet off the trail and directly into the trunk of a huge evergreen tree. The branch went through the heart of Rakka, and though the maggots swarmed and tried to reknit his flesh, he was caught. His feet moved with futility, not even touching the ground since he was suspended about five feet off the ground with the impaling branch keeping him stuck. He roared and screamed, but made no progress.\n\n“Go now!” Growlf said in my mind, his psychic voice echoing with a loud, clanging feeling throughout my entire consciousness. I winced at the power of this inner voice. “The boy has little time left! The altar is just ahead. You are our only hope.”\n\n“Well, that’s not good,” I muttered to myself. If I was the only hope for saving this forest, maybe this entire town, then they really were in a much shittier position than I had imagined.\n\nWickie and I ran forward, reloading our guns as we went. A few hundred feet ahead, we saw the flickering glow of a bonfire. A round stone table about twenty feet across sat next to it, a thin, shirtless boy tied and gagged on the top of it. Around him, cult members in black robes chanted, standing in a circle, every eye on the imprisoned boy.\n\nOnce we were within range, Wickie and I began firing, my Judge pistol blowing holes the size of a grapefruit into the chests of many of the cult members. Wickie was also a great shot, and his .22 put tiny bullet holes into the skulls of those nearest the boy, dropping them instantly. The rest of them scattered like cockroaches, the chanting stopping immediately as they ran in all directions into the forest. We took the opportunity to reload.\n\n“Let’s get this kid and get the fuck out of here!” Wickie said, and I nodded. The sooner I get out of here, the better, I thought to myself.\n\nTaking out a pocket knife, I quickly began to cut the bindings on the boy’s hands and feet, while Wickie untied the gag around his mouth. The boy had a vacant, blank look in his eyes. I wondered whether he was in shock.\n\n“Smitty, can you hear me?” I asked him loudly. He didn’t respond, just staring through me, not making eye contact.\n\n“Just grab the freaking kid and let’s go!” Wickie said. “Those other things, the ones with the long arms and the pale skin, are probably going to be back soon. You don’t really know how long the protection the bear gave you lasts, do you?”\n\n“Uh, no,” I said, trying to remember. I knew logically that it didn’t last forever, but would it wear off so fast? I figured we would find out on our way back.\n\nGrabbing Smitty’s arm, I pulled him up from the table. He didn’t resist, and when I started speed-walking back towards the trail, he kept pace with me.\n\n“Thank you,” Smitty said to me silently. I barely heard him, but looked over at him in surprise. He glanced over at me, making eye contact for the barest fractions of a second, then returned his gaze forwards. \n\n“Hey, little man, you’re welcome,” I said, smiling. “We weren’t going to let you die out here. Your dad is waiting for you, too.” I didn’t tell him his dad was probably waiting for him in the hospital, getting his head stitched up and his skull fractures checked out.\n\n“But we are in trouble, still,” Smitty said, pointing to the tree where Rakka had been impaled. Looking up, I realized the branch where I had seen him suspended was now broken in half, and there was no sign of the monster except for thick black blood and thousands of squirming maggots on the fractured remainder.\n\n“Oh shit…” Wickie and I both said at the same time, as a rushing shape smelling like burning plastic and rotting meat sprinted out of the woods, grabbing Wickie and disappearing into the pitch blackness. As he was grabbed, Wickie dropped his gun, yelling in surprise. Once he realized what was happening, he started screaming at me.\n\n“Get out of here!” he said. “Don’t worry about me! Get the kid to safety.” I tried running after him, but Rakka was far too fast. After a minute, I turned around and went back to the trail, where I saw Smitty patiently waiting.\n\n“Fuck!” I screamed. “We have to get him back!”\n\n“Don’t worry,” Smitty said, his face a blank expression. “I can track them. I can track all of them. I see it like points on a map in my…” He stopped walking, pointing to his forehead. I was panting, doubled over from sprinting, “But we need help. There are too many of them, and the mark is wearing off. I see it on you like light being washed away. Your face grows darker and darker as it fades.” This was the most I had ever heard Smitty speak, and I was flabbergasted.\n\n“We *will* come back,” I said, taking Smitty’s hand and leading him to safety. We found his father, who had been picked up by a random passerby as he stumbled in the road, his face a mask of blood, his wounds untreated, the brain damage and concussions making him totally unaware of where he was or what was going on by that point.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI finished telling all of this to my psychiatrist the next morning. He had been prescribing me antidepressants for my crippling depression, and even though Wickie was gone for now, I still had to go to work and keep my appointments. I knew I would get Wickie back eventually. He was too tough and dumb to kill. The psychiatrist nodded at me as I spoke.\n\n“Do you blame yourself for what happened to your friend, Hardwick?” he asked, pushing his glasses up his nose.\n\n“No, we did what we had to do,” I said, not knowing whether I was being totally truthful. Maybe I did blame myself a little bit, but I didn’t want to tell this man that. He wrote a few more notes in his notepad, then his secretary came in.\n\n“Dr. Firenzo?” the pretty brunette said. He looked up. “You have a call. It’s an emergency.” Nodding gravely, he got up.\n\n“Please excuse me, Jay. I’ll be right back,” he said, leaving the room and closing the door behind him.\n\nI got up after a minute, bored, wondering how long this was going to take. I looked at his notepad, laying facedown on his brown leather chair, and frowned.\n\nFlipping it over, I saw he hadn’t been taking notes at all. He had simply drawn a picture across the entire front of the notepad.\n\nIt was a picture of me, crucified to a lamppost, my eyeballs hanging out, a pentagram carved into my chest. Underneath in tiny, neat block letters, he had written, “Kill the traitor.”\n\n“Well,” I said, putting the notepad back down, “that can’t be good.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe FBI offered to send me help in finding Wickie. That day, I had a team of agents and dogs with me at the ranger station. Even Sheriff Ames showed up, saying he wanted to help in any way he could. After all, I had risked my life, I had saved the boy, but now another adventure had to begin.\n\nI just hoped I would find Wickie in time, and that one day, I would end the evil in this forest, once and for all.",

        "text": "I have many stories through my line of work, this is a series that have taken place over the course of a few years at a car dealership.  \n\nI supervise a couple of night guards for a night security shift at a high end car dealership Lexus, Porsche,BMW, Mercedes and on the  rare occasion Ferrari and Lamborghini.  This dealership has been owned by many people and now is in the hands of a group known for their racing teams.\n\nAbout this dealership during the day it’s like any other dealerships, but at night the building no longer welcomes people.\n\nThe first night I met with the operations manager that day, we went over the ropes and what was expected.  Before he left he said to never enter with the lights off.  I asked him why and he said “I don’t want you tripping on something and damaging one of my beautiful cars” fair I thought, but he was lying.\n\nNight time has come I am sitting at the front receptionist desk, getting tired of the brightness I turned off the lights. I was on my laptop playing some flash games then I hear a loud banging noise.  Immediately began to investigate.  Know keep in mind this dealership is two stories 1st is for sales second is for maintenance and repairs.  \n\nOn the 1st floor everything is how it was left, nothing out of touch.  From behind I hear someone talk and footsteps,  FOOTSTEPS! so close getting closer, I turned around shining my flashlight and the noises stopped.  I walk by the restroom and hear the toilet flush. I enter no one is there but the toilet would flush on its own, keep in mind there is a lever and no sensor.  Creepy!  I take the elevator then the bang happens again,took the stairs.\n\nOn the 2nd story I felt cold, someone was here I can feel eyes stab my skin. But no matter how hard I searched not a single person was there.  \nI left the building and my laptop inside deciding I had enough.  Now in my truck I had the overwhelming urge to sleep. I figured it was safe to do so sense my task was done and I did.  About another hour later I wake up to see someone in the tree line. It was a man in good cloths.  The man starts to sprint towards my truck, dress shoes clacking on the pavement a knife in his hands.  I jump out of the truck draw my pistol he was gone.  I decide to go back to the building.\n\nNow at the front entrance there is insane amount of tapping on the glass.  Too much to be a branch and it became cold again. I went back to the truck and moved it under the lights, no more creepy encounters.\n\nThe next night, I trained a new hire.  Almost\nForgetting about the encounters of the previous night I showed the new hire the ropes of the the property, what to do and look for.  This time with the lights on the tapping began.\n\nNow with two sets of eyes we searched the property.  Related to the story the new hire is Jewish and is very active in his religion. He comes back to me and told me “I can’t do this, the building hates me”. I laugh and say it can’t it’s a building.  He told me what happened.\n\nThe new guard was on the second floor while I was on the first.  There was footsteps but this time he felt a cold hand on his shoulder, a whisper in his ear “we don’t like your kind in our business” then he turned around and met my ghostly friend as he was fading out of existence.\n\nAfter that, we decided to blow it off and think nothing of it.  I left and went home.\n\nThe next night I call him, he told me that something kept staring at him in the wood lines and that the knocking never stopped.  He had the urge to sleep but every time our friend would wake him up.  We decided to stay in the brightest part of the parking lot after dark.  Our plan was to do all our task during the day and not enter the building at all.  The creepy encounters stopped.\n\nA year later, my friend was out of work and needed a job, I told him we had a dealership open and I’ll get him trained on it tonight.  Keep in mind I have almost completely forgot about what happened.\n\nI showed him the ropes not a sound, no tapping, no footsteps.  All was clear. For notes my friend is sleight obese.\n\nI left and waited till the next day.   I call my buddy and asked him how his first shift went.  He said it was decent but I wasn’t funny. I asked what he meant.  Then he said you think it’s funny scaring\n people do you? I laugh and told him I was happy at home in bed what’s up?  Then he told me what happened.\n\nThe shift happened like normal, but then the encounters happened.  The same as before but this time the being walked up behind him and said “hello piggy, are you hungry? I saw some donuts in the break room, would the piggy want to eat?” He looked behind our mysterious friend was no where to be seen.  Throughout the night the footsteps would grow closer and it would say “piggy I know you can hear me! The piggy wants to eat doesn’t he?” My buddy went to his truck and found the brightest spot in the parking lot, no more.\n\nThe once new hire decided to place a few crosses hidden around the first floor so we can use the restroom in peace, it worked.  Now when we enter the property no more footsteps, tapping or weird voices.  We learned to never look at the building or even acknowledge the being after dark. If you look hard enough you can still see the being angrily stare from the second floor, trapped until someone moves our protections.",

She hadn’t wanted a wake, hadn’t wanted a repast. Just a Christian funeral and burial in consecrated ground, one last means of protection against the supernatural beings that had plagued her during her life. The emptiness of the church stung me. Just me and a few local Greek ladies with whom she liked to bake occasionally.  *To do this job is to be alone*.  Alone.  Martina had worn it as a badge of honor.  But then again, I think she had to have been one of the bravest people in the world.\n\nI’m not brave.  That’s why I’m back again, posting here. I don’t think I have it in me to be alone.  I think—no, I *know*—that I can’t face it.  I know it’s a cliche, but I am empty inside, so tired and so sick of grief. *Don’t let yourself be alone*, the spirits in Cottage 14 had said. Was it a warning? Or a prophecy? \n\nI don’t care if my cottage is about to fall down around me; I haven’t been back to Cottage 7 since the police left that horrible night. I hated lying as the paramedics took her away, hated forcing myself to say a bear attacked us, inventing some story that the campground down the street had a litter problem. They checked me for a concussion. I refused a trip to the hospital. There was no sign of the thing that had attacked us.\n\nAt first, I was angry, the kind of anger that permeates through the entire body. I was paralyzed by it, wondering *why*, turning over in my head the utter injustice of it. *It wasn’t in the notebook.* *It was supposed to be safe*. *Why? Why? WHY?* I know. The world is unfair. Hardly breaking news. *It wasn’t supposed to be like this.* \n\nI haven’t been back in the office, frozen as she left it with all her supplies that were carefully chosen in 1975. Most of the time I sit for hours on my couch, wrapped in her favorite cat blanket, bringing the cigarette-infused fleece to my face. When I close my eyes, I see her there, dead and bloody. I see my dad in his coffin after the embalmer cleaned him up. People shaking our hands saying how sorry they were, how great he was, whatever. I hated it at the time. But I wish someone did that for Martina. I had wanted to say a few words before the service, but Martina had specified in a hand written codicil to her will (in all capital letters) “NO EULOGIES.” She hated a fuss.\n\nIt was my fault. It had to have been. Not just the fact that I had made the flippant decision to reach out to touch that body. As Martina herself said, things around here were shifting, changing and not for the better. And the only thing different was me. I had to be the catalyst. The only thing keeping me from wallowing in self-loathing was the fact that Martina would hate it. *Damn waste of time*, she would say before suggesting we got on with the job. So I tried. I tried to eat, take a shower, walk around, I really did. But ultimately, I just found myself just back on the couch.\n\nMy favorite time of day is now the time I take to carefully consult Martina’s notebook. I trace my finger over her no-nonsense handwriting, written with her favorite blue ballpoint pen. I make sure that her meticulously drafted payment schedule is still current, trying not to smudge the ink with my tears. \n\nToday was the first day I had to do a payment without her.\n\n*Number 4*\n\n*Tin box of animal bones.* *Place at center of table.* *Attend the séance.* *Talking okay.* *Arrive promptly at 10:00pm.* *Don’t stay past midnight.*\n\n*Payment schedule: Monthly*\n\n“That’s a new one,” I muttered to myself. “Seems a bit redundant for a supernatural entity to conduct a séance, but I guess I’ll see.” Truthfully, the idea intrigued me, in a macabre way. After all, there were plenty of dead people in my life that I would give anything to talk to one last time. \n\nI had never attended a séance out in the real world. They seemed on the one hand to be unspeakably hokey and on the other hand absurdly dangerous. I tend to agree with my Catholic upbringing that calling out to spirits doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to summon something nice on the other side. At this point, however, I was certain that whatever would be doing the summoning and whatever was being summoned would be unpleasant.\n\nMy phone said it was six o’ clock in the evening. The sun had already set. I took a mental inventory of what I had consumed so far that day. Coffee, water, a few slices of toast.  I thought it would be wise to fortify myself more if I was in for another long night. Unfortunately, my refrigerator was quite bare, but I did manage to collect ingredients for a sandwich that made me feel slightly more human upon consumption. \n\nThere had been a rusty tin box in the basement, I remembered. I conspicuously used the exterior bulkhead entrance to avoid the motel office. I found it in the corner next to the utility sink and gave it a shake, grateful to hear the rattling of bones inside. *One less thing to gather.* I opened it; there were bones of all different sizes and provenance. I assumed it was some assortment of chicken, turkey, and deer. The box itself was probably as old as the cottages, with some flecks of red paint advertising a product with a name long since faded away.\n\nStill with plenty of time to kill before 10, I gathered the box of bones and made my way to my favorite spot on the property. The cottages sit on a soft lawn of grass interspersed with some flowers and bushes that have been sadly neglected. (It’s on my to-do list.) Towards the river, that grass gives way to sloping glacial rocks and the bank with its dock. Right at the edge of the grass is a wrought iron bench installed by my great-grandfather as an anniversary gift to my great-grandmother, the final, crowning detail of their beloved cottage park. I wondered how their dream became infested with so many nightmares.\n\nIn the summer, the bench is a prime location for boat watching, from the smallest kayaks and power boats to the to the massive tankers and container ships sailing down the river and locks to the Great Lakes. This time of year, the locks are closed and few dare a boat trip when the river is mostly filled with moving chunks of ice. Except, of course, our desperate guest who had the misfortune to check in on tax day. The man’s boat was still tied up at the dock, bobbing empty. He probably thought he had been lucky navigating the ice with success. Little did he know he was already damned.\n\nAt ten o’clock I was at the door of Cottage 4, which dramatically opened despite there being no one visible inside. With a sigh I stepped in and the door predictably flew shut behind me. I gagged, the interior smelled like mothballs and dusty fabric with the undertones of a sickly-sweet floral perfume. The same table and chairs present in every cottage were in the center of the room. Encircling the seating area were unlit candles, hundreds and hundreds of candles of varying heights with pendulous rivers of wax fusing them together into an imposing mass. The interior shutters of the windows were tightly closed, snuffing out the meager moonlight. \n\nI carefully stepped over the candles and sat in a chair, placing the tin box in the center as the notebook instructed. The candles erupted into flame and the temperature in the room plummeted.  The animal bones began to rustle, flinching into the air then clattering back down, the tempo gradually increasing, bones knocking against each other more violently. Rapping sounds began under the table, joining the clattering bones in a cacophonous rhythm.\n\nA force pulled my hands away from my sides and on to the table. A searing pain pierced my wrists. To my horror, skeletal hands with elongated and sharpened finger tips were holding me, drawing blood. The owners of these hands soon materialized.\n\nThey were three women dressed in black hoop skirts draped in crepe with decrepit lace sleeves, black hair parted down the middle and swept back into a chignon, with the exception of the woman directly across from me whose black hair hung in long black braids. Though the hands they held around the table were nothing but bones, their faces appeared to be an approximation of a living human’s face with thick black veins snaking across their corpse-hued skin. They each grinned at me exposing black teeth and tongues. Their eyes were equally ghoulish—completely white as though permanently rolled back in their heads. \n\nThe rapping increased, as though multiple entities were knocking on the wooden table. The women cocked their heads at me, as though conducting an examination, grins somehow getting wider.\n\n“Girl, new girl,” the woman to my right hissed. The voice sounded as though echoing from underwater, with a disconcerting delay between the movement of the thin black lips and the arrival of the muffled sound. “Girl, would you seek communion with beyond? Will you join the circle?” The three leaned forward, eager for my answer.\n\n“I would,” I said, trying to sound resolute. *Not like I have a choice.*\n\n“So sweet and young. Pretty. So nice and new,” said the woman with the braids. \n\n“Welcome, welcome,” the woman on my left whispered. “We are the sisters Kane. I am Margery. There is Margaretta,” the woman to my right nodded.  “And Mina, the youngest.” The three cackled.\n\n“Uhhh, hello. My name is Nora.”\n\nMore laughter. The sisters threw their heads back in ecstasy. \n\n“Oh great spirits of the celestial ether, come join us beyond the veil!”  Margaretta moaned. “We feel your presence, yes, yes, we hear your knock. The rapping increased to almost a frenzied pace. “Come, come, we welcome you!” \n\nThe women began to levitate, rising from the ground, bringing me with them while not breaking the circle. Peeking underneath their wide hoops were skeletal feet, bones cracking together creating the agitated rapping.\n\n“The spirits are here! They’re here!” Margery cried.\n\nWith a sudden thud, we plummeted back to our seats. I groaned with the impact. The sisters slumped in the chairs and the rapping ceased. A momentary silence descended over us and I was grateful to be released from the din. The relief was short-lived. An icy breeze caressed the back of my neck. \n\nMargery gasped as though all the air had been drawn out of her lungs (if she had any). She turned her head towards me with that awful grin.\n\n“Hey there, honey.” My father’s voice sounded from her lips. “Nora. I miss you so much.”\n\nOf course, it had been the deepest desire of my heart to hear him again. To have them say those precise words. But if there’s anything that I had learned, if there was anything that Martina had taught me, was that things were not always what they seemed. I didn’t trust these entities. I didn’t trust this thing grinning at me, my father’s voice escaping from her blackened teeth. And it made me mad. If they had not been physically pinning my hands to the table, I think I would have slapped her. \n\n“You’re not my father,” I said, gritting my teeth. \n\n“Nora, it’s me. Don’t you recognize your own father?”\n\n“If you’re my dad, tell me what I was for Halloween when I was five.”\n\nMargery’s grin faltered for a moment.\n\n“I don’t remember. But I do remember how much I love you.”\n\n“That’s a lie. My dad loved Halloween. He’d help me plan my costume months in advance, take me trick or treating…” I trailed off, unable to wipe the tears from my eyes. Hearing his voice again, in this way. It was unbearable. \n\nMargery’s face fell, the grin now gone.\n\n“You hateful child,” she growled.  “You have no respect for the sacred gift of channeling.”\n\nMargaretta laughed. “More intriguing than the last one, she is. Better than that old hag.”\n\nMargery nodded; enthusiastic grin replenished. “That old one. Arguing with her mother in Greek for the entire session!”\n\nMagaretta gasped and dug her nails in deeper. “Another spirit approaches!” She croaked. She threw her head back and this time my Uncle Jim’s voice escaped her lips.\n\n“Nora. I’m so sorry. So sorry about everything. I should have never left all of this to you. You’re not ready. You’re too young.”\n\n“Okay, if you’re my uncle Jim, what did you buy me for my sixteenth birthday?”\n\n“The gift of your dreams!”\n\n“Not really. It was neat, though. Tell me what it was.”\n\n“I would rather say how much I love and miss you.”\n\n“Liar!” I shouted, rattling the table and its box of bones.\n\nMargaretta’s face twisted into something hostile.\n\n“You do not honor the dead, foolish girl. Perhaps, once you become one of us, you will understand.” \n\n“Yes, yes, let’s teach her!” Margery cried. They leaned towards me menacingly.\n\nA great cry erupted out of Mina, who until this moment had still been slumped over across from me. She began to choke as if something were trying to escape her. The other sisters’ dead eyes widened with alarm. \n\n“Enough with this racket!” A familiar scratchy voice shouted. My heart leapt.\n\n“Martina!”\n\n“Listen, kid. I don’t have much time.” \n\n“What is this! What is this! Begone spirit!” Margery wailed.\n\n“Shut up, you fraudster!” Martina yelled.\n\nMargery gasped at the insolence. Mina swung her head back to me, just as astonished as her sisters at the voice coming from her throat. It was obvious this was not another attempt at mimicry.\n\n“Listen, Nora. First, enough of this moping around. I’m dead. It’s okay. Had to happen sometime. I’m fine. More than fine, actually. I understand things now. And I need to tell you. You’re in danger. I know, news of the week. But there’s something here that is running the show and it isn’t you.” \n\nMargery and Margaretta began to wail, their terrible muffled voices keening in anger. \n\n“Silence! Silence!”\n\nMina shook her head, braids flapping in agitation, desperately trying to keep her mouth shut. But Martina’s voice pried its way through.\n\n“It’s old and powerful and full of hate. She wants to destroy you.”\n\n“Martina, I can’t do this without you. I can’t do this alone!”\n\n“Quit your blatting! It’s time to toughen up. She’s a nasty piece of work and she’s coming. Very soon.”\n\n“How dare you speak of the mistress!” Margaretta shrieked. She tore her claws out of my arm, broke the circle, and lunged at Mina. Margery did the same. They wrapped their bone hands around her neck and shook. \n\n“Nora!” Martina’s voice rasped. “It’s midnight!”\n\nI jumped up, cradling my bleeding wrists, remembering the notebook entry. *Don’t stay past midnight.* The sisters’ heads turned towards me in mechanical unison. The grins were back. They laughed. I scrambled towards the door, stumbling on the ring of candles. They leapt towards me, Margery sinking her claws into my foot, pulling me backwards. I held fast to the doorknob, pulling myself forward with all my might. With my free foot I swung wildly, kicking the spectral hand holding me. I mentally thanked Martina for the steel toe boots she had gotten me for my last birthday. Margery yelped and hissed, releasing my foot. \n\nI dove out of the front door and scrambled off the rotting porch before collapsing onto the brittle, frozen grass, chest heaving. The wailing inside the cottage continued, rising to a primordial roar, beyond the sound of human or animal. And then it ceased in an instant, as though someone had pulled the plug.\n\nI limped back to my cottage and examined my wounds. Luckily, they weren’t anything that needed further attention. I washed them carefully and wrapped them in bandages. My heart was still pounding; I was sure that once the adrenaline drained off I’d be a lot more sore. \n\nI went to the dresser in my bedroom and opened the top drawer. Pushing aside my underwear, I lifted out the real gift my uncle had gotten me for my sixteenth birthday, a beautiful Bowie knife. My parents had thought it was a gag—as I’ve said here before I was hardly an outdoorswoman. Uncle Jim had laughed along, but I knew he meant it sincerely. I know now that this must have been his way of preparing me, warning me. I was the only kid in my family, but at the time I never thought about death or inheritance.\n\nNow both were staring me in the face. I gripped the handle of the knife and thought of those I had lost. My dad and my uncle. Martina. *Toughen up*. Perhaps one day there will be a time to properly grieve.  I moved the knife from my bedroom to the front of the cottage, placing it in the drawer of a side table next to the couch.\n\nThe notebook had once defined the code of conduct between the entities and their caretaker. Follow the notebook and no one gets hurt. Now all bets were off. Was I ready to face this future alone? Absolutely not. But I had to. Somehow, I had to.\n\nSurprisingly, I fell asleep quicky and without conflict that night. By the time I awoke the next day, the sun was already setting. I was horrified, but also strangely refreshed. Sometimes our bodies take what they truly need, I guess. I treated myself to a long, hot shower, put on clean clothes and then forced myself into the kitchen.\n\nUnfortunately, sixteen hours of sleep hadn’t replenished my empty fridge. I found a block of cheddar and began to cut it up. Halfway through my task, something caught my eye. I put the cheese down and stood at my sink, looking out the window.\n\nThere was a light on in Cottage 7.\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

        "text": "I can't stop thinking of something I heard earlier. I like to think I have pretty thick skin I don’t really get upset or offended by anything but sometimes there can be something that genuinely will creep me out. \n\nIn recent years I have gotten a newfound love for creepy pastas and internet horror stories. Ill often times listen to youtube videos of people narrating stories from reddit or other blog sites just because I like the suspense of it all. I find it oddly relaxing. One of the things about creepy pastas that attracts me to them so much is that in all of my favorite ones (like the backrooms or sirenheads or ben drowned) there is always some layer of realism to them. They are fictional made up stories but still allow for some level of believability. The thought of ‘what if this was real’. I like the uncertainty and mystery of not knowing. \n\nI’ve also delved a little bit into true crime and nsfl content. Stuff that no normal person should have to see. But im not normal. So. Things like this include videos like ISIS executions, cartel executions, live suicides, etc. I have seen the infamous 3 guys one hammer video which was a murder that took place in Ukraine where 2 teenage boys beat to death an old man with a hammer and recorded it on a cell phone and it is extremely graphic. \n\nI say all this because it leads into what happened this morning. It somewhat involves my job. I currently work in the pickup department at my local grocery store. We just had our space moved from the front to the back corner of our building. We have a bit of a light forest area behind our store. There’s a short cement/brick wall and up that hill behind the wall is where the woods start. Woods and forest areas are no stranger to horror stories so you can probably tell where this is going.\n\nIt’s a pretty normal day. Colder than usual it’s cloudy and rainy but nothing im not used to. Im just outside dealing with a customer loading her car like normal and then it happens. Something that hours later I can’t stop thinking about because it genuinely made me uncomfortable enough to remember it.\n\nIm just loading this ladys car and out of nowhere I hear the sound of a woman screaming at the top of her lungs. I stop and look up and am able to deduce that the direction of the screaming is coming from the forest area beyond our little wall. I don’t say anything or acknowledge it because I didn’t wanna start anything but as I continued to load her car I kept my ears focused on what I thought was desperate screaming. In my own imagination it sounded like someone yelling for help as they were being attacked or assaulted. I couldn’t make out any words though because there was also the sound of trucks and machinery going on so the voice was a bit muffled. \n\nThis goes on for what feels like a good 2 minutes. The gasp for air between each wail getting more frequent until she eventually slows down and comes to a stop. It was a gradual decline into silence. I cant say Ive heard anything like this ever before. Not in real life. That was the most messed up thing about this. It actually felt real. The screaming felt like it was coming from a place of real fear and desparation. It felt so real that even now hours past I still cant stop thinking about it.\n\nI don’t know what happened. Part of me wants to believe my mind was just playing tricks on me. But what if it wasn’t. What if what I imagined wasn’t imaginary at all. What if I really just witnessed a sexual assault occur within earshot. And I just stood by in confusion and uncertainty. I don’t know what I would have done if I knew for sure what was going on if anything at all. That’s really why I didn’t wanna talk about it. I didn’t wanna start any kind of incident without knowing exactly what had happened. \n\nStill a mystery to me. Im not sure if what I heard was real or not. But it definitely was unlike anything Ive experienced before. Hopefully this will just go away and I can stop thinking about it. And that it really was my imagination and me being overly paranoid and cynical.",

        "text": "If you came to me with a button that gave Derrick his sight back, I wouldn’t press it and neither would he. Not in a million years. Our lives are way too perfect and cute as is, honestly.\n\nFor example, we have this game where I creep up on him like some sort of predator. Derrick could hear a penny drop from across a crowded bar, so whenever I’m stalking him, the slightest floorboard creak makes his ears perk up. Then he’ll crane his neck to the side and say, “Morning Charlotte.”\n\nI still get the better of him, though. Now and again, I’ll go full stealth mode and slip my hands around his waist from behind, a little surprise-attack hug. Then he always pretend sulks for a minute or so before kissing me. It’s adorable.\n\nThere’s also the fringe benefits—like not needing to dress up. Not gonna go into detail, but my toxic ex liked making a big stink about that. He said he made the effort so I should too. Never mind the fact that, for him, ‘getting ready’ meant ‘a quick glance in the mirror’.\n\nYou can imagine how much it bugged me. But now, theres times I don’t even bother with an outfit at all. It's bliss.\n\nThe only downside—and you’re putting a gun against my head here—is Derrick’s a light sleeper. Every minute sound keeps him awake. If Mr. and Mrs. Mumble over in number 12 get into a late-night squabble, he sits up and listens to one of his audiobooks until they gas themselves out.\n\nThat said, there's times having a spouse with a built-in alarm system comes in useful. Like last night.\n\nWe’d gone to bed after a spirited round of ‘Marco Polo’ ended with us in bed, as usual. Not long after midnight, Derrick sat bolt upright and said, “Someone's outside.”\n\nI kicked on my slippers, shuffled over to the window, and pulled back the curtain. Beneath me, the kitchen window banged lightly in the breeze.\n\n“It’s nothing, honey. I left the window open. Go back to sleep.”\n\n“No. There’s a burglar downstairs. I can hear…clicks.”\n\nWhile Derrick fumbled for the baseball bat stashed under the bed, I swallowed a gulp and said. “Why don't you wait here while I—\"\n\n“Fuck that. I’m about to go all Daredevil on this asshole.”\n\nA wave of black panic rushed over me. Seeing no other choice, I moulted out of my human disguise. The discarded skin suit flopped onto the floor, then, in a movement so swift Derrick wouldn’t have seen it if he *could* see, my stinger shot forward like a dart, penetrating his stomach.\n\nThe muscles in my legs—all eight of them—twanged wildly. Not good.\n\nThe toxins didn’t immediately take hold. Instead, my husband gulped the air like a drowning man while my upper limbs closed around him in an intimate embrace.\n\n“Don’t worry, Char,” he said lazily, quivering as I lay him flat along the bed. “I’ll protect you.” A runner of drool leaked from the corner of his mouth.\n\n“I know honey. I know.”\n\nUnencumbered by my disguise, I raced toward the outer landing, scuttled across the wall beside the stairs, over the ceiling, soundlessly travelling with sequential contractions of my limbs. Downstairs, a sickening stench of dead bugs wafted out from the kitchen. My nausea cranked up a notch.\n\nFirst the toxin didn't kick in immediately, now this. What the hell was going on?\n\nI slipped through the door. Up ahead, in the darkness, a tall blonde man leaned against the centre island drinking from a cup of coffee. “Charlotte,” he nodded, eyes gleaming in the gloom.\n\n“Ryan.”\n\n“You’re looking monstrous as ever.”\n\n“What are you doing here?” My voice sounded thin and uncertain. Scared.\n\n“Heard you got married. Thought I’d pop by and say congratulations. I would have sent a letter, but, you know, you ghosted me.”\n\n“That’s…sweet.”\n\nHe smirked. I circled the outer edge of the room, each limb striking the tiled floor in succession.\n\n“So, does he know?” Ryan asked, nodding at a wedding picture mounted against the sidewall.\n\n“Know what?”\n\nAir hissed through his thin lips, a series of rapid clicks. “Oh, you know, about those funny little quirks of yours. The way you hog the bedsheets. Or how you binge-watch that dumb reality show.”\n\n“Love island.”\n\n“Yeah, Love Island. And there was one more thing, what was it again?” He pretended to concentrate. “Oh yeah, that you’re secretly a giant Spider-monster? Did you drop *that* bombshell on the poor bastard yet?”\n\n“You know, it never came up.” Fighting the dry cramp seizing my throat, I said, “Why are you *really* here?”\n\n“You wound me, Char. I honestly just stopped by to say congrats. And there’s no hard feelings about how things ended.”\n\n“Fantastic. You can leave the same way you arrived.”\n\nWith a casual expression, he finished his coffee, tossed the empty mug into the sink, and started in the direction of the window.\n\nHe paused, his back to me. “Although. I did travel a long way to get here. And I am absolutely famished.”\n\nMy insides squirmed.\n\n“Maybe I’ll grab a quick snack? Like a chunk of your visually impaired boytoy? What do you think he would miss less, an arm or a leg?”\n\nFrom across the room, he opened his mouth and let out a series of rapid clicks. Kerds of foam splashed across my face as we stood there, motionless. A showdown.\n\n“No preference? Let’s go arm, then. And for dessert, I’ll suck out his eye jelly. He doesn't need it.”\n\nI flew at him, enraged. In the split second it took me to cross the room, Ryan’s body elongated hideously, the spine splitting into segments. From invisible slits along his forearms, razor-sharp, green appendages flicked out like switch-blades while mandibles extended through his mouth like a blooming flower. Within seconds, his ‘face’ became a rubber Halloween mask stretched taut over a skull two sizes too big.\n\nBefore, that effortless transformation irritated me. Now, I was terrified.\n\nThose forelegs sliced the air once, twice. At the very last second, I dodged by leaping onto the ceiling with a flex of my legs.\n\nRyan looked up, eyes as yellow as candle flames, before charging into the hall, mandibles clicking away. I raced after him, still upside down.\n\nAn awful bolt of terror struck me as I pictured Ryan killing me, then leaving the body for Derrick to uncover. My fear and rage cranked up a notch. I needed to move, fast.\n\nAs the creature started toward the stairs, I flexed the muscles in my underside. Nothing happened. What an awful time for a block.\n\nI tensed my entire body. Soon, spools of web shot forward like party streamers, coating Ryan’s legs. Those webs stretched out, elongating, as he scurried past the top step, only to get yanked back into the downstairs landing as if pulled by a bungee cord.\n\nThe bastard crashed against the side table with a heavy thud. A porcelain lamp fell to the ground and shattered while landscape paintings slid off the walls.\n\nAfter righting himself, Ryan slashed through the webbing, which bought me enough time to move into position and let my stinger swing down.\n\nAware of what was happening, he stabbed upward at my midsection. The spines pierced my exoskeleton, but he couldn't yank them loose because the barbs became tangled with my insides. This left my stinger free to penetrate his thorax, again and again. Ten injections made his body go limp.\n\nI’d only planned on pumping him full of toxins, but then my muscles suddenly contracted. A loud cry forced its way through my throat, one so loud a conscious Derrick would have heard it from miles away.\n\nThere came this intense, tingly sensation. And then my entire world came crashing down…\n\n\\-\n\nThe next morning, Derrick wandered into the kitchen, later than usual. I kept one hand against my bandaged midsection as he grabbed two headache tablets from the cabinet.\n\n“I think I’m coming down with something,” he said as he filled a glass of water, his voice tired and groggy.\n\nEven without me uttering a single word, his head perked up. “Is everything okay? You’re shaking.” Quickly he crossed the room, covered my cheek with fierce little kisses.\n\nAbove our heads, Ryan’s corpse lay cocooned inside a web.\n\n“What’s that sound?” Derrick asked.\n\nI glanced up. The portion of webbing covering the thorax went up and down, pulsating rhythmically. Less than six hours after our encounter, and it had—almost—reached bursting point. This put me in a difficult position.\n\nAfter finishing my coffee, I took a deep breath, laced my hands with Derrick’s, and sighed. “So, you know how we [always talked about having kids?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",
