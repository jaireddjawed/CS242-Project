But this is a highly individual punishment whereas what Gunny was talking about sounded universally applicable.\n\nI would’ve asked him this question, but it was one of those rough days where everyone just wanted to get home as soon as possible.

As he puts it:\n\nFollowing the Fiscal Crisis the banks had loaned millions to the city to compensate for the lack of tax money. The city began to worry about the debt and set up a meeting hoping to sell bonds. Despite being invited and asked to arrive at 11am, the banks didn't show up.\n\nThey rescheduled for 2pm and the banks promised they would arrive... but again they didn't. They never did - and after the President refused to bail the city out the Banks argued that they should take a role in the management of the city in order to protect their loans - leading to a new committee being set up to handle the cities debt made up of 9 people. 8 of them being bankers. The event marked a radical shift in power and the execution of the emergent idea that financial systems could run society.\n\nAre there any events like this 'Meeting' in the same vain? Seemingly insignificant from a day to day perspective but hugely significant for the compounding effects they have historically? Preferably recorded historical events. Not 'the guy who accidently made soup for the first time'. I imagine many of the responses will be 'takes'. Its a difficult thing to gauge and I imagine it may come to down personal opinion regarding the nuances of these events.",

Also, how plausible is some kind of civilization close to the early Sumerians in scope (population/agriculture/social complexity) pre-ice age? Finally, could writing have been developed pre-ice age and been lost to time (potentially due to not needing a transactional system with a smaller agricultural and pastoral scope during the ice age) or is it likely writing would have persisted through this time period due to its utility?\nApologies if this has been asked elsewhere or is too hypothetical with insufficient evidence.",

        "text": "My mother has no Ashkenazi or Jewish roots as far as we know. But a really high proportion of the slang she uses comes from Yiddish. I once pointed out the etymology of a word she had used and it seems like she had no idea that it came from Yiddish and was only very vaguely aware that the language even exists or where it comes from. (I think she just likes the way it sounds.) I'm talking about words like *schmaltz*, *schlep*, *schmutz*, *tuches*, *klutz*, *bupkis*, etc.\n\nFor context, she is a white woman born in the 1950s who grew up in a rural part of the Midwestern US, where there isn't a big Ashkenazi Jewish population at all. Her parents were the same, but the generations before that were mostly Christian immigrants from Northern/Western Europe.\n\nWas there just a lot of Yiddish slang in boomer pop culture, such that it became part of the general lexicon of the US? When did Yiddish phrases start to catch on among the rest of the US or English-speaking population?",

Monmouth was born nine months after Walter and Charles II first met, and was acknowledged as his son by Charles II, but James II suggested that he was the son of another of her lovers, Colonel Robert Sidney, rather than Charles. **(Also see: \"The Monmouth Rebellion\", in which James tried to seize the throne by force after the death of Charles II.)** Lucy Walter had a daughter, Mary Crofts, born after James in 1651, but Charles II was not the father, since he and Walter parted in September 1649.\n\nBy Elizabeth Killigrew (1622–1680), daughter of Sir Robert Killigrew, who married Francis Boyle, 1st Viscount Shannon, in 1660:\n\n* Charlotte Jemima Henrietta Maria FitzRoy (1650–1684), married firstly James Howard, and secondly William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth\n\nBy Catherine Pegge, daughter of Thomas Pegge, a Royalist soldier, and his wife, Catherine Kniveton, daughter of Sir Gilbert Kniveton, Baronet:\n\n* Charles FitzCharles (1657–1680), known as \"Don Carlo\", created **Earl of Plymouth** (1675)\n* Catherine FitzCharles (born 1658; she either died young or became a nun at Dunkirk)\n\nBy Barbara Villiers (1641–1709), only child of only child of William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison, and wife of Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine, created Duchess of Cleveland in her own right:\n\n* Lady Anne Palmer (Fitzroy) (1661–1722), married Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex.

Christabella served as Charles II's wet nurse from his birth, and later became Charles's first mistress when the prince was 14.

But I also read that the black book of communism's methodology had been questioned. \n\nSo my question is what is the most rigorous estimate of the number of excess deaths under communist regimes in the 20th century ?\n\nMore specifically, if you have rigorous research papers addressing the question I would be glad if you linked them. I prefer estimates using a Bayesian methodology if you have any, but if you don't know of any you can just refer to the most rigorous estimate you have !",

        "text": "How would historians respond to scholars like Gary Clayton Anderson who deny that American Indians were victims of genocide? In a 2016 article, he writes:\n\n&gt;In conclusion, forced deportation, sometimes resulting from warfare, and the diminishment and confinement of Indians on reservations are clear violations of current international law, but such policies also prevented genocide. Later policies of allotment and assimilation might also be condemned under current international law but contained no intent to kill Indians. While some historians would like to label such policies, or even individual attacks on Indian villages, as genocide, to do so requires an extremely liberal definition of that term. **Certainly, assessing the overall four-hundred year relationship between Indians and whites in America can lead to the conclusion  that the series of events defining that relationship meets the current legalistic definitions found in articles 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute—when considered together— what is commonly called ethnic cleansing. It is a far more applicable term to define the acts and policies perpetrated on Indians. While such a definition puts these actions into a modern definitional framework, it is one that is more accurate than the blanket, catchall damnation of genocide.** Yet accepting this more recent definition should never excuse the nation from culpability when it comes to Indian policies by virtue of denying claims of systematic state-sponsored genocide.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Future historians will determine the outcome of this debate. **Those who have adopted the term genocide to define crimes against Indians must admit that those crimes hardly resemble the “planned killing” that went on for months and years in Turkey in 1915–1916, in Germany in 1939–1945, in Cambodia in 1975–1978, and in Rwanda in 1994–1995. Their argument must be buoyed on the revisionist definition of the 1948 Global Conference on Genocide, admittedly used by many current scholars working on topics in the Balkans, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.** Nevertheless, it should be considered that the International Criminal Court will make the final decision on what charges to bring against perpetrators of crimes in these regions of the world, where the court is very active in prosecuting criminals. And there is no question that the court today tends to rely heavily on articles 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute, not article 6. \n\n — Anderson, G. C.

Rap, heavy metal and punk also experienced a boost in popularity. All of these genres are associated with counterculture and darker, more controversial themes.\n\n\nSimilar trend is present in television. The Simpsons, although now considered fairly tame, was quite controversial at the time for featuring more edgy characters and storylines. South Park premiered in 1997, and in 1999 we got Family guy, two shows which became popular due to their dark and edgy humor.\n\n\n90s were also the peak of emo and skater subcultures, as well as other similar subcultures focused on rejecting mainstream cultural norms and embracing more edgy identity.\n\n\n\n90s were essentially the time when counterculture became mainstream culture.

Here's the quote:\n\n&gt;\"\\[Name's\\] familiar voice was heard announcing, filling in the odd corners with ready wit, although his remark about \"having a loaf in Vienna\" was unpardonable.\"\n\nThe context is students from a prestigous university in Sydney broadcasting on a local government radio station for their annual festival. The person announcing has been a part of the previous broadcasts. The item was broadcast in May 1936. The location is Sydney, NSW, Australia. The person writing the review is a student for a student newspaper.\n\nI assume this has something to do with WWII, but I can't figure out the actual content of the \"joke\" and why it was \"unpardonable\".",
