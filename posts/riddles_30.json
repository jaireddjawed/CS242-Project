For years they lived without bothering each other but one day the dragon has decided he's had enough. He tells the warrior that there is not longer enough room on the island for both of them and they must have a battle to determine who lives and who dies.\n\nThe lay out of the island is such. There are 9 wells labelled 1-9. The man can access the first 8 wells but the 9th is behind a mountain which he can not scale. The dragon however can fly above the mountain to reach the 9th well. \n\nThese are not normal wells. They are filled with poison. The only antidote to each poison is drinking the poison from a well that is a higher tier than the last. You have 30 minutes from consuming the poison to get an antidote.\n\n(E.x: if you drink water from the 6th well, only water from the 7th, 8th or 9th well will counteract it.) \n\nThe battle is such. Both the dragon and warrior will fill a bottle with water and trade bottles to drink. \n\nThe end results are the warrior lives and the dragon dies. What happened? \n\nBoth the dragon and the warrior know the layout of the entire island and the way the water in the wells work. ",

He owned a large amount of business in the village but he was not a kind man. It was in there that he was found dead, bludgeoned by a blunt object yet no weapon was ever discovered. \nChief constable Evans was originally assigned to the case yet after years it still remains a mystery. He recalled the facts to himself.\nSmythe was found in his study, he died of concussion and there was a large bruise on his forehead. The only people at the cottage with him was Jeeves the butler and Mr Potts the gardener. Jeeves had been the prime suspect  yet no matter where they looked in the house or outside the grounds they could not find the weapon used upon him. \nHe remembered Jeeves serving up a leg of lamb which Mr Potts had begun to tuck into when he arrived. He also remembered how good it was, a guilty pleasure for Chief constable Evans was lamb. His divorce had left the bitter taste of single man life and no such home cooked meals...\nHe was thinking off topic, what were there statements again?\n\nJeeves: “Mr Smythe simply arrived at his own destination. Heavens knows how unpopular he is in the village. Even the Reverend had politely asked him to leave the church because of his foul attitude. Lord knows how he always talked down to me. Anyway I found him in the study just before dinner was served. I called for help and young Mr Potts came rushing in. That’s when we telephoned you.”\n\nMr Potts: “Yeah I remember ol’ Jeevsey getting really worked up. I was in the vegetable patch here keepin Mr Smythes radishes and beetroot growing nicely. I never saw no one run back out the house or heard anyone as far as I can remember. In fact I was that into me veggies I only remember Jeevsey walking back into the house from the butchers with that nice juicy meat. ‘Course it were frozen mind. He had reserved it especially for that Sunday’s dinner. In fact Mr Smythe came back into the house early that morning as he had a fallout or summat with the ol’ vic at the church.”\n\nEvans sat in his chair chewing on his pipe mulling it all over. He swore that Jeeves looked so daringly smug through his statement. But with no evidence of any weapon on the premises there was nothing to go on at all. \n\n\nHow was Marcus Smythe murdered?\n\n*Bonus points*\n\nWhat did Chief constable Evans miss during his original investigation? \nThis is an abridged version of another story (one from many years ago) what source is the idea from?\n\n\n\n",

There was a crowd of 5 people who all looked over at them. In the far corner was the black cloak and mask. \n\n“Who was it?” Demanded Jeff\n\nNo one answered they all looked from one to another except Lucy who was silently crying. \n\nThe group started to mutter between themselves. There was Gary by the left wall, Jim stood behind Lucy, Michael by the desk and Graham who was sat next to Gary.\n\nSuddenly Daniel caught a telling look from Lucy as she subtly nodded and stared over Daniels shoulder. He spun round quickly to see what she was looking at. She seemed to be looking through the mirrored glass. Maybe he had left the room before they arrived... impossible they saw the door as they heard the screams. He looked again and saw that Lucy was just looking at herself in the glass still crying.\n\nThen he knew who was the hooded figure.\n\nWho was it?",

        "text": "Kelsey’s parents had died in a car crash leaving her to live with her aunt and uncle. She felt a burden towards them, especially as she had an illness. But her uncle and her had always been close as he had often taken her on outings. Her aunt however was more polite towards her than anything. \nOne day her uncle went for an all day fishing trip leaving Kelsey and her aunt at home alone. He was in an area where signal for his phone was bad. Suddenly he received a phone call from Kelsey but the signal was very poor. This is what he heard.\n\n“...uncle it’s Kels... the fridge is empty I... help...”\n\nHe tried talking to her but it was no good and the call ended abruptly. He attempted several times to call back but could not get through. He quickly ran to his car and drove home as fast as he could. \nAn hour later he arrived to his home to see a police car outside. As he went in he saw auntie sobbing and being consoled by one of the officers. Another officer came to uncle and told him what had happened.\n\n“We has a report of a car going out of control at the cliff top road that heads into town from here. It’s your nieces car and I’m sorry to say we have recovered her body. She seems to have driven recklessly and that’s what caused her to lose control.”\n\nUncle thought about the call and went inside to the kitchen. He looked around and saw nothing instantly unusual. He had seen the dinner auntie had prepared which seemed to be hunters chicken. There was a big bowl of bbq sauce left on the table and an empty bottle of honey. He went to the fridge and looked inside. There was the usual contents inside, milk, ham, salad, sauce. On the floor directly in front of the fridge was some lettuce and a carton of juice. He made his way out of the kitchen and noticed the back of he kitchen door had marks on the bottom of the door.\n\nHe went through to auntie and the officer. Auntie was finishing up her statement.\n\n“Oh we had a row, we usually did bicker over the silliest things. We were finishing our dinner in the dining room when she started raving about how I don’t let her do what she wants. Things became heated, I never personally felt she appreciated what me and her uncle have done for her! She ran into the kitchen, I assumed to cool off, then she ran to the car crying and sped away”\n\nThe officer turned to uncle and told him they had found Kelsey’s phone just outside the kitchen. The screen had smashed and the touchscreen didn’t work. Uncle took the officer to one side and explained the phone call. He then pointed out his findings in the kitchen that linked to that call.\n\nShortly afterwards Auntie was arrested for attempted murder and manslaughter.\n\nWhat had auntie done to Kelsey?\n\nBONUS POINTS \nwhat caused Kelsey to crash?\nWhat had happened after dinner?",

Lisa was a police officer and Paul was an actor working at the theatre with David. \nOne night Lisa went to see Janine and noticed something strange. The car in the garage was running but no lights were on. Lisa made her way inside using the spare key hidden under a rock in the driveway and made her way into the garage.\nThere she found Janine inside her car looking as if asleep. A hose attached from the exhaust was inserted into the window. She called in to the police her discovery and then rang David to let her know what had happened. \nHowever David had his phone turned off as there was a show performing that night. Paul always had his turned on and Lisa rang him instead. \nLisa: “Paul, hi it’s Lisa.”\nPaul: “Hiya Lisa”\nLisa: “Can you put David on please I need to talk to him” \nPaul: ”Why what’s up Lisa?”\nPaul was always a bit pushy and Lisa had early learned in their relationship it was best to let him know so he didn’t keep asking too many questions.\nLisa: “I’ve just been to see Janine. Paul she’s sat in her car and gassed herself. Janine’s dead. I need to tell David, please can you pass me over to him?”\nPaul understood, he was always supportive, if not a bit too intrusive, with his wife’s work. He went to David. Lisa could hear them talking down the phone.\nPaul: “Dave?”\nDavid: “That was a good number that Paul, nice one. Who’s that?”\nPaul: “David, it’s Janine”\nDavid: “What’s happened? Give me that quick. Hello”\nLisa: “Hiya Dave it’s Lisa.”\nDavid: “Lisa is everything ok”\nLisa:  “No it’s not, it’s Janine. You need to come back here. I’m on my way over to the theatre can you tell them that you need to go?”\nDavid: “what? I... sure I guess. What’s happened?”\nLisa: “Il explain when I am there”\n\nShe hung up the phone and took another look at Janine. Then she rung the police again.\nLisa: “ Hi, I just called in a suicide. I may have some evidence to suggest the contrary and that this was actually a murder. Can you send me support to the theatre please?” \n\nWhat alerted Lisa to switch her thoughts from a suicide to a murder?\n\n",

Police had found bulletholes in the cupboard under the kitchen sink but no bullet wounds upon Mr Smith. \n\nHis ex wife came forward and admitted that she and her new boyfriend had taken it upon themselves to ‘scare’ him by waving a gun at him and fire warning shots into the cupboard (James had been over obsessive since their divorce) After the shots had been fired they blocked the kitchen from the sitting room to further scare him. This was the only way in or out of the kitchen.\n\nWhen the police had arrived the door was indeed blocked by the couch and they had to move that to get into the kitchen. They came upon the scene as described above and the only other distinguishable feature was the smell of a swimming pool coming from the sink.\n\nHis ex wife stated that when they came it was only to scare and as they hadn’t actually shot James, they weren’t to blame for his death. She also said that her and her boyfriend stayed in the sitting room for 5 minutes just so they could hear him panicking from the other side. He was screaming “let me out, let me out!”.\n\nThe police later arrested his ex wife and boyfriend for murder and claimed that they both knew what they had done once they fired the gun. \n\nHow did James die and how did the police know that it was a murder? \n\n\nNote - it has been a long time since I have thought up riddles so go easy on me guys.
