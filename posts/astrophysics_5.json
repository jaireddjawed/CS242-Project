Once an object crosses its boundary, **we can only imagine what happens, since nothing comes back with any vital information about its destination**.\n\nHowever, in 1974, **Stephen Hawking proposed that interruptions in quantum fluctuations caused by the event horizon, result in a type of radiation very similar to thermal radiation**.\n\n \n\nIf this Hawking radiation exists, it is too weak for us to detect yet. We may never separate it from the static hiss of the Universe. Fortunately, scientists tested its properties by creating black hole analogues.\n\n### The experiment\n\nA one-dimensional chain of atoms served as a path for electrons to \"jump\" from one position to another. By adjusting the ease with which this jump can occur, physicists could make certain properties disappear, effectively creating a kind of event horizon that interferes with the wave nature of electrons.\n\nThe effect of this false event horizon **produced an increase in temperature that matched theoretical expectations for an equivalent black hole system** , but only when part of the chain extended beyond the event horizon.\n\nThis could mean that the entanglement of particles straddling the event horizon is critical to generating Hawking radiation. The one simulated by the scientists was only thermal for a certain range of hop amplitudes, suggesting that it can only be thermal in a variety of situations and when there is a change in spacetime warp due to gravity.",

So if a Strange particle comes to earth by any chance, the whole earth will convert to a ball of strangelets.*\n\n*This is however a hypothesis on how they interact with normal matter, but I think strange quarks are proved.*",

I also shake my head because they do not understand the math and physics behind it.\nI believe the reason behind it is not that the earth is rotating \"fast\" at all. It is purely relative. Velocity is just a ratio of distance per unit time. Well to calculate the velocity that earth rotates you need the circumference divided by hrs in 1 day.

        "text": "A unified expansion rate for the universe sounds an awful lot like putting our little earth (or A big bang) at the center of the known universe. I am NOT an astrophysicist, nor do I have a degree so it is entirely possible that I am missing something that a more patient study would remedy.\n\nImagine a meteorologist's radar and satellite data, in a three dimensional space, without the earth. Low pressure systems (voids) and high pressure systems (super clusters) would be dancing without ceilings or floors. We, looking out as we are dragged by our galaxy and sun, see what moves with us and not. Still, our data is old and in the light years it took to get here all regions of space have evolved. \n\nRather than assuming that all regions of space are in some neat little bubble expanding in an orderly fashion, it seems much more likely that as our perspective zooms out from earth we will find that pockets of space (in clusters of celestial objects of voids) are following a measurable and predictable journey from chaos to something quite orderly along cosmological filaments and structures, evolving into something beyond our understanding or perceivable universe.\n\nIn the great end, I wonder, does gravity have a plan?",

Like how some animals can “see” magnetic fields?\n\nThis might be a stupid question that doesn’t really make sense but it’s making my head hurt trying to figure it out.",

Is a black hole really 'just' absorbing mass and releasing energy to result in nothingness?\n\n",

So if the James Webb Telescope which has a larger mirror, and can see more into the infrared spectrum, would mean that we could see galaxies which are even further than 13 Bilion years? maybe even matter before it even formed galaxies?\n\nI mean, will James Webb expand our observable unniverse?",
