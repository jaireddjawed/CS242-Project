A structure in the sense that we have the wisest of humans, that genuinely really care about people and have a true understanding of our position here on earth that can pass down knowledge to the rest of us, generation to generation. To teach us the values of being part of a stable global system and teach us how to be grounded, cooperative, responsible and happy. Creative, open mided, stuctured and smart. This can be recycled throughout our history, the wisest telling their teachings to people who for the most part do not have the time to dwell on such things. To the point where our global society itself is aware enough to work together and survive the eons.",

        "text": "\nI think there is one main human philosophy we must all strive for that can stand the test of time and start our progression to the next stage of our existence, no matter our differences. At the end of the day, we will all still be and all are human (we are all advanced cell structures that experiences  intelligence unfathomably better than that of other primates and other species). The state of this world is a disgrace to our human potential and a disgusting legacy to leave our decendants in the long run, the next tenants of earth. They will all learn from the world now and either correct our mistakes... Or follow and not learn from them (as the famous saying goes , history repeats itself), unless we collectively act together to teach the humans of tomorrow that nobody is perfect and that we can collectively live together. Its really easy to see once you have comprehended it. We can observe from most the population on the international and national scale we CAN!!!! live together. It is humaties current global system that is the problem. We are the people of our time and we have virtually zero collective understanding our situation here on earth (the broadest statements I can think of) and the fools who govern our species at this point are doing nothing to help us (the people) understand the prospect and privileges of our unity. Humans are great, all of us, our global diversity is an historical tragedy that can be fixed by our (modern) collective ingenuity (literally the worst product of our species is the lack of so). We have not been taught the ways we could and should have been by our ancestors, as have they not been by theirs (which cannot be blamed, such a thought wasn't really on the table to think of by that point). We need to be the pioneer's.",

I fear greatly that AI will kill my job and the software development field as a whole very soon.  \n\n\nA little about me:   \nI'm 23 years old (M, he/him). I have not gone to college, I'm a self taught web developer (JavaScript, Rust, AWS), so no degree. Since ChatGPT 3 came out, I've had several moments in which I feel that the last three years of my life have been a complete waste because I'm worried that soon I'll be automated out of my job and perhaps my career. I'm competent with front end web development, but prefer backend web development. I'm fortunate enough to have a relatively high paying job and a great position at the company I work at.  \n\n\nBack to the issue:  \nAm I right to be paralyzed with fear? Should I start training to enter a different field? Will the field of software engineering be okay? Should I continue in my path? What should I do to increase my job security against AI?  \n\n\nIf my field is doomed, how long do you think I have left in this field and which professional fields have the most security against AI?  \n\n\nThank you in advance for your time and efforts in answering my questions! :)",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being used in a wide range of commercial applications, and it is expected to continue to grow in popularity and importance in the coming years. Many companies are already using AI to automate tasks, improve customer service, and gain insights from data.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that AI is a broad and rapidly-evolving field, and different types of AI technology are at different stages of maturity. Some areas of AI, such as natural language processing and computer vision, have made significant strides in recent years and are already being used in commercial products and services. Other areas, such as general artificial intelligence (AGI) and quantum AI, are still in the early stages of development and may not be commercially viable for several years, if not decades.\n\nOverall, while AI is already being used in a wide range of commercial applications, there is still a lot of room for growth and development in the field. Companies that are able to stay on top of the latest trends and advances in AI will likely be well-positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities that the technology offers. We are speaking of companies that hire the best talent/globally leading experts in the field to head up R&amp;D, companies that are positioned to become default providers in this space, and that already have the capabilities to scale these new technologies (look at $VERS.NE for example).",

These issues have caused and will continue to cause immense suffering to individuals, families, communities and societies around the world and could ultimately drive humanity to extinction.\n\nThus, the question becomes more and more important whether a universal ethics/basic law, which all people know and are obliged to respect, and a global moral education based on it, could improve the future of  people and all of humanity.\n\nI believe that a universal ethics/basic law for all people and a global moral education would 1) provide a common moral language that facilitates intercultural, interethnic and interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution, 2) help address and reverse the root causes of our existential  threats such as clima change, wars and crime, 3) guide individuals and societies in their decisión-making processes, and 4) promote a sense of global citizenship and shared responsibility. ‘Education is the most powerful weapon to change the world’ (Nelson Mandela).  \n   \n Discovering a rational basis for a global ethics, which has a universal normative force, but assumes cultural, ethnic and religious/ideological differences, and setting up this ethics and implementing it in the school curricula and the constitutional law of all countries, however, is not easy. Although it is possible, according to [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43545-022-00350-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43545-022-00350-7).\n\nBy establishing a culture of peace, justice and sustainability through education and law, I believe we could create a better world for ourselves and for future generations.",

I see that maybe the world as we know it will exist maybe for another 1-5 years? That no planning is meaningful and after that the future could be awesome or none at all, just (again) like when you are told you have cancer and you realize your mortality and urgency.\n\nI am getting thoughts of selling everything, quitting my job and travelling full time but it doesn't feel like when people do it because they want to experience the world but more like they want to have fun during their last days. \n\nI don't think a psychologist could do much good unless he can understand the singularity and exponential things happening right now.\n\nMaybe the stoics were right to just live your life like it's your last one but who really implements that in practice?\n\nHow do you guys keep sane?",

I think that that will make all the difference whether they would exterminate us or not. Look at it this way. Us humans, can love our pets. Because they are cute or funny, we want to take care of them, but most of us don't do that for sheep. We keep sheep for what they provide for us and, moreover, we exterminate bugs that we find disgusting. I think that our only chance of survival is if we can manage to get AIs to love us or care for us. Otherwise, we would either become enslaved or destroyed by them.",

        "author": "Crypto_Mango",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11d6ybh/can_neural_networks_replace_smart_contract/",
        "text": " \n\nThe rise of blockchain technology has led to an increasing number of smart contract audits being conducted. Smart contracts, which are self-executing digital contracts, are now widely used in industries such as finance and healthcare. The importance of auditing these contracts cannot be overstated, as any errors or vulnerabilities could result in significant financial losses or even compromise sensitive data.\n\nAs smart contract auditing becomes more prevalent, some have begun to wonder if the process could be automated using neural networks. Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence that can learn and adapt to data inputs, making them a promising candidate for automating complex tasks.\n\nHowever, while neural networks have shown promise in certain areas, they are not yet advanced enough to replace human auditors in the field of smart contract auditing. Smart contracts can be incredibly complex and require a deep understanding of blockchain technology, programming languages, and security protocols. Neural networks lack the necessary domain-specific knowledge to audit smart contracts effectively.\n\nFurthermore, smart contract audits require a combination of technical expertise and critical thinking skills. Auditors must be able to analyze code, identify potential vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations for improvement. These are skills that are difficult to replicate in a neural network, which relies on pre-programmed algorithms rather than independent thought.\n\nWhile there is certainly potential for neural networks to play a role in smart contract auditing in the future, it is unlikely that they will completely replace human auditors anytime soon. Instead, the two will likely work in tandem, with neural networks assisting auditors in identifying potential issues and providing recommendations.\n\nIn conclusion, the audit of smart contracts with trusted auditors such as [Certik](https://www.certik.com/), [Hashex](https://hashex.org/), [Immunebytes](https://www.immunebytes.com/), etc. is a critical component of the blockchain ecosystem, and while neural networks are a promising technology, they are not yet advanced enough to replace human auditors. It is likely that both will work together to ensure the safety and security of smart contracts in the years to come.",
